In 1930, R. A. Fisher estimated the genetic component of the variance in fertility to be 40 per cent. This estimate has been extensively cited and has served as a stimulus for other studies of the inheritance of fertility (Huestis and Maxwell, 1932; Bresard, 1950; Berent, 1953; Beckman and Elston, 1962; Imaizumi et al., 1970; Neel and Schull, 1972). Fisher's data source for this estimate was Karl Pearson's analysis of fertility correlations in the British peerage. It is the purpose of this paper to replicate Pearson's sampling procedures as closely as possible to determine whether this estimate of the genetic component of the inheritance of fertility is valid. This re-examination of the data is based on the suspicion that a secular change in fertility occurred in this period which could result in spurious correlations between parent and offspring fertilities.
Pearson et al. (1899), using Burke's Peerage, Baronetage, and Knightage, plus local birth and marriage records, extracted one thousand cases for his investigation of the correlation between sibship size and progeny number in human populations.

His results are reprinted in Table 1. The means are indicated by M, standard deviations by a, and Pearson's product-moment correlation by r. Subscripts indicate sons (i), fathers (/), daughters (d), mothers (m), and paternal grandmothers (g).
Fisher used Pearson's results to estimate the genetic variance in fertility. His reasoning involved three alternative approaches. First, since the correlation of the fertility of the granddaughters with their paternal grandmother's is half that of the granddaughters with their mothers, rgd = 0.1123, and rmd = 0.2096 (Table 1), he reasoned that this correlation is one argument for a strong genetic component. In polygenic traits, one would expect the correlation to be halved in each succeeding generation. Second, the covariance between the fertilities of the mothers and daughters is 20.9 per cent of the variance observed in the daughters. In traits wholly determined by genes, the covariance would be half of the variance; therefore, 41.8 per cent of the observed variance in fertility may be due to heredity. Third, it is possible to divide the square of the parentchild correlation by the grandparent-grandchild correlation because the parent-child correlation represents half of the additive

genetic variance while the grandparentgrandchild correlation represents a fourth of the additive genetic variance. Thus, the quotient (1/27O)2/1/47O should give a measure of the heritability of the trait. This approach, (0.2096)2/0.1123 = 39.1 per cent, and the preceding approach both ascribe approximately 40 per cent of the variance in fertility to a genetic component (Fisher, 1930).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In order to replicate Pearson's sample as closely as possible, the 97th edition of Burkes Peerage (1939) was consulted by first drawing a number from a random numbers table and then sampling every tenth page thereafter. Burkës Peerage plus local birth and death records were the sources for Pearson's study. Unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain data on females since in about 98 per cent of the cases only marriage dates and not birth dates are given for females. Since Pearson had computed correlations on males and

since we wanted to use a comparable data source, the analysis was undertaken on males only. Pearson used sons and daughters who had been married at least fifteen years at the time he did the research.
Since generation length was approximately thirty years in the British peerage, we began by sampling grandparent cohorts born from 1740 to 1800. The sample contains grandsons who had completed their fertility by the 1880's, the period in which Pearson did his research. Pearson (1899) admits that, in some cases, he sampled more than one child per family; however, he did not state what proportion of his sample consisted of sibs, so our sample is restricted to only one child per family. Our sample contains at least one man in either the first, second, or third generation who held a title. For example, on a given page a family name was selected, then the bearer of the title born between 1740 and 1800 was chosen. If he was fertile and his son and grandson were fertile, that set of three generations was chosen. These

sons and grandsons were not always title holders; even if they were title holders they were not always first-born sons.
If, for example, the title passed to a nephew in the second generation, the nephew's line was traced backwards and forwards one generation each way in order to obtain a three generation sample. This slanted the sample toward the more fertile members of the peerage as well as toward men who had at least one son. Pearson's data are also biased in this way because he examined correlations between fathers and sons, and between mothers and daughters and granddaughters.
Our sample also contains a disproportionate number of families who had been members of the peerage for a long time. Newly titled families often had to be rejected because there was no information on the sibship size of a man born in the first generation cohort. In these cases, another family on the same' page or the next page had to be sampled.

Variables available for analysis were sibship size (total number of children in the family), birth date (of the male), marriage date (of the male) and progeny number (total number of offspring ever born). Total offspring born, fertility, and progeny number are used interchangeably in this paper.
RESULTS
The correlation matrices were computed for sibship size and progeny number for each generation within each lineage. Then each individual was treated as an independently sampled case and the correlation of each individual's sibship size with progeny number computed. The correlations are shown in Table 2. Although the correlations are not significantly different from zero, they are close to those obtained by Pearson (Table 1).
Since the data were randomly selected in blocks of related individuals from three generations, treating each individual as an

independent varíate should be viewed with caution; however, it was a necessary procedure to ascertain the effects of secular change and to control for the effect of several different generations being represented in one cohort. Also, it is not clear from Pearson's discussion whether he may have manipulated the data in a similar manner. I t would have been exceedingly difficult for him to obtain 1,000 cases without disregarding lineal descent. For example, in our sample the first generation of each lineage included males born from 1740 to 1800. The environments of the ten-year birth cohort from 1740 to 1749, and that of 1790 to 1800, might have been very dissimilar.
Partial correlations were computed for the lineages and for the expanded sample. Progeny number was the dependent variable; sibship size, marriage date, marriage age, and birth date were the independent variables. The multiple correlations, variables contributing the most to the multiple correlations, and the f-statistic levels to remove the effects of the independent variables are listed in Table 2. There appears to be a secular change. Sibship size is important in the first generation, but marriage date is the variable contributing most of the variance in the multiple correlations in the two succeeding generations. When the partial correlation was computed for the expanded sample, marriage date contributed most of the variance in progeny number (Table 2).
Given the evidence from correlations and partial correlations, there is an additional method of analysis. One-way analysis of variance was computed on sibship size, progeny number, and age at marriage with groups divided into ten-year birth cohorts.
Fertility, i.e., mean number of offspring, changed through time, but marriage age did not. This points even more strongly

to a secular trend in fertility. The heritability of fertility is not comparable from one generation to the next because one cannot assume a constant environment.
DISCUSSION
Fisher (1930) acknowledged the impact of the beginning of contraceptive practices and of social forces on fertility. Then he ignored his own precautions and attributed 40 per cent of the variance in fertility to genetic effects. In computing this estimate, he is assuming a social stability for three generations that, in fact, did not exist. Because of this posited stability, Fisher is able to claim a significant amount of selection intensity since certain families are assumed to contribute proportionately more offspring to the next generation.
The estimate of genetic variance based on the square of the mother-daughter correlation divided by the grandmother-granddaughter correlation was probably a fair measure of both paternal and maternal fertility since paternal grandmother's fertilities were used. A case could be made for computing the same estimate with our data since a son's fertility is influenced by his mother's fertility as well as his paternal grandmother's. If this estimate is computed, the results suggest something other than a significant genetic component is determining fertility. Half of the covariance of Generation I with Generation II is 0.404. If one uses Fisher's third approach, one finds that the correlation is negative, (0.036)7 --0.090 = -- 0.0144. This result is clearly in marked contrast to Fisher's estimate of 0.40. Stability of environment for three generations is a precarious assumption.
It is also necessary to ascertain whether our sample is representative of the British peerage. Hollingsworth (1964) has published an historical analysis of the demography of the British peerage. He found

at the University of Oregon and computed a correlation of 0.124 between sibship size and progeny number. Bresard (1950) found that sibship size seemed to be related to progeny number in working class and farm families, groups in which there was also more stability in occupation from generation to generation. No correlations were computed and the data presented were insufficient for computing correlations.
Berent (1953) computed a correlation of 0.187 from a sample of gynecological patients in Great Britain. Kantner and Potter found an insignificant correlation (less than 0.10) using data from the Indianapolis study of couples of reproductive age during 1927-40. In 1962, Beckman and Elston computed a correlation in a sample from Sweden. However, when they corrected for the differences between ages of the spouses, the association disappeared. In other words, the secular change in fertility trends was evident even in the few years difference between wives' and husbands' ages. Duncan and coworkers (1965) found that when the duration of the marriage and wife's education were held constant, the correlation between sibship size and progeny number became insignificant. Imaizumi et al. (1970) found the correlation to be essentially zero in a Japanese rural population.
Neel and Schull (1972) computed a correlation of 0.09 for mothers-daughters and 0.07 for fathers-sons from published genealogies of Amish families. This group with a high mean sibship size (9.74 for females, 9.57 for males) places emphasis on high fertility so it could be expected that if there were a correlation and if it were due to a heritable component, it would exist in this group. Clearly, the correlation in this group is essentially zero.
MacCluer et al. (1971) used demographic data from the Yanomamo as a baseline population for a computer simula-

tion of primitive population structure. The simulation results were inconsistent with the observed consanguinity in the population when only obligatory cousin marriage was incorporated into the model. However, when a correlation between fathers' and sons' fertilities was added to the simulation model, the result matched that observed in the population. She found that males whose fathers were powerful were more likely to obtain extra wives. By changing the probabilities of polygynous matings of these sons, the simulation produced a consanguinity structure which matched that observed in the population. The correlation between sibship size and progeny numbers for fathers and sons was 0.258.
It is apparent from the re-examination of Pearson's data as well as from a review of other studies on the correlation between sibship size and progeny number that past attempts to measure the heritable component in fertility are neither valid nor reliable because of the overwhelming contribution of the social environment to fertility in human populations. Since a measurement of selection is differential fertility, it may be futile to attempt a measure of the heritability of the measure of Darwinian fitness.
Concomitant with this philosophical dilemma is the dilemma posed by man's social environment. For example, in a society such as the Amish where social values contribute to an optimization of fertility, there is no correlation between sibship size and progeny number in females, and yet in a group such as the Yanomano where infanticide is practiced, there is a significant correlation between fathers and sons. Enough studies have been done on groups in industrialized societies to indicate that the change in the social environment between generations is so great that differential fertility is not correlated to any specific

subgroup for a long enough period to have any significant impact on the genetic makeup of a particular population.
SUMMARY
A sample of the fertilities of fathers and sons in the British peerage was drawn in order to re-examine the correlation between sibship size and fertility first computed by Karl Pearson in 1899. The correlation between grandmothers and granddaughters in the British peerage was used by R. A. Fisher to estimate the genetic

component of the variance in fertility. With re-examination of the data it was found that secular change, i.e., date of marriage, was contributing a significant proportion of the correlations between sibship size and progeny number.
