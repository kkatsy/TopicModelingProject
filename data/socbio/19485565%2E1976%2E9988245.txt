ABSTRACT: Age-adjusted spouse correlations for performance on tests of specific cognitive abilities were substantially higher for couples tested in Korea than for Americans of European or Japanese ancestry tested in Hawaii. It was hypothesized that this greater spouse resemblance in Korea may be due to cultural factors such as the Korean practice of arranged marriages.

Johnson et al. (1976). Spouse correlations ples may also be greater.

in this Hawaii Family Study of Cognition were estimated from samples of 148 couples who were Americans of Japanese ancestry (AJA) and 555 couples who were Americans of European ancestry (AEA). Although AEA spouse correlations were higher for 13 of IS individual tests, in only two cases (Subtraction and Multiplication; Hidden Patterns) were these differences significant. Furthermore, both sets of correlations were relatively low. The median age-adjusted spouse correlations for the AJA and AEA samples were only +0.06 and +0.13, respectively.
The primary objective of the present report is to extend the study of assortative marriage to a third ethnic group living in a different cultural setting. The data for this cross-cultural comparison were obtained in Korea during the course of a family study conducted by Jong-Young Park (Park, 1975). The cultures of the Korean and Hawaiian samples differ considerably more than those of the AEA and AJA samples living in Hawaii; for example, one cultural difference is the Korean custom of

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The 209 families tested were residents of the city of Choon-Chun, capital of Kang-Wong-Do Province, Republic of Korea. The population of Choon-Chun is approximately one hundred thousand.
Except for members of seven families tested in one group session, each family was tested individually as a nuclear family unit. The tests employed were Korean versions of those used in the Hawaii study and are listed in Table 1. One test (the Whiteman Test of Social Perception) was sufficiently culturally loaded that it proved impossible to produce an equivalent Korean version. An amended form of this test was administered to maintain the sequential integrity of the testing procedures across groups, but it was not included in the data analysis.
Other modifications of the test battery were also required. Rather than simply translating the Primary Mental Abilities (PMA) Vocabulary Test into Korean, it was necessary to construct a new Korean

Because of problems encountered in adapting the Education Testing Service (ETS) Word Beginnings and Endings Test, only word beginnings were used in the Korean version.

method of test administration. As indicated previously, the tests in Korea were administered to individual nuclear family units. In contrast, as described in some detail by Wilson et al. (1975), tests in the Hawaii study were administered to large groups under highly standardized conditions (automated tape and slide presentations of instructions, etc.). The Mainland AEA sample is a valuable comparison group in this respect, because tests in that study were administered in the samemanner as in the Korean sample (i.e., to individual nuclear family units). Thus, the effect of method of test administration may be assessed directly by comparing the Hawaiian and Mainland AEAspouse correlations. From Table 2 it may be seen that Mainland AEA spouse correlations

are higher than those for the Hawaiian AEA couples on 12 of the IS individual tests. However, the median spouse correr lations do not differ markedly (+0.22 vs. + 0.13 for the Mainland and Hawaiian AEA samples, respectively), and for only two of the individual tests (Visual Memory, delayed; Pedigrees) arethe differences significant.
The Mainland AEA sample also provides a particularly valuable comparison group for studying the effects of ethnicity. It maybe seen in Table 2that 13of the 14 Korean spouse correlations for the individual tests are greater than those for Mainland AEAcouples and that these differences are significant for 10 of the tests. Since tests were individually administered to nuclear family units for both of these

samples, method of test administration cannot be readily invoked as a cause of the difference.
The possibility of a greater heterogeneity in the Korean sample was also examined to determine if this factor could account for the higher spouse correlations. When this possibility was investigated by Park (1975), it was found that the Hawaiian and Korean groups are highly comparable samples with regard to such variables as age, education, and occupational level.
One cultural factor which may cause a greater spouse resemblance in Korea is their custom of arranged marriages. Although this custom of seeking advice from a "matchmaker" has been declining in recent years, it was in practice when the present couples, who were all old enough to have children at least 14 years of age, were married. The custom of arranged marriages may be briefly described as follows. Parents of young persons consult a "matchmaker" to seek advice as to appropriate marriage partners. Family attributes, which are given considerable weight by the matchmaker, include such factors as reputation of the families, family status (e.g., nobility, commoner, or "lowly"), family's last name (cannot have the same last name, even if there is no known relationship in the ancestral record for five-hundred or more years), and family's lineage (cannot be cousins of any degree, even if of different last name). In addition, ability level judged subjectively and by scholastic achievement, personality, and appearance of the individuals and their parents are also considered. It is usually the case that the families involved in arranged marriages have never met. Although most marriages are between persons from the same geographic area within the matchmaker's domain, propinquity in the Western sense (e.g., met on the job or attended the same school) is not a factor.

The matchmakers are conscientious in their selection of prospective mates and sincerely try to make good matches. When the matchmaker succeeds in finding a prospective spouse, a relative is requested to make unobtrusive observations firsthand. The procedure is structured in such a way that neither family commits itself at this point and either may withdraw without causing the other to lose face. If the relative's observations are congruent with the matchmaker's report, the young persons involved are informed of the findings. Although they have the prerogative of requesting another choice, this rarely happens because it would be considered as showing disrespect for elders.
For the reasons given above, the practice of arranged marriages is a cultural factor which favors the marriage of individuals of similar ability and temperament. Thus, this practice may result in higher spouse correlations in Korea, where such factors as physical attractiveness and sheer propinquity may be less important than they are for Hawaiian and Mainland couples.
It should be noted that the AJA and the Hawaiian and Mainland AEA spouse correlations presented in Table 2 are lower than those previously reported. In a recent review by Jensen (1977), the unweighted mean of 43 spouse correlations for various tests of mental ability was +0.45. Several factors may account for this apparent discrepancy. First, as discussed by both Johnson et al. (1976) and Zonderman et al. (1977), marked age effects will inflate the spouse correlation. The highest obtained correlation between spouses is with regard to age (greater than 0.9). When test performance changes as a function of age, this effect will contribute to the spouse correlation. In both of the above studies, age adjustment of the test data was found to lower spouse correlations. Furthermore, as expected, this effect was more marked
