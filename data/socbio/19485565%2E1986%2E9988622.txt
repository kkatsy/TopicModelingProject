ABSTRACT: One of the central elements of genetic counseling is the transmission of quantitative information concerning risk of defects in an unborn child from counselor to client. In order to investigate this subject, we studied the understanding of numeric and nonnumeric descriptions of genetic risk by 190 pregnant women. Specifically, three risk issues were explored: (1) whether women were able to interpret numeric risks as percentages; (2) whether shifting denominators affected risk assessment; and (3) the comparative assessment of the risk of birth defects, in general, and the risk of a neural tube defect, in particular. Respondents were much less likely to assign the correct percentage equivalent to numeric risk information when the denominator was 1,000 rather than 100. The ability to correctly identify percentage equivalents affected respondents' quantitative assessment of the frequency of neural tube defects. Shifting the denominator from 100 to 1,000, however, did not affect women's quantitative assessment of the rarity of birth defects. In general, the respondents preserved the relative risk of birth defects and neural tube defects in their choice of descriptive terms. The majority of women evaluated serious birth defects as occurring "often" or "occasionally" and NTDS as occurring "rarely" or "very rarely."

Although researchers in medical genetics frequently test the comprehension of information that has been communicated to clients in a clinical setting (Leonard et ah, 1972; Whitten et al., 1981; Lippman-Hand and Fraser, 1979), few have explored the specific issue of how quantitative risks are assessed by recipients of genetic counseling (Lippman-Hand and Fraser, 1979). Even less attention has been paid to perception of risk information in genetic screening programs than in genetic counseling at a clinical level, even though transmitting information about genetic risk is often a central component of screening programs. We present findings from a study of 190 pregnant, middle-class, white women in suburban obstetric practices which suggest that subjective nonnumeric descriptions of

the magnitude of risk for a rare event such as a birth defect may reflect the client's thought processes as well as forced or promoted numerical responses. The importance of establishing a mutually understood set of terms for communicating information about genetic risk in education and counseling is thus emphasized.
Four specific topics were investigated, of which three reflected our interest in the process of risk perception: (1) ability to interpret numerical information and the impact of such ability on subjective, verbally framed perception of risks; (2) the effect of framing of numeric risk information upon subjective verbal perceptions of risk; (3) the perception of the relative magnitude of risk of birth defects compared to the risk of a neural tube defect. In addition, we in-

vestigated a fourth topic, the association of perceptions of the risk of a neural tube defect with the subject's opinion concerning the justifiability of aborting an affected fetus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The subjects were 190 pregnant women in the first or second trimester who were serving as historical controls for a subsequent study of the impact of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) screening on the psychological status of pregnant women. The subjects were interviewed over the telephone and had not been exposed to any form of AFP screening or genetic counseling. The content of the interview, methods of recruitment, and demographic characteristics of the sample have been described previously (Faden et al., 1982). The typical subject in this study was a white married woman expecting her first or second child as a patient of a private obstetrical practice in Baltimore County, Maryland. Educational levels and occupational status of the subjects are shown in Table 1.

The questionnaire items that we used to construct the present report explored respondents' judgments concerning risksand probability. Subjects were told that the risk of neural tube defects (NTD's) in a newborn was 1/1,000. The risk of a serious birth defect was framed in two ways: (1) a risk of 4/100 and (2) a risk of 40/1,000. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the two alternative framings, and all were asked to interpret the percentage value of 1/1,000, to select appropriate verbal descriptions of the risks of a birth defect and of a neural tube defect, and to identify in percentage terms the risks of a birth defect.
The resulting data were then coded for correct or incorrect responses. Coding the data for descriptive judgments of the magnitude of these risks required an assessment by the investigators of the commonly understood numerical equivalents of words like "often" or "rarely," and extensive latitude was permitted the subjects in this respect. For example, if a risk of 1/1,000 was associated with the adverbial description "rarely" or "very

rarely" the subject was given credit for a correct answer. However, a response of "occasionally" or "often" for this risk figure was coded as an incorrect answer.
In another aspect of the study, respondents were asked to report their opinions concerning the justifiability of abortion if the fetus were to be affected with a neural tube defect and were asked other questions concerning the justifiability of abortion under various circumstances (Faden et al., 1982).
RESULTS
INTERPRETATION OF RISKSAS
PERCENTAGES
Table 2 presents the responses to items in which the subjects were asked to express in terms of percentages (from a list of multiple choices) the probability of events that occur with a frequency of 1/1,000 (the quoted incidence of neural tube defects).
The high frequency of incorrect assessment of the percentage equivalent of 1/1,000prompted us to investigate the relationship of this outcome to the educational background of our subjects. Of the 149 women who had not graduated from a four-year college, 99 (66.4 per cent) answered that question correctly;

of the 41 college graduates, 37 (90.2 per cent) answered correctly. The difference was significant (chi-square = 8.95, p<0.01). Below the level of college graduate there was no association between the subject's educational level and ability to interpret 1/1,000correctly.
In another part of the questionnaire, when 93 subjects were presented with a denominator of 100, 69 (74.6 per cent) correctly identified the risk of 4/100 as equivalent to 4per cent, whereas only 40 of 97 (41 per cent) presented with a denominator of 1,000 correctly identified 40/1,000 as 4 per cent. This difference was highly significant (z = 4.591, p < 0.01). More than one-fourth of all subjects could not correctly identify 1/1,000 as less than 1 per cent, although the other choices were off by two orders of magnitude, i.e., "10 per cent" and "greater than 10 per cent."
Respondents' qualitative assessment of the frequency of neural tube defects was affected by their ability to identify the percentage equivalent of 1/1,000 (Table 3). Women who overestimated

EFFECT OF FRAMING ON RISK
ASSESSMENT
The overwhelming majority of respondents evaluated serious birth defects asoccurring either occasionally(53 per cent) or rarely (25per cent). Framing theprobability as4/1,000 or40/1,000 had noeffect on women's perception of the rarity of the event.
PRESERVATION OFRELATIVE MAGNITUDE
IN RISK ASSESSMENT
Subjects whohadbeen told that serious birth defects occur in40/1,000 births and NTD's in 1/1,000 births tended to preserve the relative magnitude of these two events in their choice of descriptive terms (Table 5). Themajority ofwomen evaluated serious birth defects asoccurring "often" or "occasionally," and NTD's as occurring "rarely" or "very rarely." Those women who had been given the4/100 framing for serious birth defects were not included inthis analysis because the purpose wasto assess consistency within agiven framing ofthe denominator.

RELATIONSHIP OF RISK PERCEPTION TO
OPINION CONCERNING THE
JUSTIFIABILITY OF ABORTION FOR NTD
The data show that there is no relationship whatever between a woman's perception of the rarity of NTD's and her opinion concerning the justifiability of aborting a fetus affected with this condition. Of 173 respondents to this item, 134 felt that abortion was justifiable if there was a high risk of NTD in the fetus. Of these women, 107 (79.9per cent) considered NTD to occur rarely or very rarely. Of those 39 women who felt that abortion of an affected fetus was not justifiable, 31 (79.5 per cent) agreed that NTD occurred rarely or very rarely. These proportions were nearly identical. Thus, the subjects' ethical judgment concerning the justifiability of abortion for an affected fetus did not appear to be associated with their assessment of the frequency of the condition.
DISCUSSION
A principal emphasis in genetic counseling is the effective communication of recurrence risks, incidence rates, and other probabilistic information to clients. The ability of recipients to learn and recall such information has been used as a measure of the success of genetic counseling (Leonard et al., 1972). This emphasis reflects the belief that only accurate numerical assessment of genetic risks will properly facilitate informed decisions regarding reproduction.
Unfortunately, there is great uncertainty about the basic processes involved in the learning of probabilities. We lack systematic appreciation of the mental steps taken in the comprehension of numerically expressed uncer-

tainty. A person may decipher probabilistic information by a process of deductive logic but also by intuition, as by a mental picture of a relative length of two line segments or in a more structured visual image like a graph or a pie chart. In the case of genetic counseling it is not known whether or in what ways the ability to perform basic numerical operations with recurrence risks or rates (e.g., translation of these rates into percentages) is related to understanding of the meaning of these rates. Our own findings on this issue are somewhat inconsistent. In the case of serious birth defects, women's descriptions of the magnitude of risk (e.g., rarely vs. often) was not associated with the ability to translate the incidence rate into its percentage equivalent. Possibly the greater familiarity of our subjects with birth defects accounts for this finding. However, in the case of neural tube defects, there was a significant association between women's comprehension of the incidence rate in percentage terms and their perception of the likelihood of this defect. Women who overestimated the percentage equivalent or 1/1,000 were significantly more likely to view NTD's as occurring "often" and "occasionally.",e
Possibly the greater familiarity of our subjects with birth defects accounts for the findings. When experience does not supply the information required to generate an accurate verbal perception of risk, one must resort to theoretical knowledge. This interpretation reflects recent speculation that base rate information is important principally when dealing with new situations (Ajzen, 1977). In our sample, over 76 per cent reported knowing someone who had a serious birth defect. Thus, these women had ample prior and personal experience on which to base their perception

that birth defects occur occasionally or rarely. By contrast, only 17 per cent of our sample knew what a neural tube defect was, and only 3.7 per cent knew someone who had this condition. The only information on which the women could base their judgment about frequency was thus the probabilistic information provided to them, and in this case the ability to convert rates into percentages did affect judgments of likelihood.
If the ability to translate rates into percentages is a necessary component of the understanding of probability and if such information affects perceptions of risk in novel situations, then genetic counselors face a formidable educational task, particularly with those who are not highly educated. In our study, fully 33per cent of women with less than a college education could not recognize that 1/1,000was equivalent to less than 1 per cent, even when the other alternatives in this multiple choice question were off by two orders of magnitude.
This finding is not surprising, however, when placed in the context of the general educational literature on performance with percentage computations. Despite the presumably universal exposure to per cents of students in the public schools (Kramer, 1966), observation and research indicate that students have difficulty in learning the subject, and their grasp does not improve as they move through the public school system. In an early study, Guiler found that 90 per cent of ninth-graders could not readily calculate a number when a per cent of that number is given (Guiler, 1946). The more recent National Assessment of Educational Progress also found that both school children and adults had limited ability to manipulate per cents in problems, including both transforma-

tion of fractions into their equivalent percentages and the problems mentioned from the Guiler study (Carpenter etal., 1975).
Turning now to the issue of framing effects in the presentation of numeric probabilistic information, we found no evidence in this study of the widely held view that numerators dominate denominators in clients' perceptions of genetic risk information (Lippman-Hand and Fraser, 1979). If this bias had operated in our study, women presented with birth defect rates of 40/1,000 would have judged birth defects as more likely events than those women who were given the rate 4/100. We can only speculate as to why we failed to identify a numerator bias in this case. Perhaps both numerator and denominator information were ignored in both framings, and judgments about likelihood employed some variation of the "availability heuristic" in which estimates of probability are influenced by the ease with which examples of the event come to mind rather than by probabilistic information (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973).
Subjects in this study were generally internally consistent in their use of ordinal, verbal phrases to describe risk. Specifically, women tended to select appropriately different phrases to describe the frequency of birth defects and neural tube defects. This finding might be interpreted as supporting an increased reliance on nonnumeric descriptions of probability in genetic counseling, a practice already common among genetic counselors (Lippman-Hand and Fraser, 1979; Bloch et al., 1977). However, there are several good reasons for not making nonnumeric information the only or even the major mode for communicating probabilistic information in genetic counseling. Several studies have

demonstrated that the numeric "equivalents" people attach to probability phrases are highly sensitive to the context in which these judgments are made (Lichtenstein and Newman, 1967; Simpson, 1963; Cohen et al., 1958). For example, while in our study the adverb "rarely" was much more frequently selected to describe the frequency of neural tube defects (0.1 per cent) than the frequency of serious birth defects (4 per cent), in other studies this adverb has been associated with probabilities between 5 per cent and 7 per cent (Lichtenstein and Newman, 1967; Cohen et al., 1958). Because people differ so much in the way they use and quantify probability phrases, it is perhaps not surprising that recipients of genetic counseling appear to prefer numeric to nonnumeric information (Bloch et al., 1979). Although verbal expressions of

probability no doubt play an important role in genetic counseling, they are not a fully satisfactory substitute for numeric probabilities. An alternative response to the recognition that people have difficulty in interpreting such information is to develop improved techniques for effective presentation. In addition, further insight into the processes by which quantitative information is acquired and processed will help genetic counselors to deal with their clinical task more successfully.
