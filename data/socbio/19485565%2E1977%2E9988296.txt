Separation of Common Environment and Dominance Effects with Classic Kinship Correlation Models

ABSTRACT: Common family environmental effect (2) and dominance effect (d2) are usually confounded; either or both may make the sib-sib correlation larger than the parent-child correlation. The classic three kinship correlations (parent-parent, parent-offspring, sib-sib) can accommodate either dominance (Model D) or common family environment effects (Model C), but not both. The relationship between the various components of the three correlations of Models D and C are given. In order to include both dominance and common family environment effects, a fourth correlation, that between half-sibs, is added to the system which enables us to separate the dominance effects from the common family environment effects. Half-sibs may constitute a potentially new source material for study of quantitative inheritance. The principle of the constant heredity/environment ratio is discussed.

Similarly,

One may not like these names; the author himself is reluctant to propose new verbal names. The main point is, however, that the two fractions g2 and h2 have entirely two different meanings and should be kept apart and, whenever possible, should be estimated separately in empirical studies.
The fractions g2 and h2 enter into the expressions for various kinship correlations either jointly or separately, so that we have to deal with three fractions: g2 h2, and g%2. The usual terminology--

h = r(Y,Z) = crylo-z,
e = r(E,Z) = <TE/(TZ, h2+ e2 = 1.

KINSHIP CORRELATION MODELS
D AND C
Let us first examine Model D: There is dominance but no common family environmental effects (Fig. 2). Let rPP(Z,Z) = rPP be the observed correlation between the two parents' phenotypes (at the Z level). This is the primary source of assortative mating. Let rP0 and r00 be the observed (at the phenotype Z level) parentoffspring and sib-sib correlations, respectively. From Figure 2 we may express the three observed correlations as follows:

rPP = mlg2h2, TPO = y ( l +rPP)g2h2,

In using Model C, we note h02 + e02 + y2 = 1 for the complete determination of the child's phenotype (Wright, 1921, p. 116). This is also the model adopted by Li (1975, p. 324) in analyzing Jencks et al.'s (1972) data on kinship correlations.

dental as well as accidental environmental effects uncorrelated with each other or with genotype value Y. In any case, as far as its contribution to sib-sib correlation is concerned, y2 = e2 · r(E,E).
Now we are in a position to compare the Models D and C. For a given set of observed values of (rPP, rP0, r00), it will be found that m0 = m. That is, the genetic correlation between the parents remains the same in both models. The relationships between the other components of the two models are:

h2 = g2h2 = 2r,0/(l + rPP), (CD1)

*<>2 = i (

(CD2)

y2 = ±d2h2.

(CD3)

Thus, Model C always yields a smaller heritability than Model D, as h02 < h2. Part of the dominance effects, 14 d2h2, of Model D becomes the common family environment effect y2 of Model C. The random environmental effects of Model C is always larger than that of Model D, as indicated by (CD2). The three expressions above represent a reshuffling of the various effects between the two models.

HALF-SIB CORRELATION

A variable Pis introduced to represent the common family environment which contributes to the correlation between full sibs.
There are, of course, other ways of expressing the influence of the common family environment on sib-sib correlation. In lieu of the separate T factor, we may introduce a correlation between the environments of full sibs reared together, viz., r(E,E). This correlation preserves the relationship h2 + e2 = 1, but the environmental factor E no longer represents inci-

With three observed correlations, we can only solve for three unknowns. Thus, Model D includes g2 but not y2; Model C includes y2 but takes g = 1. In order to include both g2 and y2, a fourth observed correlation providing the fourth equation will be needed. However, it is not automatically sufficient to obtain the correlation between any other relatives. For instance, the correlation between grandparent and grandchild is (Fisher, 1918):
r(GP,GC) = ± (1 + m)(l + rPP)g2h2.
This expression involves two unknowns,

m and g2h2, which may be solved from previous equations for rPP and rP0. In other words, the equation provided by r(GP,GC)merely makes a part of the system "over-determined," leaving the remaining part "under-determined."
The simplest kinship correlation that yields a fourth equation independent of the previous three is that between half-sibs reared together (Fig. 4). In calculating the half-sib correlation (see [4] below), only the linear values of the three parents and their genetic correlation m are needed. Note that in Figure 4 it is assumed the genetic correlation between L t and L2 (two fathers, say) is also m, the same as that between mates (L, Lo) and mates (Lo, L2). This is equivalent to assuming that the second mate is chosen from the same subpopulation or assortative group as the first mate, without any particular change in her mating behavior. The correlation between two individuals depends upon the group from which they are chosen and

does not depend on sex or marriage. Since Ll and L2 are chosen from the same assortative group of mates, they are correlated to the same extent. Rao, Morton, and Yee (1974, 1976), in studying half-sib correlation models, have made the same assumption, taking the genetic correlation between Lx and L2 to be m also.
However, since the correlation r(Lu Lz) depends on the mating behavior of the common parent Lo, a general model may be devised to yield a range of possible r(Lt, L2) values between m and m2 (Wright, personal communication). On the other extreme, Loehlin (personal communication) points out that if the second mate is chosen as closely resembling the first as possible, then the correlation between the two fathers would be larger, not smaller, than m. In view of all these possibilities, the writer, concurring with Rao, Morton, and Yee (1974), thinks that in the assortative mating population as a whole, the assumption that the successive mates are chosen from the same subpopulation is still the most reasonable one.
Let r0,0 be the observed correlation between half-sibs. Then the four equations for the four unknowns (m, g, h, y) are:

rPP = m/g2h2,

(1)

rP0 = \ (1 + rPP)g2h2,

(2)

rOo = -5- (1 + m)g2hi + ± d2h2

(3)

ro'o = -^-(1 + Zm)g2h2 + y2.

(4)

These equations are easily solved, thus

selection (known or unknown) process involved in adoption. Half-sibs are born, not artificially selected. The practical difficulty in using half-sib correlation is its paucity in literature, but the situation may change in the near future. With early marriage, early divorce, and early remarriage, there are now a large number of half-sibs in the population. The problem is how to seek them out. The half-sibs will constitute a potential source material for various types of studies.
There is possibly another type of selection bias in studying half-sibs. Example: Nichols (1970, cited by Loehlin et al., 1975, p. 119) reported, with respect to height, the correlation for full sibs is 0.25 but that for half-sibs is 0.43. This is consistent neither with heredity nor with environment but may be explained by selecting similar half-sibs by the sampling process of the study.
A final precaution in using the four equations (1-4) is that the four kinship correlations must be obtained from the same population, or better still, from the same families. A family may have both full sibs and half-sibs.
DISCUSSION

main the same whether Y and E are corre-

lated or not. This principle of constant

path coefficient ratio has been employed

by Wright (1931) when he formulates a

new equation by transferring the ratio of

two path coefficients of one situation to

another. A numerical demonstration of

this property was provided by Li (1975, p.

133) in which psp, = 0.60193/0.32103 for

correlated causes; and p2/pt = 0.76847/ 0.40985 for uncorrelated causes. In either

case, the ratio isp2lpi = 1.875.

The principle of constant ratio for path

coefficients enables us to convert a path

coefficient of one situation to that of another. From (5), h2 + e2 = 1 - 2 hse.
