Throughout the world, legal abortion services have increasingly been included as a component of health care. The United States has now joined the growing number of nations that have for various reasons determined that abortion services should be legally available. In some countries, the legalization of abortion services has been a direct response of policymakers to the need for controlling the rate of growth of the population, while in other nations legalization has resulted from a recognition of individual rights.

more or less available in order to evaluate the demographic effects of these changes.
Frederiksen and Brackett (1968) established four classes of prototype situations for the provision of legalized abortion services to examine the relative demographic effects of abortion. Their classification was as follows: (1) large-scale abortion introduced where there is a widespread use of contraception; (2) large-scale abortion introduced where there is a widespread use of illegal abortion; (3) large-scale abortion introduced where contraception is

graphic effects of abortion. Evaluating the demographic effects of abortion is not a simple task. Many basic issues, such as the effects of available abortion services on contraceptive use, remain unanswered. But some indication of the demographic consequences of abortion can be studied. One approach to examining the demographic effects of abortion has been to analyze fertility data from countries in which legal abortion services have been made either

From the worldwide experience with legal abortion services, Frederiksen and Brackett examined each category in the classification to evaluate the demographic effects of abortion under the four possible situations. From this analysis, they concluded: (1) An increase in the number of legal abortions was followed by an increase in illegal abortions. (2) Where contraception is widely practiced, the availability of legal abortion services may result in a decrease in the effectiveness with which

ception. (3) When contraception is introduced where abortion is widely practiced, the resulting decline in the abortion rate may parallel a decline in fertility rates.
In their discussion, Frederiksen and Brackett (1968) raise many important issues. They ask whether abortion and contraception would be more effective and efficient in combination as a substitute for the use of contraception without abortion; and they imply that other situations, such as the introduction of abortion where contraception is not widely practiced, deserve further investigation as to their demographic significance.
Attempting to observe fertility rates that are the result of complex social, economic, and psychological interactions in such a manner as to differentiate the effects of abortion is a difficult task. Fortunately, mathematical demographers have developed models which can be used to study the effectiveness of abortion in population limitation where effectiveness is measured by the number of abortions that are required to substitute for one live birth. At the same time, it must be recognized that these models omit important interactions so that the assumptions required in applying them must be clearly recognized in the analysis of the results. This article will examine some of these models, extend one of them, and discuss the public health implications of the results.
MODELS FOR ABORTION EFFECTIVENESS MEASUREMENT
Potter (1963) examined the components of the birth interval to evaluate how abortion would affect this interval, since the longer the interval, the lower the fertility rates, assuming that all other factors are constant. By this mechanism, the effect of abortion on birth intervals could provide a measure of the demographic effects

of abortion on a population's fertility rates.
Assuming the absence of contraception and that most induced abortions are performed in the second or third month of pregnancy, Potter found that 100 induced abortions account for 900 months of marriage. Without lactation, approximately 43 live births could have occurred during this length of time. Stated differently, it would require 100 abortions to substitute for 43 live births, or over two abortions for each live birth.
Extending the analysis to the situation where prolonged lactation is allowed after a live birth, the effectiveness of abortion is decreased even further. Since lactation prolongs the birth interval, only 30 live births would occur during the same period of time in which 100 induced abortions occur. In this instance, more than three abortions are required to substitute for one live birth.
When contraception is used and abortion is employed as a backup to contraceptive failure, the result is more favorable. With 90 per cent effective contraception, the mean length of time to conception during ovulatory cycles would increase from five months to fifty months. In this instance, 100 induced abortions would substitute for 82 live births by the same logic applied in the previous examples. With prolonged lactation, 100 induced abortions would substitute for 72 live births. Potter concluded that induced abortion is much more effective when accompanied by contraception, a finding that is now generally accepted. .
Models of the effects of contraception, abortion, and sterilization on birth rates have been developed by many other investigators. The origins of such investigations can be traced to Pearl (1939) who began to think in terms of the number of pregnancies occurring over a specified interval

of time during which a woman was exposed to the possibility of pregnancy. From this basic concept relating exposure time and outcome, numerous extensions and refinements were possible, leading to more sophisticated models in recent years.
Sheps and Perrin (1963) developed a stochastic model of human reproduction by applying the theory of Markov renewal processes which included the three biological phenomena basic to the evaluation of the effectiveness of abortion for birth control: (1) fecundability, the monthly probability of conception for a woman exposed to the possibility of pregnancy; (2) the probability of a conception culminating in a live birth; and (3) the period of varying duration after a pregnancy when a woman is not capable of pregnancy as a result of postpartum suppression of ovulation. Varying the parameters yielded many different results, but the overall conclusion of the authors was that the use of more effective methods of contraception by smaller fractions of the population would depress birth rates more than the use of less effective methods of contraception by a greater fraction of the population.
Anyone who has developed models is aware that there are many problems inherent in abstracting from reality to a form expressable in mathematical terms. The result of these limitations is frequently the development of more complex models in an attempt to capture a greater degree of realism. Mathematical demography has been no exception to this quest for greater sophistication. For example, Perrin and Sheps (1964) extended their previous models of human reproduction, and Potter (1970) has applied renewal theory to determine births averted by contraception.
While models of human reproduction continue to expand in complexity, many of the basic relationships remain expressable with relatively simple mathematics.

Keyfitz (1971) has applied renewal theory to answer some demographic questions related to induced abortion. Keyfitz's model will be extended here to examine some public health implications of legal abortions.
THE KEYFITZ MODEL
The probability that a fertile woman will conceive in one month is defined as p, so that in the first month p women will be expected to conceive. In the second month, the monthly probability of conception is again p. At the end of the second month, ^(1--p) of the original group of women will have become pregnant, and so forth for succeeding months. Summing the products of the fraction who become pregnant in each month and the number of months to conception produces an infinite series whose sum is 1/p. If the monthly probability of conception, homogeneous over all women in the population, is p, then the mean number of months to pregnancy for all women in the population is 1/p.
But the mean number of months to conception must be added onto the period of time during which a woman is sterile following conception. If the length of this sterile period is defined as si, then the total time that a woman is pregnant or sterile is 1/p + Ji, assuming that there is no pregnancy wastage and that the sterile period is homogeneous over all women.
An abortion changes the period of sterility after conception, which was defined as ii for pregnancies that continued to term. The mean time to conception will remain the same, 1/p. If the sterile period, composed of the time the woman is pregnant before the abortion and the time after the abortion during which she is anovulatory, is defined as S2, then the mean length of time that a woman who obtains

contraceptive is used.

The relative effectiveness of abortion as compared topregnancy carried to term is determined bydividing the length of the sterile period from abortion into that from pregnancy carried to term,

If the efficiency of contraception is 0.95, the effectiveness of abortion is 1.14. Thus, following a different formulation, the efficiency of abortion has been derived for a population of N women on an annual basis. Since, in this formulation, N is not a function of the number of abortions nor of the number of births, the result is identical to the derivation of Keyfitz. However, this formulation is more appropriate when discussing a population of women, rather than a single woman, and equations (7) and (11) are useful for further applications.
RESULTS
The effectiveness of abortion is a function of the time in gestation when the abortion is performed. To examine how the effectiveness of abortion relates to

gestation and to determine the mediating effects of contraception, computations were performed using equation (11) under various assumptions.
To simplify the analysis, we assumed that ovulation occurs one month after induced abortion; there is only limited data available on the relation between induced abortion and ovulation (Boyd and Holmstrom, 1972), but the return of ovulation appears to be rapid. For this analysis, it was also assumed that lactation is artificially suspended after delivery so that the period of postpartum sterility is two months (Perez et al., 1971). This is an approximate estimate and many variations in the application of data to these analyses are possible; some of these will be discussed below. Finally, p is again assumed to be 0.2, and pregnancy wastage except from induced abortion is omitted.1
The results of the analysis (Table 1) indicate that, as demonstrated previously, the use of efficient contraception has a significant effect on the effectiveness of abortion. With abortion performed at three months gestation, 1.78 abortions are required to substitute for each live birth, in the absence of the use of contraception. But when a contraceptive of 95 per cent efficiency is used, only 1.07 abortions are required to substitute for each live birth.
The effectiveness of abortion is much more sensitive to the gestation of pregnancy when the abortion is performed when a contraceptive of lower efficiency is used. Comparing the performance of an abortion at one month gestation and three
1 This assumption is acceptable in this application since it simplifies the analysis without substantially distorting the results. A considerably more complex formulation which includes all pregnancy outcomes largely confirms the findings reported here (Williams, 1974). Furthermore, as discussed at the end of this paper, all conceptions are equally exposed to the risk of spontaneous pregnancy loss so that it is only a small fraction of all conceptions that might influence these results.

months gestation, the difference in effectiveness is 2.29 minus 1.78 or 0.51 when no contraception is used. This is a reduction of over 22 per cent. When a contraceptive of 95 per cent effectiveness is used, the reduction is 1.09 minus 1.07 or 0.02, a reduction of only slightly over 1.8 per cent.
These findings have important policy implications. From a demographic point of view, abortion later in pregnancy reaps considerable benefits over early abortion when contraception is not used. On the other hand, with the use of even moderately efficient contraception, this advantage largely disappears. From a practical perspective, this finding should even fur-

ther emphasize the importance of contraception, even if it is only moderately effective.
Similar calculations were performed to investigate the effects of modifying the previous assumptions to allow for prolonged lactation. While the length of lactation would not be homogeneous over all women, for purposes of simplicity we will assume that it is. Furthermore, we will assume the length of lactation to be such that suppression of ovulation lasts for eight months (Perez et al., 1971).
The results (Table 2) indicate that the sensitivity of the effectiveness of abortion to gestation is approximately the same when lactation is included as when it is

not, although abortion is more effective at all gestations and for all contraceptive efficiency levels in the absence of lactation. However, the importance of lactation is far less for populations that practice even moderately effective contraception. From a policy perspective, encouraging lactation in a population that is using moderately or highly effective contraception will not substantially increase the effectiveness with which abortion is utilized by that population.
The value of p, the monthly probability of conception, used in the computations assumes a healthy population with frequent exposure to intercourse. However, many women obtaining abortions are not engaged in frequent coital activity. Similarly, the use of contraception varies considerably.
To examine the effects of changes in the parameters p and e on the effectiveness of abortion, we assumed that abortions are performed, on the average, at three months gestation (Center for Disease Control, 1972). Without lactation, the effectiveness of induced abortion (Table 3 ) is sensitive to p only for substantive differences in that parameter when e is

constant. For example, when e is zero, increasing p from 0.10 to 0.20 only increases the effectiveness of abortion by 0.28 or 19 per cent. This increase in p is a large one, representing a doubling in the time to conception. Thesensitivity of the effectiveness of abortion to p decreases as e increases.
A similar pattern is apparent when lactation is introduced (Table 4 ) . However, with the substantially increased postpartum sterile period, the effectiveness of abortion becomes more sensitive to changes in p with e constant. For example, with e equal to zero, the effectiveness of abortion increases 26 per cent when p is increased from 0.10 to 0.20 as compared to only 19 per cent without lactation. Further, as would be expected, the absolute levels for the effectiveness of abortion are higher with lactation for all values of p and e.
From a policy perspective, these findings indicate that the effectiveness of abortion at any level of contraceptive efficiency is more sensitive to the fecundity of the women in the population when those women lactate, where fecundity is the monthly probability of conception. Lactation for a longer time than is represented in the computations for Table 4 will ac-

centuate this effect while lactation for a shorter period of time will moderate it.
Sheps and Perrin (1963) concluded that the use of more effective contraception by smaller fractions of the population would depress birth rates more than the use of less effective methods by more women. Table 3 confirms this conclusion, especially if the more effective contraception is used by the more fecund women. The number of abortions required to avert one birth are used as an indication of the relative birth rates. Comparing more fecund women (p more than 0.20) with less fecund women (p less than 0.20), the percentage reduction in the effectiveness of abortion is lower for women with lower fecundity as contraceptive efficiency increases. For example, for p equal to 0.14, the effectiveness of abortion decreases from 1.63 to 1.01, or 38 per cent as e increases from zero to 0.99. For p equal to 0.24, the reduction is from 1.86 to 1.02, or 45 per cent over the same range of e.
Since Table 3 presents values for a wide range in the parameters, it is useful to limit the ranges for p and e to those of the United States population at the current time. Unfortunately, the values of

p and e for a large population are not easily determined. However, some ranges can be estimated. Since the effectiveness of abortion is not highly sensitive to moderate changes in p and, to a lesser extent, in e, these estimates may be fairly reliable.
The value of e in the U.S. married population can be estimated from the National Fertility Study (Westoff, 1972). Using a weighted average of the use of contraception by method and estimates of the efficiency of each method, we derive a value of about 84 per cent (Table 5) when nonusers are also included with an efficiency of p. This calculation does not include single women. Since many single women obtaining abortions used no contraception (Kantner and Zelnik, 1973), it is unlikely that the overall value for e for all women in the reproductive ages is greater than about 90 per cent. Somewhat arbitrarily, we might estimate a range between 70 and 90 per cent for. women ages
The value of p is even more difficult to determine. Some highly fecund women might conceive in less than two months while many other women may require ten or twelve months to conceive. Many fac-

. For young highly fecund women using no contraception, abortion is not a very effective birth control method. The effect of abortion averaged over the entire population at risk of pregnancy is different from its effect on certain subgroups within that population. For example, women of different ages have different levels of fecun-
