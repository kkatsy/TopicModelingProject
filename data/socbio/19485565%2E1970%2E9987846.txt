Proposed Organization of an Association of Behavioral Genetics

An informal meeting of persons interested in a behavioral genetics association was held in Boston on December 28, at the time of the annual meetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Present were Jack Bresler, Tufts University, Theodosius Dobzhansky, Rockefeller University, Jerry Hirsh, University of Illinois, Richard Osborne, University of Connecticut, Sheldon Reed, University of Minnesota, John Scott, Bowling Green State University, and Jon Streng, University of Texas.
The results of John Leohlin's fall mailout from the University of Texas to 152 people who had recently published in the field of behavioral genetics was discussed. Of the 82 respondents, only five expressed disinterest in the formation of an association, and three of these on the basis of the fact that they considered behavioral genetics to be peripheral to their primary area of interest. All but IS of the remaining 77 re-

spondents expressed willingness to assist in the organization of such an association.
It was decided that a formal organizational meeting should be held, and Jerry Hirsch offered to host such a meeting at the University of Illinois, Urbana, on March 30, Letters of invitation were sent to the 62 repondents to the questionnaire who had indicated a willingness to work on an organizing committee.
On the nomination section of the questionnaire, 66 names had been proposed for the organizing committee with 26 of these receiving from S to 20 votes. To assure attendance of a group as representative of the field as possible, transportation to the meeting at the expense of the American Eugenics Society was offered to those 26 individuals receiving the most votes. A report of the Urbana meeting will appear in the June issue of Social Biology.
