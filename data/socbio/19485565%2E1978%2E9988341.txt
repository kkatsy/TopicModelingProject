ABSTRACT: From ecclesiastical and civil data on consanguinity, ageat marriage, and immigration in Chile from 186S to 1914, comparisons between urban and rural zones are made. A random mating deviation index is developed, and the values indicate deviation toward endogamy in both zones. These values show an inverse relation to those of the exogamy index developed by Freire-Maia and Freire-Maia (1963). Values in the rural zone are double those in the urban zone. In the two zones there are no clear differences in age at marriage between consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples. Thus, we might expect lower fertility in consanguineous marriages only because of a higher probability of homozygosis of deleterious genes.

Migration and inbreeding are of special interest to population genetics. The relationship between these two evolutionary forces has been shown by several authors (Cavalli-Sforza, 1962; Schull and McCluer, 1968). However, a distinction must be made between urban and rural areas in studying migration and inbreeding (Cavalli-Sforza, 1959). Also, our knowledge of the genetic structure of a population may be increased if we examine age at marriage because this parameter is an important factor in changing fertility patterns as well as in the growth of populations (Kiser, 1970).
In the present paper we focus on two zones, the city of Valparaiso, the most populated center in the province, and Casablanca commune, a rural zone on the outskirts of Valparaiso (Lazo et al., 1970) to establish relationships among immigration, inbreeding, and age at marriage and to formulate an endogamy index.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The data were obtained from the records contained in the church books of the parishes in the zones under study. Lists were made of all consanguineous marriages in the years 1865 to 1914. A random sample of nonconsanguineous marriages was chosen from the same books so that data on two equal-sized groups of marriages were obtained.
The period 1865-1914 was chosen for several reasons. First of all, it is a period long enough to permit a thorough analysis, particularly of changes in the frequency of migration or consanguineous marriages. Second, the number of marriages listed in civil and church records are very similar. Third, after 1916, Catholic canon law did not require the registration of dispensations for consanguineous marriages beyond the second cousins, and thus there are no records of the relationships in such marriages.

blanca are also characteristic of other rural areas. The same trend has been observed by different authors in Chile and other countries (Moroni et al., 1972; Quezada et al., 1973; Dolinar, 1965; Sutterand Goux, 1962).
The frequencies of consanguineous and nonconsanguineous immigrants generally show slow fluctuations throughout time, although a slight decrease in the urban zone and a slight increase in the rural zone may be noted. On the other hand, in Valparaiso, the contribution of consanguineous couples is as important as that of nonconsanguineous couples--78.6 per cent and 78.1 per cent, respectively. In the rural zone, the frequency of consanguineous immigrants is approximately SO per cent lower than that of nonconsanguineous immigrants, even though the mean values of rural immigration are much lower than those of urban immigration.
The relationship between consanguinity and immigration is shown in the data given in Table 2. There is a great difference between observed and expected values for consanguineous as well as for nonconsanguineous couples in both zones. However, these differences are greater for consanguineous couples. In every case the higher observed values are constituted by couples where both are natives or both are immigrants. This fact indicates a preferential trend toward marriage between individuals of similar backgrounds. We suppose two reasons might explain it. First, a prejudice of natives against marrying immigrants, perhaps because the native population forms a discrete socioeconomic unit (Boyce et al., 1967). Second, a proportion of consanguineous immigrants came from the same place, or the future spouses knew one another before migrating. The frequencies of couples sharing the same birthplace (see Table 3) support this argument.
Within Table 2, the chi-square tests give

the values of each case in the two zones, all of which show p > 0.001 (df:l). This analysis indicates a deviation from randorn mating and, in general, inbreeding and immigration contributed to it.
Nevertheless, these contributions are unequal so that in the urban zone the mean value of immigration is 3.79 times higher than it is in the rural zone, but the mean inbreeding coefficient is 4.95 times lower in the urban zone than in the rural zone.
The mean difference between observed and expected values divided by the total number of marriages may be assumed to provide a mean index of deviation from random mating. However, before calculatihg such an index, we should make two observations.
First, Table 2 shows a greater number of immigrant males than females. Thus, a fraction of them cannot marry an immigrant woman even if they wished to. For this reason, the values of the deviation from random mating must be measured in terms of sex. For instance, on the left side of the table we observe 848 immigrant women and 935 men. Consequently, the maximum number of marriages among immigrants is 848, and this value represents the total theoretical deviation (T). On the other hand, the expected value is 696.12, which represents the opposite value or total theoretical random mating (£). The number of couples observed (O) among immigrants is 743, and this value is between T and E. Then, the difference T - E may be estimated as 100 per cent of

the random mating deviation, and the difference O - E divided by T - E may be estimated as a reasonable measure of the deviation from random mating when immigration is present.
A second observation is about consanguineous marriage frequencies which are 2.37 (urban) and 15.18 (rural). In turn,
nonconsanguineous marriages have frequencies of 97.63 per cent (urban) and 84.82 per cent (rural). Therefore, the contribution of consanguineous and nonconsanguineous marriages to the index must be obtained from these frequencies. The index (/) is given by: / = 2[P(O -- E)I(T -- E)], where P is the frequency and where the sum is the contribution of consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples.
According to this formula, the values obtained, 17.70 for urban and 34.56 for rural, indicate that the rural value is approximately double the urban value. We can see the relationship between these values and the exogamy index of FreireMaia and Freire-Maia (1963). According to their definition, the values for the exogamy index would be 76.44 for the urban area and 34.60 for the rural area, according to the frequencies of Classes 2, 3, and 4 of Table 3. As the consanguineous marriages are endogamous by definition, we obtained these values only from nonconsanguineous couples. The values for the exogamy index are approximately doubled in the urban zone and, as we expected, in inverse relation to the random mating deviation index.

Finally, as a preliminary study of age at marriage, we show in Table 4 the age distribution frequencies of nonconsanguineous and consanguineous males and females in each zone. At the foot of this table we included the mean (X), variance (S2), and the variation coefficient (SIX).
Great differences are not observed between the zones, although nonconsanguineous males and females marry slightly later, particularly nonconsanguineous males. Variance values are greater in the urban zone, but male variances are generally lower than female variances. In the same way, variation coefficients are lower in males in both zones.
In general, a higher average difference should be expected between consanguineous couples than between nonconsan-

guineous ones because marriages of Types 12 (uncle-niece) and 23 (aunt-nephew) belong to different generations. However, the data showed similar values. Thus, we might posit that consanguineous and nonconsanguineous mates marry at similar ages and/or the frequencies of Types 12 (uncle-niece) and 23 (aunt-nephew) are approximately the same.
The fact that differences in age at marriage do not exist between consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples is an important finding. From the point of view of fertility, we can expect a similar length period of fertility for consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples. In this case we might expect lower fertility in consanguineous marriages only because of a higher probability of deleterious genes.
