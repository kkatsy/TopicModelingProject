ABSTRACT:The epidemiologic transition theory focuses on the changing patterns of morbidity and mortality and postulates that mortality by cause will evolve from a predominance of acute and infectious diseases to a predominance of chronic and degenerative diseases. The epidemiologic transition theory comprises three stages: the age of pestilence and famine (lasting until 1875), receding pandemics (from 1875 to 1930), and degenerative and man-made diseases (from 1930 to the present). Recent information suggests that developed societies have entered a new stage in the transition. This fourth stage, which we term the hybristic stage, is increasingly influenced by individual behaviors and life-styles. In this paper, we examine the epidemiologic transition theory, substantiate the need for a new stage, and discuss current cause-specific trends in mortality and the social and demographic implications of such trends.

nal cancer patients die of pneumonia, influenza, or septicemia. Such examples highlight the interplay of infectious and chronic diseases.
The theory postulates that infectious diseases will decline, but will not be entirely eradicated. Although the theory applies to different sets of countries and how they have proceeded through the transition, we confine our analysis to the United States. In the United States, infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, influenza, cholera, and diptheria represented 53 per cent of all deaths in 1900, but only 6 percent in 1970 (Omran, 19776). However, many infectious diseases, including smallpox, have been eradicated. Immunizations in the United States have almost eliminated poliomyelitis and diphtheria and potentially can eliminate measles. Because the theory's last stage does not account for the possible total eradication of infectious diseases, some age groups or specific subpopulations may have progressed past the last stage in the epidemiologic transition theory.
The epidemiologic transition theory posits that, with time, chronic and degenerative diseases increase in importance. Between 1900 and 1970, the percentage of deaths due to heart disease and cancer jumped from 12 to 56 per cent. The theory, however, cannot easily account for decreases in mortality rates for such chronic degenerative diseases as stroke and ischemic heart disease (see Crimmons, 1981;Manton and Soldo, 1985; Rosenwaike, 1985). Figures 1and 2 illustrate the rapid decrease in ischemic heart disease and hypertension in the United States, from 1968 to 1976. Indeed, the age-adjusted death rates declined for ischemic heart disease by 21 per cent, for cerebrovascular disease by 28 per cent, and for hyperten-

sion by 46 per cent (Rosenberg and Klebba, 1979; see also Borhani, 1979). Many of these declines have been realized through medical factors and lifestyle changes, including reduced cigarette smoking, increased physical activity, and reduced intake of saturated fats.
Several causes of death, including violent deaths, have changed significantly over time, but are not considered separately under the theory. Broudy and May (1983), in their study of Navajo Indians, found that behavior-related mortality, especially violent death, was a leading cause of mortality. They added the category "social pathology," to include accidents, alcoholism, suicide, homicide, and cirrhosis of the liver. According to the theory, the Navajos had entered the last stage of the transition. However, the proportion of mortality due to degenerative diseases was rising slowly while mortality due to social pathologies was rising rapidly (Broudy and May, 1983).
Many deaths in the United States are now due to social pathologies. For example, four of the ten leading causes of death in the United States in 1984 were due to social pathologies (see Table 1). The top three causes of death for persons aged 15-24 were due to the social pathologies of accidents, suicide, and homicide and comprised over threequarters of all deaths for this age group (see Table 2). Therefore, we see the need to include categories that capture violent and accidental deaths, and deaths due to behavioral causes, in the epidemiologic transition theory.
Cancer-specific mortality best fits the theory, especially at ages 45 and over (see Crimmons, 1981). Cancer at ages less than 45, however, has not established such a clear trend. Further, mor-

past century, improvement intheexpectation of life at age 25, from all causes, has been reduced byat least one-half by smoking alone (McKeown, 1979). Thus, behavioral factors have retarded some declines in mortality.
Ravenholt (1984) has implicated abuse of addictive substances--tobacco, alcohol, opiates, cocaine, hallucinogens, stimulants, and hypnotics--with the leading cause of death in the United States in 1980. Abuse of these substances contributes to almost one-third of deaths from all causes. Tobacco smoking contributes to 25per cent of all deaths; alcohol consumption, to 5 per cent; and abuse of other addictive substances, to 1-2 per cent (Ravenholt, 1984). These substances directly increase mortality risks from cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, infections, nutritional deficiencies, cirrhosis of the liver, accidents, homicides, and suicides (Ravenholt, 1984). Thus, the focus on the increasing rise in degenerative diseases obscures thefact that many of these diseases are partially caused by individual life-styles.
FAVORED SUBPOPULATIONS WITHIN THETRANSITION
The epidemiologic transition favors females over males, whites over nonwhites (in the United States), and the

young over the old (Omran, 1982, 1983). However, many of these relations have changed, asevidenced below,
Although females exhibit higher life expectancies than males, the difference is declining. Forinstance, between1975 and 1983, life expectancy increased 2.2 yearsfor males, butonly 1.7years forfemales. The racial gap shows a similar narrowing. Between 1970 and 1983, life expectancy increased 5.5 years for blacks, but only 3.5 years for whites (NCHS, 1984; see also Crimmons, 1981). Moreover, the black/white mortality crossover effect shows that older blacks have lower mortality rates than whites in the advanced ages (Manton, 1980;Nametal., 1978).
Since 1960, general conditions, ineluding mortality, of the elderly have improved, while those of the young have deteriorated (Preston, 1984). Life expectancy has continued to increase, even at very advanced ages. Table 3 shows observed life expectancies at selected ages and years, from 1901 to 1977, and projected life expectancies to the year 2000 (Crimmons, 1981). Until recently, the younger population fchieved ^ l a r g e s t relative and absolute gains in Me expectancy. For exampie,between 1901 and 1940, life expectancies increased 29 per cent at birth,but only 8per cent at age65, and only 7 per

dominance; and how deaths due to social pathology, although prevalent, cannot be explained through the theory's present stage. Because of these trend changes, we suggest that the United States has entered a new stage, which began in the 1970's, one we term the hybristic stage. We will now endeavor to explain how this new stage extends the epidemiologic transition theory.
Hybris is an excessive selfconfidence, a belief that you cannot suffer, that you are invincible. Morbidity and mortality in the hybristic stage are affected by man-made diseases and increasing modernization as well as individual behaviors and potentially destructive life-styles. Increases in physical inactivity, pernicious dietary practices, and excessive drinking and cigarette smoking can contribute to heart disease, diabetes, chronic nephritis, lung cancer, and cirrhosis of the liver and such social pathologies as accidents, suicides, and homicides (Broudy and May, 1983; Kristein et al., 1977; McKeown, 1979).
It is interesting to note that some infectious diseases are slowly rising in importance because of individual lifestyles and man-made causes. Many of the infectious diseases could be effectively controlled, if not completely eliminated, through immunization (United Nations, 1984). Vaccines are one of the most effective disease prevention technologies available (United Nations, 1984) and are available to immunize infants and children from measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, mumps, and now meningitis. While many of these diseases have been reduced, they have not been eradicated, because as many as one-quarter to one-half of all pre-school children are not completely immunized against the above preventable diseases

in the United States (Richmond and Filner, 1979, p. 318). Evans (1985) asks whether the prospect for eradication should be considered "myth or reality," noting that the eradication of several diseases may be hamstrung through economic, political, or religious barriers. Thus, greater health may now depend on individual voluntary actions and family life-styles (Allegrante and Green, 1981).
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which is directly related to a person's behavior and life-style, can be contracted by contaminated blood products (i.e., blood transfusions), intravenous drug use (through contaminated needles), and sexual, usually homosexual, contact (Curran et al., 1985). AIDS irithe United States exemplifies causes of death in the hybristic stage. Figure 3 illustrates how quickly the number of reported cases has risen from its first diagnosis in 1981. Ninetythree per cent of all reported cases are male, and 90 per cent of all cases occur in individuals 20-49 years of age, traditionally a low-risk age group. The usual targets of infectious diseases, infants and the elderly, are at relatively low risk of contracting AIDS. Ninety per cent of all AIDS victims used intravenous drugs or were homosexuals. "For single men aged 25 to 44 years in Manhattan and San Francisco, AIDS was the leading cause of premature mortality in 1984 as measured by years of potential life lost" (Curran et al., 1985). Certainly the mortality trend of AIDS and other presentday diseases is affected by specific lifestyles, such as sexual orientation.
New infectious diseases may be qualitatively different from past diseases and from infectious diseases in developing countries. To understand and ultimately prevent AIDS, a disease that links sick-

ness to sexuality, we must recognize its biomedical and sociocultural characteristics (Parker, 1987). In Africa, AIDS appears to be more pervasive, is not concentrated in the homosexual population, and is associated with other infectious and parasitic diseases. Further, because sexual roles in Brazilian subculture are less structured and denned than in the United States, the characteristics of AIDS patients are also different. Indeed, in 1986, over 20 per

cent of the AIDS patients in Rio de Janeiro hospitals identified themselves as bisexual, a percentage that is ten times greater than that found in most hospitals in Europe or the United States (Parker, 1987). Therefore, because of different modes of transmission, associations with other diseases, concentrations, and levels of resistance, AIDS exhibits qualitatively different sociocultural and biomedical attributes in less developed countries than in the United States.

CONCLUSION
Many improvements cancome about in mortality, not only through advances in "scientific medicine," but also through a greater emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention.1 While it is disheartening to note that in some instances we may be contributing to, rather than preventing, mortality through ourown behavior and life-style, it ispromising to seethat we can directly influence these factors, thereby preventing mortality. Through additional re-
1Disease prevention and changes inbehaviors and life-styles transfers part of the responsibility for health to theindividual andfamily (Allegrante and Green, 1981). Be advised, however, that many behaviors and life-styles are shaped and reinforced through political, social, and economic forces. Itis simplistic indeed tohold solely the individual responsible for such behaviors assmoking. Other factors are involved, such as government subsidies of the tobacco industry, tax deductions for cigarette advertising, work-related stress,and until recently, general malaise concerning smoking (Eisenberg, 1977). Thus, responsibility does not rest solely with one individual or institution, but is a long andcomplex chain (Rutstein etal., 1976).

search, wehope notonly toreducemortality, but toincrease health.
Over time, mortality shifts from a predominance of infectious, to manmade and degenerative, tohybristicdiseases. The hybristic stage witnessesthe eradication of most environmentallybased infectious diseases. Those infectious diseases not eradicated are perpetuated, if not actually caused by individual behaviors and life-styles. Thus, inexplaining the increase in mortality due to social pathologies and changing life-styles, we have extended epidemiologic transition theory through the present period, with the hybristic stage.
