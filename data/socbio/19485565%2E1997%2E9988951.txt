ABSTRACT: A 1962 recipient of a Ph.D. was an average of 10.13 years from receipt of a B.A.; a 1992 recipient was an average of 12.55 years. Some authors have suggested that if the B.A.-year cohorts were compared instead of the Ph.D.-year cohorts, the average time to earn a Ph.D. would not show such a drastic increase. The author recognizes the problem with the Ph.D.-year data, but uses these data with a standardization-decomposition technique to show that 75 per cent of the increase in the time between the B.A. and the Ph.D. in 1992 was due to the change in the age-sex structure of Ph.D. recipients in favor of more women and older persons.

Total time-to-degree (TTD) measures the number of years elapsed between receipt of the baccalaureate degree and the Ph.D. (Ries and Thurgood, 1993). There has been a dramatic increase in mean TTD in the United States over the last three decades. For example, the mean TTD for doctorate recipients in 1992 was 12.55 years--an increase of 23.9 per cent from the mean TTD of 10.13 years in 1962. In the field of education, this increase during the same 30-year period was even faster (30.0 per cent)--from 14.61 years in 1962 to 18.99 years in 1992 (Tables land 2).
Students, faculty members, and those involved in making policies for education in the country have been concerned about the drastic rise in the length of time it takes to earn a doctorate. This concern has resulted in calls for reform in graduate education by media commentators and other interested persons.

In a recent paper, Bowen et al. (1991) have argued that there has been, in fact, some rise in the average TTD in recent years but that the overall picture is not at all as bad as the data seem to indicate. The average TTD is derived from students grouped by the year in which they were awarded doctorates and, according to these authors, this Ph.D.-year method of aggregation produces a highly misleading picture of trends in average TTD because of the steady fall in the sizes of entering cohorts to graduate school. They have suggested that the same data be regrouped by the year in which recipients of doctorates received their B.A. degrees. Reorganization of the data in this manner has since been suggested in another paper by Bowen et al. (1992). The B.A.-year method of aggregation, according to these authors, is free of the potential "statistical bias" that afflicts the Ph.D.-year method. Using the B.A.-year approach, they have estimated

that the reported Ph.D.-year median for 1988 overstates the time a typical humanities graduate student spends earning a doctorate by as much as two years.
While Bowen et al. (1991) are right in pointing out the problem of overestimation of TTD based on the Ph.D.-year approach and in suggesting the use of the B.A.year method of aggregation as a solution, this latter approach has a problem of its own which is related to the availability of data to study the pattern of TTD over time. The mean TTD for the 1962 and 1992 B.A.-year cohorts, for example, will not be known until around the years 2020 and 2050, respectively (there was an 82year old Ph.D. recipient in 1992). In order to avoid the problem of long wait, if we calculate truncated measures for B.A.year cohorts after, say, ten years, as the authors have suggested, we will introduce a different kind of "statistical bias" because the relationship between the two sides of the truncation point is likely to change over time.
The objective of the present paper is to handle the problem of overestimation of TTD by the Ph.D.-year method of aggregation by an alternative approach using the same Ph.D.-year cohorts and not regrouping the data by the B.A.-year method. This new approach also recognizes the steady fall in the sizes of entering cohorts to graduate school, but takes account of this factor by standardizing the mean TTD's of the Ph.D.-year cohorts by the age structures of these cohorts. Depending on the availability of data cross-classified by other factors, such as gender and broad field, it is also possible to standardize simultaneously with respect to several factors and at the same time decompose the difference between the mean TTD's of two years into

the additive effects of these factors (Das Gupta, 1991, 1993). The data for the Ph.D. recipients of 1962 and 1992 are used for the illustration of these techniques.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
ANALYSIS OF PH.D.'S IN A BROAD FIELD BY AGE AND GENDER
For 1962,
Njj = number of Ph.D. recipients in age group i and gender/
N¡ = number of Ph.D. recipients in age group i,
Nj = number of Ph.D.' recipients in gender/
N = total Ph.D. recipients in the " field,
Tr - mean TTD of Ph.D. recipients in age group i and gender/
T = mean TTD of Ph.D. recipients in the field.
For 1992, the above quantities are denoted by n-, n¡, rij, n , t¡¡, and t, respectively.
From Das Gupta (1991; 1993, Section 5.3), we have

ANALYSIS OF TOTAL PH.D.'S BY AGE, FIELD, AND GENDER
Denoting age group, field, and gender by i, j , and k, respectively, and using analogous symbols, we can express the mean TTD's for 1962 and 1992, respectively, (Das Gupta, 1991; 1993, Section 5.4) by:

RESULTS
The basic data used for our analysis are the doctorate recipients and their mean TTD's in 1962 and 1992 crossclassified by nine age groups, seven broad fields, and gender. These data in summary form are shown in Table 1. The overall mean TTD's for all fields together are 10.13 and 12.55 years for 1962 and 1992, respectively. It is obvious from the data that there are two facts which contribute significantly to this difference. The more important fact is that the mean TTD's in both 1962 and 1992 increased with age and that a much higher percentage of older people earned Ph.D.'s in 1992 (percentages of Ph.D. recipients aged 35 and above are 34.0 and 47.5 in 1962 and 1992, respectively). The other fact is that the mean TTD's for women were higher than those for men in both 1962 and 1992 and that a much higher percentage of women earned Ph.D.'s in 1992 (10.8 per cent in 1962 as against 37.4 per cent in 1992). It is not obvious from the data whether the difference in the distribution of broad field for 1962 and 1992 had a positive or negative effect on the difference between the overall mean TTD's. Similar observations can be made on the seven broad fields from the summary data in Table 1.
Table 2 gives a more accurate picture of the effects of age, gender, and broad field obtained by applying the techniques of standardization and decomposition de-

scribed in the preceding section. For all fields together, we may summarize the results as follows:
(1). The mean TTD's for 1962 and 1992 are, respectively, 10.13 and 12.55 years (an increase of 23.9 per cent). Their difference of 2.42 is the total effect of the differences in age, field, gender, and agefield-gender-specific mean TTD's.
(2). If the distributions of field, gender, and age-field-gender-specific mean TTD's were identical in 1962 and 1992, and only the distribution of .age varied, as it did, then the mean TTD's for 1962 and 1992 would be 10.53 and 11.98 years (an increase of 13.8 per cent). The difference of 1.45 between them is, therefore, the effect of the difference in the age distribution.
(3). If the distributions of age, gender, and age-field-gender-specific mean TTD's were identical in 1962 and 1992, and only the distribution of field varied, as it did, then the mean TTD's for 1962 and 1992 would be 11.26 and 11.23 years (a decrease of 0.3 per cent). The difference of --0.03 between them is, therefore, the effect of the difference in the field distribution.
(4). If the distributions of age, field, and age-field-gender-specific mean TTD's were identical in 1962 and 1992, and only the distribution of gender varied, as it did, then the mean TTD's for 1962 and 1992 would be 11.06 and 11.45 years (an increase of 3.5 per cent). The difference of 0.39 between them is, therefore, the effect of the difference in the gender distribution.
(5). If the distributions of age, field, and gender were identical in 1962 and 1992, and only the distribution of agefield-gender-specific mean TTD's varied, as it did, then the mean TTD's for 1962

only two factors (age and gender) instead of the three factors (age, gender, and field).
CONCLUSIONS
By using the data for the Ph.D.-year cohorts, I show that during the 30-year period 1962-1992 the crude mean TTD's increased by 23.9, 20.7, 15.3, 21.6, 20.8, 20.2, 30.0, and 20.3 per cents, respectively, in all fields together, the physical sciences, engineering, life sciences, social sciences, humanities, education, and in the professional/other. When the mean TTD's are standardized by age and gender (and by age, field, and gender in the case of all fields), these percentages come down to 5.5, 4.4, 6.1, 6.4, 3.7, 3.2, 8.1, and 5.4, respectively. Again, in all fields and in seven individual areas, respectively, 74.8, 76.8, 58.7, 68.4, 80.7, 83.0,
70.3, and 71.6 per cents of the total difference between the crude mean TTD's in

1962 and 1992 can be attributed to the differences in the factors age and gender (age, field, and gender in the case of all fields), and predominantly age. The field of engineering in 1992 is the only place where women, on the average, took less time than men to earn a Ph.D. (Table 1). This phenomenon translates into a negative gender effect for engineering in Table 2.
As we noted earlier, total time-todegree (TTD) measures the number of years elapsed between receipt of the baccalaureate and the Ph.D. Many students do not spend this entire period of time in graduate school in active pursuit of the advanced degree. They may choose to do "other things" for a period of time such as working, serving in the Peace Corps, serving in the military, raising children, establishing a spouse in a career, etc. If the percentage of time spent in doing other things during TTD shows an increasing trend over the years, then the use

of TTD as a measure of time spent on active pursuit of the degree may give the false impression that students are taking increasingly more time to complete their degrees once they enroll in the program.
Obviously, the research on this issue would be more precise in terms of registered time-to-degree (RTD) which gauges the amount of time an individual was actually enrolled in graduate school, including master's degrees and enrollment in nondegree programs (Ries and Thurgood, 1993). If, during 1962-1992, for example, RTD remained unchanged but TTD increased, that finding would clearly indicate that this increase in TTD was solely due to students' spending increasingly more time in non-academic activities following the baccalaureate. However, as we see in Table 3, both median RTD and median TTD increased during 1962-1992 in each and every field of study. As a matter of fact, the per cent increase in RTD was higher than that in TTD during this period for all fields together and for individual fields except for education. Even in terms of absolute increase, both median RTD and median TTD for all fields together showed the same increase of 1.7 years during 1962-1992. Therefore, there has been a significant increase in the average time to earn a Ph.D. in recent years.
How do we interpret this increase? There are primarily two reasons why it is taking more time in recent years to earn a doctorate, and both these reasons are demographic in nature. Traditionally, those

individuals who complete their degrees at older ages take more time to do so compared to younger Ph.D. recipients. However, at the same time, the percentage of Ph.D. recipients at older ages has substantially increased in recent years. These two phenomena together are pushing the mean TTD upward, as happened during 1962-1992. Likewise, traditionally, women take more time than men to complete their Ph.D.'s, but the percentage of women among the Ph.D. recipients in a year has shown significant increase over time. Again, these two factors together are responsible for inflating the mean TTD, as happened during 1962-1992.
Thus, about 75 per cent of the actual increase in mean TTD can be attributed to the change in the age-sex structure of Ph.D. recipients during 1962-1992. Therefore, the "real" increase in mean TTD is only about 25 per cent of what the difference of the overall mean TTD's for 1962 and 1992 indicates. In other words, the real increase is 0.61 year (instead of 2.42 years), i.e., about 7 months over a thirty-year period. This increase does not seem to be so alarming that students would be discouraged from pursuing doctoral programs.
