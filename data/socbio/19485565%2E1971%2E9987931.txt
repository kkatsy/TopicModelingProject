In a recent article, Kunz and Brinkerhoff (1969) postulate that there exists a general belief that the rate of childlessness is higher among white than among nonwhite couples.1 They argue that in fact childlessness is considerably higher among nonwhite populations. In support of their argument, Kunz and Brinkerhoff ignore previous research in this area (Grabill and Glick, 1959) and refer to 1960 American census data concerning white and nonwhite wives, married once with husband present, ages 35-54.
Kunz and Brinkerhoff attempt to introduce controls for some of the variables which may affect their data. They break the data down by age cohorts (comparing first marriage at 14 to 21 with first marriage at 22 or older) and by husband's education. Taking these controls into ac-
1 Kunz and Brinkerhoff provide no evidence for the existence of their postulated belief in the lower childlessness of nonwhites, other than to indicate that such is the perception of a sample of university undergraduates. Certainly such a position would not be endorsed by demographers or sociologists concerned with the relationship of race and fertility. All such "experts" who have considered the phenomenon of childlessness at all have commented upon its higher incidence among nonwhites. See, for example, Grabill and Glick, 1959; Mitra, 1966; Campbell, 1966.

count, the data still support the essential message of their article, namely that: "a greater proportion of the nonwhite couples are childless than are the white couples" (Kunz and Brinkerhoff, 1969, p. 719).
The present article will be concerned with three questions not dealt with in Kunz and Brinkerhoff's discussion. First, how does the incidence of childlessness among whites and nonwhites vary among age cohorts? Second, what causal factors may have contributed to the differential childlessness? Third, what trends may be anticipated in the future?
CHILDLESSNESS AND AGE COHORTS
Kunz and Brinkerhoff do not explain why they choose to limit their attention to women in the 35-54 age group, other than to suggest that these women would have completed their childbearing "for the most part." The use of completed family size as an index of fertility is a common demographic convention and is justified by the rationale that, until the completion of the menopause at the age of about fortyfive or forty-nine, a woman can always have more children. What seems to have escaped Kunz and Brinkerhoff is the ob-

vious fact that shecannot have ¡ewerand that when looking for indices of childlessness, it is equally logical to examine the fertility behavior of all women evermarried. When rates of childlessness among younger women are also considered, it becomes apparent that the conclusions of Kunz and Brinkerhoff cannot be generalized to all cohorts and that if present trends continue the rates of

white childlessness may exceed those for nonwhites.
The 1960 American census includes data on the number of children ever born to women married once, husband present, based on a 5% sample. The relative proportion of childlessness for whites andnonwhites is shown in Figure 1. Although whites generally have a lower incidence of childlessness than nonwhites, for the

younger categories, ages 15-24, the incidence is actually higher and for the ages 25-29, the difference is relatively small.
The rate of childlessness is significantly affected by the age at first marriage and by marriage duration. When controls are introduced for these variables, the incidence of childlessness is again different than would be expected on the basis of Kunz and Brinkerhoff's conclusions. At all ages, among couples who have been married for a year or less, the proportion of childlessness is much higher among white than nonwhite couples (Table 1). When marriages of two years or less are considered, the difference is still large and in the same direction (Figure 2).
In marriages of from three to five years

of the nonwhites remained childless. Since it is quite possible that some of these childless wives will have at least one child during the twenty-five years remaining before the end of their childbearing period, we could expect the lifetime rate of childlessness to approach 3 or 4%? Only in marriages of eleven to fifteen years' duration, with wives 35 years of age or older, do we find the high rates of childlessness and the consistent variations along racial lines suggested by Kunz and Brinkerhoff (Figure 5).

the relationship of color and childlessness is inconsistent; nonwhites have lower rates in the 20-24 age group, and only slightly higher rates for teenagers and women in their late twenties (Figure 3 ) . In marriages of from six to ten years' duration, young nonwhites are only slightly more apt to be childless than young whites (Figure 4).

2 These rates of childlessness are exceedingly low. For example, the 1961 Canadian census provides data on rural-farm women in Quebec who were married between the ages of 15 to 19. This population is predominantly Roman Catholic, and the incidence of voluntary childlessness, and the effective use of birth control and/or abortion to prevent all births can be assumed to be minimal. Even among such an extreme population, the rate of childlessness for women 20-24 years was 10%. The average rate for women 45 years and older was 2.93%.

or subfecundity of one or both of the marital pair.
Involuntary childlessness is usually used to refer to sterility or to subfecundity. Sterility may be of one of two kinds: physiological, due to some specific physical

problem caused by genetic defect, traumatic injury, or disease; or psychosomatic, due to some psychological factors of tension, stress or strain which, in a process not yet clearly understood, affect the ability to reproduce. Voluntary childlessness is usually used to refer to the decision not to have children, and to a preference for the childless state.
Specific cases, however, may be very difficult to classify. For example, a couple may claim to be voluntarily childless and use elaborate birth control techniques to prevent conception even though, ironically enough, they are unknowingly sterile. It is possible that some of the psychological factors which lead to a preference for the childless state may be the same factors which lead to psychosomatic sterility. Conversely, it is always possible that the inability to conceive leads to the effective rationalization that conception was not desirable in any case. Sterility, except in the case of surgical alteration of the reproductive organs, is not usually an absolutely definite state, but refers to relative degrees of subfecundity. A number of women who do not conceive could be made fertile through relatively simple medical techniques. If medical facilities are available, and they choose to do nothing about their subfecundity, they are in a sense childless by choice.
In spite of the difficulty in making precise distinctions between these two types, there is some consensus in the literature that "Voluntary childlessness is virtually extinct . . . and . . . fecundity impairments are now the chief cause of childlessness" (Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966, p. 163; Population Reference Bureau, 1966, p. 279). This represents a change from the recent past. During the 1940's it was estimated that nearly onefifth of all white couples remained childless and that as many as one-half of these
