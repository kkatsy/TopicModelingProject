ABSTRACT: This paper reports on a study of infant and child mortality in the Republic of Korea, a country known for a strong son preference, using the 1974 World Fertility Survey data. When the age-specific probabilities of dying for ages zero to five are compared for male and female children, an unusual pattern of relatively high female mortality is observed. The higher female mortality is more pronounced during childhood than during infancy. Multivariate analysis of life tables, using a hazard model, shows that covariates influencing the mortality at young ages differ for male and female children and suggests that male and female children receive unequal care by their parents. The analysis also reveals different patterns of interaction between infant and child mortality and mother's fertility control behavior depending on the sex of the child.

while the model life tables show higher male mortality. Thisfindingimplies that female children Korea suffer much higher mortality than expected by the overall level of mortality. Again, the differentials in the sex ratios of mortality are greater for infants born in the earlier period. If the sex differentials of mortality were due to son preference attitudes, it can be postulated that these attitudes are diminishing in the more recent time.
The regional model life tables are constructed from historical life tables. Comparisons with more recent life tables are made in Table 2. The male and female nqx values for the age groups 0-1 and 1-5 from life tables with comparable infant mortality rates for males are shown along with the sex ratios of mortality. In these life tables, as in the model life tables, male mortality is generally higher than female mortality in both age groups, and the age difference is greater in the younger age group. Exceptions are found in countries well known for the low status they give to women or for having a strong son preference, namely, Jordan, Kuwait, and Hong Kong. The sex ratios of infant and

child mortality for Korea, regional model life tables, and other populations in Tables 1 and 2 are also shown in Figures 1 and 2.
MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
Now we examine the covariates of infant and child mortality. The hazard model2 of life tables is used for this purpose. The hazard model estimates the multiplicative effects of covariates on the age-specific force of mortality in a multivariate mode. In the simplest form, all covariates remain unchanged at all ages, and the effects of covariates do not depend on the age. This model is referred to as the proportional hazards model. A more general form of the hazard model can be specified. The covariates may take different values at different ages. For example, breastfeeding of an infant may take a value of one before weaning and a value of zero after wean-
2The hazard model for life table analysis is an extension of the proportional hazards model by Cox (1972). Trussell and Hammerslough (1983) give an excellent exposition of the method for demographers, and Trussell and Menken (1984) summarize strengths and weaknesses of the model.

ing. Covariates of this type are called time-varying covariates. Some covariates mayremain unchanged at all ages, but their effects may change depending on the age. For example, low birth weight may have a very strong effect on the survival of an infant during-the first few days of life but a lesser effect at older ages. This type of covariate is called a time-dependent effect covariate. Some covariates maybe both timevarying and have time-dependent effect.
In this paper, theanalysis isdone separately for male and female infants to determine ifsome covariates affect mortality differently for the two sexes. An

alternative approach would be to treat sex as a dummy variable andto include interaction terms between sex and other covariates. For the interaction between sex and age, sex would be treated asa time-dependent effect covariate. The approach used here issimpler but it does not estimate the effect of sex directly. The analysis is done separately for firstorder births and higher-order births, because some important covariates suchas birth interval and experience of previous infant deaths are not defined for the births of order one.
The list of covariates considered, together with their mean values, aregiven in Table 3, and Table 4 shows correla-

tion coefficients among the covariates. The correlation coefficients are shown only for both sexes because they differ little by sex.
The socioeconomic covariates included are mother's residence at the time of the survey andmother's levelof education. Residence (RES) iscoded as urban (= 1) and rural (= 0). Mother's education is represented bytwo dummy variables allowing for three levels: no formal education (LED= 1, HED= 0), elementary level (LED = 0, HED = 0),and higher level (LED = 0, HED = 1).
The covariate IACP indicates mother's fertility control behavior. It iscoded

as oneif the mother has hadan induced abortion or used anycontraceptivesbefore thesurvey, andzero otherwise.
The following three covariates, AGPR, INT1,and INT2 are fertility variables. The covariate AGPR indicates whether maternal age wasexceptionally young relative to the woman's parity at thetime of birth of each infant in the analysis. The coding is dichotomous: 1 if parity isrelatively high for the maternal age, and 0otherwise. The coding was determined by examining the infant mortality for births cross-classified by maternal ageandparity. Thefollowing combinations of parity and maternal age are coded as one: Parity 1 and ma-

who stopped breastfeeding because of illness and died soon after will have breastfeeding code equal to one (sufficient) . Infants who never began breastfeeding because of illness have breastfeeding code equal to zero. If there are many such infants our estimate of breastfeeding effect will be exaggerated. For infants who were less than twelve months of age and surviving at the time of survey, sufficient breastfeeding code was assigned if the infant was currently breastfeeding or had been breastfeeding up to four weeks prior to the survey. As the mean values show, this is a very skewed variable, with more than 80 per cent of infants having been breastfed sufficiently.
The covariate BY indicates year of birth and is treated as an interval variable.
The mean values of the covariates are similar for male and female children with the following exceptions. The mean value of the fertility control variable IACP is larger for male children, showing that women who have some male children are more likely to have used contraceptive methods or induced abortion. Among the births of order one, the mean value of the succeeding birth interval INT2 is larger for females, implying a shorter average birth interval following a female first birth. For births of higher order, the mean values of succeeding birth interval do not differ much. It is interesting to note that Park's analysis of the same data shows the proportion of women progressing to a next birth to be much higher after a female birth (Park, 1983).
RESULTS
The hazard model effects of covariates an infant and child mortality are es-

timated separately by sex and birth order of children. The age at death was coded in number of weeks, and the effects of all covariates are assumed to be constant within the age intervals 0 to 12 months (infant mortality) and 1 to 5 years (child mortality) but different across the two age intervals.
The upper panel of Table 5 shows the cumulative hazard of dying during infancy and early childhood for infants born in 1960-74 by sex and birth order after adjusting for the effects of covariates. It shows that infant mortality is higher for births of order one and for males. Child mortality shows the opposite pattern. It is lower for births of order one and for males. The first order births may be biologically weaker and thus suffer higher mortality during the first year of life when biological factors are important determinants of mortality. However, the first-order children are likely to receive more attention and better health care and thus have lower mortality during the early childhood when the environmental factors are important determinants of mortality. Similar arguments may apply to male infants. They are biologically weaker but are cared for better in Korea where the male children are desired more than the female children.
Figure 3 compares adjusted infant and child mortality by sex for each age and birth order group with the model life table mortality by sex. For each age group, the North and West regional model life tables with matching male mortality are chosen and the corresponding female mortality from the model life tables are shown by dotted lines along with observed female mortality indicated by the solid lines. In each of the age and birth order group, the Korean data show excess female mortal-

nomic variables (RES, LED, andHED) on infant and child mortality are weak. Among twelve coefficients, only two are statistically significant. Mother's education of more than elementary level lowers both infant and child mortality of females significantly.
It is interesting to see that the fertility control variable is a significant covariate for male infant mortality but not for female infant mortality. It is likely that women who have not experienced infant deaths will use contraceptive methods and induced abortion more often than women who have experienced male infant deaths. In Korea, most women use contraceptive methods and induced abortion after having achieved

the desired family size (Pebley et al., 1985). Our rinding suggests that the decision to limit family size depends on the family's experience of male infant deaths. Earlier study on family building in Korea has found that the decision to have more children is influenced by whether the family already has borne a male child (Park, 1983).
Neither of the fertility variables (AGPR and INT2) is statistically significant. For the births of order one, the maternal age and the length of succeeding birth interval do not affect the survival of the child before age 5. Note that the births of order one have higher infant mortality than other births for both sexes.

Breastfeeding is a statistically significant covariate for both infant and child mortality and for both sexes.
Two of the four coefficients for the time of birth are statistically significant. Although the KNFS data is thought to have excellent pregnancy history data, it is unlikely that the reporting is complete. Because first-order births that did not survive are more likely to be omitted from the pregnancy history, the coefficients for time of birth may be an underestimate of the true value, and the true time trends of infant and child mortality may be larger than those implied by the coefficients.
BIRTH ORDER > 1
For the births of order greater than one, socioeconomic variables have even less effect on infant and child mortality; only one of the twelve coefficients is statistically significant. Urban residence of mother lowers female infant mortality.
Again, the fertility control variable IACP is statistically significant for males only, and the same argument as given for first-order births may apply.
The relatively young maternal age for parity (AGPR) raises male child mortality significantly. Why this covariate shows different effects on children of different sex and at different ages is not clear.
The preceding birth interval (INT1) is a statistically significant covariate for male and female infant mortality, and for female child mortality. The short birth interval may affect mortality in two ways. First, the short birth intervals may be related to premature births and lower birth weights, resulting in higher infant mortality. Second, short birth interval may affect mortality by way of competition for resources, which may result in higher child mortality. However, in the

Korean data, the male child mortality is not affected by a shorter preceding birth interval. The difference may be explained by child-caring behavior that prefers male children. Male children may receive better allocation of resources and health care even in the presence of other competing children close in ages, thus making the effect of preceding birth interval variable statistically insignificant. A maternal and child health care project in a rural area in Korea reports that after three years of education on child health care with increased number of health care personnel and clinics, the visits to child health care clinics increased but disproportionately more for male children. It reports that during last twelve months of the project, 85 per cent of the male children of age under five visited the health clinics compared to the 50 per cent of the female children (Kim, 1979).
The succeeding birth interval (INT2) is a statistically significant covariate for child mortality for both sexes and not significant for infant mortality for either sex. The children who experience a birth of another child in the family at very young ages may have less chance of survival due to competition for mother's attention and resources. And because these factors are environmental, the child mortality is affected significantly while infant mortality is not. It seems contradictory that the succeeding birth interval is a significant factor for male child mortality but the preceding birth interval is not. It may be that women with strong son preference attitudes may deliberately lengthen the interval following the birth of a male child, leaving the women who are less likely to exercise preferential care of male children subject to short succeeding birth intervals. This argument is partly supported

by the smaller mean value of the succeeding birth interval for male children in Table 3.
The experience of infant death (INFD) by an older sibling is a statistically significant covariate for infant deaths for both sexes, but not for child mortality. The experience of infant death may be considered as a proxy for the unmeasured tendency of women to give births to children with less favorable conditions for survival. Thisfinding is consistent with the observations that infant mortality is due more to the biological factors, and child mortality is due more to environmental factors.
The breastfeeding variable is statistically significant three out of four times. Sufficient breastfeeding lowers infant mortality of both sexes, and male child mortality significantly. A study on breastfeeding in Korea using the same KNFS data shows that for the children born during the four-year period before the survey, the sex of the child has a weak but significant effect on the decision of Korean women to breastfeed (Nemeth, 1981). These findings together imply that the male infant and child mortality would be lower than the female mortality after adjustments are made for other factors.
The coefficients for the covariate indicating year of birth (BY) are larger for female child mortality, implying that the inequality for female children was greater in the past.

the children born in the more distant
past.
The hazard model analysis of covari-
ates of infant and child mortality show
the following:
1. Mortality at age zero is higher for male and female infants (a) if mother experienced previous infant death, (b) if they receive insufficient breastfeeding, (c) if they are born less than two years after the previous birth, (d) and if their birth order is one.
2. For male infants, mother's experience of induced abortions or use of contraceptive methods is associated with lower infant mortality.
3. For births of order one, urban residence and mother's higher education is associated with lower female infant mortality.
1. Mortality between ages one and five is higher for male and female children (a) if they receive insufficient breastfeeding. (b) and if they have older siblings and are followed by another birth in less than two years.
2. For male children of higher birth order, child mortality is higher if maternal age was unusually young for the birth order.
3. For male children of higher birth order, child mortality is lower if mother had experienced induced abortion or had used contraceptive methods.
4. Female child mortality is higher for those who were born less than two years after the previous birth. The preceding birth interval does not have significant effect on the male child mortality.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Compared to most other populations, Korean female children experience excess mortality before agefive,especially between ages one and five. The excess mortality is larger for the children of birth order greater than one and for

Besides the two strong covariates, namely, the previous experience of infant death and breastfeeding, the fertility variables show stronger association with infant and child mortality than the socioeconomic variables, this finding suggests that promotion of family plan-
