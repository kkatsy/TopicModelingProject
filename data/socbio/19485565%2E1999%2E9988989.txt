ABSTRACT: This study examines trends in proximate determinants of fertility in Zimbabwe and Kenya. Findings from the four Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in these countries show that the dramatic fall in fertility in these countries is consistent with the underlying trends in the most important proximate determinants of fertility. In Zimbabwe, contraceptive use far exceeds other proximate determinants in influencing fertility levels and trends. The results show that the fertility inhibiting effects of contraception are more important than the effects of postpartum infecundability, marriage patterns, or sterility. The results also show that contraceptive use has its greatest suppressing effects in the middle and younger age groups. However, in Kenya, the dominant fertility inhibiting effect is postpartum infecundability, with contraception coming in second.

The dramatic decline in fertility in Zimbabwe and Kenya in the last few years has been well documented and has prompted both scholars and policymakers to ask why the decline has occurred. Besides the well-known correlates of fertility decline, such as high levels of education, low levels of infant and child mortality, and reasonably sound economies, a strong family planning program which has resulted in substantial contraceptive use in these countries is also a popular explanation (Kirk and Pillet, 1998; Caldwell et al., 1992). In Zimbabwe, use of modern contraceptives among married women has steadily increased from 27 per cent in 1984 to 36 per cent in 1988, and then to 42 per cent in 1994 (CSO and Macro International Inc., 1995). In Kenya, use of modern methods rose from 11 per cent in 1977-78 to 14.1 per cent in 1984, to 24.1 per cent in 1989, and peaked at an all-

time high of 34 per cent in 1993 (National Council for Population and Development, 1994). A series of national surveys conducted in Kenya show that the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 8.1 births per woman in the mid-1970's (Kenya Fertility Survey) to 7.7 in 1984 (Kenya CPS) and then to 6.7 and 5.4 in 1989 and 1993 (Kenya DHS I and II, respectively). In Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Reproductive and Health Survey of 1984 estimated a TFR of 6.5, and two rounds of DHS surveys conducted in 1988-89 and 1994 yielded TFR's of 5.4 and 4.3, respectively. In both countries, it appears that the fertility decline gathered momentum beginning in the early 1980's.
The fertility decline that has taken place in Zimbabwe and Kenya makes these countries interesting case studies for examining the role of the proximate determinants of fertility in sub-Saharan

Africa. This study will identify the factors which have had the greatest impact on fertility. For instance, is the sharp fall in total fertility in these countries consistent with the underlying trends in the most important proximate determinants of fertility, like a rise in contraceptive use and postponement of marriage? In addition, this paper offers us the opportunity to identify important sign posts which point toward a sustained fertility decline in these countries. According to van de Walle and Foster (1990, p. 9), if one wishes to identify the beginning of a sustained decline in completed family size, distinct from mere short-term fluctuations in fertility or reporting errors, then one should examine a variety of indicators for evidence. In particular, one should look for (1) a conclusive drop in the level of fertility using comparable surveys; (2) a significant rise in the use of efficient contraceptives, particularly among age groups experiencing fertility decline; and (3) a conclusive drop in fertility intentions.
Historical studies of fertility transition have shown that as societies begin to undergo the transformation from natural to deliberately controlled fertility, significant changes in the overall levels of total natural marital fertility (TN), total marital fertility (TM) and total fertility (TFR) begin to occur. Such changes can be traced to one or several proximate factors such as an increase in contraceptive use for stopping and spacing purposes, a rise in age at first marriage, a decline in the proportion married, prolonged breast-feeding, and increased induced abortion. Unfortunately, because of data limitation, it is not always possible to examine changes associated with these proximate determinants of fertility over time. In the cases of Kenya and Zimbabwe, however, we are

able to examine the relative changes over time in the effects of the proximate determinants of fertility because the two rounds of DHS surveys conducted in each country provide us with the necessary data. However, the analysis is restricted to the time period 1988-1994.
This study focuses on three of the four primary proximate determinants that Bongaarts (1982) and Bongaarts and Potter (1983) identify as having a significant effect on fertility, namely, marriage patterns, contraceptive use, and postpartum infecundability. A fourth proximate factor, primary sterility, will also be analyzed. Aside from the main determinants named above, Bongaarts and Potter (1983) include permanent sterility, frequency of intercourse, and spontaneous intrauterine mortality as factors of secondary importance. Fertility levels are not very sensitive to changes associated with these later proximate determinants because they do not vary much across populations. In this study, the effect of induced abortion is not examined because induced abortion has a negligible effect on fertility levels and because of rare and unreliable statistics for induced abortions in Zimbabwe and Kenya or anywhere else in sub-Saharan Africa (Bongaarts et al., 1984). I will therefore study primary sterility instead. Because of the well-established pattern of pathological sterility in certain countries like Cameroon, Congo, and the Central African Republic, and because the levels of sterility vary markedly between these countries and other parts of the subcontinent, this proximate determinant is therefore a potentially important fertility inhibitor (Page, 1988; Romaniuk, 1968; Frank, 1983; Larsen and Menken, 1989).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data for this analysis are drawn from the 1988-89 and 1994 Zimbabwe DHS and the 1988 and 1993 Kenya DHS. The samples for these four surveys were national in scope. By using these four data sets, we will be able to examine how the four proximate determinants influenced fertility levels during the first round of DHS surveys and compare these results to the effects in the second round of DHS surveys. This comparison will allow us to illustrate the different effects of each factor on fertility over time in each country.
In order to quantify the effects of each proximate factor on fertility, Bongaarts developed the following formula:
TFR =TF*Cm*Cc* Ci *Ip [1]
In the original model, Bongaarts has an index of induced abortion (Ca) instead of Ip, the index of sterility. The calculation of Ip is based on a 3 per cent standard rate of childlessness in developing countries that was established by Frank (1983) and Bongaarts et al. (1984). This rate refers to the lowest level of natural fertility (3 per cent), which occurs in women's early 20's. Hence, this figure provides us with the lowest proportion of women one would expect to be childless until menopause in societies with universal marriage. Jolly and Gribble (1993) note additionally that if the rate of childlessness exceeds 3 per cent, Ip will have a value less than 1, indicating that it reduces fertility. However, if less than 3 per cent of women age 40-49 are childless, Ip will have a value greater than 1. If the last condition holds, it indicates that levels of primary sterility will be lower than

would be expected in a developing country. The index of sterility is to be estimated as

Ip =

7.63-0.11*,? 7.3

[2]

where s is the proportion of women aged 40-49 who have never had any children. The lower age limit for probable levels of, infertility is set at 40 in sub-Saharan Africa since it is widely assumed that most women in sub-Saharan African fertility regimes would have had their first birth by the time they turn 40 years (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983; Bongaarts et al., 1984). This contention is based on the observation that at older ages, most women tend to have irregular and infrequent ovulation which is coupled by the aging of the reproductive system and increasingly lower frequencies of intercourse.
Cm is the index of marriage which is intended to measure the effect on fertility of the proportion of women in a sexual union. The effect of marriage on fertility is captured as the ratio of the average number of children a woman bears throughout her life to the number she would have if she first entered union at age 15 and stayed in that union until she reached menopause. Cm equals 1 if all women of reproductive age are in union and 0 when none are in union. However, it is important to note that the value of Cm can be greater than 1 if there are many births that occur outside union. For example, the value of Cm is likely to be greater than 1 in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa since an appreciable proportion of births occur to unmarried women (Bongaarts et al., 1984; Jolly and Gribble, 1993). If these nonmarital births are excluded in

Vol. 46, No. 1-2

the calculation of Cm, the TFR would be underestimated while the total marital fertility rate would be accurately estimated. On the other hand, the total marital fertility rate would be inflated if these nonmarital births are included, thereby giving a false impression that marriage patterns reduce fertility by a larger fraction than they actually do. To avoid this problem and to maintain a consistent definition for the other variables in Bongaarts' model, Jolly and Gribble (1993) propose the addition of another variable, Mo. This new variable captures the effect on total fertility of nonmarital births. It relates total fertility calculated by using all births to total fertility calculated by using births only to women in marriage. Cm*, a modified version of Cm, captures the effect on total fertility of the specific observed union pattern under the assumption that no births occur outside marriage. The product of Mo and Cm* is Cm, which captures Bongaarts' definition of the effects of marriage patterns on fertility. The index of marriage is to be calculated as follows:
CM = total fertility rate (TFR) [3] total maritalfertility rate (TMFR)
where TFR is the average number of children that would be born to a cohort of girl babies who survive to the end of their reproductive period and are subject at each age to the observed age-specific rates of bearing children and TMFR is the average total number of births a woman in union from age 15 to 49 would have at current age-specific marital fertility rates. The total marital fertility rate is estimated for women currently in union. The two fertility rates are estimated for the 5 years prior to the survey.

Measured births outside marriage are calculated as

Mo =

TFR TUFR

[4]

where TUFR is the sum of the age-specific fertility rates of women in union (ASUFR) which is estimated as follows:

ASUFR=

marital births at age i
mid-year population of women aged i

[5]

The adjusted index of marriage is calculated as

Cm*

=

TUFR TMFR.

[6]

The estimation of TUFR is complicated by the fact that the DHS data for Zimbabwe and Kenya do not have complete marriage histories, making it impossible to estimate lengths of marital disruption. To overcome this problem, Jolly and Gribble suggest that we assume that there is no marital disruption from the date of first union if the woman is still married at the time of the survey. This assumption is based on the fact that most marital disruptions in sub-Saharan Africa are fairly short since most women remarry quickly; hence they do not spend a lot of time without being exposed to the risk of getting pregnant (Bongaarts et al., 1984; Mhloyi, 1988). Thus, if there are any births that occur during a period of marital disruption, there will not be a serious overestimation of the TUFR. On the other hand, the effect of childbearing outside union on fertility (Mo) can be estimated if we assume that births to women whose status at the time of the survey is divorced or widowed occurred outside,

86

and this assumption also leads to an underestimation of TUFR.
The index of contraception, Cc, measures the effect of contraception on the risk of conception. The index equals 1 if no form of contraception is used and 0 if all fecund women use modern methods that are 100 per cent effective. This index will be calculated as follows:

Cc = 1 - 1.08 * u * e

[7]

where u is the current contraceptive use prevalence rate among women in sexual union and e is the average use-effectiveness of contraception which is calculated as the weighted average of the following methodspecific use-effectiveness levels:

Contraceptive method

Use-effectiveness rate (e)

Pill 0.90

IUD 0.95

Sterilization

1.00

Other modern methods

0.70

Traditional methods

0.30

These use-effectiveness levels are adopted from Bongaarts and Potter (1983). These weights are, in effect, equal to the proportion of women using a given method. Bongaarts and Potter introduced a coefficient of 1.08 to Equation 7 to adjust for the fact that if women know that they are sterile, they will not use any form of contraception. In other words, the 1.08 coefficient adjusts for the proportion of women who are fecund, a phenomenon which varies with age.
The index of postpartum infecundability, Ci, measures the effects of postpartum amenorrhea and abstinence on fertility. The index equals 1 in the absence of lactation and postpartum abstinence and

0 when infecundability is permanent. The index of postpartum infecundability is calculated as

20
18.5 + i

[8]

where / is the average number of months of postpartum infecundability for currently married women, which is estimated as the number of mothers either amenorrheic or abstaining at the time of the survey (prevalence) divided by the mean number of births per month over the last three years (incidence). Bongaarts and Potter contend that in the absence of breast-feeding and sexual abstinence, the four components of a typical birth interval would add up to 20 months, made up of the following components: postpartum anovulation (1.5 months), the waiting time to conception (7.5 months), spontaneous intrauterine mortality (2 months), and the average length of a full-term pregnancy (9 months). However, the average length of a birth interval can be shortened to 18.5 months in the presence of breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence.
This study will provide estimates of these proximate determinants across age groups for Kenya and Zimbabwe using the four DHS surveys. Age-specific estimates will allow us to identify where the greatest reductive effects of each proximate determinant have occurred.

mate determinants and the biological maximum level of fertility (TFR = TF*Cm*Cc*Ci*Ip). The total fecundity rate (TF) has been observed to vary from 13 to 17 births per woman, with an average of about 15.3 (Bongaarts, 1982).
Table 1 presents the estimates of the proximate determinants derived from the 1988 and 1994 Zimbabwe DHS surveys while Table 2 presents similar results for Kenya for the years 1988 and 1993. These estimates for various age groups of the population allow one to examine how changes in the levels of fertility over time in a population are caused by changes in one or more proximate determinants.
MARRIAGE
A comparison of the estimates for Zimbabwe and Kenya reveals that at the national level, the fertility-inhibiting effect of marriage increased between 1988-94 and 1988-93. In Zimbabwe, Cm was 0.81 in 1988 and 0.79 in 1994, and in Kenya, Cm also dropped from 0.86 to 0.83 between 1988 and 1993. Similar changes are also noted for the adjusted index of marriage, Cm*. In Zimbabwe the values for Cm* are 0.71 (ZDHS-1) and 0.68 (ZDHS-II), while in Kenya, the values are 0.72 (KDHS-1) and 0.67 (KDHS-II). These indexes imply that if childbearing was confined to marital unions and if all women marry and stay married between the ages 15-49, the TFR would have increased by 29 per cent and 32 per cent in 1988 and 1994 in Zimbabwe. In Kenya the TFR would have increased by 28 per cent and 33 per cent in 1988 and 1993, respectively. On the other, hand, a comparison of the effects of marital patterns by age shows that in both countries, the greatest fertility reducing effect of marriage patterns (both Cm and

Cm*) is found at the younger ages (15-19 and 20-24), and the effect is low at the middle and older ages where most women are expected to be in some kind of marital or sexual union.
A look at the effect of births outside union reveals an interesting trend in both countries. At the national level, the TFR in Zimbabwe was 14 per cent higher in 1988 than it would have been if all childbearing was confined to the institution of marriage. By 1994, the effect of Mo was 1.16, implying that the TFR would have been 16 per cent lower than it would have been if only births in union were used instead of using all births regardless of marital status. In Kenya, a similar trend is also observed. In 1988 the TFR was 19 per cent higher that it would have been if all childbearing was a privilege enjoyed by women in unions only. By 1993, the TFR had increased by 24 per cent. What this finding seems to suggest is that more and more women are having children outside marriage, a transformation which normally accompanies change in the institution of the family as it relates to societal approval (expectations) of marital fertility as opposed to nonmarital fertility. In most parts of sub-Saharan Africa, childbearing is sanctioned mostly through marriage.
A look at the age groups offers us some important clues as to where these increases in non-marital births have been occurring. It is very clear from the surveys in both countries that the increase in nonmarital fertility occurred across all age groups. However, the biggest effects of these non-marital births to total fertility can be noted for women aged 15-19 (which is a reflection of increased teenage pregnancy and not necessarily teen marital fertility) and age 20-24.

of the large Mo values we have in Zimbabwe and Kenya, fairly substantial variations are noted when we compare Cm* and Cm. This finding means that when one estimates the fertility inhibiting effect of union patterns using births in union only, the potential to underestimate the overall effect of Cm on total fertility is huge. For example, in Zimbabwe Cm is 0.81 as compared to a Cm* value of 0.71 (1988), and in 1994 Cm was 0.79 as compared to a Cm* value of 0.68. In Kenya, Cm was 0.86 versus a Cm* value of 0.72 in 1988, and by 1993 these two indexes had dropped to 0.83 and 0.67, respectively. Thus, in both countries the lower values of Cm* as compared to Cm suggest that union patterns have a fairly large effect in reducing fertility. A rise in age at marriage and an increase in the number of women not in union are the primary causes for the lower Cm's.
CONTRACEPTION
Analysis of change associated with contraceptive use helps us examine in some limited way whether any increase in the fertility-inhibiting effects of contraception constitute evidence of what Coale (1973) postulated as the necessary conditions for a fertility decline to start: (1) fertility is within the calculus of conscious choice; (2) lower fertility is seen as advantageous; and (3) effective means of birth control are readily available and couples are willing to use them. The idea of using contraception to achieve certain family targets also ties in nicely with van de Walle's (1992) concept of numeracy.
The DHS surveys done in Zimbabwe and Kenya have shown that women in these countries have easy access to means of limiting their fertility (contraception) and that they are using these contracep-

tives either to space or limit births unlike women in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The motivation to limit family size has been growing and this has to do with the increasing costs of raising and educating children and the need to improve women's health (Kelley and Nobbe, 1990; Jolly and Gribble, 1993; Mhloyi, 1994). In addition, large numbers of women in these societies seem to understand the concept of numeracy since the majority of them can express the number of children they desire to have in terms of numbers. In other words, women in these two societies have the frame of mind and a clear numerical standard that gives them the leverage necessary to make "sense of small families and the means to obtain them" (van de Walle, 1992, p. 496). The fact that more and more women in these societies can express the number of children they would like to have, coupled with the fact that women in places like Kenya have greater control of their reproductive behavior and preferences than their husbands, can be interpreted as evidence of the fact that fertility is now within the calculus of conscious choice (Ezeh, 1993). For instance, of the women who gave numeric responses to questions on ideal family size (93 per cent and 99 per cent in ZDHS-I and ZDHS-II, respectively, and 96 per cent and 94 per cent in KDHS-I and KDHS-II, respectively), the average ideal number of children dropped from 4.9 to 4.4 between 1988 and 1994 in Zimbabwe, and in Kenya it declined from 4.4 in 1988 to 3.7 in 1993 (CSO and Macro International, Inc., 1995; National Council for Population, 1994). It can also be argued that numeracy about children can lead to effective spacing of births, which could lead to declines in fertility.

This effect is conceivable if numeracy can help women set desired or ideal family size and use efficient contraceptives to attain that size.
Table 1 clearly shows that, at the national level, contraception has the largest fertility inhibitive effect in Zimbabwe when compared to the other three proximate factors. Between 1988 and 1994, the index of contraception increased in strength from 0.63 to 0.58. On the other hand, in Kenya contraception is not as effective in limiting fertility when compared to the effects of postpartum infecundability. Between 1988 and 1993, the index values of contraception dropped from 0.80 to 0.73. A comparison of the two countries shows that contraception is playing a bigger role in the fertility transition in Zimbabwe. It is surprising to note that the fertility-inhibiting effect of Ci observed for women aged 15-19 in Zimbabwe in 1988 was even stronger than that for any age group of women in Kenya in 1988. In fact, the national Cc index was higher (weaker) in Kenya than the Cc index value at age 15--19 in Zimbabwe in either 1988 or 1994.
The strong fertility-inhibiting effects of contraception we note among women in their prime childbearing ages are due to the use of contraception for spacing, while at the older ages (40-49) the strengthening Cc values suggest that women are using contraception for stopping child bearing. It is important to note here that the inhibitive effects of contraception have been gaining strength across all age groups which helps to explain why declines in fertility noted in these two countries appear to be pervasive across all age groups, especially among recent birth cohorts (Sibanda, 1997). One

can argue that such changes can only occur after people become amenable to the idea of spacing and limiting their fertility through use of effective contraceptives which are readily available.
POSTPARTUM INFECUNDABILITY (PPI)
In both Kenya and Zimbabwe, the period of postpartum amenorrhea is longer than the period of postpartum abstinence. As a result, the period of postpartum amenorrhea is used as the principal determinant of the length of postpartum infecundability. Table 3 presents median durations, in months, of breast-feeding, postpartum amenorrhea, abstinence, and their combined effects for insusceptibility. The duration of breast-feeding is longer in Kenya than in Zimbabwe by about two months. However, median durations of breast-feeding have changed very little between the two rounds of DHS surveys in each country. Thus, we seem to have the coexistence of long median breast-feeding durations with declines in fertility. This finding strengthens the contention that "fertility declines are not necessarily associated with significant changes in breast-feeding behavior" (Casterline, 1994, p. 75). On the other hand, women in Zimbabwe are postpartum amenorrheic for slightly more than a year, while women in Kenya are postpartum amenorrheic for less than 11 months. The table also shows that in both countries the median durations of postpartum abstinence are very short (less than 5 months), although women in Zimbabwe have slightly longer periods of abstinence than their counterparts in Kenya. Lastly, in terms of the overall period of insusceptibility, the median durations show that this period is longer in Zimbabwe than in Kenya.

An examination of PPI values in Tables 1 and 2 show that PPI plays a very important role in determining levels of fertility in these two countries. The fertility transition that is underway has been accompanied by the strengthening of the fertility-inhibiting impact of PPI. This pattern is different from that suggested by Bongaarts and Potter (1983) who contend that a typical movement from natural to controlled fertility is usually accompanied by a shortening of PPI. However, in the case of Zimbabwe and Kenya, the relative importance of PPI has not decreased between the periods of 1988-94 and 1988-93 respectively. A Ci index of 0.56 in Kenya in 1993 indicates the strong effect of long postpartum insusceptible periods on fertility. Table 2 also shows that in both rounds of KDHS surveys, Ci had the largest fertilityinhibiting effect of all proximate factors in the country. In other words, the relative importance of postpartum infecundability in reducing potential fertility was substantially larger than that of any proximate determinant in Kenya. This finding is consistent with results from other parts of sub-Saharan Africa where marriage has been shown to be more important than contraception in restricting potential total fecundity when fertility levels are still high (Rutstein, 1991). In contrast, postpartum infecundability was second in importance as an inhibitor to contracep-

tion in Zimbabwe in both 1988 and 1994. The results presented in Tables 1 and 2
also show that in the late 1980's, Ci was less important as an influence on lowering fertility, while in the early 1990's the Ci index gained significance. It is important to note that this gain occurred at a time when use of modern contraceptives was on the increase in these two societies. The only difference between Zimbabwe and Kenya is that the fertility-inhibiting effects of breast-feeding patterns appear to be strong at the youngest ages in Zimbabwe, while in Kenya breast-feeding patterns have their greatest reductive effect in the older age groups.
PRIMARY STERILITY
The values of the index of sterility, Ip shown in Tables 1 and 2 only take into account the incidence of primary sterility. Since Ip is based on a 3 per cent standard rate of childlessness in developing countries (Frank, 1983; Bongaarts et al., 1984), the value of Ip will be less than 1 if the proportion of childless women at age 40-49 exceeds this standard rate. Under such circumstances, Ip has the potential to inhibit fertility. By contrast, if the value of Ip is greater than 1, the proportion childless at age 40-49 will be less than the standard childlessness rate of 3 per cent. Such a scenario is normally taken as evidence of the underestimation of the proportion of women childless in a

developing society. Ip values greater than 1 are therefore difficult to interpret in the broader context of the Bongaarts and Potter proximate determinant framework. A value greater than 1 implies that fertility can be increased by low levels of pathological sterility. As a solution, if the Ip index is greater than 1, it is simply reduced to 1 so that it can conform with the general interpretation of the other indexes of the proximate determinants framework. Thus, an Ip value of 1 indicates that the level of sterility does not inhibit fertility while an Ip value of 0 means that pathological sterility does inhibit fertility below its theoretical maximum. In situations where the value of Ip is less than the 3 per cent standard rate, it is most likely due to substantial under-reporting of childlessness or pathological sterility. The stigma associated with childlessness is well documented in many African societies, so it is possible that the incidence of this phenomenon might be under reported (Caldwell and Caldwell, 1987; Larsen, 1989). On the other hand, it is also possible that improvements in reproductive health and diet could have lowered the levels of pathological sterility to levels lower than the suggested 3 per cent standard rate.
A comparison of Ip values in Tables 1 and 2 clearly shows that in both Kenya and Zimbabwe (with the exception of ZDHS-II), the proportions of women childless at age 40-49 were less than the 3 per cent standard rate. In 1988 and 1993, 2.3 per cent and 1.8 per cent of ever-married women aged 40-49 were childless in Kenya, and in Zimbabwe the percentages for 1988 and 1994 were 2.7 per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively. Thus, the results {Ip values greater than 1) suggest that pathological sterility did

not play a significant role in determining the overall level of fertility in Kenya and Zimbabwe at the time that these surveys were taken since it did not inhibit fertility below its theoretical maximum.
Having looked at the fertility-inhibiting effects of these proximate determinants, the following section tries to quantify the effects of these proximate factors in terms of births averted per woman.
EFFECT OF PROXIMATE DETERMINANTS
ON FERTILITY
Much of the credit for the decline in fertility in Kenya, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and South Africa has been attributed to increased contraceptive use by women of reproductive age (Caldwell et al., 1992). This is because the marked increases in contraceptive use seem to have gained momentum at a time when fertility began to decline in these societies. This section will allow us to compare the overall effects of contraceptive use vis-a-vis other proximate determinants toward the decline of fertility from the theoretical maximum (Total Fecundity) to the observed level (Total Fertility Rate). To determine the extent to which the four proximate determinants outlined above account for the decline in fertility in each country and also for the difference in fertility between Zimbabwe and Kenya, this section will utilize a series of models developed by Bongaarts and Potter (1983).
At the national level, fertility declined in Zimbabwe by 21.8 per cent between 1988 and 1994 (from a TFR of 5.5 to 4.3). In Kenya, the TFR declined by 19.4 per cent between 1988 and 1993 (from 6.7 to 5.4). Thus, in these populations, the fall in TFR's is well above 10 per cent, a figure that is usually cited in the literature on historical fertility transitions

T h e following equations are used to compute the percentage change in TFR between ZDHS-1 and ZDHS-II: Pm = Cm2JCml -- 1(proportional change in TFR due to change in the index of marriage); Pc = CC2/CC1 --1 (proportional change due to a change in the index of contraception); Pi = Cp/Cjl -- 1 (proportional change due to a change in the index of postpartum infecundability).

as a key threshold for entry into nonreversible decline (Coale and Watkins, 1986). In terms of the overall TFR decline in Zimbabwe, Table 4 shows that 7.9 per cent of this decline was due to an increase in the use of contraception; 7.5 per cent, to an increase in postpartum infecundability; and 2.5 per cent, to a decrease in the proportion of women in a sexual union. Table 5 shows the percentage of change in TFR that was also due to marriage or union changes, contraception and postpartum infecundability in Kenya. The decline in TFR between these two rounds of KDHS surveys was due to a 3.5 per cent decline in the proportion of women in a sexual union (especially at age 15-19), an 8.75 per cent decline due to a fairly marked increase in contracep-

tive use in the country, and an 18.8 per cent decline due to an increase in the length of the postpartum insusceptible period. These declines can be further decomposed to establish the overall contribution of each proximate factor to the overall reduction in fertility from its theoretical maximum to the current total fertility levels in terms of number of children per woman.
First, the following series of equations developed by Bongaarts and Potter (1983) will be used to calculate the effects of each proximate factor following the specific order in which they are laid out. This specific order is very important because the number of births estimated can vary if the order of these equations is reversed (Jolly and Gribble, 1993):

The effect of marriage patterns = TMFR - TFR, where TMFR = TFR/Cm. The effect of contraception = TNMF TMFR, where TNMF = TFR/(Cm*Cc.) The effect ofpostpartum infecundability = TFR/(Cm*Cc*Ci) - TNMF.
When Ip is greater than 1, the effect of postpartum infecundability = TF - TNMF.
The effect of primary sterility = TF TFR/(Cm* Cc*Ci).
Since Ip is greater than 1in both Zimbabwe andKenya, theeffects of this index are not shown.
EFFECTS OF MARRIAGE
Tables 4 and 5 show the effects ofeach index in births perwoman in Zimbabwe and Kenya. At the national level, marriage patterns reduced fertility by about 1.3and by 1.2 births in Zimbabwe in 1988and 1994. InKenya, marriage patterns also re-

duced fertility by about 1.1 births at the time of KDHS-1 andKDHS-II. Thus, at the national level, marriage patterns ledto a slightly larger decline infertility inZimbabwe than in Kenya.
Looking at the age-specific contributions of marriage patterns to fertility decline in these two populations, we see that thelargest fertility-inhibiting effects of union patterns are exhibited at the youngest ages, that is, 15-19. Although the effects of marriage patterns appear to have slightly weakened atthis age by this time (1993, Kenya and 1994, Zimbabwe), these patterns reduced fertility by more than 1birth at the time of all the 4 DHS surveys in these countries. Tables 4 and 5 also show that the effect ofunion patterns tends to diminish with age. This result is expected at these ages because there isa large proportion of ever-married women in union atthese ages, a feature typicalof

see more births being averted or sacrificed.

EFFECTS OF CONTRACEPTION
The effects of the very high levels of contraceptive use in Zimbabwe are clearly shown in Table 4. Contraceptive use reduced fertility by about 4 births per woman at the time of ZDHS-1 and ZDHSII. In contrast, the low levels of contraceptive use in Kenya led to a rather modest reduction in fertility by about 2 births in 1988, and by 1993 the increase in contraceptive use in the country led to a reduction of fertility by 2.5 births. In terms of the age-specific effects of contraception, it is also clear that the fertility-inhibiting effects of contraceptive use were at their strongest at ages 20-24 and 25-29 in Zimbabwe and at ages 25-29 and 30-34 in Kenya. In Zimbabwe, women who were exposed to on-time fertility (that is, those in the prime child bearing ages 20-24 and 25-29) reduced their fertility by slightly more than 1 birth through contraceptive use. In contrast, the effects of contraception were quite low at these ages in Kenya. In 1988, there was no one group of women in Kenya that reduced its fertility by half a birth through contraceptive use; and by 1993 contraceptive use only led to a slight change in the number of births per woman prevented (about half a birth).
It is important to note that at these young and middle ages, there was a reduction in fertility because young women were resorting to longer spacing durations. At the older ages (40+), the very low numbers of births reduced per woman due to use of contraception seems to indicate that contraceptive use effects for stopping purposes have been minimal in these two populations when compared to what has been going on at young and middle ages. If

EFFECTS OF POSTPARTUM
INFECUNDABILITY
The negative effects of an increase in the postpartum insusceptible period on fertility in Kenya and Zimbabwe is also shown in Tables 4 and 5. In Zimbabwe, observed fertility would have increased by about 5 births in 1988 and by about 6 births in 1994 in the absence of postpartum infecundability. In Kenya, observed fertility would have increased by about 4 and 7 births in 1988 and 1993 in the absence of postpartum infecundability. The age-specific patterns of postpartum infecundability show different trends in these two societies. Table 4 shows that in Zimbabwe the effect of this index was strongest at young and middle ages (15-34) where it reduced fertility by more than 1 birth at each age group. On the other hand, the index of postpartum infecundability appears to be stronger at age 15-19 only at the time of KDHS-I where we have a reduction in fertility of about 1 birth. However, at the time of KDHS-II, Ci had gained in strength among women aged 20-39 where it reduced fertility by more than 1 birth at each age group.
CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, I applied the Bongaarts and Potter model to assess and compare changes in the relative importance of four proximate determinants of fertility between two sets of DHS surveys conducted in Zimbabwe and Kenya. The results show that the fertility-inhibiting effects of contraception are more important than the effects of postpartum infecundability, marriage patterns, or sterility

in Zimbabwe. The results also show that contraceptive patterns have their greatest fertility suppressing effects in the middle and younger age groups. However, in Kenya, the dominant fertility-inhibiting effect is postpartum infecundability, with contraception coming in second. In the case of Kenya, use of contraception seems to inhibit fertility more at the older age groups than at the middle and younger age groups. It is also surprising to note that in both countries, there was no erosion of postpartum practices over time. On the contrary, the inhibiting effects of postpartum infecundability on fertility increased between the two rounds of DHS surveys in each country.
Turning to marriage or union patterns, the above results have also shown that substantial changes in the suppressing effects of marriage or union patterns on fertility have been underway in Zimbabwe and Kenya. The impact is more pronounced at the younger ages, 15-19 and 20-24, which means that early marriage--one of the most important cultural props in the sustenance of high fertility in sub-Saharan Africa--has been weakening. There is undoubtedly a move toward later marriage and the timing of the first birth in these two populations. On the other hand, Mo increased in both countries between the surveys, indicating an increase in nonmarital fertility.
Regarding sterility, the analysis in this paper has shown that this proximate factor has not inhibited fertility below its biological maximum in Zimbabwe and Kenya. The proportions of women aged 40-49 who are childless are below the 3 per cent standard rate of childlessness in developing countries, making the index of sterility (Ip) above 1. However, declining trends in infertility are not causing any apparent rise

in overall fertility in these two countries because the fertility-promoting effects of such declines are being more than offset by the movement in the negative direction in the other primary proximate determinants like contraception, postpartum infecundability, and marriage patterns.
This study has also attempted to quantify the effects of these proximate determinants in terms of the number of children contributed by each factor to the decline relative to TF and the overall percentage change in TFR's. In terms of the latter, the above results have shown that the single biggest drop in fertility is attributable to contraception in Zimbabwe (accounting for about 8 per cent), while in Kenya the largest decline in fertility between 1988 and 1993 is due to postpartum insusceptibility (19 per cent). However, in terms of births per woman, postpartum infecundability has the largest effect in both countries, (5.2 and 5.6 births in Zimbabwe in 1988 and 1994, and about 4.3 and 6.8 births in Kenya in 1988 and 1993, respectively). The effects of contraception came in second in the two countries.
Another important finding is the fairly marked extent to which observed levels of fertility in Kenya and Zimbabwe can be attributed to concomitant variations in postpartum lactational infecundability, contraception, and nuptiality. Major changes in these proximate determinants over time will undoubtedly contribute to a clear understanding and explanation of fertility transitions that are already underway in these societies. Data on proximate determinants, which have become a key feature of DHS surveys, will also allow us to monitor the magnitude and nature of differences in fertility in various parts of sub-Saharan Africa as they enter the fertility transition.
