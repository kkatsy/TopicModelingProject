ABSTRACT: The number of births reported by 786 women of native ancestry on the 1954 census of St. Barthélémy, French West Indies, was compared to the number of births registered to these same women in the records of vital events. The magnitude of the difference between the two numbers was related to a woman's parity and marital status, but not to her age or literacy. In general, the agreement between the two numbers was very high, with the mean of reported parities within 5 per cent of the mean of registered births for all age groups except one, where the difference was 5.6 per cent. The women of St. Barthélémy were well able to remember the number of children they had borne. It appears likely that the discrepancies between reported parities and registered statistics in previous studies are the result of cultural misunderstandings in questionnaires, or perhaps sample decay, rather than of women's memory loss.

Much of what we know of human behavior is ultimately derived from data gathered through informant interviews. For obvious ethical reasons, all but the most benign types of experiments on human subjects are impossible, and the events of a human lifetime unfold far too slowly for direct observation of life-stage changes to be practical in any but a handful of wellfunded projects. Anthropologists have traditionally relied on participant observation for data collection, but field work is often expensive, funding difficult to obtain, and research time limited. A year, or even several years, of residence in a study population may be inadequate to observe all relevant aspects of cultural behavior directly. Even anthropologists rely to a large degree on recall and report data.
Unfortunately, the accuracy of data obtained from informant interviews is not always easy to assess. Some threats to data, such as reactivity and the ex-

pectations of both subject and researcher, have been well documented (Bernard et al., 1984), but accuracy has been a difficult problem to approach, at least partially because independent sources of data verification seldom exist. Many researchers mention the problem of informant accuracy in the opening paragraphs of their work and may indicate probable directions of bias and the effect that such bias may have on the results of a study. But even if the possibility of bias has been mentioned, it is seldom possible to do anything about it, and data are often used as if they were true (Freeman et al., 1987), perhaps because even faulty data are seen as being better than no data at all. But if data are to be used in major policy decisions, inaccuracy can lead to costly mistakes. The accuracy of data is a real problem of potentially major proportions.
The magnitude of the problem can be seen in the results of those studies

that have been successful in measuring discrepancies between reality and informant reports. In a review of these studies, Bernard et al. (1984) concluded that approximately half of what informants tell researchers is wrong; studies in child development showed that the inaccuracy level of mothers was one-third to three-quarters when they were asked to recall their children's scholastic abilities and health status; 59 per cent of chronic medical conditions went unreported in one study; people could not recall about half of their telecommunications with others over a three-week period in another, and so on. In a more recent study of attendance at one of a series of meetings, informants were found to have reported the presence of people who were not there and to have omitted the presence of people who had attended, with 141 errors made out of 272 reporting opportunities, a rate of 52 per cent (Freeman et al., 1987).
Evidently, a major source of informant error is the tendency to report general rather than specific events. Cultural expectations or norms may be elicited in response to questions, whether in a conscious attempt by subjects to appear to have followed cultural prescriptions, as in reporting intervals between marriages and first births, or whether as a result of the tendency for people with well-developed mental structures to perceive things as they ought to be, and not necessarily as they are (see Bernard et al., 1984; Freeman et al., 1987; Rindfuss and Morgan, 1983). The tendency to perceive norms and not reality is, of course, shared by supposedly objective scientists and is not restricted to the re-

porting of recall data by informants. It is probably responsible for the observed tendency for women over the age of thirty-five to be subjected to high rates of Caesarean section despite the absence of objective differences in indications for operative delivery (see Grimes and Gross, 1981, and Kirz et al., 1985), and has been the subject of recent discussions concerning the interaction between anthropologists and their data (see Kirschner, 1987; Mascia-Lees et al., 1989). It is important to note that for the most part the discrepancy between informant reports and reality is not the fault of the informants, who, except in rare instances of intentional deception, are accurately reporting their perceptions. Some researchers have emphasized the importance of phrasing questions and conducting interviews in such a way as to minimize errors (Bateson, 1979; Potter, 1977), although in the absence of independent sources of data, it may be difficult to know when this goal has been achieved. And Blacker and Brass (1979) remind us that errors may be substantial even with careful questioning. Discrepancies between perceptions and reality are also, for the most part, not a problem to the informants themselves, as most people seem to get along quite well using their schematic constructs of reality (Bernard et al., 1984).
One area in which differences between informant reports and reality may be of some importance is in the area of demographic research. Often interviews are the only source of data at the family and local levels for estimating period and cohort fertility rates, especially when vital registration

is incomplete (Blacker and Brass, 1979; Potter, 1977). These interview data may be the basis for major population policy decisions, affecting expensive programs. Again, those studies that have been done of comparisons between informant reports and reality in demographic matters are not encouraging. In a study of the French population of St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Morrill and Dyke (1980) found that 25 per cent of the people listed in records of the population were forgotten in informant interviews despite considerable efforts to make a complete enumeration. Increasing collateral distance from the informants made omission more likely, so that those who left few or no descendants in the population were most likely to be omitted. The authors of the study concluded that the failure to remember past population members will inflate population growth rate estimates whenever informants are used to construct genealogies. Adams and Kasakoff (1980) calculated a similar rate of 10 to 30 per cent loss of persons from genealogies. The implication, of course, is that populations without written records, the so-called "preliterate" groups, may not be increasing as rapidly as supposed.
On the other hand, when birth histories are the focus of inquiry, fertility rates may appear to be declining when in fact they are not, or to be declining more rapidly than they really are. Potter (1977) showed in a series of computer simulations that a few logical assumptions concerning informant errors in omitted births and event misplacement could produce a commonly reported pattern of change in cohort

fertility schedules, with fertility declines concentrated in the oldest reproductive age groups. Other possible sources of error in demographic data which may be of concern include falsifying the intervals between marriage and first birth, as has already been mentioned, and a failure to report the births of children who later died, either because these children were female, because they were not considered real people until they had reached a certain age, because of a taboo on speaking of the dead, or because the deaths of some children were less than accidental.
Some researchers have been able to devise independent checks on informant accuracy to assess the frequency and types of errors most likely to be made, but it is rare for those involved in fertility studies in developing countries to have access to independent sources of data. Checks for internal consistency, guesses as to possible sources and direction of bias in the data, and estimates of probable error magnitude are all possible, but may remain little more than speculation in most cases. The present study compares the answers to a fertility question on the French national census of 1954 asked of 786 women of native ancestry on the island of St. Barth6Iemy, French West Indies with the same information derived from records of vital events that were made as the births happened. Because the vital records for this population are extremely accurate, it has been possible to estimate the magnitude of reporting errors quite closely and to identify some of the demographic characteristics of those women who were most likely to report

a different number of children on the census than were recorded in the birth registers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
St. Barthelemy (St. Bart) is a dry island of approximately twenty-five square kilometers located in the French West Indies. St. Martin is the closest inhabited island, and Saba and Statia can be seen on clear days. St. Bart's first permanent settlement occurred in 1659 when the French sent a company of thirty colonists from St. Kitts to protect St. Bart's harbor from the British. St. Bart is too rugged and dry for plantation agriculture, and the only sugar mill built on the island failed immediately (Bourdin, 1978). But the harbor is excellent, and St. Bart is located near the Anegada Passage, one of the few places that large sailing vessels could beat their way between islands out of the Caribbean Sea. Its strategic importance was great, and it was frequently the object of hostile attention and attack by the major European powers as they fought for ascendancy in the Caribbean, and was always a haven for pirates (Bourdin, 1978; Lasserre, 1961).
St. Bart's most prosperous period before the present started in 1758 when the French government ceded the island to Sweden in return for trading privileges in Gothenberg. As a neutral port, St. Bart rapidly became the center of regional trade, with its capital city growing from a small village of huts and mud paths to a well-planned city of five thousand in just a few years (Bourdin, 1978; Lasserre, 1961). The prosperity was short-lived, however,

and in 1814 when the Treaty of Paris established peace between the European nations, trade was lost to St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, on the other side of the Anegada Passage, whose superior deep-water harbor could accommodate more and larger vessels (Bourdin, 1978). By 1840 the total population of St. Bart had declined by two-thirds, and in 1878 Sweden returned St. Bart to France.
Despite the rise and fall of the fortunes of St. Bart's commercial center, life in the countryside changed very little over hundreds of years. The people of St. Bart traditionally made their living with a brush fallow system of slash and burn farming on small holdings, raising maize, pigeon peas, millet or Guinea corn, and different kinds of roots, such as igname, malanga, and manioc. In the rainy season herbs and vegetables such as squash, melon, peppers, tomatoes, and okra were also grown. A few goats and chickens were raised, and the men did some fishing. At various times the sale of small amounts of salt, indigo, cotton, and tobacco have provided some cash income (Bourdin, 1978; Lasserre, 1961). This way of life persists even today, although the tourist boom which began in the late 1970's opened new jobs in construction, commerce, and hotel service and created an alternative lifestyle that many of the younger St. Barts have embraced. In 1954, when the census data used in this study were collected, St. Bart's population shared in the general poverty of the Caribbean (Lasserre, 1961), although life expectancies at birth had increased to 56.7 years for males and 67.6 years for females (Brittain, 1990). Over half of the

adult population was either illiterate, or able to read and write only a few words (Lasserre, 1961).
Since St. Bart was returned to France in 1878, the French government has kept records of the births, deaths, and marriages that have taken place on the island. The recording of these events is very important for French citizens, and the rate of compliance has been extremely high. The records of vital events from 1878 to the present have been photographed, and the records to 1976 have been computerized. The various records for each individual have been combined, and families and sibships have been assembled, creating genealogies with a depth of several generations. The earlier records have been checked for accuracy against church records, and the more recent records have been compared to the listesnominatives sections of government censuses taken in 1954, 1961, and 1967, and checked in field studies in 1972, 1973, and 1975-76, with the result that they are a highly accurate representation of the experience of the island's population (see Brittain et al., 1988). Altogether, approximately 10,000 individuals appear in the records of vital events.
In 1954 the French government conducted a population census of St. Barth616my. There were 2,017 people living on the island, of whom 1,812 were of native St. Bart ancestry. Of the people of St. Bart ancestry, 786 were females aged 15 and older who had been born since the French began keeping records in 1878. For each of the women a single question reported how many children had been born alive. To a large extent the single-question life-

history fertility question has been replaced by a series of questions concerning children still living with the mother, children living elsewhere and children who had died, the major motive for the change being concerns about the accuracy of the data obtained (Blacker and Brass, 1979). In this study, the number of children reported in the census was compared to the number of live births listed in the records of vital events for each of the 786 women. There were 1,550 children reported in the census and 1,574 live births listed in the records of vital events.
Among the variables commonly considered as probable causes of errors in reported fertility are the age of the woman, her marital status, literacy, and parity. The age of each woman at the time of the census was included in this study as an independent variable that might affect reporting accuracy on the theory that older women would be more likely to have forgotten some of the children they had borne, particularly if some of those children had died early in life. Blacker and Brass (1979) suggest that older women may be more likely to misunderstand questions or to have memory lapses than are younger women, and Potter (1977) and Bernard et al. (1984) suggest that reporting errors are more common the longer the time that has elapsed since an event. It is, of course, possible that older women might have exaggerated the number of children they had borne for dramatic effect, but it is hypothesized here that age would be positively correlated with the number of omissions made in the reporting of births. The ages used in the analysis were the ages calculated from the records of the

224

women's births to avoid any bias that might be introduced in using selfreported ages.
Marital status was included as an independent variable in this study because it has been suggested that illegitimate children are more likely to be omitted from birth histories than are other children (Potter, 1977). It may be, therefore, that unmarried women would be more likely than married women to have discrepancies in the number of live births reported on the census and the number registered in the records of vital events. Literacy was included as a variable because some researchers have been concerned that educational level may affect the quality of reported data, whether the predicted biases affect the conclusions of the study or not (Blacker and Brass, 1979; Das Gupta, 1987). It was hypothesized here that literate women would show greater accuracy in reporting births than would illiterate women. Finally, parity was included as an independent variable on the theory that intervening events might be as important as elapsed time in modifying recall of the past. Perhaps those women who had had the most births would be most likely to have hazier recollections of earlier births and therefore to make more reporting errors.
Age, marital status, literacy, and parity were considered in SPSS-X stepwise regression procedures (see Norusis, 1983) as independent variables that might explain any differences in the number of live births that each woman reported on the census and the number registered to her in the records of vital events. Variables of potential importance in distorting the results of fertility studies that are not addressed here

are the accuracy of women in reporting their own ages, sample decay, or the possible relationship between parity and maternal survival to the time of the census, and event misplacement, which is impossible to address on the basis of the single-question fertility history.
RESULTS
Of the 786 women of native ancestry aged fifteen and older born after the French began keeping records in 1878 and living on St. Bart in 1954, 397 were married or widowed, and 389 had never been married. The mean number of children registered in the records of vital events was 2.00 per woman, with a standard deviation of 2.81, and a range from zero to seventeen live births. The self-reported literacy rate was 60.6 per cent for these women, with older women less likely to be literate than younger women (r = -0.561, F(l,784) = 360.90,/? < 0.01). Fifty-four of the 786 women, 6.9 per cent, had discrepancies between the number of births reported on the census and the number registered in the records of vital events. Thirty-seven women reported from one to four fewer live births than were registered, and seventeen women reported from one to five births more. The average difference in reported and recorded live births was 0.031 births per woman. The main effects of the independent variables were as follows (Table 1):

make supporting illegitimate children very difficult for a woman and her family, and reinforce the religious and moral proscriptions that place strong emphasis on childbearing only in the context of marriage. The relationship between the difference in the number of a woman's reported and registered births and her marital status did not, however, reach statistical significance (r = 0.040, F(l,784) = 1.26, n.s.).
The errors made by unmarried women were not solely errors of omission: 28.57 per cent of unmarried women and 31.91 per cent of married women who made reporting errors reported more births on the census than were registered in the records of vital events. In one case it was obvious that an older sister who had remained unmarried and who had helped to raise her siblings had reported on the census the number of children her deceased mother had borne. Other unmarried women may have made similar errors in reporting as their own children siblings, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews that they had raised. Married women might also have included children fathered by their husbands outside of the marriage if they were responsible for their welfare.
Literacy.--It was hypothesized that illiterate women might be less likely to have developed the mental constructs necessary to quantify events rather than simply experience them and would therefore be more inclined to make errors in reporting the number of live births they had had. As has been mentioned, literacy in this population, as in many others, was negatively related to age, with younger women being more likely than older women to be able to read and write at least a few

words. Literate women were less likely to be married than were illiterate women (r = -0.184, F(l,784) = 27.47, p < 0.01) and had fewer children than illiterate women (r = -0.248, F(l,784) = 51.38, p<0.01), but there was no relationship between literacy and the difference in the number of births a woman reported and the number registered in the records of vital events (r = -0.003, F(l,784) = 0.01, n.s.).
Parity.--It was hypothesized that women who had given birth to only a few children might be expected to remember each event more distinctly than would women who had had many children and therefore to make fewer reporting errors. If informants with more experience in certain areas have better developed mental structures than others, and are therefore more likely to recall general rather than specific events as Freeman et al. (1987) suggest, it may be that women with many births might be more likely to make errors in reporting the number of live births they had had. Indeed, there was a statistically significant relationship in this population between the number of live births a woman had had, as registered in the records of vital events, and the number of births omitted in the census (r = 0.177, F(l,784) = 25.36, p<0.01). Interestingly, those women who had had the greatest number of stillbirths were somewhat less likely than others to underreport live births on the census (r = -0.243, F(l,784) = 49.20, p < 0.01). Perhaps they were more likely to remember each child as having lived for at least a short time, if that was the norm of their experience.

marital status, literacy, and parity, as measured by the number of live births registered in the records of vital events, were considered together, both parity and marital status contributed significantly to the variation in the difference between the number of live births a woman reported on the census and the number of live births registered to her in the records of vital events (R = 0.202, F(2,783) = 16.68, p<0.01). Specifically, women with more live births were more likely to make omissions on the census than were other women, and when the number of births was controlled, married women were less likely to omit reporting births than were unmarried women. The observed tendency for unmarried women to make fewer omissions in reporting births was indeed because they had fewer births to report. Despite the statistical significance of the relationships, however, only 4.09 per cent of the variation in reporting errors was explained.
As has already been mentioned, the number of stillbirths a woman had had was significantly related to the number of omissions in the reporting of live births (r = -0.243, F(l,784) = 49.20, p<0.01), with women who had the greatest number of stillbirths being either less likely to omit mentioning some live births, or perhaps to include at least some of the stillbirths in their reports of live births than were other women. When the number of stillbirths was included as a fifth explanatory variable in the multivariate analysis, it joined the number of live births and marital status as being significantly related to the variation in the difference in the number of live births reported and registered (R = 0.332, F(3,782) =

32.38, p < 0.01). With the number of stillbirths included in the analysis, 11.05 per cent of the variation in the difference between reported and registered live births was explained.
DISCUSSION
Unfortunately, despite the possibility of identifying some of the demographic factors that led to misreporting the number of live births on the 1954 census, it was impossible to use this information to produce a useful estimate of the magnitude of the reporting errors likely to be made by women based on the information available on the census. Although the difference in the number of live births reported on the census and registered in the records of vital events was significantly related to the number of live births registered in the records of vital events (r = 0.177, F(l,784) = 25.36, p < 0.01), it was not significantly related to the number of live births reported on the census (r = 0.023, F(l,784) = 0.415, n.s.). When the number of live births reported on the census was substituted for parity as derived from the records of vital events in the multivariate analysis, marital status was also not a significant factor in predicting reporting errors. The information available from the census alone cannot be used to predict errors in reported fertility.
Fortunately, however, predicting the difference between the number of live births a woman reported on the census and the number registered in the records of vital events probably would not be necessary for this population. Despite the fact that 6.9 per cent of all women, including 11.8 per cent of married women, did not report

228

the same number of live births as were registered, the overall accuracy of the fertility data derived from the census was excellent. The mean number of live births registered in the records of vital events was 2.00 per woman, with a standard deviation of 2.81, while the mean number of live births reported in the census was 1.97 per woman with a standard deviation of 2.77. For all women, the average difference in reported and registered live births was 0.03 births per woman, approximately 1.52 per cent of the mean parity. For married women it was 1.26 per cent of the mean parity of 3.81 live births per woman, and for unmarried women it was 8.06 per cent of the mean parity of 0.16 live births per woman.
The correlation between the number of live births each woman reported on the census and the number registered to her name in the records of vital events was very high (r = 0.988, F(l,784) = 32,229.53, p<0.01), with the number of live births registered in the records explaining 97.26 per cent of the variation in the number reported in the census. Given the number of live births a woman reported on the census, it is possible to predict the actual number of live births she had had with a high degree of confidence using Equation 1.

woman had registered in the records of vital events, and NCEN = the number of live births reported on the census.
As the maximum number of live births for a woman in this population

was seventeen, the best strategy for determining the actual number of live births a woman had had, given her response to the fertility question on the census, would simply be to take her word for it.
Table 2 shows the distribution of parities by age group. Table 3 shows the kinds of reporting errors made, and Table 4 compares the mean number of births registered and reported. Despite the fact that in five out of twelve age categories the number of females with reporting errors exceeded 5 per cent, the magnitude of the errors made was small enough that only the 25-29 age group showed a difference in reported and registered parities of greater than 5 per cent, and that was 5.63 per cent. The agreement between the number of live births reported on the census and registered in the records of vital events is very high. The average parities obtained for the various age groups could be used with confidence for almost any

purpose, and although the significant relationships between age and the probability of reporting errors, and between parity and marital status and the probability of reporting errors, might create difficulties in relating other demographic variables to fertility, these difficulties could be largely overcome by confining analysis to women of childbearing age. Of the 458 women aged 15-44 only 3.06 per cent made any kind of reporting error, while 10.06 percent of the 328 women aged 45 and older made errors. If it is true that rephrasing questions and adding more specific inquiries about children who died increases the accuracy of fertility reporting,the women in this population would be able to produce fertility reports that would be very accurate indeed.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The difference between the number of live births reported on the 1954 census of St. Barthe'le'my by women of native ancestry aged fifteen and older and the number of live births recorded for these women in the records of vital events was calculated. SPSS-X regression analysis was used to determine the effects of the woman's age, her marital status, whether or not she was literate, and the number of live children she had borne, as registered in the records of vital events, on the size of the difference between these two numbers. The difference between reported and registered births was significantly related to the total number of live children the woman had borne, and to her marital status. Age and literacy had no apparent effect. Women with more live births were more likely to make omis-

sions on the census, as were unmarried women when the other variables were controlled. Together these two variables accounted for 4.09 per cent of the variance in reporting errors. When the number of stillbirths a woman had experienced was included in the analysis, 11.05 per cent of the variance in reporting errors was explained, with women who had experienced more stillbirths being either less likely to omit mentioning some live births, or more likely to report some stillbirths as live births than were other women.
Despite the relationship between the number of live children a woman had borne, as measured by the number of births registered to her in the records of vital events, and the magnitude of the reporting error made on the census, the number of births reported on the census was not related to the magnitude of the reporting error. It was impossible to predict the magnitude of the error a woman was likely to make in reporting the number of live children she had borne on the basis of data available from the census alone. Fortunately, this does not present a major problem. The average number of live births reported on the census differed from the average number registered in the records of vital events by only 1.52 per cent of the average parity of 2.00 live births per woman. Only the 25-29 year age group had an average reported parity that differed by more than 5 per cent from the true average, and that difference was 5.6 per cent.
Of the total of 786 women of native ancestry aged fifteen and older only 47, 5.68 per cent, made reporting errors of any kind. For the 458 women aged 15-44 only 14,3.06 per cent, made any reporting errors. The best predictor of the number of live children a woman

had actually borne was simply the number she reported on the census. Women in this population were well able to remember the number of children they had borne and reported this number with a high degree of accuracy in response to a single question fertility survey on the 1954 census. If multiplequestion surveys do indeed produce better results than single-question ones, the accuracy of the data these women would be able to provide would be remarkable.
Given the results of this study, it may be surprising that the conclusions to be drawn are not entirely optimistic. The fact that women remember how many children they have borne is encouraging, but does not necessarily mean that they will tell researchers what they need to know. Blacker and Brass (1979) list some of the problems encountered in previous studies, including discrepancies in data taken from registers and censuses, and from pregnancy histories and general questions concerning the number of births. The data presented here suggest that memory lapses are not necessarily the cause of these problems, but do not deny the existence of problems. Instead, they suggest that language differences, cultural definitions of "children" or "offspring," taboos on speaking of the dead, or deliberate concealment of infanticide or falsification of birth dates, none of which were apparently encountered on a large scale in the French census of St. Barth&e'my, may be more important sources of error. These problems may or may not be more amenable to correction than simple forgetfulness.
The data presented here also suggest that other possible sources of bias in fertility surveys need to be investi-

gated more thoroughly. When the infant mortality rates calculated from survey data are lower than those expected on the basis of national statistics, as is frequently the case, the difficulty may not be in the accuracy of the survey. Even if all women recall and report their fertility histories with complete precision, other sources of potential bias, including the differential migration and differential mortality of adult women of different parities may exist. Potter (1977) has expressed the opinion that in a population closed to migration the bias introduced by the selective mortality of women by parity is "probably negligible when the expectation of life at birth exceeds 50 years and attention is restricted to the ten years preceding the survey" (p. 341), but in the absence of supporting data this must be seen as a hope, rather than a fact. Data presented by Philippe and Yelle (1976) certainly suggest that mortality among females over the age of fifty is not random with respect to parity, a potential problem when older women are surveyed to determine secular fertility trends.
Women from the island of St. Barthe'le'my, French West Indies are apparently well aware of the number of children they have borne. Numerous studies have suggested that the data obtained from fertility surveys is suspect, and this study, unfortunately, does not contradict this. Instead, it indicates that errors are unlikely to be due to the faulty memories of the women questioned. Potential sources of bias may be more likely to be found in cultural differences in the definition of the subject under discussion or in the nonrandom component of adult female mortality.
