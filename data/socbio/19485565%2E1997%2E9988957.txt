In his comment on my paper entitled "Immaculate Conceptions in Sub-Saharan Africa: Inconsistencies in the Timing of First Sexual Intercourse and First Birth" (Meekers, 1995), Smith kindly remarks that my use of the term immaculate conceptions differs from the term "Immaculate Conception" (capitalized and singular) found in most dictionaries and encyclopedias. It is of course true that my paper does not refer to the Roman Catholic dogma described by the latter term. Instead, my paper refers to inconsistencies in reports on the timing of first sexual intercourse and the timing of first birth, as indicated in the title. The first page of the paper further explicitly defines the terminology in order to avoid any confusion.
The implicit recommendation offered by Dr. Smith is to use the term "virgin births" instead. In the anthropological literature the term "virgin births" refers to ideologies that claim that coitus has no bearing on conception, and thus explain childbirth without referring to physiological paternity (see especially Leach, 1966, and Spiro, 1968, as well as several comments on these papers, e.g., Kaberry, 1968, and Schneider, 1968). In the interest of brevity, my paper addressed the reasons for rejecting this terminology only in footnote (p. 151). The suggestion that there is evidence of virgin birth ide-

ologies in sub-Saharan Africa is incorrect and calls for a more detailed comment on African theories of conception.
While it would be too time-consuming to conduct an exhaustive survey of theories of conception in all African societies, a cursory look at the anthropological literature shows no evidence that such ideologies exist in African societies. As Bleek (1976, p. 68) remarks, although some Australian aboriginal peoples do not believe that there is a connection between sexual activity and pregnancy, other societies do make that link.
Theories of conception do vary across societies, often with different emphasis being put on the role of the mother and father. Matrilineal societies tend to emphasize the role of menstrual blood, while patrilineal societies emphasize the role of sperm (Paige and Paige, 1981, pp. 168, 210). Despite such differences, ideologies of virgin births appear to be absent throughout sub-Saharan Africa, as demonstrated by the following examples of the traditional beliefs about conception among the Akan, Bemba, Igbo, Kanuri, Sukuma, Haya, Gikuyu, !Kung, and Tswana:
The Igbo (Nigeria) recognize the biological aspects of conception, although they believe that conception is impossible without the willingness of deceased lineage mem-

bers to reincarnate themselves (Uchendu, 1965, p. 57).
The Kanuri (Nigeria) believe that conception results from simultaneous orgasm during sexual intercourse, with the latter typically being retroactively labeled after a pregnancy has occurred (Cohen, 1967, p. 53-54).
The Sukuma (Tanzania) recognize physiological paternity. Traditionally, a Sukuma couple was observed during their wedding night to ensure that they had the ability to have intercourse, and thus the ability to have children.
The Haya (Tanzania) recognize physiological paternity, but attribute paternity of a child to the man who first had intercourse with the child's mother (or the first intercourse after her last birth, if she already had children) no matter how much later the conception occurred (van Pelt, 1971,p. 9 4 95).
The Gikuyu (Kenya) argue that it is a couple's duty to produce children, and consider sexual intercourse an act of production (Kenyatta, 1938, p. 149-157). The existence of the traditional Gikuyu practice of ngweko, a socially approved form of fondling without sexual intercourse that allowed adolescent couples to be intimate while conforming to cultural rules regarding virginity and premarital pregnancy, is another indication of Gikuyu awareness of the link between sexual intercourse and pregnancy.
The !Kung (Botswana) understand that pregnancy results from sexual intercourse, although they believe that conception occurs at the end of the menses, when the father's semen joins the last of menstrual blood (Shostak, 1983, p. 177).
The Tswana (Botswana) tell very young children that mothers fetch their babies from a pool in the river, but all adults and most older children do recognize that conception results from sexual intercourse (Schapera, 1971, p. 193).

Akan youths (Ghana) are said typically to gain an understanding of the biological connection between sex and pregnancy some time between the ages of 8 and 16 years, although it is commonly believed that sexual intercourse allows blood, rather than semen, to create a baby (Bleek, 1976).
The Bemba (Zambia), a matrilineal group as are the Akan, also recognize that pregnancy results from sexual intercourse, although traditional ideology posits that the father's semen merely activates a fetus which is already in the womb (Richards 1950, p. 222-23).
From this brief review of African theories of conception it is evident that the link between sexual intercourse and pregnancy is recognized widely, even in instances where the details of these theories are incorrect. Moreover, even among matrilineal African societies, such as the Akan and Bemba, where the role of the genitor is not very important and where a woman's husband is not granted jurai rights over his biological children, the relationship between a child and the biological father is still recognized. (Note also that even societies that believe in magical conception tend to have some awareness of the physiology of sex and pregnancy; see Paige and Paige, 1981, p. 169).
Because of this widespread recognition of physiological paternity, a strong case can be made against the use of the term "virgin births" to label inconsistencies in the timing of first sexual intercourse and first birth in sub-Saharan Africa. However, I would like to remind the readers that the choice of terminology adopted does not touch on the central theme of my paper, which is that researchers ought to be cautious when analyzing data on the relative timing of first intercourse and first birth.
