Proposed Organization of an Association of Behavioral Genetics

An informal meeting of participants at the 1969 Princeton Conference on Populations Genetics, November 8, discussed further action in respect to organization ofan Association of Behavioral Genetics.
It was decided that a more extensive mailing to persons publishing in the field of behavioral genetics was desirable and that such a mailing should include a ballot for election of an Organizing Committee.

Drs. L. Erlenmeyer-Kimling, ElvingAnderson, and John Loehlin were requested to prepare this second mailing. The results of the ballot will be counted and discussed at an informal meeting of this group attending the AAAS meetings in Boston, December 30. Theresults of theballot and further organizing plans will be announced in theMarch issue of Social Biology.
