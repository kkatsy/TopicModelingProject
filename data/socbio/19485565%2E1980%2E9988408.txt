Erratum: Letter to the Editor by Ernest B. Hook on "Human Germinal Mutations: Monitoring for Environmental Effects," Vol. 26, No. 2,1979

Because I did not see the galleys before publication, several typographical errors in the paper, "Human Germinal Mutations: Monitoring for Environmental Effects" (Social Biology 26:104-116, 1979) were uncorrected before publication. The most serious of these resulted in a printed livebirth prevalence rate for the XO genotype of lxl0~6; it should have read lxlO"4.

The rate for 47, +13 was given as lxO.5xlO~4; it should have read 1-- 0.5x10-" (that is between 0.5xl0-4 and lxlO"4). (In fact, recent data suggest lxlO"4 is in fact the best estimate.) Other minor errors are misspellings of authors' names; "M. Neil" should be M. Nei, and "A. A. Stein" is Z. A. Stein,
