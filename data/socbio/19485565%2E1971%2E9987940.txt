There has been vertical as well as spatial mobility of the Negro. On a relative basis, gains in occupation, income, and education have been greater among blacks than among whites, but wide differentials still exist.
With respect to births, the blacks conspicuously outdid the whites in the postwar baby boom. They resemble the whites with respect to patterns of decline in birth rates since 195*7. Reflecting in part the delay of health progress among the blacks, the recent proportionate gains in life expectency have been somewhat larger for blacks than for whites.
In keeping with the growing interest in the economic, social, and demographic status of the blacks, a session on "Black Demography" was held April 22-24, 1971, at the meetings of the Population Associa-
* Milbank Memorial Fund, New York, New York.

the April 1970 Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly.
The papers and discussions presented at the session on "Black Demography" are brought together in the pages that follow. It is believed that a wide band of reciprocal relevance exists between the two subjects "Black Demography" and "Social Biology."
In the initial paper, Dr. Reynolds Farley of the University of Michigan presents some indicators of recent demographic change among blacks. His indicators are based largely upon census data. In the second paper Dr. Joseph S. Himes of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro describes certain characteristics of migration of blacks in the United States. His paper is briefly discussed by Dr. Daniel O. Price of the University of Texas at Austin. In the third paper, Dr. Gordon F. Sutton of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst assesses the mortality and

versity argues that the category "race" is not needed in the census and in demographic analysis. A rebuttal to this point of view is given by Dr. G. Franklin Edwards of Howard University.
