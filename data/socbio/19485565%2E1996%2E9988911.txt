ABSTRACT: Between the early 1970's and 1990's, twelve industrialized nations experienced for the first time a narrowing of their sex differences in life expectancy at age zero. In another set of countries, the differential has not yet reached a stage of convergence, although in some of these nations the female advantage appears to be increasing at a slower pace than ever before. We discuss the demographic and epidemiologic conditions for this new and largely unanticipated trend, as well as its applied and theoretical implications in the context of the following questions: (1) Is the observed change a function of males' faster pace of gains in life expectancy since the early 1970s? (2) What is the relationship between country differences in socioeconomic development (as measured by GNP) and the degree of convergence in the sex gap in average length of life? (3) What is the degree of association between temporal change in age-sex specific death rates and change in the sex gap in life expectancy over the twenty-year interval between the early 1970s and early 1990s? Our results indicate that where some convergence has taken place, in relation to women, men have experienced more rapid gains in survival; the higher a nation's level of social and economic development, the greater the amount of convergence in male and female life expectancies. The most pronounced age-specific association with the changing sex gap in longevity is that of ages 25-59, where the greater reductions in male mortality, as compared to that for females, contributed to a significant portion of the observed convergence in life expectancy across industrialized nations.

Since the turn of this century, the sex gap in life expectancy has widened in all Western countries from approximately two to three years in favor of women, to the current difference in the range of four to seven years (Lopez, 1983; Nathanson, 1984; Nathanson and Lopez, 1989; Tomason, 1984; Waldron, 1976; Wingard, 1984). However, between the early 1970's and the early part of the 1990's, some industrialized nations have experienced for the first time a narrowing of their sex differences in life expectancy at age zero. In

another set of countries the differential has not yet reached a stage of convergence, but over the last two decades the female advantage appears to be increasing at a slower pace than ever before. By its very nature, this unprecedented development falls in the same class of phenomena as the baby boom and baby bust of the post-War years and the unanticipated reductions in old-age mortality since the early part of the 1970's (Stone and Fletcher, 1986; Mantón, 1982; Fries, 1980; Olshansky and Ault, 1986).

mographic events was their unexpectedness, such that few scholars had predicted a priori their developments.
As far as we can determine, on an international scale there is no sign of convergence prior to the early part of the 1970's. For instance, in his analysis of thirty nations in the interval between 1950 and 1978, Lopez (1983) presents data which indicate that only between the quinquennial periods of 1970-74 and 1975-78 do we see some evidence of narrowing sex differences in life expectation, with five countries (Japan, Austria, England-Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland) showing a 0.10 of a year reduction in their differentials. Although he paid no attention to this numerical fact, in his concluding comments he stated that there exists " . . . the [eventual] possibility of a stabilization, if not reduction, in the size of the sex mortality differential" (p. 106).
Olshansky and Ault (1986) noted that in the early part of the 1980's the United States had entered a new stage of epidemiological development, which they call the "age of delayed and degenerative diseases," characterized (among other things) by a general delay of the ages at which chronic and degenerative diseases tend to kill. An important corollary of this stage of epidemiological transition is that future gains in longevity will be made increasingly at older ages since gains at the younger ages have become smaller over time and may be reaching a plateau in terms of further improvements. In this context, they project that "the historical pattern of a widening gap in longevity between the sexes . . . [will come] to an end during the fourth stage

of epidemiological transition in the United States" (p. 364). They did not elaborate the reasons underlying this prediction, nor did they offer any indication as to whether the same trend would prevail in other nations.
Only very recently have there been systematic attempts at documenting the possibility that male/female mortality differences in the industrialized world may be declining. In her investigation of sex differences mortality for adults in the developed world, Waldron (1993) discovered that across 22 nations between the years of 1977 and 1979, male/female mortality ratios continued to increase for persons in the age group 25-34, but at the older ages the pattern is mixed. For example, death ratios went up for 55-64 year olds in Southern Europe, Eastern Europe and in Japan, but declined in some North European societies and among Anglo-Saxon nations. In Canada, Gee and Veevers (1988) examined changes in sex ratios in mortality for the period 1966 to 1985 for the age groups of 45-54 and 55-64. They showed some evidence of a middleaged turnaround in the sex differential.
Given the recency of this phenomenon, and its generality across a significant portion of the industrialized world, analysis is timely and will be of practical value to those interested in establishing parameters for sex differences in life expectancy in the context of mortality projections (e.g., Olshansky, 1988; Valkonen, 1991; Coale, 1990; Krishnan, 1992; Lee and Carter, 1990; Bulatao and Bos, 1990; McNown and Rogers, 1990; Mantón et al., 1991). Theorists will want to consider the implications of this new trend for

its sociological and social psychological underpinnings in the context of rapid social and demographic change: We feel that this development is part of a larger configuration of social and demographic evolution witnessed by the industrialized world during the postWar years.
The onset of narrowing sex differences in survival may be closely associated with convergence in genderbased behaviors and life styles in recent decades (Nathanson, 1992; Waldron, 1993; Wister and Gee, 1994). For example, it has been hypothesized that sex differences in mortality have begun to decrease in the industrialized countries due to decreasing sex differences in several behaviors which have contributed to men's higher mortality in the past. The rise in smoking among women and their increased participation in the labor force have been cited as two possible interrelated processes contributing to this development (Waldron, 1993).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Unlike previous studies, such as those of Waldron's (1993) and Gee and Veevers' (1988), our investigation is not based on changing sex ratios in mortality, but with the changing sex differential in life expectancy at age zero over the interval from the early 1970's to the early 1990's. Our approach conveniently summarizes the mortality experience of the sexes over the complete age span as opposed to only the mortality ratios of target age groups. A desirable feature of our procedure is that life expectancy is a standardized measure of survival which

takes into account age and sex compositional differences across societies. In another section of our analysis we examine the association of age-sex specific changes in death rates to the amount of variance explained in the dependent variable in order to infer the relative importance of changes in sex mortality differences within age groups to the narrowing of the sex differential in longevity at age zero.
In addition to covering a roughly twenty-year span of observations, and a more recent end point of analysis, we examine a larger set of industrialized countries (38 as opposed to 22 as in the case of Waldron's study, and only one in the case of Gee and Veevers's) comprising both East and West European nations, the USSR, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Israel. These societies are diverse in terms of their histories, cultures, and social structures, but are commonly related by virtue of their industrialized economies and their being in the advanced stages of demographic and epidemiological transitions.
We investigate three questions: The first deals with the association of men and women's changes in life expectation over time to convergence in life expectancy at age zero. We hypothesize that in countries where there is evidence of convergence, this is mostly a function of men's greater rates of improvement in life expectancy over the roughly twenty-year interval from 1970 to 1990. We base this prediction on the assumption that in the industrialized world female life expectation may be approaching a plateau in terms of its rate of gain, whereas men, by virtue of their lower levels of life expectancy,

still have considerable room for further improvements.
A second objective is to study the association between country levels of socioeconomic development (as measured by GNP in US dollars; Population Reference Bureau, 1994, 1975), and the amount of convergence in life expectancy between men and women in the industrialized world. We surmise that convergence should be more pronounced in the most advanced nations of the world. We do not have data to test for the many mechanisms involved in this relationship, but we assume that countries in the advanced stages of epidemiologic and demographic transitions have social and economic structures that might be conducive to a narrowing of the long-established sex differential in life expectation. Our sense is that a large part of this new phenomenon is related to changes in life styles among men and women in recent decades, particularly in the adult working ages.
Therefore, if behavioral factors are germane to the phenomenon under investigation, as has been suggested by a number of authors (e.g., Nathanson, 1992; Waldron, 1993, 1990; Gee and Veevers, 1983; Veevers and Gee, 1986), important mortality changes should be noticed for those in the age range from young adulthood to late middle age. Thus, a third aspect of this study is to explore this possible relationship by examining changes in agesex-specific death rates over time and their association with changes in life expectancy.
DATA
Country data for the periods around 1970 and 1990 with respect to sex-

specific life expectancies at age zero, as well as corresponding age-sex-specific death rates (ages 0-15, 15-24, 25-59, 60 + , and 85 + ) were compiled from published tables in the United Nations Demographic Yearbooks (1993,1992). A more refined classification of agespecific death rates is not available from the published tabulations in the Yearbooks.1
We tried as much as possible to include data for the same two periods consistently--that is, for 1970 and 1990--but for some countries the observations are one or two years prior to or after these time points; and on a number of occasions, the information for the most recent time point is for the early to mid 1980's (see Table 1), thus making it impossible to incorporate into our statistical analysis an intervening period of observation (i.e., for the early 1980's) between the two principal end points.2
MEASUREMENT
A variety of numerical methods could be applied to examine the phenomenon under investigation, but after a careful overview of the alternatives, we decided that the most appropriate and straightforward measure for
1The 1992 and 1993 United Nations Demographic Yearbooks contain the most exhaustive listing of life expectancy by sex for the nations of the world. These sources also contain data on age-sexspecific death rates; however, the age groupings are not as refined as we would have liked. Notwithstanding this limitation, the classification provided sufficient information to allow us to execute an adequate investigation of the phenomenon.
2The countries for which data do not correspond closely to 1970 are Bulgaria (1975), Iceland and Malta (1973). The nations for which data do not correspond closely to 1990 are Scotland (1985), USSR (1986), West Germany (1986), Northern Ireland (1983), Luxembourg (1986), and Republic of Ireland (1986).

our purposes is the second-order difference of period-specific differences in male and female life expectations at age zero. This measure can be shown as follows:
A«0<« = f 0(D - mOt« (1) ety2) (2) A'OCD (3)
where A'W1) and Ac0(2) represent symbols for sex difference in life expectancy at age zero for the periods around 1970 (time point 1) and 1990 (time point 2), respectively; and the letters m and/pertain to males and females. Equation (3) provides a simple measure of change over time. A negative value would indicate a narrowing of the sex gap in survival, while a positive value would denote the opposite development. Within these two possible outcomes we can also take note of the degree of convergence or divergence in the change in the sex differential in survival between the two time points under observation.
RESULTS
Table 1 lists in rank order the amount of convergence or divergence in the sex gap in survival for 38 industrialized nations between two points in time, covering roughly a twenty-year interval between 1970 and 1990 (specific points of observations for each country are shown in parentheses). Hong Kong shows a reduction in its gender gap in longevity by --1.85 years, which happens to be the largest change among the countries in this analysis. This reduction is followed by the countries of Iceland (--1.32), Austria (-0.63), United States (-0.60), Scotland and the United Kingdom

(both with values of -0.59), Canada (-0.49), Australia (-0.37), Finland (-0.27), USSR (-0.26), New Zealand (-0.03) and Switzerland (-0.02).
Among the countries with positive values in our measure of the changing sex gap in average length of life, some of them display larger divergences than others, indicating that over time they have experienced a greater degree of expansion in female advantage in longevity over males. This tendency can be demonstrated with the examples of Hungary, Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, Spain, and Yugoslavia, where the differential widened by a range of 2.81 (Hungary) to 1.04 years (Yugoslavia). At the other end of this continuum, the difference grew to only 0.19, 0.18, and 0.14 in the cases of Israel, Norway, and West Germany, respectively.
A number of patterns can be discerned from Table 1: (1) Among the nations with positive values in their changing sex differences in life expectancy, the largest gaps appear to be typical of Eastern European countries, with the notable exception of the USSR, where as indicated earlier, a narrowing has occurred. (2) Of those nations with positive differences between values of 1.00 and 0.14, with the exception of Japan, all are situated in Europe. (3) With the exceptions of Hong Kong and the USSR, all nations displaying a narrowing of their sex differentials are either in Western Europe or in North America.
These tendencies suggest that country differences in the level of socioeconomic development may be related to the degree and direction of change over time in the sex gap in life expectation. In this regard, it is not surpris-

ing that the largest divergences tend to prevail among therelatively less affluent nations of Eastern Europe, while the largest convergences tend to occur in some ofthe most wealthy societies of the world.

We correlated the life expectancies of men andwomen across all societies in theearly and later periods of observation, separately, with the dependent variable. The zero-order association was -0.24 (p =0.11) when the male

expectancies in period one (i.e., around 1970) were entered as the independent variable. The correlation becomes significant and increases to -0.54 (p < 0.01) when female life expectancies in the early period were substituted as the independent variable. Thus, societies with relatively high female life expectancies at the beginning of the study period (around 1970) are more likely to experience larger reductions in their sex differences in life expectation over time.
When the two sets of sex-specific life expectancies around 1990 are put into the analysis, the resulting correlation goes up to -0.60 (p < 0.01) if the male expectancy is the independent variable; and it is -0.57 (p<0.01) if female expectation is treated as the predictor variable.
We recognize that the dependent variable (second-order difference) is a linear combination of the four life expectancies used in the above correlational analysis: Two of the life expectancies have been added and two of the remaining life expectancies are subtracted from the sum to obtain the second-order difference (i.e., AA<2>~(1) = /e0(2> -m*0W - / « O « + fWOCD). Consequently, in our analysis we could expect some positive and some negative correlations. As shown above, all four correlations are negative, thereby indicating that as life expectancy increases (male or female), the secondorder difference decreases. This finding may also mean that the sex difference in longevity itself can be a nonlinear function of expectation of life.
As shown in Table 2, we also computed zero-order correlations between period-specific male and female life ex-

pectancies and the dependent variable for only those 12 countries that display a narrowing of the sex gap in longevity. Again, all the correlations are negative, but smaller in magnitude in comparison to the ones computed earlier for all the countries combined. As was true of the previous correlational analysis, the male coefficients become more pronounced over time than do those of females (i.e., the male coefficient increased from -0.172 to --0.403, while that of females went up from -0.285 to -0.303).
Another set of correlations in Table 2 involves those countries with positive differences in the dependent variable. The corresponding coefficients in the table are larger in magnitude than in the previous analyses. Both genderspecific coefficients tend to increase in magnitude over time, but the male one increased more and is the larger one in the later period of observation. This pattern of results suggests that there is considerable variability in the extent of change in the sex gap in longevity within those nations where the direction of change is still positive. That is, where the gender gap is widening, some countries are experiencing less divergence than others. Stated differently, in those nations where the second-order difference is positive, the higher the male or female life expectancy in either early 1970's or early 1990's, the lower is the degree of divergence in the male/female gap in survival.
Noteworthy is the fact that in both groups of nations the male coefficients increased more over time than those corresponding to females. This finding suggests support for the notion that it may be the temporal change in male

variable. The contribution of female life expectancy around 1990 to explaining the dependent variable is slightly lower, with an R2 of 0.330. Therefore, level of male expectancy in around 1990 is slightly more important in predicting convergence in survival.
Equations (5) and (6) assess which gender-specific change in expectation of life accounts for more of the variance in the dependent variable. As shown in the table, the change in male expectancy is more important than the corresponding change in female life expectancy. Moreover, the male regression coefficient is larger than that of females' (b = -0.306 vs. -0.105), and the associated R2 is also greater (0.389 vs. 0.028). The female equation fails to reach statistical significance.
In Table 3 Equations (7) to (9) have positive intercepts and negative slopes, which implies that the change in sex difference is positive (i.e., sex difference increases) at lower levels of the independent variable (GNP or change in log of GNP), and becomes negative (i.e., sex difference decreases) at higher levels of the predictor variable. In general, a rise in GNP is associated with a reduction in the sex gap in longevity, as denoted by the negative regression coefficients for both the period around 1970 and 1990. Equations (7) and (8) show that the GNP's of periods one and two, respectively, explain 29 and 51 per cent of the variation in the dependent variable, whereas Equation (9) indicates that the larger the gain in GNP (expressed as change in its natural logarithm) over time, the larger the degree of convergence in the sex gap in longevity (b = --0.841, R2 = 0.382).

Equation (10) considers both GNP around the early 1990's and change in male life expectancy over time simultaneously for their independent contributions to explaining cross-national changes in the survival gap between the sexes. These two variables emerged as the most powerful predictors in previous regressions, thus justifying their inclusion in Equation (10).
The presence of outliers was examined by calculating the residuals, and none of the countries showed values outside of the range of three standard deviations. Both variables are statistically significant and explain 57 per cent of the variance in the dependent variable. It would appear, therefore, that an important condition for reducing the male disadvantage in longevity in the industrialized world would be a significant rise in national levels of GNP. A critical mechanism in this relationship may be the GNP's positive association with male improvements in life style (e.g., reduction in smoking and increased exercise) and also in the availability and access to good health care (Waldron, 1993). The more prosperous and socially advanced is the nation, the more likely that men will benefit from further developments in health care because the gains in survival for women in such countries may have already reached close to a maximum; consequently, men have more to gain from any improvements in health care. One may also hypothesize that in the most advanced nations, a recent consequence of changing gender roles is that women have been increasing their levels of tobacco consumption; and this changing behavioral difference may be of some relevance in re-

ducing the gender gap in life expectancy by virtue of raising female death rates from lung cancer (Waldron, 1993).
It would seem unlikely that all age groups would contribute equally to the changing sex differential in survival. In recent years scholars have observed that the elderly have made gains in survival probabilities (Stone and Fletcher, 1986; Fries, 1980; Mantón, 1982; Olshansky and Ault, 1986; Olshansky et al., 1990; Olshansky and Carnes, 1994; Crimmins et al., 1994). It has also been indicated that men and women in their middle ages have made notable gains in survival (Levi, 1981; Myers, 1989; Rothenberg and Koplan, 1990; Olshansky and Carnes, 1994).
Therefore, most of the observed narrowing in the sex gap across the twelve nations in Table 1 may turn out to be a function of decreasing sex differences in mortality at the older ages and possibly within the interval between the young adulthood years and retirement age. It is also possible that a narrowing in life expectancy at age zero may result as a function of relatively larger male reductions in infant mortality over the time interval being considered. Clearly, if this last condition is a factor, it would preclude gender role type explanations for the phenomenon being investigated.
In Table 4, we show three equations involving the dependent variable regressed on the change in male/female age-specific death rates between the early 1970's and the early 1990's. In comparison to the previous analysis, the number of countries is reduced to 33 (as opposed to 38) due to unavailability of appropriate data concerning

age-sex-specific death rates for five nations in Table 1. In Equation (2), we substitute the death rate for age 60 + with that corresponding to 85+ in order to assess better the possible importance of change in the sex mortality difference in old age mortality on the narrowing of the sex differential in life expectancy at age zero.3
As in our preceding analyses, we rely on OLS regression, and the interpretation of parameters is made in relation to the nation as the unit of analysis. Thus, a given coefficient measures the relative effect of male/female differences in the amount of change in age-specific death rates (per 1,000 population) on the dependent variable, thus allowing us to answer the substantive question of which age group or groups show the strongest association with the dependent variable. A positive coefficient would indicate that the age-specific difference in the rate of change in death rate between men and women is related to a divergence in the male/female difference in life expectancy at age zero, which is the same as saying that males in comparison to females in a given age class have made relatively lower improvements over time in reducing their mortality risk. A negative coefficient would indicate that the effect of a differential rate of change in age-specific mortality serves to reduce the sex gap in life expectation over time, and that therefore men would be making larger improvements
3Out of the 38 countries listed in Table 1, five nations (Albania, Northern Ireland, Romania, Scotland, and USSR) had to be excluded from this part of the analysis because data on death rates by age groups were unavailable in the data sources.

changing sex mortality differential within this age group alone accounts for 67 per cent of the variance in the dependent variable (total variance explained is 72 per cent).
It appears that a significant part of the observed convergence in the gender gap in longevity in recent decades can be accounted for by the differential speed at which the sexes have been reducing their respective mortality rates within the young adulthood to latemiddle-age span; that is, between ages 25 and 59. This is the age range within which industrial nations vary significantly in explaining the narrowing of sex variance in survival: Countries where males in this age range have made faster gains in reducing their death risk in comparison to females experience a larger degree of convergence in the survival gap than in those nations where males have been less successful in making mortality improvements within the age range of 25-59.
A question worth posing is whether across countries the male/female difference in age-specific rates of mortality reductions vary by level of GNP. Table 5 concerns itself with three bivariate regressions involving three different measures of GNP as predictors of the male/female change in agespecific death rates over time. As displayed in the table, country variations in GNP explain a relatively small part of the sex difference in the rate of change in age-specific mortality. This finding is true irrespective of whether GNP is measured at the beginning of the study period or at the end. The only case where GNP seems to make any real difference is in connection with the explanation of sex differences

in death rates in the age group 25-59, where the amount of variance explained ranges from 19 per cent in the period around 1970, to 51 per cent in the later period; and 41 per cent of the variability is explained if the predictor is the temporal change in GNP (i.e., LN(GNP, Í2/GNP, il).
The results indicate that for 25-59 year olds, the effect of raising GNP would serve to decrease men's death rates faster than those of females within this age range (b = 0.833 and 0.793 at time points one and two, respectively). Moreover, a rise in a nation's GNP over time is associated with greater benefits for men in reducing mortality risk (b = 0.984). The data also indicate that if nations had relatively high levels of GNP at the beginning of the study period, men aged 60 and older would experience larger declines in mortality in relation to women (b = 2.342, r = 0.29). On the other hand, the opposite is suggested among those aged 85 + , where male gains have occurred at a slower pace (b = -10.38, r = -0.26); however, these last two effects are only marginally significant in statistical terms
CONCLUSIONS
Since the early 1970's or so, the industrialized world has witnessed the beginning of an unprecedented narrowing of the long-established sex differential in survival. When exactly this trend began is not possible to identify as some countries started earlier and some later, but it is clear that around the early part of the 1970's, some nations were approaching an apex in their sex gaps in longevity, and by the early

change in sex differences in mortality rates among 0-14 year olds to the dependent variable; and there emerged only a weak and marginally significant contribution of such differential at ages 60 and above. Of course, this finding does not in any way refute the fact that within many industrialized nations old age mortality has improved. Indeed, there is evidence that this is the case (Mantón, 1982; Nagnur, 1990; Myers, 1989; Olshansky and Ault, 1986; Olshansky et al., 1991; Krishnan, 1992). What we are saying is that the differences across countries with respect to sex variation in mortality in old age do not appear to be statistically relevant in explaining a narrowing of the sex gap in survival at age zero across industrialized societies.
What implications can be drawn from our results? Earlier, we advanced the notion that recently the industrialized world may have entered a new phase of epidemiological evolution. This proposition will undoubtedly receive further attention, but at this point it is clear that for a significant number of industrialized nations there is now evidence of a reversal in the long-established trend in the sex differential in survival. This situation seems to be permanent and is not likely the result of data errors. The phenomenon has occurred in some of the most advanced nations of the world, which are known to possess excellent vital statistics registration and systems of data collection. This phenomenon has taken place in not one or two countries, but in at least twelve, making it difficult to accept the hypothesis that the observed development is solely a function of vagaries in the data. In the

next several decades more industrial nations will likely witness the onset of convergence in the sex gap in life expectancy.
It appears that several demographic and epidemiological conditions must prevail for an advanced society to witness a narrowing of its gender differential in survival: (1) The society must have completed its demographic and epidemiological transitions as specified in the classic statements of these theories (cf., Omran, 1971). (2) The nation must be either within or about to embark on its fourth stage of epidemiological evolution as delineated by Olshansky and Ault (1986). (3) The country must have already attained relatively high levels of life expectancy, particularly among females, such that women within the society are fast approaching a plateau in terms of further potential gains in life expectation (cf., Fries, 1980; Olshansky et al., 1990). (4) There must be a high level of female emancipation, as reflected in such trends as their high rates of higher education, labor force participation, prolonged level of low or belowreplacement fertility, rising age at marriage, increased propensities to enter common-law unions, and high divorce probabilities. (5) There must have occurred in the recent past some convergence in gender-based behaviors, which in many cases would be highly associated with female emancipation.
These conditions are either implicitly or explicitly assumed, in some of the recent literature on sex differences in mortality. For example, researchers have hypothesized that as women increase their levels of labor force participation toward those of men and

34

approximate the same occupational distribution, they will begin to experience similar patterns of mortality (Waldron, 1990; Pampel and Zimmer, 1989; Passannante and Nathanson, 1985; Hazuda et al., 1986; Bouvier-Colle, 1983). Others have added that in recent decades women have been increasingly taking on "masculine" roles and, as such, may soon start to approximate a correspondingly "masculine" configuration of death (Gee and Veevers, 1983;Veevers and Gee, 1986; Waldron, 1993). Furthermore, it has been argued that the sex gap in death rates has begun to narrow in the industrialized world partly due to women's adoption of several behaviors which have contributed to men's higher mortality in the past. The rise of smoking among women and the concomitant reduction of tobacco use among men during the past few decades is an example of this trend (Nathanson, 1992). Women may also be consuming more alcohol than in previous times. Also, with their increased independence and affordability due to their labor force participation, women are driving more and hence more likely to be involved in fatal motor vehicle accidents (Veevers and Gee, 1976).
In societies where these trends have been prevailing a minimum value for the sex differential in life expectancy at age zero should eventually attain. What that minimum difference will be and when it will take place is open to speculation, however. We surmise that women will always enjoy one to two additional years of life expectancy over males; and it would seem highly unlikely that men will ever attain parity with women. Even in high mortality conditions, such as during the early

stages of epidemiological transition, when society was relatively devoid of good systems of health care and had relatively low standards of living, the differential in life expectation favored women by about two to three years. This assertion can be verified in part by the Coale and Demeny (1983) model life tables at the highest mortality levels, where indeed the sex gap in life expectancy at infancy is in this vicinity. It would seem likely that a two to three year gap may represent a natural lower limit for the amount of eventual convergence in the male/female gap in longevity.
Our analysis suggests that if the prevailing rates of convergence in the twelve nations identified in this research remain constant over time, two countries can expect their sex gaps in longevity to reach this presumed minimum difference within the next four decades. Those countries are Hong Kong and Iceland. For the remaining ten nations, this outcome will necessarily take longer due to their presently lower levels of convergence. Further work in the area of mortality projections will have to take into account this new reality and appropriate parameters for the sex gap in longevity will have to be introduced into the computations.
From a theoretical point of view, the evidence presented in this study is not inconsistent with the thesis proposed by Rogers and Hackenberg (1991). They argue that the industrialized nations of the world have in recent years entered the "Hybristic" stage of epidemiological transition, whereby the morbidity and mortality patterns of men and women are now largely a function of individual behaviors and
