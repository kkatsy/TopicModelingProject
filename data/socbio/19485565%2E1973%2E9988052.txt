In the case of schizophrenia, the restriction thus imposed limits therange of possible solutions to gene frequencies between approximately 0.06 and 0.15. In this range all solutions are equally acceptable. Thus, a single gene two allele model can fit the data. If a single locus is involved, the gene frequency must be in the neighborhood of q = 0.10 (with range 0.06-0.15 by James' approach). A very similar range of solutions was found with our

allow unique solutions for the single-diallelicgene model on traits in which the affected are subdivided into two degrees of severity. It may help in distinguishing between the polygenic and the one gene, two allele model. Obviously, the two thresholds must be sufficiently sharp to allow accurate diagnosis. However, with two thresholds, a three-allele model and a two-diallelic-loci model may still leave a probably wide range of ambiguity.
Smith (1971) has given a method and a program for predicting risks in matings according to the polygenic hypothesis. This is an alternative method to those we have introduced: Monte Carlo and direct evaluation of the tetrachoric correlation. The relative cost in computer time to obtain equal accuracy for the two methods has not been determined. Numerical integration with a small number of intervals in Smith's program may be unsatisfactory

when incidences are small. The graphs relating incidence and correlation given by Smith (1970) and by Reich et al. (1972) are virtually identical to results obtained using the original tetrachoric correlation expansion to 50 terms (Kidd and Cavalli-Sforza, unpublished) although the illustrations they give are either limited to or only accurate for general incidences below 20%.
