Corporal development of the children

Out of about one million young children who attend the nearly 10,000 public schools in Greece,1 a sample of 6,254 pupils was examined in 110 localities from all major geographic regions of the country (Table 1). A team of investigators, comprised of at least one medical doctor, university assistant, and one nurse, visited each school during its regular day program and with the consent and cooperation of the school master examined all children

in the sample (Table 2) appears at a muchimproved level with respect to that during the war or the pre-war periods (Valaoras, 1946, p. 226-227). Compared with corresponding data of 1927-28, the average boy or girl of this series was taller by 6.1 cm. but the average body weight was somewhat lighter. Compared with another sample taken during the war years 194243, gains are consistent in both stature ( + 3 . 5 cm.) and weight ( + 1 . 6 kg.). Although the series are not entirely com-

·Dividing line between urban-rural localities was a population of over or under 1,000 in the 1961 census. For urban-rural analysis the marginal ages_ (5th and 13th year) were omitted, because the numbers were small. The remainder (3,074 boys and 2,736 girls) were about equally divided between urban and rural localities. The standard deviation was around 6.5 cm for stature, 4.0 kg for the weight and 1.8 mm for the skinfold. Significance of the differences were checked by the criterion x/tr. It was low (no significant difference) for height and weight between boys and girls of the same age, but for the skinfold it was highly significant (103). In the comparison between urban-rural, all three variables differed significantly, with an x/tr = 42 for stature, x/<r = 26 for weight, and si a = 60 for the skinfold.

betterment of the standards of nutrition and level of living of the general population (see Figure 1). Children are better fed now than they were before the war, universal schooling is totally enforced, and the introduction to the curriculum of phys-

ical and athletic exercises tends to promote the lineal growth and the muscular development, thus leading to taller final stature and more robust adult bodies. On the thickness of the layer of the subcutaneous fat, there are no previous observations for

comparison, but our finding corroborates the known fact that female bodies accumulate more fat under the skin than males of the same age. In this study measurements were made by means of a standard anthropometer (Gneupel-Suisse) and a skinfold caliper (Johnbull-England). Height and body weight of children was taken without shoes and with the minimum underwear clothing; skinfold, at the (dorsal) interscapular region.
Geographic variations do occur, the tallest and heaviest children being those living in Attica and other cities of Central Greece, while Thessaly and Epirus yielded the smallest specimens. That this is due to socioeconomic differentials and particularly to the status of the child's nutrition becomes evident from the urban-rural analysis shown in Table 2. Data from villages with a population (in 1961) of up to 1,000 persons (rural) were matched at about equal numbers with those residing in larger localities (urban = 1,000 +)> and the aggregate finding puts a clear disadvantage to the former. Village school children were on the average 5.5 cm. shorter, their body weight was less by 2.85 kg., and their skinfold was only about half as thick as in those living in the apparently more prosperous towns and cities. Since the annual increment for children in this age group amounts to about 4 cm. in height and to about 2.2 kg. in body weight, it follows that rural pupils of the sample were lagging behind their urban colleagues by more than one age year in terms of their corporal development.
In an attempt to measure the approximate health standard, each child of the sample was first given a cursory ten-minute medical examination and then a short account of the past medical history was taken. Only the most obvious departures from the normal were recorded during

the medical examination, and a summary of frequencies observed (expressed as a per cent of the total examined for each symptom) is given in Table 3. There was

little and rather random age and sex variability in the frequencies observed. Though most of these abnormalities were classified as "minor" and all diagnoses were to be verified later by the family physician, the rather heavy prevalence (amounting to a little over two defects per child) casts some doubts about the efficiency of the public health services and medical care practices, especially in the rural areas, where the frequencies of defects were about twice as high as those in the urban centers.
Village children were also shorter and lighter in weight, a clear sign of an unbalanced diet and/or chronic malnutrition. As to the breakfast they had before coming to school that day, the majority of responses in the rural areas varied between "nothing" or "bread alone" or "bread and tea or coffee," in contrast to the town or city children who reported "milk" or

"cheese" or "eggs" and "fruits" together with their breakfast bread.
There is no general shortage of physicians in the country (1.4 doctors per 1,000 persons in 1965), but most of them are serving the urban population which amounts to about 45% of the total. Public health services are also scanty in rural areas and a School Health Officer seldom, if ever, visits the remote village schools. A gradual build-up of an efficient School Health Service, covering the entire body of the school population of the country, with periodic medical examination would render quick and sizable returns in terms of wholesome health and sound corporal development of the new generation.

STUDENT'S SURVEY, 1961-1968
In conformity with the university study program, undergraduate students in the fourth year of the six-year medical school and those in the third year (out of five years) of its dentistry branch are required to work in the Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology for about 80 hours during the academic year. All the students who took this course during the seven academic years (1961-62 to 1967-68) were examined by the professor and his staff, and the following information has been entered into

The analysis yielded several interesting findings, the most relevant being as follows:
SIZE AND ATTRIBUTES OF THE SAMPLE
Table 4 gives the numbers examined in each academic year by sex and school.2 With an annual average of 553 students in medicine and 134 in dentistry the numbers seem rather high in relation to both the total body of students in this university (21% of those in corresponding year of study) and the respective needs of the country (680 persons per physician in 1965). They also exceed the teaching capacity of the medical school (26 professors with an average of 4 assistants each)3 and are on the increase, in spite of the growing evidences of an overcrowded medical profession and the loss of about two hundred holders of the medical degree per year to foreign emigration.
The sex and age distribution is given in Table 5. The variables in Tables 5-8 are given for all students by sex because there was so little difference between medical and dental students. Female participation in the sample amounts to 23.0% for the medical students and to 53.5% for those in dentistry. The skewness of the distribution in the age scale calls for some explanation. Under the existing system of public education, entrance to the six year

elementary school program is required at the age between five and six years. High school takes another six-year period. Consequently, those seeking admission in a university school are in about their eighteenth year, and the present sample should have been piled up at the ages between the twenty-second and twenty-third year. The fact that 36% of the students were older than that limit (the oldest student in the sample was 47 years old) indicates that several years were lost during the preceding period of formal education.
Due to the leniency of the system, those who fail in the annual examinations are allowed to try again and again in subsequent years until they finally manage to pass, even if it has to be at a very low level. In this way the proportion of dropouts is minimized, but time and money are profusely wasted and the principle of the selection of an intellectual elite for which higher education should be reserved is seriously breached. However, this seems to apply mostly to male students, since the great majority of girls (94% versus 78% for males) were in the age bracket below twenty-five.
Younger as they are on the average, female students seem to fare better, if judgment is to be passed on the final high school grade, just before they were ad-

All passing marks from 11 to 20 are represented in this sample; but those at the top with "excellent" or "good" performance (Grade 17 and over) comprise 53% among girls but only 27% among boys (Table 6). With an average grade of 15.9 for males and of 17.1 for females, about one half of the former, but only one fifth of the latter, would have been denied admission if recruitment to the medical school were to be restricted among the best candidates available (those above average).
In another criterion, that of the study of foreign languages, female students score again better with a proportion of 78% (against 70% for males) knowing one or more foreign languages (Table 7). English is the most preferred additional language (59% among those who speak a foreign

language), which is followed by French (27%), German (9%), and Italian (4%). Only national students (N = 3,493) were included in this and the following analyses.
ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS
Table 8 gives the average height and body weight of the students by sex, in two age groups, namely those below and those above age 25. Younger students are somewhat taller, but older students are definitely heavier, an indication of the peculiar time trend followed by these two variables. Putting on excess weight as one gets older is a common phenomenon in the Western world, but the shorter stature of older students can be accounted for only by retracing events which occurred during their childhood. Born during the war or postwar period and exposed to many deprivations, the older students of the sample seem to have lost some of their "normal" stature, which otherwise would have been attained in adulthood. A curtailment of at least 1.5 cm. was observed in the average stature of army conscripts (Valaoras, 1970a) as a result of such adverse living conditions, but the fact that male students are by about 5 cm. taller than the soldiers of the same age indicates that this sample must have been of a highly selective origin. It appears that university students in Greece are mostly recruited from the mid-

die and upper social strata, among which environmental factors (such as better than average living and nutritional standards) result in a better corporal development in comparison with that of the general population.
The size and the shape of the head (cephalometry) was established by taking the two main axes of the head of the students, the average size of which, by sex, was as follows (in cm.).

The female head is a little smaller than male, but the resulting distribution of the sample in the scale of the cephalic index is almost identical for the two sexes. In its combined form the distribution (given in Table 9) shows the majority with a broadroundish head, and only a few (10%) belonging to the group of dolichocephalics. This seems to be in agreement with observations made in many European populations, in which an evolutionary trend towards brachycephalism was depicted.4

Thus, the percentage of the population that is brachycranial . . . is: Sweden: modern 13%, Iron and Middle Ages, 3% to 7%; Denmark: modern, 33%, Iron Age, 2%; Slavs: modern, 85%, 6th to 12th century, 9%; Greeks: modern, 54%, Classic, 10%; Crete: modern, 38%, Minoan, 9%" (Kroeber, 1948, p. 128).

* Blue or green eyes may be combined as 22.2% (university students) and 22.8% (elementary school children).

The pigmentation of the eye was found to run through the entire scale, from light blue to completely dark irises, as shown in Table 10. It is signficant that both surveys under review yielded almost identical results in this respect, with a sizable proportion (22%) in the light shades of blueand green colors and very few with extremely dark eyes. The distribution of the sample in accordance with ABO blood groups (Table 11) is similar to that obtained from a large sample of soldiers born in south-central Greece, i.e., the area from which the students of the University of Athens are mostly drawn. The rather high proportion (95.5%) of Rhesus positive individuals corroborates previous findings on the same population.

BIOSOCIAL BACKGROUND
The average student, with a mean age of 22.9years, is usually (48.5%) the first child of a family composed of 3.05 children. The age of his (living) father is about

57 years and that of his mother, 50 years. Orphanhood among students was quite prevalent (15%), most of which is attributed to the loss of the father (11%), but in a few cases (about 1%) to the loss of both parents. No case of divorced parents wasreported in this sample. The average size of the parent's families was significantly larger (father's family with 4.85 children, mother's family with 4.60), a telling evidence of the secular decline of fertility in this country.
Seen from the socioeconomic point of view, the families who choose to send at least one of their children to study medicine or dentistry are certainly not typical ofthe general population. It seems that the lower socioeconomic strata, as may be defined by the profession or the educational level of parents, are grossly underrepresented in the sample, which is mostly made up of families with medium to high income and with more than average educational status. Though comparisons with the 1961population census returns tend to exaggerate somewhat the differences (the census counts "persons" while the family is the unit in this sample), the mere fact that the population engaged in agriculture amounted to over 50% of the male labor force in 1961, but provided only 14% of the students in the sample, is quite indicative of the prevailing patterns. Most of the students are the sons of fathers inthe high professional ranks (33%) or of public functionaries (21%) or of merchants (20%), and only few of them manage to emerge from the more populous classes of farmers or laborers.
A similar trend is depicted in Table 12, where the fathers of the sample andthe male population (10 years and over) of the 1961 census are distributed in accordance with their level of education. Those with a university degree contribute almost 13 times more students than their share
