ABSTRACT: The analyses shown here indicate that the pervasiveness of fertility trends found earlier for the 1950's and 1960's has continued for the 1970's. The national period fertility trends have occurred within every racial, social, and economic subgroup examined. As before, there is no evidence of a narrowing of fertility differentials within successive cross-sections. Variables, such as race or education, continue to exert effects on cross-sectional fertility differences. Standard socioeconomic variables operate to shift the entire trend line up or down, but do not explain the trend line. The question remains of what causes changes in period fertility rates in developed societies.

Since World War II, period fertility results, the answer is that the fertility

who have been born to the women, but also children who have been adopted, and stepchildren which the mother acquired by marrying the father of the child. The fraction of all children who are living with their mothers (or stepmothers) is very high and is similar in the data sets used here. In Table 1 we provide measures of the fraction of children, by age and race, who are living with their mothers. The fraction of children living with their mothers is larger at all ages for whites in 1976than 1970.The differences are generally in the range of 0.8 to 1.5 percentage points higher in 1976 and tend to be larger at the older ages than the younger ages. At each age up to 12, 97 per cent of children are living with their mothers. For nonwhites, there is also a tendency for this fraction to increase, particularly at ages 5 and beyond. At ages 0 and 1, the fraction of nonwhite children living with their mothers decreased.
The population coverage of the decennial census of 1970 and the 1976 SIE

is slightly different. The SIE, like the Current Population Survey, does not include the institutional population. The increased fraction of children living with their mothers may be due in part to the exclusion of the institutional population from the SIE. The fraction of children in group quarters, most of whom are in institutions, in 1970 is shown in Table 2. The difference in coverage probably does not account for more than half of the increase between 1970 and 1976.
The count of own children excludes any children who may have died or

moved away and are thus not living with the mother. In addition, the validity of own-child fertility measurement depends on the completeness of enumeration of both mothers and children by age, and the survival of mothers and children to the time of the interview.
In our earlier study we made several attempts to evaluate these own children data. In general, we found that rates produced in this manner track the annual change in fertility (as measured in the Vital Statistics system) quite well, but there is a scale difference. The rates computed by the own-child methodology tend to be lower by a relatively constant proportion within a given social group when compared to the vital statistics rates. However, the proportion varies among groups. For example, the differential is larger for blacks than it is for whites. For purposes of comparison across groups, restriction to marital fertility in recent years minimizes the scale differences.
In many respects, the 1976 Survey of Income and Education (SIE) and the Current Population Survey (CPS) are miniature versions of the decennial census. In general, a similar set of questions was asked of persons in the March CPS's, the 1976 SIE, and the decennial censuses. There are differences, however. The censuses, of course, are a complete enumeration, while the SIE and CPS are sample surveys. The interviewers used to conduct SIE and CPS are professional interviewers who have considerable training and experience in the conduct of household enumeration. In most areas of the United States, the 1970 Census was conducted not by an enumerator, but rather by a procedure of self-enumeration in which the individual respondent filled in and returned the census form without the involvement of a census enumerator. Thus,

there is the question of whether surveys, like the SIE, can do as good a job of tracking annual trends in fertility among subgroups as censuses.
In order to explore this issue, we computed annual total fertility rates using own children data from the SIE and compared these with rates obtained from the vital registration system. The results are shown in Figure 1 for whites and nonwhites.1 It can be seen that, for both whites and nonwhites, the SIE estimates are below the vital statistics estimates. This is not surprising given such factors as infant mortality or the giving up of children for adoption. Note, however, that for both whites and nonwhites, the same trend estimates are obtained from the SIE series as the vital registration series. This means that the SIE can be used to accurately estimate trends for various subgroups. These are fertility estimates for all women irrespective of their marital status. Since most children who do not live with their mothers are children of women who are not currently married, we can make valid cross-sectional comparisons of recent marital fertility by restricting the sample to currently married women.
A related question is how close are the estimates from the SIE to the estimates from the census. In order to examine this question, we have taken the vital registration estimates as our standard of comparison and related the census and SIE estimates to this standard. The results are shown in Table 3 for the period 1945-1975. Looking first at the averages for each data source, it can be seen that for both whites and nonwhites, the SIE estimates are somewhat closer to the vital registration rates than the
1It should be noted that the SIE estimates have not been adjusted for such factors as infant mortality or undercount. See Rindfuss and Sweet, 1977, Chapter 2 for a fuller discussion of this issue.

census estimates. This may be the result of the SIE relying more heavily on a trained and experienced staff of professional interviewers. For example, when an additional form is needed to list all the members in a large household (e.g., Coale and Rives, 1973), professional interviewers are more likely to use such a form and thus list the younger children in the household.
A second point can be seen from Ta-

ble 3. The annual comparisons of the SIE estimates to thevital registrationestimates tend to vary more from year to year than the comparisons of the censuses. The reason is that the number of cases upon which the SIE estimates are based is substantially smaller than the number of cases upon which the census estimates are based. Similarly, the nonwhite SIE estimates tend to fluctuate more than the white SIE estimates (see

Figure 1), because there are substantially fewer nonwhites than whites. The reason, as Retherford and Bennett (1977) point out, is that "the sample sizes required to keep relative confidence intervals below 10 percent are generally quite large."2 Thus even though the SIE is a large sample by normal social science standards, containing over 100,000 women of childbearing age, it will not be possible to examine annual fertility rates for some of the smaller subgroups as could be done with census data.
At some points in this paper, we also extend our time series past 1975 by using own children estimates from the March CPS's. Because the sample sizes for the CPS's are considerably smaller than for the SIE, whenever the CPS's are used,
2Bean and Swicegood (1982) report similar findings for 1974 and 1975.

estimates will be obtained by pooling data from three adjacent CPS's. When we compared such estimates for 1969 with census estimates for 1969, the two were almost identical, with the CPS estimates being slightly larger as expected.3 Thus, with either the CPS or the SIE surveys it is possible to obtain accurate estimates of period fertility rates, provided the sample sizes are not too small.
RESULTS
Annual total fertility rates for five education groups are plotted in Figure 2.4
3The reader interested in more detail can write to Sweet for a working paper describing comparisons of the census, CPS, and SIE estimates.
4As discussed in Rindfuss and Sweet (1977), the rates for education groups for the two years closest to the census are misleading and thus are not shown here. Further, in both Figures 2 and 3, whenever two valid estimates for the same year were available they were averaged and then plotted.

As can be seen, the pervasiveness that was evident during the 1950's and 1960's has continued into the 1970's. Even though the series is a bit unstable for the two lowest education groups because of the small numbers of women involved, all five groups experienced similar trends, including a substantial decline in fertility levels between the late 1960's and early 1970's.
The per cent decline in fertility between 1967 and 1973for each of the educational groups is:

With the exception of the 5-8 years

group, the relative declines in fertility during this period are essentially identical. Pervasiveness has indeed continued with respect to fertility trends and education.
Similarly, the trends have been ubiquitous across regions. Figure 3shows the trend in fertility since World War II for Southern and non-Southern women. Although there are a few differences (see Rindfuss et al., 1978), both regions overall have experienced similar trends. Both groups experienced substantial declines in the early 1970's.5
In order to examine the trend in fertility during the 1970's among other subgroups, we shift to an alternative fertil-
5Both groups also had a slight decrease in fertility in the late 1960's. This increase was more pronounced among southerners. Examination of more detailed figures shows that it is found among all education groups and is more pronounced among older than younger women.

ity measure; the number of own children aged less than three years among currently-married women. The own children under three measure essentially averages three years of fertility exposure, thus reducing the need for larger samples. The restriction to currently-married women also makes it possible to use own children data toexamine differentials within a crosssection (see Rindfuss and Sweet, 1977, Ch. 2)--an advantage we will utilize in the next section of this paper.6
Further, to extend the time series into the late 1970's we use data from the March Current Population Surveys of 1969-80. In order to obtain sufficient cases to make reliable estimates, we combine samples for 1969-71, 1975-77 and 1978-80--using the middle year to identify the three-year combined sample. These estimates are shown in Table 4 separately for whites and blacks. Also shown in Table 4 are estimates of fertil-

6It needs to be emphasized that the trend and differential estimates that follow only apply to currently married women. During the 1970's the marital status distribution of women in the childbearing ages (18-39) changed considerably:

Total

1969 1974 1980 23 25 30 69 65 57 7 9 12 100 100 100

We refer to our estimates as "marital fertility." That is, strictly speaking, not correct. The reference period is the three years prior to the date of survey. Some women were not married during all of that period and some may have had a nonmarital birth during the period. Other women who were married during the three-year reference period are no longer married. Hence some marital births and some marital exposure to risk is missed. In the absence of marital and birth histories, more "correct" estimates are impossible. We are convinced that these estimates are satisfactory for our purposes. However, age at first marriage, marital disruption, remarriage, and pre- and intermarital births do not occur at random in the population. Some of the differentials reported here may be biased by these processes.

ity change from the Census-SIE comparison for 1970-76. In general, the Census-SIE and the CPS series show similar change patterns, although there are some deviations. We will use the CPS figures in the text.
For white women, fertility fell substantially between 1970and 1976for all subpopulations. The aggregate decline was about 20 per cent. For most subgroups shown, the decline was between 15 and 25per cent. Larger declines were experienced by older women aged 3539 (34 per cent) and for women at parities 2 and beyond (35^0 per cent).7
Between 1976 and 1979 the fertility of white married women rose slightly by2 per cent. For most subgroups, therewas an increase in fertility. For those groups whose fertility continued to decline, the rate of decline was slow in comparison to that experienced in the earlier period. There was an increase in fertility at all ages except age35-39. Thehistorical decline in fertility of women in their late 30's continued. There wasan increase at every education level except for college graduates. Fertility continued to decline at initial parities 1 and 2, reflecting the increased concentration of family size at one and two children. Women with initial parities 0,3, and 4 or more all experienced increased fertility. There was a small decline in fertility in the northeast (4 per cent) and south (1per cent), and a
7Neither the SIE nor the March CPS's asked women the number of children that they had ever borne. As a result, initial parity here had to be defined as the number of own children under age 18 minus the number of own children under age three. In our earlier work, initial parity was defined as the number of children ever born minus the number of own children under three. We were concerned that for older women this might make a considerable difference. To check, the results from the 1970 census were run both ways and it makes essentially no difference to the general pattern of our results.

of marital fertility decline and the slight increase in fertility experienced by most subgroups during the later part of the 1970's.
For black women the overall decline in marital fertility between 1970 and 1976 was 24 per cent. Almost every subgroup shown experienced a decline in fertility. (The one exception--college graduates--appears to be the result of sampling variability, since the 1970 census-1976 SIE estimates for this group show a large decrease in fertility.)8 The declines were concentrated in the 15 to 30 per cent range, with larger declines experienced by women aged 35-39 (43 per cent), women living in nonmetropolitan areas (35 per cent), and women with initial parity of 3 and over (about 45 per cent). Only a very small decline was experienced by women whose husbands earned less than $2,000 (in 1970 dollars).
During the period 1976 to 1979, the rate of decline in black fertility slowed to 3 per cent, compared to a 2 per cent increase for whites. For most subgroups fertility either increased or decreased at a slower rate than during the early 1970's. However, the picture is not nearly as orderly as that for the fertility of white women. Given the comparatively small sample sizes for blacks, this is not surprising. In general, however, the black groups either had an increase in fertility during the latter part of the 1970's or a smaller decrease than was the case during the early part of the 1970's. There can be no doubt that for all of
8The Census-SIE and CPS estimate of fertility change are quite similar for most subgroups. Apart from the black college graduate discrepancy, the other major exceptions are: black women under 20 and black women of parity zero. In both cases the CPS shows a substantial decline, while the censusSIE series shows essentially no change.

these groups--black and white--the latter part of the 1970's marked a transition point for period fertility trends.
CROSS-SECTIONAL DIFFERENCES
To this point we have been examining trends in fertility with various subgroups and have found them to be ubiquitous. Put differently, the standard socioeconomic variables used in various fertility studies do not predict or explain the trend in fertility in the United States during the 35 years we have examined. There is a related question, indeed one which is more typically asked by social demographers: To what extent do these socioeconomic variables produce fertility differentials within a cross-section? In the present section, we examine this question and find that the same variables which did not differentiate with respect to trends produce substantial cross-sectional differences in every cross-section.
Because the concern is with differences in the levels of fertility between groups, the focus is on the number of own children under three for currentlymarried women aged less than 40. The results shown in Table 5 are derived from multiple regression analyses of differential fertility and are "net" differentials, i.e., after controlling for the other factors discussed. The analyses were conducted within each racial group and within each year. The variables included in the model are: education, husband's income in 1960 constant dollars, wife's age, initial parity of the wife, region of residence, and the metropolitan and farm status of her residence.
Among whites, the pattern of differentials observed in 1970 persists almost unchanged in 1976. The higher the level

of education, the lower the fertility in both years. In 1970,there was a continuou» decline of fertility with education, However, by 1976, the fertility of college 13-15 groups is no different than that of the college graduates. The relationship of fertility with husband's income is also very similar in the two years. With the one exception of husband's income of $1000-1999 (in 1960 constant dollars) the two patterns are almost identical with the 1976 rates--
approximately 100 points lower than the

1970 rates at the given income level. In both years there was the characteristic upward slope of fertility on current income. Rindfuss and Sweet (1977, pp. 75-82) present evidence that this positive effect is due to the accelerated childbearing of young couples at the point where their income increases. In short, income has a positive effect on the timing of fertility, but not necessarily on the quantity of fertility,

little. Southern fertility was still the lowest and the northeast and north central regions had almost identical levels, which were considerably higher than fertility in the western region. Exactly why region should be related to fertility is unknown at present. (This issue is discussed at length in Rindfuss, 1978.)

Viewing the past 35 years in their entirety, socioeconomic variables seem to act as "multipliers." That is, standard socioeconomic variables operate to shift the entire trend line up or down, as the case may be.

The analyses shown here indicate that the pervasiveness of fertility trends found earlier for the 1950's and 1960's has continued for the 1970's. The national period fertility trends have occurred within every racial, social, and

What factors then do explain these fluctuations? Despite the fact that there has been some conjecture in the literature, the simple fact is that we do not know.
