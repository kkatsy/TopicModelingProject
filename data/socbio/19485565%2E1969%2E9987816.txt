The counteracting effects of a rising marriage rate and a rising divorce rate during the 1960's1 present several questions, answers to which are sought in this paper: What has been the net change in the proportion of adults currently living in the married state?2 Has the change been the same for young persons as for persons of more mature age? Has the change occurred uniformly among men and women and among white and nonwhite persons? What kind of "indicators" can be devised to summarize the "favorableness" of the observed changes in terms of increasing (or decreasing) marital stability?3
The data in the accompanying tables show the directions and magnitudes of re-

1 The marriage rate for the twelve months ending November 1968 was 10.3 per 1,000 population; the corresponding rate for 1960 was 8.5. The divorce rate per 1,000 population was 2.7 in 1967 as compared with 2.2 in 1960. See National Center for Health Statistics, Monthly Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 17, Nos. 10, 11, 10 supplement, and 11 supplement; also, Marriage Statistics Analysis: United States, 1963, and Divorce Statistics Analysis,1963.
2 Changes in marital status by age and race for the period 1930 to 1960 are featured in Hugh Carter and Paul C. Glick, "Trends and Current Patterns of Marital Status Among Nonwhite Persons," Demography, Vol. 3, No. 1, 1966, p. 276-288.

cent changes in marital status, including substantial increases in the proportion married for some population groups which have been partly offset by decreases in the proportion married for other groups and by an upturn in the proportion divorced among most population groups.
As the findings are presented, the reader may wish to consider the probable reasons for the recent changes in marital status; for example, the proportion married among those below old age has risen partly because couples are surviving jointly for an increasing number of years. But, in addition, the proportion living as bachelors and spinsters has been falling steadily as a larger proportion of the population is becoming financially able and socially free to marry or to remarry according to personal choice while still within the preferred age range for
2This paper is an extension of the analysis presented in a background paper on marriage trends which was prepared at the request of staff members of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare who were in charge of exploring the possibility of assembling "social statistics and indicators" for the nation. Information on "these yardsticks" was issued in January, 1969, as a report from Secretary Wilbur J. Cohen to the President entitled Toward a Social Report. The letter of transmittal states that the report "deals with such aspects of the quality of American life as: health and illness; social mobility; the physical environment; income and poverty; public order and safety; learning, science, and art; and participation and alienation."

marriage. While more people are now divorced, the basic data do not reveal whether this means that more people now have serious marital discord than previously or whether more of those who have serious marital troubles are becoming financially able and socially free to settle those troubles by leaving an intolerable marriage through divorce, and perhaps later entering a tolerable remarriage.
The findings in this study consist of a summary evaluation of recent changes in marital status (by age, color, and sex) in terms of net movement of social groups in "favorable" or "unfavorable" directions according to the proportions single, with marriages intact, with marriages disrupted by separation or divorce, and widowed. The changes are divided into forty components, based on sample data from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, and a judgment is expressed about each component as to whether it represents a favorable or an unfavorable change. Discussion of the judgment factor is given in a later section. The components are identified as the twenty

cells in the third and sixth columns of Table 1 labeled "Change" (excluding the cells for total men and total women) and the twenty corresponding cells in Table 2. Attention is directed first to the steps taken in developing these forty components.
DEVELOPMENT OF COMPONENTS OF CHANGE
Table 1 shows changes in marital status between "1960" and "1965" for persons 18 to 24 years old, and Table 2 shows similar data for persons 25 to 64 years old. These groups were selected for presentation because recent changes in the per cent married have been generally in opposite directions for the younger and older of these two groups. Persons under 18 were omitted from this study because the proportions married are small. However, the general pattern in this very young group was favorable in the sense that it was toward a decline in marriage. Persons 65 and over were omitted because of the small proportion of persons at that age who marry, and the present study

is oriented toward those in the main ages for marriage.
The first step in assembling the data was to combine the published figures from Current Population Reports for five-year periods in order to stabilize the results. As the footnotes on the tables state, the columns labeled "1960" contain data averaged for the five years 1958 to 1962, and those labeled "1965" contain data averaged for the five years 1963 to 1967. A secondary consideration in making these combinations is that none of the children born soon after World War II had reached 18 years of age by 1962, but several million had done so by 1967. A tertiary consideration is the timing of the recent upturn in divorce in the United States; between 1962 and 1967 the number of divorces went up 20% (413,000 to 534,000). After the basic data were combined for the two five-year periods, the distributions for 1960 were standardized for age within each cell of Tables 1, 2, and 5, using 1965 data as the base. The full age detail available was used in this process (18-19,

20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64).
Table 3 shows a number and a direction (up or down) for each of the forty components of change in marital status. The direction stated for each component is the favorable one, and the sign of the number " 1 " in front of it indicates whether the observed change between 1960 and 1965 was or was not in the favorable direction. To illustrate, "1 up" for single white men 18 to 24 years of age means that an upward movement in per cent single for this group (signifying a tendency to delay marriage) was judged to be a favorable change, and the fact that the " 1 " is positive means that the actual observed change between 1960 and 1965 was in the favorable direction. The "0 down" for white men 18 to 24 with marriage intact means that a downward movement for this group was judged to be favorable, but the "0" means that no change took place in the five-year period among these persons (who were married but not separated). And, the " --1 down" for divorced white men 18 to 24

single for young white men rose by 1.1% between 1960 and 1965; since that increase was more than 0.4% and in a favorable direction, it is shown as a positive " 1 " in Table 4.
ANALYSIS OF COMPONENTS OF CHANGE
Fully twenty of the forty components of change in marital status over the last decade, as defined for this study, were interpreted as major changes in a favorable direction, and only six of the forty as major changes in an unfavorable direction. The other fourteen components of change were not classified as major. Within this generally favorable picture, however, some similarities and some very wide differences between findings for white and nonwhite groups are apparent.
Both color groups were alike in that they scored 10 favorable major changes. Among whites, 7 of these 10 changes were conse-

quences of an increasing tendency for white persons to be married; that is, to marry rather than become bachelors or spinsters, to remain married, or to remarry rather than remain widowed or divorced. The other favorable changes for whites consisted of very sharp declines in the per cent separated among young persons (with no compensating major rise in per cent divorced) and a decline of about one-tenth in the per cent widowed among white women 25 to 64. Among nonwhites, 4 of the 10 favorable major changes reflected shifts toward mature adult age at marriage, 2 were for declines in per cent separated among young persons (the same as for whites), 1 for a substantial decline in per cent divorced for nonwhite men 18 to 24, and 3 for sharp declines in per cent widowed.
Five of the six components denoting unfavorable major changes were found among the nonwhites. The only white component

Among nonwhites, 3 of the 5 changes identified as unfavorable--but to be challenged below--were associated with increasing entrance of nonwhite young people into marriage. The other 2 identified as unfavorable--but also to be challenged below--represented substantial increases in the per cent divorced among nonwhite men and women 25 to 64 years old.

When the eight groups by age, color, and sex were compared, young white women ranked highest with 3 favorable and no unfavorable major changes, whereas young nonwhite men ranked lowest with 2 favorable and 2 unfavorable major changes (see Table 7).
The results in Tables 3 and 4 provide a basis for concluding that more major as well as minor changes in marital status between 1960 and 1965 were favorable than unfavorable. They also provide a basis for judging the respects in which improvements and reverses have occurred, as long as the

ateness of some of the norms used in prepar-
ing Tables 3 and 4. Specifically, alternative
norms were seriously considered as follows:
(a) For young nonwhites, count a decrease in per cent single as favorable, and for consistency count an increase in per cent with marriage intact as favorable. These new norms for young nonwhites would then be

opposite those used for young whites. The rationale behind this proposal is the fact that in 1960 the per cent with marriage intact was much lower for young nonwhites than for young whites and the assumption that an increase in this percentage would largely reflect improved circumstances among young nonwhites which offered them a greater measure of free choice about age at marriage. This rationale was not considered sufficiently plausible, however, to justify the use of opposing norms for young whites and young nonwhites.
(6) For all groups (by age, color, and sex) count an increase in divorce as favorable. The rationale behind this proposal rests on the observation that some segments of the population have decreased their per cent separated at the same time that they have increased their per cent divorced; the inference suggested by this simultaneous shift was that improved financial ability and social freedom were permitting more people to end marriages that were no longer viable by obtaining a divorce rather than lingering in a state of separation. Important factors in rejecting this alternative were the speculative nature of the inference just cited and the irregularity with which increases in divorce have been counterbalanced by decreases in separation.
Despite the rejection of these two alterna-
tive sets of norms, the effects of accepting
them were tested by modifying the entries

in Table 4. The modified results are shown in Table 8 which reveals the impressive fact that when these alternatives are used the number of unfavorablecomponents of major change in marital status is reducedfrom six to only two. These two "unfavorable" components, as newly defined, are a decrease in divorce for young nonwhite men and an increase in per cent single for young nonwhite

women--neither of which seems particularly unfavorable, in the context of substantial declines in per cent separated for young nonwhite men and women. The alternative norms place older nonwhite persons at the top of the list in regard to net major favorable changes and leave young nonwhite persons with the only unfavorable changes.
2. Use other age detail. If the analysis in Table 4 had been carried out for the combined age group 18 to 64 on the basis of the data in Table 9, the general pattern of the results would have been very similar to the pattern for the group 25 to 64 years old in Table 4. This finding is a consequence in part of the use of the same norms of favorableness for persons 18 to 64 as for those 25 to 64. However, the use of a single complete age range (instead of placing the younger and older groups separately in a disaggregated analysis) obscures the internal "mix" and therefore provides less basis for pinpointing the groups which are changing their marital status in one direction or another.
If the basic data had been available in finer age detail, somewhat different age groupings of younger and older persons might have been selected. Thus, for women, relatively young marriage might have been defined as something like 16 to 20 years of age, and for men young marriage might have been defined as something like 18 to 22. Beginning with Current Population Survey tabulations made in 1968, age detail by single years from 16 to 25 will become available annually for single and ever-married persons by sex and race.
3. Attach weights to components. Another variation in summarizing the marital changes would be to attach weights to the components, such as the algebraical amount of the changes recorded in Tables 1 and 2, with the signs modified as necessary to agree with the norms given in Table 3. This procedure would clearly show young white

women as having made the largest volume of favorable change and young white men as having made relatively little change, according to the norms in Table 3.
4. Show rates of change.An alternative to the simple arithmetic changes in Tables 1 and 2 would be to replace them with rates of change over the five-year period. Among the considerations for rejecting this alternative was the smallness of several of the marital status categories; not only the amounts of change but also the bases of the rates of

change would be subject to considerable variation because of sampling error. At the same time, this alternative might dismiss as minor some substantial changes in the larger marital categories (amounting to 1% or more).
5. Change the number of marital status categories. The number of components of change could be reduced by combining per cent separated and per cent divorced into a single category for "per cent with marriage disrupted." Table 10 shows that the "net favorable" count would not be very different whether marriage disrupted is counted as one or two components. However, showing only the combined category would obscure the considerable differences in the in-

ternal "mix" of the component changes by age, color, and sex.
SUMMARY
This study of recent major changes in marital status justifies the conclusion that a clear majority of the changes were favorable, where "favorable" reflects an increase in the proportion single among young adults and an increase in proportion married among adults of more mature age. According to the criteria used, nonwhites recorded 10favorable major changes out of a possible 20,5 unfavorable major changes, and 5 which were not classified as major. Whites likewise recorded 10 favorable major changes, but only 1 unfavorable major change and 9 changes not classified as major. Thus, de-

spite the evidence of gains in marital stability among nonwhites, the evidence of such gains among whites was even stronger. By various ways of measuring and evaluating changes in marital status between 1960 and 1965, young white women scored relatively high, and young nonwhite men scored relatively low, on net favorable change.
Advantages and disadvantages of several alternative measures of change in marital status were presented, together with the effects that some of the alternatives would have had on the evaluation of changes if they had been adopted. In general, if the alternative procedures had been adopted, similar overall conclusions, but somewhat unlike detailed conclusions, would have been drawn about changes in marital status for subgroups by age, color, and sex.
