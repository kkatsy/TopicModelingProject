Mortality trends are important demographic parameters because they provide direct evidence for the analysis of transitions in population size, structure, and composition. Patterns of mortality may also serve as useful indicators of the action of various biological processes in a population. The infant death rate in a particular community, for example, might furnish clues as to the efficacy of different disease producing agencies, the effects of such environmental conditions as altitude or climate upon adaptation and survival, or some of the outcomes of changes in the nutritional status of the population. The level of prereproductive mortality in a population is closely related to the potential operation of natural selection (Crow, 1958, 1962).
Often, statistical data on human mortality are obtained from demographic surveys of large and heterogenous populations, such as states or entire nations. While many valuable insights have been gained through this approach, the construction of mortality profiles for specific communities can help to elucidate numerous additional facets of human death. The study of mortality in individual populations within the context of their unique demographic and environmental circumstances is advisable

for two purposes: (1) to enhance the understanding of the diverse biological and ecological factors influencing mortality; and (2) to increase awareness of the extensive variability across human populations with respect to patterns of survival and death.
As part of a wider investigation of the genetic, demographic, and evolutionary consequences of population transplantation (Halberstein, 1973, 1974; Halberstein and Crawford, 1974), the present research focuses upon mortality in a migrant population in Central Mexico. Through the analysis of historical vital statistics records, questionnaire data, and census materials from Cuanalan in the state of Mexico, an attempt is made to interpret the observed trends in age at death, infant and childhood mortality, survivorship, and cause of death over the past century in terms of a number of ecological and cultural variables affecting the community. The evolutionary implications of the findings are discussed, especially with regard to the potential action of natural selection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The state of Mexico, located in the Valley of Mexico, is subdivided into 120 administrative sections known as municipios

(townships). One municipio, Acolman, occupies 86.29 square kilometers in the eastern portion of the state. In addition to the executive center (cabecera), Acolman consists of 16 barrios (territorial subunits). The population studied here is Cuanalan, a barrio of 2,040 inhabitants. Figure 1 situates the state of Mexico in relation to bordering states, the Federal District (the metropolitan area of Mexico City), and the rest of the country. Figure 2 locates Acolman and Cuanalan within the state of Mexico.

(Halberstein et al., 1973). Spaniards and Tlaxcalans collaborated to form a military alliance against the Aztecs of Central Mexico, and the state of Tlaxcala became a major link in the geographic network traveled by Spanish soldiers connecting the east coast of Mexico and the Aztec capital of Tenotchtitlan (Bernai Diaz [1568] 1927, p. 269; White, 1971, p. 187; Ixlilxochitl, 1969, p. 138).
Informants in Cuanalan reported that the original migrants were Tlaxcalan political prisoners transported by Spaniards

The earliest residents of Cuanalan were migrants from the adjoining state of Tlaxcala who were relocated for political and military reasons by Spanish authorities during the early colonial period in the New World. Spanish contact with Tlaxcala first occurred in 1519 and lasted until the formal termination of colonial rule in 1823

Work on the dike proceeded intermittently and was not completed until 1751 according to its commemorative plaque.

date of the migration is uncertain, but two possible times are suggested in the literature on the colonization of Tlaxcala. Some 16,000 Tlaxcalan warriors were mobilized and sent into the Valley of Mexico in 1519 and 1520 (Prescott [1843] 1901, Vol. II, pp. 66 and 393; White, 1971, p. 241). According to Gibson (1967, p. 185), Spanish administrators supervised the transplantation of 401 Tlaxcalan families to four new colonies to the north and to

two additional locations west of Tlaxcala in 1591.
Cuanalan lies in an ecological zone characterized by the finest farmland in the Valley of Mexico (Sanders, 1965, p. 26), and agriculture forms the subsistence base of the community. Nearly three-fourths of the working adults are actively engaged in farming pursuits. However, Cuanalan does not maintain a marketplace, and residents must journey elsewhere to sell

the commodities not consumed or exchanged privately in the barrio itself. Corn, beans, poultry, and meat products are the major salable items. Neither a public health clinic nor medical service of any kind is found in Cuanalan; the nearest facility is located six kilometers away in the cabecera of Acolman. Since, 19S6, a regular bus service has provided passage from Cuanalan to various highway stations where connections are available for Mexico City arid other large commercial centers. An analysis of the 1970 government census of Cuanalan revealed that household composition is quite variable. Ninety-five of 280 sampled dwellings, or slightly over one-third, contain extended families. The mean size of residential units is 6.76 persons. However, 35 households are occupied by single persons or couples, and 10 households have 15 or more individuals. Several homes visited during the fieldwork accommodate two to four related nuclear families in separate dwellings, each with an entrance facing a common courtyard.
A comprehensive biological investigation of Cuanalan was conducted in 1972. A team of seven researchers collected the following data: serological specimens, dermatoglyphics, dental impressions, color vision tests, anthropométrie measurements, demographic information, and complete medical examinations.
The demographic information was secured from three sources: (1) the 1970 government census of the barrio; (2) vital statistics registers located in the municipal executive office, and (3) a demographic proforma.
The census provided data on population size, household size and composition, population structure, and occupations of Cuanalan residents. The municipal records contain certificates of births, deaths, and marriages from 1866 through 1970. Microfilmed copies of entries pertinent to Cu-

analan were made for each year from 1866 through 1879. For 1880-1970, photographs were taken of the materials from even-numbered years. The death records are thorough and complete. Each warrant lists the name, age (in years and months), sex, and birthplace of the deceased party; the location and cause of death; and the exact date and time of death. After 1930, the death notices were signed by a licensed physician who presumably was familiar with each case. Prior to that date, the accounts were rendered by relatives of the deceased. On many of the forms after 1930 a space is provided for the race ("raza") of the individual, and "Mestizo" is the response in every instance. The information was coded and transferred to computer cards; 1,529 separate death records were transcribed. A BMD07D. (Biomédical) program (Dixon, 1971, p. 95) cross-tabulated the data according to type of variable and date of each record. The same program produced stratified histograms of the variables by selected time units.
The 278 demographic interviews administered in the community resulted in information regarding 2,570 consanguineal relatives from Cuanalan, including deceased persons, immigrants, and emigrants for whom data was received. The questionnaire afforded an examination of mortality parameters similar to those explored through the written documents.
RESULTS
Based upon data collected from the municipal registry, Table 1 shows the ages at death for 1,529 males and females in twenty-year segments from 1866 to 1970. Mean ages at death were computed for each time period; adjusted means apply to only those individuals who had survived the first year of life.
The increases in both measures have

been linear, and the standard deviation has likewise undergone an elevation through time. F values (10.54 for means and 18.22 for adjusted means) indicate that the overall temporal changes are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. In the total sample there is a difference of almost nine years between mean and adjusted mean age at death. The distinction between the two indicators has become progressively wider through time, and the separation is about 16.5 years in the latest period (1951-70).
Age at death in the total Cuanalan sample exhibits a strong similarity to the Mexican Indian population of San Pablo, Tlaxcala, studied by Halberstein and Crawford (1972), where the overall mean age at death is 20.22 years and the adjusted mean is 30.06 years.

Male and female ages at death for the same samples are compared in Table 2. Female ages at death are characterized by steady increases in both mean and adjusted mean age. The upward shifts in these measures is less regular for males, but an analysis of variance identified the trends as statistically significant for both sexes at the 0.01 level. Male and female ages at death and standard deviations are quite similar in the total sample. Standard errors of the mean were scored, and the sexual differences are not statistically significant throughout the various time units, probably because of the large standard deviations. However, in the latest time period (1951--70), females show a more pronounced rise in average age at death.
Assuming that the records are correct, the absolute number of deaths in Cuanalan has diminished in recent years. There were an average of 34.0 deaths per year during 1891-1930, and 24.6 deaths per year during 1931-70.
Ages at death for the total sample are shown in Table 3. Over 30 per cent of all deaths between 1866 and 1970 were of infants (under one year of age). More than half of the deaths were children younger than five years of age. Proportionally fewer females succumbed as infants, but they exhibit a higher percentage of deaths from

in Cuanalan over the past century isnot typical of the present survivorship rates in the nation in two respects--childhood mortality was more severe in Cuanalan, and survival to older ages (i.e., 60 and above) occurred less frequently in Cuanalan over thepast century than now occurs in the country as a whole. A comparison of the modern period (1951-70) in Cuanalan with Mexico as a whole in 1966 maintains these differentials, although their magnitude is reduced (see Table 5).
A somewhat different picture is seen in the death table constructed for 1866-90 (Table 5). Children under age five ac-

ages one through four, producing anapproximate sexual equality in the susceptibility to early death. Probability of dying diminishes at age five, and deaths are fairly uniformly distributed throughout theremainder of theage categories until age 70, after which a second attenuation occurs.

the first year of life has shown less systematic fluctuations through time than total prereproductive mortaility (Table 6). Possible reasons for the unusually high percentage in 1951-70 have already been discussed. In each time segment analyzed, infants comprise the largest cohort in age at death. The overall magnitude of infant mortality is similar to that in a Tlaxcalan Indian community (Halberstein and Crawford, 1972) and in Mexico for 1966: Cuanalan, 30.09 per cent; San Pablo, Tlaxcala, 33.33 per cent; Mexico (1966), 28.97 per cent.
A finer analysis of the sample of 460 infant deaths in Cuanalan since 1866 is provided by Table 7. Mean age at death

of infants has historically been well under six months. The consistently high mortality within the first month of life is further evidence that the time of infant

death has not been randomly distributed throughout the first year.
Data on prenatal mortality was elicited by the demographic questionnaire. Of the 275 fertile married women studied, 61 (22.18 per cent) were purported to have suffered from some type of reproductive wastage--at least one miscarriage, spontaneous abortion, or stillbirth. 23 of the 61 (37.7 per cent) had experienced multiple episodes.
Ages at death recalled during the demographic interview by informants for their deceased relatives from Cuanalan are presented in Table 8. The sample of 604 individuals includes all deaths in Cuanalan irrespective of place of origin. Several differences may be seen in comparison to the written sources. Mean and adjusted mean ages at death are higher for both sexes, and males appear to have outlived females. The frequency of infant death is much below that disclosed by the civil documents. Failures of memory or errors in the estimates of well-meaning informants are probably the causes of the discrepancies. These results should raise questions concerning the reliance upon informant reports for age-at-death information.
Table 9 specifies the time of death by month of the year, according to the accounts in the registry. Deaths are generally distributed throughout the year. Chisquare values of 24.54 and 21.61 at seven degrees of freedom indicate that signifi-

is probably related to the greater longevity of females. Accidents and violence, the sixth leading cause of fatality among males, was found to be negligible in the death of females. The two sexes do not appear to differ significantly in the causes of mortality according to a chi-square value of 21.69 with 21 degrees of freedom.
Table 11 charts the historical changes in leading causes of death. Since 1866, respiratory infections and gastrointestinal disorders have increased, while ill-defined causes and childhood infections have decreased. The high percentages of influenza deaths during 1911-30 may be traced to a single devastating epidemic in Cuanalan in the last two months of 1918. In November alone, 29 lives were lost. Cirrhosis of the liver does not emerge as a leading cause of death until after 1930. Cardiovascular dysfunction was a rare cause of death until the most recent time period (1951-70), when it represented the third ranking cause of death with a frequency of 9.58 per cent. Cancer, the cause of only one of the sampled deaths before 1950, became the eighth leading cause in 1951-- 70 and was responsible for 3.2 per cent of

the deaths. Among infants only, as in the sample at large, both ill-defined causes and childhood infections have decreased in frequency, while the proportions of deaths induced by respiratory conditions and gastrointestinal diseases have increased. Prematurity has also been a consistently highranking cause of death among Cuanalan infants (Halberstein, 1973).
Table 12 identifies the leading causes of death in Cuanalan as reported by informants for a sample of 418 deceased relatives. The high rates of fatality from respiratory conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, and childhood infections compare favorably with the municipal records. Deaths by cancer and diabetes are found more frequently in informant responses than in the written death notices. Neither ill-defined and unknown causes nor senility were counted in order to avoid possibly faulty interpretations.
The major causes of death in Mexico for 1960, as described by Gabaldon (1965), are listed in Table 13. There are some contrasts with the findings from Cuanalan, although the differences may result from the manner in which the

author has arranged some of the national data. For example, pneumonia and bronchitis are separated into two categories which, when taken together, would constitute the leading cause of death. Accidents are distinguished from homicides, but, childhood infections and prematurityare lumped into a single category. Ill-defined and unknown causes were responsible for 11.11 per cent of all the deaths in 1960. The latest available data on cause of death in Mexico (for 1964) are summarized by .Preston et al., (1972, p. 456459). Their statistics also suggest that infectious diseases, including pneumonia, bronchitis, and influenza, comprise the leading causes of death throughout the

country, followed by diseases of early childhood, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, and parasitosis. Thus, it may be said that the causes of death in Cuanalan generally correspond to national patterns.
The three most common agents of death in Cuanalan are the same as those discovered in the Tlaxcalan Indian population studied by Halberstein and Crawford (1972) as is shown in Table 14.
DISCUSSION
Early death has been a dominant and pervasive phenomenon in Cuanalan, Mexico, over the past century, and it continues to be commonplace in the community.
The present study supports Cockbum's (1959, 1971) contention that an agricultural economy creates ecological conditions which foster the contraction and contagion

of infectious diseases. Infectious diseases have historically taken a great toll on the Cuanalan population. In recent years, degenerative disorders have claimed an increasing proportion of lives, but respiratory conditions, gastrointestinal diseases, and childhood infections persist as the major fatal agencies.
The prominence of respiratory ailments as the leading cause pi death poses a theoretical problem. Bogue (1969, p. 578) points out that, in reality, death is often brought about by a combination of several pathological processes. Difficulty in breathing and/or respiratory infections often accompany other serious conditions. It is also possible that in the earlier time periods respiratory disease was recorded simply because the victim experienced erratic breathing or trachea! contractions at the moment of expiration.
One factor contributing to the high rate of gastrointestinal disorders in the population is the presence and consumption of contaminated water. Although Cuanalan possesses a system of sewers and drains for waste disposal, the drinking water is polluted, and the means of purification are inadequate.
The general state of health of Cuanalan residents was observed to be substandard. Three hundred and nine young people under age 20 were examined by Gamboa (1972, unpublished), who found that 124, over 40 per cent, were suffering from malnutrition. Since students were recruited by school officials for participation in the study, there is no reason to assume that the sample is biased toward unhealthy individuals seeking the medical services offered as part of the investigation. Dr. Gamboa also diagnosed a wide variety of pathologies in the total sample of all ages, which represented over 25 per cent of the community. The diseases most often encountered were clinical anemia, gastrointes-

tinal disorders, and respiratory infections. Very few of the subjects had ever previously visited a physician or dentist.
Newman (1962) points out that malnutrition often increases a population's vulnerability to infectious diseases. In a Guatemalan population investigated by Scrimshaw et al. (1959), inadequate food intake was closely correlated with increased frequency and severity of infections such as pneumonia, measles, diarrhea, and tuberculosis. A similar relationship between malnutrition and susceptibility to infectious diseases is suggested by the Cuanalan data.
A reduction in overall and prereproductive mortality has characterized Cuanalan since 1866. Kammeyer (1971, p. 51) and Trewartha (1969, p. 119) point out that a young population is partly the product of a declining childhood and infant mortality rate. Amaga (1970, p. 220) states that the youthful Latin American populations of recent years is one of the consequences of mortality reductions in the younger age groups. The age structure of Cuanalan, constructed from the 1970 census and depicted in Figure 3, and the historical changes in mortality suggest that these trends are apparently affecting the community.
A sizeable proportion of young people is represented in Cuanalan's population pyramid. The 0-4 age group is the largest single cohort, followed by the 5-9 category. The age structure of Cuanalan strongly resembles that of the entire country of Mexico. The population pyramid for Mexico of 1966 has a broad base. The 0-5 age cohort is numerically the largest, comprising about 18 per cent of the total population (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971, p. 25). Of the total 1970 Cuanalan population, 44.9 per cent are individuals under age 15. Ehrlich and Ehrlich (1970, p. 332) cite 46 per cent as the 1970 Mexico national estimate. The median age of the

Cuanalan population is approximately 17 years: males (1,009), 16.93; females (1,029), 17.16; total (2,038), 17.4. Cuanalan's young population is also partly a consequence of the high level of achieved reproduction in the community (Halberstein, 1973).
The data from the present population are not exactly consonant with Bogue's (1969, p. 550) global model of survivorship in "developing" nations. Bogue writes that mortality is typically greatest in the first year of life, as in Cuanalan, but that it falls quickly in the second and third years, until by age nine it is very low and remains so until the mid-thirties, wherein it gradually accelerates. For the most part, mortality has been severe through at least age five in Cuanalan since 1866, and a later acceleration is not clearly visible.
The recently increasing death rate from heart disease and other degenerative dis-

orders in many regions of the world has aroused speculation regarding possible contributing demographic factors. Nye 0967) and Campbell (1963) associate the increase in fatal heart diseases with reductions in the incidence of lethal infectious diseases, especially in childhood, which result in an older population that is more susceptible to cardiovascular degeneration. The present findings are not in complete accord with this theory. Coronary disease and other degenerative disorders have not been prominent causes of death until the last twenty years, and life expectancy has risen at the same time. However, infectious diseases remain the leading causes of death, and the present population is marked by its substantial youthful constituent.
Certain of the demographic features of the present population are favorable for rapid evolutionary changes through natural

selection. The proportion of deaths of individuals under reproductive age has been high in Cuanalan since 1866 (S9.S3 per cent), and although the percentage has shown a gradual decline to the present, childhood mortality continues to claim a large segment of the population. Thus, even in a single generation, the population experiences considerable losses of genetic material in those individuals who die prior to reproductive maturity. Reproductive wastage in the form of prenatal mortality occurs frequently in Cuanalan, and this also leads to genetic discontinuity.
Cuanalan's high levels of fertility and prereproductive mortality and its broadbased tapering age pyramid suggest a rapidly changing population composition, a demographic situation which is conducive to the swift "turnover" of genotypes through the action of selection. In a comparison of nineteen modern Latin American populations with respect to Crow's (1958) index for the opportunity of natural selection, Halberstein (1973) observed that Cuanalan ranked second highest in both total index and the mortality component of the index. This result indicates that the operation of natural selection is very likely in Cuanalan and that it is promoted by the excessive childhood mortality in the population.
Generally, agricultural populations are marked by the highest indices for the opportunity of selection (Salzano, 1972). A number of workers subscribe to the theory that infectious diseases have formed the primary selective "pressure" in recent human evolution (Haidane, 19S7; Motulsky, 1960; Blumberg, 1970; CavalliSforza and Bodmer, 1971, p. 321). In Cuanalan, infectious diseases have historically comprised the three leading causes of death. If certain genotypes in this population confer greater resistance than others to the diseases, it is probable

that natural selection would proceed at a rapid rate and with important evolutionary effects. Thus, one possible element involved in the historical reduction in overall and childhood mortality in Cuanalan may be the evolution of more resistant genotypes via the process of natural selection through differential mortality. It is also possible that the mortality reductions are a result of improved medical assistance, although this is not reflected by the current health or nutritional status of the population. Since 1866 there has actually been a relatively small and gradual attenuation of the extremely high childhood death rate. Judging from the mortality patterns, the opportunity for natural selection in Cuanalan has not been appreciably arrested over the past hundred years.
CONCLUSION
Through the examination of historical and recent vital statistics records, census materials, and questionnaire data, an attempt is made in the present investigation to reconstruct the patterns of mortality over the past century in a small agricultural population in central Mexico.
The pronounced childhood mortality in Cuanalan since 1866 and the present age structure of the population are demographic attributes that are optimal for the rapid and extensive action of natural selection. Infectious diseases have historically comprised the leading causes of death in the population, suggesting that the community has been experiencing one of the more predominant trends of recent human evolution--natural selection through infectious diseases. The poor health of Cuanalan residents and the extremely high mortality in the population, especially in the younger age groups, are probably related to agricultural practices and to the consumption of contaminated water. The gradual reduction in overall and prereproductive mortality

270

in Cuanalan during the last hundred years may be interpreted as a possible result of selection favoring the differential survival and reproduction of disease-resistant genotypes.
