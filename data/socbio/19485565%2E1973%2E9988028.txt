Erratum and Further Analysis: ''Perinatal Conditions and Infant Development in Children with Schizophrenic Parents"
Sarnoff A. Mednick, Elaine Mura, Fini Schulsinger, and Birgitte Mednick
Psykologisk Institut Kommunehospitalet Copenhagen, Denmark

In a recent issue of Social Biology, Mednick, Mura, Schulsinger, and Mednick (1971, Vol. 18, Suppl., p. S1O3-S113) presented a preliminary study of the "Perinatal Conditions and Infant Development in Children with Schizophrenic Parents." In this study, we indicated that a significantly greater number of "Other" complications was suffered by the Schizophrenic Parent Group than the Character Disorder or Normal Parent Groups. The significance was tested with %2; the noted x2 was 9.48 (4 df, /><0.05). Since publication, two problems have developed regarding this preliminary study.
The first is that the x2 for "Other" complications was found to be in error. Instead of the reported result, the x2 was found to be 7.87 (4 df, p < 0.10). As stated in the article, the bulk of the difference between the groups in the "Other" complications category was contributed by the variable, birth weight. The other variables included in the "Other" complications scale reduced rather than enhanced the difference between the groups. Therefore, the authors decided to investigate the birth weight variable alone.

The second problem concerns the matching criteria employed in the study as reported in Table 1 of the original publication. The Parent Groups were drawn from Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. At the time of this study, admission to Rigshospitalet was restricted to unwed mothers and cases with anticipated severe pregnancy and/or delivery difficulties. Thus, if a given Parent Group had a surplus of unwed mothers (admitted for social reasons and typically young and healthy), we would expect (and empirically found) fewer PBCs in that group. In view of this, the entire analysis is currently being repeated with the Parent Groups matched for marital status in addition to the other seven matching variables. Matching for marital status yielded 32 married and 52 unmarried in each Parent Group. The other matching variables in Table 1 remained essentially unchanged. For purposes of this note, we analyzed the differences in birthweights between the children of the Schizophrenic Parent Group (mean = 3,053.5 grams) and the children of the Control Parent Group (mean = 3,263.2 grams). The difference was significant (i = 2.35, 168 df, p<0.0l).

Symposium on the Human Genetic Load

A symposium entitled "What Is Happening to Gene Frequencies in Man?" will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, on October 24, 1973. It will be sponsored jointly by the American Society of Human Genetics and by the Society for the Study of Social Biology. The symposium will be held on the opening evening of the annual meeting of the first society and in connection with the annual business meeting of the second society.

Barring late changes, the symposium program will include: "Medical Implications of the Genetic Load," W. J. Schull "Exposure of Modern Populations to Mutagenic Agents," H. E. Sutton; "Anticipated Effects of Carrier Detection, Intrauterine Diagnosis, and Reproductive Compensation," G. R. Fraser.
