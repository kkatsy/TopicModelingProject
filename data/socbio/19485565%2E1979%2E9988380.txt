ABSTRACT: From data collected in national fertility surveys in rural and semiurban areas ofMexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Peru, this paper analyzes for all noncontracepting women in sexual unions the probability of conceiving and conception delay by duration from the date of entry into unions. The similarity of the proportions conceiving and of estimates of fecundability among the four countries suggests the importance of biological factors. Though overall mean fecundabilities are somewhat low compared to other populations, this difference is largely due to the lower mean age at entry into unions rather than to lower age-specific fecundabilities.

One of the important but difficult areas of investigation in fertility is that of fecundability, or the probability of conception. Fecundability, along with many other variables, determines the observed reproductive behavior. In developed societies with a high use of contraception, fecundability may be of less relevance to the study of fertility. However in noncontraceptive societies, fecundability could be one of the prime determinants of fertility.
Defining fecundability as the "probability of conceiving during a month in the absence of conscious efforts to limit procreation" leads to the interesting question of why the sizes of families often vary widely in noncontraceptive societies. Hutterites have a mean completed family size of eleven children, while six children, or even fewer, is the mean in some communities in India and Africa. Nuptiality patterns by themselves cannot explain such large differences. Differential lactation

amenorrhea is important in explaining some of the variation in natural fertility. But some variation could also be due to differences in fecundability.
Fecundability variations among societies are largely due to behavioral factors rather than biological ones. The probability of conceiving in a given month depends on frequency of sexual intercourse, distribution of intercourse within the menstrual cycle, and the length of periods of separation of husband and wife (Leridon, 1977). Empirical studies of fecundability based on birth histories are few. Estimates in these studies vary from 0.144 and 0.180 in the United States (Potter and Parker, 1964; Westoff et al., 1961) and from 0.163 in Taiwan (Jain, 1969) to 0.318 in eighteenth-century European populations (Henry, 1964). Differences in the characteristics of the sample population make the validity of comparisons tenuous.

The objective of this paper is to provide estimates of probability of first conception and fecundability in certain Latin American populations in the absence of contraceptive use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data for this study come from fertility surveys done in the rural and semiurban areas (less than 20,000 population) in Costa Rica, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. The surveys were conducted in 1969 and 1970 under the direction of CELADE (Centro Latinamericano de Demografia) and known as PECFAL rural fertility surveys. Altogether, about 10,000 women of all marital statuses in the age group 15-49 were interviewed. However, the analysis of this paper is restricted to women who entered sexual unions and never used contraception in order to measure probabilities of conception among women exposed to the risk of pregnancy.
Complete contraceptive histories were

not collected in the survey so that nonuse periods among women whd were presently using or had ever used contraception cannot be identified. Ideally, we should eliminate only those who were using contraception in the interview in which we are interested. As this was not possible, we decided to exclude all those who had used contraception at any time. The exclusion of these women is not likely to be serious as the proportion of such women was low. The percentage of women who had ever used contraception was only 32 per cent in Costa Rica, 18 per cent in Colombia, 9 per cent in Mexico, and 9 per cent in Peru. It is quite possible that most of these women had not used contraception in the first interval, but a conservative approach was taken by excluding them altogether.
First intervals were calculated in months. Information on date of entry into sexual union, date of end of a pregnancy, and date of interview were coded in calendar month and year. The length of gestation was coded in months. Closed first in-

ing pregnant in the first three months of entering a sexual union or marriage is 0.327, and hence the probability of pregnancy delay is 0.673. Probabilities decline over time due to selectivity of the 1,464 women. Only 52 were not pregnant at the end of five years, with another 47 women lost to observation.
Conception delays at 12 months for the four countries are 0.294 for Mexico, 0.323 for Costa Rica, 0.325 for Peru, and 0.270 for Colombia. Thus, more than two-thirds will become pregnant in the first year. By the end of the third year, the probabilities of not becoming pregnant are only 0.073 in Mexico, 0.075 in Colombia, 0.090 in Peru, and 0.095 in Costa Rica; and by the end of the fifth year, 0.040, 0.044, 0.049, and 0.055 respectively.

The similarity among the four countries at the end of five years is remarkable and shows that in the absence of contraceptive use, various biological and behavioral factors are not of much relevance if a sufficiently long duration iscbnsidered. Of course, distribution within the five-year period had considerable importance for intervals and final completed family size. Though small numbers beyond five years make the rates less stable, by the end of eight years the cumulative probability of pregnancy delay levels off at 0.03 indicating a primary sterility of about 3 per cent in the sample populations.
