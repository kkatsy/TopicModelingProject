view and thus included in the sample. A resulting "trend" might be observed even if there were no intercohort change in interfaith marriage.
A similar bias exists if there is a tendency for those who marry a spouse of a different faith to eventually adopt the faith of that spouse. Such a tendency has particularly been reported for husbands (Warren, 1970). If homogamy increases over the course of marriage, then a higher proportion of all heterogamous marriages occurring to the cohort will be represented for the more recent than for the earlier cohorts. This factor, as well as marital instability, could result in an artifactual trend in cross-sectional data on interfaith marriage.
The present analysis is restricted to white women because there are few Negroes of the Catholic or Jewish religion. Intermarriage is defined as marriage out of one of the three major religious groups in the United States.2 More refined analysis would include a consideration of Protestant denominations, but

our sample size will not support that level of detail here.
With these qualifications in mind, we can turn to the NFS data in Table 2. When marriage cohorts are compared with respect to the proportion of individuals in the three major religious groups whose spouse is of a different faith, there is virtually a linear increase over time in the proportion in interfaith marriages, from 7% in the 1935-39 marriage cohort to 14% in the marriage cohort 1960-65. In this most recent cohort, 11% of the Protestants and 20% of the Catholics are in interfaith marriages. The series for Jews is less regular, although there is some indication of a trend. (The number of Jewish sample cases is very small and the proportions for the total sample result primarily from Protestant-Catholic marriages.)
To what extent is this observed trend artifactual? Unfortunately, there is no ready

answer to this problem. Some estimate of the artifactual component may be made by comparing the same marriage cohorts as sampled in 1955 and again ten years later.3 I t is precarious to test for differences as small as those observed here between two samples drawn under slightly different procedures. However, for the marriage cohorts 1940-54, the proportion of married individuals in interfaith marriages is 0.10 as measured in 1955 as compared to 0.08 asmeasured in 1965, a difference that would be expected randomly only 3% of the time under the assumption that these are independent random samples of the same population. If we accept 0.02 as an estimate of the effect of selective attrition in interfaith marriages over a ten-year period, we might conclude that about half of the observed trend is artifactual, since an increase of 0.04was measured between the marriage cohorts of 1950-54 and 1960-65 in the retrospective data. Even so, there would be some evidence of an upward trend in interfaith marriage. However, we noted earlier that in the Canadian vital statistics (where the problems of
3 The 1955 data are unpublished tabulations based on the 1955 Growth of American Families Study reported, in part, in Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell,1959.

attrition are absent) there is a unilinear upward trend in interfaith marriage. Figure 1 plots both the NFS and the Canadian data, and the similarity between the two is striking. With the exception of the recent acceleration, the Canadian trend is less steep than the slope based on the NFS data and may well indicate what would bemeasured for the United States in the absence of the biases discussed earlier. Taking these sample biases into account, the NFS data lend support to the thesis that the trend of interfaith marriage in the United States has been similar to the trend observed in Canada.
For those concerned with the intergenerational transmission of religious identity, parental religion may be a more relevant variable for comparison than current religion. However, the measurement of trends in interfaith marriage as denned by this variable is even more problematic than when intermarriage is defined by current religion. Briefly, for conceptual clarity it is necessary to exclude individuals whose parents were of different faiths; but the effect of this procedure may be to exclude those least inclined to religious endogamy. This would be a cumulative bias if interfaith marriages had increased over the parental generation as

well. At any rate, when intercohort comparisons are made with respect to the proportion of individuals married to a spouse whose parents' religion differs from their own parents' religion, there is evidence of an uneven increase over the time period represented (Table 3). In the most recent cohort, 17% of all married individuals whose parents were of the same faith married spouses whose parents were of a different faith. The proportions are 12% among Protestants and 30% among Catholics.

loosening of these norms as part of an overall secularization of society (Heer, 1962, p. 252). Perhaps so; but there are additional factors that should be considered. It is frequently noted that the probability of interfaith marriage is limited by the relative sizes of the religious groups involved (Heer, 1962; Besanceney, 1965). While the numerical availability of potential mates of differing religions is one factor affecting intermarriage rates, there are a number of other variables that should be considered as well. Figure 2 presents schematically some of these additional relationships that may be relevant to changes in interfaith marriage rates.
Although Figure 2 could be elaborated upon at some length, such is not the purpose of this paper. The general point to be made is that endogamous norms are only part of a complex web of factors affecting intermarriage. It has been frequently demonstrated that among the more important factors in assortative mating are propinquity and social and economic similarity (Warren, 1966; Catton and Smircich, 1964). Historically, religious groups in the United States have been quite dissimilar both with respect to ethnic origin and socioeconomic status, and such dissimilarity would operate against interfaith marriages through a number of routes, only one of which would be the effect on endogamous norms. Spatial segregation with respect to ethnic and social status is well documented as is the social segregation of peer group relations among those living in the same area (Duncan and Duncan, 1960; Louman and Guttman, 1966).
Consequently, ethnic and socioeconomic dissimilarity of religious groups would affect intermarriage rates indirectly through patterns of spatial and social segregation as well as directly through endogamous norms with respect to status and ethnicity. If religious groups have become more similar over time,

FIG. 2.--Schematic representation of factors affecting interfaith-marriage rates

we might expect a consequent increase in interfaith marriage whether or not there has been a loosening of endogamous norms.
Indeed, there has been a marked increase in ethnic and socioeconomic similarity between Protestants and Catholics over the period under consideration (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1965, Table 9). As evidenced in Table 4, the parents of Catholics married between 1935 and 1939 were substantially less educated than those of Protestants who married during those years; on the other hand, for the 1960-65 marriage cohort, the educational backgrounds of Protestants and Catholics are virtually identical.
Similar convergence has occurred with respect to ethnic background. Catholics who are foreign born or whose parents are foreign born come overwhelmingly from different ethnic groups than Protestants of foreign birth or parentage. For the whole United States, the proportion of individuals in the prime marriage ages (15-25) of foreign birth

or parentage has declined steadily from 36% in 1930 to 16% in 1960.
Separate estimates for Protestants and Catholics indicate parallel declines. Since the effect of ethnic origin on both place of residence and style of life decreases markedly with time since immigration, we would expect that ethnic differences between Protestants and Catholics of marriage age have declined markedly over this period. Although a higher proportion of the earliest cohorts are Protestant, changes in the relative sizes of religious groups could not have accounted for the trend in interfaith marriages after the marriage cohorts of 1945-49. Numerical dissimilarity has slightly increased since this cohort, since 65% of the 1960-65 cohort is Protestant compared with 63% of the 1945-49 marriage cohort.4
4 The usual statistical procedure for removing the effects of numerical dissimilarity is inappropriate for trend analyses. The ratio of observed rates to rates expected randomly on the basis of the marginals implies a unique set of marginals. See Blau and Duncan, 1967, p. 90-97.

SUMMARY
In summary, there hasbeen a trend toward interfaith marriage over the last 25 years in the United States. Although the complexity of the web of factors affecting interfaith-marriage rates makes causal inference hazardous, it islikely that increasing religious similarity with respect to ethnic and socioeconomic background has played a major role in this trend.
