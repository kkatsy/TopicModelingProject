ABSTRACT: The relationship between education and accuracy of age reporting is investigated by using data collected from Yoruba females in Western Nigeria. Although in the long run the future improvement in age reporting in Nigeria and the rest of the developing world will depend on improved literacy, the findings suggest that at present education of respondent may not significantly contribute to accurate age reporting. It is suggested that, for the near future, improvement of vital registration would be the major factor leading to accurate reporting. Improved vital registration would increase people's knowledge of their age and lead to more accurate reporting.

In developing countries age distributions reported in censuses or surveys are usually affected by marked misstatement of age (United Nations, 1967, p. 15), yet data on age are essential in the computation of basic demographic measures needed for the study of population change. As more effort is being devoted to collecting adequate demographic data in these countries, interest is directed to aspects of socioeconomic development that would lead to collection of more reliable information. The influence of education on age-data collection is one of the areas of primary interest in this effort.
Generally, age misreporting in developing countries has been attributed to illiteracy or lack of formal education (Van de Walle, 1966). Therefore it is widely believed that with increasing formal education (especially that of the respondent) accuracy of age reporting will improve. This paper examines the effect of education of respondent on accuracy of age reporting among Yoruba females in Western Nigeria.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data for this paper were largely drawn from the first of three surveys constituting the Nigerian segment of the Changing African Family Project--a cross-cultural study of changes within the family which are, or may ultimately be, related to changes in fertility levels and patterns (Okediji et al., 1976; Sembajwe, 1977). This survey covered Yoruba females aged 15-59 living in Ibadan City in 1973.
A total of 6,606 eligible respondents were selected on a random sample basis with a selection fraction of 1out of 24. Ibadan was divided into 359 grids and a random sample of 1 block out of 24 blocks within each grid square was selected. A complete listing of population in the selected blocks was made, and all eligible respondents were interviewed.
Interviewers were nearly all Yoruba females with at least four years of secondary education. Some male interviewers were used, comprising about 7 per cent of all interviewers. One supervisor was employed for every two interviewers, and both the

supervisor and the interviewer went back to discuss further with the interviewees any inconsistent results. Much effort and money were devoted to selecting and training interviewers, and these factors together with close supervision were expected to lead to good quality data. Therefore, except where the interviewer made the estimate of age, his/her effect on the results was very minimal and caused no systematic bias. The language of interview was Yoruba, and the original questionnaire was in Yoruba.
During the survey, the question on age was asked in two forms:
(1) Age, and (2) Year of birth as follows: Please tell me how old you are (use indirect approach if advisable). That means the year of your birth was (write in) 19 (check inconsistencies and try to find age).
The sections in parentheses were instructions to the interviewers. The second part of the question was intended as a check, and the interviewers were strictly instructed not to subtract the reported age from 1973 (the year of the survey) to obtain the date of birth without first asking the woman her date of birth and then asking further questions if there were any inconsistencies. As a scale of accuracy the interviewer had to assign the respondent to one of the following:
(1) Accurate--if the woman gave an exact date of birth as well as the age without difficulty.'
(2) Probably accurate--ifthe respondent gave the age and an imprecise date of birth such as "I think during the rainy season of 1930."
(3) Estimatemade by woman.--For example, "I was born two years before the end of World War II," or "I must be about 30 because my brother who is about two or three years older than me is 33."
(4) Estimate made by interviewer. If the woman herself did not know her age

and could not give an event that happened around the time of her birth, the interviewer had to estimate the age. (The interviewer was particularly instructed that it would be better if he asked the woman politely how old she was when she was married, for those who were married, and the length of time she had been married and then make a calculation and say, "Well, if I can do my arithmetic right, you were born in 19 .")
Two major criticisms about this type of question are warranted. First, emphasis was put on recording the year of birth rather than the date of birth. The month and day of birth were given little emphasis, thus leaving a wide margin of error in age recording. Secondly, much reliance was put on the interviewers' calculations to estimate ages of respondents who could not report their dates of birth. The possibility of an arithmetic error on the part of the interviewer was not provided for. Probably if the interviewer had been instructed to record the date of marriage and/or the duration of marriage of the respondent, this type of error would have been avoided.
Nevertheless, information on age collected in this survey provides a good opportunity to test the hypothesis that education increases the accuracy of age reporting, and as noted above the interviewers' effect on the results of women said to have reported their age accurately is minimal. Most (54 per cent) of the women in Ibadan had no formal education. But a fair number of women had some education: 27 per cent had a primary school education; 14 per cent had some secondary education; and 5 per cent had completed secondary school or gone beyond.
RESULTS
As expected, data from the survey and other surveys in Nigeria in Table 1 clearly

demonstrate that it is mainly educated individuals who reported their age "accurately" ("Accurate" or "accurately" are used in this paper to mean that the age reported was said to be accurate.) In Ibadan City only 20 per cent of women who had no schooling reported age "accurately" while 78 per cent of women with a secondary education and higher did so. Reporting was better among young age groups than among the older groups (Table 2, bottom). This finding is as expected since the spread of Western-type of education is a relatively recent phenomenon in Western Nigeria. The findings agree with those from other developing countries, for example, India (Ambannavar and Visaria, 1975).
The next logical step was to investigate

the age distributions of the respondents divided by type of age reporting "accuracy," i.e., those who were reported to have stated their age "accurately" as opposed to those who were reported to have had doubts about their age or whose age was estimated. Special attention was paid to those women reported to have stated their age "accurately" tosee whether their age distribution appears significantly less distorted than theoverall agedistribution and, in particular, less distorted than the age distribution of the respondents whose age reporting was said to have been inaccurate.
Figure 1 plots the "reported accurately" distribution with that for the overall survey population andfor the "inaccurately reported" distribution. The most striking revelation is that women who reported their age "accurately" exhibit more extreme heaping on age twenty

than those who reported their ageinaccurately. There is similar heaping on age 25 and, to a certain extent, less heaping on age 30 and the rest of the ages ending in "0" and " 5 " for those said to have reported their age "accurately" than for those who reported inaccurately.
To detect errors in age data, several methods are used. One of them is Myers (1940) blended method for calculating indexes of terminal digit preference which takes into account the effect of mortality. The results for Ibadan indicate that there was much concentration on ages ending in "0" and " 5 " (the indexes for these digits were 21.7and 11.3respectively). Onthe other hand, there was much avoidance for ages ending in " 1 " and"9" andto a lesser extent those ending in "4" and "7".The summary index is 27.0,indicating that a substantial proportion ofthe female population reported their ageincorrectly.

same pattern of preference is characteristic of many other African countries (Nagi etal., 1973, pp.168-169).
Looking at the "accurately" reported distributions (Figure 2), we can observe that for both groups of women (those with some education and those with no education) there is marked heaping on ages20, 25, and 30 and to a lesser extent on ages 35,40, and45. In addition, there appears to beaconcentration ofrespondents in the age range 20-34 for both groups of respondents, indicating that at present education does not lead tosignificantly better reporting of age in Ibadan, even though women who are said to have reported their age "accurately" aremainly those with education. This finding is not unique to Ibadan. In India itwas found that thequality ofage returns in successive Indian censuses since 1951 deteriorated in spite of rapid growth in literacy and education (Ambannavar andVisaria, 1975, p. 14).
Looking at the survey distribution in isolation, one would be led to conclude that the unusual bulge in the age range 20-34 canbeexplained byrural-urban migration since Ibadan is a city likely to attract a significant number of migrants as do other urban centers. It would seem that rural-urban migration caused the unusual

bulge in the survey age distribution--that while the rural areas lost young adultsage 20-34 the urban areas gained persons of these ages. Toa certain extent this maybe true. But to a greater extent the bulge in the age distribution must be due to other factors because the claim that migration into the city accounts for the bulge is discounted by available evidence (Figure 3). The bulge is equally characteristic of both the migrant and indigenous women age distributions. For indigenous women, 66 per cent arein agerange 20-34 asopposed to 65 percent for migrant women.
Both the 1963 census and the survey show almost an identical bulge in age range 20-34, while age group 15-19 and some of the older age groups suffer unusual deficits (see Ibadan Division ruraland urban groups in Figure 4). The bulge in age range 20-34 is not only characteristic of Ibadan City butalso of the whole ofNigeria and the Western Region (Figure 4) and other regions in Nigeria (Olusanya, 1975, pp. 254-274). Omiata found the same characteristic in a rural locality of Western Nigeria, and the same is true of Orubuloye's Ekiti and Ibadan rural age distributions (Omiata, 1975;Orubuloye, 1977). Similar distortions were observed in a number of other African countries

be approximated by a selected stable population model. Two parameters are required to select this stable population model from Brass's two-parameter model life tables (Carrier and Hobcraft, 1971). In this study, 12 (the proportion surviving to age two) estimated for Ibadan as 895 per thousand, and a gross reproduction rate of 2.7 (again estimated for Ibadan from the survey information) were used to select the model (Sembajwe, 1977, pp. 87-88).
The selected population distribution shown in Table 3 has 428 per thousand of the population under 15 years, while the proportion aged 45 and over is 143 per thousand. In the survey there were 6,606 women interviewed aged 15 to 59, and 6,128 of these represented age group 15-44. If we assume that the 6,128 women represent 429 per thousand of the female population as would be the case in the stable population model, then the female population under 15years (which is equivalent to 428 per thousand according to the stable population model) would be 6,114',
'Population under 15 = (6,128+0.429) x 0.428 = 6,114.

and the population aged 45 and over (which is equivalent to 143 per thousand according to the model) would be 2,043. This brings the total sample population in the survey, if females of all ages had been interviewed, to 14,286 (6,114 under 15; 6,128 in age group 15-44; and 2,043 over 44 years). The distribution of this population compared with the selected stable population distribution per thousand is shown in Table 3. The last column of the table shows the relative excess or deficit of the recorded population over that of the stable population in each age group. The evidence confirms that there is indeed an excess of females in age range 20-34 as observed earlier.
Table 4 presents an estimation of the possible transfers of women from one age group to another. The transfers from younger to older age groups and from older to younger age groups converge on age group 25-29 which in addition to having the expected population recorded has some gains from age groups 20-24 and 30-34. The longest transfer occurred from age group 15-19 to 20-24, suggesting that some women under age 20 reported themselves or were reported as 20 years and over. On the other hand, the table indicates that some women over the age of 34 reported themselves or were reported by the interviewer as younger. Therefore, the analysis confirms further that there were transfers of women from younger and older age groups to the age range 20-34.
DISCUSSION
One possible factor explains the extreme heaping on age 20 for women who allegedly reported their age "accurately." It is possible that those who were not married and/or without children but over 20 might have reported 20 as their age to appear young, while those who were married

early and/or had children but were under 20 may have reported age 20 or a higher age in order to appear older, especially in view of the fact that among theYorubasocial status is very much attached to age. Similar reasons can be put forward for ages 25 and 30,while the universal digital preference might have been an additional cause of heaping onthese ages andthe major cause for heaping on ages 35, 40, 45, 50, and 55. Oneother explanation forthe distortion may be that educated women are ashamed to admit that they do not know their birth dates (which may well be the case if their parents were illiterate) and therefore give an estimate which they claim is exact. Often the date of birthmay have already been acquired when these women signed a written statement before a lawyer as a part of the requirement for getting a job in the modern sector. This would suggest that in the short run the education of the respondent may not be a primary factor determining age accuracy.

It would appear that the education of parents (thefirst generation) would be the primary factor since it is the parents who normally register births of their children. Education of parents would not,however, be effective on its own unless it were accompanied byimproved vital registration. Vital registration, if adequately practiced, would not only improve age reporting among literate populations, but also among illiterate ones because the mere fact that there will be a record of birth as an event will increase people's knowledge of their birth dates and will facilitate the accurate reporting of age.
In the long run, education as a part of socioeconomic development would increase people's knowledge about thenecessity for reporting their age accurately and hence the need for keeping accurate birth-date records and related improved reporting. However, in the short run, successful registration systems could be the immediate solution to accurate age re-

cords if they are started in countries with administrative structures which extend their administrative institutions right to the village level. For example, it would be possible for a country like Tanzania, which has village governments as the smallest administrative units, to entrust one of the village officials with the task of monitoring and recording vital events (such as births, deaths, marriage and migration) in the village.
With regard to future research, it would be useful to identify respondents who have birth certificates and compare their recorded age distribution with the distribution of those who have no birth certificates. Such information would be useful for indicating the relationship between vital registration and accuracy of age reporting.
CONCLUSIONS
Education of respondent does not appear to improve the accuracy of age reporting significantly. Although it is mainly educated women, especially the younger ones, who are said to have reported their age and date of birth without difficulty, women who were said to have reported

their age "accurately" exhibited age heapings and distortions similar to those of women who were not able to give their date of birth or to report their age.
The survey age data exhibit the characteristic distortions found in most developing countries, and in Nigeria in particular. The distribution shows a bulge in age range 20-34, and this remains true even after controlling for education and migration status. Substantial upward shifts in age by persons under 20 to ages over 20, and to a less extent, downward shifts in age by persons over 35 are the most likely explanations for this bulge.
It appears therefore that although the future improvement in age reporting in Nigeria and the rest of the developing world will in the long run depend on improved literacy, in the short run, education of respondent may not significantly contribute to accurate age reporting, especially if the majority of the individuals still have illiterate parents who might have not bothered to register their children's birth dates or to whom registration facilities were not available when they had their children. It is suggested that improvement of vital registration would be the major factor leading to rapid improvement in age reporting.
