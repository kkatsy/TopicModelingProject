Erratum: Louis Munan and Anthea Kelly, "Frequencies of Fatal Congenital Anomalies of the Nervous System: Association with Latitude," Vol. 26, No. 4,1979

In Louis Munan and Anthea Kelly, "Frequencies of Fatal Congenital Anomalies of the Nervous System: Association with Latitude" (Social Biology 26: 335-340), an error in Table 1occurred as a result of Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and the corresponding proba-

bilities beginning in the first column (Latitude) instead of the second. In addition, five of the correlation coefficients should have shown a minus sign. We regret this typographical error and reproduce the corrected table on the following page.
