It has been fairly well established that census age statistics are often characterized by a number of deficiencies, the most common of which is a pronounced tendency for persons to "round-off" to certain preferred digits when reporting numerical data such as age or year of birth (Turner, 1958; Stockwell, 1966). This tendency leads to a marked pattern of "heaping" throughout an age distribution wherein there is an obvious overrepresentation of persons with ages or birth years ending in the preferred digits (0, S, and to a lesser extent 8), and an equally obvious underrepresentation of ages or birth years ending in the remaining digits (especially 9 and 1). Using data presented in Table 7 of the 1971 Demographic Yearbook of the United Nations, the present brief note examines the extent and pattern of digit preference/avoidance in some recent (post-1965) national population censuses.
MEASURING DIGIT PREFERENCE AND AVOIDANCE
The technique selected to measure the extent of digit preference/avoidance in age

reporting is the "blending" method described by Robert J. Myers (1940). A number of alternative measures for evaluating single year of age data were available, but were rejected for various reasons. Whipple's Index of Concentration, for example, tends to overstate the preference for ages ending in "0" because the effect of mortality in an "unblended" population would normally result in more people at ages ending in "0" than in the higher order digits (Shryock and Siegel, 1971, p. 206). Other summary indexes of digit preference, e.g., the Bachi index, the Carrier index, and the Ramachandran index, may have some slight theoretical advantages over the Myers index; but they are more laborious to compute and they differ little from Myers' in indicating the general extent of age heaping (Shryock and Siegel, 1971, p. 208).
Very briefly, the Myers technique derives a "blended" population which is essentially a weighted sum of the number of persons reporting ages ending in each of the ten terminal digits. The underlying assumption of this method is that if there are no systematic irregularities in the reporting

it indicates overselection of ages ending in that digit (digit preference). Conversely, a negative deviation (or a sum that is less than 10 per cent of the "blended" total) indicates underselection of ages ending in that digit (digit avoidance). An overall measure of the extent to which there is digit preference and/or avoidance in a census age distribution is the Index of Preference, which is obtained as one-half of the absolute sum of the deviations for each of the ten terminal digits.

suses in the non-European world, especially those of Africa and the Middle East.
THE PATTERN OF DIGIT PREFERENCE
Based on previous research, the expected pattern of digit preference and avoidance should reflect the tendency "to overreport digits which are multiples of the divisors of the base of the number system and underreport digits which are not multiples of the base of the number system" (Turner, 1958, p. 248). Since the base-ten system common to all post-primitive peoples has 10, 5, and 2 as divisors, preference should attach to ages ending in multiples of these numbers. Furthermore, it has been suggested more specifically by Turner (19S8) and verified by Stockwell (1966) that greatest preference should be shown to ages divisible by the base itself (i.e., ages ending in zero), whereas ages not divisible by 10 but divisible by 5 should rank second.
Overreporting should also characterize ages divisible by neither 10 nor 5 but divisible by 2. Ages ending in 2 or 8 should be selected more than those ending in 4 or 6 because the latter two flank the more preferred digit 5. Major avoidance should characterize ages ending in 1, 3, 7, or 9 (i.e., those digits that are not multiples of the divisors of the base of the number system) , with avoidance being especially pronounced for ages ending in 1 or 9, those numbers that flank the most highly preferred zero.
Thus, the following rank order of digit preference/avoidance would be expected to
occur:
0 (most preferred) 5 2,8 4,6 3,7 1,9 (most avoided)

Although there are a few exceptions, discussed below, the general pattern depicted in Table 2 conforms reasonably well to our expectations. A casual examination of this table clearly reveals that ages ending in 0 are selected far more often than ages ending in 5, the second most preferred digit. Among the remaining digits only 8 exhibits a majority of positive deviations; and the general pattern of underselection characterizing the other seven digits is clearly most pronounced for ages ending in 1.
Exceptions that prove the rule.--The most glaring exceptions to the expected pattern (e.g., the heaping at ages ending in 1 in Brunei; at ages ending in 8 in Gilbert and Ellice Islands; at ages ending in 7 and 0 in French Guiana; at ages ending in 9 in Southern Rhodesia and Zambia; and the greatest overselection of digit S rather than 0 in Iraq), actually represent additional confirmation of expectations. That is, they exhibit the expected pattern of heaping, but in relation to year of birth rather than attained age.
To illustrate, the marked preference for ages ending in digit 9 in Southern Rhodesia reflects heaping at years ending in 0 in response to a question on date of birth. This particular census was taken in June, 1969, and census age was determined simply as the difference between year of birth and year of the census, irrespective of exact date of birth. This distortion is most clearly evident at the youngest ages where the conversion of infants to one year of age, even though a particular infant might not have completed one month of life, results in a pronounced deficit in the under one year age group relative to succeeding categories (United Nations, 1972, p. 8). Among Southern Rhodesian Africans in 1969, for example, there were only 71,210 reported as under one year of age in contrast to 215,530 reported at age one (United Nations, 1972, p. 173).
