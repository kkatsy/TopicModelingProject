require that the new question beproperly interpreted andthat there be changes in registration practices that arenoteasy to make.

Comment on "The Changing SexRatio of the Navajo Tribe," by Kunitz and Slocumb
Ansley J. Coale
Office ofPopulation Research Princeton University Princeton, New Jersey

In their paper on "The ChangingSex Ratio of the Navajo Tribe" in theSpring 1976 issue ofSocial Biology (Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 33-44), Kunitz and Slocumb fail to note or discuss what is almost certainly the principal source of the anomalous sexratios in thevarious populations they mention, probably including the Navajos. The cause ofthe otherwise inexplicable figures is defective census data.
The sequence ofsex ratios by age inthe native population in the United States, when graphed for an early census, say around 1910, closely resembles the line traced by the sex ratio ofthe population of rural Colombia in Figure 5 oftheir article, a pattern also tobefound inthe nonwhite

population of the United States about 1930. The basis forsuch a sequence ofsex ratios, dipping well below 0.9 in adolescent and early adult ages andrising well above 1.0 in ages around SO to age 70 or higher, is differential omission and differential agemisreporting for males and females. Norealistic life tables incorporating differential mortality bysex couldaccount for this irregular sequence. In fact, the only set of sex ratios presented by Kunitz and Slocumb that appears to be based onvalid data is the set for Japan in Figure 1.There isreally no point in trying to find social and medical explanations for variations that are in fact mostly spurious.

figures are discussed in an article written in 1955 and in a book that was published in 1963 (A. J. Coale, "Population of the United States in 1950 Classified by Age, Sex, and Color," Journal of the American Statistical Association, 1955, Vol. 50, March, pp. 16-54; and A. J. Coale and M. Zelnik, New Estimates of Fertility and Population in the United States, Prince-

ton: Princeton University Press, 1963). Another pattern of spurious fluctuations
in sex ratios is found in Tropical Africa (and also in the censuses of many other populations in Asia and North Africa). See W. Brass et al. The Demography ofTropicalAfrica, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1968.
