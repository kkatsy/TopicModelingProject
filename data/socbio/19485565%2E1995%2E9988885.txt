ABSTRACT: This study examined the effect of maternal age on birth outcomes among young adolescents, ages 10 through 15. All records representing single births of primipara, Black or White adolescents, were selected for analysis from the 1983-1986 National Center for Health Statistics' Public Use Linked Live Birth-Infant Death Data File (n = 127,668). Logistic regression analyses controlled for effects of maternal race, marital status, prenatal care, gravidity, education, and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan residency. Univariate analyses indicated that the youngest adolescents were at greatest risk for negative birth outcomes including very preterm and preterm delivery, low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), and neonatal mortality. Logistic analyses showed similar results, with the exception that differences in SGA were insignificant. This study indicates the importance of examining age-specific birth outcomes among a population that has traditionally been studied in aggregate and underscores the need for increased prevention efforts.

The negative consequences of adolescent pregnancy in the United States are extensive, with social, psychological, economic, and medical ramifications (Furstenberg, 1987; McAnarney and Hendee, 1989; Rèedy, 1991; Schorr and Schorr, 1989; StevensSimon and White, 1991; Sweeney, 1989). The degree to which the consequences of pregnancy may vary by age among very young adolescents, however, is poorly described. In studies reporting on adolescent birth outcomes, researchers focus on a variety of differing and overlapping .age groups (Alexander et al., 1987; Babson and Clarke, 1983; Baldwin, 1980; Brown et al., 1991; Creatsas et al., 1991; Eisner et al., 1979; Felice et al., 1981; Furstenberg, 1987; Geronimus, 1986; Horon et al., 1983; Lee et al., 1988; Leppert et al., 1986; McCormick et al., 1984; Reedy, 1991; Santelli and Jacobson, 1990; Stevens-Simon and White,

1991; Sweeney, 1989). Furthermore, birth outcomes among young adolescents are typically reported in aggregate; individual ages are rarely examined (Baldwin, 1980; Geronimus, 1986; Santelli and Jacobson, 1990). These inconsistencies in age classification present difficulties in reviewing the literature and comparing study results.
Previous studies indicate that, compared to older women, adolescents are at increased risk for preterm delivery (Alexander et al., 1987; Brown et al., 1991; Leppert et al., 1986; Scholl et al., 1984); very low and low birth weight (Alexander et al., 1987; Brown et al., 1991; Eisner et al., 1979; Leppert et al., 1986; McCormick et al., 1984; Santelli and Jacobson, 1990); small birth weight for gestational age (Lee et al., 1988; Elster, 1984); neonatal mortality (Babson and Clarke, 1983); postneonatal mortality (Babson and Clarke,

1983); and infant mortality (Alexander et al., 1987). In contrast, others have found adolescent mothers to be at no greater risk for these same birth outcomes (Babson and Clarke, 1983; Brown et al., 1991; Creatsas et al., 1991; Horon et al., 1983; McCormick et al., 1984; Elster, 1984). Interpretation of the data from some of these studies is further limited since many do not control for potential confounding maternal characteristics (Alexander et al., 1987; Babson and Clarke, 1983; Brown et al., 1991; Creatsas et al., 1991; McCormick et al., 1984; Santelli and Jacobson, 1990; Scholl et al., 1984), and of those that do, differing sets of control variables are selected (Eisner et al., 1979; Elster, 1984; Horon et al., 1983; Lee et al., 1988; Leppert et al., 1986; Scholl et al., 1984). It is therefore difficult to determine whether poor birth outcomes among adolescent mothers are a direct result of young maternal age, biological immaturity, or rather a function of secondary maternal risk factors including sociodemographic and health characteristics.
This study examines birth outcomes among a cohort of young adolescent mothers for the following four age groups: 10 through 12 years, 13, 14, and 15 years of age. The purpose of this study is to determine, by using information available from vital records, whether or not maternal age among young adolescents has an independent effect on birth outcomes, including age-specific birth rates, gestational age, birth weight, birth weight for gestational age, and neonatal, postneonatal, and infant mortality. The independent effect of age on each of these outcome measures is assessed while

controlling for the effects of maternal race, marital status, prenatal care, gravidity, maternal educational attainment, and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan residency. The study hypothesizes that a pattern of increasingly poorer birth outcomes will emerge among the infants of this cohort of mothers, as maternal age decreases, thereby suggesting a relationship between maternal age and birth outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study uses data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS, 1991) Linked Birth-Infant Death Data Set, for the 1983 through 1986 birth cohort. All records representing single births of young adolescent mothers who were US residents, Black or White, and primíparas were chosen for analysis. Selected cases totaled 127,668 live births and 2,470 infant deaths. The study population was limited to mothers 10 through 15 years of age to identify significant differences in birth outcomes among these youngest mothers. Records of Black (n = 61,320) and White (« = 66,348) mothers were used, as preliminary birth frequencies among women of all other races were insufficient to calculate stable rates. Only primípara births were selected, since differences in birth weight (Selvin and Janerich, 1971; Sweeney, 1989), birth weight for gestational age (Elster, 1984), and infant mortality (Sweeney, 1989) have been found between adolescent primípara and multípara births. In addition, only single births were studied to control for any possible differences inherent in multiple births. Furthermore, 35

cases were excluded due to having grossly inconsistent age and years of completed education data, i.e., having an education level well above what would be expected for their age. A closer examination of these cases suggested that their reported age was in error.
Few births occurred among young adolescents 10-11 years of age (n = 108). Therefore, births to these age groups were combined with those occurring to 12-year-old mothers. Marital status at the time the mother gave birth was either married or not married. Prenatal care was categorized according to a modification of the Kessner Index, which incorporates the trimester prenatal care began, the number of prenatal care visits, and gestational age (Alexander and Comely, 1982; Kessner et al., 1973). Gravidity was either primigrávida (0 previous pregnancies) or multigravida (greater than or equal to 1previous pregnancy). Educational attainment was based on both the number of years of education and the age of the mother. If age was greater than or equal to 2 years older than would be expected for the number of school years completed, education status was defined as low. If age was within a plus or minus one year range of what would be expected for the number of school years completed, education status was average. And if age was 2-4 years below what would be expected for the number of school years completed, education status was high. Residency was either metropolitan (population greater than or equal to 250,000) or nonmetropolitan (less than 250,000). For the purposes of logistic regression analyses, the refer-

ence group consisted of mothers 15 years of age who were White, were married, had adequate prenatal care, had one or more previous pregnancies, had average educational attainment, and were nonmetropolitan residents.
The following definitions were used in evaluating birth outcome variables. Age-specific birth rates were calculated using 1983 through 1986 census data (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1987). Gestational age was measured as either very preterm (less than or equal to 32 weeks of gestation), moderately preterm (33-36 weeks), preterm (less than or equal to 36 weeks), term (37-41 weeks), or post-term (greater than or equal to 42 weeks). Birth weight was reported as very low (less than or equal to 1499 grams), moderately low (1500-2499 grams), low (less than or equal to 2499 grams), average (2500-4249 grams), or heavy (greater than or equal to 4250 grams). Infant weight for gestational age was reported as either small, average, or large, based on the criteria of Brenner (Brenner et al., 1976). Infants below the 10th percentile of birth weight for gestational age were small for gestational age (SGA); infants between the 10th and 90th percentile of birth weight for gestation age were average for gestational age (AGA); and infants above the 90th percentile of birth weight for gestational age were large for gestational age (LGA) (Brenner et al., 1976). Three measures of mortality were used. Neonatal mortality rates included infant deaths occurring within the first 27 days of life. Postneonatal mortality rates included deaths from 28 days through 11 months of life. And infant mortality rates included deaths

within the first year of life. All rates were calculated per 1,000 age-specific live births.
Descriptive statistics were used to determine the frequencies of births and deaths. Chi-square analyses were used to determine if an association existed between maternal age and the following outcome measures: gestational age, birth weight, birth weight for gestational age, and mortality rates. Logistic regression was used to determine the independent effect of maternal age on birth outcome, controlling for the effects of maternal race, marital status, prenatal care, gravidity, maternal educational attainment, and residency.
RESULTS
MATERNAL CHARACTERISTICS
Birth rates and sociodemographic characteristics differed significantly across age groups (Table 1). As maternal age increased, age-specific birth rates increased. A higher proportion of mothers 10 through 14 years of age were Black, while more than half of those 15 years of age were White. The oldest adolescents (15 years of age) were less likely than the other age groups to be not married and have inadequate prenatal care. This group was more likely to have low educational attainment, nonmetropolitan residency, one or more previous pregnancies, and have their child fathered by an adult. Findings concerning prenatal care, education, and father's age should be viewed cautiously, since greater than 10 per cent of the data were missing among the age cohorts.

BIRTH OUTCOMES
Birth outcomes differed significantly by maternal age (Table 2). The proportion of very preterm and moderately preterm deliveries decreased significantly as maternal age increased, although the proportion missing a gestational age value also decreased with maternal age. Similarly, as maternal age increased, the proportion of births that were very low and moderately low birth weight decreased, while the percentage of births that were normal birth weight increased. Compared to the older age groups, births to adolescents 10-12 years of age were more likely to be SGA, and the proportion of SGA births decreased as maternal age increased. As maternal age increased, neonatal and infant mortality decreased. Although this same trend appeared for postneonatal mortality, the difference was not significant.
INDEPENDENT EFFECTS OF MATERNAL
AGE ON BIRTH OUTCOMES
Based on the results of logistic regression analyses, a progressively increased risk of very preterm and preterm birth was observed for younger age groups when compared to the 15year-old group (Table 3). Other maternal factors that were independently and significantly associated with very preterm and preterm delivery included Black maternal race, being not married, inadequate and intermediate prenatal care, and metropolitan residency. In addition, low educational attainment was a risk factor for preterm delivery. Primigravidity was a protective factor against very preterm delivery.

attainment were risk factors. Being not married was protective of postneonatal mortality.
Healthy People 2000 lays out objectives, or "national opportunities" relating to maternal and infant health (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1991). Very young adolescents are at considerably greater risk for late initiation of prenatal care and several poor birth outcomes compared to both national target figures and baseline data for all women of reproductive age (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
For very young women who give birth in the United States, this study provides additional evidence for a link between maternal age and birth outcomes. For young mothers between the ages of 10 and 15, clear yearly incremental trends were demonstrated that showed increases in the extent of very preterm and preterm birth, very low and low birth weight, and neonatal mortality as maternal age decreased. Further, the data suggests that the most marked differentiation in outcomes occurs between the ages of 13 and 14 years. Despite possible differences in physical, psychosocial, and cognitive development between adolescents who are 10 and those who are 15 years of age, previous studies examining birth outcomes have typically categorized these young adolescents into a single age group. This study revealed disparities in risk, which until now have been masked in aggregate data.
Both preterm delivery and intrauterine growth retardation are precursors to low birth weight. While logistic regression analyses showed significant

differences in preterm delivery among young adolescents, no significant differences were found in birth weight for gestational age (SGA). It appears, therefore, that the increased risk of very low and low birth weight found in this study among the youngest adolescents can be largely attributed to preterm delivery. These data, however, should be viewed cautiously due to the high proportion of missing data on gestational age measures, especially in the younger age groups. In addition, the accuracy of the data that is reported may be problematic. Because they have been found to experience more vaginal bleeding in their first trimester, inaccurate reporting of the last menstrual period has been shown to be more likely among girls who are closer to the time of menarche when they become pregnant (Stevens-Simon, Roghmann, McAnarney, 1991).
This study showed that neonatal and infant mortality rates increased as maternal age decreased, but did not show a similar trend for postneonatal mortality. Infants of these younger mothers are no more likely to die in the postneonatal period, suggesting that exogenous factors impacting infant survival beyond the first month of life may not vary by maternal age.
A trend showing higher proportions of inadequate prenatal care utilization as maternal age decreased was also observed. Given the propensity for infants of younger mothers to suffer poorer birth outcomes, efforts to identify very young pregnant women and to intervene early in their pregnancies with intensive prenatal care, appear crucial.
Primigravidity was found to be protective against poor birth outcomes

The use of secondary data gathered from vital records has inherent limitations, including only a narrow range of available information. Previous studies have controlled for the effects of one or more of the following: alcohol, buying power, hypertension, infant's sex, interpregnancy interval, labor onset, maternal height, parity, payment status, prepregnancy weight, reproductive history, smoking, toxemia, weight gain, and ward status (Eisner et al., 1979; Elster, 1984; Horon et al., 1983; Lee et al., 1988; Leppert et al., 1986; Scholl et al., 1984). While this study points to young maternal age as a risk factor for several poor birth outcomes, these additional variables require attention as well.
From both a clinical and a public health perspective, it is important to identify and address the etiology of preterm delivery among very young adolescents in order to prevent preterm birth and subsequent low birth weight and neonatal mortality. With 30 per cent of the youngest adolescents, and 19 per cent of those 15 years of age delivering infants preterm, it is critical to establish a risk profile to help explain who is at increased risk and why. While the prédéterminants of preterm birth are in all likelihood multifactorial, prevention and intervention efforts should be developed to target specific predisposing mechanisms, such as smoking, infection, etc. (Fuchs et al., 1993). To the extent that gynecological or anatomical immaturity of very young adolescents creates biological limits that prohibit young adolescents from carrying a pregnancy to term, the appropriate intervention may be different than if preterm delivery among these young mothers is

more often related to environmental factors. Given the current paucity of knowledge regarding the etiology of preterm labor and delivery (Kramer et al., 1992), a combination of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention efforts are indicated that would strive to reduce unwanted pregnancy in young adolescents, to intervene early in pregnancy through prenatal care efforts aimed at improving the prospects of a good outcome, and to assure the availability of an appropriate level of postdelivery medical care to decrease preventable mortality.
Findings from this study indicated a higher risk of poor birth outcomes involving gestational age and neonatal mortality in metropolitan (areas with 250,000 or more residents) versus nonmetropolitan (areas with less than 250,000 residents) areas. Because the vital records used in this study do not provide more precise measures of residency in terms of population size, it is difficult to interpret these results. Further investigation of the influence of urban residency on preterm birth and neonatal mortality among very young women who give birth in the United States is needed.
A primary public health response to young adolescent pregnancy is essential. The significant discrepancies in birth outcomes among young adolescents, which, until now were lost in aggregate data, highlight the need for pregnancy prevention strategies to be inclusive of the youngest adolescents. Although the birth rate among the youngest mothers is relatively small, these births reflect only a portion of pregnancies to young adolescents. Furthermore, these births represent only a portion of adolescents who are sexually

active. Clearly, primary prevention efforts to reduce adolescent pregnancies must begin with children, before they reach puberty. Currently, most schoolbased family life and sexuality education efforts are focused on youth in 7th through 12th grades (Kenney et al., 1989). This is too late for those who become sexually active prior to junior high. In addition, a timely schoolbased curriculum is only a partial solution. This strategy must be coupled with a multitude of interventions that are focused on the individual, group, community, and societal levels. Family planning services must be established that are available, appropriate, accessible, affordable, and acceptable to young adolescents. These services should be multidisciplinary, addressing issues of sexuality and pregnancy prevention from a developmental, psychosocial, cultural, and medical perspective.
The results of this study also support the need for secondary prevention programs relating to birth outcomes of young adolescents. To provide appropriate care, age-specific risks must be identified, and secondary prevention efforts must be based on this understanding of risk. As indicated, the disparity of risk for poor birth outcomes is significant among young adolescents at individual years of age. In addition, as maternal age decreases, inadequate prenatal care increases. Young adolescents need to be educated about the benefits of prenatal care. Furthermore, they need to be connected with appropriate social and medical services both before and after delivery. Health and social service practices must be sensitive to the increased needs of these young mothers, their infants, and the

fathers of these infants, and address issues specific to their health, social, cognitive, and physical needs.
As long as very young adolescents continue to be at greater risk for extremely poor birth outcomes, tertiary interventions addressing the multiple needs of these infants and children must be implemented. Infants born preterm and at low birth weight are at increased risk for an array of complex medical problems (Peterson, 1988). Those born very preterm and very low birth weight are at even greater risk for requiring long, complicated, and exorbitantly expensive treatment. Further, chronic health conditions may result that require life-long interventions (Brown et al., 1980). Psychosocial and educational needs of children born at very low birth weights are just now being recognized, as these children are entering the school system and requiring special educational services (Abel-Smith and Knight-Jones, 1990).
This study found very young adolescents to be at increased risk for a host of poor birth outcomes. These discrepancies in risk are exacerbated when compared to those of older adolescents and women. Given both the human and financial costs of very young adolescent births, an extensive public health response is in order. Foremost is the call for primary prevention.
