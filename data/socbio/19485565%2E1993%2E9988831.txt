ABSTRACT: We extended the biosocial model of problem behavior tested by Udry (1990) to a panel design, following a sample of over one hundred boys in adolescence for three years. We found the expected results for sociological variables, but weaker effects for testosterone than Udry found on cross-sectional data. Using panel models with lagged hormone effects, we identified relationships between Time-1 testosterone and problem behavior one year or more later. The relationship between testosterone and problem behavior was not present for subsequent measures of testosterone, either in cross-section or with time-lagged models. Therefore we cannot interpret the results as showing testosterone effects on problem behavior. Rather it appears that testosterone level in early adolescence is a marker for a more general growth trajectory of early development.

In a recent paper, Udry (1990) presented a biosocial model of male adolescent problem behaviors in which he showed that an empirical model based on integrating biological and sociological theories of problem behavior gave both a better prediction of behavior and a quite different picture of the causes of problem behavior than a model based on either theory alone. That paper was based on crosssectional data. The present paper extends the first study to a panel analysis of a different sample. While the present study partially replicates the results of the first study, it comes to entirely different conclusions.
For the convenience of the reader, we summarize the theoretical model from the first paper. For the sociological model we rely on social control theory as exemplified by Hirschi's (1969) theory. Hirschi maintains that everyone is motivated to commit devi-

ant acts, and that what needs to be explained is why, in the face of motivation, some do not. Hirschi maintains that deviant acts are committed when an individual loosens his/her bonds to conventional society. Such bonds include (1) emotional attachment to conventional institutions (school, church, etc.); (2) commitment to conventional behavior; (3) involvement with conventional institutions; and (4) conventional beliefs.
Jessor and Jessor (1977) include very similar constructs in their problem behavior model of adolescence. They have documented such changes as increased value of independence, decreased religiosity, decline in church attendance, lower academic achievement values, and increased tolerance for violation of adult standards. Jessor and Jessor also guide the definition of the dependent variable in our study: the age-graded norm violations of

adolescence, including smoking cigarettes, having sex, drinking alcohol, and similar behaviors.
While the sociological model takes motivation for granted and focuses on the constraints, the biological model focuses on the differences in motivation for problem behaviors. In this sense the two theories are complementary rather than contradictory. The biological model hypothesizes that "male" hormones increase the predisposition of adolescents to problem behavior. The specific androgenic hormone of focus is testosterone, the most behaviorally potent male hormone. It has been proposed that the dramatic increases in testosterone in adolescent males may provide an explanation of the corresponding sharp rise in deviance for which sociological models fail to account (Hirschi and Gottfriedson, 1985; Gove, 1985). The link between testosterone and a variety of normviolating behaviors (aggression, sexual behavior, anti-social acts, and dominance) has been the subject of two decades of research (Udry, 1988; Kruetz and Rose, 1972; Olweus et al., 1980; among others).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS
One hundred twenty-six boys age 12 and 13 were randomly selected from a list of pupils in a public-school system of a medium-sized southern city. The school district was selected based upon the availability of a list of pupils. About 50 per cent of those eligible agreed to participate and completed the study. Informed consent was first obtained from a parent, then from the respondent. Subjects were paid a cash

incentive of $400 (maximum) for their participation.
PROCEDURE
The respondents were followed for a period of three years. Subjects were administered a questionnaire at first contact and every six months thereafter for two years. A final follow-up was conducted at the end of the third year. Nurse/interviewers administered the questionnaire, collected blood samples, and performed physical examinations for measures of pubertal development.
Collection, storage, and assay of blood samples. --Blood samples were collected at six-month intervals, for a total of six sampling periods for each subject. The samples were collected in the subjects' homes between 3 and 7 P.M. by a nurse. Because there are short-term pulsatile releases of certain hormones into the blood, collection was made using a butterfly needle inserted in a suitable arm vein and obtaining three 6-ml samples at 15minute intervals. The three samples were immediately pooled and the serum separated. The serum was then stored at - 7 0 C until assay.
Testosterone assays were performed using the Diagnostics Products Corporation 1125 Coat-a-Count kit. Testosterone binding globulin (SHBG) assays were performed using the Farmos Diagnostica 1125 kit. All samples were assayed in duplicate and, for a subset of the specimens, were crossvalidated against values generated from two other labs. (See Halpern and Udry, forthcoming, for a description of the validation process.)

A simple biological model.--The biological model was constructed by completing a backward elimination multiple regression of all biological variables predicting problem behavior across all three time periods and subsequently at each time period, deleting variables until all remaining were significant at the 0.10 level. Each deleted variable was then re-entered singly with the remaining variables to see if it met the entry criterion. Each resultant model is illustrated in Table 2.
Testosterone is the only biological variable that significantly predicted problem behavior across the three time periods. While testosterone itself does not significantly predict at all three time periods, it is the best biological predictor and is thus the lone variable included in the biological model.
A simple biosocial model.--The biosocial model was constructed by

completing a backward elimination multiple regression of the biological and social model variables predicting problem behavior across all three time periods and subsequently at each time period, deleting variables until all remaining were significant at the 0.10 level. Each deleted variable was then re-entered singly with the remaining variables to see if it met the entry criterion. Each resultant model is illustrated in Table 3.
As indicated in the table, all three model variables significantly contribute to an overall model spanning the three time periods. The results of each individual time period are less supportive of the inclusion of testosterone in the model. Testosterone appears predictive only at Time 1 for the adolescents, and not at any subsequent time periods. Such findings suggest the completion of a lagged path analysis.

A time-lagged integrated model.-- Separate analyses were conducted to determine if a lagged biosocial model would better predict problem behavior. It was speculated that the effects of testosterone would be most evident on later problem behaviors, and that these effects could be mediated through the

social variables of religiosity and autonomy. Therefore, lagged path analyses were completed using Time-1 testosterone, and Time-3 religiosity and autonomy, predicting Time-3 problem behavior. The resultant path model is shown in Figure 1. As indicated in the figure, testosterone effects are not

However, other time-lagged models were also completed using a one-year lag for testosterone effects on problem behavior. None of the lagged analyses beyond Time 1 were found to besignificant. In fact, further exploration indicated that only Time-1 testosterone had any effect on later problem behavior and that itsrelationship toproblem behavior remained marginallysignificant at even Time 5 (r = 0.171, p< 0.110). Thus, high testosterone at an early age is predictive of problem behavior for uptothree years later,but later testosterone levels arenotpredictive.
DISCUSSION
A comparison of the results of the present study with those of Udry (1990) show two quite different pic-

tures. In the first paper, the separate biological andsociological models each have an R2 of 0.24, while the biosocial model has an R2 of 0.30, a significant increase over the separate models. In the present study, the sociological model has an R2 of 0.29 for the first round, but the biological model, while significant, shows only a minor hormone effect, with an R2 of 0.06. The biosocial model explains no more variance than thesociological model alone. Cross-sectional results for subsequent rounds show nobiological effects at all.
The panel model for a one year lag in hormone effects beginning with Time 1 (Figure 1) shows a more substantial testosterone effect, along with about equal effects for each of the two sociological variables. Butone-year lag models beginning with testosterone for any other round show no hormone effects at all. At the same time, Round-1 testosterone predicts problem behavior at allsubsequent rounds, even up to three years later. It is therefore impossible to identify the relationship between testosterone andsubsequent behavior as a hormone effect.
