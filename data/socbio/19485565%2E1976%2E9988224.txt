An Unusual live-birth Sex Ratio in Ecuador

In his study of the Peruvian village of Nunoa, Baker (1969) reports "the sex ratio was highly unusual in that there was a large number of excess males." Specifically, for a sample of 608 children born to 136 women, he records a sex ratio of 124. In this note I want to call the attention of human biologists to a village in Ecuador that may manifest this phenomenon of a male-skewed sex ratio in an even more extreme form.
The town of Oyacachi is a settlement of peasantized Indians, some of whom are still monolingual in Quechua, located about 40 kilometers due east of Quito. As of 1967, the population (excluding a school teacher, a teniente politico and his son, and a storekeeper and her son, all of whom were white Ecuadorian nationals) was enumerated in a locally conducted census as 179 persons.
Located as it is on the eastern slope of the Andes, at an altitude of nearly 3,000 meters, the town has always been difficult to reach and unattractive to white colonization. In the spring of 1969, when I visited the town for several months of ethnographic field work, the easiest route to Oyacachi was a full day's horseback ride across the Andean divide.
The original vegetation, still present in large parts of the environs, is cloud forest. The people raise about half their own food and earn the money to buy the rest, as well

as all their tools, clothes, etc., by a cottage industry--the hand carving of large wooden spoons, bowls, and trays.
In the course of my field work, I examined the civil register of the town, which had been established as a separate register only in 1959. In the ten years in which the register had been maintained, there had been 77 live births, of which 27 were female and 50 were male, yielding a sex ratio of 185.2.
It is important to stress that this figure refers to the sex ratio at birth and not to the total population. A fair number of cases of extreme sex ratios have been collected by Salzano (1972). However, all these cases refer to total populations and thus could be the result of female infanticide (ethnographically known for some of these groups), differential survival, and differential emigration.
Of these complicating factors, only female infanticide could have affected the Oyacachi data. I am satisfied that infanticide is not a valid explanation of the skewed sex ratio for the following reasons:
1. Oyacachi has been Catholic for centuries and has normal Catholic peasant values in regard to this practice.
2. The teniente politico, who had been resident in the town for a good many years and was generally well regarded, would almost certainly have become aware of any systematic infanticide. However, he attributed the sex ratio to unknown causes.

The conformance improves regularly as family size goes up, and in no case is the alpha less than about 0.5. There is nosuggestion that the proclivity for an excess of males is concentrated in a few families; the ratio seems to be remarkably regular through-

The economic opportunities attendant upon the road traffic, and the oil wealth itself, will almost certainly accelerate the emigration from thevillage which had already begun when I visited sixyears ago.
