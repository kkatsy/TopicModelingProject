Could the finding by Andrew (Social Biology, 1976, Vol. 23, pp. 168-171) that male delinquents come from larger sibships than female delinquents result from failing to control for age of the delinquent? There is some possibility that the delinquencies of males become more severe, and are so regarded, as they grow older, whereas the delinquencies of females, more heavily concentrated in categories such as ungovernability, runaway, and

sexuality, are regarded as more severe the younger the girl. These tendencies could bias the selection of juvenile offenders of each sex for official processing in opposite directions. Since age of parent would be positively correlated with age of child, the older parents of males would have had more opportunity to have additional children than the younger parents of females. Can Andrew provide data on age?

Gordon has suggested a possible explanation for the finding that male delinquents come from larger families than female delinquents (Andrew, 1976). Boys might have been older than girls when they entered the delinquent sample, be-

cause of differing sex-role expectations. Older children (boys) would have more siblings, creating a spurious relationship between sex and family size, actually due to a relationship between sex and age.

offenses of males have been rated as more violent than those of females, within the same population (Andrew, 1974).
(b) Contrary to Gordon's hypothesis, males were not significantly older than females (means, 16.02, 15.80; SD'S, 1.94, 1.S9; F(l,180) < 1, n.s.).
(c) Contrary to Gordon's expectation, older delinquents did not have more siblings than younger delinquents, either overall or within ethnic subgroups (F's <
1). (d) Partially supporting Gordon's hy-
pothesis, two of the four ethnic subgroups (Chicanos and "Others," mostly immigrants) showed the expected effect (boys older than girls) (16.17 years versus 14.62,

F (1,27) = 3.97, p < 0.10). Larger crosscultural samples may demonstrate possible effects of "traditional" cultures on sexrole stereotypes. Chicanos in San Diego, close to Mexico, and "Others," fresh from the "old countries," apparently differ from the California-influenced majority (Anglos and Blacks) who showed no age effect by sex.
Cultural comparisons of Gordon's model may well find keys to understanding the large-family effect. But the main point here is that, regardless of whether or not an ethnic subgroup shows a sex-age effect, the large-family effect works across all ethnic groups so far tested. More research is needed.
