ABSTRACT: Secondary sex ratio (SSR) values in excess of 109 male for every 100 female livebirths have been reported from several Micronesian populations. Analyses of linked family records dating from before 1942 for the native people of Guam reveal a highly masculinized SSR even at high birth orders and parental ages of married fertile couples. These findings contrast with reported declines in SSR with parity and parental age among historical and modern populations in Europe and North America where such declines often have been ascribed to the effects of decreasing mean coital frequencies associated with marital duration and spousal age. This study challenges implicit assumptions about the supposed universality of Euroamerican patterns of marital sexual behavior and supports the coital frequency hypothesis of SSR determination.

The proportion of males to females, more readily ascertained than an accurate age composition of many anthropological populations, has long attracted the attention of anthropologists and demographers. Even rough estimates of age categories along with knowledge of the sex structure of human populations have been used to seek insights into past lifeways, differential migration, and/or mortality experiences responsible for the observed distribution of the age cohorts, by gender, composing an entire group. Krzywicki (1934, p. 230), for example, argued that the greater surplus of adult females among the maritime Chukchee demonstrated the more dangerous lifeways of adult males who followed a maritime subsistence pattern than those of their reindeer-hunting kinsmen. A marked paucity of females, particularly in younger age groups, may suggest that a society has practiced female infanticide, while a relative deficit of males and females born

in many parts of the world a few years before 1920 is likely to be ascribed to the effects of the influenza pandemic of the same period.
Underlying these exercises and estimates is the assumption of a basic, slightly masculinized near-uniformity in the secondary sex ratio, the relative proportions of males and females at birth. Based on analyses of comprehensive and complete registrations covering millions of births in Europe and the United States, the secondary sex ratio is usually reported as more than 105 males born for every 100 females (SSR = > 105), according to Parkes (1976), inter alia. Slight variations--as in the lower SSR among African-Americans in the United States, as a result of random fluctuations observed in small-scale groups or over brief periods of observation, in the offspring of mothers who smoke, of parents afflicted with certain diseases or with certain blood group combinations, or, temporarily, in the offspring

of returning war veterans--are often seen as minor aberrations from the basic universality of the phenomenon, useful mainly in attempting to elucidate the underlying responsible mechanisms. Indeed, observed deviations may even be used to question the accuracy and/or completeness of birth registrations, as in the recent case of the One Percent Survey of China for 1987 (Hull, 1990). Willigan and Lynch (1982, p. 65) warn that "any sex ratio over 1.10 (derived from baptismal records) may be sufficient to call into serious question the completeness of the registration of female births, if such a ratio lasts over a period of years."
Understanding of the basic mechanism of male sex determination (inheritance of the Y chromosome, or, more specifically, the sry gene carried on that chromosome) has been accompanied by increasingly refined techniques for identifying the chromosomal or genetic sex of aborted embryos and fetuses. However, since many products of conception may be lost and undiscovered in the earliest days after fertilization, it is virtually impossible to estimate satisfactorily the primary sex ratio (PSR), the relative proportion of male to female conceptions. Accordingly, any differences in the SSR among diverse populations are assumed not to reflect significant variations in the PSR or the underlying physiological processes surrounding fertilization.
In his comprehensive review of the subject, James (1978a, p. 730) notes a "substantial body of evidence that there are birth order, paternal age, and possibly maternal age effects on sex ratio. . . ." He hypothesizes (James 19876, p. 873) that "hormone levels of

both parents at the time of conception affect the probability of a male birth, high levels of estrogen and testosterone increasing this probability, and high levels of gonadotropin decreasing it." As he has pointed out, high coital rates over the course of the female cycle should ensure that sperm are present in the vaginal tract in the midcycle, when estrogen and testosterone levels peak, and in the late-cycle when gonadotropin levels drop. Thus, it is surprising that James does not call for further investigations of associations between coital rates and sex ratio in his plea for additional testing of this hypothesis (James, 1990). The present study is, however, in part a response to his call to other workers to test the hypothesis "in whatever way is open to them" and, in part, to add to the ethnodemographic literature materials relating to Pacific island populations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The present study is based on data derived from a linked family record register for the native population of Guam covering the period prior to the beginning of World War II hostilities in this part of the Pacific. These materials, more fully described elsewhere (Underwood 1990Ö), include 38,884 individual records. However, many of the results shown below, as indicated, derive from a separate set of reproductive histories for 4,177 couples whose marriages were registered between 1901 and October 1941. Of these, 3,406 unions had produced over 18,000 offspring by the end of the period, and the reproductive histories of 3,317 first-married women were included.

DISCUSSION
The role of coital frequency as a significant proximate determinant has long been recognized in frameworks for the study of human fertility (Davis and Blake, 1956; Bongaarts and Potter, 1983; Wood 1990; inter alia). Surveys, almost all among European and American populations, report declining mean frequencies of sexual intercourse with age and with marital duration (Leridon, 1977), but the possible effects of declining female fecundabil-

ity and increasing levels of spontaneous abortions in older mothers have been the major foci of interest in studies of secondary infertility. In order to reconcile the observed decline among Euroamericans in sex ratio of offspring born to older parents and/or in marriages of longer duration, it also has been necessary to assume higher levels of intrauterine loss among male conceptuses (Parkes, 1976; Mealey and Mackey, 1990). Sieff's review (1990) reveals that this latter assumption is highly problematic, however. In any case, studies among non-Western groups seem generally to have assumed the universality of the Euroamerican

I have previously (1990a) reported for the historic Chamorro population low levels (6.6 per cent) of marital infertility and relatively high levels of extramarital (22 per cent) and premarital (ca. 32 per cent) fertility. The present study reveals that a relatively late age at marriage of fertile women (21.9 years) was accompanied by advanced maternal age at time of last reported birth. Among 1,012 final livebirths to married women born before 1895, over 70 per cent (N = 717) were reported for women aged 35 years or older, with 45 per cent of all final parturitions occurring to women in their 40's and 50's. For married fathers born before 1895, 59.5 per cent (N = 755) of 1,269 ith order offspring were born to fathers 40 years of age or older. On this evidence

alone, it is clear that levels of marital intercourse remained high throughout the pre- and peri-menopausal periods, when female fecundity was expectably declining and the probability of fetal loss may have been increasing.
As discussed elsewhere, prevailing sociocultural patterns encouraged high levels of marital sexual activity and reproduction among Chamorros, almost all of whom were adherents of the Roman Catholic religion during this period. Anecdotal and ethnographic evidence indicate a high value was placed on continuing sexual activity of married men and women and on the rearing of large families. Heterogeneity in actual practice and in fecundability are suggested by the declining SSR among those with middle range (6-9)
