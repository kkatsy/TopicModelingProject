Beginning in the latter part of the nineteenth century, the birth rate of the United States black population began a steady decline which continued until the late 1930's (see Figure 1). Demographers have offered various explanations in trying to account for this trend and for the conspicuously low natality of urban blacks during this period. Perhaps the most widely accepted analysis is anchored to the traditional social mobility and demographic transition hypotheses which are normally associated with the shift from high to low fertility in rapidly developing societies. However, due to data limitations, general lack of investigation, and some perhaps accountable deviations (e.g., fertility fell before mortality) from the more common patterns, this is not yet established as a wholly adequate explanation. Indeed, caution is further warranted by the fact that black fertility increased rapidly after this period despite the presence of demographic changes ordinarily associated with the persistence of low fertility, such as an increasing proportion of urban residents and improvements in the educational and economic condition of blacks.
Another explanation for this trend places major emphasis on fecundity changes. Essentially, this view contends that during

the period 1880-1936 health conditions deteriorated within both rural and urban Negro communities, thereby reducing the reproductive potential of the black population. Within this context, changes in the prevalence of venereal disease are often singled out as possibly the major cause of the fertility decline and as particularly relevant to the low urban rates.
Venereal disease is no stranger to demographic literature. Variations in fecundity, attributed to the differential prevalence of venereal disease, are a common explanation for marked differences in the fertility levels of African regions. For example, Romaniuk (1961) claims to have found evidence supporting this hypothesis in his Congolese study, concluding that VD is responsible for the high rates of sterility. However, in other similar studies, such as that of Roberts and Tanner (1959) in Northeast Tanganyika, medical examinations failed to reveal any such relationship.
With respect to the history of the American black population, the venereal disease explanation is residual, usually introduced in a speculative fashion when other evidence proves insufficient. Thus, in 1933, while trying to explain the causes of the decline in Negro births, Whelpton and Thompson (1933, p. 284) could only ask the question,

"Have the specific birth rates declined because of disease (particularly venereal)?" No body of data then existed upon which to base a conclusive answer. Recently, Kiser, Grabill, and Campbell (1968, p. 57) devoted only a sentence to the subject, stating in a similar discussion, "A frequent and a plausible explanation was the high rate of venereal infection among Negroes in large cities," indicating that little is still known about the history of venereal disease and its relationship to black fertility.
Despite the absence of hard data about VD and fecundity changes in the black population, it is possible to go beyond mere

speculation and suggestion to areas of circumstantial evidence concerning these variables and their relationship. To my knowledge, the only detailed effort in this direction is the work of Reynolds Farley. In Growth of the Black Population (1970, p. 243), he examines variables that might be used to explain the black fertility decline between 1880 and 1936 and concludes, "As far as we can detect, this decrease was chiefly brought about, not by changes in marital patterns or the increased use of contraceptives, but by alternations in health conditions which were unfavorable to fecundity." The principal fertility-inhibiting

pathologies which Farley studies are pellagra and venereal disease. He gathers information from related studies, medical opinion, and other sources and infers that venereal disease became more prevalent in this period and helped to cut the birth rate. Further, he suggests that the number of births averted due to venereal disease was significantly reduced as a result of improvements in health conditions specifically related to VD beginning in the mid 1930's. Thus, Farley sees changes in venereal disease prevalence as an important determinant of the fertility decline before the Depression and the following rise in the birth rate.
This paper will examine some of the arguments used to support this conclusion and will offer a more conservative interpretation regarding the importance of venereal disease as it relates to the history of the black population.
ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION
The general argument which Farley presents is the following. No mention of venereal disease exists in the accounts of slave life, so VD prevalence was probably very low before 1865. There are indications that venereal disease may have become more common among blacks between 1880 and 1936. The rise in VD prevalence would help explain the long-run trend toward a lower birth rate because VD impairs fertility. Beginning in 1935, new government VD control programs and superior treatment methods enabled the black population to increase its natality by reducing the impact of VD. These developments principally account for the rise in black fertility which began in 1936.
Three questions with respect to the above argument warrant special attention:
1. Did VD actually become more prevalent between 1880 and 193S?
2. Was the sudden rise in fertility around

1936 preceded by the effective control of VD in the black population? 3. What was the quantitative physiological impact of VD on black fertility?
DID VD BECOME MORE PREVALENT, 1880-1935?
PREVALENCE DATA
The first question which must be asked is, did the prevalence of VD increase enough between the late nineteenth century and 1936 to account for the observed fertility decline? A common source of historical morbidity data is the military service health examination records of recruits. By the end of World War I, approximately 7.5% of men between the ages of 18 and 35 were venereally infected (Siler, 1943, p. 100). From this figure, experts estimated that possibly 10% of the U.S. population had some VD infection (Brown et al., 1970). As gonorrhea is approximately three times as prevalent as syphilis (Parran, 1937, p. 6),1 it is likely that 2.5% of the population had syphilis while 7.5% had gonorrhea. (These separate figures are probably understated since persons with both infections are counted only once.) The Public Health Service, on the basis of tests for the first two million men recruited in World War II, estimated that 2.5% of the total U.S. population were infected with some stage of syphilis at that time (Brown et al., 1970, p. 59). Figures for gonorrhea are not available. From meager evidence such as this, it is possible to draw only the weakest of conclusions. The duplicate 2.5% syphilis prevalence rates for the two dates suggest that syphilis prevalence did not change to any large extent during the period for the total population.
But what about the black population
1 This figure is an estimate for the total population and may not hold for various subgroups within the population. In the black population, for example, where the prevalence of syphilis is 250/1,000 among adults, a prevalence figure for gonorrhea three times greater is most improbable.

alone? In Growth oj the Black Population (1970), Farley reports that 6.5% of the black recruits in World War I and 27.2% in World War II had a positive sérologie test for syphilis (p. 226).2 He argues that this suggests that the prevalence of syphilis increased. Yet he is reserved, recognizing that neither sample was random, that recruiting procedures probably changed, and that new sérologie tests of greater sensitivity and specificity were devised during this period.3
Moroeover, Farley's attempt to show that VD prevalence increased from 6.5% to 25.2% between 1918 and 1940 damages his argument that an increase in VD prevalence was an important determinant in the trend toward lower fertility rates. Almost 80% of the black fertility decline between 1880 and 1936 occurred prior to 1918. It is unlikely that an increase of only several percentage points in prevalence prior to 1918 would account for 80% of the fertility decline, while an increase of nineteen points after 1918 would be responsible for only 20% of the decline.
In summary, it is difficult to infer from these sources that VD prevalence increased anywhere near four-fold between 1918 and 1940. A considerably lower figure seems likely.
It should be noted that data on morbidity and mortality due to venereal disease are difficult to obtain and of poor quality. Venereal diseases are notoriously underregistered for obvious reasons. There are several studies which estimate the completeness of the syphilis mortality rate and show it to be as low as 51% (Brown et al.,
2Actually, the 6.5 and 27.2% figures are not comparable. The 6.5% figure refers to black recruits (David, 1949, p. 240), while the 27.2% figure refers to all black males age 21-35. The comparable figure for black recruits is a lower 25.2% (Vonderlehr and Usilton, 1942, p. 1372).
8Although probably not as important, these observations are also pertinent to the above indication of prevalence in the total population.

1970, p. 103). The relative degree of underregistration for the white versus the black population remains unknown. However, it is suspected that whites are underregistered to a greater extent than blacks which would artificially inflate the difference between the two groups.
It is probable that physicians are more prone to report a diagnosis of venereal disease for patients of lower economic status than for patients of higher economic status where the embarrassment of the patient or his family is more likely to be a consideration. The Philadelphia Board of Health in the late 1930's asked that private patients be reported by number while the poor who frequented dispensaries be reported by name and address (Pelouze, 1939, p. 467). A survey conducted by the American Social Health Association in 1962 suggests that only 10 to 15% of all primary and secondary syphilis cases diagnosed by private physicians are reported (Brown et al., 1970, p. 63). Coupled with the fact that more blacks frequent public clinics which must report all cases of venereal disease, it is clear that the usual eleven-fold prevalence difference between blacks and whites is an overstatement. A recent National Health Examination Survey reported reactive sérologie tests in 2.2% of the white adults and 19.3 of the black adults, indicating syphilis to be about nine times more prevalent among Negroes (U.S. Public Health Service, 1965, p. 6).
URBAN-RURAL DIFFERENTIALS
Farley presents data that indicate that mortality rates from syphilis were higher in cities than in rural areas and that the differential increased after 1910. He states as follows (1970, pp. 225-226).
In both the Death Registration States of 1910 and in all registration states, the [nonwhite] mortality rate from syphilis increased during the 192O's and 1930's and this reached a peak toward the end of that

6

decade. Thereafter this death rate fell, slowly at first and then more rapidly during the late 1940's.
Most blacks who lived in the Death Registration States of 1910 lived in cities. Since the death rate in this fixed area was higher than the syphilis death rate for the entire Death Registration Area, we have an indication that mortality from this cause was more common in cities than in rural areas and that, within cities, this mortality increased after 1910.
This information suggests that syphilis was
more common in urban than in rural areas
after 1910. Thus, if the urban rates were
higher, the progressive urbanization of
blacks after 1910 would mean an increasing
prevalence of syphilis for the race.
However, an inspection of black syphilis
data by place of residence indicates that
urbanization did not significantly increase
the prevalence of syphilis in the black pop-
ulation. The most accurate data on urban-
rural syphilis rates come from the study by
Vonderlehr and Usilton (1942, pp. 1369-
1372) on 1,895,778 inductees and volun-
teers for World War II through August 31,
1941. Men from forty-four states and the
District of Columbia were considered.
Idaho, Kentucky, Oregon, and Vermont did
not use the standard form; the data from
these states were incomplete and therefore
not included. Only forms on white and
Negro men age 21-35 of known residence
were used.
From the observed syphilis rates, the authors constructed corrected rates4 to in-
clude all white and Negro men age 21-35
by state and by urban-rural residence. Of
the men actually examined, 45.3 per thou-
sand tested positively for syphilis. The
white rate was 17.4 per thousand and the

Negro rate was 252.3 per thousand (or 25.2% as quoted earlier). Since the majority of the men were young recruits, and since syphilis prevalence increases with age, the corrected rates for all men 21-35 exceeded the observed. The corrected rate was 23.5 per thousand for whites and 272.0 per thousand for blacks. Thus, for whites, the observed rate was 17.4 and the corrected rate, 23.5. For Negroes, the observed rate was 252.3 and the corrected rate, 272.0.
The corrected urban and rural rates for the black population were 290.2 and 252.8 per thousand, respectively. Thus, the urban rate was only 15% higher than the rural rate in 1940. The proportion of blacks living in urban areas increased from 23% in 1900 to 49% in 1940, a redistribution of 26 percentage points (Farley, 1970, p. 50). Since only an additional quarter of the black population became subject to the 15% greater urban rate, the syphilis prevalence for the entire black population probably increased by less than 4% as a result of urbanization.
The explanation for such a limited effect stems from the cancelling action of the various migration streams involved. Table 1 presents the urban-rural syphilis rates of black men residing in a selected group of Northern and Southern states.5 The urban South had the highest rates followed in descending order by the rural South, the urban North, and the rural North. Between 1900 and 1940, the bulk of black urbanbound migration proceeded from the rural South to the urban centers of the North and South. There was also movement of blacks from the urban South to the urban

4 These rates are corrected for age, race, and residence with reasonable accuracy. However, it is worth noting that other selection factors probably exist in the sample which might create distortion. Marital status, economic status, and permanence of residence are important examples.

5 Eldridge and Thomas (1964, p. 13) formed the states into groups "primarily on the basis of contiguity, but with a view to historical similarities in demographic and economic development." They included Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia in the Northeast instead of in the South. I have followed their approach.

North. It was the net effect of these prevalence-countervailing migration streams that produced the small prevalence increase.
The changes in the geographical distribution of VD since 1941 are generally consistent with differential migration patterns. As a result of the continued movement of blacks out of the Southeastern states, some of these states have been reclassified as moderate incidence states, whereas states such as New York, New Jersey, and Delaware have changed from moderate to high incidence areas (Brown et al., p. 73). Parenthetically, no urban-rural differences in syphilis prevalence were found by the

National Health Examination Survey of 1962 when rates were adjusted for sex,age, and color (U.S. Public Health Service, 1965, p. 8).
CHILDLESSNESS
Another argument frequently used to suggest increasing prevalence of venereal disease centers around childlessness. Childlessness increased among black birth cohorts beginning in 1835 to 1844 and ending with women born 1905 to 1909. One-third of the latter group completed their reproductive years childless as compared to 10% for the earlier cohort. Farley (1970, p. 226) suggests that this trend in childlessness reflects changes in fecundity due to increased venereal disease.
Space does not permit a full discussion of childlessness here. To assign principal causation to venereal disease would require the elimination of possible alternative explanations such as changes in marital status or stability, growth in knowledge and use of contraception, and changes in "tastes" for children. However, two previously discussed issues are relevant. First, there is no reliable statistical evidence that VD increased enormously over the period. The existing data suggest a rather moderate rate of increase not sufficient to explain the increase in childlessness. Second, since venereal disease was more prevalent in the rural and urban South than in the urban North, one would expect a lower proportion of childless women in the urban North if VD was the principal cause of childlessness. However, the opposite was true. The proportion childless was highest among ever-married women in the urban North in 1910 and 1940 and lowest in the rural South. Similarly, the proportion childless was higher in the urban North than in the urban South in 1910 and about equal in

Therefore this category refers essentially to the urban North. t Of the rural black population in 1910 and 1940, fewer than 7% lived outside the South. Therefore, this category represents mostly the rural South.

In addition, childlessness in 1940 was most common among black women of higher educational attainment (Table 3).

ness, any strong cause and effect hypothesis is damaged by the abundance of indirect nonsupportive evidence.
THE GONORRHEA TREND
Historical information about gonorrhea is even more scarce than that concerning syphilis. There are no reliable statistics available between 1880 and 1936. However, it is likely that gonorrhea prevalence followed approximately the same trend as did syphilis over the period. This would be expected as syphilis and gonorrhea are quite similar. Their mode of transmission, treatment, and prevention differ only in detail. Both diseases flourish under the same combinations of demographic and socioeconomic conditions. They have an almost identical age, sex, color, and geographical

Such women would be expected to have fewer cases of VD and better treatment once infected. This is only one of a group of sodoeconomic-fertility differentials which go in a direction opposite to that expected if the VD-childlessness hypothesis was valid.
These data suggest that the trend in childlessness was not wholly fashioned by changes in fecundity due to increased venereal disease. Although VD was probably responsible for a portion of the childless-

distribution (Brown et al., 1970, pp. 8486). Because information about VD was suppressed prior to 1935, the nature and treatment of both diseases was misunderstood by most people (Brown et al., p. 1). Furthermore, a quick, inexpensive, and effective cure was not discovered for either until 1943 and again the curative was the same--penicillin. Thus, the inference is that syphilis and gonorrhea experienced generally parallel trends and differentials between 1910 and 1935 and that neither

prevalence increased dramatically. After 1935, this similarity was eroded due to the early preference accorded to the treatment and case finding of syphilis.
CONCLUSIONS
The question posed here was: Did VD actually become more prevalent between 1880 and 1935? The available evidence weighs against any great increase between 1910 and 1940. However, the question remains of whether or not there may have been a very great increase before 1910. The fact is that no one really knows how prevalent VD was at the beginning of the black fertility decline or throughout much of its course. Or in 1820, for that matter! However, there is fragmentary evidence which indicates that syphilis did not increase drastically between 1880 and 1910. Deaths from syphilis occur about thirty years after infection. Therefore, the death rates of 1915 and 1940 are rough indicators of the syphilis prevalence in 1885 and 1910, given no substantial improvement in medical care during the period (see next section). As Table 4 indicates, between 1915 and 1940

the black mortality rate due to syphilis rose from 52.5 per thousand to 61.6 per thousand. Such data suggest that syphilis was quite prevalent as early as 1885 and that this prevalence increased only about 17% by 1910.
Finally, even if VD had become enor-

mously more prevalent between 1880 and 1936, this would not prove in itself that the black fertility decline was largely due to the increased prevalence. Indeed, the third section of this paper suggests that venereal disease has a milder impact on fertility than is generally acknowledged.
WAS THE SUDDEN RISE IN FERTILITY AROUND 1936 PRECEDED BY THE EFFEC-
TIVE CONTROL OF VD IN THE BLACK. POPULATION?
According to the venereal disease-fertility hypothesis, the rise in black natality which began in 1936 is explicable by a fall in VD prevalence as the result of the discovery and application of superior treatment methods and the simultaneous creation of government VD control programs. This section will examine the quality, availability, black awareness, and timing of these developments to see if they adequately explain the reversal in the fertility trend.
TREATMENT METHODS
First, at what level was treatment for gonorrhea and syphilis in 1935? Were there any important improvements in treatment at this time that could have effected substantially more cures, thereby reducing prevalence?
In 1944, seven years after the fertility upturn, a successful two-hour penicillin treatment for gonorrhea was introduced (Garfinkle, 1947, p. 50). Before this time, however, no treatment was completely satisfactory. The application of silver compounds, irrigations, and protein injections were messy and time-consuming. Local treatment offered little relief, and the disease usually completed its cycle. The miracle drug sulfanilamide, which gained widespread use in the late 1930's in lieu of other forms of treatment, may have contributed to the complications of the dis-

ease (Brown et al., 1970, p. 83). It produced toxic reactions in approximately 50% of cases (Pelouze, 1939, p. 160); other persons were rendered asymptomatic and continued unwittingly to spread the disease (p. 169). Hyperthermia was costly, generally unavailable, and very dangerous. "Watchful waiting" was often considered the safest course (Pelouze, 1939, p. 178). One eminent VD specialist was moved to say that the only thing that kept gonorrhea from becoming a practically universal disease was its tendency to cure itself (Stokes, 1935, p. 178). In conclusion, any improvement of consequence for sufferers of gonorrhea did not come until after 1943 when penicillin offered a decisive cure.
Before penicillin, there was hardly an effective syphilis treatment either. Arsenicals and fever therapy were the most popular types of treatment during the thirties, but were often ineffective and occasionally had serious, sometimes fatal, results. Prior to penicillin, only 20 to 25fo of those patients ever receiving treatment were actually treated to the point where their infection was arrested (Brown et al., 1970, p. 15). One survey showed that failure to complete treatment was often due to the cost, to conflict between working and clinic hours, and to painful reactions to the treatment (Stokes, 1935, pp. 305-306). The long-term nature of therapy was also very important in delinquencies. A new, intensive arsenotherapy technique appeared in the years prior to and during World War II. Nevertheless, 8 to 10 weeks were still required for completed treatment (Brown et al., 1970, pp. 15-16). Rapid Treatment Centers were established throughout the nation in 1942 to treat patients on an inpatient basis. In 1944 penicillin became available only to these centers for the treatment of syphilis. It was not until 1947, however, that therapy on an outpatient basis was satisfactory (Brown et al., 1970,

p. 63). In conclusion, it is unlikely that the quality of treatment before the midforties was at a level which could be expected to substantially reduce the prevalence of syphilis or gonorrhea.
GOVERNMENT VD CONTROL PROGRAMS
Second, how soon after 1935 were the effects of government health programs felt? Of VD programs Farley says (1970, p. 235), "In summary, the period after 1935 was one in which many health agencies made efforts to control venereal disease and the success of these efforts lessened sterility and reduced problems of subfecundity among Negroes." He goes on to say that spending supported by the public health title of the Social Security Act of 1935 was greater for venereal disease than for any other single disease (Farley, 1970, p. 233). True as this may be, one investigator, Stuart Garfinkle (1947, pp. 14-17), termed its measures for VD control "sporadic and incomplete," charging that much of the money went for care of terminal patients rather than finding and treating infectious persons.
In 1937 the Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service, Thomas Parran, gave a gloomy account of the accomplishments of the Social Security Act. In 11 states, including Alabama, Florida, and New Mexico, where VD rates were very high, no funds were specifically allotted for its control. He lamented the poor facilities; only in 15 states was there one clinic per 100,000 population. Even worse, in those states where the proportion of Negroes, and therefore the prevalence of VD, was the highest, the ratio of clinics was the lowest. In 1936 such states as Florida, Mississippi, New Mexico, and South Carolina either made no reports to the Public Health Service or, indeed, had no clinics (Parran, 1937, pp. 150-152).

additional funds appropriated by Congress in 1939 for child and maternal health care, the growth through the forties of the government's VD involvement, and the increasing hospitalization of black births certainly had an impact on the health of the black population. But these programs were not instantaneously successful in reducing the prevalence of VD. Indeed, the 27% syphilis prevalence figure which is so important to the VD-sterility argument, was recorded in 1941, six years after the Social Security Act took effect, and gonorrhea prevalence did not reach its peak until 1947, twelve years later.

proper course of treatment in the event of infection. One investigator visited 8 communities and asked 2,715 young men in public places what to do for syphilis or gonorrhea. Proper advice was offered by less than 40% of the respondents in all eight communities (Pelouze, 1939, p. 449). In general, the poorer the community, the higher the probability that druggists rather than physicians treated the disease. In the poor communities roughly 90% of the druggists urged the sale of sulfanilamide for gonorrhea. Improper treatment was thought to be particularly prevalent among Negroes (Pelouze, 1939, p. 439).

BLACK AWARENESS
Regardless of treatment quality and government programs, how likely were rural and urban blacks to avail themselves of proper treatment? I t appears that during the late thirties and early forties the level of public knowledge about such matters as where to receive treatment was unequivocally poor, particularly among blacks. Several surveys conducted by the American Social Hygiene Association at this time show that the public was ignorant of the

Finally, how well are the VD prevalence and natality trends synchronized? Did VD prevalence start to fall in 1936, the same time black fertility began to rise? It does not appear so. An inspection of morbidity data reveals no substantial reduction in the incidence of venereal disease before 194S. Figure 2 shows the reported civilian primary and secondary syphilis rate,6 gonor-

rhea rate, and general fertility rate for the
black population.
It is true that the total reported syphilis
case rate began its decline earlier, around
1943. This was due to a decreased amount
of case finding, but, more importantly, to
the success of earlier case finding efforts
(Brown et al., 1970, p. 67). But, since
primary and secondary syphilis case rates
were still increasing and cases of latent
syphilis were only slightly more infrequent
at this time, it must be assumed that suc-
cesses of earlier case finding were primarily
responsible for decreases in the number of
late and late latent syphilis cases (Brown
et al., 1970, p. 154). However, effects on
fertility are negligible during these stages
of the disease (see following section) and,
therefore, lowering such case rates would
not enhance fertility.
Reported gonorrhea cases actually tripled
between 1941 and 1947 (Brown et al.,
1970, p. 155) and never declined in inci-
dence to the extent syphilis did (Wilcox,
1972, p. 1059). Only since 1952 have major
attempts been made to control gonorrhea
(Brown et al., 1970, p. 39). Several factors
in the natural history of gonorrhea make it difficult to control.7 Its short incubation
period permits it to spread rapidly; previ-
ous infections produce little immunity to
common reinfection; and 90% of females
are completely without symptoms and un-
syphilis, but also reflects the proportion of cases which are diagnosed and the proportion of the latter reported. However, experts claim that changes in syphilis case finding activity or in reporting practices could not have accounted for the large per annum decreases and increases in this series. "Therefore, reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis are interpreted as essentially paralleling the actual occurrence of disease especially when changes are sudden and large" (Brown et al., 1970, pp. 67-68).
7 These factors do not contravene the conclusion of the earlier discussion about the similarities between syphilis and gonorrhea which led to parallel trends prior to 1935. These characteristics are constants and did not influence the trend of gonorrhea from 1880 to 1935.

aware they are infectious carriers (Brown et al., 1970, p. 86). Thus, a large reservoir perpetually exists undetected even by current diagnostic and public health methods.
Furthermore, gonorrhea causes permanent sterility by irreversibly damaging the tissues of reproductive organs. The disease can be cured by chemotherapy; even in the absence of treatment, the infection will run its course and then disappear. But tissue damage and the subsequent sterility are usually irreversible. This argues against a precipitous fertility rise stemming from an abrupt prevalence decline. Fresh cohorts only gradually replace those with gonorrheal histories. Indeed, if a prevalence decrease caused black fertility to rise in 1936, one would expect to have seen a gonorrhea recession beginning about 1925 rather than in 1947 when it actually occurred.
CONCLUSIONS
The sudden rise in fertility around 1936 does not appear to have been preceded by the effective control of VD in the black population. Black fertility began to climb before substantial improvements in the quality and availability of treatment occurred, and prior to meaningful reductions in VD prevalence. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of the first section of this paper. If VD was not the major determinant of the decline of black fertility, its control was probably not the dominant factor in the subsequent upward trend from 1936 to 1957.
WHAT WAS THE QUANTITATIVE PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPACT OF VD ON BLACK FERTILITY?
The final part of this paper attempts to estimate the quantitative physiological8 im-
8VD may also indirectly affect fertility in nonphysiological ways. First, there are undoubtedly psychological consequences of the disease and subsequent pregnancy wastage. Second, some VD complications such as epididymitis are

pact of VD on black fertility from 1880 to 1936. Because the essential information is available for syphilis, it receives more satisfactory treatment than gonorrhea. Nevertheless, the role of gonorrhea is hypothetically considered.
RELATIVE IMPACT OF MALE AND FEMALE SYPHILIS ON FERTILITY
Congenital syphilitics have a tendency toward sterility in the form of syphilitic epididymitis (Stokes, 193S, p. 222). However, this is a rare complication. Of much greater significance, syphilis reduces natality in a population by increasing the probability that pregnancies will end as miscarriages or stillbirths. Men may transmit syphilis to women, but otherwise have no direct effect on infertility attributable to the disease. For this reason, a population with syphilis more prevalent among women than men would experience a stronger negative impact on its fertility than vice versa. Farley (1970, p. 223) mentions that in the twenties a Rosenwald Fund Survey found that infection rates for black women exceeded those of men in six southern counties. This leaves the reader with the impression that within the black population generally, more women than men had VD. Whether this was true or not cannot be conclusively answered. However, more recent information makes it seem unlikely. The National Health Examination Survey (1960-1962), using a sérologie test as an index of prevalence, found a higher incidence and prevalence of syphilis among men than among women regardless of race (U.S. Public Health Service, 1965, p. 5).

It is not probable that transmission patterns or susceptibility changed radically during the first six decades of this century.
MEAN AGE AND CRITICAL STAGE OF SYPHILIS INFECTION
Farley argues that syphilis among black women played an important role in their declining fertility. He cites the following statistics to support his case (1970, p. 222).
Various investigations suggest that 30 to 50 percent of the pregnancies occurring in syphilitic women who receive no care, end in fetal deaths; upwards of twenty percent of the infants born to such women die from congenital syphilis, shortly after birth. One investigator concluded "A syphilitic woman untreated, has only one chance in six of bearing a healthy live infant as compared with a normal woman's three chances in four."
However, Farley does not consider when a woman is most likely to contract syphilis and when the danger to her unborn child is greatest. It is impossible to accurately estimate the impact of syphilis on the fertility of the black population without examining these two crucial factors.
In an untreated population, syphilis prevalence increases with age. Table S

Fourth, VD may force postponement of marriage for legal or medical reasons, or encourage the substitution for marriage of consensual unions, which have demonstrated lower fertility. Finally, VD is almost certain proof of one partner's infidelity and undoubtedly increases the frequency of separation or estrangement.

races at a somewhat earlier age than males. Another study conducted between 1920 and 1931 shows the mean age and standard deviation of initial infection for the Negro females in the study to be 22.3 ± 1.4 years (Frazier and Hung-Chuing, 1948, p. 32).
Demonstration of the spirochete Treponema pallidum in smears from syphilitic lesions is the only absolute diagnosis for the infection. Such positive findings are possible only in the primary, secondary, and early congenital stages of the disease or upon infectious relapses (Brown et al., 1970, p. 27). The spirochetes enter the body at one site, the chancre of the primary stage. The spirochetes then enter the blood (spirochetemia), multiply, and are carried throughout the body. This is the secondary stage of the disease and is manifested by generalized skin lesions. Since the primary and secondary stages are over within a year and the chance of an infectious relapse is confined to early latency (within 2 years of the initial infection), spirochetemia is seldom found after this time (Brown et al., 1970, p. 22). The spirochetes are thought to now burrow themselves in various organs and late latency begins. All lesions from then on are noninfectious, evidence that spirochetemia is very rare. Since infection of the fetus requires spirochetemia, a child

conceived two or more years after its mother's initial infection should be uninfected.
Over the last forty years, medical opinion has changed with regard to what stages of syphilitic infection could be harmful to the fetus. The McCord series (1932) gives the percentage of syphilitic mothers experiencing stillbirths as 66.3% in one series and 80% in a second series (McKelvey and Turner, 1934, p. 506). In 1934 McKelvey and Turner showed that 45.9% of all births to syphilitic women in their study were stillborn. Of those born alive, 35% were healthy and 65% had clinical or later autopsy evidence of syphilitic infection. Later McKelvey and Turner asked themselves why their study showed fewer stillbirths and a higher percentage of normal children than did earlier studies. They stated, "it is conceivable also that by the use of a sensitive test patients with longstanding infections are included who would be more likely than not to give birth to normal children, for it is probable that the Wasserman titer decreases in many patients with increasing lapse of time after infection" (McKelvey and Turner, 1934, p. 506). In 1938 other investigators noted that of infants born to 431 syphilitic women, 57% born to women with a positive Wasserman were normal while 8 1 %

born to women with a negative Wasserman were normal (Whipper and Dunham, 1938, pp. 387-88) .9
By 1961 medical men were saying, "Pregnancy occurring in women with recent infection results almost invariably in miscarriage, stillbirth, or in congenital syphilis in the child. Women who became pregnant some years after infection give birth to normal children as a rule" (Blattner, 1961, p. 626). Finally, in 1967, the authors of Pathology of Infancy and Childhood (Kissane and Smith, 1967, p. 58) stated,
Congenital syphilis is acquired by the fetus of an infected mother by passage of treponema pallidum across tie placenta. Since intrauterine infection requires spirochetemia (spirochetes circulating in the blood) in the mother, the maternal infection is usually recently acquired, almost always within two years. Pregnancies beyond this period usually produce normal infants even when the mother has received no treatment.
In addition, they report that the earlier the infection in utero, the more likely is fetal death. Infection is acquired in utero any time after the eighteenth week of preg-
9 Serologic (blood serum) tests for syphilis are presumptive, not absolute, evidence of syphilis. The Wasserman test detects the presence of the antibody reagin, produced by tissues of the infected person in response to the attack of T. pallidum. The test is nonspecific, giving a very small number of false positive reactions to other infections or abnormalities such as drug addiction and pregnancy. A more specific test is the TPI or Treponema pallidum Immobilization Test, with serum from syphilitic persons being able to immobilize the T. pallidum (Parran, 1937, pp. 3132).
In the primary stage, the Wasserman or TPI may be positive or negative, depending on the time since infection, since time is necessary for the body to produce detectable amounts of antibody to infection. After successful treatment, seronegativity is usually restored within six months. During the secondary stage, seropositivity is very high, treatment resulting in a reversal to seronegativity within two years. During latency, seropositivity is low, but even with treatment is often retained for life. In general, the longer the duration of infection before treatment, the greater the probability of remaining seropositive throughout life (Brown et al., 1970, p. 28).

nancy when the mother's and child's blood come in close contact across the placenta. The more virulent the mother's infection is at this time, the more disastrous the effects on the fetus.
Given that syphilitic women will not ordinarily bear infected children later than two years after the initial infection, what is to prevent a reinfection and thus a recurrence of spirochetemia which will adversely affect the fetus? In 1952 the Public Health Service conducted a study to determine the degree of resistance to syphilitic infection demonstrated by three groups: (1) persons who had never had syphilis; (2) persons who had untreated syphilis in the latent stage; and (3) persons who had had syphilis but had received adequate treatment sometime in the course of the infection (Magnusen et al., 1956). The study was well-planned, carefully observed, and closely controlled, and its findings are considered as conclusive as any in this field (Brown et al., 1970, pp. 24-25).
The results of the study are the following. Previously uninfected persons showed no resistance to infection. Previously treated syphilitics showed a wide spectrum of reactions to the challenge of reinfection, resistance being directly related to the length of time between acquiring syphilis and receiving treatment. Thus, all persons who had been previously treated for early syphilis were reinfected, while only 38% of those treated for late latent syphilis were reinfected. Most importantly, those persons "with untreated latent syphilis showed no clinical or sérologie response to challenge and are presumed to have been resistant to reinfection" (Magnuson et al., 1956, p. 79). The level of antibody titer (Wasserman or TPI) was of primary importance here, resistance to reinfection being greatest among persons with the

16

highest titers. Among treated syphilitics, the titers (and thus resistance to reinfection) decreased as the time between infection and treatment became shorter (Magnuson et al., 1956, p. 74). Titers were highest among untreated syphilitics.
Thus, it would be expected that a woman receiving no treatment for her infection would be resistant to reinfection. However, a woman receiving adequate treatment has little or no resistance to reinfection, especially if treated in the earlier stages of the disease. If exposed to T. pallidum, reinfection and the subsequent danger to any unborn children are possible.
EFFECT OF SYPHILIS
The above findings place rigid limits on
the amount of fertility loss which can be
attributed to syphilis. Syphilis is not a
physiological fertility factor throughout the
entire childbearing period of infected
women. Its effect is roughly confined to
the two-year period of primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis.10 Consequently,
the high incidence of miscarriages and still-
births mentioned by Farley and others only
applies to a two-year period which usually
occurs in a woman's early twenties. After
this interval syphilis ordinarily has little
effect on fertility. A very crude estimate11 of the quantita-
10 Throughout much of the literature, latency has been arbitrarily divided into two stages, early latent and late latent. For example, the "International Lists of Diseases and Causes of Death" define early latent syphilis as asymptomatic syphilis of less than four years' duration. However, in the past few years, there has been a trend in the United States to define early latency as latent syphilis of less than one year's duration, for it is during this time that infection is of greatest epidemiological and medical significance (Brown et al., 1970, p. 25).
11A precise estimate of the physiological effect would require an elaborate model which would simulate the variability and complexity of the actual situation. For example, it would assign a varying probability of stillbirth or miscarriage which would be determined by the distributions

tive effect of syphilis on fertility can now be approximated. Consider a population with the following characteristics. First, little birth control is practiced and that which is is ineffective. Second, the average birth interval for women age 20-29 is 30 months. Third, the mean age of initial infection for women is about 22 years. Finally, venereal disease treatment is unavailable. Although some conceptions which occur during the infectious two-year period actually result in live births, assume that in this population all conceptions during the period terminate as miscarriages or stillbirths. Since infected women are temporarily infecund during this 24-month period (four-fifths of a birth interval), they avert four-fifths of a birth.
In 1880, the black population closely resembled the one just described. Between 1880 and 1936 the average completed family size of black women shrank from seven to three children. Approximately how much of this decline can be attributed to syphilis?
Although the first part of this paper argues against a dramatic rise in syphilis prevalence, to answer this question effectively let us assume that prevalence among black females increased drastically from zero in 1880 to 2S% in 1936.12 Under this assumption, since each infected woman in 1936 would avert four-fifths of a birth, then each black woman would avert onefifth of a birth on the average. Quantitatively then, the physiological effects of syphilis account for at most 5% of the
of women by moment of conception and moment of infection.
12Actually, the 25% figure for 1936 is probably fairly accurate. Prevalence estimates for 1936 are not available, so the corrected estimate of black male prevalence in 1941 must be used. Women generally have lower prevalence than men. Therefore, an estimated rate of 25% for black women in 1941 is probably about right. Furthermore, there is no indication that prevalence changed radically between 1935 and 1941.

fertility decline between 1880 and 1936. Because this estimate is based on the 100% pregnancy wastage supposition, and the zero per cent prevalence assumption for 1880, the actual syphilis contribution is probably somewhat lower.
EFFECT OF GONORRHEA
It is less certain how much of the fertility decline can be attributed to gonorrhea. Reliable prevalence data are virtually nonexistent, and too little is known concerning the proportion of those infected who become sterile. However, by resorting to unrealistically high prevalence and sterility assumptions, an approximate upper-limit estimate of the effect which gonorrhea exerted on black fertility can be made.
Unlike syphilis, gonorrhea is a major sterility cause in both sexes. In women, gonorrhea can cause sterility if the infection spreads to the fallopian tubes (salpingitis). The frequency of this complication and the proportion rendered sterile are unknown for the period's black women. Recent studies have found, however, that approximately 12% of gonorrhea cases are complicated by salpingitis (Rees and Annels, 1969, p. 213; Maraño, 1971, p. 101). But to be safe, let us assume that 20% of the black females experienced this complication and that sterility was the outcome in every case. Finally, assume a gonorrhea prevalence of 50%. Surprisingly, just 10% of the women become sterile in this exaggerated model, and conceivably only a minority become so before bearing children.13 If it is assumed that these women averaged two children before reproductive failure, then 10% of the black population experienced a deficit of five births, all else being the same as in 1880.

Thus, under this set of deliberately high assumptions, female gonorrhea can physiologically account for little more than 12% of the fertility decline between 1880 and 1940. The actual quantitative effect is probably somewhat lower.
Prostalitis, veseculitis, orchitis, and epididymitis are the male complications that cause sterility. The first three are rare, occurring in less than 2% of cases. Epididymitis occurs more frequently. It is estimated that during the early twentieth century epididymitis complicated about 20% of male gonorrhea cases and rendered approximately one-third of these individuals sterile (Pelouze, 1939, p. 240)." Assume that the prevalence of gonorrhea among black males was 50% in 1936 and that each man averaged two children before reproductive failure. In this model, about 3 % of black men become sterile which can account for only 4% of the fertility decline.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, it is unlikely that venereal disease was the dominant architect of the decline in black fertility from 1880 to 1936. Even if the unrealistic assumptions of a zero to 25% syphilis prevalence increase and a zero to 50% gonorrhea prevalence increase are accurate, such increases could account for only about 20% of the observed natality change. Under lower and more realistic assumptions, this estimate would become substantially lower.
DISCUSSION
Although this paper disagrees with Farley's interpretation of the importance of VD as a causative factor of the black fertility trend, it is indebted to him for framing the issue. In the last fifty years, demogra-

13 This is an additional reason to believe that gonorrhea was only a minor contributor to the childlessness recorded for one-third of the 19051909 cohort.

14 Pelouze (1939) is an early source, so this information may be dated, although this is not necessarily the case. I was unable to find a more recent source despite hours of research.

phers have been obliged to speculate on the same VD-fertility hypothesis without the benefit of relevant information. At last, Farley has performed the valuable service of putting enough substance behind the hypothesis to make it an attractive and tractable issue.
It should also be noted that this paper has challenged only the VD portion of Farley's more general "poor-health loweredfertility" hypothesis. Although VD is the most cited and probably the most important fertility-inhibiting factor in this hypothesis, changes in other health conditions certainly had some effect on natality. However, the actual impact of these other health factors lies outside the scope of this paper and these questions await further research.
This paper criticizes the principal arguments which support the hypothesis that VD was the dominant factor explaining the 1880-1950 black fertility trend. In the process, it offers a more conservative interpretation of the importance of VD in the natality history of the black population.
But if VD wasnot the major architect of black fertility, how then can the trend be explained? This is still an open question mainly because the required evidence has not yet materialized. Nevertheless, I believe that the black fertility trend was probably fashioned by essentially the same tradi-

tional factors that determined its white counterpart, although health factors undoubtedly played a more significant role in the former. Notice the remarkably close correspondence between the nonwhite and white fertility trends during this period (see Figure 1). In addition, fertility differentials within the black population were classic in their outlines before and aftei 1936. Negative relations between fertilitj and education (and/or literacy) existed Marital status, occupational, income, anc rural-urban differentials all displayed the same pattern which characterized the white population. These similarities seem too pervasive to be coincidental. It seems unlikely that two simultaneous and almost identical demographic patterns could have resulted from distinct sets of causal factors. In view of this parallelism, it is difficult to support the hypothesis that the explanation of the black fertility trend is unique or radically different from that of its white fertility counterpart between 1880 and 1950.
