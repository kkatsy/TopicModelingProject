ABSTRACT: The effect of agricultural organization on fertility is examined by a cross-sectional analysis of data from two rural Philippine communities. Largely settled after World War II, both communities began traditional subsistence farming. Over time one community has turned to commercial farming. Contrary to expectations, no substantial differences between the two communities are found in fertility levels or in the relationship between socioeconomic status and fertility. Status is negatively related to fertility in both communities, and most of its effect is through age at marriage. In the community which has developed commercial agriculture, status affects fertility after marriage, but then only slightly.

Fertility levels are lower in more developed nations than in less developed nations. Furthermore, the experience of the more developed countries has been that fertility declines with modernization. Industrialization and urbanization with their accompanying increased economic opportunities, higher levels of education, health, and security, and reorganization of the family are the major structural factors cited as influencing the negative relationship between fertility and modernization (Davis, 1967; Freedman, 1975; Heer, 1966; Hohm, 1975; Kasarda, 1971; Teitelbaum, 197S; United Nations, 19S3).
Industrialization and urbanization have therefore been proposed as the means by which less developed nations can lower their fertility levels and alleviate their great population pressures. However, time, resources, and market limitations make industrialization unlikely in the near future for most less developed countries. And aggregation into cities can occur without bringing the benefits which ac-

crued to the industrialized nations (Breese, 1969; Hawley, 1971). If industrialization and urbanization provide no feasible solution to the population problem in the near future, just what can be done? Family planning programs have been one attempt to solve the problem; but as so well argued by Davis (1967), such a response ignores the social and economic structure that influences reproductive motivation. Another possible solution is the reorganization of rural communities from traditional subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture.
In the traditional subsistence agriculture found throughout the less developed world, the family is the unit of production. Its major source of power is the labor of family members; its strength as a producing unit increases with its size (Hawley, 1950). The economic structure motivates parents to have large numbers of children. In commercial agriculture, farming becomes a business enterprise. The work of machines replaces human labor, and chil-

two crops have not produced fertility differences in other parts of the Philippines or the less developed world.
The majority of settlers in each community came from the Visaysan Islands where dry corn cultivation is the prevailing type of traditional agriculture. However, in Magsaysay, a small group (18 per cent of immigrants) originated in Hlocos Norte where wet rice cultivation predominates. To establish the traditional wet rice cultivation of their homeland, the IIlocanos had to transform their kin-based irrigation association, the zanjera, into a community coalition, since individuals migrated without their kin group and since Blocano homesteads were not contiguous. Thus, Magsaysay and Matanao did not share a crucial element in their early development. We propose, however, that this innovative force alone would not have been sufficient to produce fertility differences, had it not been successful in producing higher yields, in bringing the Visayans into the coalition, and in evolving into a community organization for commercial agriculture. The Hlocanos were not distinct from the Visayans in any other crucial respect.
We hypothesized that fertility would be lower in Magsaysay where commercial agriculture has developed than in Matanao where traditional subsistence farming has become entrenched. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the association between measures of socioeconomic status and fertility would be positive in Matanao, reflecting its traditional organization, and would be negative in Magsaysay, reflecting its modernized economic structure. But because changes in organizational form take time to work their way through a system, the fertility behavior of the Magsaysay population may reflect that of a society in the process of transition; that is, there may be no association between socioeconomic status

and fertility. We shall first compare fertility levels of the two communities and then fertility differentials within each community.
A note of caution should be inserted. These data on total number of live births do not include the fertility of women who died or who left Magsaysay and Matanao. If these excluded women systematically differ in fertility from those surveyed, our reports of community fertility will be biased. We have no way of checking this possible bias. Another problem is that of underreporting of live births which will be more likely in the cases where a child died or left home and where the woman was older. To reduce underreporting because of poor recall, interviewers obtained a list of all pregnancies by type of termination and employed probing in checking the list.
COMPARATIVE FERTILITY RATES
The 1969 crude birth rates of Magsaysay and Matanao are high, 42.6 and 41.6 per 1,000 respectively. Magsaysay has lower marital fertility than Matanao (306.8 to 320.7), but has a higher general fertility rate (227.7 to 221.0), and childwoman ratio (1,070.0 to 976.6) than Matanao. The higher general fertility rate and child-woman ratio of Magsaysay can be explained by its larger proportion married, particularly at the younger ages. These differences can be seen as well in the age-specific fertility rates (Table 1). Fertility for all women is greater in Matanao than in Magsaysay except at ages less than twenty and between ages 30 and 34. Marital fertility is greater in Matanao for all age groups but that of women between 30 and 34. The difference in allwomen and married-women fertility rates at ages less than 20 years is explained by the greater proportion not married in these ages in Matanao (see Table 2). Almost 90 per cent of women between 15-19 years

are unmarried in Matanao, while only 77 per cent in this age group are unmarried in Magsaysay.
Total fertility rates for married women in both Magsaysay and Matanao are greater than the cumulative fertility of married women who have completed their reproductive years, even greater than the cumulative fertility of women who married before the age of 20 years (see Table 3). Total fertility is generally higher than cumulative fertility because it assumes no deaths through the reproductive ages. But this difference coupled with the higher cumulative fertility of women 40-44 suggests that younger women are having a greater number of births within younger

age spans than did older women at comparable ages. If younger women maintain the 1969 age-specific rates as they pass through their reproductive years, their completed fertility will be greater than women who completed their fertility in 1969. Undoubtedly, improved health is reducing fetal loss and infant mortality, thereby increasing the number of reported live births. Also, improved health is reducing the number of maternal deaths, permitting more women to live to reproduce. Unless younger women curtail their childbearing in the later years, fertility will increase in both Magsaysay and Matanao.
Women reach their peak fertility be-

tween the ages of 25 and 29 in both communities. Though fertility declines with age thereafter, it remains relatively high in the advanced ages of the reproductive period. Peak fertility of Magsaysay and Matanao women in 1969 represents a five-year upward change from rural peak fertility found by Hawley in 1952 (Hawley, 1955); but it matches the years of peak fertility reported for all the Philippines in 1960 and 1968 (Lorimer, 1966; Flieger, 1972).
The proportion of women not married by 19 years of age was over half in both Magsaysay and Matanao among the early migrants, reflecting the single male migrant pattern prior to 1950. The proportion not married by 19 declined with later groups. In 1969, however, this proportion appeared to be increasing among women in their twenties in both communities following the recent trend of rising age at marriage apparent throughout the Philippines (Flieger, 1972).
Only 10.6 per cent of women less than 19 years of age are married in Magsaysay. At ages 20-24, 56.3 per cent in Matanao and 69.5 per cent in Magsaysay are married. In the peak childbearing years 25-29, almost 9 out of every 10 women in each community are married. The per cent ever married at all ages is greater for both

Matanao and Magsaysay than it is for the Philippines as a whole, except for Matanao women under 20 years who have the same proportion married as the nation (Smith, 1975). Although Matanao has a larger proportion not married, Magsaysay has a larger proportion not married until after the teen years.
There is a clear difference in reproductive histories between women marrying before the age of 20 years and those marrying afterwards (Table 3). By the end of the reproductive period (ages 2=50), women who married at 20 years of age or later have an average of 2.6 fewer births in Magsaysay and 1.5 fewer births in Matanao. Because of the increased proportion marrying after 19 years of age, declines can be expected in future fertility; and because the proportion is larger in Magsaysay than in Matanao, larger fertility declines can be expected in Magsaysay. Perhaps this trend to later marriage and lower fertility will cancel the high fertility expectations associated with their agespecific fertility rates.

tion, husband's occupation, husband's land tenure, and household income. We shall first explore the relationship between each individual socioeconomic measure and fertility with a control for age. This will be followed by a multivariate analysis of all socioeconomic variables on marital fertility controlling for both age and age at marriage.
Table 4 presents total live births per woman by woman's education. Educational categories are collapsed in this table for greater clarity. In both Magsaysay and Matanao a modern pattern is observed showing decreasing fertility with education when age is controlled (p < 0.001). Most of the impact of education seems to be occurring in the early reproductive years. Childbearing is postponed with more education. In these data there is no evidence of fertility's being curtailed in the later reproductive years.
Household income is measured as income of all family members from all crop sales, wages and salaries, sales of farm animals, rentals, tenant shares received, trading, sari-sari store sales, money lending with interest, pensions, money sent home by relatives, and any other incoming cash. The value of crops raised and consumed at home is not included in our mea-

sure as the reliability of that information is questionable. As with education, income categories are collapsed for clearer presentation.
Table 5 presents data on cumulative fertility and household income among respondents. When income is grouped into four categories as in this table, a modern pattern emerges among the younger women. At ages less than 25 years, there is a clear inverse association between fertility and income in both Magsaysay and Matanao; but among women older than 24 years of age in Magsaysay and women older than 35 years in Matanao, no clear pattern emerges. When household income is not grouped, the relationship between fertility and the full distribution of income is negative but nonsignificant in Magsaysay and significantly negative in Matanao (p < 0.01).
Before viewing fertility by husband's occupation (Table 6), we should note that data are thin in the professional/merchant category. Most of the age groups in this category contain fewer than ten women. Despite this shortcoming, a consistent though nonsignificant pattern of variation can be observed in Magsaysay. Total number of live births per woman is highest in the farming class and lowest in the

professional/merchant class. In Matanao the inverse pattern is not as clear since the nonfarm skilled and unskilled class at ages under 30 years has higher fertility than the farming class.
When farming families alone are observed and women are categorized by husband's farm tenure (Table 7), a negative association between fertility and socioeconomic status is found among women of both communities (p < 0.001 in Magsaysay, p < 0.01 in Matanao). Members of the highest category of farm tenure, owner/owner tenants, have the lowest fer-

tility. Because of the small number in the farm laborer category, caution should be used in any generalizations.
Contrary to expectations, both communities demonstrate a modern pattern of class differences in fertility when education and land tenure are separately used as indicators of socioeconomic status and age is controlled. Although a tendency toward an inverse association between fertility and the other two indicators of class, husband's occupation and income, is apparent in oiir data, only income in Matanao holds significance.

riage is controlled suggesting that these two socioeconomic variables operate on fertility only by delaying marriage and causing a reduction in early childbearing. In Magsaysay, on the other hand, household income and woman's education are significant (p < 0.001), though they explain only a small proportion of the variance in cumulative fertility. Woman's education in Magsaysay appears to negatively affect fertility both directly after marriage and indirectly by raising the age at marriage. However, income is left with a positive effect when the influence of age at marriage is controlled. Husband's occupation, though negative, is nonsignificant.
The picture was similar when only farm families were observed and tenure was substituted for husband's occupation in the multiple regression equation. Age and age at marriage accounted for most of the explained variance in the cumulative fertility of married women in Magsaysay (45 per cent, p < 0.001), and all of the explained variance in Matanao (46 per cent, p < 0.001). In Magsaysay, education and tenure were negatively associated with cumulative fertility (p < 0.05, p < 0.01 respectively). The greater the number of years of schooling and the tenure status, the smaller the number of children borne by each age and marriage age group. On the other hand, income was positively associated with cumulative fertility as it was in the total group of married women (p < 0.001).
Not only have the differences in agricultural organization between the two rural communities not produced any substantial differences in fertility levels, they have not produced substantial differences in the way socioeconomic variables affect fertility. In both Magsaysay and Matanao woman's education, income, and land tenure negatively affect fertility indirectly through age at marriage. However, at this

time in Magsaysay, the replacement of traditional subsistence agriculture by commercial farming shows effects only on the relationship between socioeconomic variables and fertility after marriage, and those effects are quite small.
SUMMARY
Contrary to expectations, Magsaysay and Matanao, with similar origins but divergent development, were not found to differ in their fertility. Both communities have high fertility. Direct effects of modernization such as improved health and reduced mortality, which immediately increase fertility, are being experienced by both Magsaysay and Matanao through the efforts of the national government. It is possible that these direct effects are overwhelming any indirect effects of modernization such as increased knowledge and increased cost of children which tend to reduce fertility. It is also possible that at this early stage of commercial agriculture, which is still dependent on labor-intensive cultivation and not yet producing substantial increases in income, the value of children does not change. Perhaps only at more advanced stages of commercial agriculture do mechanization and consumption cause children to be revalued. Trends to higher educational achievement and later age at marriage, coupled with negative associations between fertility and education and between fertility and age at marriage, suggest that fertility will be reduced in the future. However, such a change will require a reduction of fertility at older ages, since the data suggest the younger women are presently experiencing higher fertility than older women did in their younger years.
A modern pattern of fertility declining with socioeconomic status has appeared in both Magsaysay and Matanao. Status affects fertility indirectly through age at

marriage. Fertility is being reduced in the early reproductive years by higher status women who delay marriage. Socioeconomic differences within communities appear to be having a greater effect at this stage than do organizational differences between communities. However, small differences between Magsaysay and Matanao were found in the effect of socioeconomic status on fertility after marriage. In Matanao, fertility shows no effect from socioeconomic status once age at marriage is controlled. But in Magsaysay, where important organizational change is occurring, education and tenure status have significant, though small, negative effects

on fertility when marriage age is controlled. If modernizing influences continue to accumulate in response to innovation, we would expect the next survey to register significant decreases in fertility and increasing fertility differentials by socioeconomic status in Magsaysay.
