Beginning with the Indianapolis Study (1941) and proceeding through the National Fertility Survey, we have learned a great deal about the fertility of many different subgroups in the American population and the factors which influence their fertility performance. More recently, poverty and minority groups have been singled out for special attention. While our knowledge about the fertility of these groups is not complete, there is evidence to indicate that the amount of research on such groups is increasing (Rainwater, 1960; De Jong, 1968; Goldscheider and Uhlenberg, 1969; Sly, 1970).
Despite the increased attention given to "special groups," there continues to be one group which can neither be isolated from census data nor contacted by the "pad and pencil corp" which emerged with the advent of survey research. We refer here to the American elite. The present paper reports the results of one modest effort to investigate the fertility of this segment of the population. More specifically, three objectives have been set: (1) to compare the fertility of elites with the fertility of the American population in general; (2) to examine the fertility of elites by selected differentials; and (3) to examine the historical trend in elite fertility.

THE SAMPLE
It has been noted on numerous occasions that elite group membership is not determined by a one-dimensional scale. The most recent studies to take this position are Keller (1963, p. 4-6) and Lenski (1966, p. 78-79). The point of consensus among authors who have dealt with the topic of elites and various aspects of their behavior, however, appears to be that in demarcating this group one must consider a functional (objective) criteria as well as a prestige (subjective) criteria. In stratification theory, the former is emphasized by the functionalist (for example, see Davis and Moore, 194S) and the latter by the more social psychological approaches such as that employed by Warner and his associates (1948). Baltzell (1953a) has argued that a workable operational technique whereby this two-dimensional approach could be considered is through a crossclassification which would sample individuals whose names appear in both Who's Who in America and the Social Register of the various cities having such listings. He notes that persons whose names appear in the former are the functional leaders in our society to the extent that they are the leaders in their professions, while persons

whose names appear in the latter are the prestige leaders.
To bring our sample in line with this two-dimensional view of elites, our primary criteria for inclusion was that a person's name appear in both a Social Register and Who's Who. We began with the Social Register for each of the eleven cities having such listings (New York, Buffalo, Boston, St. Louis, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Cincinnati-Dayton), taking the first male on page 4 who was over 40, then the last male on page 8 who was over 40, and proceeded to follow this first-last criterion on every fourth page. I t was necessary throughout to cross-check age with the Who's Who listings since age was not reported in the Social Register.
The vast majority of data collected was taken from Who's Who; however, in those cases where data reports were incomplete in the Who's Who, mail questionnaires were sent out. Of the 371 men in the original sample (names appearing in both Who's Who and the Social Register), complete data files were obtained for 359 evermarried males. These men constitute the sample upon which our analysis is based.
For purposes of analysis, we have assumed that these men have completed their fertility. To some this may appear to be a rather naïve assumption, as indeed it does to the authors. The naivete of the assumption, of course, rests primarily on the facts that the male potential to impregnate does not decline at 40 and that males of age 40 are likely to have spouses younger than themselves, and thus still in childbearing ages. The assumption, however, does make it less likely that we will overstate the findings reported below and therefore tends to lend a conservative tone to our conclusions.
The variable of chief concern in our

analysis, fertility, is measured by the number of children ever born to each evermarried male. The accuracy of this figure may be questioned on the grounds that men may not include children by previous marriages; however, we originally tabulated children separately by sex of child and by the number of marriages to reduce the chances of this happening. Whenever we had reason to expect a multiple marriage, a mail questionnaire was sent to the respondent.
ELITE FERTILITY
The view most often expressed in introductory texts concerning the relationship between socioeconomic status and fertility is that "The general relationship is a negative one: the higher socioeconomic status groups have the lowest fertility" (Stockwell, 1968, p. 118). While this relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated for aggregates, some have argued that it cannot be ubiquitously accepted. Hawley (1950, p. 114-119), for instance, argues that this relationship represents a transitional phase in the general decline of birth rates and that as societies increasingly modernize there will emerge a positive relationship between socioeconomic status and fertility because of the declining economic advantage of having children and because of the effective spread of family planning. Goldberg's (1960) «examination of the Indianapolis data strengthened a positive relationship between socioeconomic status and fertility among family planners when length of urban residence was taken into account.
Other studies have established the possibility of a positive relationship existing between income and fertility within categories of socioeconomic status. Deborah Freedman (1963), for instance, has shown that for fecund planners there is a positive relationship between relative income and

husband present, by age of husband for the white urban population. Thus, by summing the number of children born to women at all ages whose husbands are over 40 and dividing by the number of women, we can obtain an estimate of the average number of children born to wives whose husbands are over 40. The resulting figure is more comparable to our estimate for elites and tends to confirm the expectations of larger families among the elite since the average based on census data is only 2.42. Unfortunately, we know nothing about the comparability of the age structure of the wives of the elites and the age of the wives in the census sample.
Some indication of what produces the mean difference in number of children born to these two groups can be gained by examining the distributions in Table 1. Almost equal proportions are found to be childless or to have one or two children. The similar proportion having two children (about 24%) in each group is particularly striking, as is the similar proportion (about 8%) having five or more children. The major differences between the two groups appear to be in the proportions having three and four children. Here we find that 8% fewer of the elites have three children, but that about 12% more have four children.
This could be interpreted to indicate that elites have less control over their fertility than the general population or that they have a preference for larger families. It is the latter of these possibilities which appears to be the most probable. When we recall the mean difference between the two groups and take note of the fact that considerably more elites have four children, it seems reasonable to conclude that there is quite likely a preference for slightly larger families among the elites. This seems more likely when we also consider that contraception is more likely to have been available to the elite group. Some may object to

this interpretation on the grounds that the 1965 National Fertility Survey indicated that women at all income levels desired to have about the same number of children. We should note, however, that our definition of elites goes beyond a mere income categorization and that some authors making extensive use of data from this source admit this possibility: "There is some speculation that the real terminal point of this transition may be a situation in which socioeconomic status and fertility are directly correlated, that is, where the number of children born will be a function of the couple's ability to afford them" (Westoff and Westoff, 1971, p. 221-222).
DIFFERENTIALS IN ELITE FERTILITY
Three factors repeatedly mentioned in studies of fertility differentials are age at marriage, education, and religion. Studies of the fertility behavior of national samples have indicated that each of these factors has an influence on completed family size. Tables 2, 3, and 4 show the relationship between each of these factors and fertility among our elite sample.
The average age at first marriage for our sample is 27.6. From this figure and the data in Table 2 we can see that the age at first marriage among our elite sample is later than the age at first marriage is generally thought to be for United States males. One-third of the men in the sample married between the ages of 26-29, and nearly 38% of the men did not enter into their first union until after the age of thirty. Despite this, we can see that age at first marriage has little effect on the outcome of fertility until the upper limit considered here. That is, on the average, the men in the sample had between 2.6 and 2.8 children unless they married after the age thirtyfour when their average fertility appears to have reduced considerably. It is also possible, however, that the males in this latter

group will complete their fertility at later ages because of their relatively late start at family formation. The similar average number of children born to the first three "age-at-first-marriage categories" may also be interpreted as further evidence of the control of this group over its fertility. However, the differences observed in this table could also result from the interaction of a complex of factors related to the mobility aspirations, starting position, education, and career patterns of the elite.
As one would expect, the majority of the men in our sample are college graduates;

however, one-fifth of the men either did not attend college or did not graduate from college. All of the men in the sample did graduate from high school. The data in Table 3 tend to suggest that those men who did not graduate from college had to reduce their fertility to maintain or obtain their position. That is, the men in both educational categories (high school grads and some college) who did not graduate from college had on the average fewer children than did the elite men on the average; and axiomatically, those menwho did graduate from college had on the average more children than did the elite in general. Moreover, those men with some college had on the average the fewest children, further suggesting that perhaps their marginal educational status required the greatest sacrifice. This latter point tends to add support to the work of Freedman (1963) mentioned earlier and is supported by the findings of Baltzell (1953b) and Tomasson (1966).
The religion variable produces the most salient difference in fertility performance among our elites; however, this difference is the reverse of what we would expect. That is, Catholics on the average had fertility which was markedly lower than that of the elites who were Protestant. Thus,

398

once again we find that when the men in our sample possess a status which is in conflict with their elite position then their fertility is on the average lower than that of the elites in general, suggesting that a reduction in fertility is part of the "price" which must be paid to obtain or maintain the elite position.
Finally, we can ask what is the magnitude of change in elite fertility over the years? To investigate this question, we have broken our sample of elite males into five-year cohorts as shown in Table 5. If

the case of those men who were 70-74 in 1963 that part of their fertility was curtailed by the Depression. However, because their average is identical to that of the men who completed their fertile period prior to
1928, it is also possible that the averages reflect a pre-Depression preference with respect to elite family size.
The next category of fertility performance includes the three cohorts which entered the fertile period in 1919, 1924, and 1929. These men had on the average about 2.4 children, and their performance was

we assume that these men have a "fertile period" of fifteen years spanning the ages from 25-40, the last column of the table shows the years during which each cohort passed through this period. The second to the last column shows the average number of children ever born to each cohort's members. These data strongly suggest that there are marked differences in the fertility of the various five-year cohorts.
Three distinct categories of fertility performance emerge on inspection of these data. First, those men who completed their fertility prior to 1928 had on the average 2.8 children. It seems quite possible that in

obviously affected by the Depression years, The last cohort in this category (that entering the fertile period in 1929) had somewhat higher fertility than did the two cohorts which entered the fertile period in 1919 and 1924, but their completed fertility is lower than that of each cohort entering the fertile period after 1934. That fertility was not reduced by more than what it apparently was is probably indicative of a postponement of births or the result of working with five-year cohorts,
The last three cohorts considered form the third category of fertility performance. Whereas each of the above two categories

Vol. 19, No. 4

can be characterized by their homogeneity of performance, this last category is distinguished by the fact that each successive cohort to complete the fertile period had on the average more children than the preceding cohort. By 1963 when the latest cohort had completed its fertility, the men in this group had on the average 3.66 children. This represents a 26% increase over the fertility of the first cohort in this category (that entering the fertile period in 1934), and a 39% increase over the fertility of the last cohort in the second category. This increase in fertility is probably indicative of a preference for an increased family size among the elite population. This appears a valid assumption when we consider that more efficient methods of contraception were probably available to later cohorts and that they were probably subject to more liberal norms with respect to their employment. The relatively small sample size, particularly in the last cohort to complete its fertile period, strongly suggests that despite the statistical significance found caution should be observed in accepting this finding. It should be noted, however, that even if the last cohorts are combined the average number of children born is over three, and that the latest cohorts to complete what we have defined as the fertile period are actually the cohorts most likely to have additional children, indicating perhaps even a conservative bias in the estimates.

fare, 1960, p. 78-104). That is, if we look at the comparable cohorts in the general population, we find the highest average number of children born to women in the cohorts born before 1888 (roughly 3.31 for cohorts comparable to those in our sample), a steady decline in completed fertility for those cohorts passing through their fertility period during the Depression (reaching a low of about 2.30), and a slight up-turn in the post-Depression category (reaching a high of about 2.3S for the last cohort).
If, as is often suggested, the elite group sets the pattern of life styles which are eventually adopted by the general population, we can expect an increase in the average size of family among the American population (Barber and Label, 1952; Eggan, 1963). However, it is obvious that family size is only one aspect of life style and that most American families cannot afford to emulate the elite family size depicted in these data and also strive for the more materialistic "prizes" possessed by this group. Fallers (1954) has noted, however, that the passing down of consumption patterns has to some extent been made possible through the increased purchasing power of middle and lower groups. Thus, if the purchasing power of the middle and lower groups in society continues to rise, it seems possible that members of these groups, even though they have increased control over their fertility, may attempt to emulate the fertility of the elite.

Thus, the pattern of completed elite cohort fertility is "J shaped," beginning at a relatively high level (2.8), reaching a low point (about 2.4), and then beginning a steady climb and reaching a new high point of about 3.6 for the last cohort examined. It is interesting to note that this pattern is just the opposite of the one for cohorts in the general population (for females) (U. S. Department of Health Education and Wel-

Moreover, the data presented here, contrary to that of Riser and Schacter (1949) for females, indicate that the elite population is having no trouble reproducing itself. These data strongly suggest that since the Depression elite fertility has steadily increased. Given that this group has probably had the most knowledge about contraception and the greatest access to it, we are led to believe that this increased fertility is
