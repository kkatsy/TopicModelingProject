The sequence of events which begins with gametic union and ends with the birth of a living child is sometimes interrupted by fetal death. Knowledge of the frequency with which this interruption occurs strengthens our understanding of the reproductive process. Fetal deaths occur principally during the earlier stages of pregnancy, and a major proportion apparently represents elimination of abnormal fetuses (WHO, 1970). Estimates of the loss in man range from 5% to 60% (Figure 1). Many investigators attribute this range of values to the biases associated with the type of data collected (c.f., Tietze, 1953; Warburton, 1961; James, 1970), while less attention is directed to the impact of the form of the analysis itself.
Recognition that pregnancies at different stages of gestation are exposed to the risk of fetal death for unequal lengths of time has led to the application of the life table to generate better fetal death estimates. Life tables convert observations made at different times to a set of agespecific probabilities. As such, they seern ideally suited to estimate probabilities of fetal death in man.
The earliest study of fetal death to use a life table model derived an estimate of 23.1% fetal death based upon observed

sex ratios for later fetal deaths and theoretic sex ratios for the first three gestation months (Pfaundler, 1936). Subsequent life table studies began to incorporate pregnancies observed during the first trimester, the result of improved diagnostic procedures. Some studies ascertained pregnancies through health insurance plans (Shapiro, Jones, and Densen, 1962; Shapiro and Abramowicz, 1969; Shapiro, Levine, and Abramowicz, 1970; Taylor, 1964, 1970); some used clinically diagnosed pregnancies (Mellin, 1962; Pettersson, 1968; Awan, 1969); and others incorporated a variety of detection procedures (French and Bierman, 1962; Erhardt, 1962, 1963).
Results from selected studies (Table 1) show that life table estimates of fetal death need not be uniform. This variability may be due to differences in the study designs, true differences among the populations, or to other factors, since the samples also differ in a number of social and biological parameters (e.g., social class, income, parental ages, degree of consanguinity, number of prior pregnancies and fetal deaths, ethnicity, education). Although the relative contribution to fetal death of most of these variables is uncertain, some (e.g., age and parity) have effects which seem obvious. Therefore, while these pre-

vious studies maynotrepresent the actual age-specific risks of fetal death, it appears that they do confirm that the early gestation periods have thegreatest fetal loss.
In the study of fetal death, life tables reflect the interaction between two probability distributions: the chance of pregnancy termination and the chance of pregnancy detection. The actual observation of pregnancy is a function of both distributions. The former represents the chance that a fetal death (or a live birth) will occur at a particular gestation age. The latter reflects problems of pregnancy detection at specific gestation times and actually has two components: (1) the chance of detecting a pregnancy before its termination; and (2) the chance that the pregnancy termination itself signifies, for the first time to an outside observer, that the pregnancy exists.

The existence of these two probability distributions could have introduced another source of variability in the above studies in that different life table models and diverse computational procedures were employed.
The object of this study is: (1) to derive fetal death estimates as a function of different life table methods, using a common set of data; (2) to evaluate the appropriateness of thelife table models themselves; and (3) to determine whether inclusion or exclusion of pregnancies ascertained just at termination critically changes estimates of fetal mortality.

interval (the time between two successive
gestation ages), there will be jt fetal deaths, bt live births and lt + 1 pregnancies which survive the interval and do not terminate:

The probability of a fetal death in the t-th gestation period is qt and that of a live birth is rt. Thus, the probability of not terminating in the t-th interval, that is, the chance of the pregnancy successfully reaching the t + 1 gestation age, is

pt = l -- qt -- rt.

(2)

It will be shown later, when the appropri-

ate computing formulas are developed, that

estimates of qt and rt are dependent upon the particular life table model selected.

The probability that a fetal death will

occur sometime between one gestation age

(t) and some later gestation age (?) is called the cumulative probability1 and is

denoted as Qt,r, where

Qt.v= qt + Ptqt+i+ Ptpt+iqt+2

+ ...+ptpt+i...pr-iqe.

(3)

Thus, the chance of a fetal death occurring

sometime between the start of pregnancy

and the third gestation month is

Qo,3 = <7o -f- Poll + PoPrfvi
+ PoPip2qs- (4)
Similar expressions can be derived for live births if the probability of fetal death (q) is replaced by the probability of live birth (r) in equations (3) and (4) above.
In the following section, four life table models will be described and defined in the context of their application to the study of fetal death.

TYPES OF LIFE TABLE MODELS IN FETAL DEATH STUDIES
Life table models useful in fetal death studies depend upon the nature of the ob-

servations themselves. When each pregnancy is ascertained at the same gestation age and each is followed until termination, a cohort or generation life table can be computed. In this case, the duration of observation is a random variable. Here, a set of women with positive pregnancy tests, all in the third gestation month, could be followed until pregnancy ends. Since the cohort life table represents the actual pregnancy experience observed in a population, observation begins at gestation age t with some initial population of size lt and the number of live births, bt, and the fetal deaths, ft, are observed in each subsequent gestation period (c.f., French and Bierman, 1962). Observation continues until all lt pregnancies have been terminated and the live table probabilities are calculated directly from the observations:

qt = ft/h,

(5)

U = bt/lt,

(6)

and

Pt = It+t/h-

(7)

Pregnancies ascertained at different gestation ages (a cross-section) where each pregnancy is again followed until termination, form the basis of a fusion life table, the most commonly used model in the study of fetal death (Erhardt, 1962, 1963; French and Bierman, 1962; Taylor, 1964, 1970; Pettersson, 1968; Awan, 1969; Shapiro et al., 1970). The designation "fusion" is applied since this model combines the cohorts from month two, month three, and so on. As a composite of several cohort tables, the gestation age-specific probabilities are actually the weighted averages of the respective cohort probabilities represented in that time period.
All pregnancies used in the fusion life table are included from their ascertainment until termination. Newly ascertained pregnancies (which themselves constitute a

cohort) are entered into the life table when they are first observed. Most intervals, therefore, contain pregnancies from several different cohorts which are fused to form a single life table entry. Each successive interval can be considered a new cohort starting its initial exposure period for purposes of computation. To accomodate the partial exposure of the N newly ascertained pregnancies requires an additional term in the denominator of equations (5) and (6):

rt = h + aNNt

Thus,

(10)

The average time a pregnancy is observed in its first interval of inclusion, a^, can either be estimated from the data directly or can be set equal to some predetermined value. When as equals 0.05, the distribution of the observations is considered to be uniform in the interval, which is the assumption used by French and Bierman (1962). When aN equals 1.0, as was the case for Pettersson (1968), all pregnancies are considered to enter observation at the start of the interval.2
Validity of a fusion life table requires that the assumption of equal age-specific termination probabilities, for each of the contributing cohorts, be verified. This was the case for French and Bierman (1962). Should the contributing cohorts possess

different age-specific probabilities, estimates from the fusion life table may be unreliable.
If the pregnancies in a cross-section are observed for a fixed time period, a period life table would be indicated. Each pregnancy would be assigned to a unique period in the life table using one of several procedures. A prospective study would follow a sample of pregnancies from some population for one month, first having fixed the gestation age of the pregnancy. For example, if all pregnancies in an area were studied only during the month of April, the gestation ages of the initial observations could range from just past fertilization to ten or more lunar months. Other types of cross-sections would be the gestation month during which prenatal care begins or when the pregnancy is first diagnosed. A prospective study of retrospective data (e.g., vital records, hospital records, interview date) could use the gestation age at which a pregnancy test was obtained or prenatal care was started.
Regardless of the assignment procedure, two criteria must be satisfied: (1) no pregnancy can be used in the life table for more than one gestation period; (2) observation must be made upon a cross-section of gestation ages.
The current study enters pregnancies into the period life table based on either of two criteria. If the time of the first prenatal visit is known, the pregnancy is entered at the start of the following gestation month. This ensures an observation period of no longer than one month and avoids additional problems associated with partial exposure to termination during the previous month when the first visit occurred (since the visit could have occurred at the end of the gestation month). When pregnancies without prenatal care are included in the analysis, they are entered in their termination month, which assumes

In summary, four types of life tables can be used to estimate fetal death probabilities. Each of the four models will now be used to analyze a set of pregnancy records collected in New York City.
THE DATA
The live birth and fetal death certificates filed in New York City in both 1963 and 1967 were selected for analysis because New York City requires the reporting of all pregnancy terminations, no matter what their gestation age. The data were provided by the New York City Department of Health, which routinely collects and files the fetal death and live birth certificates. The numbers of live births and fetal deaths reported in 1963 and 1967 are tabulated in Tables 3 and 4. The totals are presented by gestation month of termination and gestation month of the first prenatal visit, including those without prenatal visits and those whose prenatal visits are not stated.
It is recognized that reporting of spontaneous fetal death is far from complete (Erhardt, 1952) and that induced abortions may, at times, be included posing as spontaneous terminations. This issue will be discussed in greater detail later. However, an advantage is that large numbers of early fetal deaths are available for analysis together with the later fetal deaths and live births. The total number of reported pregnancies (165,000 live births and 21,000 fetal deaths in 1963 and 142,000 live births and 18,000 fetal deaths in 1967) is sufficiently large to minimize sampling variance, which leaves bias as the principal source of error.
Each certificate of pregnancy termination includes the length of pregnancy in gestation weeks (computed from the date of the last menstrual period to delivery), the gestation month of the first prenatal visit, the type of hospital in which the

pregnancy terminated and the attendant at that termination, as well as demographic information including maternal age, paternal age, racial group, and the number of previous pregnancies, abortions, live-born, and living children.
RESULTS
A total of sixteen cohort tables (eight for both 1963 and 1967) were computed, each composed of those pregnancies with prenatal care reportedly indicated in a particular gestation month (Table 5). Although the results indicate that up to 14% of the pregnancies end in fetal death, three elements indicate some caution in their interpretation. First, Erhardt (1969; unpublished memo) argues that fetal death reporting in New York City has fallen off in recent years. This appears to be confirmed (assuming no decline in the actual propensity for fetal death from 1963 to 1967) in that the 1963 estimates are almost double those for 1967. Second, a large number of women had no apparent prenatal care before the pregnancy termination, the majority of which were fetal deaths. These 27,000 pregnancies in each year represent 14.8% of the 1963 reports and 17.1% of the 1967 reports. Since it is impossible to determine when prenatal care would have started, their exclusion from the cohort analysis suggests these estimates are low. Lastly, the heterogeneity of the gestation age-specific probabilities within both 1963 and 1967 might point to sampling variability, especially since the 1963 estimates generally exceed the corresponding estimates for 1967. However, the excess could also indicate an actual decrease in the chance of fetal death.
Omission of 15% to 20% of the recorded pregnancies based on absent or unknown prenatal care weakened the cohort analysis. A similar effect is observed in the pseudo-cohort analysis. When preg-

* Cumulative probabilities are presented for eight cohorts in both 1963 and 1967. Each cohort consists of women whose first prenatal visit occurred in that particular gestation month. These figures represent the probability of fetal death from the current gestation month to the end of pregnancy.

nancies without prenatal care are excluded, the cumulative probability of fetal death is less than 4% (Table 6); but, when all terminations are included, the probability exceeds 11%, a three-fold increase.
The fusion life table results (Table 6) also confirm that omission of pregnancies without prenatal care will result in diminished probability estimates. In this case, the estimated probability of fetal death is less than 10% when these pregnancies are excluded and exceeds 40% when these pregnancies are included, a four-fold increase. Therefore, like the pseudo-cohort life table, the fusion life table responds to how pregnancies are judged for inclusion in the analysis.
The period life table analysis encompasses gestation months two to nine since

only eight prenatal care cohorts can be denned. When the analysis omits pregnancies without prenatal care, the estimated probability of fetal death is slightly less than 10% (Table 6). And when these terminations are included into the period life table, the estimate increases to approximately 75%. The seven-fold increase in the period life table estimate is greater than the corresponding increase to the pseudo-cohort and fusion estimates,
Three of the four models, the pseudocohort, the fusion, and the period life tables, are demonstrably sensitive to the inclusion of pregnancies without prenatal care. In Figure 2, the cumulative probabilities for gestation months two to six
are shown for the pseudo-cohort, the fusion, and the period life tables. In each

case, probability estimates with these pregnancies included, representing 15% to 20% of all reported pregnancies, are markedly higher than estimates in which they are excluded. This difference is the result of a few thousand early terminations, all fetal deaths, which when added to the small numbers of women who seek prenatal care early, dramatically increase the overall estimate. Late terminations without prenatal care are generally live births. However, their impact is small since most pregnancies are already ascertained.
Shapiro et al. (1970) reported similar effects. Using the fusion life table, the fetal death rate was 21.8% when fetal deaths in the same gestation week as ascertainment were excluded and 34.0% when these were included.
Cohort life tables, by definition, exclude any pregnancy which is without prenatal care. For this reason, the cohort estimates within are not likely to be the best approximation of the true fetal death rate. Substantial variation is seen among the estimates based on all terminations. The monthly probabilities converge as gestation advances (Figure 3), with the greatest variation in month two. A similar pattern is observed when the cumulative probabilities are plotted (Figure 2).
Three issues require further discussion. First, why do the different models generate divergent estimates? That is, why does the period life table estimate 75% fetal death, the fusion life table 24%-40% fetal death and the pseudo-cohort life table 11% fetal death? Second, why should inclusion or exclusion of some pregnancies drastically change a given set of estimates? And third, what is the significance of the unexpectedly high estimate of 75% fetal death generated by the period life table? These first two issues are considered in the next section, the role of bias in life table estimates.

THE ROLE OF BIAS I N LIFE
TABLE ESTIMATES
That estimates of fetal death probabilities depend, in part, upon the model is indicated by the diverse results generated by the cohort, pseudo-cohort, fusion and period life tables. An additional aspect or component of such variability resides within the data itself. Several factors, singly or collectively, could bias the probability estimates and include: (1) the difficulties associated with pregnancy ascertainment; (2) random and systematic errors in the filed certificates; (3) small sample sizes in some months relative to samples in other months; (4) induced abortions reported as spontaneous terminations; (5) nonreported fetal deaths; (6) women with a higher risk of fetal death starting their prenatal care earlier, thus being unrepresentative of the population risk at the gestation age; (7) pregnancies which terminate in the absence of known prenatal care (almost 20%); and (8) the criteria used to include or exclude a pregnancy from analysis.
PREGNANCY ASCERTAINMENT
A major obstacle in the study of fetal death is the difficulty in detecting pregnancies in early gestation (Mall and Meyer, 1921; Tietze, 1953). Precise estimation of fetal death probabilities ideally requires a large cohort of pregnancies to be determined at conception, followed prospectively until termination, and the products of conception studied when a fetal death occurs to facilitate recognition of etiologic factors.
Immunological slide tests, which test urine for the presence of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) as an indicator of pregnancy, are the most common sensitive methods of early pregnancy diagnosis.4

But even these tests produce reliable results only after some fourteen days past the missed menstrual period (MMP) which is about forty-two days past the LMP (Hobson, 1966; Davajan and Mishell, 1967). The MMP is usually considered the first indication of pregnancy. That is, a woman must first suspect she's pregnant before presenting herself for a pregnancy test. Recognition of the MMP depends upon the woman's concept of what constitutes a "normal" cycle. First, there is sufficient variation in human menstrual cycle length, even within women, to allow for some unnoticed delay (Treloar et al., 1967; Chiazze et al., 1968). Many pregnancies would, therefore, be undiagnosed in the first two months (dated from the LMP) and embryonic death could occur without the mother even knowing the pregnancy existed. Second, a woman's,interpretation of the MMP as a possible pregnancy as opposed to a delayed period might also depend upon her prior pregnancy experience. For example, Shapiro et al. (1970) charted the gestation age when pregnancy was first medically known, for classes based on a woman's prior pregnancy experience, and found that women with no prior pregnancies were seen earliest and women with one or more fetal deaths registered latest. Intermediate between these two groups were those women who experienced only live births.
Some of the difficulties associated with early pregnancy detection are illustrated by Erhardt's study in New York City (1962, 1963) and by the Kauai pregnancy study (Bierman et al., 196S; French and Bierman, 1962). Erhardt used several different primary reporting sources in New York and found that 28.5% to 40.0% of the fetal deaths reported to him were ab-

sent from the vital records. French et al. used seven detection procedures in their study on Kauai, Hawaii. Still, one-third of the fetal deaths were discovered after the termination had already occurred, and over half of all the pregnancies remained undetected when the first trimester ended. Despite intensive efforts, neither study fully achieved its stated objective of early pregnancy detection. Collectively, half of the pregnancies in these two studies had successfully completed three months of development before ascertainment (Figure 4) (almost a third still remained to be ascertained after an additional month) and are, therefore, the survivors of the particular periods alleged to have the highest risk of fetal death.
Some pregnancies are reported to have started prenatal care prior to the missed period. This first cohort, which contains the only data in the current study pertaining to the first gestation period, is used in life table computations with the proviso that the sample may not be representative. Since pregnancies cannot be readily verified before the second week past the missed period, this group could be an amorphous mixture of: (1) women whose later visit confirmed the pregnancy but who count an earlier visit as the start of prenatal care; (2) erroneous dating, where the woman perhaps confuses the time from the LMP with the time from the MMP; (3) errors in coding or card punching; (4) women who actually thought themselves to be pregnant following a coital act; and (S) women who recognize physiologic and behavioral changes associated with minute hormonal changes at the start of pregnancy. It is interesting that vital records are not alone in having prenatal care reported in the first month. Taylor (1970) found his sample contained "a few women who, by the records, came for interview before missing one period."

To compensate for problems in early pregnancy detection, some studies have used pregnancy histories and include early terminations even if the woman was the only person cognizant of the fetal death.

Even this type of retrospective study lacks precise control for gestation time since women likely differ in their awareness, acceptance, and recollection of pregnancy. Accurate recollection of past events

may be difficult to elicit from the patient. Simons (1939), for example, studied the pregnancy histories of 1,000 women admitted to a hospital for an abortion. He estimated that 37.0% of their prior pregnancies ended in a fetal death although the proportion of fetal deaths which were recalled decreased as the number of prior confinements (live born) increased. However, this trend could be attributed to memory loss (Freedman et al., 1966; Potter et al., 1965) and may not be indicative of an actual decrease.
RANDOM AND SYSTEMATIC ERRORS
The advantages of the retrospective study are often offset by faulty data. Discrepancies in the filed certificates are not uncommon and, in some instances, data are altogether missing. Errors could either be random, where the chance of error is independent of some attributes of the data, or systematic, where the chance of error depends, in part, upon some other component of the record. For both cases, we would like to know what their frequency is and how they effect probability estimates derived in a life table.
In vital records, the magnitude of reporting errors is largely unknown. However, two hypothetical examples illustrate how random or systematic errors could affect probability estimates.
In the first example, suppose random coding errors occur 5% of the time, where the error consists of replacing a number with either the one immediately above or below, with equal chance. Let the actual (as opposed to reported) numbers of ascertained pregnancies be 4,000 in gestation month two, 25,000 in month three, and 40,000 in month four. A 5% error implies 200, 1,250, and 2,000 pregnancies are miscoded. The tally for month two would have 425 additional pregnancies (1,250/2 added from month three and 200 deducted from month two), an increase of

over 10%. In contrast, month three loses 150 pregnancies (2,000/2 -f- 200/2 -- 1,250), a drop of less than 1%.
It is easily shown that if the proportions of fetal deaths in each month are the same, the probability estimates would be unaffected. But the chance of fetal death tends to decrease the longer ascertainment is delayed. If the group with the small numbers has a higher probability, a disproportionately larger number of live births is misclassified from the larger adjacent group and the probability estimate would then be too low. Conversly, a lower probability in the small sample group would cause the estimate to be higher than it ought to be since a random sample from the adjacent, large sample group contains an excess of fetal deaths.
In the second example, suppose the chance of incorrectly recording the month of the first prenatal visit increases as the time between the termination date and that visit increases.6 Erroneous reports would thus more likely occur in certificates reporting late terminations, most of which are live births, than in those reporting early terminations. That is, a live birth with prenatal care starting in the second month might have this time reported as the third or fourth month. A 5% systematic error implies 5% of the month-three prenatal care group were actual visits in month two. Let the reported numbers in each month (as opposed to the actual numbers) be 4,000, 25,000 and 40,000 pregnancies. A 5% systematic error misclassifies 1,250 live births from month three and 2,000 live births from month four. The actual number in the prenatal care groups are then 5,250 in month
5 The basis for the assertion is that many hospitals rely on the woman's recollection, after parturition, of the month of the first visit while in others, the physician is required to use her personal records. Procedures for completing vital certificates also vary according to the source of the report.

two, 25,750 in month three and 38,000 in month four. The probability estimate for month two would be biased upward since 1,250 pregnancies are missing in the denominator while the estimate for month four would be slightly lower than expected, the result of 2,000 additional pregnancies in the denominator.
While the probability of reporting the wrong date is unknown, it might be expected to be similar to the chance of incorrectly recording the gestation age of the termination. The length of pregnancy is usually dated from the LMP, a date which has traditionally been regarded as imprecise and unreliable. Hammes and Treloar (1970) examined this concept by contrasting distributions of the gestation time for term pregnancies, the data from several vital statistics sources, with similar distributions derived from the Minnesota Menstrual Study. They conclude, "One can be 95% confident that the bounds for recollection for LMP dates is within plus and minus two weeks" (p. 1504). Gestation time estimates for early fetal deaths, however, are likely to be less accurate. Iffy (1965) reports that "in the majority of those gestations which eventually end as early spontaneous abortion and ectopic pregnancy, fertilization is followed by bleeding at the time of the expected period" (p. 495). Many fetal deaths in the second gestation month (dated from the true LMP) would be unnoticed, a systematic error which would make the probability estimates too low.
UNEQUAL SAMPLE SIZES
The effect of error, either random or systematic, is greater when there are unequal sample sizes, the smaller ones being more sensitive. Random errors are essentially samples from other codes and an unequal chance of selecting a live birth (or a fetal death) biases the estimates.

Systematic errors are functions of some other attribute of the phenomenon measured and could involve either live births or fetal deaths for different reasons.
INDUCED ABORTIONS REPORTED AS SPONTANEOUS ABORTIONS
It is difficult to evaluate the bias introduced by reporting induced abortions as spontaneous abortions. Probability estimates of spontaneous fetal death would be inflated to the extent that induced abortions were included in the records (which would have been criminal prior to July, 1970). While false reporting may have been common, the overall pattern of reporting in New York City from 1960 to 1970 suggests it would have been minimal (Table 7). The numbers of reported live births and fetal deaths were about the same until 1964, whereupon both decline. This decline is sharpest for the early fetal deaths, as reflected in the drop in the ratio of early fetal death per 1,000 live births, and counters the expectation of constant ratio if reporting patterns did not change. The decreased ratio observed suggests nonreporting of fetal death may have gradually increased.
In 1970, with one-half year of legalized abortion experience, the reported number of spontaneous fetal deaths jumped 32.2%, in the face of almost 44,000 induced abortions reported (for a halfyear). More important, the ratio of early fetal deaths to 1,000 live births, which decreased steadily after 1965 (from 103.1 to 82.1), jumped to a high of 117.2%. A sharp increase in the numbers and proportions of early fetal death, in competition with 44,000 induced abortions suggests that few induced abortions were posing as spontaneous terminations in the vital records in 1963 or 1967.6
6 Unfortunately, vital records collected since 1970 have not separated spontaneous and induced fetal deaths. In addition, induced abortion is now

NONREPORTING OF FETAL DEATHS
Although New York City requires a certificate to be filed for every termination, including fetal deaths in the first twenty weeks of gestation (Erhardt, 1952; Baumgartner and Erhardt, 1953), Erhardt (1962, 1963) found that up to a third of the known fetal deaths were not reported. As a prospective study originating from the New York City Department of Health, the effect of study participation may itself have increased the likelihood that some fetal deaths were reported which might not have been otherwise. It is therefore likely that the 30% estimate represents a minimum figure. That reporting of early fetal deaths seems to have improved since the start of the New York abortion law (Table 7) is itself interesting.
EARLY PRENATAL CARE AS A POSSIBLE INDICATOR OF HIGHER RISKS OF FETAL DEATH
Are pregnancies ascertained in early gestation more often destined to terminate in an early fetal death? Women with problems in early pregnancy, such as bleeding, are thought to seek prenatal care more quickly than the general population. It is further assumed that such women are therefore more likely to experience a fetal death. Hudson and Rucker (1945) report 94 spontaneous and 12 induced abortions among 1,000 consecutive pregnancies. In addition, 66 threatened abortions (some vaginal bleeding present with or without cramps sometime during the pregnancy) ended in live births, though the problems generally occurred during the first trimester. At least 42.0% of the women in this sample experiencing problems in early pregnancy bore live children.
a sanctioned competitor for pregnancy termination with spontaneous fetal death and live birth. Doubtless, some pregnancies which were spontaneous terminations before are now artificially terminated. No reasonable predictions are yet available of how many pregnancies should be included in this category.

In a later study, Rucker (1952) found that only 14% of 141 cases of threatened abortion during the first half of pregnancy actually ended in a fetal death and Robinson (1967) reported that 12.3% of late fetal deaths were preceded by bleeding in early pregnancy. Collectively, these studies indicate that problems during early pregnancy are not certain indicators of impending fetal death, though the risks may be elevated.
Should there exist a set of high risk pregnancies which seek prenatal care earlier than usual, the estimates would be biased in the early periods. However, there is no conclusive demonstration that a separate high risk population of pregnancies exists. Warburton (1961) and Warburton and Fraser (1964) found no support for the concept of the habitual aborter; the recurrence risks after abortion were the same. Alternatively, James (1961, 1963) asserted that women can be separated into one of two groups based on a different propensity to abort. Unfortunately, the confounding effects of other variables (e.g., maternal age, parity, socioeconomic status) are not understood sufficiently to decide in favor of one hypothesis or the other. If, for example, the true probability of a fetal death within the second gestation month is 0.50, then, independent of the reasons prenatal care is sought, ten women seeking prenatal care in the second month will produce five fetal deaths. The clinical observation, moreover, remains invariant; half of the women seeking early prenatal care are having difficulties and are likely to abort. Thus, the clinical observation, while valid, does not itself prove that early fetal deaths are drawn from a separate high risk population.
The characteristics of those who seek early prenatal care in the current study suggest no apparent difference in maternal

age or the number of prior pregnancies for those women who seek early prenatal care or those without prenatal care (Table 8). To determine if those with early prenatal care (in this sample) are likely to have an increased chance of fetal death, the distributions of the weekly age-specific

probabilities derived from the cohort life table analysis were statistically evaluated. It was found that the average private patient in New York City starts prenatal care three months earlier than the average clinic patient but that seeking prenatal care earlier has no apparent effect on the subsequent likelihood of fetal death, especially after the thirtieth week.7 Similarly, neither the type of care sought nor the type of hospital in which the woman receives her care seems to alter the chance of fetal death (Abramson, 1971).
PREGNANCIES WITHOUT PRENATAL CARE
The association between the likelihood of ascertaining pregnancies and the risk of
7 The liberalized abortion law in New York, however, has induced women to present themselves earlier in the pregnancy than they did prior to the law. The average gestation time for the first visit should have dropped precipitously, as indicated by more women presenting themselves, for a specific level of live births, than previously (see Pacter and Nelson, 1971).

fetal death partially determines the pattern of pregnancy ascertainment. First, it is easier to ascertain pregnancies later in gestation. Second, the chance of fetal death is highest in early gestation. How these interact is illustrated as follows. Assume 50% fetal mortality within the second gestation month and only a 1% chance of ascertaining a pregnancy in that month. Then almost half (49%) of the pregnancies are never ascertained. The absence of these unknown terminations sharply reduces the pool of potentially observable pregnancies in subsequent gestation months. Therefore, ascertaining viable pregnancies later in gestation is not equivalent to describing early fetal deaths. Patently, pregnancies in the former group have zero chance of fetal death prior to their ascertainment.
As a corollary of the above, if prenatal care is the sole basis of entry into a study, many fetal deaths will either occur before care could be initiated or just at the time care is sought. For example, in the Child Health and Development Studies in California, "all cases delivering within 2 days of their first appearance have been excluded . . . to restrict the study to women who appear for prenatal care as a matter of natural inclination" (Taylor, 1970, p. 308). His study used 772 fetal deaths but excluded 237 pregnancies using the above criteria. Most of these can be presumed to be fetal deaths. In addition, many of 731 women determined to be not pregnant could have been early fetal deaths.
Between 15% and 20% of the pregnancy terminations were reported in the vital records as having no known prenatal care and, by definition, are considered to be ascertained at the time of termination. Pregnancies ascertained without prenatal care were generally fetal deaths prior to the twentieth gestation week and live births after the thirtieth week.

Excluding the no-prenatal care group from life table analysis results in lower overall estimates of the probability of fetal death (age-specific probabilities are lower in the early gestation ages and higher in later gestation, live births then being omitted).
Since the likelihood of ascertainment is positively associated with the gestation age, pregnancies without prenatal care may or may not represent a special population, which includes illegal abortions requiring hospitalization or pregnancy terminations where the woman was not questioned about prenatal care.
CRITERIA TO INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE PREGNANCIES
The effect of selection criteria on life table estimates can be illustrated using the data from the Kauai study (French and Bierman, 1962). Ninety (30% of the total reported fetal deaths and sixteen live births were rejected on the grounds they were ascertained after the pregnancy termination. Additional fetal deaths were rejected when indicative of problems in the reporting system, e.g., when the fact of pregnancy itself was reported as doubtful.

Two new sets of estimates for live birth and fetal death probabilities will be derived here, one which excludes and one which includes these 106 pregnancies (Tables 9 and 10), illustrating changes In life table estimates as a function of how pregnancies are selected for inclusion in an analysis. The period life table estimates excluding the 106 pregnancies are approximately equal to French and Bierman's estimates based on a fusion model. Four of the nine period measures exceed the corresponding fusion measures. Three intervals in the period life table have no fetal deaths entered and the corresponding non-zero fusion probabilities are considered an estimate of the expected period probabilities.
If the ascertainment time for the 106 pregnancies is defined as their gestation age at termination and each is included in the analysis, the period life table estimates in months three to five are 1.6 to ·1.9 times higher than previously. Linear regression on the ratios of the two sets of period estimates provides an estimate of the second month probability. Now the cumulative risk is approximately 40% in contrast to the original estimate of 24%.

Ninety fetal deaths, which represent only 2.8% of all the pregnancies in the study, are responsible for a 70% increase in the cumulative probability with the larger part of that increase coming in the first trimester. This example confirms the finding in the current study that life tables are sensitive to how pregnancies are scored for inclusion in the analysis.
SUMMARY OF THE EFFECT OF BIAS
While imperfect ascertainment in several guises leads to biased life table estimates, the net effect of all forms of bias is presently indeterminable. Disproportionate sampling can result when erroneous criteria are used to include or exclude a pregnancy from analysis. Under-reporting or faulty classification would cause the age-specific fetal death probabilities to be underestimated while an increased chance of high risk pregnancies entering the sample early would cause the monthly probabilities to be overestimated.
The net effect of bias upon the agespecific probability estimates ultimately depends upon the degree to which the ratio of unknown terminations to not-yetascertained successful pregnancies {Ut/ Nt +1) deviates from the ratio of observed terminations to observed survivors

the age-specific probabilities are unbiased. Disproportionate sampling from either
the terminations or the successful pregnancies would disrupt the above equality and result in biased probability estimates. For example, when more fetal deaths are reported than expected, including induced abortions masquerading as spontaneous abortions, the numerator in the life table is excessive and the probability estimate is biased upward. If successful pregnancies are underreported at a specific gestation age, the corresponding denominator decreases and the probability estimate is again biased upward. In most cases, the bias in the probability estimates can be expressed in terms which are independent of the actual sample size used to generate the estimates (Abramson, 1971).
DISCUSSION
The four life table analyses performed on the vital records from New York City

398

demonstrate a functional relationship between the analytic model and the resulting fetal death estimates. In addition, the diversification of fetal death estimates, including those from previous studies, suggests that the question of the extent of fetal death is not yet resolved. The life table format for analysis was selected because it seemed to provide both the greatest flexibility and greatest utilization of the information about pregnancy. Recognition that more than one type of life table can be used to analyze pregnancy data indicated the necessity first to define each model and then to derive estimates using a single source of data.
Evaluation of fetal death estimates is, to a large extent, based on the specific characteristics associated with the model selected. Each type of life table possesses positive and negative attributes which limit the type of inferences which can be made. Cohort life tables summarize the actual experience of some initial group and provide a basis for comparison among defined subgroups. However, there is no provision to include pregnancies which cannot be assigned to a specific cohort (for example, pregnancies without prenatal care cannot be used in cohorts formed on the basis of when prenatal care began).
In addition, most cohorts start their experience later in gestation than one would desire. Only one-third of the pregnancies used in this study could be used for first trimester cohorts in either 1963 or 1967. Given that fetal death risks fall rapidly as gestation advances and that pregnancy detection simultaneously becomes easier, determining a sufficiently large cohort close to the start of pregnancy presents obvious problems. Pseudo-cohorts include all pregnancies in the analysis, regardless of when or how they were first observed. Since pregnancies are not really at risk to termination (in the life table) prior to their

ascertainment, the pseudo-cohort underestimates age-specific probabilities. The 11 % fetal death estimate, therefore, might be considered a minimum.
Fusion life tables are also capable of utilizing every pregnancy. If prenatal care before termination is universal, then it remains only to show that each cohort's risks are approximately the same. While the prenatal care cohorts within have approximately the same age-specific risks in both 1963 and 1967 (Table 5), almost 20<fo of the pregnancies have no reported prenatal care. Most of these are fetal deaths. When these pregnancies are included, the mortality estimates approach 40%, which exceeds the findings of Erhardt (1962, 1963) and French and Bierman (1962).
Finally, the period life table estimates for both 1963 and 1967 were approximately 75%. Although this model had the advantage of using a cross-section of information, it also is affected, in varying degrees, by biases in the data, especially in the earlier gestation periods.
Unfortunately, the magnitude of most of these biases is indeterminable at present. The explanation of the difference between the period life table estimates and the fusion life table estimates is to a large extent attributed to the length of time pregnancies are carried in each life table. Table 11 presents the numbers of pregnancies used in the period and fusion life tables. The numbers for the denominator differ for the two models while the numerators are essentially the same. Differences in the denominators are explainable in that the fusion life table continues pregnancies into successive gestation ages. In addition, pregnancies observed later in gestation have an increased chance of ending in a live birth.
The differences between the two models are most striking when the distributions of

all fetal deaths are examined (Table 12, Figure 5). Here, the fusion results more closely resemble the pseudo-cohort results than they do the period results. Based on the fusion (and pseudo-cohort) model, the largest number of fetal deaths occurs during the third gestation month while the period life table suggests that almost threefourths of the fetal deaths occur in the second month. Furthermore, the pseudocohort and fusion models indicate a substantial proportion (over 40%) of the deaths occur after the first trimester in contrast to approximately 10% based on the period model. Some previous life table studies have indicated the third month has the highest risk (Shapiro et al., 1962; Erhardt, 1962; Mellin, 1962) while others have estimated that the second month has the greatest loss (French and Bierman, 1962; Taylor, 1964, 1970).

The unexpected finding that fetal mortality may be as high as 75% has ramifications in several areas. An immediate implication is that the extent of pregnancy itself (more precisely, the extent of fertilization and implantation) would be trebled. Under 25% mortality, 1.3 preg-
nancies are required per live birth while

if mortality approached 75%, 4.0 pregnancies are required. To express these figures in terms of the numbers of fetal deaths, 75% fetal mortality would result in ten-fold more fetal deaths than would 25% mortality (3.0 versus 0.3).

fetal deaths are associated with chromosomal abnormalities, and that the frequency or proportion of these abnormalities increases in younger embryos (Carr [1971] has reviewed this area). In addition, specific teratogenic agents have been identified, such as rubella and thalidomide, whose mode and time of action have been defined.
High fetal mortality may therefore indicate the extent of deformity associated with the reproductive or developmental process. Furthermore, the indication that almost 90% of the loss occurs during the first trimester suggests that many embryos already possess a major defect which may be of genetic, chromosomal, or environmental origin. Determination of the early effects of teratogenic agents may be difficult, partially the result of an already significant chance of death resulting from other factors.
Separating high fetal mortality from low conceptability would be difficult since early fetal death more closely resembles inconceptability than it does late fetal death. Therefore, demographic estimates would not be strongly affected by high fetal mortality. The upper estimate of 75% is theoretically possible, at least when considering the average birth intervals observed in several noncontracepting populations (Abramson, 1973).
The diagnosis of infertility in patients might now be separable into two components: (1) those where fertilization is absent; (2) those where fertilization and implantation occurs but where the pregnancy does not survive. Assignment to either of these classes could be made based on the results of early pregnancy testing.
Finally, although no satisfactory estimates are available for heterogeneous or mixed populations, the life table model is the appropriate choice to assess the risk of fetal death in defined, homogeneous populations. Not every woman has an

equal chance of fetal death (James, 1963). Age, parity, nutritional status, and other parameters including specific genes, likely represent specific effects which determine a woman's risk. For example, Shapiro et al. (1970) and Erhardt (1963) found the risks to differ when their populations were subdivided based on maternal age or the number of live births. For other populations, for example, those which may be characterized by genetic factors such as schizophrenia, Huntington's Chorea, RH incompatibility, or diabetes, a specific genotype may alter the chance of fetal death, either increasing or decreasing it. Application of uniform analytic procedures tailored to the specific experimental situations would facilitate precise estimates and comparisons among such populations.
SUMMARY Four life table models, the cohort, the pseudo-cohort, the fusion, and the period life tables, have been described with respect to their use as estimators of the extent of fetal death in man. Evaluation of these models was based upon the vital records from New York City, collected in 1963 and 1967, which contain 165,000 live births and 21,000 fetal deaths and 142,000 live births and 18,000 fetal deaths respectively. From 15% to 20% of the pregnancy termination reported in the vital records were without prenatal care. Each life table model was tested in two ways: (1) using only pregnancies with prenatal care and (2) using all reported pregnancies. Estimates using the first condition range from 2% to 13% fetal death (from the start of the missed menstrual period). When pregnancies without prenatal care were included in each life table, the new estimates were three to twenty times higher (11% to 75%).
