Fertility trends in England and Wales fall into three distinct periods: (1) the long period of declining fertility prior to World War I I ; (2) the postwar baby boom and the sharp rise in fertility during 1956-- 64; and (3) the fall in fertility since 1964. During the period 1956-64, births in England and Wales increased on the average by some 3 per cent per annum reaching a peak figure of 876,000 in 1964, over 200,000 more births than in 1955. By contrast, in the period since 1964 annual births fell by an average of 2 per cent each year to 1970, remained about the same in 1971, and then showed sharp annual declines of around 7 per cent in 1972-73 and 5 per cent in 1974 (Farid, 1974a; Pearce, 1975).
One of the computerized systems recently developed at the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys to investigate demographic aspects of fertility in England and Wales is designed to generate fertility measures from vital registration data relating to the childbearing histories of marriage cohorts. Called PARMOD, this system has three main programs. The first two deal with fertility measures from the mother's point of view, the difference between them being that one relates to all married women and the other to fertile married women

only. The third program analyzes fertility data from the children's perspective.
This paper summarizes the results of the application of the second program to England and Wales fertility data for marriage cohorts for every calendar year since 1951. PARMOD-2 generated for each of these marriages cohorts estimates of the frequencies of families with children, cumulative fertility rates for fertile women, and parity distributions of fertile women. The tables were constructed by single years of marriage duration, for all marriage ages under 45 years combined, and for quinquennial age-at-marriage groups up to age 40.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The source of basic data for this study is the series of tables on the family-size frequency distributions for the cohorts of women who first married in each year since 1951 in England and Wales (Farid, 19746). For any given marriage cohort, the tables show the family-size distribution per thousand women, married only once, by duration of marriage, for all marriage ages under 45 years combined, and five-year age-at-marriage groups up to age 40. This distribution for any given cohort is shown as proportions of the total number of

women at successive marriage durations and is defined in six categories: no children, one child, two children, and so on, to five or more children.
The family-size frequency distributions were derived from estimates of true cohort birth-order probabilities which, by definition, take into consideration the effects of widowhood and divorce. However, the family-size distributions and the measures derived from them are essentially cumu-

lated measures based on the assumption of a closed population. These measures, therefore, are gross measures, i.e., they represent the fertility progressions of a group of women who first married in a given year, regardless of subsequent widowhood or divorce (Farid, 1974c).

with children for selected marriage cohorts in England and Wales, by age at first marriage, at selected marriage durations. For any given marriage cohort, the frequency of families with children is defined as the ratio of the number of fertile marriages, i.e., marriages with at least one child, and the number of all marriages, as of a particular marriage duration.
The frequency of families with children rises sharply during the first four years of marriage, but the speed of the rise slackens as the frequency approaches an upper asymptote at a decreasing rate. Taking, for example, all women married under 45 years of age in 1951, the frequency of families with children climbs from 29 per cent at the first anniversary of marriage to 50 per cent at the second, 62 per cent at the third, and 74 per cent at the fifth. The frequency only increases to 85 per cent and 87 per cent at ten- and fifteen-year durations of marriage, respectively.
The statistics in Table 1 indicate consistently that age at first marriage is still a strong factor in the eventual frequency of families with children for women marrying under 20 years of age or above 30, though much less so with respect to fertility in the early years of married life. Thus, the frequency of families with children increases as duration of marriage lengthens, but the magnitude of the increase tends to become smaller as age at first marriage increases. Further, the women who marry at ages under 20, at 25-29, and at 30-34 years are more likely to become mothers in the first two years of married life than are the women who marry at ages 20-24 years. But only about half of the women who marry at ages 35-39 become mothers.
However, there are moderate differences in the eventual frequency of families with children for women marrying at 20-24 and 25-29 years of age. Thus, at 15 years'

duration of marriage, 89 per cent of the women married at ages 25-29 in 1956 were mothers, a proportion that is very close to the 90.8 per cent for those married at ages 20-24 and in contrast with the proportion for women married at ages 30-34 which is rather lower at 77 per cent. This finding suggests that postponement of marriage from ages 20-24 to ages 25-29 has less effect on the eventual frequency of families with children than does postponement either from ages 16-19 to 20-24 or from ages 25-29 to 30-34.
Considering now changes over time in the frequency of families with children, it may be seen from Table 1 that for almost all age-at-marriage groups there was a rise in the frequency of fertile women among the marriage cohorts of the 195O's and the early 1960's. Thus, about 89.4 per cent of all women married under 45 years of age in 1961 were mothers at 10 years' duration of marriage. This percentage compares with corresponding figures of 88 per cent and 84.5 per cent for the 1956 and 1951 marriage cohorts, respectively.
However, the rise in the frequency of families with children varied with the ageat-marriage groups. For the cohorts of 1951 to 1961 at 10 years' duration, there was a relative rise of about 6.2 per cent for the 20-24 age-at-marriage group, 5.3 per cent for the 25-29 group, 5.2 per cent for the 30-34 group, and 11.4 per cent for the 35-39 group. The exception to the general trend is the group of women marrying under 20 years of age, which shows an irregular trend in the level of the frequency of families with children. There was, however, a continuous increase in the frequency of families with children, as measured at the first wedding anniversary, for the under-20 age-at-marriage group--from about 43 per cent for the 1951 cohort to a peak of 50 per cent for the 1966 cohort. A

large part of this increase was due to an upward trend in the incidence of premarital conceptions (Prioux-Marchal, 1974).
Another point of interest is that the start of family build-up followed more rapidly after marriage in the cohorts of women married between the early 1950's and the mid-1960's than in others. For example, about 69.2 per cent of the women married under 45 years of age in 1961 became

mothers after three years of marriage. This percentage compares with corresponding figures of 6S.S per cent and 61.8 per cent for the 1956 and the 1951 cohorts, respectively. Thus, the absolute excess of the frequency of families with children for the 1961 cohort over that for the 1951 cohort at 3 years' duration was 7.4 per cent, whereas this excess amounted to only 4.9 per cent at 10years' duration.

suggests that only about one-third of the change in the frequency of families with children between the 1951 and 1961 cohorts, as measured at 3 years' duration, was the effect of a forward shift in the timing pattern of family build-up, whereas the remaining two-thirds of this change could be attributed ta a rise in the level of minimum reproductivity.
However, the frequency of families with children has been declining with each succeeding marriage cohort beginning with marriages contracted in 1965. In fact, the cohorts of women married in the late 1960's and the early 197O's are showing a strong tendency toward later start of family build-up. As may be seen from Table 1, the frequency of families with children for women married at 20-24 years of age at 3 years' duration of marriage decreased from a peak of about 66 per cent for the 1961 cohort to only 48.5 per cent for the 1971 cohort. The decline in the frequency of families with children, as measured at shorter durations, was even steeper, reflecting the slower pace of childbearing which has characterized the fertility of the cohorts of women married since the early 1960's.
FERTILITY OF FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN
The rise in the frequency of families with children and the forward shift in the timing of first births among the marriage cohorts of the 1950's and the early 1960's was accompanied by a rise in the fertility of women of these cohorts. This fact may be seen in Table 2 which sets out the mean family sizes of fertile women for selected marriage cohorts in England and Wales. The underlying pattern is a rise in the mean family size of fertile women married during the period 1951-61. There are, however, signs that fertile women married since the mid-1960's are moving toward lower completed fertility.

Table 2 also shows that the family sizes of fertile women of the individual age-atmarriage groups decline with increasing age at marriage, although there is a tendency for the fertility of fertile marriages to become less influenced by age at first marriage as the more recent cohorts are approached.
Although the increase in the level of fertility was an important factor in the higher family sizes of fertile women achieved at the shorter durations of marriage, for women married before the mid1960's additional changes in the tempo of fertility also contributed to these rises. An important characteristic of the fertility of these cohorts was the tendency for childbearing to start earlier in marriage and to be concentrated into a shorter period (Glass, 1968).
The effect of changing the temporal pattern of family build-up on the effective period of childbearing may be seen by calculating the proportion of completed fertility of fertile marriages achieved by the end of each specific segment of married life. Estimates of these proportions are given in Table 3 in which the expected mean family size of fertile marriages at 20 years' duration has been taken as the base of the calculations.
As may be seen, childbearing of the cohorts of women married during the period 1951-61 seems to have been very heavily concentrated in the first ten years of marriage. Thus, more than half of the completed fertility of fertile marriages of the 1951 cohort was achieved by 3 years' duration, about 63 per cent by 5 years' duration, and about 86 per cent by 10 years' duration. A detailed examination of data relating to the childbearing experience of the 1951 cohort (not given here) showed that about 98 per cent of all first births, 92 per cent of second births, and 80 per cent of third births occurred in the first ten years

of marriage, and that first, second, and third births constituted about 88 per cent of all children born to that cohort by 20 years' duration.
This finding suggests that for women who have been married for about ten years only a very little addition to family size can be expected. I t seems, therefore, that the proportions of completed fertility of fertile marriages achieved by the end of each specific segment of married life identified in Table 3 will prove to be much higher for the cohorts of women married during the period 1961-66 than those shown for earlier cohorts.
PARITY DISTRIBUTIONS OF FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN
The rise in the fertility of fertile marriages among the cohorts of women married in the 1950's and the early 1960's resulted

from a shift from one- to two- or threechild families. This shift may be seen in Table 4 which shows theparity distribution of families with children for selected marriage cohorts in England and Wales.
Looking first at the pattern of the parity distribution of fertile marriages, and taking all women married under 45 years of age in 1951 (Figure 1), it can be seen that the proportion of mothers with one child declines quickly for the first three years of marriage, then flattens out at about 40 per cent before falling slowly to about 32 per cent and 27 per cent at 10 and 15 years' durations of marriage, respectively. The proportion of mothers with two children is negligible before the first three years of marriage and then rises steadily to 38per cent by 6 years' duration with little change up to 9 years' duration. Thereafter, the

proportion of two-parity women starts slowly to decline, and it levels off at about 36 per cent at IS years' duration. The proportion of mothers with three children rises slowly but steadily during the first ten years of marriage and levels off at about 20 per cent at 15 years' duration. The proportions of mothers with four and with five

children rise slowly as far as the tenth year of marriage; the proportion with four children rises from 7 per cent at 10 years' duration to about 10 per cent at 20 years' duration, while the proportion with five or more children rises from 4 per cent at 10 years' duration to 10 per cent at 20 years' duration of marriage.

Considering the differences in the parity distribution of families with children according to age at first marriage, it may be seen from Table 4 that the proportion of mothers with one child tends to rise with increasing age at marriage, while the proportion of mothers with two children tends to rise as age at marriage increases from 16-19 years to 20-24 years and to decline for women marrying at older ages. But the proportion of mothers with three or any higher number of children declines as age at marriage increases, reflecting the inverse relationship between age at marriage and number of children achieved. However, the modal parity for mothers who were married under 30 years of age was two, whereas it was one to two for mothers married at 3034 years of age and one for those married at 35-39.
Looking at changes over time in the parity distribution of families with children and considering first the cohorts of women married before the mid-1960's, we see a decline in the proportion of mothers with one child and significant increases in the proportions of mothers with two or three children. Thus, at 3 years' duration, the proportion of mothers with two children among women married under 45 years of age increased from 21 per cent for the 1951 cohort to 25 per cent for the 1956 cohort, and to about 30 per cent for the 1961 cohort. At 10 years' duration, the proportion of mothers with two or three children increased from about 57 per cent for the 1951 cohort to about 68 per cent for the 1961 cohort. These increases at both shorter and longer marriage durations bring in sharper focus the quicker pace of childbearing and the rise in the level of fertility of these cohorts.
As already mentioned, the fertility of the cohorts of women married since the early 1960's has been characterized by a tendency for childbearing to start later in

marriage. This later start would have the effect of increasing the proportion of mothers with one child as measured at short marriage durations, even if the eventual parity distribution were to remain unchanged. As is clear in Table 4, the proportion of mothers with one child at 3 years' duration among the women who married under 30 years of age in 1966 and 1971 is higher than the corresponding proportion for those married in 1961. An examination of the detailed parity distributions for the cohorts of the mid-1960's and later (not given here) showed a declining trend in the proportion of mothers with two or more children, reflecting a tendency toward a postponement of second and third births.
DISCUSSION
The upward and downward movements in the components of fertility since the early 1950's seem to have been the effect of. two interrelated forces--a "period force" in the form of simultaneous across-allcohorts movements up and down, and a "cohort force" which affects mainly the pattern of duration-specific fertility as a result of changing childbearing patterns (compare with Bogue, 1969).
Thus, the sudden sharp rise in fertility in 1956 was the effect of a period force which affected most cohorts at childbearing ages regardless of the duration of their marriages or the number of children previously born to them, although obviously not all women were affected to the same extent. Gradually after 1956, the cohort force began to operate, affecting the two components of the level of fertility--the proportion of married women becoming mothers and the average number of births per mother--as well as the two dimensions of the temporal pattern of fertility, the early-late dimension and the rapid-slow dimension. As already mentioned, the marriage cohorts of the 195O's and the early 1960's have been

characterized by increases in the frequency of families with children and in the family size of fertile women, which resulted from increases in the proportions of mothers with two or three children. Childbearing of these cohorts also tended to start earlier in marriage and was more rapid than adjacent cohorts. These factors, of course, compressed the effective childbearing period for these cohorts.
In 1965, the period force began moving in the opposite direction with an across-allcohorts decline in fertility. This change led to a revival of the cohort component for women married since the mid-1960's in the form of a sharp decline in the proportion of married women becoming mothers in the first few years of married life, a decline in the family size of fertile marriages, and larger intervals between successive births.
However, inasmuch as the frequency of families with children in a marriage cohort represents the minimum contribution of the cohort to the replacement of the population, it may be said that a larger proportion of the women married in the 1950's and the early 1960's contributed to replacement. Therefore, if the contribution to replacement on the part of women married since the mid-1960's were to remain at the same level shown by the earlier cohorts covered, there would have to be an upward shift in the parity distribution of fertile marriages to make up for those who have no progeny.
Nonetheless, the changes in the frequency of families with children and in the parity distribution of fertile women suggest that rapid childbearing tends to be associated with a higher proportion of completed fertility achieved in the early years of married life and short intervals between succes-

sive births. Thus, if a group of women have their first births earlier than another, they also have their second and third births earlier. Further, the experience of the marriage cohorts of the 195O's and the early 1960's shows that the cohorts which have high-parity progression ratios at the early years of marriage tend to have relatively high completed family size (Farid, 1974Ô), although this fact does not necessarily imply that earlier childbearing means higher completed fertility (Campbell, 1974).
This pattern suggests that the decreases in the frequency of families with children and in the family size of fertile women which have been shown by the marriage cohorts of the mid-1960's and later could be attributed in part to a delay in the start of family build-up and larger intervals between the births to fertile marriages. Moreover, if the tempo and level of fertility for the cohorts of women married since the mid-1960's would work in such a way as to reinforce each other, the recent drop in fertility may well prove to be the effect of not only a slower pace of childbearing, but also decreases in both the eventual frequency of families with children and the family size of fertile marriages. Estimates of current birth-order probabilities suggest that the probability of having a third child would be the decisive factor determining the amount of change in the level of fertility for the cohorts of women married since the mid-1960's.
