Information on Current Biomédical Research

Advance information on more than 31,000 current biomédical research projects is being made available for the first time in dual-media format by the Science Information Exchange of the Smithsonian Institution and Walker-Carrollton Associates of New York and Washington.
As explained by SIE Director, Dr. Monroe E. Freeman, "There are numerous publications and services which report, abstract, and index research results after they have been described in the scientific literature, but Biomédical Research in Progress, 1970is the first and only comprehensive, computer-based information system which reports on biomédical research projects while they are still underway." In effect, it hopes to fill theprepublication data gap in the biomédical research literature.

Biomédical Research in Progress, 1970 is offered in dual-media format, with 31, 000 full text project summaries on 16mm microfilm plus three computer generated indexes in full-size book form. Each project appears in the Subject Index under an average of eight separate hierarchical index terms, with each entry listing the other descriptors used in indexing the project. This is an important feature because of the growing number of interdisciplinary research projects. Other alphabetical indexes include arrangements by receiving contractors and by the names of some 50,000 active investigators.
Purchasers of the 1970edition also receive special prices on SIE's new reference service whereby telephone inquiries to SIE specialists activate specific computer searches of the complete data base.
