PTC Tasting in Two Social Groups

The purpose of this brief note is to add support to the view that cultural factors, such as racial and social discrimination, can affect the genetic composition of human groups by selective membership criteria.
A sample of University of California introductory physical anthropology students was tested some time ago on a volunteer basis for their ability to taste PTC (phenylthiocarbamide) by the 5% paper-impregnation technique. Students in these large introductory classes are from nearly every de-

partment, and the sample can be viewed as effectively random for this student population. All geographical and many local races are represented on campus and in these courses, although the majority in both instances are Caucasian (white). At the same time the above sample was obtained, members of a Greek-letter social fraternity and a sorority were tested by the same method. This group is largely white American.
The results of the two sets of tests are shown in Table 1. What is obvious by simple inspection is that the two samples (random and fraternity) are different in their fre-

quency of non-taster/taster phenotype ratios. A chi-square test shows that the difference is statistically significant (xl = 4.88; P is between 0.05 and 0.01). There is little difference between the male fraternity nontaster frequency (38.7%) and that of the female sorority (37.2%), so the difference in Table 1 cannot be attributed solely to sex influence on the PTC polymorphism.
The fraternity sample is significantly different from that of the random sample largely because of defacto and/or overt racial discrimination, which at the time these data were collected was a major campus issue. The PTC nontaster phenotype frequency of the fraternity group is more like that of Europeans (c. 25 to 45%) and American whites (c. 30 to 35%) than like that of American Negroes (9 to 23%), African Negroes (c. 6%), Mongoloids (7 to 10%), or American Indians (<3%) according to Montagu (1960, p. 222). Further, these PTC data suggest that the genetic effects of social selection may be more pervasive than commonly supposed, making the evaluation of natural selection on human variation all the more difficult.
