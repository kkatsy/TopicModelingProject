ABSTRACT:From data on census tract groupings from Corpus Christi, Texas, for 1979-83, this study shows that, unlike the inverse infant-mortality-socioeconomic-status association observed for Anglos, no such association exists for the Spanish surname population. This finding is discussed in terms of recent research suggesting that the Spanish surname population of the Southwest has lower infant death rates than expected from its generally lower socioeconomic status.

Studies of infant mortality providing breakouts in the data by socioeconomic status (SES) or ethnicity are fairly commonplace, but examinations of neonatal, postneonatal, and total infant mortality by SES and by ethnicity are less common. Although early studies suggested that the inverse relationship between SES and infant mortality might have weakened almost to the point that it became nonexistent (Stockwell, 1962; Willie, 1959), more recent research found that the inverse association remains strong (Brooks, 1975; Adamchak and Stockwell, 1978; Markides and Barnes, 1977; Stockwell and Adamchak, 1978; Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977; Markides and McFarland, 1982; Adamchak and Flint, 1983;Stockwell et al., 1978).
Recent investigations of infant mortality in the Southwest have shown that Spanish surname infant death rates are lower than might be expected from the relatively low socioeconomic standing of the Spanish surname population (see, for example, Geeetal., 1976; Bradshaw

and Fonner, 1978; Markides and Hazuda, 1980; Hedderson and Daudistel, 1982), a phenomenon that appears to be confined to the neonatal component of the infant mortality rate. Even though it has been suggested that underregistration of neonatal deaths, particularly in the Texas-Mexico border region, might account for the lower Spanish surname rates (Teller and Clyburn, 1974); Powell-Griner and Streck, 1982), some studies have concluded that the low rates are real and may result from a variety of factors including protective cultural factors (Gee et al., 1976) and a migration selectivity effect (Markides and Hazuda, 1980).
If the Spanish surname population of the Southwest has lower infant death rates than expected from its low SES standing, it can be hypothesized that the inverse association between infant mortality and SES observed in the general population will be weaker among the Spanish surname population. Thus, whether because of cultural or other factors, lower SES should not translate into

markedly lower infant death rates than observed among higher SES Spanish surname groups. We examine the relationship between SES and infant mortality overall and separately within the Anglo and Spanish surname populations of Corpus Christi, Texas, an attractive setting for such study because of an even split in the city's ethnic composition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This investigation utilizes data from the thirty-six Nueces County census tracts wholly contained inside the city of Corpus Christi. The local health department provided their most recent data on infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality as well as access to individual death certificates. Working back and forth between these sources, we obtained data on infant deaths within each tract updating those reported by the Texas Department of Health. Subjects were limited to Anglos (non-Spanish surname whites) and those whites with at least one Spanish surname parent. Blacks were excluded because they comprised less than 5 per cent of the city's population. We analyzed a fiveyear cohort in order to increase the stability of the death rates (Kleinman, 1976), and we selected the most recent such cohort for which complete data were available, 1979-1983.
Information from the 1980 U.S. census was utilized to divide the thirty-six census tracts into three SES groups. We chose three appropriate census variables (the percentage of people twentyfive-years-old or greater who are high school graduates, the percentage of families living below the poverty level, and the percentage of people sixteen-

years-old or greater who are employed in managerial or professional occupations) to represent the three dimensions of SES: education, income, and occupational status. After the poverty variable was inverted, the three variables were subjected to factor analysis and each one loaded at around 0.90 on a single factor generated by oblique rotation. Pearson zero-order correlations were calculated with the following results: for education-income, r = 0.861; for education-occupation, /- = 0.863; and, for income-occupation, r=0.733. The thirty-six census tracts were ranked on each variable using the formula [(Xv LV)/(HV-LV)] X 100, where Xv equals each tract's value on each SES variable, Lv equals the lowest such value among all tracts, and Hv equals the highest such value among all tracts. The three values (range from 0 to 100) were then averaged, producing a composite SES score for each tract. The census tracts were then broken into three SES groups-- low (0 to 33.3), medium (33.4 to 66.6), and high (66.7 to 100)--resulting in 11 low SES tracts, 11 medium SES tracts, and 14 high SES tracts. Infant death rates were conventionally calculated for each SES group of tracts separately for Anglos and Spanish surname persons and overall.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The most immediately striking aspect of thefindingsis the significant (p<0.05) inverse gradient in Anglos between SES and both the total infant mortality rate (IMR) and the neonatal mortality rate (NMR), a gradient which is nonexistent in the Spanish surname population as well as overall. In addition, Anglos and
