ABSTRACT: This paper presents data on the age at natural menopause and the prevalence of operative menopause in mothers of multiple births and in a matched control group of mothersof singleton children only. The ageat natural menopause wassignificantly earlier among mothersof multiple births than among mothers of singletons. The prevalence of operative menopause was slightly higher among mothers of multiple births. Mothers of DZ unlike-sexed twins hadsignificantly higher rates of operative menopause than did women in the comparison group.

The menopause as a subject for scientific study over the past three decades has been summarized recently by McKinlay and McKinlay (1973) in their annotated review of selected studies of the menopause. They comment that with the development of instruments for describing populations, such as census data and surveys, there has been growing interest in describing the health and fertility of populations, that is, with acquiring data which are basic to any further study of the menopause. Three main categories of reports are discussed in this review: (a) the general report of clinical observation of experience, usually presented with no data, or with data from vague or unevaluated sources; (b) the survey, generally of a nonclinical population, aimed primarily at providing descriptive data on the age at menopause and on symptoms possibly related to menopause; and (c)the clinical trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of proposed treatments of "menopausal" symptoms. In this paper I shall present data most closely related to Category (b).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The population surveyed was a group of mothers of twins and a comparison or matched control group of mothers of singleton children only. The data are from a self-administered questionnaire sent to women recruited through the National Organization of Mothers of Twins Clubs, Inc., an organization one of whose major purposes is to participate in research on twinning. The organization consists of about ten thousand mothers of twins and other multiple births who are members of some two hundred and fifty local clubs throughout the United States, from Hawaii and Alaska to Massachusetts, the clubs ranging in size from ten to over a hundred members. The study was designed as an epidemiological study of the menstrual and reproductive characteristics of mothers who have borne twins in comparison with women who have had singleton children only.
Questionnaires seeking information on menstrual and reproductive history were mailed to members whose names were

provided by participating local clubs. The questionnaire was designed to investigate the relationship between multiple births and hormonal activity as reflected in menstrual, reproductive, and obstetrical characteristics. A matched control group, with matches selected by the women themselves, was an essential feature of the study design, because the usefulness of the data and the inferences drawn depended on comparisons with women who had not borne twins.

The procedure for selecting a match was described in the following way: "The 'match' is to be another mother, friend or neighbor (not a close relative), approximately the same age and with the same number of children as yourself, but with no twins in her own or her immediate family." The choice of a match who is a friend or neighbor is related to the concept of comparability on subtle personality traits or "mode of life" and possibly on general background, including such things as race, social class, ethnicity, and religion. The procedure, which was found to be effective, is described fully in an earlier publication (Detre and Wyshak, 1971).
In this paper I report on the responses of 4,752 mothers of twins or other multiple births and 4,086 matches who responded to the questionnaire and whose responses related to menopause.l Most of the women were white (over 99 per cent) and middle class (median schooling completed, about 12 years). The questions relating to menopause were:

There is no way of estimating the validity of the answers to these questions. However, the questions were simple, and the motivation of the women participating in the study was high. Membership in the Mothers of Twins Clubs is in itself an indication of interest among mothers of twins in themselves and in research on twinning. The matches or controls, selected by the mothers of twins, can be assumed to have been interested in participation. As noted above, the matching procedure was effective for variables such as age, number of children, and socioeconomic characteristics. Because the study was based on voluntary participation and the respondents were self-selected, the sample is not necessarily representative of mothers of twins as a whole or of mothers of singleton children only. Nevertheless, the data for the two groups--mothers of twins or other multiple births and a control group of mothers of singleton children only--are useful for comparative purposes.

Have you stopped having your regular periods? Yes No If yes, is it because of:
A. Change of life (menopause) B. Operation
1 There are fewer respondents among the matches than among the mothers of multiple births because women were asked to return their questionnaires whether or not they were able to find a suitable match for themselves.

Numerous methodological problems relating to the eliciting and analysis of data regarding the menopause have been discussed by McKinlay and McKinlay (1973), Jaszmann et al. (1969), MacMahon and Worcester (1966), Zacharias and Wurtman (1969), and Treloar (1974), among many others. The three main methods are denoted the retrospective method, the pro-

spective method, and the status-quo method. The status-quo method ofanalysis is the oneemployed for theanalysis of this data. According to this method, theexperience of a cross-section of women over the range ofages during which menopause may occur is examined to determine whether or not menstrual periods have stopped. The percentages ofwomen ateach age who have stopped menstruating are used to estimate the mean or median ageat menopause and its standard error. Adetailed descriptionof this method ofestimating mean age, known asprobitanalysis,isgiveninFinney(1971). For our analysis, BMD 03S, a statistical program from the Biomedical Computer programs, 1968,was used (Dixon, 1968).
RESULTS
Table 1 gives full details of the data analyzed in this paper. Respondents to the questions regarding menopause are classified by whether or not they are mothers of multiple births, by number andtype of multiple births, byage at the time of the response, and by menopausal status. The matched controls are those with zero multiple births.
The comparability in age of mothers of twins and of controls is evident from this table. Nearly 5 7per cent of the mothersof twins and 55 per cent of the matched controls were under 35 years. Since very few women experience menopause at ages less than 35 years, these women will not be considered in the subsequent analysis of age at natural menopause. The median age among mothers of twins who were at least 35 years of age was 40.3; for the matches, 40.0. By twin type, the median ages of those 35 and over were: like-sexed twins, 40.3; unlike-sexed twins, 40.5;two or more sets of twins or other multiple births, 40.7. The per cent of respondents in these groups who were under 35 are58

per cent, 57 per cent, and 39 per cent respectively.
Many of the respondents were in the peri-childbearing state and reported a cessation of menstruation because of pregnancy, because they. were in the postpartum period, or because they were breast-feeding. A small number reported that their periods had ceased for reasons such as X-ray therapy for cancer, medical intervention, e.g., D and C , and traumatic events such as death of husband. This group amounts to less than 0.1 per cent of the total number of respondents. In all,

NATURAL MENOPAUSE
The analysis of age at occurrence of natural menopause or age at which menstrual periods have ceased was done using probit analysis.2 Included in the analysis were women 35 years of age and older. The women in the study were classified by their type of offspring into the following groups: (1) the comparison group--no multiple births; (2) any multiple birth; (2a) like-sexed twins; (26) unlikesexed twins; (2c) two or more sets of twins or higher order multiple births. The main findings (Table 2) are as follows.

those respondents whose periods have ceased because of pregnancy, post-partal period, or other reasons not related to natural or operative menopause amount to about 6 per cent of the mothers of multiple births and 8 per cent of the mothers of singleton children only.
The results will be discussed in terms of comparisons between women who are comparable in age and other sociodemographic characteristics butdifferin whether or not they have borne twins. I shall first discuss differences in age at natural menopause and then differences in prevalence of operative menopause.

1. Mothers of multiple births have earlier natural menopause than do women who have had singleton children only. The mean ages are 49.36 and 50.60 years, respectively, with a mean difference and
2 The superiority of the status-quo method (which can be done with probit analysis or logit analysis) is demonstrated with these data. Using the retrospective method of analysis, i.e., comparing average age at menopause from the age at which menopause was reported, yielded no significant differences among the groups compared. In the study reported here we also sought information retrospectively about menarche. Small but significant differences were found between mothers of twins and mothers of singletons only. Gedda (1961) reported that Skerlj in 1939(noreference given) observed that early menarche waslinked with a higher frequency of twin maternities.

standard error of 1.24 ±0.466 (Z = 2.67, p < 0.01). Thus, the mean difference in age at natural menopause between mothers of multiple births and mothers of singletons only is highly significant.
2. Mothers of unlike-sexed twins have earlier natural menopause than do mothers of like-sexed twins. The respective means are 47.99 and 49.77 years, the mean difference and its standard error being 1.78 ± 0.637 (Z = 2.80, p < 0.01). a highly significant difference.
3. Mothers of two or more sets of twins or higher order multiple births-- triplets or quads--have an age at menopause which is intermediate between mothers of like-sexed and unlike-sexed twins, 48.76 ± 1.01.
4. The difference in mean age at menopause between mothers of like-sexed twins and mothers of singletons is not significant, 49.77 versus 50.60 years, with a difference of 0.83 ± 0.463 (Z = 1.79). Like-sexed twins are comprised of both dizygotic (DZ) twins and monozygotic (MZ) twins, in the ratio of 1:2 approximately. DZ twins are borne by women believed to have a genetic tendency to multiple births while MZ twins are not believed to be genetically determined but to occur by chance. Thus, one would expect the experiences of the mothers of like-sexed twins to be a combination of that for mothers of DZ twins and mothers of singleton children only. Based on a ratio of one-third DZ and two-thirds MZ, and assuming that the DZ experience is like that of the mothers of unlike-sexed twins (47.99 years) and that the MZ experience is like that of the mothers of singletons only (50.60 years), the weighted average is 49.73 years. In fact, the mean for the entire group of mothers of like-sexed twins is 49.77 years.
5. Some of the respondents stated whether their like-sexed twins were fraternal (DZ) or identical (MZ). Although the

reliability of the responses relating to zygosity cannot be assessed, like-sexed twins were classified as "DZ," "MZ," or "Not specified." Comparison of mothers of like-sexed fraternal twins and mothers of identical twins shows that the mothers of the former group have a slightly lower age at natural menopause than do mothers in the latter group (49.62 vs. 49.81). The direction of the difference is consistent with that found above with respect to the mothers of unlike-sexed (DZ) and likesexed (MZ and DZ) twins, although the magnitude of the difference is not significant.
6. Finally, the difference in mean age at natural menopause for mothers of unlike-sexed twins and mothers of singletons only is -2.61 years (47.99-50.60), the largest difference observed, with a standard error of 0.639 (Z = 4.08, p < 0.001).
The means and standard errors cited above are given in Table 2. In addition, Table 3, derived from the computer printout, gives estimates of the other parameters of the probit regressions line and their standard errors. Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests are also given to determine whether the observed distributions conform to a normal curve.
OPERATIVE MENOPAUSE
Operative menopause denotes the cessation of menstruation as the result of an operation (surgical in contrast to natural menopause). In Table 4 the prevalence of operative menopause is given by age and by type of birth. Both numerators and denominators in Table 4 exclude women who reported having had a natural menopause. Over all ages, we note that women who have borne only singleton children have a lower prevalence of operative menopause than do women who have had at least one multiple birth, the difference being one-half of one per cent.
We further note that women who have

had like-sexed twins have a lower prevalence than do women who have had unlike-sexed twins, 4.7 per cent compared with 5.3 per cent. Mothers of more than one set of twins or of higher order multiple births also have a lower prevalence than do mothers of unlike-sexed twins. Although the percentages are not based on large numbers, the proportion listing operative menopause is higher in five out of six age groups among mothers of multiple births than among the matches (no multiple births). Similarly, in five out of six age groups, mothers of unlike-sexed twins have had more operative surgery than did mothers of like-sexed twins. If there are genetic or hormonal differences between women who have borne unlike-sexed (DZ) twins and women who have borne likesexed twins (some MZ and some DZ), one would expect the experience of mothers of like-sexed twins to be more like that of mothers of singleton children. This inference is based on the well-accepted premise that MZ twinning is not genetically determined but is a chance event, while DZ twinning is a maternal recessive trait (Bulmer, 1970; Wyshak and White, 1965).

The mothers of singletons only and the mothers of DZ or unlike-sexed twins in the present study constitute the most disparate groups. For these two groups we find that in every age group the prevalence of operative menopause is higher among the women who have had unlike-sexed twins. Based on the sign test, we can conclude that there is a significant difference between these groups with respect to the prevalence of operative menopause (p = 0.031).
DISCUSSION
An association that comes to mind from the results on age at occurrence of natural menopause and prevalence of operative menopause is that mothers of unlike-sexed twins compared with the other mothers, have an experience similar to that of Black women compared with white women. Black women have been found to have earlier natural menopause than do whites in at least two studies (MacMahon and Worcester, 1966; Frere, 1971). MacMahon and Worcester also found that Black women have a higher incidence of opera-

tive menopause than do white women, 16 per cent vs. 13 per cent.
It is well known that Black women have higher DZ twinning rates than do white women (Bulmer, 1970). Wyshak and White (196S) have shown that women who are themselves DZ twins or the female sibs of DZ twins have high DZ twinning rates (based on twinning among their offspring), compared with wives of male DZ twins and wives of male sibs of DZ twins. Their conclusion is that DZ twinning is a maternal recessive trait. In general populations, DZ twinning rates increase by maternal age up to ages 35-39 and then decline. However, Wyshak (1975) has shown that the DZ twinning rate among women who are DZ twins or the female sibs of DZ twins remains high through 40-44 years of age. Reports on Black women also show that their DZ twinning rate remains high beyond 35-39 years of age and does not show a marked decline until after ages 40-44. It has been postulated by Bulmer (1970) and Czeizel and Acsadi (1971) that high DZ twinning rates may be associated with later age at menopause. In fact, our results seem to point to the converse. High DZ twinning rates and, in particular, high rates at later ages, seem to be found in women with earlier ages at natural menopause.
Bulmer (1970, p. 81) claims that the increase in the DZ twinning rate from zero at menarche to its maximum at about 37 years of age may be due to increasing secretion of gonadotrophin; and the sharp fall in the DZ twinning rate from its maximum at age 37 back to zero at menopause is probably a consequence of failing ovarian function as menopause approaches. He further states that since the menopause itself is caused by the cessation of ovarian function when the ovaries run out of follicles, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the menopause is preceded by a period of

60

Wyshak

Social Biology

waning ovarian function when the ovaries are unable to respond fully to gonadotrophic stimulation because they are beginning to run short of follicles.
Our findings seem to negate Bulmer's hypothesis. For women who are DZ twins (or their female sibs) and for Black women, the twinning rate does not decline sharply after age 37, but rather remains high into the 40's. Yet, for these two groups of women, the menopause is slightly earlier (for DZ twins or their female sibs, earlier than for women in the general population; for Black women, earlier than for white women). One can postulate from these findings that prior to the menopause, due to genetic or hormonal factors or an interaction of the two, there is an increase in ovarian activity which leads to double ovulation and dizygotic twinning.
While the primary purpose of this paper has been to provide descriptive data for comparing menopause in selected groups of women, the findings lead to a hypothesis about the cancer experience of mothers of dizygotic twins. Nylander (1973) found that Yoruba women who have borne twins have higher levels of gonadotrophin. Our work (Wyshak, 197S) suggests that women who have had DZ twins have high hormonal levels. Postulating a higher level of gonadotrophins in mothers of DZ twins, Currie (1967) investigated the prevalence of breast cancer among mothers of DZ twins and a matched control group of mothers of singletons only. He found essentially no difference in the occurrence of breast cancer in the two groups; the relative risk was 1.1.
We hypothesize that mothers of DZ twins may show different patterns in the occurrence of cancer of the corpus uteri. Our reasoning is based on the following: Similarities have been observed between mothers of DZ twins and Black women

with respect to twinning at the end of the reproductive span, earlier natural menopause, and a higher prevalence of operative menopause. U.S. mortality rates indicate that cancer of the corpus uteri is higher among Negro women than among white women. For malignant neoplasm of the corpus uteri (ICD 172), of other parts of the uterus including chorionepithelioma (ICD 173), and of uterus unspecified (ICD 174), mortality rates are 6.13 for white females and 11.30 for nonwhite females (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1974). Wynder et al. (1966) remarked about the lack of any reliable figures on racial differences in endometrial cancer, but found in his series the proportion of Blacks "somewhat higher than expected." Our examination of Currie's (1967) data revealed that the relative risk for cancer of the corpus uteri was 2.75 (p = 0.0S9 one-tailed,/) = 0.118 two-tailed) for mothers of DZ twins as compared with the matched control group which consisted of mothers of singletons only. Although Currie's series did not show a statistically significant difference, we feel that the hypothesis that the occurrence of cancer of the corpus uteri is greater in mothers of DZ twins than in the general population warrants further investigation.
SUMMARY
Descriptive data useful for comparing the age at natural menopause and the incidence of operative menopause in mothers of multiple births and mothers of singleton children only have been presented. The data were obtained from self-administered questionnaires sent to women who are members of the National Organization of Mothers of Twins Clubs, Inc. Information regarding the menstrual and reproductive histories of the women was sought. Each club member selected a

mother of singleton children only to serve as a matched control and to respond to the same questionnaire.
The age at natural menopause is significantly earlier in women having had multiple births than in women in the comparison group. Using probit analysis, we found that the mean ages and standard errors are 49.4 ± 0.28 for mothers of multiple births and 50.6 ± 0.37 for mothers of singleton children only. The prevalence of operative menopause was found to be slightly higher among mothers of multiple births. Among mothers of DZ unlike-sexed

twins, the prevalence of operative menopause was significantly higher than among the mothers of singleton children only.
