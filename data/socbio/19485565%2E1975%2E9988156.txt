Unmarried women who became pregnant prior to 1967 in the United States could avoid an illegitimate birth by having an illegal abortion or legitimizing the pregnancy through marriage. Beginning in 1967, legal abortion became a new option in some states. That many unmarried women have taken advantage of the less restrictive policy on abortion is suggested by research showing that 67 per cent of legal abortions are performed for unmarried women (Center for Disease Control, 1972) and that there appears to be an association between legal abortion and declines in illegitimate births (Sklar and Berkov, 1974; Bauman et al., ms.).
The relationship between legal abortion and marriage rates has not been studied, although postponement of marriage could be an important consequence of the change in policy on induced abortion. If many women who become premaritally pregnant terminate their pregnancies through legal abortion and as a result delay marriage, then the marriage rate could decline as a consequence of legal abortions. Two studies infer that legalized abortion might cause a postponement of marriage for some

individuals. Sklar and Berkov (1974) reasoned that the decline in the legitimate birth rate among teenagers in states with legal abortion between 1970 and 1971 might have been produced by fewer marriages forced by premarital pregnancy. Bauman, Udry, and Noyes (ms.) studied the relationship between legalized abortion and fertility trends in 17 United States' cities and expected to find a reduction in legitimate births among high- but not low-parity women since, among the married, legal abortion-birth ratios were substantially higher among the higher parity women. However, the reverse was true. Parity-one legitimate births declined more in cities with legal abortions than in cities without legal abortion, and legitimate birth trends were identical in cities with and without legal abortions for higher parity women. From that, they inferred the high incidence of legal abortions among the unmarried might have produced fewer marriages forced by premarital pregnancy, and hence a decline in parityone legitimate births.
The purpose of this paper is to present our analysis of the relationship between

legal abortion and trends in the crude marriage rate among states in the United States. Our hypothesis is that trends in marriage rates declined more in states with large numbers of legal abortions than in states with relatively few legal abortions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Abortion-birth ratios (number of legal abortions to residents per 1,000 live births) for the second half of 1970 and for all of 1971 for residents of each state in the United States were provided by the Center for Disease Control (see Table 1). We assume that all states had negligible legal abortion-birth ratios prior to 1967 and that no state moved from a higher to lower legal abortion-birth ratio category during the 1967-71 period. Thus, the ranking of states according to their legal abortion-birth ratios in 1970 or 1971 is an acceptably accurate reflection of each state's stability or total increase in legal abortions between 1967 and 1971. Crude marriage rates (number of marriages per 1,000 population) for the years 1967 through 1971 are from publications by the National Center for Health Statistics, U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (1972a, 1974). We excluded Nevada from the analysis due to the extremely large number of nonresident marriages.
We would have preferred age-race specific marriage rates and abortion rates standardized for race and age which included only the unmarried, because they would allow us to determine more precisely whether abortions to the unmarried influenced their marriages. The data necessary for those rates are not available. We assume that the use of more general rates work against a relationship between legal abortion and marriages and therefore that

we are making a conservative test of the hypothesis that legal abortions reduced marriages. Moreover, it is possible that some legal abortions considered to have occurred to residents were actually performed for nonresidents. The extent of that measurement error is unknown, but we presume it would also work against the hypothesis that legal abortions reduced marriages.
We used two different approaches to analyze these data: (1) We categorized states according to four levels of legal abortion-birth ratios--less than SO, 5099, 100-149, and ISO and higher. Within these categories, we averaged the crude marriage rates of the states for each year 1967-71 and compared trends. (2) We calculated rank-order correlations (Kendall TO) between legal abortion-birth ratios and the differences between crude marriage rates for each combination of years 1967-71 for the states. The correlation analysis did not require our establishing cutting points to group states according to level of legal abortion as was the case for the first analysis and provides tests of statistical significance. Both of these analyses were done using the 1971 legal abortion-birth ratios and were repeated with the 1970 ratios.
RESULTS
The averages of the crude marriage rates for 1967-71, for the states categorized according to the four levels of abortion-birth ratios in 1971, are shown in Figure 1. The states with the lowest legal abortion-birth ratios exhibited a linear increase in average crude marriage rates from 1967 to 1971. In states with higher legal abortion-birth ratios the crude marriage rates increased from 196769, with trends generally paralleling the states with the lowest ratios during that

period, but they began to level off in 1970. The states with the highest abortion-birth ratios declined more than other states between 1970 and 1971. Those trends are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a relationship between legalized abortion-birth ratios and trends in crude marriage rates among states between 1967 and 1971, in the direction of reduced crude marriage rates for the states with the relatively high abortion-birth ratios. We repeat the analysis in Figure 2, but this time we use the 1970 legalized abortion-birth ratio rather than the 1971 ratio for categorizing states. The same conclusion is derived.
Some discussion is in order prior to presenting our second analysis. Now that we have seen an association between legalized abortion and the crude marriage rate, we were not surprised to see it appear toward the end of the 1967-71 period rather than earlier. Although 1967 was the first year that a few states enacted a less restrictive policy on induced abortion, we expected some lag between enactment and implementation of the policy; and many of the states with high legal abortion-birth ratios in 1970 and 1971 did not achieve those levels until closer to the end of the five-year period, since they enacted policies after 1967. One final comment on our findings. I t is of interest to note that the crude marriage rate for the United States exhibited an increasing trend from 1959 to 1970, and in 1971 and 1972 began levelling off (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 19726). Although there could be numerous explanations for that change in trend, the preceding analyses suggest one hypothesis should be that it might be in part attributable to the change in policy on induced abortion.
In our second analysis, we hypothesize that the ranks of states on legal abortion-

birth ratios would be negatively correlated with ranks of states on changes in the crude marriage rates. Having already seen the trend analysis presented above, we expected to see the correlations appear for the later but not earlier years during the 1967-71 period. The correlations were sig-

nificant at the a ±= 0.05 level, and in the predicted direction, when associating the ranks of the 1971 abortion-birth ratio with the ranks of the differences between the crude marriage rate in 1971 and the crude marriage rates in each of the other years 1967-70. However, the correlations

analyses. Different denominators might yield different conclusions. Therefore, we calculated different measures to rank states on legal abortions by retaining the number of legal abortions for the numerators and substituting the following for the numbers of births in the denominators: (1) the number of women age 1544; (2) the number of single women age 15-44; and (3) the number of legal abortions plus number of live births. The rank-order correlations for the relationships of each of these measures with the differences in marriage rates between 1971 and each year 1967-70 are shown in Table 4, along with the comparable correlations derived when using the 1971 legal abortion-birth ratios. The results using the different ratios and rates are virtually identical. As was the case in Tables 2 and

3, none of the correlations of these different legal abortion measures with differences in marriage rates prior to 1971 were statistically significant (not shown). We conclude that all rates and ratios we used to rank states on legal abortions produced the same results when correlated with the ranks of differences in marriage rates.
Although we demonstrated an association between legalized abortion and crude marriage rates, we cannot be certain it is a causal relationship. One reason for our uncertainty is that both legalized abortion and marriage rate trends might be related to a common variable which produced a spurious association. For example, major federal support for family planning services began early in the 1967-71 period. If many recipients of those services were unmarried, their participation might have reduced forced marriages. A correlation between the state's abortion-birth ratios and use of family planning services by the unmarried could have produced the association between legal abortion and trends in the crude marriage rate. Or, perhaps the unmarried are increasingly finding such substitutes for early marriage as professional careers and find the social milieu of states with legal abortions more conducive to delaying early marriage to
