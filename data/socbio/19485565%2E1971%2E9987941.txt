Indications of Recent Demographic Change among Blacks*

During the last thirty years, there have been major changes in race relations within the United States. On one hand, the institutions of our society have taken several steps which may have improved the status of blacks. The Fair Employment Practices Act of the 1940's was followed by numerous judicial decisions in the 195t)'s which banned discrimination and then, in the 1960's, programs designed to mitigate poverty and increase school readiness flourished. In recent years, private employers have advertised their willingness to hire and promote blacks while numerous universities have intensively recruited black students. One might anticipate that these programs would go far toward incorporating blacks into our society and improving their socioeconomic status. Nevertheless, during this period, racial riots flared, many violent deaths occurred, and persistent patterns of racial segregation and racial differences in poverty are obvious to anyone who examines the nation's larger cities.
The decennial census enumerations provide excellent detailed descriptions of the

changing characteristics of our population. From them, we can learn much about the location and characteristics of both blacks and whites. We can readily test hypotheses about whether racial differences in socioeconomic status have diminished or grown wider, and we may be able to gain some insights into factors which account for changes in the status of blacks or whites.
This paper begins with a description of the growth rate of the black and white populations. Next, there is an account of the changing residential distribution of blacks within this country. Regional and city-suburban growth rates for blacks are compared to similar rates for whites. The remainder of the paper examines the hypothesis that the socioeconomic status of blacks, relative to whites, has improved in recent decades. Demographic data concerning education, occupation, and income are examined.
At present, the federal statistical agencies tabulate data for the white, the black, and the other-races population. Wherever possible, figures for the white and black populations have been analyzed. In the past, however, many tabulations were available only for whites and nonwhites and these have been used when necessary.

The vast majority of nonwhites in the United States are Negroes; for example in 1970, 89% of all nonwhites were blacks (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1971a, Table 2).
THE CHANGING GROWTH RATE OF THE BLACK POPULATION
When the Constitution -was ratified, Negroes comprised about one-fifth of the total population. For a few decades after the Revolution, the white and black populations grew at about the same rate, that is, 2 to 3 % each year (Taeuber and Taeuber, 1967). An annual rate of growth of 2.5% doubles a population in less than thirty years. Since the actual growth rates exceeded this, both the white and black populations were doubling every generation prior to the Civil War.
Following Emancipation, the growth rate among blacks declined for many decades sinking to a minimum during the Depression decade when the growth rate was under one per cent each year. Among whites, growth rates after the Civil War were lower than before, although immigration buoyed the white rate until the mid-1920's. In general, then, the white population grew more rapidly than the black for a period of about a century and, as a result, blacks comprised a smaller and smaller share of the total population. By 1940 only 9.7% of the population was black (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1961a, Table 44).
The growth rates of both whites and blacks have moved in a similar direction since 1940. The growth rate rose gradually during World War II, increased more rapidly after the war, and remained at a relatively high level throughout the 1950's. Since the late 195O's, the growth rates of both groups declined. Percentage change in population by race, for five-year periods between 1940 and 1970 are shown in

Table 1 (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1970a, Table 3).
The increase in the growth rate, which occurred during and after World War II, was greater among blacks than among whites, and the decreases, during the 1960's, were smaller among blacks. Consequently, the racial difference in growth rates has grown larger. In 1969-70, for instance, the black population grew at an annual rate of 1.8%, while the white population grew by 1% (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1970a, Table 3). As a result of these higher growth rates, blacks now comprise about 11.2% of the population (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1971a, Table 2).

FERTILITY TRENDS
A population's natural increase represents the difference between its fertility and mortality rates, and these rates must be considered in describing population growth. The major reason for more rapid population growth after 1940 was a rise in fertility; the decrease in the growth rate during the 1960's is accounted for primarily by a drop in birth rates.
Women who were born around 1910 attained childbearing ages during the Depression and, in an historical context, these women had uniquely small families. These black women averaged about two

and one-half children, and the white women averaged just over two. The longrun trend toward smaller families ended in the 1940's. After World War II, age at marriage dropped sharply and couples had many children rapidly after they married. Family size has risen and the women who were born during the Depression--women who began their childbearing during the late 1940's and 1950's --will bear many children. By the completion of their fertility, white women are likely to average three children and black women about four (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1961¿, 1969a, 19706 and 19716). This shift to higher fertility rates and larger families produced higher rates of population growth during the 195O's.
During the 1960's, fertility rates declined sharply. Many young women who got off to rapid starts on their childbearing during the 195O's compensated by having fewer children when they were at older ages. Among both blacks and whites, fertility rates at age 35 and over are now lower than ever before (U. S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1969, Tables 1-8). Simultaneously, young women who reached childbearing ages during the 1960's married at a somewhat later age and got off to a rather slow start on childbearing.
Although fertility rates have fallen for a decade, we cannot be certain that small families are now the rule or that our population will grow at a low rate. Since the mid-1950's, there have been survey studies which interview American women and ask their fertility expectations (Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell, 19S9; Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966; Ryder and Westoff, 1967; Davidson, 1971). Married couples consistently report that they expect to have two to four children, the average being just over three. The fertility expectations reported in the most

recent survey, conducted in 1967, are quite similar to those of the earliest year, 19SS. If these fertility expectations are accurate, the fertility rates of both blacks and whites will go up during the 197O's as the women who delayed having children during the 1960's build their families.
Most of these studies indicate that Negro women expect to bear more children than white women. However, this is not true for all groups. Nonwhite women who have a complete high school education or who grew up away from the rural South make use of contraception and have fertility patterns like those of similar white women (Whelpton, Campbell and Patterson, 1966, Chap. 9). Nonwhite women who lived in the rural South or who grew up in the rural South had exceptionally high fertility. Indeed, one group of investigators argued that the chief reason why black fertility rates exceeded those of whites was the high fertility of rural black women. They predicted that as blacks became urbanized and educational attainment increased, there would be a convergence of black and white fertility rates (Whelpton, Campbell and Patterson, 1966, p.369).
MORTALITY TRENDS
The mortality rates which prevail in a population may reflect much about that population's living conditions as well as the society's investments in health and welfare. Mortality trends are best summarized by the expectation of life at birth. This indicates the number of years a person will live if the mortality rates, observed in the year of birth, remain unchanged. In 1940, nonwhites in the United States had a life expectation of 53 years which was eleven years shorter than the white life expectation of 64 years. After 1940, death rates among both races were reduced because of improved standards of living--that is, improved diets and hous-

ing--and because of medical innovations. The growing use of antibiotics, for example, mitigated deaths from infections and contagious diseases.
Most of the reductions in mortality occurred between the late 1930's and the mid-1950's. Since 1955 there have been no more than modest improvements in the death rates, primarily because a very high proportion of deaths are associated with the aging process. There will be no dramatic increase in life expectation in the future unless some way is found to abate the biological degeneration which occurs at the oldest ages. The elimination of the remaining infectious diseases, even the elimination of cancer as a cause of death, will do no more than increase the expectation of life by a few years (U. S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1968).
Reductions in mortality have been somewhat greater among nonwhites than among whites and, as a result, the racial gap in life expectation has narrowed. By 1968, the most recent year for which data are available, the nonwhite life expectation was 64 years, which is 7 years behind the white figure. At present, as in the past, death rates for both sexes and at most ages are higher among nonwhites than among whites. There is only a small racial difference in the accidental death rate but for death due to cardiovascular-renal causes, from malignant neoplasms, influenza, diabetes, cirrhosis, and tuberculosis, the rates are higher among nonwhites than among whites. The nonwhite infant mortality rate remains much greater than that for whites, although the racial gap with regard to infant mortality has narrowed in the last few years (U.S. Public Health Service, 1970, Table 5).
In the future there are likely to be some modest reductions in the mortality rate and these may be somewhat greater among nonwhites than among whites. However,

the major determinant of the future growth rate will be fertility, not mortality.
The census bureau's population projections indicate that the black population will continue to grow more rapidly than the white in the future. Blacks will comprise a larger component of the total population, although the change in racial composition is unlikely to be very great. For instance, with rapid population growth, by 1990 blacks will make up about 13 to 14% of the national population (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1968, Tables 1 and 6).
THE CHANGING LOCATION OF BLACKS
REGIONAL CHANGES
At the time of the Civil War approximately nine out of ten blacks lived within the South and this did not change in the decades which followed Emancipation. Some blacks sought jobs in the cities of the North or settled on the western plains but their numbers were few, and the census of 1900 discovered that 90% of all Negroes were in the South.
The major migration of blacks away from the South began during World War I, because northern industries required many more workers at a time when the European hostilities had cut off the immigration of white foreigners. The declining economic conditions in southern agriculture also impelled blacks to move north. This substantial out-migration of southern Negroes has continued to the present. The rate of migration slowed in the Depression, then increased to a very high level during World War II--the first period in which large numbers of Negroes elected to move to the western states, primarily California. After the war, the migration process did not stop; rather, large numbers of Negroes moved away from the South and into the cities of the North and West throughout the 1950's and 1960's (Taeuber and Taeuber, 1967, p. 108-116).

This population redistribution produced shifts in the location of Negroes. The top panel of Table 2 shows the regional distribution of blacks and whites at dates from 1900 to 1970, while the lower panel displays the regional growth rates for the three most recent decennial spans. We observe that in recent decades the black population in the western and north central states has been growing most rapidly and, by 1970, just under one-half of the Negro population resided outside the South. Nonetheless, the southern black population has grown and is now larger than ever before,
Shifts in the regional distribution of whites are somewhat different and less pronounced than among blacks. For whites, the West has been the region experiencing most rapid growth, although the southern states have also been increasing at a high rate. As a result, the proportion of whites who live in the South or West has risen; the proportion in the northeastern or north central states has fallen.
URBANIZATION
The regional redistribution of blacks has occurred simultaneously with the urbanization of blacks. Almost all the black out-

migrants from the South relocated themselves in or near cities and, within the South, there has been a shift away from agriculture on the part of both whites and blacks.
The census bureau's definition of urban residence has changed from time to time which impedes an analysis of long-term changes. However, we can assemble comparable data for the period 1940 to 1969 which are shown in Table 3. In 1960, the census bureau defined 212 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA), each of which consisted of one or more central cities of at least 50,000 and the surrounding county area. This system permits us to describe fluctuations in the composition of central cities and their suburban rings, that is, the portion of the SMSA outside the central city. The nonmetropolitan area consists of all people who do not live in metropolitan areas--people who are on farms and in smaller cities. The first panel of Table 3 indicates the numbers of people who lived in each type of area; the second p a n e l s h o w s fa distribution of whites and blacks by place of residence; and the final panel indicates the growth rates in the recent period.

SOÜSCES: U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1961a, Table 44; 1961c, Table 1; 1971/, Table 2. * Each percentage reflects the change from the previous decade, e.g., percentages given under 1950 reflect the change from 1940, and so on.

In 1940, over one-half of the black population was located in nonmetropolitan areas, but this changed during and after World War II. The metropolitan population expanded rapidly while the nonmetropolitan population actually declined, so that by 1970 70% lived within SMSA's. Among whites, there was also a rapid growth of the metropolitan population and relatively slow growth of the nonmetropolitan population.
Within metropolitan areas, there was a great racial disparity in the growth rates. The white population within central cities reached a peak between 19S0 and 1960 and

declined by at least two million during the following decade. The suburban white population, however, grew very rapidly. Indeed, all the post-World War II rise in the metropolitan white population can be accounted for by increases in suburban population.
Among blacks, metropolitan growth has occurred primarily because of rising populations within central cities. To be sure, the growth rate of the suburban population has been substantial, but suburban areas contained relatively few blacks both in 1940 and 1970. The result has been a large difference in the color composition of cen-

tral cities and their suburban rings. Blacks comprise almost 35% of the cities' population, but only 5% in the suburban rings.
The census of 1970 discovered black majorities in three major central cities-- Washington (71%), Newark (54%) and Atlanta (51%). In three other large cities blacks made up well over 40% of the population--Baltimore (46%), New Orleans (45%) and Detroit (44%). The proportion black in the suburban rings surrounding these central cities was much smaller--8% in Washington, 10% in Newark, 6% in Atlanta and Baltimore, 13% in New Orleans, and 4% in Detroit (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1971c).
RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION
Within metropolitan areas, the residences of Negroes tend to be segregated from those of whites. In an exhaustive study of the available data, the Taeubers (1965) found that residential segregation was prevalent both in cities of the North and of the South, in large cities and in smaller ones. They demonstrated that economic factors did not account for residential segregation; rather, well-to-do blacks were segregated from whites of the same economic level just as impoverished blacks were segregated from impoverished whites.
We do not know whether the residential segregation of the races increased or decreased during the 1960's. One exploratory study, analyzing data collected in a small number of cities between 1964 and 1967, discovered modest increases in residential segregation. Summarizing their work, Farley and Taeuber (1968, p. 954) concluded:
Putting these results together with those for 1940-60, there is strong evidence that the pervasive pattern of residential segregation has not been significantly breached. Whether the temporal trend for a particular city has been up, down or fluctuating, the magnitude of the change has been small. Stability in segregation patterns has been maintained despite massive demographic transforma-

tion, marked advances in Negro economic welfare, urban renewal and other clearance and resettlement programs, considerable undoubling of living quarters and diminished room crowding, high vacancy rates in many of the worst slums, and an array of federal, state and local anti-discrimination laws and regulations.
CHANGES IN EDUCATION
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT
During the last thirty years, the educational attainment of the adult population has increased dramatically. Among black men, for example, the rise in median years of school completed was from 5".4 years in 1940 to 9.9 years in 1970; among white men the change was from 8.7 to 12.2 years. Similar increases occurred in the educational attainment of women. This has occurred primarily because young people are remaining in school much longer now than in the past. For example, only 15% of the black men who were teenagers during the Depression completed high school; but by the late 1960's, over 60% of the black teenagers were finishing secondary school (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1963a, Table 176; 19696, p. 49-51). Table 4 shows the educational attainment distribution of nonwhite and white adults for dates between 1940 and 1970.
We observe a reduction in the proportion who have had only an elementary education and a sharp rise in the proportion with a high school or college degree among all groups. Within the white community, there has been only a small difference in the attainment of men and women. However, black females have traditionally received more education than black males. This has gradually changed and by 1970 the attainment of black men approximated that of black females.
The educational attainment of whites exceeds that of blacks, and it is important to ascertain whether this racial difference has diminished or grown wider in recent

years. There are a variety of indices which could be used to compare the attainment of blacks and whites. The one we chose is delta or the Index of Dissimilarity (Duncan and Duncan, 1955). This index is useful for comparing two groups which are distributed among categories such as educational attainment levels. Suppose there were no racial differences in the years of school completed by blacks and whites. Then if 10% of all whites completed a specified number of school years, we would expect 10% of all blacks to have a similar number of school years. If this were the case for every attainment level, delta would equal zero implying no racial difference in educational attainment. If, on the other hand, all blacks were concentrated at certain educational levels and all whites at

other levels, delta would equal 100, indicating no overlap in the distribution of whites and blacks by education. Thus, this index ranges from 0 to -j-100. Low values suggest racial similarity while large values suggest just the opposite. Table 4 contains deltas comparing the educational attainment of blacks and whites.
The figures in Table 4 indicate an increase in educational attainment and a reduction in the racial difference throughout the period 1940 to 1970. The decade 1950 to 1960 witnessed a rather sharp drop in the racial difference. The rise in the proportion of blacks who completed secondary school appears particularly sharp during the 1960's, but there was an equally large jump in the percentage of whites who completed high school. We conclude that

Vol. 18, No. 4

educational attainment increased and racial differentiation decreased in the 1960's, just as it did in the two previous decades. Nevertheless in 1970, as in 1940, the educational attainment of whites exceeded that of blacks. We note that these figures refer to years of schooling completed. They do not measure, in a direct way, qualitative dimensions of learning.
SCHOOL ENROLLMENT
Racial differences in educational attainment are smaller among the young than among those who are older. We may be able to assess recent changes and future trends by analyzing school enrollment patterns. If racial differences in attainment are soon to disappear, we would anticipate similar enrollment rates among blacks and whites who are now teenagers or of college age. Table 5 presents enrollment rates for the population age 14 to 29 by age, sex, and color for the most recent census years, 1960 and 1970. Some caution is needed in interpreting trends since the 1960 data come from the decennial census while the 1970 data were obtained by the Current Population Survey.
There has been a general increase in school enrollment as well as some upgrading of enrollment. That is, among those who are enrolled, the proportion in college was typically greater in 1970 than in 1960.
When enrollment rates of blacks are scrutinized, we observe sharp increases at ages 16 to 21. By 1970 approximately onequarter of the black men and one-fifth of the black women of college age attended colleges or universities. This is approximately the proportion of the same age groups of whites who were enrolled in college in 1960.
Among whites, the increases in enrollment at ages 18 to 21 are at least as great as among Negroes, while at ages 22 and over, the increases were much sharper

among whites. These changes in enrollment suggest that racial differences in enrollment through the completion of high school are gradually being reduced. It is likely that, in the future, roughly equal proportions of whites and blacks will graduate from secondary school. However, at college ages, racial differences in enrollment seem to be increasing because of the recent jump in the enrollment of whites. These enrollment data imply that there will continue to be racial differences in educational attainment and that the proportion with a college education will continue to be much greater among whites (for further discussion of racial differences in educational attainment see Price, 1969, Chapter 6.)
EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION
LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT
Blacks and whites in the United States differ both with regard to their participation in the labor force and the occupation pursued by those who are employed. We begin this section by describing changes in the labor force status of adults and their unemployment rate.
Table 6 shows the proportion of blacks and whites, age 16 and over, who were in the labor force at dates between 1940 and 1970. Since the end of World War II, the proportion of adult men who are in the labor force, that is, who are at work or looking for work, has declined among both whites and nonwhites. This has occurred, in part, because of earlier retirements and the trend toward greater educational attainment. The decline in labor force participation, however, has been sharper among nonwhites and labor force participation rates at all ages are considerably lower among nonwhite men than among white. Demographic data do not explain why participation rates are relatively low among nonwhite males, but several labor

force analysts hypothesize that some men may have withdrawn from the labor force because they could not secure suitable work (Bancroft, 19S8, p. 49-52; Bowen and Finegan, 1969, p. 49-53). They would argue that the low rate of labor force participation among Negro men, as well as the high unemployment rate, reflect the severe problems many black men face in securing an income.
Among women, both nonwhite and white, there has been a marked rise in labor force participation. These rates apparently went up very sharply during World War II, fell back a bit after the war, and then resumed their climb in the 195O's. In recent years, the increase in labor force participation has been greater among white women. Nevertheless, at every date for which information is available, the participation rate was higher among nonwhite women.
The unemployment rate is a highly sensi-

tive indicator of current economic conditions. During the 1930's unemployment rates were very high, but in the following decade, when there was complete mobilization for the war, they fell to all-time lows. Since the end of World War II, the unemployment rate has fluctuated in response to the economic situation. In the early 1950's, during the Korean conflict, this rate was at a low level. Later in that decade and during the early 1960's, unemployment rates rose to a rather high level. During the mid1960's, as the federal government introduced many domestic programs and increased involvement in the southeast Asian war, unemployment rates declined, reaching a minimum in 1969. Since early 1970, the unemployment rate has climbed, and by early 1971 was at the same level as in 1964.
There is scant evidence that nonwhites have made much progress in terms of the unemployment situation since the end of

World War II. If we look at the data for males, we see that at every date since 1948, the nonwhite unemployment rate has been one and one-half to two times as large as that for whites. Among females, the nonwhite unemployment rate has consistently been about one and one-half times that of whites. In addition, a relatively large proportion of black men are not in the labor force.
OCCUPATIONS OF THE EMPLOYED
Racial changes in the occupations pursued by employed workers are more easily described. Table 7 shows the occupational distributions by race and sex for the period 1940 to 1970. The data for the initial three dates come from decennial censuses while those for 1970 were obtained in a census bureau survey of £0,000 households. This table also indicates the 1960 to 1970 change in the number of nonwhites and whites employed in particular occupations.
If the occupations of men are considered, we observe that the proportion of both nonwhites and whites who worked at professional and managerial jobs rose while the proportion working on farms has plummeted. This trend toward upgrading of the occupational distribution has resulted from urbanization and the increasing need for highly skilled workers, for professionals, and for managers. We note sharp increases, particularly during the 1960's, in the number of nonwhite men employed at white collar (professional, managerial, clerical, or sales) jobs or as craftsmen. Indeed, rates of increase for nonwhites in these occupations have been much greater than the corresponding rates for whites.
Changes among women are analogous to those occurring among men. Employment in white collar jobs has grown much more rapidly than employment in manual jobs. Over time, the number of women working

on farms has declined, although the April 1970 survey found more white women who were employed as farm laborers than did the census of 1960. The occupational distribution of nonwhite women has been upgraded more rapidly than that of whites, because the proportion employed at white collar jobs rose more rapidly among nonwhites.
Data in Table 7 imply that nonwhites made occupational gains in the recent decades. Racial differentiation in occupational structure can be measured by computing deltas to compare the distributions of employed whites and nonwhites. Eleven occupational categories were used in these calculations. Table 7 contains these deltas computed for the years 1940 to 1970.
Among males, there was a reduction in racial differentiation during the 1940's, probably a consequence of the changes associated with the tremendous increase in the need for workers during World War II. In the following decade, there was little change in the value of delta; but during the 1960's there was a further reduction in the racial difference as the occupational distribution of blacks improved.
In 1940, three out of four employed nonwhite females labored on farms or as domestic help. This declined rapidly and there have been sharp rises, especially in the last ten years, in the proportion of nonwhite women who hold professional, clerical, or service jobs. As a result, racial differentiation has dropped and the occupational distributions of blacks and whites have become more alike.
SUMMARY
Many of the changes in employment and occupation indicate that nonwhites improved their status somewhat more rapidly than whites. An increasingly large proportion of blacks are obtaining white collar

and craftsmen jobs and, as a consequence, racial differences are smaller now than they were in the past. Nevertheless, racial differences are by no means negligible. The proportion of men who are participants in the labor force remains lower among nonwhites and the unemployment rate for blacks is almost twice that of whites. Furthermore, despite the progress of this period, the proportion of workers with white collar jobs is nearly twice as great among whites as among nonwhites.
INCOME TRENDS
The previous sections have analyzed changes in several important demographic dimensions. Next, we will describe some trends in income. Unfortunately we cannot establish a lengthy series on this topic. The census of 19S0 was the first to include a detailed question on income, and census bureau surveys began to collect income statistics from samples of the population in the post-World War II era. We are restricted to examination of trends in the last twenty-five years.
This has been a prosperous span and family incomes have risen rapidly as canbe

seen by examining Table 8 which displays median income figures for white and nonwhite families. These are given in terms of 1969 dollars. The actual incomes reported for these years were adjusted for inflation and consequently increases in income, as indicated by this table, represent real improvements in purchasing power. If we consider the entire span from 1947 to 1969, we see that the real income of white families rose 87%; of nonwhites, 130%. If the decade of the 1960's is considered, the rises are 38% among whites, 69% among nonwhites.
The income of whites exceeds that of nonwhites, and it is important to ascertain whether this racial difference has diminished or grown wider. A variety of measures could be used. We selected three and show them in Table 8. First, there is the ratio of median incomes. Second, there is the index of dissimilarity or delta. Third, is the Gini index. This is a Lorenz curve measure which has been frequently used to assess inequities in income distributions. Its range differs from that of delta; specifically it varies from --100 through 0 to +100. A Gini index of + 1 0 0 indicates there is no

overlap of the income distributions of the two races and that all whites have higher incomes than any blacks. A value of zero indicates complete overlap and no racial differentiation in income, while a value of --100 means there is no overlap and all blacks are at higher income levels than any whites (Miller, 1966, p. 220-221).
The numerical value of the delta and Gini indices depend upon the number and breadth of the income categories used in their computation. Those shown in Table 8 have been calculated from an income distribution composed of six categories. They cannot be compared to the delta indices which measure racial differences in education or occupation.
The measures displayed in Table 8 show that racial differences in family income have declined. The ratio of nonwhite to white income has risen and the delta and Gini indices have fallen which implies increasing similarity of the income distributions.
Different periods have been characterized by different trends. Between 1947 and the later 195O's, there was little reduction in racial differentiation. During the Korean War years, incomes rose somewhat more rapidly among nonwhites, but the reverse was true later in the 19S0's. (Data not shown in this paper. For further discussion see: Henson, 1967, Table 1; Weitzman, 1970, Table B.) In the early 1960's there was some improvement in nonwhite income relative to white, but the greatest changes were concentrated between 1965 and 1969. For each measure, the gain in the fouryear period following 1965 exceeded that of the eighteen-year span, 1947 to 1965.
Despite these advances, the income of nonwhites trails far behind that of whites. The real purchasing power of the typical nonwhite family in 1969 was probably no greater than that of the average white family fifteen years earlier. The absolute

racial difference in purchasing power--as measured by the difference in median incomes--did not decrease during the 1960's.
Improvements in income are evident among both husband-wife families and those headed by a woman. However, the relative gains by blacks are greatest among husband-wife families headed by young men. For instance, in 1969, Negro husbandwife families headed by a man between 25 and 34 had median incomes 77% as great as those of comparable white families. This comes about partially because of the relatively favorable economic position of young blacks, but also because the proportion of wives who are in the labor force is greater among black families than white. When the comparison is restricted to young husbandwife families in which the wife was not in the labor force, we discover that black families had median incomes in 1969 only 70% as large as those of whites (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970c, Table 17). Poverty must be very common among black families headed by women. In 1969, they reported a median income of $3,300 and included an average of two children. Similar white families--that is, those headed by a woman--reported a median income of $5,500 and included an average of only one child (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970c, Table 17; 1971rf, Table 4).
Many discussions of contemporary racial inequities point out that blacks with a given education or holding a specific job receive lower incomes than whites with similar educations or occupations (Siegel, 1965; Duncan, 1969). As an exploratory study, we analyzed data which permitted us to assess the relationship of income to education in 1959 and 1969. That is, using data for individuals, we regressed reported income on reported educational attainment to measure the average payoff in income for educational attainment. Specifically, we solved the regression equation, y = a -f- bx

where y represents income and x, years of school completed. The results (based on U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1963Ô, Tables 6 and 7; 1970c, Table 47) appear in Table 9.
These figures refer to income in 1968 dollars. The average values of y and x show the increases in education and income which developed between 19S9 and 1969. For each of the four groups, the correlation coefficient, r, rose suggesting that the relationship of income to education became somewhat stronger during the 1960's. At present, among men, education accounts for about 20% of the variance in reported income.
Regression coefficients, the b's, measure the income received, on the average, for each year of schooling. The regression coefficients for black men show an improvement between 1959 and 1969 in the income associated with education. An additional year of school used to be worth $279, but by 1968 its value was $433. Simultaneously, the returns white men received increased, although at a lower rate. As a

result, the racial difference in the payoff for educational attainment was somewhat less than at the end of the 1960's a decade earlier. Black men at a given education level still have much smaller incomes than whites with the same education.
Among women, the picture is quite different. We see that the correlation coefficients are considerably greater for nonwhites implying a racial difference in the way in which women use their educations to secure income. It may be that some black women seek the most lucrative jobs since their husbands earn relatively little, while white women may take other factors into account such as place of employment or timing of the working day. Between 19S9 and 1969, the income returns black women received for education rose sharply, more rapidly among nonwhites than among whites. Consequently, nonwhite women receive just about as much for each year of schooling as do white women. Overall, of course, nonwhite females report fewer years of education
