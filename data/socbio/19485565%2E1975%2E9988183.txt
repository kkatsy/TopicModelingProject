The Genetic Structure of a Tribal Population, the Yanomama Indians. XII. Biodemographic Studies. J V. Neel and K. M. Weiss. Amer. J. Phys. Anthropol, 42(1975):25-5l.
Vital data on about 2,600 individuals permit the construction of life tables and population models more realistic than any previously available for a primitive population. While probably not typical of all ancestral human societies, the results indicate high mortality rates, low sterility rates, prevalence of polygamous reproduction, and significant regulation of fertility by abortion and infanticide. Informants' reports leave some of the apparent mortality unaccounted for.

diseases or when frequency of the trait has changed between parent and offspring generations.
Experimental Evidence on Limitations of the Heritability Parameter. H. H. Meyer and F. D. Enfield. Theoret. Appl, Genet., 45(1975):268-273.
The proportion of variance accounted for by additive genetic factors (heritability) may vary systematically even within a single experimental population. Body size in beetles, seemingly an ideal quantitative trait, showed higher heritability in the extremes of the range and especially at very low body weight. There was, however, good agreement between parent-offspring regression and response to selection.

A New Simplified Method for Estimating Relative Fitness in Man. K. Tanaka. Jap. J. Hum. Genet., 19(1974): 195-202.

An Axiomatic Interpretation of the NeoDarwinian Theory of Evolution. C. L. Harris. Perspect. Biol. Med., 18(1975): 179-184.

The relative reproductive fitness of individuals affected by a pathological trait can be usefully estimated from family data by taking the ratio of disease incidence in parents of index cases to disease incidence in offspring of index cases. The author derives the formula separately for traits ascertained at birth and in adulthood, for autosomal and for sex-linked traits. The method is not applicable to rare recessive

The Neo-Darwinian theory of evolution rests upon two axioms which, like those of physics and mathematics, are accepted because plausible alternatives have not been proposed: (1) All heritable variations in fitness are the result of chance mutations. (2) There is natural selection for fitness. These axioms cannot be tested; proof of (1) would require proof of a negative, and any explicit statement of (2) is a tautology.

A Theory of Group Selection. D. S. Wilson. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 72 (1975): 143-146.
Separation of a breeding population into temporary subdivisions which later intermingle in the same generation permits natural selection of groups exhibiting altruism under less stringent conditions than heretofore supposed. Though relatively less fit within their group, the altruists may have a higher fitness in the population at large because of higher survival of the groups to which they belong. Differences between groups with respect to frequency of the trait must exceed chance variation if self-sacrifice is involved.
COMMENT: The author denies that genetic drift is necessary in his model, but the mechanisms by which he derives greaterthan-random variation between groups are, I believe, forms of genetic drift. At least, the trait must drift to a substantial frequency to produce subpopulations with more than one self-sacrificing altruist other than close kin.

COMMENT: The levels of evolution brought into contrast here probably correspond not to genes and regulators, but to genes that determine specifically human development (embryonic proteins) and genes that serve a common function in man and ape.
Half-Chromatid Mutations: Transmission in Humans? S. M. Gartler and U. Francke. Amer. J. Hum. Genet., 21 (1975):218-223.
If a mutation occurred during or after the last gene replication before gamete formation, it would yield a mosaic individual, and such individuals would often not manifest their mutant genotype. These mutations would be likely to escape detection in studies of radiation damage and may therefore be important. Lesch-Nyhan disease presents an ideal situation in which to detect such events, but examination of two families where transmission was compatible with mosaic carriers proved negative. Obviously many cases are needed.

Evolution at Two Levels in Humans and Chimpanzees. M.-C. King and A. C. Wilson. Science, 188(1975):107-116.

COMMENT: / / point mutations are almost equally probable in every cell generation, the proportion of mutations occurring just at gamete formation may be very small.

Human evolution may have to be explained not in terms of gene mutations but in terms of changes in the regulation and expression of those genes. Thorough studies of man and chimpanzee reveal protein differences no greater than those found elsewhere within pairs of extremely similar species. The great divergence between man and chimpanzee in anatomy and behavior is undoubtedly mainly due to genetic change in man, and yet the proteins of the two species show the same (small) degree of evolutionary divergence from a common ancestor.

Independent Transmission of IQ and Schizophrenia. M. B. Jones and D. R. Offord. Brit. J. Psychiat., 126(1975): 185-190.
It appears that IQ is not depressed by the genes causing schizophrenia, although low IQ increases susceptibility to the psychosis. It has long been known that schizophrenic patients tend to have lower premorbid IQ than their sibs, and this lower IQ has sometimes been interpreted as a prodromal effect of the disease. New data on 85 sibships yield correlations be-

tween probands and sibs equal to those among the unaffected sibs, and the correlations are in the usual range for sibs, around 0.40.
COMMENT: Although these results clearly differ from those previously cited as supporting an effect of schizophrenia on IQ, they do not in themselves contradict that hypothesis. A lowering of IQ by schizophrenia would not decrease product-moment correlations if the effect was very uniform. The authors' data do not show increased correlation among the normal sibs, to be expected if schizophrenia selectively affected the members with lowest IQ.
Isoenzymes of Hexokinase in Human Muscular Dystrophy. J. M. Strickland and D. A. Ellis. Nature, 253(1975): 464-466.
An enzyme that metabolizes sugar in skeletal muscle is found to be abnormal in

dystrophic patients, both in muscles and in
other internal organs. A component of
hexokinase that normally comprises two
strong electrophoretic bands is distributed
among three feeble bands in both sex-linked
forms of muscular dystrophy (Duchenne
and Becker types). This distribution may
be related to the abnormal metabolism of
glucose in these two diseases, previously
reported by the same authors.
