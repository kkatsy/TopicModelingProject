Information about the Juruna Indians dates back to 1625, when Parente (1874) localized them near the mouth of the Xingu River. Adalbert (1849) seems to have been the first to give a population estimate of the Juruna. As for the Indians of the Upper Xingu River, the first data were obtained in Karl von den Steinen's first expedition which took place in 1884. A few years later (1896) Herman Meyer also explored the area. With Meyer came Karl E. Ranke, who collected valuable information about the health status of these Indians and the demography of two villages of Trumai and Nahuqua Indians (Ranke, 1898). Since then, numerous papers have appeared, especially on the ethnology of these groups. Data about their blood groups and physical status have also been reported in some ten articles during the last twenty years. However, the demographic information is scanty, scattered over many sources, and generally includes only population numbers. The present report will describe demographic data collected by the senior author during four months of field work, in 1966 and 1967, among the Juruna Indians of this region. Their most significant features will be

analyzed and compared with earlier reports about the genetic structure of other Brazilian and Venezuelan Indians (Salzano, 1961, 1964; Salzano, Neel, and Maybury-Lewis, 1967; Neel and Chagnon, 1968).
POPULATION SIZE
Table 1 presents the figures we have been able to collect concerning the population sizes of the Juruna from 1842 to 1967. The first estimate of 2,000, by Adalbert, may be too high, since Nimuendaju (1948) reports only 235 Indians in 1859. The fact is that by the end of the nineteenth century the Juruna were on the verge of extinction. After they moved from the Lower and Middle to the Upper Xingu the process of decline in numbers was interrupted, and the present population seems to be at the replacement level.
Present-day Juruna live in an area near the Diauarum Post of the Xingu National Park, between latitude 10°55' south and longitude 53°20' west. When Galvâo (1952) visited them in 1950, they were grouped in a single village near the mouth of the Manitsauá river, on the left side of the Xingu. However, Simóes (1963) later observed a split into two villages, due to internal prob-

lems. A group, led by the Indian Daá, moved to a new location on the right bank of the Xingu, while the remainder of the tribe stayed in the same place, under the direction of another leader (Bibina). However, by 1967a large part of the splinter group had returned to their original location, with the exception of a single family of five persons, and there are indications that this family will also return to Bibina's village.

population. This is also reflected in theestimated average age.The Juruna show the lowest average age among thefemales (16), when compared with the Xavante (18), Yanomamö (21),and Caingang (23); and the second lowest frequency among the males (19, as compared with 17among the Xavante and 21 and 23 among the Yanomamö and Caingang respectively). Asfor the sex ratio, there is a slight predominance of males, as is true for the other series.

to the Juruna exogamous marriages, namely, the Kamayurá, Kayabi, Suya, Taconhapé, Trumai, and Xipáya. There were no preferences according to sex in these exogamous unions.In eleven such marriages involving ten individuals from outside, five were men and five women.

Despite the fact that there is some exogamy, the degree of inbreeding found among the endogamous Juruna is of such a nature that the average inbreeding coefficient is one of the highest thus far calculated for any human community. As can be seen in Table 4, this coefficient (0.022) is

more than four times larger than those cal-
culated for the Xavante and Caingang (0.004 and 0.005, respectively). This is due to the high percentage of multiple consanguinity observed in marriages among the Juruna. As a matter of fact, in one of these marriages the two spouses were connected by no less than eight different routes of con-
sanguinity. The inbreeding coefficient observed is a little higher than the one we would obtain if all spouses in this population were second cousins.

ably be true for the Juruna-Caingang comparison, if the number of mothers studied among the first group were larger.
It should be noted that after the age group 10-14 all Juruna women are or have been married. There are, however, two widows and one divorced woman who presently do not have husbands because the only prospective male available cannot marry either one of them. The two widows are daughters of his sisters, while the divorced woman is his own sister. No sterility was observed among the married women. Polygamy, once prevailing among the Juruna, is presently absent.
The mortality among the Juruna seems to be low for a population at this cultural level. We have been informed that of the 42 live births registered only four children had died at the time of the investigation (all before reproducing). Therefore, the average number of surviving offspring (2.9) is only 9% lower than the average number of live births (3.2). This compares favorably with the values observed among the Indians in the nineteenth century: Xingu, 62%; Kuikuro, 58%; Caingang, 38%; Xavante, 36%; Bororo, 30%; and Yanomamö, 16% (for references, see footnotes to Tables 2 and 5).
The breeding size of the Juruna population (number of actual progenitors) is 22, that is, 38% of the total population, and its effective size (Li, 1955) can be estimated as 12 (21% of the total). The relative proportions of these three parameters are of the same order of magnitude as the ones observed among the Xavante (Salzano, Neel, and Maybury-Lewis, 1967) and Caingang (Salzano, 1961, 1964).
DISCUSSION
Some significant features are appearing as data accumulate on the demography of groups that may be called "primitive"-- those who still obtain food by means that were prevalent in the early phase of human history, who present archaic cultural fea-

tures, and who are illiterate. Populations relying mainly on hunting and gathering, with incipient agriculture, can be characterized as follows: (a) Their genetic structure is of a fission-fusion type (Neel and Salzano, 1967); that is, the pattern is one of exchange carried out mainly by more or less large subgroups of the tribe, (b) Mortality and fertility are lower than among groups of agriculturalists, (c) There is a high marriage frequency and a low occurrence of sterility; with few exceptions every adult female must be regarded as a member of the reproducing population, (d) In tribes with polygamy there may be a disproportionate reproduction of a selected few, with a greater variance in the number of surviving offspring for males whose reproduction is completed than for similar females.
To what extent does the Juruna demography fit this pattern? Before answering this question, we must examine the history of this group. They have had contacts of different kinds with the frontier of the Brazilian civilization for more than a century now. The first consequences of this contact were disastrous and almost led to the extinction of the group. After they retreated to more inaccessible places, they were able to partially recover. But their culture does not seem to have suffered too much during the process; they still keep many of their traditional patterns, institutions, and beliefs (Oliveira, 1968). This explains why many features of their demography are still those of relatively "untouched" groups. Among these features we can mention their "moderate" mortality and fertility, high frequency of marriage and absence of sterility, and their relatively large exogamy index. Their high coefficient of inbreeding, however, may simply reflect the extreme reduction in size they suffered, accompanied by a desire to survive as an independent group. It is of some interest that the Emerillon and Wayana Indians of French Guiana, who also experienced an
