ABSTRACT:Data presented in this brief note show that one of the consequences of recent gains in the control of neonatal mortality has been an increase in the frequency of endogenous causes of death in the postneonatal period. This in turn has greatly diminished the validity of using the postneonatal death rate as a proxy for the level of exogenous mortality in infancy. Moreover, although there continues to be a very strong correlation between neonatal and endogenous mortality, the increasing dominance of the latter causes throughout infancy also weakens the value of the age-cause proxy relationship during the first month of life.

It has long been common practice for studies of mortality to distinguish between two broad classes of deaths-- those presumed to arise from genetic make-up or internal physiological developments (endogenous), and those whose origin is presumed to lie in external or environmental factors (exogenous) (Shryock et al., 1976, p. 232). The rationale for this distinction lies in the fact that the former causes are, with their biological basis, typically less responsive to scientific progress, whereas deaths attributed to the latter cause group, which result mainly from infection and accident, are more easily preventable and treatable.
With respect to infant mortality, this cause distinction has traditionally paralleled the division of deaths under one year of age into neonatal deaths (under one month, or 28 days) and postneonatal deaths (age 1 to 11 months). In fact, the neonatal-postneonatal split has often been used as a proxy for the endogenous-exogenous cause distinction (Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977; Markides and Barnes, 1977). However,

the validity of this traditional age-cause proxy relationship has been called into question. Bogue (1969, p. 588) has observed that endogenous causes dominate for only the first three or four days of infancy, after which exogenous causes are just as important as during the last eleven months. Although Bogue's data were not sufficiently detailed to define a more precise age cutoff for separating exogenous and endogenous causes, they suggest that the neonatal death rate as conventionally defined is not a good proxy for endogenous mortality.
More recently, Posten and Rogers (1985) analyzed the age/cause pattern of infant mortality on a day-by-day basis for deaths occurring under one year of age in New Mexico to infants born during the years 1974-77. They found that the endogenous and exogenous dayspecific death rates converged at about the 18th day, and they concluded that the use of either the neonatal or postneonatal mortality rates as proxies for endogenous and exogenous mortality rates is not warranted. They also sug-

gested that 18 rather than 28 days might be a better age-cause cutoff point for the infant mortality subdivision.
It is important to note that while the findings of Posten and Rogers disagree with Bogue's data in setting the length of the neonatal period, they are compatible in suggesting that it should be shortened. Based upon our experience in examining the age-cause proxy issue, however, we suggest that any argument for shortening the length of time defining the neonatal mortality rate is premature. Some of the results of our recently completed study of the socioeconomic correlates of infant mortality in metropolitan Ohio (Stockwell, et al., 1986) are pertinent to this debate.

tracts of eight Ohio cities were aggregated into five socioeconomic status areas on the basis of the percentage of families with a 1979 income of less than $10,000. The census tracts were aggregated in such a way that approximately 20 per cent of the urban tracts fell into each income area. For each of the income areas, 1979-81 infant mortality rates (total, neonatal, and postneonatal) were calculated for all deaths and for deaths due to the two major exogenous and endogenous categories (see

Table 1). The resulting infant death rates are presented in Table 2.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Several conclusions are readily apparent from the data presented here. First, with respect to total infant mortality, the vast majority of the deaths under one year of age today are caused by the endogenous conditions that are most closely associated with the physiological processes of gestation and births. In metropolitan Ohio for the three-year period 1979-81, 86 per cent of the deaths under one year of age were attributed to one or another of the endogenous causes. Second, both the exogenous and endogenous cause-specific death rates are inversely associated with family income status. Not surprisingly perhaps, the strength of the relationship, as measured by the difference between the death rates of the highest and lowest income areas, is much greater for the environmentally related exogenous causes. The Area V exogenous death rate is nearly five times greater than that in Area I; in contrast, the Area V endogenous death rate is only one and a half times as great as the corresponding Area I endogenous death rate. Further, there is an obvious tendency for the exogenous causes to account for an increasing proportion of total deaths as income status decreases, e.g., 8per cent of the infant deaths in Area I as compared to 17per cent in Area V were due to exogenous causes.
It is thus clear that despite the much lower absolute death rate, the increased risk of dying as economic status declines is relatively much greater for the environmentally related exogenous causes than it is for the endogenous causes. However, the fact that the inverse asso-

ciation between infant mortality and economic status is much more pronounced for those conditions that can generally be regarded as most amenable to societal control must not lead one to downplay the existence of a consistent and pronounced inverse relationship for those less resistant endogenous conditions that account for the vast majority of infant deaths.
With respect to the neonatal-postneonatal split, our data reveal that a pronounced inverse association exists between both cause groups and economic status for both the neonatal and postneonatal period. The more interesting point in the present context, however, is perhaps the challenge these data pose to the traditional distinction between neonatal/endogenous as opposed to postneonatal/exogenous mortality. With respect to this traditional practice of using the neonatal and postneonatal death rates as proxies for endogenous and exogenous mortality, our data would suggest that it is clearly no longer justified. Although there is a pronounced predominance of endogenous deaths in the neonatal period (93 per cent), our data also show a heavy majority of the postneonatal deaths attributed to these causes (73 per cent). This emerging dominance of the endogenous causes at the postneonatal as well as neonatal ages obviously invalidates the traditional age-cause proxy relationship.
The increasing incidence of endogenous causes in the postneonatal period is likely a reflection of the progress made in recent years in the ability to prolong the life of high-risk births, particularly low-birth-weight infants (McCormick, 1985). That is, many infants that a generation ago would have died within the
