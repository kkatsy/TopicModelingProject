ABSTRACT: From information on mortality of Jews obtained from individual death certificates and population data from surveys of the Jewish population undertaken in 1963 and 1987, age-specific death rates and life expectancy of the Jewish population of Rhode Island are compared with those of the total white population for 1963 and 1987 to assess changing differentials. The Jewish mortality experience continues to differ from that of the larger population even while both groups have experienced noticeable improvements. For males, the age standardized rates have widened in favor of Jews as have the life expectancies at birth and the percentage surviving to old age. By contrast, for females, the standardized death rate has widened considerably in favor of whites, while life expectancy has improved almost identically for both groups and therefore remained about equal, as it was in 1963. Reasons for these patterns are explored through attention to differences between Jews and the general white population in death rates at particular stages of the life cycle. Jews tend to be more advantaged at all but the most advanced ages, age groups in which proportionally more of the Jewish population and Jewish deaths are concentrated.

The changing importance of religious identity as a variable in fertility differentials in the United States (Freedman et al., 1959; Westoff et al., 1961; DellaPergola, 1980; Goldscheider and Mosher, 1988; Goldscheider, 1993) has been well documented despite the absence of a question on religion both in the United States census and on the standard birth records of the varied states. Such assessments of religious differentials in fertility have been made possible by a series of national surveys in which questions on religious identity allow measurement, for the varied religious groups, of both the population at risk of childbearing and actual fertility experience. Parallel sets of survey data on mortality are difficult to develop; the disproportional number of deaths occurring to older persons means that many deceased do not leave behind other household members to report

their deaths in a conventional household survey (cf. Sirken et al., 1977). Therefore, deceased persons who had lived alone and many of those in institutions would most likely not be identified in such a survey. As a result, neither the appropriate base population nor the religious identity of the deceased can be fully or correctly obtained through conventional surveys similar to those used in fertility research.
Nonetheless, interest in factors affecting health and mortality and their implications for changing population size and composition argue for attention to the impact of religious identity in addition to such factors as age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Moreover, to the extent that religious identity is correlated with differential life styles that affect health and longevity and that high rates of religious endogamy result in genetic conditions associated

with higher or lower survival rates, religious differentials in mortality become an important perspective for understanding changes in mortality levels and life expectancy in the larger society. This report, based on data for a single state, Rhode Island, explores the patterns of Jewish mortality and survival during 1985-89, the ways these differ from those of the general white population, and the ways these differences have changed in the quarter century since 1962-64 when a similar assessment (Goldstein, 1966) was undertaken for approximately the same area, using the same types of data.
The observances of health measures and cleanliness prescribed by traditional Judaism (Fishberg, 1911), coupled with the higher-than-average socioeconomic status of the Jewish population (Goldstein, 1992) would lead one to expect the Jewish group to have lower mortality rates and longer survival than the general population. However, such an hypothesized differential may be mitigated, if not totally eliminated, as a result of both the general improvement in health standards and a rise in the socioeconomic status of the population at large. By comparing the mortality experience of the Jewish and the total white populations and assessing change in this relation over approximately 25 years, this analysis is designed to gain insights into the extent to which the religious dimension constitutes an important variable in mortality differentials in America as we approach the end of the twentieth century.
For reasons cited above, any comprehensive analysis of mortality must begin with records that provide the

maximum opportunity for identifying all deceased regardless of their household or family status at the time of death. Official death certificates provide the best means for doing so. However, because vital statistics records do not contain information on religion, indirect information that provides clues to the religious identification of the deceased must be used before death certificate information can be used for the analysis of religious differentials in mortality. And even if such indirect data prove useful in identifying the religion of the deceased, the need for calculating death rates and survival functions raises the challenges of identifying the appropriate population at risk.
Among the clues that have been used to identify the religion of the deceased are the place of burial of the deceased and the particular funeral establishment that handled the funeral. The value of these particular sources of information probably varies by religious identity, largely reflecting the different practices with respect to burial in cemeteries identified as Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, or nonsectarian. A similar concern extends to whether funerals are largely handled by funeral directors of the same religious denomination as the deceased. For Jews, the evidence seems strong that this is the case.
PAST STUDIES OF JEWISH MORTALITY
Studies undertaken of Jewish deaths in New York City during 1949-51 (Seidman et al., 1962) and in St. Louis during 1955-57 (Gorwitz, 1962) indicated, for example, that a very large proportion of Jewish funerals were handled

74

by a restricted number of funeral directors and that most Jewish burials took place in a Jewish cemetery. Nonetheless, problems in using burial site as the basis for identifying religion of deceased exist. In New York, 20 per cent of the total New York deaths had to be regarded as of unspecified religion because the bodies were either cremated, interred out of town, or buried in the city cemetery. Random assignment of religion in the same proportion as deceased with known religion weakens the value of the data for purposes of a study of religious differentials in mortality. The use by the St. Louis study of information on both the funeral director and the place of burial enhanced the likelihood that the resulting statistics correctly reflected total Jewish deaths.
Nonetheless, in both New York and St. Louis, the absence of information on the Jewish population among whom the deaths occurred and especially on its age/sex composition seriously limited the usefulness of the data on deaths for calculating death and survival rates. Since age composition in particular is a major variable in accounting for differentials in overall levels of mortality, information on agespecific death rates is essential if the mortality experience of the Jewish and non-Jewish populations are to be compared.
Within these data limitations, the St. Louis study (Gorwitz, 1962), relying on estimates of the size of the total Jewish population, found that the Jewish mortality rate was approximately 14 per cent lower than that of the resident white population of the area. A much higher percentage of Jewish deaths than of white deaths were concentrated

between ages 45 and 85, but this finding may have reflected nothing more than differences in age composition of the two populations. In the absence of proper data on the base population, no definitive conclusions about differentials in risk of mortality were feasible.
The New York study (Seidman et al., 1962) tried to overcome some of the limitations of the St. Louis study by using least squares method to estimate the Jewish and non-Jewish white populations and death rates by age, sex, and socioeconomic class. It found that the male Jewish death rate was 14 per cent below that of non-Jewish white males whereas the Jewish female rate was 4 per cent greater than that of nonJewish white females. It also found that the Jewish death rates were much lower for Jewish than for non-Jewish persons in the same age, sex, and socioeconomic class in the younger age groups, but that this advantage diminished and was even reversed in certain of the older groups. Within the Jewish group itself, the death rates of those in the upper and middle socioeconomic groups were lower than those in the low socioeconomic class. Although direct comparison of the St. Louis and New York findings is not possible, in general, the conclusions pointed in the same direction, that is, an overall lower mortality for Jews.
Such a conclusion supports an earlier finding of Mortimer Spiegelman (1948), based on Canadian data which, unlike the United States, provided information on religion from both the census and vital statistics. For 1940-42, Spiegelman found that the life expectancy of Jews exceeded that of the general population by 4.6 years for males and 3.6 years for females. Like the

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

later New York study, the Canadian investigation also found that the differentials favoring the Jews decreased with advancing age; life expectancy of Jewish males and of the total Canadian population became equal at about age 25 and that of females at about age 35. Beyond age 50, Jews began to be characterized by higher mortality rates. Without further controls for differences in place of residence, socioeconomic status, nativity, and marital status, as well as cause of death, the exact reason for the observed differences between Jews and non-Jews cannot be definitively explained.
The limitations inherent in the small number of studies conducted in the 1940's and 1950's stimulated the author to take advantage of a unique combination of data for Providence, Rhode Island, to undertake an assessment of Jewish mortality and survival patterns in the period 1962-64 (Goldstein, 1966). A population survey, completed for the Jewish population of Greater Providence in 1963, encompassed the cities of Providence and Pawtucket and nearby suburban areas (for details, see Goldstein, 1964). Based on an updated master list of Jewish residents of the area, evaluated to be about 97 per cent complete, a 25 per cent sample of the all Jewish households in the community was surveyed, yielding 1,420 completed interviews, representing a response rate of 91.3 per cent. The completed sample was weighted to represent the full universe of Jews residing in the Greater Providence area. Since the survey collected information on age and sex of all household members, it yielded for 1963 information on the base population, categorized by age and sex, at risk of dying in and around

1963. The challenge was to identify the deaths occurring to this population.
The Jewish community of Greater Providence was so structured that almost all deaths occurring to Jews were handled by a single funeral director. Moreover, practically all Jewish deceased were buried in the two cemeteries serving the area encompassed by the study. Finally, even the very small number of Jewish deceased who were cremated or buried in other cemeteries were generally serviced through the one Jewish funeral home that existed at the time. All of the available evidence indicated that reliance on the records of the Jewish funeral establishment provided virtually 100 per cent coverage for all deaths occurring among Jews residing in Greater Providence, even if their deaths occurred elsewhere.
For purposes of the mortality study, the list of names of all deceased for the period August 1,1962 through July 31, 1964, a period centered on the months during which the population survey was completed, was obtained from the funeral establishment. Each name on this list was, in turn, checked in the files of the Rhode Island Division of Vital Statistics. After matching with the original death certificate, information on age, sex, and cause of death was abstracted. In conjunction with the age/sex data from the sample survey, this information from the vital records provided the basis for calculating age/ sex specific death rates, for constructing life tables, and for assessing cause of death. Comparable statistics and life tables available for the mortality experience during 1959-61 of the general population allowed comparative assessment of the mortality patterns of Jews and the total white population of

Rhode Island. Integrated use of the population survey statistics and the data on Jewish mortality in Greater Providence thus overcame the major limitations inherent in earlier efforts to assess Jewish mortality. Since the data of the 1962-64 Providence study will be used in conjunction with later evaluation of Jewish mortality patterns in Rhode Island in 1985-89 to assess changes over the intervening quarter century, the findings of the 1962-64 study will not be reviewed at this point.
Between the 1962-64 analysis and this analysis of the 1985-89 mortality patterns of Rhode Island Jewry, Alice Goldstein (1986) analyzed the causes of death among Rhode Island Jews in 1979-81. Deaths were identified through a combination of obituary listings in the local Jewish press and listings provided by local institutions, such as funeral homes and synagogues. The 735 deaths occurring in the three-year period were matched with death certificates to obtain information on the characteristics of the deceased and their cause of death. The absence of information on the population at risk precluded calculation of either age/sex specific death rates or life tables. The findingsindicated that relatively fewer Jewish males died at ages below 65 and more at ages 85 and over than was true of total white males. On the other hand, Jewish females exhibited an ageat-death pattern more similar to white females. The absence of information on the age structure of the Jewish population precluded determination of whether these patterns reflected actual differences in mortality experience or differences attributable to variations in the age composition of the respective populations.

Several studies of Jewish mortality undertaken in other settings and using other types of data warrant brief attention. Again taking advantage of questions on religion in the Canadian census and vital statistics, Lionel Needleman (1988) calculated a series of life tables for the Jewish population of the city of Montreal centered on the census years of 1921,1931,1941,1951, 1961, and 1971. These successive life tables allowed evaluation of both trends in Jewish mortality experience over fifty years and changes in patterns of differentials between Jews and the Canadian population as a whole. Needleman's analysis showed that for the first thirty years of the period, very low mortality characterized the Jewish population up to early middle age and relatively high mortality thereafter. By the end of the 1960's, however, the "Jewish" pattern of mortality had disappeared. The expectation of life of female Jews was similar to that of all Canadian women, but that of males was higher than that of Canadian men.
Unfortunately, the continuing unavailability of comparable official data sources for the United States means that one has to rely on alternative data sets to identify Jewish deaths and the population at risk. Rosenwaike and Hempstead (1989; 1990) evaluated differential mortality among foreign-born Irish, Italians, and Jews in New York City during 1979-81, focusing largely on mortality by cause among deaths to persons age 45-84. For the Irish and Italians, age specific rates could be calculated using ethnicity data on the death certificate and census data on the foreign-born. In the absence of information on religion in both data sets, for Jews the investigators had to rely on

religious denomination of cemetery of burial to identify the religion of the deceased and on proportional mortality analysis in lieu of information on the base Jewish population. The latter involved comparisons of deaths among the Jewish population with that of a standard population to ascertain excesses and deficits of death by cause. The results suggest that the Jewish and Italian groups have cause-of-death distributions relatively similar to each other but dissimilar from the Irish, reflecting the impact of alcohol relateddeaths among the Irish.
Rosenwaike's interest in the mortality of Jews led to a very innovative analysis, also for 1979-81, but focusing exclusively on elderly Jews. Intrigued by the evidence from earlier studies of lower than average Jewish mortality levels at younger ages and higher averages at older ages, and challenged by the absence of direct data on Jewish deaths and on the population at risk, Rosenwaike (1990) used 22 distinctive Jewish names to identify 117,163 Medicare enrollees on April 1,1980 as likely to be Jewish. These names constituted the base population. He then used these same surnames to identify 17,819 Jewish deaths during 1979-81. The resulting age-specific rates among the 65year-and-over enrollees in Medicare showed that Jewish men had substantially lower death rates than those for all whites at ages 65-69, but the differential diminished with each advance in age until by age 85 and over the mortality of the Jewish males exceeded that of the whites. For women, he found that the advantage of Jews over whites was substantial among the younger elderly and disappeared after age-group 75-79. Although limited to

mortality among the aged, these findings are important since a vast majority of all deaths occurs among those 65 years and over (for example, in Rhode Island about 80 per cent for males and 85 per cent for females). Nonetheless, one would prefer to have data that encompass the entire age range.
Rosenwaike (1994) also used the national rates calculated for American Jews on the basis of the Medicare records to evaluate causes of death among New York City's Jewish elderly in 1979-81. In the absence of access to base population data for New York City's Jews, he applied the age/sexspecific death rates calculated for all American Jews to data on cause of death obtained from 36,303 certificates of deceased buried in Jewish cemeteries in the three years centered on 1980. The rate for each cause was ascertained by the percentage of deaths due to the cause in each age/sex category. The resulting estimates of causespecific rates were found to be consistent with data from previous studies.
The need to improvise in obtaining cause-specific rates and age/sex specific rates in this and other studies of Jewish mortality in the United States highlights the desirability of utilizing afirm population base for measuring the risk of dying and for being able to do so for the full population rather than just the elderly. Such an opportunity to do so, paralleling the use of the 1963 population survey of the Jewish population of Greater Providence, emerged with the completion of a second survey of Rhode Island Jewry in 1987. The data from that survey, used in conjunction with information on Jewish deaths, forms the basis for this research. In using these data, comparisons with the

78

patterns observed for 1962-64 allow assessment of both changes in the Jewish mortality experience over a quarter century and how similar these changes were to those in the white population of the state.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA SOURCES
The Jewish Federation of Rhode Island undertook a second survey of the Jewish population in 1987 (Goldscheider and Goldstein, 1988). While the 1963 survey was restricted to Greater Providence, the 1987 survey encompassed the entire state of Rhode Island, reflecting the residential dispersion of Rhode Island Jewry into the outer suburbs and southern parts of the state. In 1987, approximately three-quarters of the sample households were selected through a random sample chosen from the lists of the Jewish Federation of Rhode Island, which after updating, contained approximately 6,600 households. The remaining one-quarter came from a sample generated by random digit dialing (RDD) of all households with telephones in Rhode Island. In total, 18,000 households in the state were contacted and screened to identify those households containing Jewish members which would serve to supplement the sample from the Federation list. About 91 per cent of the RDD sample was on the Federation list, attesting to its higher level of completeness. For the 9 per cent who were not on the list, the RDD sample served to ensure coverage of Jewish households more marginal to the organized community.

In each household in both the list and the RDD samples, one person who was aged 21 and over (or aged 18 to 20 if no member of the household was 21 or older) was randomly selected to be the respondent, providing information about himself/herself and about all members of the household. A total of 1,455 households were contacted for interviews and 1,129 completed interviews were obtained, a response rate of 78 per cent. These data were weighted to approximate the total Jewish population of Rhode Island. The weighted data, representing 15,520 persons identified as Jewish at the time of the survey, are used in this analysis to provide statistics on the base Jewish population subject to the risk of dying around 1987. The availability from the survey of information on the age and sex of each household member allows subdivision of the total population into appropriate age/sex categories for purposes of calculating age/sex specific death rates and life table survival functions.
The 1963 and 1987 surveys covered different areas, the latter encompassing the entire state and the former only Greater Providence. This difference introduces some noncomparability between the two data sets, but not any that seriously interferes with their joint use to assess changes over the intervening quarter century. First, there is considerable overlap in coverage; 89 per cent of the 1987 population lived in the area covered by the 1963 survey. Second, there is no reason to believe that the socioeconomic characteristics of the 11 per cent residing in the outer areas in 1987 are substantially different from the population covered in 1963 since the earlier sample did encompass

suburban areas also. Third, since virtually all of the analyses control for age and sex, comparisons between the two data sets are not seriously affected by differences in age/sex composition of the broader areal coverage in 1987.
As in 1962-64, the information on deaths was obtained from the funeral homes that service the vast majority of the state's Jewish community; by 1987 two such establishments existed. As part of a larger project focussing on an assessment of where deaths occurred (home, hospital, Jewish Home for the Aged, or nursing home), a complete list of deaths of Jewish residents of Rhode Island, covering the period 1953-89, was obtained from the two Jewish funeral homes. A very small number of deaths occurring to residents in the southern part of the state, probably no more than 10 per year, were not covered, but their omission is not considered serious. All of the available evidence suggests that reliance upon the records of the two funeral homes provides close to 100 per cent coverage for all Jewish deaths which occurred in the state.
For each deceased, information was abstracted from the death certificates on name, year of birth (age), sex, marital status, occupation, place of birth, residence at time of death, and place of death. This analysis uses the information on the age and sex characteristics of those who died during 1985-89, which is centered on the 1987 survey, to obtain age/sex specific death rates and to use these to construct life tables of the Rhode Island Jewish population. The five-year interval is used to increase the number of cases and thereby insure greater stability of the rates, especially because in younger years the

number of Jewish deaths is very small. A total of 1,170 deaths were enumerated for the five-year period, 556 males and 614 females. In calculating rates, a five-year average was employed.
To permit comparison with the mortality experience of the general population, the age and sex specific death rates and life tables for the white population of the state in 1989-91 are used. The absence of census data on the state's population by age, sex, and race for 1987 precluded calculation of rates for the same year as the survey was taken. The age specific death rates and life tables for 1989-91 were constructed using data on age/sex/race specific deaths from state vital statistics tabulations for 1989, 1990, and 1991 and the 1990 white population by age and sex enumerated by the 1990 federal census. Use of the 1989-91 data for whites means that their death rates may be somewhat lower and their life expectancy somewhat higher than if the 1987 rates had been available because of improvements in mortality that occurred during 1988-91. The difference between 1987 and 1989-91 rates are not, however, likely to be large; between 1980 and 1990 the life expectancy at birth of white Rhode Island males increased by only 0.6 years and that of females by only 1.3 years, or an annual average of only 0.06 and 0.13 years respectively. This finding suggests that in 1987, compared to the 1989-91 life tables being used for comparative purposes, the life expectancy of white females was at most half a year lower and even less so for males. This small differential minimizes the need for concern about the use of the later life table values for whites in the comparative evaluation with Jews in 1987.

RESULTS
Between 1963 and 1987 the Rhode Island Jewish population had aged considerably as a result of age-selective out-migration and low fertility. In 1963, the median age of Jewish males was 34.4 years and that of females 37.4 years; by 1987, the median ages of males and females were 44.5 and 47.8 years respectively, an increase of about 10 years over the 25-year period (Table 1). During approximately this same interval, the state's white population had also aged, but not as sharply as did the Jews; the male median rose from 29.2 to 33.4 years and the female median from 34.7 to 36.7 years. Higher outmigration of younger Jews, associated with the very high proportion who leave the state to obtain a college/ university education and then remain outside the state to pursue a career, coupled with lower Jewish than white fertility accounts for the differences. These factors are evidenced in the age distribution data which show fewer Jews in ages 0-14 and especially in ages 15-34, which encompass the college/ university years and periods associated with beginning a career. By contrast, in 1987, 23 per cent of Jewish males and 26 per cent of all Jewish females were age 65 and over, compared to only 13 per cent of white males and 19 per cent of white females in 1990. The differences in age composition argue strongly for control for age in any comparisons, both over time and between the Jewish and the white populations.
In 1963, the crude death rate among Jewish males was 10.6 per 1,000 population, slightly below the white male rate of 11.3 (Table 2). Once age was controlled, however, through age stan-

dardization,1 the Jewish rate rose to 11.0, still below but closer to that of whites, suggesting that about half the 0.7 difference in crude rates was attributable to age composition and that overall Jewish and white male mortality experience varied minimally. For females, the pattern was quite different. The 9.7 per 1,000 crude death rate of Jewish females was slightly higher than the 9.4 rate for white females, but standardization raised the Jewish rate to 11.2, accentuating the Jewish-white difference.
For 1987, quite a different set of relations emerges. The crude Jewish male rate of 15.0 is almost 50 per cent greater than that of the white males at 10.2. However, this differential is attributable to the much older age composition of Jewish males (an average of 11 years). With age controlled, the low Jewish death rate of 8.6 per 1,000 is only 82 per cent as high as the white male rate, suggesting that over the quarter century Jewish mortality improved to a much greater extent than did white mortality generally. The Jewish female crude rate was quite similar to that of the Jewish males, while that of white females was slightly lower than the rate for white males. Control for age reduces the Jewish female rate, bringing it down to 12.2 per 1,000, compared to the 9.8 rate for white females, but this is still a 25 per cent excess for the Jewish families.
Compared to 1963, when Jewish female mortality exceeded that of white
1Age standardization eliminates the extraneous source of variation among groups due to differences in age composition. It indicates what the Jewish death rates would be if Jews had the same age composition as whites but retained their own agespecific death rates (Shryock et al., 1976, p. 164-165 and 179-180).

tionally more physically impaired Jews may live until the upper older ages when the chronic conditions take a heavier toll (Spiegelman, 1948, p. 300301).
By 1987, the pattern of differentials seems to have changed. Except for infants for whom the Jewish rate was slightly above that of white babies, Jewish male mortality levels were below those of white males at all ages through 75-84 years; the rate for this group was 35 per cent greater among whites than among Jewish males. Except for infants, only among those age 85 and over did the rate of Jewish male deaths exceed that of all whites in the same age group, and for this group it did so by a wide margin, 57 per cent. The much wider age range over which lower Jewish male mortality extended in 1987 helps explain the substantially lower standardized rate for total Jewish males, 8.6 per 1,000 compared to 10.2 for white males.
Clearly, between 1963 and 1987, a much greater improvement in survival characterized the Jewish than the white male segment of the population. For example, for those age 65-74 and 7584, the 1987 Jewish death rate was less than half that of Jewish males in these age groups in 1963, whereas for white males the decline was only 36 per cent for those age 65-74 and 26 per cent for the 75-84 year group. These differential rates of change in mortality may reflect variations in the socioeconomic composition of the Jewish and the white populations, leading to whites having poorer access to health care and survival experience, even though conditions for both have improved over the several decades covered by the comparisons.

Only in the very oldest group, those age 85 and over, among whom Jewish mortality far exceeded that of white males, did the age-specific rates of the Jews and the whites decline at approximately the same rate, 27 per cent for the Jews and 24 per cent for the whites. As recent research (Kannisto et al., 1994) documenting substantial reductions in mortality at advanced ages in developed countries suggests, since half of female deaths and a third of male deaths in such countries now occur at age 80 and above, mortality reductions in these older ages can significantly affect life expectancy and the proportion of aged in the population. For Rhode Island Jews, the percentages were even higher, about 60 per cent of all deaths of females and 45 per cent of all male deaths occurred to persons age 80 and over, helping to explain the impact of deaths in old age on the overall mortality levels of Jews.
For females, too, the age-specific rates of Jews showed more dramatic improvement than for whites and resulted in the Jewish rates being lower than those of white females to older ages than was true in 1963. If one overlooks some inconsistencies within ages 1-34 where the death rates of both Jewish and white females are very low (under 1.0 per 1,000), the age-specific rates of Jewish females in 1987 are below those of white females generally in every age group through 65-74, 10 years earlier than for males but 20 years later than the point at which the cross-over occurred in 1963 for females. Between ages 65 and 74, the difference is not great, though favoring Jewish women. For those age 75-84, Jewish mortality exceeds that of white females by only 19 per cent, but for the

84

85 and over group the disadvantage characterizing Jewish women increases to 68 per cent.
For both Jewish and white females above age 55, as for comparable age groups of males, the improvements in mortality were substantial. However, the degree of change in relation to age followed a different pattern for men and women. The relative difference between the 1963 and the 1987 rates decreased with rising age for Jewish women from a 64 per cent decline for those age 55-64 to only a 28 per cent decline for the oldest. For whites, the decrease between 1960 and 1990 in the death rates of those age 55-64 was only 26 per cent, but with successive age groups this percentage rose, reaching a 45 per cent decline in the rate for those age 75-84. For the oldest group, however, the rate of change was lower, only 31 per cent. Reflecting these different patterns of change, Jewish women between ages 55-74 were characterized by greater improvement than white women in these ages. By contrast, those age 75 and over experienced lower reductions than whites in general. It is the more moderate decreases at ages 75 and over, where most of the deaths occur, that accounts for the higher age standardized rate of Jewish mortality (12.2) compared to white mortality (9.8) in 1987 and the increase in the differential between the two groups from 1.8 per 1,000 in 1963 to 2.4 per 1,000 in 1987.
What might explain the changing relation between Jewish and white agespecific rates and the greater improvement overall in male Jewish mortality compared to that of white males, and the different pattern for females? Without fuller attention to the impact on mortality of a host of other socio-

economic characteristics, such as education, income, marital status, and use of health facilities, one can only speculate. Part of the explanation may lie in the change over the quarter century in the nativity status of the Jewish and the total white population. In 1963,17 per cent of all Jews in Greater Providence were foreign-born. Associated with this were higher proportions with lower educational achievement and lower occupational status, characteristics often associated with more limited access to health facilities and poorer overall health. The Jews in the early 1960's were living under more favorable conditions than the general population, even though the latter had fewer immigrants (10 per cent). In ensuing decades, the reduction in foreign-born was greater for the Jews, about half, from 17 per cent in 1963 to 9 per cent in 1987, compared to a decline of only about one-third for whites, from 10 per cent in 1960 to 7 per cent in 1990, reflecting the higher rate of recent immigration for the larger white community. The reductions in the proportion of immigrants among the elderly was even greater, from 73 per cent to 17per cent for Jews and from 41 to 11 per cent for whites, but for both the total and the elderly population, Jews continued to have more immigrants.
Moreover, the rise of Jews in the educational and occupational hierarchy was more substantial. In 1963, 41 per cent of adult Jews had at least a college education (48 per cent of men and 35 per cent of women); by 1987 this was true of three-fourths of the adult Jewish population (79 per cent of men and 68 per cent of women). By contrast, the proportion of adult whites with some college education increased from

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

only 13 per cent (15 per cent of men and 11 per cent of women) to 40 per cent (45 per cent of men and 37 per cent of women). Although the improvement for both white men and women by 1990 was relatively greater than for Jews, the absolute changes were less and brought each white gender group only slightly above the educational levels that had characterized Jews in 1963.
As Rogot et al. (1988, Table 6) have shown, higher education is a key variable associated with lower mortality. Using standard mortality ratios as a measure of comparative mortality, they found, for example, that in 197981 the expected mortality level of white males age 55-64 with a 0-4 level of education was 31 per cent greater than would be expected on the basis of all white males in this age group; by contrast that of college educated males ranged between 15 and 42 per cent lower than expected, being greatest for those with the most years of college completed. The same pattern generally held for women and for younger and older groups of both sexes. As Kunst and Mackenbach (1994) suggest, higher death rates of lower educated groups are explained at least in part by a higher prevalence of risk factors for disease, such as those related to lifestyles, material well-being, working conditions, and ways of coping with stress. They found that the effect of education on mortality is approximately equally large in all nine industrialized countries they compared.
Whatever factors underlay these educational differentials in the general population may also help to explain the differences between the mortality levels of Jewish males and the larger white population and changes in these rela-

tions between 1963 and 1987 in Rhode Island. They do not, however, offer a full answer, as evidenced by the differential rates of improvement characterizing men and women.
Age could certainly be a factor. The very oldest age groups contain the majority of immigrants, who generally have less education. Moreover this age group was not as affected by the sharp increases in education between the 1960's and late 1980's as the younger groups. It is among the groups under age 75 that the female Jewish death rates in 1985-89 are somewhat lower than the white female rates in 1990. In 1963 they were lower only through ages 45-54. The much higher average educational levels of the Jewish women by 1987, especially in younger age groups (among those age 25-44,84 per cent had some college education and for those age 45-64 about 72 per cent did, compared to only 44 per cent among those age 65 and over), may be indicative of the changes in basic life styles that led to the improvements noted earlier.
That the high levels of educational achievement among Jewish women are not associated with substantially lower mortality and better survival rates may be because women do not benefit as much from having a college and university education. Pappas et al. (1993), for example, found in their assessment of data from the 1986 National Mortality Followback Survey that the ageadjusted mortality ratio for white men with less than a high-school education was 2.5 times as great as for men with four or more years of college. By contrast, the ratio for the less educated women was 86 per cent. For men, higher education evidently yields a greater return, not only in earnings,

86

but also in style of life conducive to greater longevity. If so, this may help explain the wider differentials characterizing Jewish and white men compared to Jewish and white women.
In speculating about reasons for these patterns, we must also consider the possible role of selective out- and in-migration, especially of older persons. It is quite possible, for example, that Jewish retirees who move to the Sunbelt are more robust than those who stay behind to be cared for by relatives or friends or in nursing homes. Compounding such health-related outmigration of the elderly may be selective return and in-migration. Once confronted with health problems, especially after one spouse has died, older out-migrants may return to origin to be nearer relatives and friends who can care for them as their health deteriorates. Aged parents of Rhode Island residents may also move to the state, even though they did not live in it previously, to spend their remaining years close to their children. Together, these selective movements--in, out, and return--may inflate the death rates of aged Jews and help explain the differentials between them and the white elderly.
LIFE EXPECTANCY DIFFERENTIALS
Based on the age-specific death rates calculated for the Jewish population for 1963 and 1987, life tables were constructed to allow (1) evaluation of changes in Jewish life expectancy at different ages and (2) comparison of the Jewish patterns of change with those of the white population, using 1959-61 and 1989-91 life tables for the latter (Table 3).

In 1963, the life expectancy at birth of Jewish males, assuming continuation of the age-specific mortality characterizing the 1962-64 period, was 70.8 years. Reflecting their generally lower death rates, females could expect to live longer on average, to 73.4 years. Compared to the life expectancies of the white population, based on the mortality experience during the census-centered years 1959-61, Jewish males on the average could expect to live 3.3 years longer than males in the white population. By contrast, the differential for females was minimal and favored the white population; Jewish female life expectancy was 0.2 years lower than that of white females. These differentials parallel the pattern of differentials in age-specific death rates by age noted earlier.
Jewish females, like white females generally, enjoyed a longer life expectancy than did their male counterparts. However, the differential between men and women was greater for whites than for the Jewish segment of the population, 6.1 years compared to only 2.6 years, largely reflecting the much greater advantage in life expectancy that Jewish males had over white males.
By 1987, the life expectancy of Jews had risen considerably over its level a quarter century earlier. At birth, Jewish males could expect to live on average to 76.3 years and Jewish females to 79.3 years, gains of 5.5 and 5.9 years respectively, or about 8 per cent. Between 1959-61 and 1989-91, the 30year period over which changes in white life expectancy can be measured, life expectancy also rose, to 73.0 years for males and 79.8 years for females, representing gains of 5.5 years and 6.2

Beginning at age 65, white male expectancy was greater than that of Jewish males, and this advantage persisted into the very aged years. In fact, by age 85, white males could expect to live 2.0 years beyond the 2.6 years expected by Jewish males. The higher life expectancy of Jewish males at birth stems from the more favorable age-specific mortality patterns characterizing the younger age groups of the Jewish population. The advantage was lost at older ages due to their higher agespecific death rates at the later stages of the life cycle.
For females the pattern for 1963 was quite different. The slightly lower life expectancy characterizing Jewish females at birth was paralleled by lower life expectancy at all subsequent ages, and the disadvantage increased. Until age 35, the differential never exceeded one year, but at age 35 it was 1.1 years and with one exception it was greater at older ages, peaking at a difference of two years at age 85. Evidently the small advantages Jewish females enjoyed in age-specific mortality rates in most young and middle age groups were not great enough to offset the substantially higher death rates, compared to whites, that they experienced at 75 and over. As a result, Jewish females had lower life expectancy than white females at birth and throughout the life cycle. The factors accounting for this difference between Jewish males and females can not be determined from the data available for the 1962-64 deaths.
By 1987, the favorable life expectancy of Jewish males, in comparison to white males, extended 20 years further into the life cycle than was true in 1963 up to age 85. At age 55, for ex-

ample, the 24.1 years that Jewish males could still expect to live exceeded the expectancy of white males by 1.6 years and at age 75 the differential still favored Jews, although down to only 0.2 years. Only at age 85 did the Jewish male expectancy (3.6 years) go below that of white males (5.7 years), about equal in absolute terms to the 2.0 year difference of 1963. Overall, however, the data on life expectancy differentials for the males support the earlier finding that by 1987, compared to 1963, Jewish male survival had generally improved more than that of white males.
The lower 1963 life expectancy at birth of Jewish females compared to whites continued to 1987. Moreover, as in 1963, this disadvantage continued to hold for all ages. The comparative differences for Jewish and white females in 1987 changed minimally for younger groups. As in 1963, however, the relative difference between Jews and whites rose with increasing age from age 15 on. Yet, in the 1980's the differences were less sharp for age groups 5-74 than in the 1960's, especially for those age 35-64. For those age 75-84, however, the difference was considerably greater, while minimum change characterized the difference for the oldest group. For example, at age 45, in the 1980's life expectancies were 36.0 years for Jews and 36.6 years for whites, more similar than the 30.3 years and 31.7 years in the 1960's. Thereafter, the differential between white and Jewish women increased with rising age; at age 75, Jewish women in 1987 could expect to live 10.2 more years, whereas white women had an average expectancy of 12.5 years; this compared to expectancies of 8.0 and 9.0 respectively in the 1960's, a

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

difference considerably below that of the 1980's. At the oldest age, the comparative differences between 1963 and 1987 remained virtually unchanged, reflectingsimilar improvements for both Jewish and white females.
Compared to the 1960's, by the 1980's the percentage difference between Jewish and white male life expectancies, in contrast to those of females, had changed far more at all ages but the two oldest. The changes in life expectancy at all ages from 1 through 55 years widened the favorable Jewish male differential. For those age 75-84, the change resulted in a switch from a more favorable white life expectancy to a more favorable Jewish one. At 85, the change narrowed the continuing advantage whites had. By contrast, the changes for Jewish females compared to white females narrowed their unfavorable differentials for ages 5 through 65, but widened the differences at age 75 and resulted in little change at age 85. Evidently, whatever socioeconomic, behavioral, and/or biological factors were operating to improve the survival potential of Jewish males over this quarter century did not apply equally to the female segment of the Jewish population, especially not to those age 75 and over.
SURVIVAL EXPERIENCE
Average life expectancy at birth or at other specific ages reflects the mortality experience of the population throughout all later stages of the life cycle. A different perspective for evaluating the survival experience of the populations under study, also based on the life table, is to compare what proportion of the original birth cohort in

the varied groups will still be alive by any subsequent year of age.
The life tables constructed for the Jewish population of Greater Providence, based on age-specific death rates operating during 1962-64 showed that, if those mortality rates persisted, 95.5 per cent of all Jewish males would still be alive at age 45 compared to 92.4 per cent of all white males (Table 4). Reflecting the lower death rates at younger ages, by age 65, 76.8 per cent of the Jewish males but only 66.4 per cent of all white males in the original cohorts would still be living. Thereafter, the differential first narrows and then reverses itself; by age 85, only
10.1 per cent of the Jewish males but 18.2 per cent of all white males would still be living.
Reflecting the reductions in agespecific mortality that characterized the interval between the 1960's and the 1980's, the chances of surviving generally improved for both Jewish and white males. Based on the survival values for the 1985-89 period, 96.1 per cent of Jewish babies could expect to live until age 45, and this was true of 93.7 per cent of all white births. The comparatively small differential characterizing the two groups in the 1960's narrowed slightly, reflecting the small changes in the already low death rates characterizing most age groups under age 45.
By age 65, however, the improvements in survival chances were sharper, reflecting the much more substantial improvements in death rates between ages 45 and 65 among both Jews and whites generally. The survival rates of the 1980's show that out of the original cohorts, 84.1 per cent of Jewish males and 76.7 per cent of all

(94.8 per cent) were expected to survive to age 45. This differential was even smaller than for males. By age 65, again more Jewish than white females were expected to be still alive, but for females the differential, 1.8 percentage points, was minimal compared to the 10.4 percentage points favoring Jewish males at this age. Beyond age 65, higher proportions of white women than of Jewish women expected to survive; 23.7 per cent of all whites were expected to be still alive at age 85 compared to 19.7 per cent of the Jewish women.
How do the 1985-89 patterns of survival for females compare with those of 1962-64? As for men, there was improvement in survival chances, but most of the increase occurred in older ages. By age 45, 97.2 per cent of the Jewish female babies in the original cohort would still be alive if 1985-89 age-specific mortality levels continued throughout their lifetime, a survival rate only slightly higher than the 96.9 per cent characterizing white females as a whole. For Jews, the 1985-89 proportion surviving to age 45 represented a very small increase over the 96.9 per cent surviving to this age according to the 1962-64 rates; for whites, the improvement was slightly greater, from 94.8 per cent to 96.6 per cent. By age 65, however, the survival chances of both groups had improved substantially; 90.6 per cent of the Jewish females would still be alive compared to 82.2 per cent in the 1960's, and 86.2 per cent of the white females would survive to this age, compared to 80.4 per cent some twenty years earlier. By this older age the differential between the Jewish and white survival rates had widened over what it was in the 1960's

and also over what it was at age 45 in both the 1960's and the 1980's.
Above age 65, the relation between female Jewish and white survival chances changed substantially over the period being compared, coming to more closely resemble the differential patterns characterizing males. Based on the 1962-64 rates, Jewish females had less chance of surviving to ages 75 and 85 than did white females. By the 1980's, however, the Jewish female survival rate to age 75, like that of the Jewish males exceeded that of the white females, although the difference was not as sharp as for males. Just over three-fourths of all Jewish females would still be alive at age 75 compared to 72.0 per cent of white females. By age 85, however, the percentages were down to 42.9 per cent and 44.7 per cent respectively, very close but favoring whites. This finding compares to a differential favoring Jewish men over white men in the magnitude of 50 per cent.
Noteworthy, too, is the very substantial improvements for both Jewish and white females in chances of survival to the very oldest groups. Jewish female survival chances to age 85 more than doubled from 19.7 per cent to 42.9 per cent, whereas that of the whites, while also rising substantially, increased less, from 23.7 per cent to 43.9 per cent. As a result of the sharper improvements in Jewish survival rates, in the 1980's a higher proportion of Jewish female babies than of whites could expect to still be alive at all ages, except age 85, in contrast to the 1960's when the Jewish females lost their advantage by age 75.
As interesting as the differentials between Jewish and white females are,

92

especially striking about these data is the high proportion in both groups expected to survive late into the life cycle, if the age-specific death rates of the early years of the 1980 decade persisted throughout the lifetime of babies born in the 1960's. That about 94 per cent of the Jewish males and 95 per cent of the Jewish females would still be alive at age 55, and 65 per cent of the men and 76 per cent of the women at age 75 illustrates this point. While differing some, the survival rates of the total white group were equally impressive.
Moreover, as a result of their lower age-specific death rates at all but a few of the very youngest ages, a considerably higher proportion of females survive into old age than do males. By age 75, only 65 per cent of the Jewish males were likely to still be living compared to 76 per cent of the females, and by age 85, some 43 per cent of the women compared to 35 per cent of the men would be alive. The sex selective mortality suggested by these hypothetical statistics, based on mortality rates current in the late 1980's, correspond with reality as reflected in the low sex ratios among the aged population actually enumerated in surveys and censuses. Rhode Island in 1987, for example, had only 75 Jewish men aged 75 and over for every 100 Jewish women. The sex ratio was even more unbalanced for the aged white population; the 1990 census enumerated only 47 men for every 100 women among those age 75 and over. The sharper difference for whites than for Jews probably stems in large measure from the lower survival rates that white males, beginning at age 25, have in comparison to white females; those of Jewish men and women are

much closer to each other. This difference is already reflected in the fairly substantial difference in sex ratio characterizing those age 65-74; there were 88 Jewish men for every 100 Jewish women, but only 76 men for every 100 women among the larger white population.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
This research has asked whether religious identity and, in particular, being Jewish is associated with different patterns of mortality as indexed by age-specific death rates and life expectancy. Without adequate information to measure the direct impact of particular religious practices and customs on health status and survival levels, any attempt to assess the effect of religious identity on mortality level must be indirect. The results can therefore be little more than suggestive, especially if the available data do not allow full control for such key variables affecting life chances as education, occupation, and income. Yet, documentation of differences in mortality experience between religious groups can suggest whether differential life styles or possibly even genetic factors (when the group has been characterized by high degrees of homogamous marriage) associated with particular religious groups may help to account for their life chances.
To explore this question, mortality data available for the Jewish population of Rhode Island in the period centering on 1987 have been compared with those of the state's total white population. The assessment has been enriched by comparisons with the early 1960's, allowing attention to the extent to which the patterns of differentials

changed during the quarter century. For both periods, the absence of a question on religious identity on the official death certificates and in the federal census required use of alternate sources to obtain data on both Jewish deaths and the Jewish base population exposed to the risk of dying. Information from records maintained by funeral homes serving the Jewish community and from population surveys of the Jewish community in 1963 and 1987 were used to fill the vacuum in official data sources.
As a religion, Judaism stresses the sanctity of the body and the need to care for it. This view, as well as religious practices that required cleanliness, restricted the kinds of food eaten, emphasized restraint in consumption of alcoholic beverages, and prescribed circumcision for males, could be hypothesized to lead to better health and lower mortality among Jews. Concurrently, the high levels of education characterizing the Jewish-American population in recent decades, their heavy concentration in upper whitecollar occupations and the resulting higher-than-average income levels, their spatial concentration in metropolitan areas with relatively easy access to health facilities, and their clustering in better residential areas might all be expected to reenforce the religious values that favored good health and long life.
Yet, differentials in diet, in stress conditions associated with educational and occupational competition, and with minority status may counteract some of the benefits emanating from the positive factors. Moreover, none of these factors, positive or negative, are constant. Weakening of traditional re-

ligious values and practices, greater acculturation into the larger society, and high rates of intermarriage could all result in a narrowing of attitudinal and behavioral differentials between Jewish Americans and other Americans. Concurrently, higher educational and occupational achievement by non-Jews as well as social reforms that provided wider access to health facilities may result in less distinctive patterns of Jewish mortality. Together, these considerations have led to the hypothesis that over time the pattern of differentials observed in the early 1960's will have become less marked by the end of the 1980's.
The analysis for 1963 showed that, with differences in age composition controlled, the mortality of Jewish males differed minimally from that of white males while that of Jewish females was higher than that of white females generally. Based on this comparison, therefore, the findings did not support the original hypothesis. However, attention to the age-specific data showed that for both males and females Jewish mortality was below that of the white population at younger ages and only surpassed it in older groups. The explanations offered for the survival advantage characterizing younger Jews lay in the socioeconomic and religious factors favoring good health mentioned earlier. The reversal at older ages was speculated to be due to the greater susceptibility of older Jews, who having benefited from the conditions favoring good health in younger ages and survived to old age, to be exposed to chronic conditions which then took a higher toll among them. That chronic diseases accounted for comparatively more deaths among

94

older Jews than whites generally supported such a thesis.
Comparison of life expectancy at various stages of the life cycle showed average life expectancy at birth to favor Jewish males, but to vary minimally for females. The advantage in life expectancy of Jewish males declined, however, with advancing age and was actually lost beginning at age 65. Among females, Jewish life expectancy remained below that of whites at all ages, and the differential became increasingly higher from middle age onward.
The Rhode Island analysis, like several earlier studies of other communities showed that Jewish mortality and survival patterns differed from those of the general white population. Continuing assessment was clearly necessary of the relation between religious identity and mortality. The analysis using the 1987 survey of the Rhode Island Jewish population in conjunction with death records for 1985-89 allows such a follow-up evaluation.
In the interval between 1963 and 1987, the Jewish population of Rhode Island had aged markedly, more so than the general population. The sharp rise in the proportion of Jewish aged resulted from a combination of selective out-migration of younger persons, low Jewish fertility, and more persons living to older ages. One consequence was that in the 1980's, far more of the Jewish deaths occurred among the aged, 88 per cent among those age 65 and over and 68 per cent among those age 75 and over, than was true in the early 1960's when only 71 per cent of all deaths involved persons age 65 and over and 36 per cent those age 75 and over. This finding means that whatever

overall differentials characterized the Jewish and the larger white population in the late 1980's very largely reflected differentials in the aged population. It explains why the Jewish crude death rates for both males and females in 1987 were far above those of the comparable white groups, and why the differential narrowed considerably once compositional differences in age were controlled.
With age controlled, Jewish male mortality was, in fact, 16 per cent lower than that of whites compared to near equality in 1963. Jewish female mortality, by contrast, remained much greater than that of white females, more so even than in 1963. As in the 1960's, the factors affecting Jewish male and female mortality in comparison to white mortality continued to vary.
Consistent also with the 1960's patterns, age-specific death rates for Jews, both male and female, were with a few small exceptions for females, lower than those of whites at young and middle ages. Contrary to expectation, the advantage in the 1980's extended higher into the age hierarchy, and for men includes all but those age 85 and over. This finding suggests that factors accounting for more favorable life chances among the younger segments of the Jewish population compared to whites 25 years earlier may now be affecting the older groups as well, even while improvements also occurred among whites.
Jews and whites also experienced quite similar improvements in their average life expectancies at birth, about 8 per cent. The magnitude of gains made by Jewish males, however, were greater at older ages, and as a re-

suit extended the Jewish advantage in life expectancy further into the life cycle; only at age 85 and over could white males expect to live more years than Jewish males of comparable age. By contrast, in the late 1980's, as in the early 1960's, white women had an advantage over Jewish females in life expectancy at all ages. Males and females thus continued to vary considerably in extent of differences between Jews and whites generally as well as in the patterns of change since 1963.
This is reflected, too, in the proportions surviving to given ages under the mortality schedules operating in each period. Proportionally more Jews and whites could expect to live to older ages under the more recent regimen of death rates. However, the improvements were greater for Jewish men and women. Only at age 85, did Jewish women have a lower number surviving than did whites, and the differential was both minimal and below that of 1963 when Jewish women as well as Jewish men had considerably fewer survivors out of the original birth cohort than did whites.
Overall, therefore, the Jewish mortality experience continues to differ from that of the larger population's even while both groups have experienced noticeable improvements in the quarter century under observation. Whether the earlier differentials have narrowed or widened depends on the index used. For males, the agestandardized rates have widened in favor of Jews as have the percentage surviving to old age. By contrast, for females, the standardized death rate has widened considerably in favor of whites, while life expectancy at birth has improved quite similarly for both

groups and therefore remained about equal, as it was in 1963. On the other hand, from being disadvantaged in the proportion surviving to age 75 in 1963, more Jewish women than white women in 1987 could expect to survive to age 75. By age 85, however, the proportions were virtually identical at 43-45 per cent, but this represented a considerable improvement for Jewish women over the situation in 1963.
The mixed signals given by the different indicators reflect, in part, their varying sensitivity to the death rates operating at different stages of the life cycle and the fact that, judged by agespecific rates, Jews are favored at all but the most aged groups. In these age groups proportionally more of the Jewish population and of Jewish deaths are concentrated. In 1987, the fact that the male Jewish death rate exceeds that of whites only in the 85-and-over age group, whereas it did so in the three oldest groups in 1963, contributes to widening the standardized rates for males in favor of Jews. For the females, the higher age-specific mortality of Jews than of whites in the two oldest groups, more so for those age 75-84, than in 1963, helps to explain the widening of the rates for women which favored whites.
Life expectancy at birth reflects mortality experience at all later ages and therefore incorporates the effects both of the lower age-specific Jewish rates at earlier ages and of higher rates at the oldest ages. In contrast, the proportion surviving to a particular age reflects the effects of mortality only up to that age; until old age the survival rate is not affected by the poorer mortality experience of the Jewish aged. The lower mortality for Jews up to the

oldest ages is reflected in the better survival chances of Jews at older ages in 1987.
Again, we must stress that the factors underlying these patterns, including those responsible for the malefemale contrasts between Jews and whites cannot be determined from these data. Whether they stem from being Jewish per se, from selective inand out-migration of persons with different health status, or from other factors associated with Jewish identification, such as higher socioeconomic status and susceptibility to various kinds of disease, remains to be determined with sets of data not yet available that allow multivariate analysis. The continuation in 1987 of many of the differences observed in 1963 and the consistency of these differences with those observed in other communities using different kinds of data sets

as well as the attenuation of some and exacerbation of other differences observed in 1963 all argue for continued attention to the relation between religious identification and mortality patterns. Doing so may help provide better understanding of the dynamics underlying changes in mortality in the population as a whole.
