ABSTRACT: An attempt is made to study the interaction of inbreeding levels with other factors in influencing the intensity of natural selection. Results suggest that selection intensity values are high in the inbred and low socioeconomic groups of Madiga and Mala (1.545, 0.687). On the other hand, the non-inbred and high socioeconomic group of Maheshwari shows low selection intensity (0.543). Contribution of mortality to total index of selection is greater in the groups of Madiga and Mala (1.059, 1.062) than in the Maheshwari group (0.204).

Since Crow (1958) introduced the total index of opportunity for natural selection, several populations have been studied to find the evidence that socioeconomic and cultural levels play an important role in the relative contribution of the mortality and fertility components to the total index of selection (Spuhler 1962; Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer 1971). Studies on the Indian rural and tribal populations (Murty and Ramesh, 1978;Barua, 1976;Talukdar, 1977; Chengal Reddy and Lakshmanudu, 1979), which are generally characterized by poor nutrition, higher incidence of disease, and large family size, have supported this observation. Apart from these socioeconomic and cultural factors, large scale inbreeding is another factor characterizing South Indian populations and particularly that of Andhra Pradesh.
However, it is not known precisely to what extent this inbreeding interacts with other factors in influencing the intensity of natural selection.
Inbreeding in general is found to affect mortality to a greater extent and fertility only to a smaller extent (Cavalli-

Sforza et al., 1971). Recent studies of Sunder Rao et al. (1977) in Tamil Nadu have indicated that in highly inbred groups such as those of South India the effects of long-standing inbreeding are negligible both on mortality and fertility factors.
Since probability of death (Pj) increases under inbreeding and probability of survival (Ps) decreases, one expects a very significant increase in the index of selectiondue to mortality(1^) with inbreeding. On the other hand the effects_of inbreeding on mean and variance (X, Vx)of the number of live births were found to vary in different populations (Cavalli-Sforza etal., 1971; Schull, Komatsu, Nagano, and Yamamoto, 1968) so that the influence of inbreeding on the index of selection due to fertility (If) is likely to vary among different populations.
We have therefore made an attempt to examine empirically the effects of inbreeding on the intensities of selection, by comparison of the indices in some select populations chosen for their differences in socioeconomic level, food habits, and levels of inbreeding.

cally equivalent group, the Madiga (3.27). This is probably a result of the low sample size (« = 20) of Mala. The same might explain the low mean number of live births in the Mala women. Effects of socioeconomic status and inbreeding are insignificant on the mean number of live births, (F44 = 1.3195 and Fij4=0.3972 respectively)'.

Total index of selection, index of selection due to mortality, and index of selection due to fertility values of these groups are presented in Table 4. Both the mortality and fertility components of selection intensity are the highest in the Madiga (1.157,0.505), and they are the lowest in the Maheshwari (0.204, 0.339).
