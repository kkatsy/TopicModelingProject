ABSTRACT: Methods derived from stable population theory are employed to estimate the effect emigration is exerting upon the capacity of a Southwest Indian reservation population to develop economically. This capacity is measured by age-structure-dependent demographic indices which have been shown to affect the availability of development funds. Emigration is found to be absorbing all of the current positive growth of the population, decreasing and aging the available labor force and increasing the dependency burden upon nondependent members of the population. It is concluded that emigration affects the population structure in a way that could hinder economic development of the reservation population.

The capacity of a population to evolve economically or otherwise is not independent of its demographic structure. The available labor force, the dependency burden imposed by the very young and the very old, and the rates of reproduction and population growth and emigration all condition structural changes of economic, political, and social institutions to accommodate the changing population structure (Retherford, 1972). Demographic change and response can affect the nature and extent of social controls on individual behavior (Hardin, 1968), mate selection patterns (Matsunaga, 1966; Relé, 196S), land use and technological change (Boserup, 1965), ritual and political roles (Netting, 1972; Dumond, 1972), and social organization (Lee, 1972; Davis and Combs, 1949). Ordinarily, demographic changes responsible for structural changes of these kinds ultimately result from changes in values which are rooted in economic conditions of exis-

tence and the social status which these conditions bestow on the individual (Davis, 1963).
The most dramatic recent demographic change has been the rapid decline in death rates in less developed countries causing rapid population growth (Davis, 19S6). While this change was externally induced by Western medical and health administration, new values favoring lower fertility have emerged in some non-Western societies in response to new economic conditions imposed by rapid growth and the social and economic structures of urban centers (Kirk, 1971). For other societies, unfavorable demographic conditions and the time lag required for value reorientation may already have obviated this demographic response because the degree of economic development required to provide the economic incentives for lower family size is itself hindered by rapid growth (Davis, 1963).

When reproduction greatly exceeds mortality, maximum growth and greater youth dependency require heavy public service outlays, so-called "demographic investments," which divert funds from net investment and economic development programs (Coale and Hoover, 19S8). Populations with higher growth rates require proportionally greater investments of national income to produce a given level of increase in per capita income and hence, under certain conditions, also in savings, reinvestment, productivity, and development.1 Although the youthful and expanding labor force of rapidly growing populations is often receptive to new value orientations conducive to rapid social structural, political, and economic changes which better facilitate modernization (Davis and Combs, 1949), it may be unable to effect these changes because of lack of funds.
On the other hand, when reproduction and growth are low, elders form a larger portion of both the dependent population and the labor force. As such a population ages, it may become tradition-bound and less receptive to value reorientations associated with modernization (Kuznets, 1960). France is often cited as a case in point (Davis and Combs, 1949). However, since persons aged sixty-five and older form a minority in all populations, the greater oldage dependency may require less demographic investment. In addition, although the labor force is smaller, the slower growth and the low youth dependency release demographic investments, thus improving productive capabilities.
While the rapidly growing young population may be more receptive to change, it may lack funds to initiate change. The slow growing older population may have the necessary funds, but may resist change by

the strengthening of the existing traditional institutions. Both conditions constitute two different types of demographic constraint upon economic modernization.
Emigration and immigration are forces which can either augment or diminish the advantages of both demographic regimes. Since migration typically involves younger individuals, the effect of emigration in the community of origin should be to age the residual population (Valores, 1949), unless reciprocal immigration occurs. If young members of the labor force emigrate from a population showing rapid growth, high dependency might continue and indeed increase through time as the labor force grows smaller and old-age dependency increases. The advantages of a youthful progressive labor force could be lost as the labor force ages and the remaining nonmigrant population increasingly represents a residual traditional population. Such a population, then, will be subject to both forms of constraint opposing modernization.
The Sells Reservation Papago of southern Arizona, a residual tradition-bound population whose natural rate of population increase (birth minus deaths) is high, might represent such a population. Young upwardly mobile Papago acquire tastes for modern conveniences which can only be acquired either off the reservation or with wages supplied by wage-labor jobs which are not available on the Sells Reservation (Hackenberg, 1972). Since at least the turn of the century, a progressively deteriorating land base (Schulman, 1956; Glendening, 1952) has provided an additional incentive for emigration to achieve economic success. Analysis of a sample of emigrants from a restricted area of the Sells Reservation indicated that the average emigrant today leaves prior to marriage, slightly below the age of twenty (Hackenberg and Wilson, 1972).
The purpose of this study is to estimate

the effects of emigration upon the demographic constraints on economic modernization of the Sells Papago population by posing the following questions: (1) Has emigration alone increased the dependency load upon the adult labor force? (2) Has emigration diminished and aged the available labor force? (3) Has emigration altered the replacement capacity of the population? Further, since the data required to answer these and other questions using formal demographic techniques are usually unavailable for folk societies (Petersen, 1975), we shall determine whether answers to these questions can be obtained through an ordinary census of the population. It is from the analysis of the census population alone that the anthropologist must ordinarily draw inferences regarding the significance of demographic indicators as cause or effect.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our sample for analysis consists of all Papago living on the Sells Indian Reservation at the end of the year 1959 (slightly over 4,000 individuals) and all births and deaths occurring between the years 1955 and 1959. These data are contained within the Papago population register, based on the genealogical reconstruction of an ancestral population of 1875 together with all descendents to 1960 (Hackenberg, 1967). We have used vital events occurring within the five years prior to the benchmark date of 1960 because precise dates of birth and death, which are required for determining vital rates, are often unavailable or unreliable at earlier dates. The register records all founders of 1875 and their descendents who were born on the Sells Reservation but emigrated, and all who ever immigrated onto the reservation from off-reservation locations, but it does not indicate the age at or date of migration.

Our method is to construct a partial synthetic (cohort) abridged life table (using ten-year age groups) under observed conditions of emigration and immigration and another under the hypothetical condition excluding migration. Finally, such a life table will be constructed using census data alone, and intrinsic rates of birth and growth and the stable population age structures (female dominant) they determine compared with those of that table under observed conditions of migration.
If the census is a reliable indicator of the demographic characteristics of the population (i.e., if no recent changes in fertility and mortality have occurred), the two stable age structures should agree closely since both reflect the effects of migration. When either of these stable structures is compared with the stable structure ignoring the effects of migration, the effects that migration is exerting upon the age structure of the population can be inferred. Given relatively constant death (Ma,) and birth (bx) rates (the vital rates) over a period of time, a population approaches its stable form unless otherwise perturbed.
Once stable, the population either remains stationary or increases or decreases at a constant rate. Even when perturbed, it returns to relative stability within two or three generations (Coale, 1972). Since the rate of growth, r, can never differ greatly from zero (otherwise the population would rapidly either exceed the maximum which resources can support or would become extinct), the vital rates, barring external perturbations, can indeed change only slowly, if at all. As a result, a population will never stray far from the unique age structure intrinsic to these current vital rates upon which the age structure totally depends (excepting migration). If the population is unstable, as all probably are, the stable age structure, in the absence of any marked perturbations in recent decades,

can indicate the direction toward which the observed age structure is changing.
While there is some evidence that mortality declined from just over 30 per thousand in 1940 (Jones, 19S3; Joseph et al., 1949) to about IS per thousand in 1960 (Smith, 1973), the earlier death rates were estimated for only small selected areas of the reservation, some of which contained migrant labor camps where infectious diseases were endemic due to poor living conditions. Mortality declines since 1940, for the population as a whole, were probably less dramatic than the earlier mortality estimates would indicate. Even were they not, mortality declines, unlike changes in fertility, affect the entire age distribution (albeit, not equally at all age levels) and hence only minimally affect its overall stability. While fertility changes usually have pronounced effects upon stability (since the entire effect is exerted upon the 0-1 age group), fertility of the Sells Reservation Papago has not changed since at least the turn of the century (Uhlman, 1972). Recent changes in vital rates are unlikely, then, to have appreciably affected either the approach of the population toward stability or the nature of the stable age structure intrinsic to vital rates prevailing between 1955 and 1959. Further, our analysis will develop so as either to remain unaffected by recent changes in vital rates or to provide means to detect such effects.
The effect of emigration can be included in life tables by treating each emigrant (or each member lost through the combined forces of emigration and immigration) as a death (Cox, 1970). A comparison of the stable distribution under current birth, death, and migration rates with that distribution intrinsic only to the observed death and birth rates, ignoring migration, will indicate the effect which migration is exerting on the population.
Age-specific mortality rates for our pur-

poses, defined as the proportion of the population dying during a hypothetical tenyear period) are calculated as Mx = 2ioDx/ioPx where ioDx is the number of deaths to those aged x to x + 10 between 1955 and 1959 and 1OPX is the total population aged x to x + 10 at midpoint of the time interval during which the deaths occurred (the midterm population). These and other rates were calculated for tenyear age groups since this is often the most reliable census grouping to which the anthropologist can aspire. The probability of not surviving from exact age x to exact age x -f- 10, io<7x, can easily be shown to be

Then, lop3r,the probability of surviving from age x to age a: + 10, is 1 -- io<7*.Agespecific fertility rates are: iobx = 2iaBx/ 10Pfj: where i0Bx is the number of births between 1955 and 1959 to mothers aged x to x -\-10 and ioPt~f is the midterm female population aged x to x -f- 10. Of the hypothetical population, l0 in number, which experiences the observed vital rates of each group as it moves through the age distribution, the number of each age group which survives to exact age x -\- 10 is given by ^ + i o = pJx where l0, the radix, is arbitrarily set at 100 (i.e., everyone ever born survives to exact age zero). The fraction of a person-year lived by an average individual during the average year is approximated as lx = lt-\- lx+io/2lo. Using only census data, lx can be determined as follows: loi*, the probability of surviving from exact age x to exact age x -f- 10, is set equal to í o ^ + i o / i o ^ which represents the ratio of the numbers of individuals in the observed census population in two adjacent age groups (Stolnitz, 1956).

marked differences in the numbers in adjacent age groups. Adjustments can be made by simply summing the Px which is out of sequence with that preceding and that following it (i.e., Px-i0 + PX + Px+ro) and assigning to Px the new value obtained by dividing that sum by three (Benjamin and Haycocks, 1970). The excess or shortage of the adjusted over the actual population of this age group is then equally divided between the preceding and following age groups.
The stable age distribution under emigration is derived from the life table constructed with qx values which include agespecific frequencies of net migration loss (emigration--immigration). Since neither age at nor year of emigration is known, age-specific migration rates were estimated by assuming that the proportion lost to net migration and the age distribution of these has not changed in recent decades. Since emigration to locations where wage-labor jobs are available has been an economic alternative exercised by Papago since at least as early as the seventeenth century (Hackenberg, 1964), the proportion of Sells Papago who emigrate could not have changed greatly during this century. Since immigration rates are less than one-tenth of those for emigration, even substantial changes in numbers of immigrants or their age distributions will have little effect upon age-specific migration loss. Since the turn of the century, immigration rates have, on the average, been below one immigrant per thousand population per year, and emigration rates have been roughly ten to fifteen emigrants per thousand population per year (Smith, 1973).
The total population at risk of ever emigrating was determined by reverse-surviving the entire population alive at the end of 1959 through all age groups through which each individual would have passed, given complete survival. This task required

calculating rates of survival (sx) from each successive age group to the next by s0 = 5ÍO/A> and sx = íoL+io/ioL- Since the midterm population at risk, used to arrive at qx and lx, is affected by age-specific net migration loss, which is yet unknown, it is necessary to obtain a first approximation of Mx as (ioAr)/d<A) and 4 + 1 0 as pjx. This calculation assumes only that mortality has not changed since the time that individuals of that age where emigration is completed were born. Since all emigration was found to be effectively completed by age 30, we must then assume that mortality has been relatively stable only since 1930.
The resulting hypothetical nonmigrant population that would have been observed at the end of 1959 under complete survival, Px, can be approximated by:
where II is the sum product, / denotes each ten-year age group through which the individual would have passed during his life to 1959, n is the age group in which he would now fall whether or not he lived, and J4 is the survival function for the ¿th age group, where each of the age groups is numbered sequentially beginning with the number 1 for the age group 0-4.
Each age group of the total hypothetical 1959 population under complete survival was then augmented by the number who would have fallen in that age group of the reservation population had they not emigrated (less those who immigrated) and this total (which we will call the potential population) becomes the denominator for the proportion of those at risk who ever emigrated. Since, for example, 0.1497 of the potential 1959 population aged 0-4 was lost to net migration, the proportion of the population lost to net migration, Çem, before

reaching exact age 5 is taken to be 0.1497. Since 0.1498 of the potential population aged 5-9 was ever lost to net migration, 0.1498-0.1497 or 0.0001 is taken as the proportion lost between ages 5 and 9.
This procedure was first conducted upon five-year age groups, since the ten-year age groups 0-9 and 20-29 were each found to combine two five-year age groups which would have differed considerably in their emigration rates. The method was continued through successive age groups until the ratio of the number ever lost to the potential 1959 population failed to increase, indicating the cessation of net migration loss. The fact that loss is heavy for the first five-year age group and almost nil for the second, implies that these emigrants are offspring of young adults who probably leave in their early twenties (i.e., an age where few parents have offspring whose age is greater than five years). The fact that the figures for qem for the three five-year age groups spanning ages 15 through 29 are, respectively, 0.027, 0.195 and 0.006 supports the premise that adult emigration effectively ends by about age 25. The qem proportions were then collapsed into tenyear age groups and were, respectively, 0.1498, 0.0891, and 0.1973 for the first three age groups and 0.0000 for all others.
Only changes in vital rates and their distribution occurring since 1930 can affect the accuracy of our methods. If mortality has declined since 1930, emigration rates for age groups beyond age ten would be overestimated. But if emigration has increased since 1930, these rates would be underestimates. We have argued that changes of such recency will be both minimal and offsetting, such that our estimates of age-specific emigration rates cannot be too far off.
To obtain the midterm population with which to calculate corrected lx values, the 1955 population was estimated by:

where 6DX is the number of deaths occurring between 1955 and 1959 to those aged * to x -f- 5. An arbitrary value is first assumed for 5PV955 to obtain 5P*1955 and the estimation reiterated, setting the acquired B / y 9 5 5 value to 5 P y 9 5 5 until 5 P y 9 5 5 and 5p^i955 converge to give the true estimate of 5Ptf1955. The midterm population is then obtained as SPX = 5 / y 9 5 5 + 5Px10S9/2 and the corrected bx and Mx values calculated using 5PX as the new denominator.
To construct the stable population without emigration, the qx values were used to obtain 1X in the manner previously described. To construct the stable population under emigration, q'x values were used to arrive at lx where q'x = qx + qem- The two stable structures were then compared, an ID calculated, and various age-structuredependent demographic indices that affect the adaptive capacities of economic structures computed for comparison.
Finally, the stable census population was constructed, and the statistical significance of the linear regression used to estimate r and b was determined using the variance ratio (F), the regression sum of squares to the mean of the within sum of squares. The derived age structure was next compared with the stable population without emigration to again estimate the effects of emigration upon the age structure. The results obtained from the stable forms of the census and observed populations were then compared for consistency.
Since any changes in vital rates will affect the two stable age structures constructed from vital registration data equally, such inferences derived from the comparison of these two structures will be valid even under conditions of recent demographic change. While a decline in mortality can affect the comparison of the stable popula-

28

tion ignoring migration with that constructed from the census population alone, we can detect such an effect by contrasting the comparisons of the stable structure including migration with both that structure ignoring migration and that structure constructed from the census data alone. If the variation of the two stable age structures which reflect the effects of migration from the observed age structure are in the same direction and if the variation of these two structures from that excluding the effects of migration are also in the same direction, then recent changes in mortality and emigration can be assumed not to have influenced inferences drawn from census data alone regarding the effects of emigration upon the direction of demographic change.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The Px and lx values for all three life tables are given in Table 1 with their cor-

tion life tables agreed fairly closely, declining somewhat more rapidly with advancing age in the census population, and the comparison of their stable populations gives an ID of 7.46, showing reasonably close concordance.
The stable population under emigration contained an excess of individuals over age 60 and too few under age 10 when compared with the stable structure of the census population. Since adjusted Px values were required only for ages 30 through 60, our smoothing of the census population cannot have significantly affected the stable age distributions. A slight trend since 1930 either toward emigrating at younger ages and before marriage or toward emigrating at later ages with nuclear family units containing young offspring could be partially responsible. The age distribution of qem values would seem to support the latter explanation, since the great majority of

for the observed population, for the stable population both excluding and including migration, and for the census population. The approach to stability is increasing the proportion of Papago in the youthful labor force (ages 20-29), but most of the increase will be absorbed by current emigration rates. While the older component of the labor force would decline slightly without emigration, emigration would increase their proportion in the stable population by almost 2 per cent. The proportion of the population in the total labor force -would increase, but emigration will counteract this trend.
While wiihout emigration the proportion over age 70 would decline, emigration will increase this proportion. The dependency ratio, the ratio of those aged under 10 and over 70 to the remaining population (defined in this manner for convenience of ten-year age groups) should decline as stability is approached; but emigration will minimize this decline by increasing the representation in the population of those over age 70 and by retarding the growth of the total labor force.

Emigration has little effect upon the youth component of dependency which will decline with or without emigration, and the effect of emigration upon the birth rate is also minimal. While the birth rate should decline somewhat as stability approaches, emigration will decrease the birth rate only slightly more than would occur in its absence. The greatest effect of emigration will be upon the growth rate. The current annual growth rate of almost 1.5 per cent should, regardless of emigration, decline at least to just over 1 per cent, where it would stabilize if vital rates did not change. If current emigration and other vital rates continue, however, the growth rate will continue to decline, until, at stability, the population is declining at a constant rate of somewhat less than 0.5 per cent per year.
CONCLUSION
Overall, the effect of a net migration loss of 13-16 per 1,000 per year is to decrease the natural rate of population increase and youthfulness of the population. With or without emigration, dependency would decline, and the proportions in the young and

the total labor force would increase. However, emigration minimizes both of the above, by increasing the proportion of population over age 70 and decreasing the proportion aged 20-39.
If development potential is viewed in terms of available capital outlays which are proportional to the size of the labor force, progressive mindedness of a youthful labor force, and minimization of demographic investments, the effect of emigration upon the Sells Papago will be to hinder economic development of the residual reservation population.
With structural instability yielding an ID as high as 9.0, the census data alone led to conclusions which differed only in magnitude, not in direction, from those obtained with the register data. Both cases indicate that the advantage of a youthful labor force which results from rapid population growth is counteracted by heavy

emigration of the young members of the population.
Answers to questions posed in this study appear to be relatively insensitive to errors caused by lack of perfect structural stability in the Sells Papago population. Since the ideal of the stable population is seldom if ever observed in the real world, and the census is often the only demographic data accessible to the anthropologist, it will be paramount to identify other types of questions whose answers can be usefully approached through stable population theory under various conditions of approximate stability.
