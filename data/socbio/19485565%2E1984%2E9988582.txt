ABSTRACT:Based on a very large sample of married women aged 15 to 49 from the 1970 census of Mexico, the effect of literacy and education on the number of children ever born in different size communities is investigated. While cumulative marital fertility tends to be inversely related to community size, the overall shape of the education-fertility relationship is generally similar in rural, semi-urban, small urban, and large urban localities. These results combined with those for literacy do not support the hypothesis of an urbanization or a literacy "threshold" at which women's schooling begins to reduce family size.

In a very thorough review of the literature, Cochrane (1979) presents a theoretical framework for analyzing the effect of education on fertility. Her model, an elaboration of one developed by Easterlin (1975), hypothesizes that fertility is determined by the potential biological supply of children, by parental demand for children, and by fertility regulation. Briefly, education can increase the supply of children through better health and greater fecundity, or education can decrease the potential number of children through raising the age at first marriage and consequently reducing exposure to pregnancy. Increasing amounts of schooling generally decrease the demand for children by changing traditional values and altering the perceived economic costs and benefits of children. By creating more positive attitudes toward contraception and by improving knowledge of birth control techniques, education typically promotes fertility regulation.
Increasing amounts of education are

usually, but not always, found to be associated with lower fertility in less developed countries (Williams, 1976; Graff, 1979; Cochrane, 1979; Jain, 1981). For Latin America, the results of aggregate fertility studies using literacy or educational attainment as the independent variable show mixed results (Heer and Turner, 1965; Stycos, 1968, 1982; Zarate, 1967; Hicks, 1974; Seiver, 1975; Beaver, 1975).' With a few exceptions (Davidson, 1973; Smith, 1981), individual level studies tend to more consistently report a negative relation between education and fertility (Gendell, et al., 1967; Rosen and Simmons, 1971; CELADE/CFSC, 1972; Uthoff and Gonzales, 1976; Weeks, 1978; Lerner, 1979;Secretaria de Programacion yPresupuesto, 1979).

As a question for further research, Cochrane (1979) suggests that we need to examine why an inverse fertilityeducation relation is more likely to be found in urban than in rural areas. It may be because the urban environment intensifies the fertility-depressing effect of education through one or more of the channels posited in Cochrane's model. Or, it may simply be because cities have higher proportions of educated inhabitants than smaller localities. Utilizing data on individuals from the 1970 census of Mexico, the present study seeks to shed some light on this issue by comparing the effect of female literacy and education on marital fertility in rural, semiurban, small urban, and large urban communities. The very large number of cases in the data set permit a detailed description of the relevant empirical relationships for the second most populous country in Latin America and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE
The data come from a one-in-ahundred sample of the 1970 General Census of the Population of Mexico. Restricting the sample to native-born women in legal or consensual union aged 15 to 49 who have completed their education yields 65,355 cases.
VARIABLES
Fertility.--Thedependent variable is operationalized as the average number of children ever born (CEB) per married women. These data suffer from a number of limitations. Among the major ones are underreporting due to memory bias (Shryock, et al., 1976; Ed-

monston and Saposnikow, 1976), and omission of some children, such as those who died soon after birth and older children who have left home, because of failure to understand the fertility question (Coale, 1971). For the most part, however, these kinds of limitations are more serious when attempting to determine the level of fertility than fertility differentials (Bogue, 1971, p. 114). Since the same women who have larger families, namely rural women with less education, are also more likely to underreport their children, the bias in the present instance is probably toward understating the true magnitude of the observed fertility differentials.
Literacy and Education.--Apparently only those individuals who both read and write were classified as literate (Direction General de Estadistica,1972, p. LXX). Level of education is divided into no education, one to three years primary, four to five years primary, six years or complete primary, secondary, and preparatory /university. Primary school is so categorized in order to test if a little education has a positive effect on fertility; the last category is a combined one because of the close association between preparatory and university training in Mexico and because of the very small number of university cases in communities of fewer than 100,000 residents. The classifications secondary and preparatory/university include those who completed some but not all the years of schooling at that level of education.
The sample is restricted to married women who are recorded on the census tape as not currently enrolled in school, that is, to those who have, at least temporarily, "completed" their schooling. The primary reason for this restriction is because there are irreconcilable coding

errors for some married women (approximately 2.2 per cent of all married women aged 15 to 49) marked as currently attending school. Confining the sample in this manner also simplifies the interpretation of the effect of education on fertility.
Residence.--Four sizes of communities are distinguished: rural settlements of fewer than 2,500 inhabitants, semiurban localities of from 2,500 to 19.999 inhabitants, small urban places of from 20,000 to 99,999 inhabitants, and large urban centers of 100,000 or more inhabitants. These categories reasonably divide the urbanization continuum and are similar to those used in previous studies (Miro and Mertens, 1968; Secretarfa de Programacidn y Presupuesto, 1979).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The bulk of the analysis consists of comparing the average number of CEB per married woman for various categories of literacy and education while simultaneously controlling for age and size of community. Since this CEB statistic is expressed in units of the data themselves, its meaning is relatively unambiguous, it is directly comparable across subgroups, and it requires a minimal number of assumptions. Additionally, an analysis of covariance is performed in order to test for the interaction between education and residence on cumulative marital fertility.
RESULTS
LITERACY
Attention is first directed to the distribution of married women by literacy status and residence (Table 1). These data show a strong, positive relationship

between proportion literate and size of community; it is 54.8 per cent in rural areas and increases steadily to 84.9 per cent in large urban areas.
The results for the average number of CEB per married woman are initially presented in terms of the observed fertility means (Unadjusted panel) which, however, do not take account of age differences among the literacy-residence subgroups. Accordingly, these CEB data are directly standardized on the age structure of the population within each residence (Std. Residence panel) as well as directly standardized on the age structure of the total population (Std. Total panel). Comparison of the standardized literate-illiterate CEB means within each type of community--the single, overall-F-ratio derived from the Standardized Total analysis not being statistically significant (p = 0.236)--shows that literate married women have slightly more children than illiterate married women in rural areas. Thereafter, though, literate wives have fewer children than their illiterate counterparts with the difference seemingly widening with each increase in size of community. At first examination, then, it appears that the effect of literacy on cumulative marital fertility is conditioned by the degree of urbanization.
EDUCATION
As indicated by the results in Table 2, married women in Mexico generally possess low levels of education but the situation is worse the smaller the community. To illustrate, 58.5 per cent of the wives in large urban areas have fewer than six years of primary school; the corresponding proportions are 67.0 per cent in small urban areas, 81.7 per cent in semiurban areas and 94.5 per cent in rural areas.

The CEB averages for education are presented in the same format as for literacy. Examination of the values in the Standardized Total panel, which permit comparison across residence as well as education categories, shows that at most educational levels fertility is inversely associated with degree of urbanization. (See also Figure 1.) The exceptions are at no education and one to three years primary levels in large urban areas and at secondary and preparatory/university

levels in small urban areas. Of particular interest, though, is the similarity of the relationship between marital fertility and level of education within each type of community. To illustrate, married women with one to three years of primary school have slightly more CEB than married women with no education; there is typically a small decline in the average number of CEB for those with four to five years of primary school and additional substantial declines for those

with complete primary, secondary, and preparatory/university educations.
It should be emphasized that in all four residential settings the first large fertility decline does not occur until the completion of the six-year primary cycle. Compared to wives with no education (Std. Total panel), wives with completed primary school have 0.65 fewer CEB in rural areas, 0.75 fewer CEB in semi-urban areas, 0.69 fewer CEB in small urban areas and 0.97 fewer CEB in large urban areas. While fertility declines of a comparable magnitude typically occur at secondary and

preparatory/university levels, the number of married women involved becomes proportionately much smaller, especially in nonurban localities.
Analysis of Covariance
The findings presented so far suggest that there is not likely to be a substantial interaction between level of education and size of community on cumulative marital fertility. But, because this issue is of interest, the results of the analysis of covariance are presented in Table 3. In this analysis the effects of age (covari-

small urban areas. Further inspection of the results shows that the main effect of education on marital fertility is relatively small.2 This is because there are large within-group variances compared to small differences in the means forthe no education, one to three years primary, andfour tofiveyears primarycategories, the same categories that comprise thelarge majority of women in any size community.
SUMMARY
Based on an analysis of a very large sample of married women aged 15to 49 from the 1970 census of Mexico, the following empirical findings stand out.
2When main effects are processed before the covariate and interaction terms, the sum of squares attributed to residence increases to 365.3 and the sum of squares attributed to education increases greatly to 23,251.3; the corresponding value for the age covariate remains practically the same and the explained, residual, and total sum of squares are identical.

There is an inverse relation between the average number of CEB per married women and size of community. Literate wives have slightly more children than illiterate wives in rural areas, but in more urbanized regions this differential reverses and seems to widen with each increase in size of community. The shape of the female education-maritalfertility relation isgenerally similar in all four residential settings. That is, fertility is slightly higher at oneto three yearsof primary school than at no education, it declines slightly at four to five yearsprimary, and then declines substantially at complete primary, secondary, and preparatory/university levels. An analysis of covariance reveals a statistically significant butsmall interaction between education and residence on cumulative marital fertility.
DISCUSSION
A little education, one to three years of primary school, appears to exert a

Vol. 31, No. 3-4

small positive effect on fertility, particularly in rural habitats. This may operate through the mechanism of the biological supply of children (Cochrane, 1979). That is, women with a few years of schooling may be healthier and more fecund than women with no education and consequently bear more children.
Of the other issues raised by thefindings we can next ask what might account for the similarity of the female education-marital-fertility relation in different size localities of Mexico. Unfortunately, the census data do not contain information on age at marriage, breastfeeding, contraceptive usage, or other variables that could help explain the observed regularities. The closest explanatory variable that can be derived from the available data is the proportion of young women who are currently married which, by extension, approximates age at marriage. Table 2 displays the proportion of 15 to 19 year old females who are in legal or consensual union by residence and the education categories no education through complete primary. With one major exception (rural, no education), there is relatively little difference in the proportion married among those with no education, one to three years primary or four to five years primary.3 Within each type of community, however, the proportion of 15to 19 year old women who are in marital union is reduced by approximately onehalf at the complete primary level. This pattern of "age at marriage" by level of completed education roughly corresponds to the observed pattern of cumu-

lative marital fertility by completed education and is likely an important causeof it. As such, this finding lends empirical support to the path in Cochrane's (1979) theoretical model which sees education as limiting the supply of children by raising age at marriage and hence reducing exposure to pregnancy.
How might the discrepancy between the results for literacy and education be reconciled? An additional crosstabulation of the data reveals that married women with fertility-depressing educational characteristics (complete primary or more) constitute 49.0 per cent of the literate category in large urban areas, 41.2 per cent of the literate category in small urban areas, 26.1 per cent of the literate category in semiurban areas, and only 9.9 per cent of the literate category in rural areas. Thus, the more rural the community the less likely a literate-illiterate fertility differential is to be found because, in addition to the positive fertility effect of a little education, a smaller proportion of the literate group possesses the minimum amount of education needed to reduce fertility. In this light, it appears that the key factor is not the degree of urbanization or per cent literate but the proportion of married women with fertilitydepressing education.
The results may also provide an insight into why aggregate studies have been less successful than individuallevel studies in discovering an inverse education-fertility relation in Latin America. Cochrane (1979, p. 28) notes that if the relationship between a given variable and fertility is nonlinear at the individual level, then the aggregate relationship will depend not only on the nature of the relationship but also on the distribution of persons along the variable. As the findings for Mexico show,

306

the female education-marital fertility relation is apparently nonlinear at the individual level and different size localities vary greatly in the proportion of married women at various stages of completed education. Whether a negative effect of education on fertility at the aggregate level is observed or not, then, will depend heavily on the educational composition of the macro units under investigation.
In conclusion, the overall greater impact of female education on cumulative marital fertility in urban as compared to semi-urban as compared to rural communities of Mexico is primarily due to the proportion of married women with fertility depressing educational backgrounds rather than to a markedly different effect of education,perse, on fertility. Thus, the results support neither an urbanization nor a literacy "thresh-

old" at which education begins to have a fertility reducing impact. The results do emphasize the country-wide importance of completion of the entire six year primary cycle -- important because it is associated with the first substantial drop in fertility and because it accounts for the large majority of married women for whom education makes a difference in the number of children they bear.
