ABSTRACT: A study of factors influencing genetic counseling attendance rate has been conducted in the Bouches-du-Rhône area, in the south of France. In this area, a birth defects monitoring system (Eurocat n°22) annually covers 23,000 births. All the genetic services are delivered by only one genetic center located in Marseilles, and the data collected are computerized. The comparison of these two data bases gives an opportunity to estimate the rate of genetic counseling attendance after the occurrence of an affected stillbirth or live birth. Among the parents of 358 infants born in 1983-84 in this area with a pathology requiring genetic counseling, 226 (63 per cent) attended the Genetic Center within the first year after birth. The rate of attendance is statistically higher (p < 0.01)fortheparentswhohadastillbirth (78 per cent) than for those who had a live birth (57 per cent). It is also higher (p < 0.01) for the Marseilles maternities group (68 per cent) than for the group outside Marseilles (50 per cent). The referral delays are also analyzed according to malformation etiology and to viability of the child by the eighth day of lue. Besides evaluating a particular genetic center's effectiveness in diffusing information to the public concerned, this work shows that couples' request is strongly dependent on a psychological need.

Genetic counseling and consultation at prenatal diagnosis clinics are now, in most Western countries, accepted procedures for the prevention of birth defects. Whether genetic counseling contributes to prevent recurrences by influencing reproductive choices of couples is still argued (Wertz and Sorenson, 1986; Chase et al., 1987). Theoretically, genetic counseling should help consultées in understanding medical facts, including the diagnosis, in appreciating the way heredity contributes to the disorder, in selecting the course of action which seems appropriate to them in view of their risk of recurrence, in

making the best adjustment to their problem, and in choosing the way their next pregnancy can be managed (Sorenson et al., 1981). After the birth of an index child with a severe defect, genetic counseling will decrease anxiety for the majority of couples as the contribution of genetics to most birth defects is small. Ideally, all the couples should attend a genetic counseling clinic in the months following the birth of an affected child. In fact, only some of them attend such clinics.
The objectives of this work were to measure the genetic clinic attendance rate during the first year after the birth

Two computerized data bases from counseling or prenatal diagnosis clinics the same area in France (Bouches du before the birth of the affected child

Rhône area including the city of Marseilles) were compared. The annual number of births in this geographic area is about 23,000.
The first data base is a birth defect monitoring system (Eurocat, n° 22) running since January 1, 1983. Each birth defect (gestational age > 19 weeks) in a child or fetus whose parents are residents of the Bouches-du-Rhône area is reported to the register. These include only birth defects which are detectable at birth. Spontaneous notifications are complemented with systematic surveys of hospital case notes, prenatal diagnosis, and cytogenetic and post-mortem examination reports. The chart includes child identification, the main clinical symptoms, and the names of physicians

were excluded since they could be considered as already informed. For all the other cases reported, a list of the diagnoses for which referral to a genetic clinic was medically justified has been established according to the final diagnosis on their file (Table 1). This list was defined according to two criteria corresponding to the role of the genetic consultation. The first criterion is related to the existence of a severe birth defect either completely or partially of genetic origin. The second criterion is the availability of a prenatal diagnosis in case of recurrence of the birth defect in the next pregnancy. Availability of prenatal diagnosis has been classified as possible or not possible according to the current state of knowledge (Mattéi et al., 1986).

in charge of the mother and/or child. Diagnostic conclusions and a summary of the information on the risks of recurrence, frequency of the disease, and availability of prenatal diagnosis procedures for this condition are sent by the geneticist in charge of the register to these physicians and to the maternity hospital where the child was delivered.

Among the group of parents of malformed or stillborn children born in 1983 and 1984 and defined according to the three previous criteria, the Genetic Center data bases made it possible to differentiate between those who attended the genetic clinic during the first year after birth and those who did not.

This percentage is in agreement with the one observed in our series. In contrast, Sadovnick et al. (1987), in a study about use of genetic counseling services in Canada for neural tube defects, found a rate of live birth spina bifida referrals of 92 per cent (15/17), a rate of stillbirth spina bifida referrals of 40per cent (2/5), and a rate of anencephalic births referrals of 45per cent (121/223) for 1982-83. Our results differ markedly since we have 67 per cent for live birth spina bifida, 62 per cent for stillbirth spina bifida, and 79 per cent for anencephalies. If, in our study, genetic counseling is most often sought after a stillbirth with a neural tube defect, it is probably because of the systematic post-mortem examination and the personal letter addressed to the declaring physician.
The increasing rates of attendance during the third and fourth months by parents of stillbirths also suggest the impact this post-mortem examination has on referrals. The difference in the rates of attendance observed between parents of stillbirths and live births may be explained by the fact that it takes at least one or two months after a stillbirth for autopsy results to be transmitted to physicians. As can be seen with the results analyzed here, physician and patient do ask for the expert advice of a geneticist even when they have the conclusions of the pathology report. Without such a post-mortem protocol, it would be impossible to give the parents precise information on the causes of death. If the overall rate of attendance for De Wals et al. (1986) was 78 per cent for the malformed stillbirths, it was 93 per cent for autopsied stillbirths and 23 per cent for the non-autopsied ones. As mentioned by these authors, the key to an adequate diffusion of genetics services is physicians' attitudes. An editorial, "The ab-

horrence of stillbirth" (1977), underlines that "the immediate goal is for a taboo to be broken, for stillbirth to be recognized as a common crisis which calls for immediate and long term support for the family". Kowalski (1980) also insists on the role of professionals in managing perinatal loss. In general, if women have a very favorable attitude toward the extension of prenatal diagnosis indications (Doherty and Roghmann, 1979), the context is very different for physicians (Julian, 1986; Lippman-Hand and Piper, 1981; Lippman-Hand and Cohen, 1980; Weitz, 1979). However, our results suggest that the barriers to the diffusion of information about prenatal diagnosis are reduced if the physician is directly confronted with the parents of an index case and if he is adequately informed about the genetic components of the pathology.
The attendance rates observed in this study are applicable only to the Bouches du Rhône area with its particular health care organization and for a certain period of time. We would need to do other studies to compare the values observed. The conclusions about the impact of stillbirth occurrence is however generalizable to every provider of genetics services and underlines the need for a diagnostic protocol followed by genetic expertise when necessary, but also for psychological help for the parents. An extension of genetic counseling diffusion to couples with an affected child requires particular attention to improving physician's information, particularly on non-Mendelian pathologies.
