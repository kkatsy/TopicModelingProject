Most studies exploring the relationship between morbidity and social factors have been purely demographic in nature; that is, they have investigated differentials in morbidity and their relationships to other demographic vital events, namely migration and mortality in the population. Recently, however, many have come to suspect that factors in the social structure or social organization have an important, if not a crucial, bearing on the occurrence of morbidity. One of the central theses underlying this view is that inconsistencies among significant aspects of the individual's position within the social and cultural structure result in the development of social stress which subsequently has an adverse effect on his physical and mental health. It is also expected, and often found, that groups of persons constantly exposed to social strains that may induce unpleasant, threatening social and psychological stress have high probabilities of living in poor health conditions.
Although recent studies have also suggested a possible inverse relationship between social class and differential rates of morbidity, they have generally neglected other sociogenic sources of stress which may exert some influence upon the total course

of ill health. For example, most social epidemiological studies focus upon the prevalence of morbidity in terms of social status rather than upon a detailed comparative analysis of morbidity by controlling for migration and residence status. This lack of differentiation and control may tend to obscure the relationship between social class and illness.
To review current knowledge on the relationship of sociocultural factors to the occurrence of chronic illness, a few studies of social stress are cited as of possible etiological relevance (Jackson, 1962; Jackson and Burke, 196S; Dodge and Martin, 1970; Kasl and Cobb, 1969). Several investigators have utilized macro-sociological variables as alternative indicators of socially induced stress which has often been considered as having an adverse effect on health conditions. These major variables are social class (Meile and Haese, 1969; McBroom, 1970), social mobility (Lystad, 1957; Kantor, 1965), migration (Malzberg and Lee, 1956), status integration (Dodge and Martin, 1970), and population density (Christian, 1968). However, most studies have investigated the independent effect of the main variables rather than the interactive and synergistic effects of the multi-

variates on the dependent variable. Thus, explanations for the relationships between social factors and illness were always inconclusive. Consequently, most generalizations derived from these studies only posit an implicit indirect association between social factors and illness.
The conceptual framework of the present study is that various population groups have different vulnerabilities to disease and that different levels of social-psychological stress induced by different social strains (stressors) lead to differential rates of morbidity. Social strains may be characterized by three selected macro-sociological variables--status inconsistency, socioeconomic status (SES), and migration-residence status. These factors are considered as sociogenic sources of stress which is denned by its prolonged and unpleasant stimulating condition. The variation in total morbidity rates is expected to be relative to the different risks of the population groups exposed to these three social-etiological factors (see Figure 1).
It is postulated that the occurrence of morbidity varies directly with the multiplicity of social strains a population experiences. The objectives of this investigation are twofold: first, to demonstrate the

existence of a linkage between the prevalence of morbidity and sociogenic sources of strain; and second, to detect the interactive effects of social strains on morbidity. The central concern of this study is to explore the probable synergistic impact of social strains on ill health.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The information was obtained from data collected in household interviews in the nationwide Survey of Economic Opportunity conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Office of Economic Opportunity in February, 1967. The major purpose of this survey was to provide a comprehensive picture of the economic wellbeing of the population for the calendar year 1966. Sociodemographic information pertinent to the primary objective of the survey was obtained from respondents in stratified random samples representing the total population of the United States.
The study population used in the testing of the hypotheses is limited to adult male heads of families and other unrelated males between the ages of 25 through 64. This limitation overcomes the irregularities that would be introduced by using a more heterogeneous universe. Data on health and

b -- y/R(1000--R)/N, where R was the morbidity rate of a particular population group and N the total population of a particular group for computing the rate. Critical ratios were used to examine the significant differences of age-adjusted rates between two population groups.2

RESULTS
The total study population was comprised of approximately 34 million persons, 13% of whom reported work-limiting chronic conditions (Table 1). Higher prevalence rates of morbidity were likely to be found in (1) aged persons, (2) those with low SES levels, (3) rural-to-rural migrants, (4) nonwhites, and (5) those with consistent statuses.

status patterns was made using migrantresidence status as a control factor (Table 4). A substantial difference in the prevalence rate of morbidity was still persistent between the two SES levels. The results were again summarized in a matrix table, indicating different risks in having higher morbidity rates among the four status patterns within a particular migrantresidence group. These four status patterns were ranked in ascending order. There was an inverse relationship between status level and relative risk of morbidity among all except urban-to-rural migrants. The same inverse relationship existed among rural nonmigrants, but not among urban DOnmigrants. The critical ratio in examining the significant difference between two rates for two SES levels shows that the

value is above the 5% level of significance (Tables 4 and 5).
CONCLUSIONS
The results of this analysis support the general postulate that morbidity differentials are greater in the low than in the high SES levels. The expected differences for migrants and nonmigrants were not very striking. Somewhat as expected, SES levels played a significant role in determining morbidity differentials, irrespective of status inconsistency and migration status. Considerable differences according to SES levels still existed after the age effect was partialed out. However, such status differences in morbidity distributions did not generally exist among urban-to-rural migrants; high SES migrants had higher

morbidity rates than those of low SES levels in the inconsistent status group. This finding indicates that there are interactive effects between status patterns and urban-to-rural migrants on morbidity.
The results of this study seem to imply that differential exposure to social etiological factors, mainly sociogenic sources of stress, may account for significant proportions of the differences in the health conditions of the populations. An individual exposed to more than one possible etiological factor in his life experience has a relatively greater morbidity risk than the sum

of the risks of individuals each exposed to one factor alone. The foregoing discussion pointing to the complexity of the relations between social factors and illness is not intended to derive a highly powerful predictability of ill health by social factors; rather, it is to explicate the possible social etiological linkage between social structure and illness.
In conclusion, a crucial question needs to be answered: Do the synergistic effects of social factors on work-limiting morbidity reflect (1) the differences in utilization of medical care and services or (2) the cumu-

lative and chronic impact of sodopathogenic factors on ill health? The answers to this question should prove helpful in the planning of social and welfare policies to promote health programs, since preventive programs for chronic illnesses may then focus upon uncovering and minimizing social etiological factors associated with disease.
In summary, this study has attempted to contribute to the further understanding of the social epidemiology of morbidity and the sociogenic factors leading to it. Perhaps it will stimulate more research in utilizing demographic data in the identification of the social risk factors in the course of illness. Using this approach, preventive programs might be developed which would lead to the control and reduction of morbidity.
