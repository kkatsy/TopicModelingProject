Some Characteristics of the Migration of Blacks in the United States

It is well known that for a long time black people have been leaving the rural South. It is equally well known that these people have been going to cities, not only outside the South, but within the South as well (Farley, 1968). The black population is still redistributing itself within the United States. Yet it has become evident that this migration is more inclusive and complex than mere exodus from the rural South.
At the same time, it has come to be widely believed that migration of blacks is a cause, or at least a major correlate, of important social problems. This nexus between migration of blacks and social problems is embodied in a series of myths that now constitute part of the popular racial heritage. For example, it is widely believed that the black communities of big cities grow relentlessly by in-migration of young, low-status blacks from the South's farming areas. This pressure of black in-migration is popularly seen as the prime or at least a leading cause of racial polarization and violence (Lubell, 1970).
The following discussion will examine briefly (and perforce superficially) some

trends of the migration of blacks within the United States in recent years. The analysis is based on recent census data and will be organized around the following issues: (1) growth, (2) inter-regional migration, (3) urbanization, and (4) selectivity. The focus of analysis is on trends, although some attention is of necessity given to the current pattern. In the course of this analysis some data and findings will be presented that tend to challenge widespread beliefs about the migration of blacks.
The findings presented below are subject to several limitations. First, no data from the 1970 census relating to migration of blacks are yet available. Data for all years after 1960, therefore, are based on sample studies or estimates and may therefore involve varying degrees of inaccuracy when generalized. Second, for the same reason, data for years after 1960 are limited in both amount and detail. It has therefore been impossible to examine or to verify migration trends in relation to some specifics or details. This limitation is especially pronounced in the case of the selectivity trends.

In the forty years after 1900the black population grew by almost one-half, 46.6%. This was an annual rate of increase of slightly over 1.1%.However, as Table 1 indicates, the rate of growth increased markedly in the twodecades between 1940 and 1960. In the 1940-50 decade, the average annual rate of growth was about 1.6% while between 1950 and 1960 itwas 2.5%. In the decade of the 1960's both the amount and rate of increase of the black population declined. Decline of the rate of increase was impressive, from 2.5 to just under 1.9%.
The black population has not only increased throughout the twentieth century; it has also moved around within the territory of the United States. Some of the

It is seen that during the thirty years, 1940 to 1969, blacks as a per cent of the total population of the South declined from 24% to 19%. At the same time, the proportion of blacks residing in the South declined from three-fourths, 77%, to over one-half, 52%. To put the matter another way, while the national black population was increasing at an average annual rate of 2.5% between 1950 and 1960, in the South the rate was 1.1%; and between 1940 and 1950 the respective rates were 1.6% and 0.33% (Hamilton, 1970, Table 6, p. 19).

population sector in the other regions. Thus Table 2 shows that between 1940 and 1969 although the percentages remained relatively small, the proportions of blacks in the populations of the other regions doubled or better. At the same time, the proportion of blacks living in these regions increased markedly, doubling in the Northeast and North Central regions and growing from 1 to Ifo in the West.
Although the numbers involved were relatively small, as revealed by both measures, growth of the black population in the West was explosive in the three decades under consideration. It seems likely that this trend can be expected to continue in the foreseeable future. It will be shown in a later place that the growth of population in all regions did not result exclusively from migration.

Some data are available to show the amount and direction of interregional migration. These data are shown in Table 3. This table shows that between 1969 and 1970, the South lost 197,000 migrants to other regions and at the same time received 97,000 in-migrants. Thus, this region experienced a net loss of 100,000 blacks.
A net out-migration of 100,000 represents a reversal of the long-time trend. Thus, between 1940 and 1950 the region experienced an average annual net outmigration of blacks and other races of 159,700 (U.S. Bureau of theCensus, 1969). Between 1950 and 1960 the average was 145,700, and between 1960 and 1969 it had declined to 88,300.
Table 3 also shows that, with the exception of the North Central and the West, the regions produced most of their

Table 3 also shows where in-migrants to the various regions originated. Most black in-migrants to the Northeast, North Central region, and West came from the South, thus again confirming the long-time migration pattern. Most in-migrants to the South, however, came from the Northeast.
URBANIZATION
The major target for black migrants in the United States is the city. As a consequence, for a long time the rural sector has been declining and the urban proportion has been growing. The consequence of this trend is shown in the figures in Table 4. It will be seen that of the thirty largest cities, taken in 1967, the black proportion had increased steadily, sometimes even dramatically, throughout the seventeen-year period after 1950. In only four cities-- Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, and San Diego--the proportion of blacks either declined, remained constant, or grew only very slightly. On the other hand, the percentage of blacks doubled or almost doubled in fifteen cities. In the remaining eleven cities the proportion of blacks in the general population showed a steady and significant increase throughout the period under consideration.1
It has often been assumed that the urban black population grows principally by migration from rural and other nonurban places. Recent data, however, fail to support this belief. A 1969 census report (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969)
1 The evidence suggests that the rate of urban growth has been declining since 1960. In this connection, see Valien, 1970.

comments on this fact in the following
way.
Most of the estimated 2.6 million increase since 1960 in the Negro population in central cities is due to the natural increase of the population--that is, the excess of births over deaths. About one-third of the net gain --approximately 800,000 persons--is due to net in-migration. The decline in the white population of central cities, on the other hand, implies a substantial net out-migration of the white population during this period.
This picture of the relationship between
in-migration and natural increase in the
growth of the black metropolitan popula-
tion is shown in Table 5. It is seen that at

both computation periods, natural increase was the main source of new central-city black population. In the 1960-64 halfdecade, 5"5.9% of new central-city blacks were born in the metropolitan area, while in the second, five-year period, 1964-69, 77.1% were central-city natives. Thus the proportion of central-city in-migrants declined from 44.1 to 22.9%.
The picture of the migrant and natural-increase mix outside the central city was even more dramatic. In the 1960-64 half-decade this part of the metropolitan area experienced a net loss of blacks by migration, Thus all of the growth resulted from natural increase. In the next computation

period, 1964-69, three-fifths, 60% of the increase of blacks outside central cities resulted from natural increase. In other words, only 40% of the growth of this sector of the metropolitan black population resulted from migration.
One consequence of this relationship between migration and natural increase in the metropolitan black population was alteration of the age structure. Big-city blacks tended to become not only more "native"; they also tended to become younger. This trend is shown in the figures of Table 6. A cursory glance at this table shows that in the central cities of all metropolitan areas and at each date over

half the black residents were under 25 years of age. Persons under 16 years of age increased from 20 to 28% of the total black population of central cities between 1960 and 1969. On the other hand, black individuals between 25 and 64 years of age, the main work force, increased from only 15 to 19% of total central city population.
The growth of the youthful sector of the black population was even more phenomenal in metropolitan areas of one million and more. This sector grew from 23% in 1960 to 35% of the total in 1969. This fact not only reflects natural increase of the black population, but also reflects loss of the reproductive and youthful white population in the central cities of these metropolitan areas. At the same time, in these cities in 1969 the proportion of blacks in the total population under 16 years (35%), was more than three times as large as that among those 65 years old and over (11%).
The concentration of the black population within younger age brackets is also revealed in the smaller metropolitan areas, although this concentration is not sharp. It is noteworthy that the proportion of older persons, those over 65 years, tended to remain relatively small, ranging from 8 to 11% for all dates and in areas of all size. One result of this age structure is that the burden of support upon the persons in the work force tended to be large and increasing.
SELECTIVITY
It is evident that migrants tend to be selected in some way; for example, young children and older persons are less likely to move than adolescents and young adults. The selective characteristics of the black migrants evidently have important consequences for both the place of origin and for the receiving community. Although

the dimensions of variable selectivity of black migration seem to be well known, specific data to support such judgments are not always available.
The principal general image of black migration is related to the socioeconomic character of the migrants. In reference to this assumption, Karl and Alma Taeuber (1969, p. 126) asserted: "Contradictory expectations confronted us prior to our analysis of the characteristics of Negro migrants." On the one hand, it is widely believed that whites abandon large cities to low-status black rural and semi-rural in-migrants who increase the burden upon schools, welfare services, the police, and other public agencies. On the other hand, the Taeubers point out that demographic research has generally shown that higherstatus sectors of the population are the most residentially mobile. The available evidence tends to support these preconceptions only in part.
Referring to their analysis of the data, the Taeubers (1969, p. 134) declare: "As compared to non-migrants the black inmigrants are younger, better educated, and more likely to be employed in whitecollar occupations; and the ratio of males to females is similar." As the foregoing census data have indicated, two subgroups of migrants can be distinguished; those moving from one urban area to another, and those of nonurban origin. These subgroups of migrants vary significantly in characteristics.
The data show that in-migrants to metropolitan areas from nonmetropolitan places tend to be lower in educational and occupational status than migrants between metropolitan areas, but rather similar to metropolitan nonmigrants. Nevertheless, Daniel Price (1970, p. 47) has observed that black migrants from the rural South tend to be selected from the better educated members of the population. Thus he

Vol. 18, No. 4

Migration of Blacks

writes: "Following 1950, a high rate of out-migration of college-educated blacks from Southern areas is seen. However, even though the outmigrant blacks from Southern rural areas are in general better educated than the nonmigrants living in these areas, their level of education is not sufficiently high to increase the educational level of blacks in urban areas." For example, Irene Taeuber (1968) showed that although 24% of the resident black population of Boston in 1960 had less than an eighth-grade education, 29% of the nonmetropolitan in-migrants between 1955 and 1960 had this amount of education. On the other hand, the evidence indicates that migrants between metropolitan areas tend to reflect higher educational achievements than both migrants from nonmetropolitan sources and metropolitan nonmigrants. That is, although migrants from both nonmetropolitan and metropolitan sources tend to be better educated than nonmigrants in these two places of origin, by comparison with black residents in the cities of destination, nonmetropolitan migrants are less well educated and metropolitan migrants are better educated than the people they join in the big cities.
In respect to the age factor, the Taeubers (1969, p. 136) write, "in-migrants of nonmetropolitan origin are generally much younger than non-migrants or in-migrants from the SMSA's." At the same time, out-migrants from metropolitan areas tend to be both young and predominantly male. Daniel Price (1970, p. 54) found age selectivity of black out-migrants from the rural South to urban places was associated with both the resultant structure of the black population and with the economic status of the group. The Taeubers (1969) found that youthfulness and high education of metropolitan in-migrants were correlated. Thus, they state that "since young people have generally higher average

levels of educational attainment, it is possible that the younger age of the inmigrants is responsible for their higher educational level relative to non-migrants."
The studies of black migration tend to reveal that sex ratios of migrants resemble sex ratios of the receiving populations. While in-migrants to metropolitan areas often include many females, out-migrants from such areas are most often predominantly male. Such sex patterns of migration function to maintain the sex ratios of the receiving communities while altering those in the locations of origin, especially the rural South.
Finally, it has been found that migrants are more likely than nonmigrants to be engaged in white-collar occupations. This finding is supported by two facts. On the one hand, nonmigrants tend to be either rural Southern residents or urban centralcity persons. Both these categories of blacks are typically not white-collar workers. On the other hand, it has been shown that black out-migrants, from both nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas, are among the better-educated persons in those localities. They are therefore more likely than metropolitan residents to be able to qualify for white-collar occupations.
The Taeubers (1969) venture several inferences regarding the effects of the volume and character of black migration upon metropolitan areas. First, they observe that although the total volume of movement may be great, net migration is relatively small in reference to total migration and to the resident populations of the receiving areas. As a consequence, the impact of migration, whether favorable or unfavorable, is likely to be limited. Second, in the case of nonmetropolitan migrants, selectivity seems to have a deleterious effect on both the originating and the receiving communities. However, persons leaving one metropolitan area and moving

366

to another arelikely to have a beneficent effect upon the educational and occupational situation of the receiving locality. Third, the concentration of migrants in the younger age brackets tends to augment the working-age sector of receiving populations while at thesame time augmenting the dependent nonmigrant sector, especially in the rural South.
SUMMARY
Our data showed that although the black population has continued to increase throughout the present century, the rate of growth varied, peaking in the 1950-60 decade at about 2.5% per annum and declining thereafter. Growth of the black population was revealed in all regions, although at variable rates. All regions gained black population by in-migration. Only the South experienced a net loss of black population from out-migration to other regions. All regions gained black population from the South.

The proportion of blacks residing in cities of all sizes, andespecially In metropolitan areas, continued to grow, though at varying and declining rates. Asa consequence, by 1967blacks constituted over half thepopulation of one city and almost half in several others. The proportion of blacks in the center cities of metropolitan areas increased more from natural increase than from in-migration, and the rate of in-migration wason the decline. The youngest sectors of the central-city black populations of the largest metropolitan areas tended to grow fastest, mainly, it seems reasonable to conclude, from natural increase.
As compared to both nonmetropolitan and metropolitan nonmigrants, black inmigrants were found to be younger, better educated, and more likely to be employed in white-collar occupations. However, the ratio of males to females tended to be similar inboth the migrant and nonmigrant populations.
