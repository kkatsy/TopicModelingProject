ABSTRACT: This paper reports on the decision-making process leading to the choice of a particular contraceptive method. Specifically, a model was developed and tested which determines the choice between the IUD and the pill using data obtained from the 1969 Profamilia family planning program adopter's questionnaires in Bogotá, Colombia. A linear probability model was employed to estimate the effects of the independent variables on the probability of adopting the IUD over the pill. Briefly, income, education, parity level, and age were found to be significant while a spacing/limiting variable was not significant.

In matters concerning family size, a family unit may be said to be confronted with from one to three basic decisions. First, the family must decide whether or not to space and/or limit children. Secondly, if it decides to space and/or limit, the family must then decide what method will be employed to achieve this end. Finally, the family must decide, on a periodic basis, whether or not it will continue with the method chosen.
The purpose of this paper is to report on research which focuses on the decision regarding which method or combination of methods will be employed by the family unit in its attempt to effectively constrain fertility outcomes to desired levels and birth intervals. Specifically, when a family decides to plan its fertility, it is confronted with a number of possible methods, including the IUD, oral pill, rhythm, withdrawal, condoms, foams, diaphragms, douche, jelly, sterilization, injections, etc. Thus, there are a number of methods from which to choose, and different families will, if unconstrained, choose among these methods. The relevant question is: What

criteria go into the process of deciding which method to use? Certainly, physiological considerations may limit certain individuals to particular methods. For example, young nonparous women may not be able to tolerate an IUD (Medawar and Pyke, 1971). However, there does appear to be a decision-making process in this regard over and above the effect of physiological constraints. In this paper we focus on this contraceptive choice, using data from Bogotá, Colombia.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH
There has been little previous work done in the area of modeling of contraceptive choice, even though such eminent demographers as Berelson and Campbell (1971) have noted the desirability of such work. There have been some studies of the characteristics of users of various methods; but these works concentrated on the broad characteristics of adopters of various methods and little attempt was made to develop a theory of contraceptive choice (see, for example, Freedman et al., 19S9;

Whelpton et al., 1966; Ryder and Westoff, 1971; Rainwater, 1965).
Beyond these descriptive studies, a few attempts have been made to study a behavioral relationship in contraceptive choice, including studies by Cochrane (1975), Bauman and Varavej (1972), and Ballweg (1972). Cochrane employed a multivariate discriminant analysis in an attempt to analyze the characteristics which maximize the prediction of a woman as an IUD versus pill user. The sample was composed of 450 OEOsponsored Planned Parenthood clinic participants in Columbia, South Carolina, including 130 IUD acceptors and 292 pill acceptors. Briefly, it was found that race, previous type of contraceptive used, and number of children lost were the most significant variables. Cochrane also found that income and education were not important variables. This latter finding perhaps resulted from the nature of the sample.

ables" and that the process of this choice has implications for continuation rates.
Ballweg (1972) studied 3,445 national family planning program subjects in the Philippines who had adopted the pill, IUD, rhythm, or other method. Basically, this study was an attempt to examine sources of information on family planning, status, education of the wife, husband's occupation, actual fertility, and desired fertility as they affect contraceptive method choice. Ballweg found that women near the end of childbearing years were more likely to select one of the more effective methods as also were women with large families who desire no more children. In addition, two measures of status, education and occupation of the husband, failed to reveal significant relationships with choice of method. Simple analysis of variance was used to test the hypotheses, although it appears that a more powerful statistical procedure would have been preferable in this case.

The study by Bauman and Varavej (1972) examined the choice between the IUD and the pill and the implications of the nature of this choice on continuation rates. Their sample consisted of 5,669 women who had adopted either the pill or the IUD in a hospital in Bangkok and 179 women from Soongnern Clinic in northeastern Thailand. Their central hypothesis was that spacers would choose the pill and limiters the IUD and that this process tends to artificially lower the continuation rate for the pill. Their actual data analysis was limited, including simple two-way contingency tables and resulting chisquare statistics. However, their hypothesis was supported by their tests in each of the two samples. Of central interest here, though, is not the results of their data analysis but rather their underlying thesis that women do not randomly choose among available contraceptive methods but rather base choice on "selected vari-

MATERIALS AND METHODS
MODEL SPECIFICATION
Contraception can be thought of as a consumer good with both quantitative and qualitative dimensions. Further, there are two dimensions to the qualitative nature of contraceptives. First, there is an effectiveness dimension. Even assuming all methods are used with maximum efficiency, different methods will still yield different levels of protection from conception. Second, there is a demand dimension. Budgets and tastes are not constant among different individuals. In order to minimize complications posed by the first of these two dimensions (differences in effectiveness), this study focuses on the choice between the IUD and the oral pill, since both of these methods have high effectiveness ratings.
It should be emphasized that it is possi-

least squares (OLS) violates the assumption of constant variance (homoskedasticity). We therefore employ a two-stage procedure in which the model is first estimated using OLS, thus obtaining estimated values of the dependent variable. A weight is then calculated based on the estimated values of the dependent variable which is used multiplicably to transform all of the variables included in the original model as described by Goldberger (Goldberger, 1964) p. 249; see also McGillivary,

were recalculated based on the transformed variables which yielded generalized least squares (GLS) estimates for the parameters and corrected for the heteroskedasticity problem.
Other methods of estimation are possible for this type of problem, none of which are without problems. The method used here can only be relied upon asymptotically. That is, the results would not be reliable for small samples though it is generally reliable for large sample cases such as this one (Nerlove and Press, 1975, pp. 50-55). Furthermore, the multiple R2 and the subsequent Snedecor F-test have no meaning in this case (Nerlove and Press, 1975, p. 54). However, the multiple R2 resulting from OLS estimation in the presence of heteroskedasticity also has no meaning (Hu, 1971). Thus, these summary statistics from regression are not reported so as to avoid confusion.
Table 3 presents the estimated equation for the model, after estimating permanent income (the instrument variable mentioned earlier) and after correcting for the problem of heteroskedasticity. The results of the estimation of the instrumental variable, income, are:

Table 3 also shows the results from the first-stage, or uncorrected, model. The estimated equations are essentially the same, with only a slight change in coefficient values. It is also seen in Table 3 that all of the variables display the expected signs, and all but one are significant at the 5 per cent level, two-tailed test. In terms of relative importance, the standardized regression coefficients indicate that the interaction variables (number of living children, wife's age, and number of children times wife's age) are the "best" regressors.
Turning to an interpretation of the equation, notice the overall predominance of the IUD as reflected in the high values for the constant term. The other coefficients, such as that attaching to W Ed, are interpreted as follows: A woman who has completed secondary school has a
5 per cent greater probability of choosing the pill over the IUD as compared to an illiterate, holding all else constant (found by multiplying 4, which is equivalent to a secondary school graduate, by the coefficient on wife's education).
Income is also a significant explanatory

variable for choice. However, it should be noted that the coefficient is rather small. In the case of this variable, increasing income from 500 pesos to 1,000 pesos will decrease the probability of opting for the IUD, as opposed to the pill, by 3.0 per cent.
Concerning the intercept constant, it was hypothesized that this coefficient should equal 0.86, whereas the results yield an intercept of 0.8205 with a standard error of 0.0408. To determine whether or not the hypothesis is supported by the results, a Student-i statistic can be calculated as follows:
t = p ^ g g = °-968.
This value is not significant at the 20 per cent level; therefore, the null hypothesis that the estimated constant is effectively the same as the hypothesized constant cannot be rejected. Rephrasing this in a positive manner, the results support the hypothesis that the intercept constant is basically determined by the relative prices.
To examine the effect of the important interaction variables more closely, a table was constructed of the expected probabilities of choosing the IUD, holding all other variables constant at their means, and allowing wife' age and number of living children to vary over a relevant

range of values. Referring to Table 4, observe that as wife's age and number of children increase, the probability of choosing the IUD increases, as expected. In addition, the proportional increase in the probability of opting for the IUD for younger women as number of children is increased is greater than it is for older women, indicating a crisis orientation for younger women with three or more children. That is, they are highly motivated to reduce fertility and the IUD is perceived as the best means to accomplish this end.
Finally, note that while the sign of the coefficient attaching to the limiting/ spacing variable is consistent with our hypothesis, the estimated partial effect of this variable turns out to be not significantly different from no effect at all. This finding may be attributed to multicollinearity or to a lack of systematic relationship between this variable and type of method chosen.

the adopter. The relationship between the prices of the two methods also appears to have an influence. This influence of the relationship between the prices of the methods suggests that the relative prices are a policy variable which family planning clinics may employ if they wish to change the proportions of people adopting the various methods, though a strong conclusion on this point should await an experiment of such a change.
In terms of usefulness, a model of this type may be employed by family planning clinics as an aid to channeling potential adopters into the methods they might adopt. In addition, this type of analysis may be useful as a basis for marketing strategies for contraceptives. Before implementation for such uses, however, the analysis should be expanded to include more types of contraceptives and should be tested on additional samples.

CONCLUSION
This study has had the aim of examining the choice process between only two contraceptive techniques in a restricted environment. From the results it appears that people make decisions concerning which contraceptive technique to adopt at least partially on the basis of income, status-determined values, information, and relevant life-cycle characteristics of
