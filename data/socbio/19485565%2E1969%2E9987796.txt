Variation in the duration of exposure to the risk of childbirth was introduced by varying the age at marriage or at sterility.

obtained in surveys of married women, classified by age as well as planning status (i.e., ever-planners or never-planners up to the time of the survey), we attempted to simulate such data. The present computer program tabulates women by family-planning status only at the end of the simulated history. Therefore, the reproductive history of each cohort, consisting of 1,000 women, was simulated independently four times, starting at age 15 but ending at different ages. Results at ages 25, 30, 35, and 40 were obtained.
To demonstrate more clearly the effects of varying the experimental factors, we

Contraceptive effectiveness increased from 50% at parity three to 90% at parity seven and above. As will be seen in the simulated data, this relatively low effectiveness resulted in an average achieved parity appreciably higher than the average desired family size.
A factorial design was used, each of two factors (age at marriage and sterility) being assumed to operate independently at two levels. The variations yielded four different types of cohorts which are designated by number. For two cohort types, 590 and 592, age at marriage was a constant (exact age 20).2 For the remaining two, 591 and

Thus, for each simulated cohort, identical assumptions were made regarding the level of fetal loss, infant mortality, and lengths of the nonsusceptible periods associated with pregnancy.1 Natural fecundability was 0.10 for all women at all ages. Since the aim was to simulate survey-type data on surviving

mean of 20.0 years and a standard deviation of 3.0 years. In both cases, all women married. In two of the cohort types, 590 and 591, no sterility occurred before age 40. In the other two, 592 and 594, age at onset of sterility was variable (Henry, 1935). The expected percentages of married and of sterile women in the cohort types where these factors were varied are given in Table 2.

RESULTS
Table 3 presents results for the four simulated cohorts at age 35. In each cohort, nonplanners exhibit lower natality than planners. The natality of planners remains almost constant between cohorts, while the natality of nonplanners fluctuates in response to the experimental conditions. Consequently, the magnitude of the differentials between planners and nonplanners depends on how the experimental factors affect the natality of nonplanners.
Before becoming planners, all women in Cohort 590 are exposed to the same probabilities of the various events. All women marry at exact age 20 and remain fecund throughout the period of observation. All have the same constant fecundability, identical probabilities of fetal loss and infant mortality, and identical distributions of the nonsusceptible periods associated with pregnancy. Thus, the only variation between planners and nonplanners is in the chance

factors affecting the components of the intervals between births, yet, planners, despite the use of contraceptives, have more live births--an average of 4.2 as compared with 3.6 for nonplanners. The explanation for this differential is implicit in the cumulative parity distributions. For example, 9.9% of nonplanners have three or fewer births, while planners all have at least four births. Some women fail to achieve their desired family size and hence do not become planners. Stated another way, women who through the operation of chance alone, attain high parities are selected as family planners.
When a variable age at marriage is introduced, as in Cohort 591, the natality differential between planners and nonplanners is double that observed when chance alone operates (1.2 vs. 0.6). The planners here have 4.4 live births on the average, while the nonplanners have only 3.2. Clearly, the planners are now selected on the basis of having a longer marital duration than in Cohort 590, while the nonplanners have a shorter marital duration.
At this simulated age of 35 years, the natality of planners in a cohort with sterility (592) is the same as in Cohort 590. Sterility does, however, reduce the natality of nonplanners to 2.9 births. When sterility and a variable age at marriage are combined (594), planners again have an average of 4.4 births as in Cohort 591, while the average is decreased to 2.8 for nonplanners. The interaction between these two factors to some degree offsets the pure effects of each.
The experimental factors also strikingly affect variability in the number of births. For each cohort, planners have a standard deviation of 0.8 or 0.9, giving a coefficient of variation of 19% to 20%. In contrast, the natality of nonplanners is more variable in every cohort. The variation increases with the introduction of a variable age at marriage, and more markedly when sterility is introduced. This is due to the increased incidence of parities of two or fewer among

nonplanners, as seen in the cumulative parity distribution.
At age 40, the experimental factors also affect the cumulative parity distributions of planners (data not shown). Thus, 25% of planners have four or fewer live births in Cohort 590, but the percentage increases to 29% in Cohort 591, to 3 1 % in Cohort 592, and to 35% in Cohort 594. However, the

mean number of live births is still the same in all cohorts (4.9 or 5.0).
It is of interest to note that the relative homogeneity of natality behavior observed among family planners in these simulations has also been observed in real data. While our results reflect the low variation in desired family size assumed in these experiments, they do suggest that in the presence of relatively invariant desired family size and effective contraceptive practice, little variation is to be expected in the natality of family planners.
Another aspect of the selection of planners is illustrated by the data in Table 4, which shows the number of women in each cohort type who are planners at specified ages. Each of the experimental factors depresses to a greater or lesser extent the number of women in the cohorts who have become planners by age 40. While a variable age at marriage (Cohort 591) increases the number that have become planners by age 25 and even more so by age 30, slight de-

The effects of these factors on the cohort types previously discussed are further illustrated in Table 5, which presents the natality differentials obtained at different ages. Theeffect of chance variation in birth intervals alone (Cohort 590) produces a differential of 0.8 in the mean natality of planners and nonplanners at age 30. This differential is reduced (by a fourth) at the older ages. The addition of a variable age at marriage (Cohort 591) produces a large

CONCLUSIONS
Our results support the hypothesis that sterility is not the only factor contributing to thelow natality of nonplanners. Any factor, including chance variation, which acts to depress the natality of some women, has a role in theselection of family plannersand hence in the natality difference between planners and nonplanners. With the rather simple assumptions used here, the factors studied have effects at each simulated age, but their relative importance changes with age. Therefore, it is to be expected that in survey data differentials might be produced at any age by a variety of causes. Thus, it may be erroneous to attribute observed differentials entirely to the sterility or subfecundity of nonplanners.
