ABSTRACT: This exploratory analysis of factors associated with Chinese women's fertility desires uses data on married women between the ages of 18 and 35 who live in Shaanxi Province, China. Analyses using an economic framework found that both rural and urban couples who intended to sign, or who had already signed, the one-child certificate reported wanting significantly fewer children. However, in rural areas (where 80 per cent of the provincial population lives), education level, living arrangements, participation in an arranged marriage, attitudes regarding the ideal age for marriage, and knowledge of the reasons for the government's fertility policies appear to play a relatively larger role in shaping fertility preferences.

By virtually all accounts, China's family planning policies worked in combination with socioeconomic development to reduce fertility rates up through the mid 1980's. However, since 1984, China's crude birth rate has risen (State Statistical Bureau, 1988). Zeng et al. (1991) demonstrate that much of this recent increase can be attributed to a shift toward a younger age at first marriage and an increase in the proportion of women in the peak reproductive years. But even once they control for these factors, they find that fertility rates have increased during the latter part of the 1980's.
Opinions regarding desired family size are the antecedents of fertility behavior. Indeed, some scholars argue that if family planning policies are to have further impact on rural fertility rates, they must not only provide education and access to appropriate family planning techniques, but they must also encourage changes in the population's attitudes about the ideal family

size (Whyte and Gu, 1987, p. 472; Peng, 1989, p. 6). If Chinese couples' fertility decisions are to move more in sync with the government's goal of reducing fertility, the catalyst behind the change must be a shift in fertility desires. As a consequence, it becomes important to understand the factors that influence attitudes about desired family size.
This paper presents an exploratory analysis of factors associated with Chinese women's fertility desires using data on married women between the ages of 18 and 35 who live in Shaanxi Province, China.1 The primary assumption underlying this investigation is that the political, cultural, and socioeconomic environments in which couples live, play important roles in the
1In 1990, Shaanxi's crude birth rate was 23.49, placing it considerably above the average of 20.98 for the country as a whole (Zeng et al., 1991). Thus, while analysis of Shaanxi Province may not generalize to the rest of the country, it will provide insights about the correlates of fertility desires in high fertility provinces.

Although desired family size and fertility behavior are not synonymous, they are closely related. Fertility follow-up surveys in Taiwan and Thailand (Hermalin et al., 1979;Knodel and Prochuabmoh, 1973) reveal that expressed attitudes are generally consistent with subsequent behavior.2 Hence, this review draws on both literatures to help lay the background for the current analyses.

The Chinese government's direct attempts at influencing couples' fertility choices began almost three decades ago when the government established noncompulsory family planning programs in urban areas of the country. In 1971, the government became more aggressive, establishing the Wan, Xi, Shao program. This program sought to encourage couples to marry later, increase the spacing between children, and have fewer children, with the ultimate goal being that couples would limit their families to two children.

additional educational and health care benefits for their only child. Parents who have accepted the one-child certificate but who choose to have a second child must repay the benefits they have received, and they may also be subject to certain punishments (e.g., confiscation of a family's large durables) (Dalsimer and Nisonoff, 1987; Whyte and Gu, 1987). This policy encountered increasing international criticism and domestic opposition, and as a result the government revised some of the regulations in 1984 (Greenhalgh, 1986). For example, rural couples are now allowed to have two children without receiving any economic or social sanctions, particularly if the first child is a girl (Arnold and Liu, 1986; Whyte and Gu, 1987). Moreover, local cadres are now banned from being coercive in enforcing the one-child policy (Greenhalgh, 1986).
Although the one-child certificate is the cornerstone of China's family planning efforts, there are complementary policies that indirectly serve to alter couples' fertility choices. In particular, the 1980 Marriage Law proclaimed that spouses must practice family planning, and it also raised the legal age of marriage by two years for both men and women. In some instances, even if both parties are above the legal age, local family planning officials can pressure a couple to delay their marriage (Yang, 1987). As Engle (1984, p. 958) points out, "late marriage and late childbirth are critical elements in China's efforts to control population growth." Work by Zeng et al. (1991) also affirms this point.
Assessments of the government's family planning programs generally conclude that although the policies

have been effective, they have had a greater impact on urban fertility than on rural fertility (Coale, 1989; Lavely and Freedman, 1990; Poston, 1988; Peng, 1989;Yang, 1987). That is, while the total fertility rate (TFR) fell in both urban and rural areas during the early 1980's, it remained consistently higher in the countryside than in urban areas. Since approximately 80 per cent of China's population lives in the countryside, this rural/urban fertility differential is of particular concern for the government. Some scholars argue that it may simply take more time for the rural fertility rate to decline to the urban level (Coale and Chen, 1987). Yet, it may be that the strong influence of traditional family values in rural areas will inhibit the continued decline of rural fertility for years to come.
TRADITIONAL FAMILY VALUES
The body of research on the correlates of family size in China provide several insights about how family values may influence fertility. At a macro level, it is often noted that fertility rates vary from province to province. While some of this variation is attributable to differences in provincial family planning programs (Poston, 1988; Poston and Gu, 1987), some of the variation may also be a function of ethnic mix, since couples of varying ethnicities hold differing family values regarding family size (Whyte and Gu, 1987; Peng, 1989).
At a more micro level, studies note that there is a long-standing link between fertility rates and occupation, with parents who work in traditional, agricultural occupations having larger families than those who work in other

industries. This cultural link between agriculture and large families has been reinforced in rural areas by the government's recent agricultural policies. During the 1980's, the Chinese government introduced the "family responsibility system" in rural areas (Dalsimer and Nisonoff, 1987). Under this system, a plot of land is assigned to an individual household rather than to a larger collective unit. As a consequence, rural couples' desires for more children--particularly male childrenare reinforced by the economic imperative to have children who can help work the land.
The cultural desirability of male children lies not merely in their greater physical strength for farm work, but also in their ability to bring additional labor power to the household through marriage. When a son marries, custom has it that he will continue to live in his parents' home with his new wife (i.e., patrilocal residence). By the same rule, a daughter typically moves away from her parents' home when she marries. As such, sons are also highly valued because they provide economic support for their parents as they grow older. This strong preference for sons often leads rural couples to have more than one child, especially if the first child is a female (Arnold and Zhaoxiang, 1986).
Other aspects of the traditional Chinese culture, besides the preference for male children, serve to promote large families. Specifically, there is a long history in China of arranged marriages taking place at early ages, particularly in the rural areas (Coale, 1989; Peng, 1989; Yang, 1987). Since virtually all childbearing takes place within the confines of marriage, these tradition-

ally arranged early marriages are typically associated with more births.
FAMILY'S ECONOMIC STATUS
Social demographers argue that traditional cultural influences on fertility typically wane as a society modernizes. In their place, socioeconomic factors, as measured by rising education and income levels, begin to exert an increasingly important influence on fertility. For the most part, the Chinese fertility literature is consistent with this view.
Rising levels of education appear to alter Chinese couples' fertility preferences and behavior (Cheng, 1988; Feeney et al., 1989; Hermalin and Liu, 1990; Lavely and Freedman, 1990; Peng, 1989; Yang, 1987; Zhang, 1984). Education may play several roles in reducing fertility. First, by increasing the productivity of women outside of the home, education creates an incentive for a woman to spend more time working and less time in child care (Hashimoto, 1970; Whyte and Parish, 1984). Second, education may affect the efficiency of fertility control by increasing a woman's knowledge and use of birth control and/or her understanding of the goals of the government's fertility policy (Lavely and Freedman, 1990; Michael, 1973; Yang, 1987). Finally, highly educated couples may have high educational expectations for their own children. In recognition that educational investments are costly, these same couples may adjust their fertility expectations. Indeed, Cheng's work (1988) provides support for this hypothesis, showing that the higher a couple's educational expectations for their child(ren), the fewer children they want to have.

There is some evidence that education's effect on fertility differs by where the couple lives in China. Hermalin and Liu (1990) find a significant inverse relationship between education and fertility preferences among urban couples but the evidence is much weaker among rural couples. One explanation for this result is that urban educated women are more suspect of a survey's confidentiality and therefore more likely to give a socially desirable response when asked about preferred family size (Hermalin and Liu, 1990, p. 351).
As with education, the relationship between income and fertility in China also appears to be complicated. A series of research papers from the EastWest Population Institute's Values of Children Project (Arnold et al., 1975) show that fertility declines in Southeast and East Asian countries are typically associated with reduced economic roles for children, and the emergence of the conjugal family. Some comparative studies (Bulatao, 1976; Lee and Kim, 1977) also note that the value of children in terms of expected economic help is generally inversely related to household income levels.
However, the few studies that have looked at the role of income in influencing Chinese couples' fertility do not always find an inverse relationship. Peng (1989) uses aggregate Chinese data to estimate fertility regressions for 1957, 1965, and 1978 and finds that income has a positive, significant impact on total fertility in 1957, but there is no relationship between the two in 1965 and 1978 (Peng, 1989, p. 26). In contrast, Zhang's (1984) research on the fertility preferences of Beijing youth, found a weak negative correlation be-

tween income and fertility preferences among unmarried subgroups. A more sophisticated analysis of married couples based on the same data revealed a significant negative relationship.
Finally, in the urban areas, there is also some indirect evidence that socioeconomic development has precipitated housing problems that may lessen couples' preferences for large families (Whyte and Parish, 1984; Peng, 1989). In many cities, serious housing shortages prevent many young couples from adhering to traditional patrilocal residence. Instead, newly married couples are often forced to reside with the wife's parents (i.e., matrilocal residence) or to find a place of their own. If a young couple cannot live with their inlaws, they may delay their marriage until they can obtain adequate housing which may reduce their fertility. If they live in a crowded, extended family situation, then their fertility decisions may be influenced by their inability to secure privacy. In contrast, the relationship between residential living arrangements and fertility may be less pronounced in rural areas where typically housing is not a problem (Tien and Lee, 1988).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE FRAMEWORK
Both family economists and family sociologists offer theories of fertility choice. Economists typically posit that the demand for children is a function of couples' tastes, household income, and market prices (Becker, 1981; Willis, 1974). In contrast, sociologists typically hypothesize that fertility decisions are influenced more by cultural

Vol. 41, No. 3-4

norms and values than by financial considerations (Duensenberry, 1960; Blake, 1968). Both economic and sociological considerations are incorporated into the work of Easterlin (1978) who argues that "demand for children is based on the household's balancing of its subjective tastes against externally determined constraints of price and income in a way that maximizes satisfaction" (p. 61). This premise along with the research reviewed above serve to guide the work that is done here.
In the simple version of the Easterlin model, couples' tastes influence their relative preferences for the two things from which they are assumed to gain satisfaction: children and "all other goods." For example, farm households may have a stronger preference for children (relative to other consumption options) than do nonfarm households because farming couples view children not only as a source of enjoyment but also as a productive asset.
One's relative preferences for children are balanced against the resource costs they impose. That is, parents must clothe and feed a child. They must also spend large amounts of time with a child--especially when they are young. The costs of having children are thus measured by the value of the time and money that could have been spent on the consumption of "all other goods." Thus, couples with strong preferences for children may still desire a small family if the resource cost of each child is high.
Unlike most economic models, Easterlin's thesis places couples' tastes on equal footing with income and prices in the determination of fertility

decisions. As such, his model is well suited for an investigation of fertility in China where there is evidence that tastes (as represented by traditional family values) play an important role. To set the stage for the current investigation, the hypothesized roles of prices, income, and tastes are each discussed as they relate to fertility desires in China.
1. Price.-- The price of children is reflected in direct expenditures, opportunities foregone by the parents, and any psychological costs associated with having a child. Under current Chinese policy, direct expenditures on a first child are reduced if a couple signs the one-child certificate. Couples who sign may get an added monthly stipend, preferred housing, and/or special education and health benefits for their only child. While the "price" of the first child is effectively reduced for these parents, the price of a second child is substantially higher because if they choose to have a second child, they must repay any government benefits they had received in return for their signing of the one-child certificate. Thus, because these couples face a steeper "price structure," it is anticipated that couples who have signed the one-child certificate will prefer smaller families than couples who have not chosen to sign the certificate.
The opportunity costs of having a child are typically measured in terms of the value of labor market activities that are foregone by spending time with a child. In most instances, these opportunity costs are measured by the woman's market wage rate because she is usually the one who devotes the most time to child care. However, in the absence of wage measures, education is

156

Zick and Xiang

often used as a proxy because it is highly correlated with wages. The prediction is that higher wages (education levels) will be associated with preferences for smaller families because higher women's wages (education levels) raise the opportunity costs of having children.
The psychic costs of having children are often the most difficult to measure. They include the stress and strain of taking on the responsibility of caring for a young child as well as any negative changes in parents' relationships with family, friends, and the community that may be precipitated by the birth of a child. Under the government's current family planning policies, Chinese couples may perceive the psychic costs of having larger families to be substantial, particularly in rural areas, where the local cadre may impose severe social sanctions. It is also hypothesized that couples will regard the psychic costs of having children to be higher when they live in an extended family situation.
2. Income.--In the general economic model, it is hypothesized that an increase in income will lead to an increase in the demand for all "normal" goods. In theory, this means that if children are a normal good, then as household income rises, so should the demand for children. In practice, the relationship between income and fertility is complicated by two measurement issues. First, Easterlin (1969; 1980) notes that expenditures on children are made over a number of years and thus, the relevant income measure is one that captures the household's income expectations over the life cycle. This is typically called "permanent income" (Friedman, 1955). In practice,

permanent income is difficult to measure, especially when the available data are cross-sectional, so researchers often resort to using current income. To compensate for using current income as a measure of permanent income, other indicators of the household's wealth over the life cycle may also be included in the estimation. These complementary indicators include measures of physical wealth (e.g., durable goods ownership) and human wealth (e.g., educational attainment).
Second, it is generally recognized that parents do not gain satisfaction from children per se, rather they gain satisfaction from happy, healthy children. To produce happy and healthy children, parents must purchase childrelated goods and services (e.g., food, clothing, and shelter for the child). Thus, when faced with an increase in income, a couple can increase the satisfaction they gain from their children in two ways. They may either choose to have another child and maintain a constant level of per-child expenditure, or they may choose to increase their perchild expenditure and to keep their family size constant. Thus, an increase in income will not necessarily lead to an increase in the number of children desired, even if children are seen by parents as a normal good.
3. Tastes. --The origins of Chinese society's outlook on children can be traced back to Confucius (551-479 B.C.), who argued that each family has an obligation to bear and rear children so that they might continue the family line and perform ancestral worship (Lang, 1946). Colloquial sayings such as "early marriage brings happiness of having sons" and "a son is the guaran-

tee of a secured old age" reinforce these traditional pronatalistic attitudes. When taken as a whole, it becomes clear that traditional Chinese society cultivates a strong preference for children, particularly male children, relative to all other goods.
Ideally, the impact of tastes should be captured by measuring couples' values directly. In practice, most data sets do not contain such measures and so researchers must search for potential proxies. For example, if a couple participated in an arranged marriage or if they lived with the husband's parents after marriage, then they could be classified as having traditional values. The expectation would then be that these "traditional" couples would be more inclined than their otherwise similar counterparts to express a desire for a large family.
DATA
The data for the analyses are taken from China's 1985 In-Depth Fertility Survey. The survey covered three geographical areas, Shaanxi Province, Hebei Province, and the Shanghai Municipality. Data from Shaanxi Province are used in the current analyses.3 One province is used in this study so that regional variations in economic development and cultural background can be held constant.
In the current study, the Shaanxi sample is restricted to those women who were married and age 35 or
3The survey instrument, modelled after the World Fertility Survey, is an in-person interviewdesigned to gather data on women's marriages, pregnancy histories, and contraceptive use. Stratified, multistage sampling was used to identify a representative sample of women between the ages of 15 and 49. The interview response rate was 96.1 per cent.

younger at the time of the interview. Age 35 is selected as the cut-off point because it is important to focus the analyses on those women who are most likely to be in the midst of making fertility decisions. Data from the early 1980's show that the fertility rate for Chinese women reaches a peak of 0.25 at around age 25 and then begins to decline, with the rate dropping to 0.01 for women in their mid 30s (Yi et al., 1985). These data suggest that even if a woman over age 35 expresses a desire for more children, she is unlikely to translate that desire into reality. For similar reasons, women who had been sterilized for reasons other than birth control are also excluded from the analyses. With these three restrictions in place, the original sample of 4,248 women is reduced to 2,370.
In the current analysis, the price of having children is captured by four different variables. These variables include (1) whether or not the respondent has signed or plans to sign the one-child certificate, (2) whether or not the respondent's marriage was delayed because of pressure from a local group, (3) whether or not the couple currently lives in an extended family, and (4) the woman's education level.4 It is hypothesized that women who signed (or intend to sign) the one-child certificate, delayed their marriage, or lived in an extended family will report that they want fewer children than otherwise comparable women, because all of these factors raise the direct and/ or psychic costs of having a child. In
4Initially, husband's education was also included in the model. However, preliminary analyses indicated that husband's and wife's education were highly correlated and thus husband's education was eliminated from the equation.

addition, it is hypothesized that education will be inversely related to desired family size because highly educated women have substantial opportunity costs associated with any time they spend in child care.
Income across the life cycle is proxied by four measures available in the Shaanxi data. Household income during the past twelve months is included as the standard, imperfect proxy for permanent income. In addition, a household technology index is included. This index measures the presence or absence of nine different types of technology in the respondent's home.5 A dummy variable that measures whether the husband works in agriculture is also included. It is hypothesized that couples involved in agricultural labor are more likely than otherwise similar couples to view children as a productive asset that enhances income over the life cycle. As a result, the women in these households should express a desire for large families. Finally, it is recognized that while the women's education measures the opportunity costs of the woman's time, it may also measure aspects of the household's permanent income.
Tastes are captured by the answers to five questions that provide some indication of how strongly traditional Chinese family values are held. The questions measure (1) whether the couple lived with the husband's parents immediately after marriage, (2) whether the marriage was arranged,
5This index is constructed as the sum of the positive responses to questions that asked if there was (1) running water, (2) electricity, (3) a bicycle, (4) a refrigerator, (5) a washing machine, (6) a radio, (7) a television, (8) a sewing machine, and (9) a clock in the respondent's house or building.

(3) whether the respondent could correctly identify the reason for the onechild policy, (4) the respondent's notion of the ideal age for marriage, and (5) the actual age difference between the wife and husband. It is hypothesized that these factors capture (albeit imperfectly) aspects of traditional cultural values that will influence desired family size.6
Finally, the dependent variable used in this analysis is constructed based on respondents' answers to a series of questions about future fertility intentions. A respondent was first asked if she Wanted to have another child at some time in the future. If the respondent answered yes to this question, then she was asked, "as things are today, how many children do you want altogether?" If a respondent or her husband was sterilized, she was omitted from this question sequence. Respondents who had been sterilized for birth control reasons and respondents who said they did not want another child are assigned their current family size as their desired family size. The answer to the "how many children do you want altogether" question is used as the measure of desired family size for all other respondents.
There is some debate in the fertility literature regarding the validity of questions that ask about how many children are wanted altogether (Hermalin and Liu, 1990; Lightbourne,
6Initially, age of the respondent was also included in the list of preference shifters. However, because of purposeful sample restrictions, age did not have a wide range of variation (i.e., everyone was between the ages of 20 and 35 in the sample). Furthermore, preliminary analyses indicated that the respondent's age was highly correlated with her reported ideal age for marriage and her education. As a consequence, the respondent's age was deleted from the final analysis.

1987; McClelland, 1983; Whyte and Gu, 1987). However, it has been demonstrated that respondents have little trouble giving "reasonable" answers to such questions. That is, the answers are almost always bounded suggesting that respondents incorporate information about income and time constraints when formulating their responses (McClelland, 1983, p. 305). Indeed, examinations of the question's validity and reliability generally conclude that desired family size is a relatively good measure of the demand for children at a point in time.7
An important caveat to note is that by using the responses to questions that were asked only of the wife, the current analysis presumes that the wife's response reflects the couples' demand. This may be a strong assumption. McClelland (1983) notes that in studies where husbands and wives are interviewed separately, spouses often disagree about desired family size (p. 301).
RESULTS
Table 1 reports the distributions of desired family size stratified by urban/ rural location and whether or not the couple already had children. Past research suggests that the relationships between prices, income, tastes, and desired family size vary by residential location and the presence or absence of children (Hermalin, and Liu, 1990; Whyte and Gu, 1987) and thus, separate analyses are conducted on these four groups to allow for the possibility of such interaction effects.
7 T h eone exception is the work of Hermalin and Liu (1990).

The figures reported in Table 1show that for each of the four groups, the modal response for desired family size is two children. This finding is consistent with Whyte and Gu's (1987) study of desired family size in Hubei Province (p. 476). However, these data differ somewhat from Whyte and Gu's in that the Shaanxi respondents are much more likely to express a desired family size of one or zero than were the Hubei respondents.
Despite their modal agreement on family size, there are some striking differences among the four groups. Women who are currently childless typically express a desire for a smaller number of children than do women who have at least one child, regardless of residential location. This difference may be an artifact of self-selection. That is, couples who have relatively strong preferences for children may be more likely to have children already than are couples whose relative preferences favor "all other goods" over children.
Table 1 also indicates that urban childless women are much more likely than their rural counterparts to report one child as their desired family size (28.4 per cent versus 5.5 per cent). Women who have at least one child and who live in rural areas express the greatest demand for children with more than one quarter (28.5 per cent) giving a desired family size of three. These urban/rural differences may reflect differences in the roles that price, income, and traditional cultural values play in the formulation of the demand for children in rural and urban areas.

Shaanxi In-Depth Fertility Survey along with their units of measurement. The statistics highlight several differences and similarities in the four groups. In the case of the price measures, it appears that urban women are less likely to have had a marriage delayed and they are more likely to have signed the one-child certificate than are rural women, regardless of their parenting status. Within an urban or rural setting, childless women are more likely to be currently living in an extended family setting, and they generally have higher levels of education than their counterparts who have children. This finding suggests that childless women typically face a higher price associated with having a child than do women who already have children, and urban childless women may face the highest price among the four groups.
Turning to the income measures, we find that the statistics show that urban women have higher mean household income levels, are less likely to have husbands who work in agriculture, and they are more likely to live in a technologically complex home than are rural women in the Shaanxi sample. These differences along with the educational differences noted above, all suggest that these urban couples will generally have higher levels of income over the life cycle than will rural couples. Higher life-time income may encourage them to have more children or it may encourage these urban households to spend more on child-related goods and services in an attempt to enhance the quality of life for a smaller number of children.
Finally, the variables that attempt to capture couples' relative tastes for children show that rural couples are more

likely than urban couples (a) to have lived initially with the husband's parents, (b) to have participated in an arranged marriage, and (c) to report a lower ideal age for marriage. At the same time, the rural couples are also less likely to know the reasons for the one-child policy, and the age difference between the husband and the wife is generally greater than in urban households. As noted in the modelling section, such differences would suggest that the relative preference for children should be much stronger among the rural respondents.
To examine how each of the price, income, and taste variables affect desired family size, holding other factors constant, we estimate multivariate equations. In this analysis, the dependent variable is censored on the left hand side (i.e., no one can report wanting fewer than zero children), and thus it violates the assumptions that must be made if ordinary least squares regression analysis is to be used. Tobit, a maximum likelihood estimation routine that corrects for such sample censoring is used instead (Kmenta, 1986).
The estimated coefficients of the tobit equations appear in Table 3. As one examines this table, it is important to remember that sample sizes-- which vary considerably across the four equations--affect tests of significance. Specifically, statistically significant relationships are more likely to be detected in the equation estimated for rural women with children (N= 1,635) than they are in the equation estimated for urban, childless women (N=74). Nevertheless, there is still some evidence of interactions between residential location, presence or absence of children, and the twelve variables that

capture price, income, and taste effects.
The price variables generally have selective, and sometimes unanticipated, effects on desired family size. For example, only two of the four equations show support for a relationship between delayed marriage and desired family size. Furthermore, while

rural women with children whose marriages were delayed desire fewer children, the reverse holds true for urban women who already have children. This latter result is inconsistent with what had been hypothesized. While the estimated coefficients indicate that living in an extended family setting and high levels of education both raise the

Vol. 41, No. 3-4

price of having children, the support for these relationships is strongest in the rural equations.
The one exception is the consistently strong, negative coefficients associated with having signed (or planning to sign) the one-child certificate. In each of the four equations, a respondent who has signed the one-child certificate reports wanting fewer children, holding all other factors constant. This consistently significant relationship suggests that acceptance of the onechild certificate raises the price of having children considerably for all four groups.
The impact of the life-cycle income measures (including education) are generally quite weak. Both current household income and husband's occupation have virtually no impact on desired family size. An increase in household technology does exhibit a consistently negative impact on the expressed demand for children, although the relationship reaches conventional levels of significance only in the case or urban women who have children. The equivocal results with respect to these life cycle wealth measures may reflect the fact that while an increase in lifetime income may increase the demand for children, at the same time it may lead a couple to spend more on childrelated goods and services--which in turn raises the price of each child. Thus, the net effect of increasing permanent income may be zero.
The influence of taste factors is seen most clearly in the coefficients associated with the reported ideal age for marriage. In all four equations, an increase in the respondent's notion of the ideal marriage age translates into a

decrease in desired family size, holding all other variables constant.
With the exception of the variable that captures ideal age at marriage, the taste variables perform differentially across the four equations. In particular, tastes appear to operate selectively in the case of arranged marriages and knowledge regarding the reasons behind the one-child policy. Only rural respondents in arranged marriages who already have children express a significantly higher demand for children than do their counterparts who married freely. Similarly, if these women knew the reasons for the onechild policy, their desired family is smaller than if they do not know the reasons for the one-child policy.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Although fertility choices begin with the formation of attitudes about desired family size, there is little information in the literature about factors that might influence preferred number of children in countries like China where there are growing population pressures. In the current investigation we use an economic framework to identify possible correlates. Initial tests of the framework using data from the Shaanxi In-Depth Fertility Survey provide support for the contention that there is a tension between government policies that alter the price of children and people's tastes for children in Shaanxi Province.
The Chinese government has taken a variety of actions all aimed at raising the price of having more than one child and thus lowering fertility. Perhaps the

164

most controversial policy adopted by the Chinese government is the onechild certificate program. Our analyses indicate that couples who decided to sign the one-child certificate report wanting significantly fewer children, regardless of where in Shaanxi they lived.
The similarity in the certificate's effects in both rural and urban areas is somewhat surprising. In urban areas, the negative effect is understandable if couples are reacting to the bonuses associated with having the certificate (e.g., wage bonuses, better housing, and improved access to health care and schooling). However, in rural areas more children have historically meant that a household would have more people to work the land. It seems unlikely that the certificate bonuses could offset the belief that many children improve one's economic situation. The answer to this puzzle may lie in the fact that economic development has been slow to come to rural Shaanxi. For years, the majority of rural Shaanxi residents have relied on the government for grain allotments, regardless of how many people worked the land (Vermeer, 1988). In this situation, the threat of withdrawing additional food rations as a punishment for violation of the one-child contract could serve as the major price deterrent.
Despite the significant effect of the one-child certificate program, in terms of couples' acceptance rates, the onechild certificate could hardly be termed a success in Shaanxi Province by the mid 1980's. Although over 28 million people lived in Shaanxi at that time, only 600,000 Shaanxi couples had signed the one-child certificate (Shaanxi Ribao, June 10, 1984). Our

data indicate that certificate acceptance rates were particularly low among couples of childbearing age living in rural areas, with the average acceptance rate being between 6 and 7 per cent (see Table 2).
In light of the low acceptance rates, it is likely that the one-child certificate does not play a major role in rural couples' assessments of desired family size. Instead, more commonly experienced factors such as living in an extended family setting, being relatively well educated, participating in a freechoice (as opposed to an arranged) marriage, expressing an older ideal age for marriage, and knowing the government's reasons for the one-child policy may play a more widespread role in influencing rural couples' desired fertility. With approximately 80 per cent of the Shaanxi population living in rural areas, it becomes important to understand how these other price and taste factors influence fertility attitudes.
If a rural couple lives in an extended family situation, then desired family size is significantly lower than what is reported by otherwise comparable couples. It had been hypothesized that the psychological costs imposed by living in an extended family situation would dampen urban couples' fertility desires more than rural couples' because the housing shortage is thought to be more protracted in urban areas (Tien and Lee, 1988). However, this may not be the case in Shaanxi Province. If the poor economic conditions in the rural areas raise expectations about the amount of time young couples must live in their parents' home, then this may consequently cause them to lower their fertility expectations relative to urban couples who face a

shorter time horizon in their parents' home. It may also be that given an extended family living situation, privacy and the ability to exercise control over one's own children become scarcer commodities for rural couples and therefore they prefer smaller families. In any case, this unanticipated finding is one that merits further investigation.
Education levels significantly affected desired fertility only among rural couples who already had children. This finding is contrary to the findings of Hermalin and Liu (1990). Rural women who have children also have the lowest mean educational attainment of the four groups in this study, averaging only four years of formal schooling. It may be that education's influence on desired fertility operates in a limited range and/or that the rising opportunity costs and life-cycle income associated with more schooling are felt most by rural couples who already have children.
Reports of a young ideal marriage age were associated with significantly higher desired fertility in three of the four groups (the exception being childless couples living in urban areas). While the relative magnitudes of the estimated effects in each equation are small, they are nonetheless noteworthy because of their policy implications. Age at first marriage declined in Shaanxi during the mid 1980's as the government began to relax its marriage restrictions (Zeng et al., 1991). This policy shift would have reinforced traditional ideologies which may have contributed to the increase in fertility that was observed during the latter part of the 1980's.
The other intriguing preference shifter was the variable that measured

knowledge of the reason for the onechild policy. Rural women with children expressed a desire for significantly fewer children if they knew the reason for the one-child policy. Respondents who answered that the one-child policy exists because of (a) population control, (b) economic development, or (c) health reasons, were identified as having a reasonable idea of why the government has promoted this policy. All other responses were classified as "not knowing." Using this scheme, we find that roughly one quarter of the rural respondents did not know the reason for the policy. This finding suggests that efforts to educate couples regarding the reasons behind the one-child policy may serve as an effective way to alter desired family size.
The generally insignificant relationships between the life cycle income measures (i.e., annual household income, agricultural employment, household technology, and education) and desired fertility in both the rural and urban equations belie support for the economic model. However, they are consistent with the one other micro-level analysis (Peng, 1989). It is possible that the weak results are a function of potentially counterbalancing effects and/or poor measurement. Recall that an increase in lifecycle income was hypothesized to increase couples' demand for "healthy and happy children." To accomplish this goal, a couple may either choose to have another child and to maintain a constant level of per-child expenditures or they may choose to increase their per-child expenditures and to keep their family size constant. Thus, an increase in economic resources may not necessarily translate into an

166

increase in desired family size. It is also possible that our limited measures did not adequately capture life-time income streams. In any event, it would appear that neither increases in family income, or movement away from agrarian occupations, or increases in household technology play a significant role in altering fertility desires in Shaanxi Province.
Couples' desired fertility may ultimately differ from their actual fertility behavior because of problems with access to birth control and/or birth control failure. Nevertheless, important insights can be gained by focusing on the correlates of fertility desires as a

precursor to fertility behavior. It would appear that direct efforts by the government to alter desired family size (e.g., by instituting the one-child certificate program) have effectively raised the price of having children for the relatively small subset of couples who have chosen to sign the certificate. Our analyses indicate that the government may be more successful at curbing the recent upswing in fertility if it adopts public policies designed to change pervasive family values (e.g., beliefs regarding the ideal agefor marriage) that arelinked to preferences for large families.
