Despite the fact that numerous researchers (Whelpton and Kiser, 1950; Grabill, et al., 1958; Freedman et al., 1959; Grabill and Glick, 1959; Mitra, 1966; Whelpton et al., 1966; Bogue, 1969; Gustavus and Henley, 1971; and Veevers, 1971a, b, c) have provided estimates on the extent of childlessness for different subgroups of American -women using period data, no one has made use of available data to derive cohort-specific estimates of childlessness or cohort-specific age-specific estimates of childlessness in order to examine the incidence of childlessness historically.
Such an omission is curious in that by following Ryder's technique for analyzing trends in fertility across cohorts and modifying his technique through the computation of zero parities for cohorts by individual years as well as updating his data series, cohort estimates of childlessness can be obtained (Ryder, 1970). This paper follows this strategy and addresses three questions: (1) What changes have occurred over time across cohorts in the levels of childlessness among women who have reached age fifty? (2) What shifts have transpired over time in cohort-specific age-

specific levels of childlessness? (3) What comparison can be made between measures of childlessness as reported from period data and the estimates of childlessness derived herein from cohort data?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
To examine the incidence of childlessness of ever-married women in the birth cohorts 1891-1945, data were derived using the techniques employed by Ryder (1970, pp. 99-101 and 118-120), with some modifications. Ryder generated two sets of data: age-specific parity-specific birth rates and age-specific first marriage rates for successive birth cohorts of United States women, 1891-1945. He used available birth rate data on fertility experience for the calendar years 1917-64 as reported in Whelpton and Campbell (1960) and in Vital Statistics of the United States (U.S. National Vital Statistics Division, 195864). These sources provided age-specific parity-specific birth rates for birth cohorts 1903-17, ages 14-49 inclusive. Since Ryder's initial paper, age-specific parityspecific birth rates have been reported for the calendar years 1965-68 (U.S. National Vital Statistics Division) and are incor-

porated herein. These data provide complete coverage on fertility experiences of women in the birth cohorts 1903-20.
For cohorts prior to 1903, Ryder estimated age-specific parity-specific birth rates for those selected ages in which data were incomplete. He assumed that the average proportions at each parity and at each age observed for the cohorts 190307 would be applicable to earlier cohorts for which data were missing. With the use of these proportionate distributions by parity at each age, he distributed cumulative birth rates (U.S. National Vital Statistics Divsion, 1960) by age and order by order for cohorts 1891-1902.
We differ slightly from Ryder in estimating age-specific parity-specific birth rates at selected ages with missing data for the birth cohorts 1921-45. We assumed that each age-specific parity-specific birth rate would decline decrementally from its 1968 value until 1978, then remain constant. For each age in which data were missing after 1968, the proportional change in the age-specific parity-specific birth rates from 1963 to 1968 was calculated, then converted to an annual proportional change. For each of the successive years 1969-78, the annual proportional change was decremented by 0.1. Estimated agespecific parity-specific birth rates as of 1978, were projected as constants for ages with missing data until the 1945 birth cohort of women reached 49 years of age.
To generate age-specific marriage rates, we also followed Ryder, again with modification.1 This strategy yielded a set of data on number of women ever married, by age at first marriage for birth cohorts
1For a discussion of how Ryder's technique was applied and the data series on age at first marriage and ever-married women updated, as well as an analysis of the incidence of marriage in cohorts born 1891 to 1945, see Hastings and Robinson, 1973.

1891-1945 in single years expressed both as rates and percentages.
With these two data sets, the procedure for estimating age-specific proportions of childlessness for ever-married women by cohort was relatively simple. Cumulative age-specific birth rates for parity one of each cohort were obtained. Since these rates include the fertility experiences of both unmarried and married women, they were adjusted to exclude the unmarried by linking cumulative age-specific marriage with the cumulative age-specific birth rates. This adjustment was obtained by dividing the cumulative age-specific marriage rate into the cumulative age-specific birth rate, yielding the number of evermarried women per one thousand with one child or more. Since this figure is expressed to the base one thousand, the difference between number of ever-married women with children per thousand and one thousand yields the number of ever-married women who are childless at that age. Conversion of this rate to a percentage is straightforward. Estimates of age-specific proportions of childlessness for all women by cohort were also estimated. The cumulative agespecific birth rate for parity one was subtracted from the one thosand and converted into a percentage.
Limitations of the data.--We suspect that percentages on childlessness for evermarried women and all women in the birth cohorts 1891-1895 derived by these procedures underestimate actual childlessness of these cohorts. This underestimation is an artifact of the retrojection procedure used in estimation age-specific parity-specific birth rates for cohorts 1891-1902 for selected ages with missing data. We suspect that by distributing cumulative birth rates by age and order using average proportions of age-specific parity-specific birth rates of 1903-1907, the actual fertility ex-

periences of those younger ages with missing data may be overestimated.
Similarly, the figures on childlessness for the cohorts 1941-45 should be treated with caution as they are heavily dependent on data derived from projected estimates. Despite these limitations, these data permit an examination of the incidence of childlessness historically.
RESULTS
Mean percentages on childlessness for aggregated cohorts on all women and evermarried women fifty years old are presented in Table 1. A glance at these data

by dividing the TFR by " the proportion of women married (at least once) by exact age SO, again under mortality-free conditions" (p. 101). These data substantiate the long-held assumption that the per cent of ever-married women who remain childless is increasingly rare. It should be noted, however, that if fertility continues to decline for women born in cohorts after 1945, then we can reasonably expect increases in the percentages of women who remain childless by the end of their fecund period.
Within each cohort among all women, age-specific proportions on childlessness decrease as age increases (Table 2). This

· Values should be interpreted with caution as they are based on data derived mainly from estimation procedures. t Norman B. Ryder (1970, pp. 101-102 and Table 6, p. 109). According to Ryder, "the total fertility rate is the sum of all ages of the birth rates for all orders. It may be interpreted as the mean number of births per woman if the cohort were mortality-free" (p. 101). The mean marital parity is obtained by dividing the total fertility rate by the proportion of women married at least once by exact age 50, under mortality-free conditions, and may be interpreted as the mean number of births per ever-married women.

reveals that the level of childlessness among all women and ever-married women at age fifty has been inversely related to total fertility rates and mean marital parity across cohorts. According to Ryder (1970, p. 101), "The total fertility rate (TFR) is the sum of all ages of the birth rates for all orders. It may be interpreted as the mean number of births per woman if the cohort were mortality-free." Similarly, the mean marital parity (MMP) is obtained

pattern of decreasing childlessness across age moves less rapidly within cohorts displaying low fertility and moves more rapidly among cohorts characterized by high fertility. This pattern is most pronounced when one compares the age-specific proportions of childlessness of the 1907-11 cohorts with the cohorts 1933-37. Across cohorts within each age group, age-specific proportions on childlessness tend to vary inversely with cohort total fertility rates.

This relationship is most noticeable in those age groups 30-34 and older.
Within each cohort for ever-married women, age-specific proportions on childlessness in general are highest among 1519 year olds, decline to lows among ages 30-39, and thereafter increase slightly through ages 40-49. It is of note that the lowest age-specific proportions on childlessness are observed for women who reached those ages typically defined as having a high probability of completed fertility although still in their fecund years.
A glance at Table 3 also reveals that the lowest age-specific proportions of childlessness change from cohort to cohort. Women born in those cohorts of 1905 and before showed the lowest age-specific proportions childless for ages 30-34. Women bom be-

tween 1907 and 1936 had the lowest agespecific proportions childless in the ages 35-39. Women born in the cohorts between 1937 and 1945 showed the lowest age-specific proportions childless for ages 30-34, paralleling the experiences of women bom in the cohorts 1905 and before. These shifts in the lows for cohort-specific agespecific proportions of childlessness parallel in reverse the rise and decline in the tempo of fertility as discussed by Ryder (1970) and Campbell (1973).
Of particular interest are the low percentages childless observed for the birth cohorts 1931-39, ages 30-34 and 35-39. These percentages are lower than those usually estimated as minimum levels for childlessness reported in other studies. However, we suspect that our estimates

fairly accurately depict theoverall pattern of childlessness historically, since women born in these cohorts "were in their early childbearing years, ages 15-24, during roughly the height of the "baby boom." Therefore, these women would be expected to exhibit low percentages of childlessness. Further, these lower estimates also are partially accounted for by the fact that most other estimates are based on period data. Period estimates of childlessness tend to be inflated, since they overrepresent women still in their early childbearing years and at risk of conception. Cohort estimates tend to be less sensitive to differences in the age composition of women currently at risk of conception.

Estimates of childlessness reported in the literature usually have been derived from period data. With the use of cohort-specific age-specific estimates of proportions childless, a set of figures was constructed in Table 4 to approximate period-based estimates as presented by Grabill and Glick (1959). Three significant relationships are noted.
First, the period estimates on proportions childless in every age group are higher than the corresponding cohort-based estimates. The discrepancy between these two sets of data generally is greater among the younger ages and smaller among the older ages. This discrepancy is attributable in part to thedifferences in modes of data

SOURCE: The period data listed under the "census" columns come from Grabill and Glick (1959, Table 2, p . 64). The cohort percentages on childlessness of this table are based on a cross-sectional grouping of cohort data to attain comparability with census data (period) on childlessness, i.e., ages 15-19 represent cohort 1921-25. The cohort percentage ages 15-19 is the average of percentage childless for women age 15 born in 1921, age 16 born in 1922, age 17 born in 1923, age 18 born in 1924, and age 19 born in 1925.
