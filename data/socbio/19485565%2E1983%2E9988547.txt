ABSTRACT:Pregnancy histories of 470 ever-married women aged 40 years and older from three endogamous groups of marine fishermen of Puri, Orissa, are analyzed to estimate Crow's index of opportunity for selection. All these populations are migrants. The value of I ranges from 0.63 to 1.08. The results are interpreted in the light of their ethno-historical, migratory backgrounds, degree of isolation, and population sizes. A comparison with published Indian data is also made.

One of the underlying assumptions of ied so far in India (Reddy and Lak-

the genetic equilibrium model is the ab- shmanudu, 1979) brings out that high

breeding isolates, namely: (1) Vadabalija of Penticotta (VP) who migrated thirty years ago from the Visakapatnam, East Godavari, and West Godavari districts of coastal Andhra Pradesh, (2) Vadabalija of Vadapeta ( W ) , and (3) Jalary (J). The latter two migrated a century ago from the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh, and the contiguous Ganjam district of Orissa. The admixture rate between the VP and W at Puri is about 1%, whereas, it is nil with the J population. But there is still a large amount of interaction with the parental groups, especially in case of the VP. The VP, W , and J number roughly about 8,000, 4,000, and 800 individuals, respectively.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data on the pregnancy outcomes of 218 ever-married women of the VP, 197 women of the W , and 55 women of the J populations who are aged 40 years and over (collected during 1977 and 1978 as a part of the project Genetical Demography and Variation among the Marine Fishermen of the Puri Coast) are utilized for the present analysis. The samples also include women who died dur-

ing the reproductive period (Neel and Chagnon, 1968) and those widows and divorced women whose ages were 35 years and above, because the prospect of their remarriage and further reproduction is negligible. The index, /, iscalculated using Crow's (1958) formula.
RESULTS
Mean and variance of live births along with the Im, If, and / are presented in Table 1. The mean live births are strikingly similar in all these populations, though the variability is slightly greater in the VP compared to the other two populations. Another striking feature of the findings is that the value of / increases as the population size decreases. Thus, the smallest population, J, which is comparatively more isolated, shows the highest value (7=1.078), whereas the largest population, VP, shows the smallest value (7=0.63). The value of 7/, does not differ widely among these populations and follows the order VP > W > J, whereas Im follows the reverse order with much wider differences. The contributions to the total index by the mortality and fertility components are 55.5%/45.5%, 63.4%/
