Lalor Foundation Research Fellowship Program for 1981

The Lalor Foundation has announced its 1981 program of postdoctorate grants for research in special areas of mammalian reproductive physiology.
The Foundation will make grants up to $16,000 each to qualified tax-exempt institutions for conduct of approved projects up to one year. Foreign institutions can in general achieve similar eligibility.
The applicant institution has the obligation and freedom to make its own designation of a Lalor Fellow for conduct of the research from among its own personnel or elsewhere. The Fellow designated should have achievement at least equivalent to the Ph.D. or M.D. degree. Upper age limit'is 35 years.
Applications are restricted to research projects in female mammalian reproductive physiology bearing on:

(a) Cervical and uterine physiology and phenomena of basic or clinical relevance to pregnancy interruption, particularly respecting second trimester terminations, or terminations emanating from impaired fetal environment and development.
(b) Areas of pregnancy management which include basic or development work respecting induction of immunological controls, application of recombinant techniques o'f either genetic or pharmacologie character, and comparative physiology within other phylae that may give leads toward gestational controls in the human.
Forms and details for institution appli-
cation are available from the Lalor Foun-
dation, 3801 Kennett Pike, Bldg. B-108,
