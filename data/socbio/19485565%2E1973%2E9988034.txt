Perhaps because of the current emphasis placed on what has come to be called the "population problem" in our society, the important phenomenon of childlessness has been somewhat neglected in the literature. We define childlessness as the state where a married couple have not given birth to a child, although they may have adopted one or more children. Many assume that having children is inevitable for any given couple unless proper methods of birth control are utilized. Estimates of childlessness by family specialists have varied from 6% to 15% (Martinson, 1960, p. 375; Bowman, 1965, p. 105-107). Current estimates from more direct sources would fix the extent of childlessness at 6.4% for women aged 30 to 34 and at 8.9% for women 40 to 44 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969).
In a previous study, we described the relationship of childnessness and color (Kunz and Brinkerhoff, 1969). Our paper concluded that, contrary to popular belief, childlessness was more prevalent among nonwhites than whites. When a 5% national sample was examined, with several variables controlled, childlessness was at least 5% higher among nonwhites than whites, and in some nonwhite subgroups it was over 10%

higher. These differences remained when age cohort, age married, and husband's education were controlled separately or simultaneously.
Our findings were criticized by Veevers (1970) who failed to note that we selected women of 35 to 54 years of age because they would presumably have finished their childbearing. Using much younger women in her study, she argues for a reversal of our findings; however, inasmuch as her samples were still in the childbearing age, the conclusions can only be speculative. Certainly, as both of these articles stress, further study is needed.
The purpose of this paper is to explore another widely held stereotype--that of the poverty-stricken family always having more children than they want or can afford. Rainwater (1960, p. 3) states:
In this country, the problem of having more children than are wanted or can be adequately supported is largely confined topersons of one social group--a fact immortalized in the hyperbolic phrase "The rich get richer and the poor get children." As family limitation has become an increasingly rational process, the middle class has been able to limit family size quite effectively in terms of ·whatever goals its members set for themselves. Traditionally and in reality, it is the "poor people"--the working class, and the lower class--who have too many children.

Rainwater's work is often used as substantiation of the belief that all the poor are prolific. In a brief summary of the data available from the Bureau of the Census, Grabill and Glick (1959, p. 86) found that: "the proportion of wives who are childless is relatively high in the low-income groups, whereas the opposite situation might be expected from the traditional pattern of highest fertility among the poor."
The data to examine this apparent contrast between high fertility and the high incidence of childlessness in the lower-income groups were derived from repository tables in the 1960 census volume Women by Number of Children Ever Born (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1964). Because of advances both in methodology and theory, it is now possible to obtain data from large national samples while controlling several variables.
The sample consisted of white and nonwhite wives from 35 to 54 years of age, who were married once and whose husbands were present. This 5% national sample thus controls for presence of husband and number of times married, which are relevant considerations for this study. The age category 35-54 represents wives whose families are "completed" for the most part, so that the condition of having or not having children can generally be considered a historical fact for the wives involved. It should be noted that the sample consists of wives only and not single, divorced, or widowed women. While this paper neglects these categories of women, it provides a group of women who have presumably been subject to higher risks of pregnancy.
The total sample includes 13,501,901 wives. Of this number, 1,766,443 or 13.1% were childless as Table 1 indicates. The income categories follow the same general trend. Note, however, that in the next lowest income category, that of between $2,000 and $2,999, the percentage of child-

lessness increases slightly to 16.1%. Thereafter, the decrease in childlessness is relatively consistent.
This negative correlation between highand low-income categories substantiates our proposed thesis that childlessness has a higher incidence in the lower income categories.
There is the possibility that other variables may explain this apparent difference between low- and high-income categories; that is, an intervening variable may be responsible for this variation. The remainder of this paper will explore some of these variables.

COLOR OF RESPONDENTS
In our previous article (Kunz and Brinkerhoff, 1969), we found that a greater proportion of nonwhite than white wives are childless. Table 2 indicates what happens to the relation of income and childlessness when color is controlled.
As is apparent from Table 2, the color

control does not destroy the inverse relationship of income and childlessness. It may be noted that in the white population the decrease in childlessness is slow and steady, accounting for a total decrease of 4.4%. However, in the nonwhite population the percent childless by income categories is quite erratic, starting with an incidence rate of 18.6% for the lowest income grouping and then jumping 4.3% in the $2,000 to $3,999 category to 22.9%, then moving slightly upward again in the next category to 23.1% before falling to 17.5% and 14.8% in the two highest income categories, a total decline in incidence from lowest to highest income category of 3.8%.
OCCUPATIONS OF HUSBANDS
OF RESPONDENTS
Another pertinent control variable which was available in the census data is the occupational level of the husbands. While wives are being described, the occupation of the husband is a significant influence on the family situation and therefore included here. This necessitates using smaller numbers in some categories. Thus, there are few professionals earning less than $1,999. This will not, however, hamper our study as we are primarily basing our comparisons on percentages. As is apparent in Table 3, there are steady decreases in the childless column as income increased in all occupation groups but four: craftsmen, operatives, laborers, and farmers. Although the total trend is still one of decrease, it should be noted that in these four categories rather erratic curves are presented. These are all on the lower level in terms of the occupational categories. While service workers are also concentrated in the lower income groups, they do not follow the pattern of the other form, but rather show steadily decreasing childlessness as income rises. Perhaps their greater contacts with people give them a broader field of knowledgeable in-

EDUCATION OF HUSBANDS OF RESPONDENTS
In controlling for education, three categories were used: No High School, High School, and College. The results appear in Table 4. Note the very high rate of child-

lessness among wives of college-educated husbands in the lowest income category. These may be people striving for upward mobility and represent voluntary childlessness to a large extent.
The three variables--race, occupational level, and educational level of the husband --do not destroy the apparent higher incidence of childlessness among couples where the husbands have lower incomes.

DISCUSSION
There may be many reasons why childlessness and income are related in this way. One reason may involve prenatal health care. A woman from a higher income bracket finds it much easier to go to a doctor with her physical problems during pregnancy than a woman without the money for this "extra." Often, low income mothers report to the doctor for the first time at the time of delivery. Lack of medical care may result in pregnancy losses for low-income women.
A second factor may be the lack of money to obtain medical help for correctable problems which prevent or reduce the possibility of conception, such as low sperm count which may be solved by artificial insemination.
A third factor may be that wealthy families can simply afford to have more children (Kunz, 196S). Children are probably less of a financial burden to them.
In any event, there are many low-income couples who do not have children and thus warrant more attention than demographers have thus far given them. Family researchers need to study this rather numerous minority in more detail.
