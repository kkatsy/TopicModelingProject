ABSTRACT:From 1976 to 1984 important demographic changes occurred in Panama. The total fertility rate declined from 4.5 to 3.7, and contraceptive use amongmarried women 20-44 years of age increased from 55 per cent to 63 per cent. However, using data from three national level reproductive health surveys which were conducted in Panama in 1976, 1979, and 1984, we found that most of the changes took place between 1976 and 1979. Since 1979, overall contraceptive use and fertility have remained virtually unchanged, although there has been an important method-mix shift toward an increase in the use of contraceptive sterilization and IUD's, with an accompanying decline in the use of oral contraceptives. Although the singulate mean age at marriage remained relatively constant, the average duration of breastfeeding rose 23 per cent during the period. Further gains in contraceptive prevalence and reduction in unplanned fertility in Panama will largely depend on enhanced program efforts first begun in the early 1970's by the Panama Ministry of Health. Future program efforts especially should be directed toward encouraging young couples to space their children more effectively by using temporary methods of contraception.

During the past 15 years the World Fertility Survey (WFS) and Contraceptive Prevalence Survey (CPS) programs have administered fertility and family planning surveys in 61 countries around the world (London et al., 1985). Over this time, repeat surveys were done in several Latin American and Caribbean countries. From these periodic surveys, trends in fertility and contraceptive use can be analyzed. Only two Latin American countries, Costa Rica and Panama, have had repeat surveys that span a decade. This report focuses on Panama, which had three surveys between 1976 and 1984: the 1976 Panama National Fertility Survey (part of the WFS program), the 1979 Panama CPS, and the 1984 Panama Maternal-Child Health/ Family Planning Survey (PMCHFPS). Using information from these three sur-

veys, we have prepared a two-part analysis. First, we describe trends in fertility, nuptiality, lactation, and contraceptive use. Second, we assess the importance of each factor, over time, using Bongaarts' proximate determinants of fertility model (1978,1982).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All three surveys were conducted by the Panama Ministry of Health. The WFS office provided technical assistance for the 1976 survey, and the Division of Reproductive Health, Centers for Disease Control, provided technical assistance for the 1979 and 1984 surveys (for survey details see Panama, Ministerio de Salud, 1977;Mascarin et al.,1981; Guerra et al., 1986). The 1976 and 1979 surveys used the same sample frame;

the 1976enumeration districts were updated in 1979.There were two strata in both surveys: urban and rural. Two health regions--Darien and San Bias-- were excluded from the two early surveys; both regions are primarily rural with difficult access and have mostly Indian populations. The major difference between these surveys wasthat the1976 survey interviewed women aged 20-49 years whereas the 1979 survey interviewed women aged 15-44 years. The 1984 survey was also a multi-stage, area probability survey with two strata-- urban and rural. However, the total population of Panama was included in the 1984 survey, including the Darien and San Bias Health Regions. All women 15-49 years of age in each selected household were eligible to be interviewed. Several health regions were oversampled because estimates were desired at the health region level.
Several points need to be mentioned concerning the use of the three data sets in this report. First, to make the 3 data sets comparable, the Darien and San Bias health regions were excluded from the 1984data. Second, women aged 4549 years were excluded from the 1976 and 1984data sets. Third, the 1976 survey was self-weighting; however, the 1979 and 1984surveys were not. Therefore, rates, proportions, and means shown in this report for 1979 and 1984 were based on weighting factors designed to adjust for unequal selection probabilities.
PROXIMATE DETERMINANTS MODEL
Bongaarts' model of the four primary fertility-inhibiting variables (nuptiality, contraceptive use, abortion, and lactation) that directly affects fertility consists of four indices (Bongaarts, 1978, 1982; Bongaarts and Potter, 1983).

Abortion is not included in this analysis because reliable estimates of Panama's abortion rate are not available. The indices range in value from 0 to 1 and are computed as follows:
(1) Index of proportion married (Cm).--Cm equals 1 if all women of reproductive age are married, and 0 in the absence of marriage. Cm = f(a)l(f(a)l m(a)), where m(a) equals the proportion currently married among females, by age, and f(a) is a schedule of agespecific fertility rates.
(2) Index of contraception (Cc).--Cc equals 1in the absence of contraception, and 0 if all fecund women use 100 per cent effective contraception. Cc = 1 1.08 * e * u, where e is the average useeffectiveness of contraception and u is the prevalence of current contraceptive use among married women.
(3) Index of postpartum infecundability (Ci).--Ci equals 1 in the absence of lactation and postpartum abstinence and 0 if the duration of infecundability is infinite. Ci = 20/(18.5 + i) where i is the mean duration of postpartum infecundability in months.
RESULTS
FERTILITY TRENDS
Period fertility estimates indicate that the total fertility rate (TFR)inPanama declined on the average by 0.8 child per woman from 1976 (TFR = 4.5) to 1984 (TFR = 3.7) (Table 1). Comparing the TFR's across time, we found that most of the decline occurred between 1976 and 1979. Fertility declined by 18 per cent between 1976 and 1979; thedecline was only 5 per cent between 1979 and 1984.
A comparison of the age-specific fertility rates between 1976 and 1984 suggests that the fertility of younger women

ceptives declined. Similar trends toward increased use of sterilization and decreased use of oral contraceptives have been found in other populations which have been studied since 1976: Puerto Rico (1976 to 1982); United States (1976 to 1982); and Costa Rica (1976 to 1986) (see Ross etal., 1985).
Table 5 examined changes in the prevalence of various methods of contraception over time by age group. The use of female sterilization increased dramatically in Panama between 1976 and 1984, both within each age group and for each age cohort over time. The use of the pill increased between 1976 and 1979 for women age 20 to 29, then declined between 1979 and 1984. All other age groups and age cohorts showed a decline in the use of the pill between 1976 and 1984. The IUD showed little change in use by age group between 1976 and 1979; but a substantial increase for ages 20 to 29 between 1979 and 1984. Use of withdrawal and rhythm declined, generally, for all age groups between 1976 and 1984.
PROXIMATE DETERMINANTS OFFERTILITY
The relative influence of nuptiality, contraceptive use, and lactation were measured using Bongaarts proximate determinates model. In this model, the importance of each factor is calculated as an index value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. The further the index value is from 1.0 the greater is that factor's effect on reducing fertility.
Each year, contraceptive use (Cc) had the strongest effect on inhibiting fertility (Table 6). The influence of contraception on reducing fertility increased between 1976 and 1979, but was virtually unchanged between 1979 and 1984. This finding is consistent with the

feet on reducing fertility, but the effect did increase between 1976and 1984.
Figure 1 shows the relative importance of each proximate determinant compared across the years. As previously noted, contraception is the most important factor followed by marriage and then lactation. Themost strikingaspect is the lack of change in the effect of contraception and marriage between 1979 and 1984.
DISCUSSION
During thepast ten years, fertility declined in Panama, but most of the change occurred in the first half of the decade. Our analysis of the trends in three primary proximate determinants of fertility (contraceptive use, nuptial-

ity, and lactation) suggest a rationale which accounts for the fertility trend. Our results, also, indicate possible programmatic changes that are needed if Panama is to return to a downward trend in fertility. The following discussion focuses on these issues as they relate to the proximate determinants.
Contraceptive use has been the most important factor inhibiting fertility in Panama during the past decade. In 1969, the Ministry of Health in Panama became actively involved in providing family planning services in its maternalchild health facilities. Between 1976and 1979 the Ministry of Health's family planning program made important strides as evidenced by an 8 percentage point increase in contraceptive use. However, since 1979the program's im-

pact has reached a plateau, as contraceptive use did not change between 1979 and 1984. Along with the plateau effect in overall use, our results suggest that two practices related to method-mix and age are adversely affecting the fertilityinhibiting effect of contraception.
First, female sterilization has been the method of choice in Panama during the past decade, and its prevalence has increased dramatically during this time. In 1984,over one-third of currently married women age 20 to 44 were sterilized. However, we found that in 1984 more than 40 per cent of the women who were sterilized had never used any other method of contraception. An average age at sterilization in Panama of 30years and an average age of first marriage of 20 years represents 10 years with no use of child-spacing services for a sizeable proportion of the population. Women who were sterilized have 4.2 children, on the average, compared to 2.8 children ever born for women not sterilized.
Second, for all young women (less than age 30) there has been a decline in contraceptive use during the past decade .This decline was largely due to a decreased use of the pill which was not offset by an increase in the use of female sterilization or the IUD.
These two trends suggest programs are needed to encourage greater use of temporary methods of contraception, especially among young women. An education program directed toward young women focusing on the benefits of fertility regulation and birth spacing would be useful.
Overall, age at first marriage has not changed significantly in the past decade. However, a slight decline did occur between 1979 and 1984. A decrease in age at marriage conversely increases a woman's time at risk of pregnancy. In addition, in 1984, nearly 30 per cent of cur-

rently married women less than age 30 had premaritally conceived first births. Thus, for young women (less than age 30) in Panama, the risk of having an unplanned pregnancy appears to be increasing. Our analysis of the trend in age at first marriage, as with contraception, suggests the need for programs directed toward educating young women in Panama about the need for birth spacing and use of contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancies.
During the past decade, both the prevalence and the average duration of breastfeeding increased in Panama. This trend is similar to that observed in other Latin American countries in recent surveys, namely, Guatemala (Monteith et al., 1985) and Costa Rica. Thus, lactation is the only proximate determinant having a trend toward decreasing fertility in Panama. However, the duration of breastfeeding in Panama is short, so the overall fertility inhibiting effect of this factor is minimal.
CONCLUSION
Our study of changes in fertility and contraceptive use in Panama has shown that initial program success has not been sustained. There has been a leveling-off in the past five years. Contraceptive use is the most important factor affecting fertility in Panama. However, between 1979 and 1984 there was no change in overall prevalence. Further gains in contraceptive prevalence and reduction in unplanned fertility in Panama will largely depend on enhanced program efforts first begun in the early 1970's by the Panama Ministry of Health. Future program efforts should be especially directed toward encouraging young couples to space their children more effectively by using temporary methods of contraception.
