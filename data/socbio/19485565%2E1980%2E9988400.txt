ABSTRACT:The 1978 Contraceptive Prevalence Survey for Guatemala provides an opportunity to examine fertility levels and a number of determinants of fertility for three broad segments of the country: the Department of Guatemala and, in the remainder of the country, the Ladino and Indian populations. While Ladinos had a much higher rate of contraceptive use than did Indians, the two groups had similar birth rates. The lack of difference in fertility appears to be due to the pattern of prolonged breastfeeding among Indians and perhaps to differences in the rate of conception due to nutrition, coital frequency, or other factors.

The 1978 Contraceptive Prevalence Survey for Guatemala provides an opportunity to examine fertility levels and a number of determinants of fertility for three broad segments of the country: the Department of Guatemala and, in the remainder of the country, the Ladino and Indian populations. Past demographic studies have been based on data for small villages or localities in the country or on national census data. The 1978 survey is the first national survey conducted in Guatemala that provides data on fertilityrelated behavior. Thus, the survey provides an opportunity to relate what is known about the dynamics of fertility from previous studies to the national pattern of fertility variation, contraceptive use, and related factors as measured by the survey. For the indigena, or Indian group, there is very little practice of contraception. Thus, other factors related to fertility have more importance in this population, particularly nuptiality and prolonged lactation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
RESIDENCE AND ETHNIC GROUP
The survey was divided into two strata: (1) the Department of Guatemala, containing metropolitan Guatemala City, the national capital, and also a small rural population, and (2) the remainder of the country (excluding the sparsely populated Department of Peten), termed the "Interior" (see Table 1). Sufficient households were selected in the Interior to analyze separately the two major ethnic groups, the indigena, or Indian group, and the Ladino, or non-Indian group. In most of the analysis, these three categories are compared: the population of the Department of Guatemala and Ladinos and Indians in the Interior. In the remainder of the paper the terms Indian and Ladino will refer to members of these groups living outside the Department of Guatemala.
The term Ladino is perhaps best defined as "non-Indian," the term used in

the Guatemala census publications where the term no indigena is used for the category. Deciding whether an individual is an Indian or not can be difficult. Indians are concentrated in certain departments in the central and western highlands of the country. Physical characteristics are not definitive. Use of an Indian language, wearing of Indian clothing, or residence in a known Indian community are strong indications. Nevertheless, persons who speak Spanish and wear Western clothing can be regarded as Indian in their communities. Other factors that may indicate whether or not an individual is an Indian are literacy, practice of certain religious rites, diet, type of footgear, or type of dwelling (Van den Berghe, 1968). The important criterion, however, is the consensus of the community in which the individual resides, which may not be apparent to outsiders, such as census-takers or survey interviewers.
For these reasons Early (1974, 1975) has argued that the census, which is conducted by centrally based enumerators, regularly misclassifies Indians as Ladinos, and therefore, the proportion of the population that is Indian based on census data is underestimated. This creates a problem in estimating birth rates because vital registration is performed by local officials,

who can more accurately classify births by ethnic group. Thus, birth rates for Indians, based on accurately reported births but underestimated population data, tend to be biased upward. Early has proposed corrected estimates of the proportion Indian based on the vital registration data.
Since interviewers in the 1978 survey were not local residents of the communities in the sample, some Indians may have been classified as Ladinos. Language and dress were the major criteria used. (Special bilingual interviewers were used in Indian areas, and the questionnaire was translated into the five major languages: Cakchiquel, Kekchi, Mam, Quiche, and Pocomchi. Of 872 Indians in the survey 89 per cent spoke an Indian language in their homes.) As a result, 35.5 per cent of the sample were classified as Indian in the 1978 survey compared with Early's revised estimate for 1973 of 47 per cent. The lower 1978 estimate may be due, in part, to the growth of the Ladino percentage in the interim through acculturation, but it is probably due mainly to the more restrictive definition of "Indian" used in the 1978 survey. However, this should not be a major problem in making survey fertility estimates since both numerator and denominator would be based on the same definition.

RESULTS
FERTILITY ESTIMATES FROM THE SURVEY
The survey data have been evaluated and found to be quite consistent with data from other sources (Anderson, 1979a). Survey fertility estimates are somewhat higher than those derived from vital statistics data, which may be due to underregistration of births. A tendency toward digit preference in reporting age in the survey apparently does not affect aggregate fertility measures.
Estimates of birth rates based on vital statistics data suggest that national birth rates in Guatemala since 1970 have been lower than earlier rates but that the most recent estimates are still quite high, with no evidence that the crude birth rate

(CBR) has dropped below 40 births per 1,000 population (Table 2). There is no evident downward trend since 1970.
Estimates from the survey indicate a CBR in the mid-40's per 1,000 overall with a rate of 35 per 1,000 in the Department of Guatemala, 45 for Ladinos, and 48 for Indians. Confidence intervals calculated for the CBR estimates are quite wide. (These intervals are based on the assumption of simple random samples. Actual intervals are probably somewhat wider because of the effects of clustering in the design of the survey.) Based on the confidence intervals in Table 3, two conclusions can be drawn: (1) It would be difficult to make inferences about trends by comparing survey estimates with other sources, and (2) there does not appear to be a significant difference in the fertility of Indians and Ladinos outside of the Department of Guatemala.
Note that although the point estimate of CBR (45 per 1,000) is higher than recent vital statistics (39 to 41), the interval comes close to overlapping vital statistics values. Some evidence suggests that survey estimates of fertility rates may be somewhat inflated relative to the true rates. First, the point estimate of CBR is higher than recent vital statistics estimates. If vital rates were corrected for underreporting of births, the estimates might be somewhat closer together. Evidence from the survey suggests that estimates of

CBR based on respondent information might be inflated somewhat due to nonresponse. Interviews were completed for 91 per cent of households with possible respondents. The 9 per cent nonresponse rate would bias survey estimates upward to the extent that nonrespondents had lower than average fertility.
One woman per household was selected as a respondent, but fertility data were gathered for all women during the household screening process. Of 269 possible respondents who were not interviewed, fertility data were obtained for 125 (46 per cent). While this may not be a representative sample, the data suggest that nonrespondents had lower fertility than those interviewed. Standardizing for age, nonrespondents had an average of 2.3 live births compared with 3.4 for respondents. Thus, nonresponse may have inflated fertility estimates to some extent. However, the general pattern of variation in fertility appears to be accurately represented in the survey.
The similarity between the fertility rates of the two ethnic groups has been shown by other sources. Early (1975), for example, reports a Ladino CBR of 42.7 per 1,000 for 1965 to 1969 and an Indian CBR of 45.0 per 1,000. These are national estimates. If the Ladino rates were calculated for outside the Department of Guatemala only, as in the 1978 survey, they would probably be somewhat higher. Glittenberg (1976), in a comparative study of a Ladino and an Indian town, reported CBR's of 48.5 and 49.0 per 1,000, respectively, for the two towns.
Similarly, census data reported by Diaz (1977, pp. 39,67,68) indicate national general fertility rates (GFR) for Indians of 249 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age and for Ladinos of 201 per 1,000. This compares with 1978 survey estimates of GFR of 234 per 1,000 for Indians (Table 3) and 201 per 1,000 for La-

dinos plus the Department of Guatemala (not shown in Table 3).
These findings, then, support the pattern found of little difference between the two ethnic groups, with perhaps slightly lower fertility in the Ladino group.
The CBR estimate of 47.8 births per 1,000 population for Indians may seem relatively high compared with the range of CBR's usually reported. However, extremely high birth rates have been reported in studies of small Indian communities in Guatemala. Early (1970), for example, reported CBR's of 51 to 61 per 1,000 over a period of years for the Indian community of Santiago Atitlan. Hinshaw et al. (1972), reporting on three villages in the Lake Atitlan Region, report even higher CBR's, in some cases over 70 per 1,000. These communities are relatively small and subject to annual variation in births, and perhaps to distortion in the age/sex structure; but the high reported birth rates suggest that the survey estimates are plausible.
Data on cumulative fertility show similar differences (Table 4). Women over age 40 in the Department of Guatemala reported 5-6 children; those in the Interior, 6-7.
EVIDENCE OFTRENDS IN FERTILITY RATES
Because of the difficulty in interpreting point estimates of fertility rates, it is difficult to use the survey estimates to assess trends in fertility by comparing them with previous estimates of fertility. It is possible to get an indication of whether there have been recent trends in fertility by comparing fertility in the most recent year with cumulative fertility estimates from the same survey. The technique used compares the observed distribution of mean numbers of children ever born, by maternal age, with the distribution that would occur if fertility rates in the previous year held constant (Potter et al.,

1976). If the ratio of cumulative fertility to expected cumulative fertility based on recent birth rates is greater than 1, the data are consistent with a recent decline in fertility. (This conclusion requires the assumption that births in the last year are reported accurately. We feel this assumption can be made since women were not asked whether they had given birth in the last year, but rather the date of their last live birth. The distribution of dates does not appear distorted. Period fertility rates were calculated by selecting births in the twelve months prior fo interview.)
The ratios of observed to expected

children born alive are nearly all greater than 1 (Table 5). Ratios are greatest for the Department of Guatemala, showing the greatest decline, intermediate for Ladinos, and lowest for Indians.
FACTORS UNDERLYING FERTILITY
Contraceptive Use.--The rate of contraceptive use by women in marital unions varies in a pattern consistent with the differences found in fertility (Table 6), from about 41 per cent in the Department of Guatemala to 22 per cent in Ladino areas and 4 per cent in Indian areas. Two findings stand out: (1) The prevalence rate is quite low for the Indian group, perhaps so

low that this group may be considered subject to natural fertility conditions. (2) While the fertility levels of Ladinos and Indians are similar, there is a wide difference in their contraceptive use rates. Thus, other factors must be at work in bringing about the lack of difference in fertility between the two groups.
The estimated Ladino fertility rate (45 per 1,000) may seem too high in light of a 22 per cent contraceptive prevalence rate, especially when viewed in the context of various regressions of national CBR's on contraceptive use rates (Nortman and Hofstatter, 1978, p. 90; Potter and Rao, 1973). However, contraceptive prevalence surveys of this type have tended to report higher levels of contraceptive use at given CBR's than other sources. For example, in the Paraguay and El Salvador surveys, the rural areas had CBR's of 50 and 51, respectively, with 21 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively, of currently married women using contraception (Anderson, 1979). These estimates are in line with the Ladino estimates shown here.
There are a number of possible reasons for the difference found in this relation-

ship between contraceptive prevalence surveys and data from other sources. Previous estimates of the CBR/contraceptive prevalence relationship were based on family-planning-program data with some assumption made for private-sectorprovided contraceptives. Contraceptive prevalence surveys measure directly contraceptives from all sources and thus may tend to uncover more use than was previously known to exist. Intervening variables, particularly nuptiality, between CBR and contraceptive use by married women could play a role. Rural areas typically have a higher proportion of the female population in marital unions than do capital cities or the nation as a whole. These factors could combine to result in the observed high CBR's at what seems to be a relatively high prevalence of contraceptive use. In any case, the overall relationship between contraceptive use and CBR found in these surveys appears about as expected.
Nuptiality.--The proportion of women in marital unions is another factor that tends to support observed fertility differences. Of all women 15 to 49 years old,

50 per cent in the Department of Guatemala are married compared with 70 per cent of Ladinos and 80 per cent of Indians in the Interior (Table 7). This is another factor, then, that causes Indian fertility to be higher than Ladino fertility.
Mortality.--The only measure of mortality obtained in the survey was percentage of children born alive who were still living. These data show a clear pattern of increasing mortality going from the Department of Guatemala to the Ladino group to the Indian group (Table 8). On the average, 90 per cent were still living in the Department of Guatemala, 82 per cent in the Ladino group, and 79 per cent in the Indian group. While these figures no doubt reflect true differences, levels of mortality are probably underreported in the survey. The Indian data on surviving children, for example, are consistent with a life expectancy of 55 years for females and 52 for males, using the standard Brass Method (United Nations, 1967, pp. 74, 75). Estimates of life expectancy from the 1973 census, prepared by Diaz, (1977, p. 153) were about 48 years for the Indian group. Early (1970) estimates that life expectancy was in the low 40's for residents of Santiago Atitlan in the 1960's.
The difference between Ladinos and Indians in child survival found in the survey is consistent with previous findings.

Compared with 48 years for Indians, Diaz reports a life expectancy of 54 years of Ladinos. Early (1975) estimates a crude death rate for Indians of 19.5 per 1,000 in the late 1960's compared with 13.1 per 1,000 for Ladinos.
The death of a child can affect fertility in a population by terminating lactation and shortening postpartum amenorrhea. Hinshaw et al. (1972) believe that somewhat lower infant mortality rates were, in part, responsible for declines in fertility they observed from extremely high rates to high rates. Thus, the higher mortality for Indians might support higher fertility relative to Ladinos as well.
POSSIBLE NUTRITIONAL EFFECTS ON BIRTH
INTERVALS
The possible effect of undernutrition on fertility is a matter of controversy, with some studies suggesting there is some effect and other studies suggesting that fertility is little affected by the nutritional status of women. While no data were collected in the 1978 survey on nutritional status or birth intervals, it is worth noting that segments of the Guatemalan population are undernourished. Early (1970) noted the deficient diet of the Indian town of Santiago Atitlan. A detailed prospective nutrition study in another Indian town, Santa Maria Cauque, found the diet

of mothers to be "biologically inadequate" (Mata, 1978). Segments of the Ladino group have also been found to have a deficient diet.
A study in a Ladino area, sponsored by the Institute of Nutrition of Central America in Panama (INCAP), suggests that supplementing mothers' diets can cause somewhat shorter birth intervals by causing shorter periods of amenorrhea (Delgado et al., 1978). Another study of data from this Ladino area, by Bongaarts and Delgado (1977), corroborates this finding. Basing nutritional status on anthropometric measurements, they found that women of low nutritional status had longer birth intervals than women of higher nutritional status; the longer intervals were due to longer periods of postpartum amenorrhea. Women in the highnutrition category had an average period of postpartum amenorrhea of 13.2 months compared with 14.8 months for those in the low-nutrition group. This difference of 1.6 months represents about 5-6 per cent of the average birth interval of 28-35 months. A difference of 5 per cent in average birth interval would be compatible with a difference in the total fertility rate (TFR) of, for example, 6.0 to 6.3. While these data refer only to Ladino women, they suggest that nutritional status could play some role in the lack of difference in Ladino and Indian fertility.

Data from a predominantly Indian area, Santiago Atitlan, reported by Barnett et al., (1971), indicate that birth intervals increase with mother's age from 22 months to 36 months. Barnett found that mean birth intervals did not appear to be different for the few Ladinos in his study. Hinshaw et al., (1972) report intervals of 28 to 31 months when the initial child survives in the Indian population they studied. Given the differences in these studies, nutritional effects are not large enough to be apparent.
Based on these published studies, it would be difficult to conclude that there is any difference in birth interval between the Ladino and Indian groups that might be based on nutritional status, although such differences could well exist. These birth intervals do not differ much, if at all, from those found in Punj ab, India, of 30 to 34 months reported by Potter et al. (1965) and a mean of 33.8 for Bangladesh reported by Chen et al. (1974).
Studies from Bangladesh have found no differences, or insignificant differences, in postpartum amenorrhea by nutritional status (Huffman et al., 1978; Chowdhury, 1978). The effect of nutrition on the pattern of fertility variation in Guatemala is thus not likely to be great, but it may have some bearing on the lack of difference between Indians and Ladinos.

SPONTANEOUS AND INDUCED ABORTION
The incidence of induced abortion is poorly reported in interview surveys. In the 1978 Guatemala Contraceptive Prevalence Survey, respondents were asked a single question about whether they had ever had a spontaneous or induced abortion ("Many women have pregnancies and the result in a miscarriage (perdida) or abortion (aborto). Have you had a miscarriage or abortion?"); and if so, they were asked how many,
Only 5.4 per cent of all reported pregnancies were reported as spontaneous or

induced abortions (Table 9). This is a low percentage relative to results of prospective studies, which show that from 10 per cent to 29 per cent of all pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion (Chen et al., 1974; Potter etal., 1965; French and Bierman, 1962;Shapiro et al., 1962; Warburton and Fraser, 1964; Erhardt, 1963), and suggests that the overall level of abortion is severly underreported in this survey, The percentage of pregnancies ending in abortion is somewhat higher in the Department of Guatemala, which may be
consistent with greater use of induced abortion, but the level of abortion is still

quite low, and underreporting is no doubt high.
Some anthropologic reports have suggested that there is very little induced abortion in the Indian group (Hinshaw et al., 1973; Bunzel, 1952). However, in interviews with a nonprobability sample of 71women in an Indian village, Nick (1975, pp. 26-29) found that attempts to bring on the "effect of the moon" were fairly common. Sixty-four per cent of her respondents knew of someone who had attempted to induce abortion and 8 per cent admitted attempting it themselves. However, the methods used, such as drinking herbal preparations or the juice of sour lemons, deliberately falling down, and binding the. abdomen, appear to have been rarely effective. In contrast to survey results, Glittenberg (1976, p. 94) found somewhat higher pregnancy loss (which includes stillbirths) in an Indian town (14 per cent of all pregnancies) compared with a Ladino town (10 per cent).
A higher incidence of stillbirth was reported for Indians in the survey, perhaps related to higher overall mortality (Table 9). Incidence of abortion and stillbirth was examined by language group to see if there were differences that could be related to translation difficulties. It was found that abortion, as a percentage of all pregnancies, ranged from 0.8 per cent for speakers of Quiche to 5.5 per cent for speakers of Cakchiquel. The proportion of stillbirths ranged from 0.3 per cent for Spanish-speaking Indians to 8.6 per cent for Cakchiquel speakers. Interestingly, Hinsaw et al. (1972) also noted a higherthan-expected stillbirth rate for three villages in the Lake Atitlan region, two of which were Cakchiquel-speaking. It may be that for linguistic reasons early infant deaths are being classified as stillbirths in this case.
Regarding effects on fertility, then,

there is no evidence from the survey or elsewhere to suggest that abortion is an important determinant of fertility rates, although given difficulties in measuring this variable, it could be important for some segments of the population.
BREASTFEEDING PRACTICE AND
POSTPARTUM AMENORRHEA
Because of the low rates of contraceptive use, particularly among Indians, lactation could have a strong impact on fertility. The proportion of women currently breastfeeding by duration since last live birth was adjusted using a model breastfeeding schedule, a method described by Lestaeghe and Page (1980) (Table 10). The results show a pattern of prolonged breastfeeding for women in Guatemala, particularly among Indians. Even in the Department of Guatemala, over half the women were breastfeeding at twelve months after delivery; for Indians the percentage was 86 per cent and for Ladino women, 76 per cent.
Although no direct questions were asked regarding postpartum amenorrhea (PPA), Lestaeghe and Page (1980) have proposed a method of estimating median PPA from median length of breastfeeding. Application of this method results in median PPA of about 12 months for the total sample: 4 months for the Department of Guatemala, 9 months for Ladinos, and 15 months for Indians. Thus, the effect of breastfeeding on fertility is likely to be substantial. The 6-month difference between Ladinos and Indians would represent 20 per cent of a birth interval of 30 months. Similar results were found in the two towns studied by Glittenberg (1976, p. 89), with an average length of breastfeeding of 16 months for Ladinos and 19 months for Indians. Mean postpartum amenorrhea was 9 and 12 months, respectively.

·Using model breastfeeding schedule
NATURAL FERTILITY COMPARISONS
Because of the low rate of contraceptive use, fertility of the Indians might be expected to resemble natural fertility. Natural fertility occurs when no control is exerted on fertility depending on the number of children already born. Stated conversely, controlled fertility occurs when steps are taken to curtail childbearing after a certain family size is reached. Under conditions of natural fertility, factors can exist, such as breastfeeding, which have a negative impact on fertility as long as these factors are independent of family size. According to Henry (1961, pp. 81-91), under natural fertility conditions certain characteristic age patterns of fertility should be observed, although the level of fertility may vary because of these nondeliberate factors.
The Ladino population, with a moderate level of contraceptive use, has an increasing rate of use with age, but the Indian group, with a very low level of use, has no age pattern. Thus, one might ex-

pect the fertility of the Indian group to resemble a natural fertility schedule more closely than does the fertility of the Ladino group.
To make this comparison, we must confine our attention to marital fertility. Of 210 Indian births occurring in the year previous to the survey, four (1.9 per cent) were to women not currently in a legal marriage or consensual union; all four were women in the separated/widowed/ divorced categories. Fourteen of 250 (5:6 per cent) Ladino births were to women not currently in union, and only one was to a woman who reported that she was never married. It is possible that many of these out-of-wedlock births could have occurred to women separated at the time of interview but married when the birth occurred. In calculating age-specific marital fertility rates, these births have been excluded.
Age-specific marital fertility schedules for Ladinos and Indians are compared with a theoretical "natural" schedule in Table 11. The marital fertility rates are

higher for Ladinos than Indians in three of the age groups shown. Ratios with natural fertility schedules indicate that the Ladino rates declined with age relative to natural fertility, the pattern that would be expected, given deliberate control. The ratios of Indian to natural fertility rates indicate no distinct pattern with respect to age, although the older age groups' ratios tend to be lower than those of the younger groups. In the third panel of the table, older-age-group fertility rates are compared with younger-age-group rates within each schedule. Fertility rates for older women are low relative to rates for younger women for both Ladinos and Indians when compared with the natural fertility patterns.
The factor "/n" has been proposed by Coale and Trussell (1974) as a measure of the departure of a fertility schedule from the age pattern of natural fertility suggestive of deliberate fertility control. The measure will equal zero under conditions of natural fertility and increase with increasing control over fertility; it is not related to the level of fertility, only to the age pattern. Values of m for Ladinos and Indians fluctuate fairly widely by age group. Average values are about the same

for the two groups. An average m of 0.18 is consistent with those of numerous other pre-fertility-decline populations reviewed by Knodel (1977), such as nineteenthcentury Norway (m = 0.21), eighteenthcentury Sweden (m = 0.20), and seventeenth- to nineteenth-century Japanese villages'^ =0.18).
With regard to a natural fertility age pattern, the data do not suggest that Ladinos have departed from such a pattern to a greater extent than Indians. To put it another way, despite their lack of contraceptive use, the fertility of older Indian women is low relative to that expected under natural fertility conditions. It could be that older women deliberately prolong lactation, or the effects of nutrition and health may increase with age. In any case, the departure of the older age groups from a natural fertility pattern appears to be at a level consistent with other pre-fertilitydecline populations.
THE PROXIMATE DETERMINANTS OF
FERTILITY
The apparent lack of difference in fertility rates for Ladinos and Indians can be analyzed in terms of the underlying factors with use of a method proposed by Bon-

gaarts (1978). In this method, total fertility rate (TFR) is determined by five factors: an index of proportion married (Cm), an index of noncontraception (Cc), an index of abortion (Ca), an index of lactational infecundability (C,), and a total fecundity rate (TF), the number of births expected if none of the previous four factors act to constrain fertility. The first four factors can range from 0 to 1.0; the total fecundity rate has been found to range from 13.5 to 17.0. The relationship of these factors is as follows: TFR = CmxCc x C . x C, x TF. The total fecundity rate is not known directly, but the total fertility rate is, and the other four factors can be estimated from data already discussed. Total fecundity can then be estimated with the equation shown.
When the total fecundity rate is calculated using this method and based on TFR's estimated for the survey, the Ladino total fecundity rate is 17.2, outside the range reported by Bongaarts (13.5-17.0). For this reason and because survey fertility estimates seem slightly high relative to vital statistics, TFR's have been adjusted to a level compatible with a national CBR of 41 per 1,000. This adjustment brings the calculated total fecundity rate into the observed range, but it does not affect the relative impacts of the various factors.

Values for the factors are shown in Table 12. The small number of out-ofwedlock births have been included in the numerators of the marital fertility rates. It is necessary to include them because TFR is based on all births. Since the model does not allow for out-of-wedlock births (a much more complex model would be required), these have been included as marital births. The factor Ca, the index of abortion, is equal to unity, indicating no abortion. As discussed earlier, this survey does not provide evidence of abortion, and anthropological reports do not suggest that effective induced abortion is common among Indians. To the extent that it does exist among Ladinos or Indians, Ca should be less than 1.0, and the fecundity rates would be higher than shown.
The index of lactational infecundability is based on estimated median PPA, rather than on the mean. The use of the estimated median may somewhat underestimate the actual mean duration of PPA, but the Ladino/Indian difference is probably accurately represented.
The decomposition shows the extent to which proportion married and lack of contraceptive use contribute toward higher fertility among Indians, and lactational infecundability and fecundity contribute toward lower fertility. Because of the way

the total fecundity rate, TF, is calculated, it is dependent on the other values in the equation and would tend to absorb measurement errors in these factors. The values of TF calculated based on the adjusted TFR's indicate fecundity at minimum observed levels for Indians and in the middle of the observed range for Ladinos. If TFR is actually somewhat higher (as found in the survey), the values of TF would increase somewhat, but the differential would remain.
Based on these estimated components, the impact of the two factors exerting a downward effect on Indian fertility can be placed in terms of TFR. If Indians had the same level of lactational infecundability as Ladinos, their TFR would increase by 1.4 live births. If Indians adopted the breastfeeding pattern of the women in the Department of Guatemala, who had a median lactation period of 12.3 months and an estimated infecund period of four months, their TFR would increase by 2.9 live births. Thus, the prolonged lactation of the Indian group appears to be a powerful factor which in part counteracts their high proportions in marital union and low levels of contraceptive use. If Indians had the estimated total fecundity rate of Ladinos (15.6), and their own rates for the other factors, their TFR's would increase by about 0.9. This suggests, then, that fecundity differences, as implied by the model, are less important than lactational differences. However, a difference of 0.9 represents about 15 per cent of a TFR of 6.1; this is too large a difference to be accounted for by the kinds of nutritional effects discussed earlier, which probably can be responsible for no more than about a 5 per cent difference.
One factor not measured in the Bongaarts model is coital frequency, which may be important in this case because many of the Guatemalan males are migratory laborers. It has been suggested that

nationally this migration would affect Indians more than Ladinos, since Indians would be less likely to own sufficient farm land to earn a living (Early, 1979, personal communication). However, Glittenberg's comparative study showed that seasonal migration was more prevalent among Ladinos; 54 per cent of Ladino households in her study had at least one migrant worker, compared with 23 per cent of Indian homes (Glittenberg, 1976, p. 20). These levels indicate how widespread the practice is. A lower coital frequency would affect the conception rate and, in the model, would be reflected by a lower total fecundity.
Data from the survey on percentage of women currently pregnant suggest that the difference in the total fecundity factor is genuine (whether this difference is caused by nutrition, coital frequency, or some other factor). Overall, 12 per cent of Indian women and 11 per cent of Ladino women reported themselves to be pregnant. When attention is limited to women currently in union who have never used contraception, are not currently breastfeeding, and have had at least one live birth, and when duration since the last live birth is controlled for, a lower percentage of Indian women were pregnant (Table 13). The Indian/Ladino ratio of this standardized percentage pregnant is 0.84, compared with a ratio of 0.87 for total fecundity rate (TF). Thisfindingprovides, then, an independent test of the difference in TF. A difference of the magnitude found is consistent with the difference in percentage pregnant, when other related factors are controlled for. This difference supports the conclusion that the difference in TF is not due to errors in the measurement of the other factors, and the relationships found in the model can be taken seriously.
Finally, the comparative study by Glittenberg (1976) of a Ladino and an Indian town found that for most fertility determi-

compensated by longer birth intervals for Indians related to significantly longer breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea.
Regarding the survey data, then, it can be concluded that the similarity of Indian and Ladino birth rates is plausible in view of their different rates of contraceptive use and differences in breastfeeding practices.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Overall fertility levels from the 1978 Contraceptive Prevalence Survey for Guatemala were consistent with what was known previously from census data and studies of small villages and localities. The survey data offer some new insights into the national pattern of fertility variation. Crude birth rates were found to be in the 30's per 1,000 population for the Department of Guatemala and in the 40's per 1,000 population in the remainder of the country.
Despite similar birth rates for the two groups, Ladinos had a much higher rate of contraceptive use than did Indians. The lack of difference in fertility appears to be due to the pattern of prolonged breastfeeding among Indians, and perhaps to differences in the rate of conception due to nutrition, coital frequency, or other factors.
