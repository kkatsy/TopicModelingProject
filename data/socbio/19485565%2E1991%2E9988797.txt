ABSTRACT: A survey of 242 undergraduates assessed attitudes toward use of sex selection technology and the choice of sex of first- and second-born offspring among potential users. Of our sample, 31 per cent endorsed use of sex selection technology, with the small subsample of nonwhites more accepting of utilization than were whites. There was a significant preference for first-born sons among all potential users, but nonwhites indicated a stronger preference than did whites. Students from rural areas were more desirous of boys than were urban residents. The desire for gender balance within the family documented in earlier studies did not manifest itself. Choice of gender of second child was independent of preference for first-born, with 54 per cent of the potential users desiring sons as both first and second children.

Extensive research results consistently indicate a strong first-born son preference in the United States (Dinitz et al., 1954; Fidell et al., 1979; Gilroy and Steinbacher, 1983; Rent and Rent, 1977; Westoff and Rindfuss, 1974; Wood and Bean, 1977). Previous studies have explored the willingness of respondents to use sex selection technology to translate son preference into reality (Fidell et al., 1979; Gilroy and Steinbacher, 1983; Markle and Nam, 1971; Pebley and Westoff, 1983; Steinbacher and Gilroy, 1990). Results indicate that potential users have as strong and, in some instances, a stronger first-born sex preference than the general population. In the Gilroy and Steinbacher (1983) study, 81 per cent of the potential female users and 94 per cent of the potential male users preferred first-born sons. These were higher percentages than those found in previous surveys assessing first-born preference.
Previous studies of second-born preference in the general population have found varying degrees of strength

of preference for balance, i.e., firstborn son, second-born daughter. Clare and Kiser (1951) found that two-thirds of the wives and three-fourths of the husbands in their sample stated that if they could have only two children they would prefer a boy and a girl. Of respondents wanting only two children, Markle and Nam (1971) found that 76 per cent would choose a boy for their first-born and 74 per cent would choose a girl for their second-born. Coombs (1977) found a modest 19 per cent of U.S. married women preferred a balanced family composition. Although Fidell et al. (1979) found that 73 per cent of their sample would select a girl second, they found that only 11 per cent of the respondents who considered themselves potential users of sex selection technology would use the technology to guarantee that their second child was the opposite sex to the first.
The present study examined firstand second-born sex preference among potential users of sex selection technology as well as the effects of sex, race,

and residence (urban/rural) on the willingness to use sex selection technology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
One hundred seventy-three female and 69 male undergraduates were surveyed in the spring of 1990 in a small private college on the East coast and a large community college in the Midwest. As there were no significant differences on dependent measures between these two groups, the data were collapsed and analyzed together.
Questionnaires were administered anonymously to student volunteers during regular class periods. In addition to demographic information, students were asked: (1) whether they knew of any methods by which parents can determine the gender of their offspring before birth; (2) whether they would use such a method if it were available; (3) if "yes," which gender would be selected for first child and for second child.

demographic variables predicted technology use.
When those students who indicated they would use sex selection technology were queried about preferred gender of first-born, a strong preference for a boy was demonstrated (x2(l) = 23.2, p< 0.001) with 78 per cent choosing sons. There was no difference in the preferences of male and female subjects. Race again affected results, as all nonwhites chose boys as firstborns compared to 74 per cent of whites. Residence was related to choice of first-born, with rural residents more often choosing sons than did their urban counterparts (x2(l) = 4.14, p< 0.05).
Choice of gender of second child was independent of preference for first-born: 54 per cent chose a boy as both first and second child; 24 per cent desired a boy first and a girl second; 18 per cent preferred a girl first and a boy second; 4 per cent chose a girl as both first and second child.

RESULTS Of the sample, 68 per cent indicated knowledge of reproductive technology. There was no interaction with any of the demographic variables of sex, race, and residence (urban, rural). A total of 76 subjects, 31 per cent, indicated they would use the technology. Chi-squared analysis indicated that blacks opted significantly more often than did whites to use sex selection technology (x2(l) = 5.85, p<0.05). This difference remained when Hispanic subjects were added to blacks to form a "nonwhite" category (x2(l) = 4.19, p < 0.05). However, this finding must be interpreted cautiously, since only 22 "nonwhites" were included in the overall sample. None of the other

DISCUSSION
The present study analyzed demographic characteristics of that 31 per cent of the college subjects surveyed .who indicated a willingness to use reproductive technology to determine gender choice of offspring. The only factor that was clearly related to technology utilization was race, with nonwhites significantly more "willing to use" than whites. The nonwhites in this sample were equally divided between blacks and Hispanics.
Although the small number of nonwhites in the present sample necessitates a cautious interpretation, greater acceptance by blacks of reproductive technology has been found in earlier

studies. Markle and Nam (1971) noted that 37 per cent of black respondents indicated favorable attitudes toward sex predetermination, whereas only 22 per cent of whites did so. Hartley and Pietraczyk (1979) reported that blacks were more likely than the other social and ethnic groups surveyed to indicate a desire to predetermine the sex of their offspring and to place high priority on biomedical research oriented to perfecting sex selection technology.
Other surveys have not previously documented a favorable Hispanic attitude toward sex selection technology, although responses of subjects in the "Latino" category utilized by Hartley and Pietraczyk (1979) were comparable to those of black subjects, indicating agreement that "sex predetermination should be available to all parents." The Latino subjects in that study, however, did not indicate a personal desire to determine sex of offspring nor did they place high priority on biomedical research in the area of sex preselection.
When the gender preference of potential users of sex selection technology is analyzed, the strong bias toward boys found in previous studies is again evident: 78 per cent of the sample preferred first-born sons, with no significant difference between male and female subjects. Nonwhite students unanimously chose first-born sons, while 74 per cent of white students did so. This finding differs from the Steinbacher and Gilroy (1990) study indicating no racial differences in gender choice and must remain suspect because of the small size of the nonwhite subsample.
No previous study has looked at rural-urban differences in gender choice of first-born. The finding of a 92

per cent son choice by rural "users" versus 71 per cent by urban "users" suggests differential evaluation as a function of residence. Hartley and Pietraczyk (1979) have speculated that "in those countries where the majority of persons depend upon the land for a living a preponderance of sons might actually help families feed themselves" (p. 245). The relevance of this observation to the present finding is unclear.
That parents would choose a girl for their second child, after the desired goal of having a first-born son is achieved, is a commonly held belief. Various researchers have supported this position. Fidell et al. (1979) found that 73 per cent of their sample would select a girl second, which supported Markle and Nam's (1971) finding of 60 per cent second-born girl preference. The present study was an initial effort to assess second-born preference among potential users of sex selection technology. Of our sample, 54 per cent expressed a preference for a first-born son followed by a second born son.
This finding strongly suggests that the desire for balance found in previous studies is much weaker among potential users of sex selection technology than in the general population. Only 24 per cent would select a girl as their second born offspring, following a first-born son.
Previous research in attitudes toward sex selection has led authors to predict that first-child patterns would change with the availability of sex selection technology (Etzioni, 1968; Hartley and Pietraczyk, 1979; Steinbacher, 1980; Steinbacher and Gilroy, 1990.) The results of this small survey indicate that use of sex selection technology might result in a larger sex ratio imbalance than previously predicted.
