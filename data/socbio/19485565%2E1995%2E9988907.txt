An ever-increasing use of genetic traits for the identification of suspects and evidence in criminal cases has brought a corresponding increase in challenges to the use of the test results. The ensuing arguments have, unfortunately, produced a blurring of two essential aspects of any test, namely, its reliability versus its validity.
Reliability of a test refers to the consistency or reproducibility of the test results under a set of prescribed conditions. Validity refers to whether the test actually measures or specifies the trait in question. Experts in a field may generally agree that a test has a very high reliability but may seriously disagree as to its validity. IQ tests are the prime examples of this disagreement among experts. Whereas there is little debate that the tests give consistent and reproducible results, there is a serious question raised as to whether such tests actually measure the intelligence of individuals.
In forensic analysis, where testing is performed to identify the source of biological evidence, problems of test reliability versus validity also exist. One example, taken from serology, involves the blood types A, B, AB, and O. By the use of a standardized procedure, the designation of a person as

blood type A by one laboratory can and will be confirmed by all other laboratories properly performing the test. Hence there is no challenge to the reliability of the test. However, it has been known for some time that there are at least two different A alleles. These alleles are Ax and A2, both of which react positively with anti-A serum. A blood type A individual can be either a homozygote or a heterozygote and could have any one of the following five genotypes: A1A1, A2A2, AjA2, AjO, A2O. It is also clear that a similar uncertainty of genotype occurs in a test result of blood type AB. If a standardized procedure is used which is capable of identifying the A antigen but not the Ax or A2 subtype, the test is not valid for genetically identifying those who are blood type A or AB.
Another example of this problem involves the use of the HLA DQA1 (alpha) gene. In many forensic situations where only very small amounts of the perpetrator's blood or semen are available, a portion of the HLA DQA1 gene is amplified using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The amplified DNA section is then exposed to a total of 7 probes which identify specific sections of the PCR product. These sections are then usually considered as
