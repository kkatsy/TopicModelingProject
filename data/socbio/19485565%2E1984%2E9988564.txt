ABSTRACT: Demographic transition theory expectations notwithstanding, empirical analyses have often observed higher fertility among nuclear than among extended households. A similar finding has been observed consistently at all stages of the reproductive career among a sample of households in Maharashtra, India, in 1970. Neither differential levels of natural fertility nor of family-size preferences and use of fertility regulation, nor differential socioeconomic levels, can explain adequately the higher fertility of nuclear households. On the other hand, the evidence suggests that the direction of causation is reversed, that is, that household type is itself a function of fertility and other life-cycle variables and also of space constraints on the household, and as such, is a better determinant of household type than a function of the latter.

Demographic transition theory has stressed the role of household type as a crucial variable affecting fertility (Lorimer, 1954; Davis, 1955; Caldwell, 1976). Extended households, which commonly exist in traditional societies, are characterized by rigid norms regarding reproduction on the one hand and the net flow of intergenerational wealth from children to parents on the other, so that such households are expected to have larger families than prevail among nuclear households. However, a number of empirical investigations, both in India and in other less developed societies, have revealed consistently that women living in extended families have lower cumulative fertility than those living in nuclear families (Nag, 1965; Driver, 1963;Rodriguez, 1981).
The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between household type and fertility and to explore some of the mechanisms which may underlie this relationship in Maharashtra. Maharashtra has been selected since it is one of the most modernized states in India and may

be said to be at an intermediate stage in terms of both general development and the fertility transition. The analysis considers this relationship for married women aged 15-44, that is, at all stages of childbearing. The data for this study were obtained from a 1970 all-India Family Planning Survey which covered representative samples of currently married women aged 15-44 and their husbands1.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
HOUSEHOLD TYPE
A nuclear household in this analysis refers to one in which there is only one couple and its own children; an extended household structure refers to one in which reside the couple, its own children, and any other family member or members of the same generation (lat-

erally extended) or of more than one generation (vertically extended), or both. Unlike the WFSand other classification schemes, the distinction between household types is not based on couples. In the present classification scheme, stem families such as, for example, a couple residing with a widowed parent is considered extended, whereas such a household is considered nuclear in couple-based classification schemes (Dandekar, 1967; Rodriguez, 1981). Since, for example, the presence of a widowed parent is expected to affect considerably the reproductive behavior of the young couple, it is appropriate to classify such a household as extended.

It is clear from Table 1that the average household in Maharashtra in 1970 was extended. Almost 40 per cent of married women aged 15-44 resided in nuclear households, and this proportion increased steadily with age2. These distributions are to be viewed cautiously,
2Using the couple-based classification scheme discussed above, an earlier study of Maharashtra (Dandekar, 1967) observed that as many as 70 per cent of all households with at least one couple were nuclear in 1960. On the other hand, Conklin (1968), using a classification scheme similar to that used in this survey, finds that nuclear households comprise about 50 per cent of all households with at least one couple in Poona, an urban area of Maharashtra in 1963.In this light, the figure of 40 per cent for rural and urban Maharashtra seems reasonable.

since extended households may include more than one currently married women in the reproductive ages who would be eligible for interview (Rodriguez, 1981).
One obvious limitation of relating household type, as defined, with fertility is that household type is observed at one point in time, that is, the time of interview. We are forced then to relate current residential status with lifetime fertility experience, which raises the question of direction of causality. This analysis will attempt to provide more comparable data on fertility wherever possible, providing then, both lifetime and recent fertility measures.
A second limitation of this classification of household types is that it is based only on coresidential status. Such essential features of household interaction as economic, emotional, and decisionmaking relations may not be adequately represented in such a classification scheme, and the possibility of a bias arises in cases where, for example, a household may be physically but not emotionally nucleated from the extended structure.
RESULTS
FAMILY SIZE BY HOUSEHOLDTYPE
Demographic transition theory expectations notwithstanding, empirical analyses have often observed higher fertility among nuclear households than among extended households in less developed countries (see, for example, Nag, 1965; Rele, 1963; Rodriguez, 1981). A similar finding is "observed in Maharashtra and presented in Table 1. It is clear, for example, that at all ages, women residing in nuclear households have higher lifetime fertility than those in extended households. In particular,

among young women at the initial stages of family building, nuclear households have 59 per cent more births and 62 per cent more surviving children than do extended households. At older ages, women in extended households tend to catch up and have about 15 per cent fewer children born and surviving than do women in nuclear households.
Recent fertility refers to the number of surviving children born to married women in the last five years. Among the youngest women, those residing in nuclear households have had an average of 1.25 children in the last five years, about 38 per cent more than women in extended households. In contrast, among the older women, there is essentially no difference in recent fertility by household type.
In conclusion then, when all women are considered, women in nuclear households have significantly higher lifetime fertility than women residing in extended households. When this relationship is considered separately for each broad age group, the distinction is significant at all ages for lifetime fertility, but only for the youngest women when recent fertility is considered.
The demographic literature has offered several explanations for the higher fertility observed among nuclear households; four of these hypotheses are examined below along with the data available for Maharashtra.
1. Higher Natural Fertility--Nag (1965) has observed that nuclear households have greater privacy and are more likely to break down traditional abstinence taboos, resulting in increased frequency of intercourse and thereby higher natural fertility than exists among extended households. Since direct evidence regarding frequency of intercourse and abstinence are not availa-

with the woman's current stage in the life cycle. In this pattern, nucleation of families increases with parity and duration of marriage until later stages in the life-cycle when women again tend to reside in extended families, possibly as a result of married children joining their parents' household.
These arguments imply that life-cycle components such as age, duration of marriage, and family-size proxy for availability of vertical and horizontal kin and particularly for the mortality of the vertical generation on the one hand, and physical constraints as determined by higher fertility or larger family size on the other. Table 4 presents the distribution of women by household type, broken down by age group, duration of marriage, and number of surviving children.
Firstly, a positive association is observed between age and the proportion of nuclear households. At the youngest ages, that is, among recently married women, the majority reside in extended households (85.2 per cent); this proportion declines to 66.9 per cent among women aged 25-34 and 45 per cent among the oldest women. If the crosssectionally observed age pattern is held to approximate the life-cycle pattern, the evidence supports the argument that the process of nucleation of households is largely explained by mortality among the available vertical kin (see, for example, Conklin, 1968; Ryder, 1975).
Secondly, within each broad age group, women who have been married longer and who have larger numbers of surviving children are more likely to reside in nuclear households. Unlike Rodriguez's results, there is a systematic increase in the proportion of nuclear households, such that, for example, among young, newly married women,

only 5 per cent reside in nuclear households, whereas a peak of 63 per cent nuclear households is reached among the oldest women who have been married at least 25 years and have five or more living children.
Finally, at each age, Table 4 shows that even when parity is controlled, women with longer durations of marriage are progressively more likely to reside in nuclear households. Conversely, even when duration of marriage is controlled, higher parity women are progressively more likely to reside in nuclear households. This is seen in a somewhat different manner in Table 5, where children ever born and surviving are presented by household type and standardized for duration of marriage. In this case, at each age, the differentials between the fertility of extended and nuclear households narrows but continues to be significant for the youngest and oldest women, implying some independent selection of high parity women into nuclear households.
In conclusion then, the evidence presented in Tables 4 and 5 supports the argument that household type is a function of stage in the life-cycle. More specifically, fertility, which represents an index of both stage of the life-cycle as well as space constraints on the household, is a better determinant of household type, rather than a function of the latter, as defined in this study.
CONCLUSIONS
Within the limitations imposed by a narrow definition of household type and by the lack of a residential history, the following conclusions may be drawn from this analysis of household types and fertility in Maharashtra. Firstly, life-time fertility, measured in terms of

higher fertility of nuclear households. On the other hand, the evidence supports the hypothesis that the direction of causation is reversed, that is, that household type is a function of fertility and other life-cycle variables. More particularly, among couples at the same stage of the life-cycle, that is, when both age and duration of marriage are controlled, higher fertility couples are more likely to reside in nuclear households.
