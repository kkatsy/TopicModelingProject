The 1982 volume of Social Biology (Vol. 29, Nos. 1-2, 3-4) reviewed those areas in which the journal had made significant contribution to the scientific literature by determining the journal's most frequently cited articles 1961-1981.
This 1999 volume of Social Biology (Vol. 46, No. 3-4) reviews the most cited articles both from 1961-1981 and from the more recent period 1981-1999.1

By 1981 the Institute for Scientific Information® had computerized an index of science citations going back to 1961 and an index of social science citations back to 1966.2 The Science Citation Index covered over 3,300 scientific and technical journals internationally and 1,400 of the most important scientific and technical books published each year; the Social Science Citation Index, more than 1,400 journals, social science articles from some 2,900 natural and physical science journals, and 150 books in the social sciences.
In 1981 ISI® was able to review over twenty years of science citations and seventeen years of social science citations. We asked ISI® to examine each index separately and to identify Social Biology's most frequently cited articles, their peak years of citations and the journals in which articles were cited.
We found a strong body of manuscripts that had been cited frequently and contin-

uously from their original publication dates through 1981, a time span often reaching twenty years. Volume 29 (1982) consisted of the bringing together of these most cited articles.
There may be a tendency to think of these articles as the best of Social Biology. However, their significance should be seen within the time strictures of the computerized indexes. An article published several years before the initiation of an index may have passed its peak years of citation too early to have allowed it to accumulate one of the higher citation scores. Similarly, since the average time from publication to peak year of citation was over seven years, a recent article may not have had time to accumulate one of the higher scores. Also, outstanding contributions in smaller research areas may not have achieved citation scores in line with their possible impact within their own fields. The longest cited article by 1981 was Newton Freire-Maia's "Inbreeding Levels in Different Countries" published in 1957.
Of the thirty articles, seven were by authors outside the United States, representing six foreign countries--an indication of the international character of the

journal and the importance of contributions from abroad.
The authors of the articles also showed the multidisciplinary focus of the journal. Their specializations included anthropology, biology, demography, economics, ecology, genetics, medicine, psychology, and sociology.
Science Citation Index Social Science Citation Index
Of the thirty most frequently cited articles reprinted in Volume 29, thirteen were cited both in Science Citation Index (1961-1981) and Social Science Citation Index (1966-1981). Of the remaining articles, eleven were cited only in the science index, and six were cited only in the social science index. It would be anticipated that there would be more of the most cited articles found in the science index simply because this index had been in existence five years longer in 1981.
Of the thirteen articles cited in both indexes, the number of citations was essentially equal in each index. The near-even division of citations certainly represents a successful bridging of the two areas by the journal.
The fact that these articles were still being cited--one article twenty-four years after publication and several articles fifteen or more years later--indicated that the journal had published truly substantive and forward-looking articles. This was further attested to by the fact that the average time from publication to peak year of citation was seven years, with a range from one to seventeen years.
Of the 3,300 scientific journals covered by the Science Citation Index, Social Biology was in the top 28 per cent in number of citations; of the 1,400 journals

in the Social Science Citation Index, Social Biology was in the top 27 per cent.
Journals Citing Articles Published in Social Biology
A study by the Institute for Scientific Information® of journal citations gave the top twenty journals in which articles published in Social Biology were most frequently cited.
Given by order of number of citations, the journals were: Human Biology, Demography, Population Studies, Family Planning Perspectives, Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly, Science, American Journal of Human Genetics, Population, American Journal of Public Health, Annals of Human Genetics, Behavior Genetics, Journal of the American Medical Association, Journal of the American Statistical Association, Lancet, Nature, British Medical Journal, Fertility and Family Planning, Genetics and Human Populations, Journal ofBiosocial Science, and New England Journal of Medicine.
Other journals in which articles from Social Biology were most frequently cited were: American Journal of Anthropology, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, American Journal of Physical Anthropology, American Journal of Sociology, American Sociology Review, Annals of Human Biology, Annual Review of Anthropology, Archives of General Psychiatry, Canadian Journal of Sociology, Current Anthropology, Early Human Development, Ethology and Sociobiology, Fertility and Sterility, Human Heredity, Journal of Family History, Population Bulletin, Population and Environment, Psychology Review, and Studies in Family Planning.
These journals represent the significant scholarly publications in the fields of

anthropology, biology, demography, ecology, economics, family planning, genetics, medicine, nutrition, public health,
psychology, and sociology. The authors of the thirty most cited
articles were from nine of these twelve disciplines: anthropology, biology, de-
mography, economics, ecology, genetics, medicine, psychology, and sociology.
The journal articles had a long life. In any given year, 50 per cent of the citations in other journals to articles in Social Biology were from issues published ten or more years earlier.

The topics of the frequently cited articles were most easily classified into
(fl) M a t i n g P a t t e r n s
(j,) Fertility and Population Regulation (c) Genetic-Environment Interaction (d) Ongoing Evolution in Human Popula-
tions.
These subject areas were close to the areas of focus envisioned for the journal a t its founding in 1954. The articles are listed below,

Most Cited Articles: 1982-1999

In 1999 a new search of the Institute for Scientific Information's Social Science Citation Index was made to determine Social Biology's most cited articles, The new time period covered was 19821999. (Because of expense, the new search did not include a search of the Science Citation Index as was done for the 19611981 years or a search to identify the journals in which articles from Social Biology were cited.)
A comparison of the results of the searches for the two different time peri-

ods shows only minor differences in areas covered, some of which are not evident in the list below. For example, under the topic Mating Patterns, reduced here in size from the 1961-1981 search, there were fifteen other articles consistently cited; but because Mating Patterns is a small research area these articles did not receive high-enough numerical scores to be included. Also, several articles published in the 1990s clearly would have been included had more time elapsed between their publication dates and 1999.

CONCLUSION
The most-cited articles published in Social Biology 1961-1999 fall within the area of human social and biological interaction encompassed today by the field of demography. In a 1999 study by Van Dalen and Henkens3 to determine the most influential journals in demography worldwide, Social Biology ranked between sixth and ninth in influence in the categories used to rank major demography journals during 1991-- 1995. In number of citations to articles from Social Biology found in other scientific journals, Social Biology ranked eighth among the most influential journals in demography. Articles in Social Biology were cited in 119 different scientific journals during 1991-1995.
