ABSTRACT: Investigating cause of death is important in the study of mortality. Most studies, however, deal with aggregate national samples and rely on civil death certificates filled out by physicians. Little or no research has been done using parochial burial registers for individuallevel cause of death. This article investigates causes of death between 1854 and 1884 among the Wends of Serbin, Texas, a nineteenth-century European immigrant community. The goal is: (1) to show that data pertaining to individual cause of death extracted from parochial records can contribute to knowledge about historical mortality patterns at the community level, (2) to determine if an epidemiological transition occurred in this population, and (3) to identify changes in disease patterns over time. Changes in the pattern of disease for the entire population as well as for the subpopulation under one year of age are analyzed.

Investigating cause of death is an integral part of the study of mortality. In general, cause-of-death data are obtained from civil rather than religious documents. While there are European examples of parochial records being used to examine cause of death from Great Britain (Cobb, 1983a, 19836) and France (Azemar, 1984), parochial records pertaining to cause of death have yet to be exploited in the United States. In part, this reflects the lack of awareness of these data; however, some researchers are unwilling to use causes of death that have been assigned by someone other than a medical professional. This limits research possibilities to contemporary populations with well-developed and wellmaintained death registration systems. Unfortunately, this excludes research into the historical antecedents of ageand cause-specific mortality rates and

ignores the role of folk medicine providing valid medical data which reflect a society's knowledge of disease.
This article investigates cause of death among the Wends of Serbin, Texas--a nineteenth-century European immigrant community--between 1854 and 1884. My goal is threefold: (1) to show that data pertaining to individual-level cause of death extracted from parochial records can contribute to knowledge about historical mortality patterns at the community level; (2) to determine if evidence of an epidemiological transition exists for the Wendish population between 1854 and 1884; and (3) to identify changes in disease patterns in the Wends over time. I have analyzed the data (which are described below) in two ways. First, in order to look for an epidemiological transition (or the beginnings of one) and determine changes in disease

patterns, individual level cause of death for all age intervals are analyzed. Second, in order to examine changes in the pattern of infant mortality, ages at death during the first year of life are analyzed.
The Texas Wends provide a unique opportunity for studying the demographic structure of an immigrant community because they came to the United States as a coherent community transplanted from Germany. While the Wends were part of the greater population of German immigrants, they remained a distinct ethnic group in Texas, maintaining their Wendish heritage in the face of Germanization and Americanization forces on the frontier. It is ironic that the Wends left Germany to get away from Germans and then settled in the center of German Texas. Until the early twentieth century, even with the decline of the Wendish language as a binding force, the Wends still recognized themselves as a coherent community distinct from other immigrants. More importantly, the Germans in the area recognized them as a community apart from other Texas Germans.
The thirty years between 1854 and 1884 are divided into two periods, 1854 through 1868 (Period I) and 1869 through 1883 (Period II), in order to compare two distinct periods in the life of this community. Period I encompasses the voyage to Texas, setting up a new community, economic and nutritional stress, adapting to the rigors of frontier life, and the Civil War and its aftermath. Period II is a time of relative peace, prosperity, and economic stability for this population. These different socioeconomic climates may create distinct disease environments

influenced by community practices and standards which can be measured and profiled.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The Wends are the remnants of Slavic tribes who once occupied the region between the Elbe and Oder rivers. Lusatia, the Wendish homeland, is now part of the German states of Saxony and Prussia. Linguistically, socially, and culturally, Wends are similar to neighboring Slavic groups such as Poles and Czechs. Since the time of their initial domination by Germans about nine hundred years ago, the Wends have been an oppressed minority who until recently had continually been coerced to drop their own traditions in favor of German language and culture. This climate of oppression and persecution spawned two large Wendish migrations in the mid-nineteenth century, one to Australia and one to Texas. In September, 1854, a group of about 600 Wends left their home in Germany to establish a "Wendenland" free from religious, political, and economic persecution and settled in an area now located in Lee County, Texas. Serbin, the original Wendish settlement, today is only a signpost, a historical marker, and a general store. Never a nucleated settlement, it was a community centered around the Wendish mother church, St. Paul's Lutheran. Serbin denotes an area of Wendish settlement rather than a specific geographic location.
This group of Wends decided to migrate to Texas because of glowing reports received from several Wendish families who left for Texas in the 1830's and 1840's. The early Wendish Texans

sent letters home with accounts of how Texas was just like their homeland-- the environment, the kinds of crops that could be grown, the people, and anything and everything else imaginable. The Wendish homeland in Germany is in the Spreewald, a river and forest environment with a cool climate. Several of the ethnographic sources refer to this area as the "Venice of Germany" (Simpich, 1923; Nielson, 1977). The Wends lived on small islands in the Spree River where their small family farms were located. They used boats for transportation, and even moved cattle from one island pasture to another using small barges. The staples of their diet in Germany were cucumbers and river eels, supplemented by other food crops that could be grown on their island farms such as wheat and rye.
Texas was a big surprise to this group of Wends. They landed at the Port of Galveston, Texas, in December, and it was hotter than the summers back home. From Galveston they moved to Houston where several of the more wealthy and influential Wendish leaders began the process of buying land. For many weeks they attempted to purchase land similar to their homeland in Germany, but finally settled on a league of land in Fayette County (now Lee County) completely different from anything with which they were familiar because they could not afford better land. The land was swampy, rocky, and sandy with few clean water supplies. Finally, as the Wendish settlers slowly began moving in from Houston about one hundred miles away, they arrived in the midst of a drought that was to last for several years. The land cost more than they had expected to pay which left them in terrible financial circumstances as well.

As a community, they were not able to buy many supplies necessary for adequate food and housing. The first winter and the first few years as well were a difficult time for the group. They had to learn how to grow unfamiliar crops, such as corn and sweet potatoes for food and cotton for revenue. They ate venison and bear until they could establish farms with cattle and hogs. Many families were forced to put off building houses and wound up living in dugouts which were damp, badly ventilated holes in the ground.
The Civil War and its aftermath was a turning point for the community. Economically, the Wends flourished as a result of running cotton through the Confederate blockade to Mexico where it was then sold to the Union. With economic prosperity also came improvements in their standard of living. Suitable housing was built, and clean, year-long water supplies were located and used. As they adapted to their new environment, they learned to grow new crops and eat new foods. The ethnographic sources and the parochial death records indicate a clear transition for the community from substandard diet and housing and a high infectious/parasitic disease load to adequate nutrition, adequate housing, and the partial elimination of the infectious/parasitic disease load as the result of year-long, clean, water supplies. More detailed descriptions of the Wends may be found in Blasig (1951), Caldwell (1961), Engerrand (1935), Fliess (1986), Grider (1982), and Nielson (1977).

cally, the earliest burial register of St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Serbin, Texas. Between 1854 and 1884, Johann Kilian, the original pastor of St. Paul's, recorded the deaths of 496 individuals. He also recorded age at death, frequently the date of birth, cause of death, marital status, and the decedent's survivors. In the case of infants, he recorded age in hours and days at death. Based on his recording scheme, the difference between live-born infants who died after a few hours and stillbirths is discernible. Earlier demographic research on this population (Fliess, 1986, 1988a, b, 1989) linked these burial records with marriage, baptism, census, and genealogy data so that the date of birth is known for almost every individual. While it is usually assumed that there is significant under-enumeration of infant deaths in historical populations, this is not the case for the Wends. Other research using these data indicate that information on infants, including the recording of deaths, is extraordinarily complete for an historical population. The fact that virtually all stillbirths are listed in the baptism as well as the burial register during this thirty-year period indicates the completeness of these records (for a detailed description of the linkage process and the data, see Fliess, 1986, 1988a).
In the burial register Kilian recorded the most prominent symptom at the time of death, using a symptomatic rather than a strictly medical diagnostic system. Either the pastor assigned the cause of death or the family reported it to him, since it is unlikely that Kilian was at the deathbed of every individual in his congregation. Kilian or the families were assigning cause of death or most prominent symptom

at the time of death because there were no nearby physicians between 1854 and 1884. The ethnographic sources never mention the presence of a physician in the community. The only evidence that there may have been one is an historical marker near St. Paul's Lutheran Church indicating there was a physician in the community during 1868. Deaths recorded during 1868 are no more precise, with respect to medical terminology, than during the other 29 years.
The parish registers for St. Paul's were recorded in German up to about 1930. German was considered to be the language of education and the educated among the Wends in Texas as well as among the Wends in Germany. Unfortunately, a few entries were illegible or cause of death was not recorded. Of the 496 entries, 37 (7.45 per cent) were not translated, leaving a sample size of 459. An assortment of German-English dictionaries, German medical dictionaries, English medical dictionaries, and the International Classification of Disease (World Health Organization, 1977) were used to translate each cause of death recorded.1 This was done for two reasons: (1) to translate folk causes of death into biomedical terms, and (2) to translate the data into English in order to facilitate analysis. For example, two causes of death recorded at relatively high frequency were "gallen fieber"

and "nervenfieber." Translated into English, they are bile fever and nerve fever, respectively. In biomedical terms, they are malaria and typhoid or typhoid fever. To increase the probability that these translations are correct, they were accepted only when at least two of the sources used in translation agreed with one another.
The data were translated into a biomedical model rather than keeping the folk categories of death for two basic reasons. First, this is an historical data set. Unfortunately, there are no living informants with whom the folk categories of death can be checked and who can add further explanations to some of the more limited categories. As a result, converting these data into somewhat restricted biomedical categories (see Table 1) is a more useful approach. Second, the biomedical model is useful for making these data compatible with other data sets and comparable across time and space.
Once all the causes of death were translated into English and a biomedical cause of death assigned, each was then assigned an ICD code. The Inter-
national Classification of Diseases (World Health Organization, 1977) or ICD standardizes the classification of disease in order to make the reporting of disease and the calculation of mortality rates comparable over time and space. There are 17 major classifications such as "Infectious and Parasitic Disease" and "Diseases of the Respiratory System." Under these classifications each cause of death is assigned a three-digit code which may also have a decimal extension allowing more precision. For example, the general rubric for cholera is ICD code 001 but cholera due to Vibrio cholerae is assigned

001.0, cholera due to Vibrio cholera el tor is assigned 001.1, and unspecified cholera is assigned 001.9. This allowed grouping by classes of diseases. Using this scheme is preferable to the classification of causes of death devised by McKeown (1979) because it allows for the examination of historical mortality patterns using techniques applicable to the analysis of contemporary mortality. Rutenberg (1985) provided a listing of causes of death extracted from the census mortality schedules and historical death certificates. This list was useful for determining how to classify several causes of death. For example, "dropsey" refers to some type of cardiovascular disease.
The original analysis attempted to examine these data by major ICD disease classifications. This proved unsatisfactory for examining the pattern of disease and determining whether or not an epidemiological transition occurred. As a result, the ICD classifications are collapsed into five main categories:2 (1) pre-transition causes (with four subdivisions), (2) posttransition causes (with 2 subdivisions), (3) diseases of early childhood (conditions originating during the perinatal period), (4) external causes (such as falls, drownings, etc.), and (5) all other and unknown causes (see Table 1). These categories maximize what we can learn from these data while simplifying and facilitating analysis. Sexspecific analyses were not attempted because sample size is moderate.
2This scheme was suggested by Dr. Benjamin S. Bradshaw of the University of Texas School of Public Health at San Antonio.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL TRANSITION
Omran (1977, p. 4) defines an epidemiological transition as the "shifting web of health and disease patterns in population groups and their links with several demographic, social, economic, ecologic and biologic changes." Further, he suggests (Omran, 1971, 1977) a three stage epidemiological transition: (1) Stage I, The Age of Pestilence and Famine, which is characterized by high, fluctuating mortality; (2) Stage II, The Age of Receding Pandemics, which is characterized by progressively declining mortality, and (3) Stage III, The Age of Degenerative and Man-Made Diseases, which is characterized by a declining andfinally stabilized low level of mortality. He believes that Stage II begins in the United States about 1850 while Stage III begins between 1920 and 1930 (Omran, 1977, pp. 17-18). The question now is whether or not the Wends fit this model, or if a different pattern emerges in this population.
Table 1 reports numbers of deaths using the classification scheme listed above as well as Proportionate Mortality Ratios (PMR's) for Periods I (185468) and II (1869-83) and the per cent change in the PMR's for each classification. The Proportionate Mortality Ratio represents the proportion of total deaths that are due to a specific cause (Last, 1984; Lilienfeld and Lilienfeld, 1980), and it is usually multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage. The Proportionate Mortality Ratio is a useful method for determining changes in the patterns and distribution of diseases. Figure 1 graphically reports the PMR's. Several differences

between Period I and Period II are readily apparent. There is an overall decrease in the impact of pre-transition causes and a concomitant increase in the impact of post-transition causes on mortality. The most obvious change is the substantial reduction in the impact of infectious and parasitic diseases on mortality. In Period I almost 50 per cent of total mortality was the result of infectious and parasitic diseases, while in Period II they account for less than 30 per cent of total mortality.
This decrease in infectious and parasitic diseases coincides with changes in living conditions (Blasig, 1951;Caldwell, 1961; Engerrand, 1935; Grider, 1982; Nielson, 1977). During the first 15 years of this community, swamps were drained, clean yearlong water supplies were located and used, and suitable housing was built. During the early years, many families lived in dugouts, which were damp, badly ventilated holes in the ground. Many also had their privy pits either in the dugout or next to it. In addition, food supplies were scarce during the first few years and during the Civil War. It is not unreasonable to expect that as living conditions improved the frequency of infectious and parasitic diseases declined.
The increase in the pre-transition category "colic and fever" is puzzling. This category contains the biomedical causes of death in both periods attributed to unspecified colic and pyrexia (fever) of unspecified origin. For now, I am being conservative in how I treat this category, keeping it separate from rather than adding it to "Infectious and Parasitic Diseases." Colic and fever are so vague that without more information I am hesitant to assign them to

another category. In Period I, unspecified colic accounts for 55.6 per cent of the deaths in this category and fever of unspecified origin accounts for 44.4 per cent. In Period II the percentages are 58.5 and 41.5, respectively, so the breakdown for both periods is similar. Unfortunately, this comparison does not shed any light on the reason for the PMR increasing from about 13 to about 18.5 per cent. This increase may be an artifact of changes in Kilian's reporting toward the end of his life. We know from ethnographic sources (Blasig, 1951; Caldwell, 1961; Engerrand, 1935; Grider, 1982; Nielson, 1977) that he was quite ill toward the end of his life. Therefore, the increase in the PMR may reflect a change in his relying on causes of death reported by others rather than on his own firsthand observation. Interestingly, all those who die from colicin both time periods are 3 years of age or younger, except for one individual almost 60 years old

in Period I, while those who die from fever are bimodally distributed. Combining both time periods, 54.5 per cent are under ten years of age while the remainder are more or less evenly distributed between 20 and 70 years of age. Both colic and fever, therefore, are important causes of death after the neonatal periods (after day 27) and in early and middle childhood.
These data do allow us to evaluate Omran's model with respect to the Wendish population. There is an emergent pattern of change between Period I and Period II from mortality due to pre-transition causes with the preponderance of deaths attributed to infectious and parasitic diseases (Omran's Stage III) to mortality due to posttransition causes or degenerative diseases (Omran's Stage II). This is not to say that infectious and parasitic diseases did not have an impact on mortality in Period II; they accounted for almost 30 per cent of total mortality be-

cent of neonatal deaths occur between Day 0 and Day 4; while in Period II, only 18.5 per cent of neonatal deaths occur in this time interval. There is an obvious change in the pattern of infant deaths over time in this community.
Some researchers have suggested that what we really need to be looking for is a shift from exogenous to endogenous infant deaths because this finding would indicate better medical and overall conditions (see, for example, Shryock and Siegal, 1980). This particular pattern, however, does not seem consistent with this population. The most important shift among the Wends seems to be from neonatal to postneonatal mortality. In Period I, the Wends had just arrived on the Texas frontier. The burden of disease was quite high during this time, and neither sanitation nor nutrition were good. It would not be surprising for pregnant

women who were debilitated by infectious disease, brackish water, belowoptimal nutrition, and substandard housing to have stillbirths and livebirths which died within the first few days of life. It makes sense that early neonatal deaths decrease in Period II as overall conditions among this population improved. The bulk of infant mortality in Period II is post-neonatal (days 28 through 364) and is attributable to infectious disease. So the change we see in the pattern of infant mortality may be the result of better maternal health during pregnancy, which in turn may be the result of better living conditions. A further indication of the shift in the pattern of infant mortality is the change in the Perinatal Mortality Rate, or the number of deaths to infants less than one week of age per 1,000 births (Shryock and Siegal, 1980, p. 425). For Period I, this

rate is 72.3 per 1,000 births, while in Period II it is 46.6 per 1,000 births, a decrease of approximately 35 per cent.3
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
I have documented mortality change over a 30-year period among a mid-nineteenth century European immigrant community in Texas. Between 1854 and 1884 the Wends experienced a change in pattern of mortality. This change is observed for both the general population and the subpopulation under one year of age. For the general population the impact of pre-transition causes decreases while post-transition causes take a greater toll. With respect to infant mortality, a clear transition from neonatal to post-neonatal mortality is evident.
This study has two basic implications. First, it is worthwhile to look at mortality change at the community as well as the large-scale aggregate level. It is only through these types of studies that we can see the variation often masked by the aggregate data approach. In this community we can see the beginnings of an epidemiological transition similar to that described by Omran (1971, 1977), but beginning 40 to 50 years earlier than he proposes for the national aggregate population of

the United States. The question now is what makes this population different? This warrants further research. More community studies are necessary in order to determine if the Wends are truly different, or if Omran's model of epidemiological transition needs to be reworked. The second and perhaps the more important implication concerns the data--cause of death extracted from parochial records. At present, within the context of examining historical mortality in the United States this is a unique data set. As far as I have been able to determine, parochial records have not been used to look at cause of death in the United States. It is, however, not unique. With some detective work other parochial records of this type can be located throughout the United States and be used for similar types of community level investigation.
