ABSTRACT: Selection intensity, as indicated by total pre-reproductive mortality and fertility (Crow, 1958), was computed among three Indian tribal populations living in similar geographical environments--the Kolams, Raj Gonds, and Pardhans of Adilabad District, Andhra Pradesh. The Pardhans showed the greatest selection intensity, (1.1811) followed by the Kolams (0.8564) and Raj Gonds (0.7240). Pre-reproductive mortality and infertility contributed equally to selection intensity in these tribal groups.

The district of Adilabad, with its considerable forest area, is inhabited by a large number of tribal populations. Situated between 77°46' and 80° east longitude and 18°41' and 19°S6' north latitude in Andhra Pradesh, India, the district covers an area of 1,633 square kilometers with a population density of eighty individuals per square kilometer. Some fifteen hundred feet above sea level, it averages forty inches of annual rainfall.

and Boath taluks (subdivisions of the district). Malaria is endemic in these taluks, and a considerable number of cases of tuberculosis, influenza, and typhoid are also reported at the primary health centers in the district. Von Furer-Haimendorf (1949) wrote that Utnur taluk was the death trap of Hyderabad because of the incidence of malaria. The tribes are highly conservative in their attitude toward modem medicine.

About 13 per cent of the district population consists of tribal populations, of whom the Gonds and Naikpods (69.4 per cent), Kolams (IS.6 per cent), Pardhans (6.7 per cent), Koyas (6.0 per cent), and Andhs (1.4 per cent) are the major tribes. A majority of the Gonds and a few of the other tribes have become settled agriculturists. However, some Kolams and other small tribes still practice shifting cultivation without having permanent settlements. Their main crops are jowar, pulses, and cotton.
These tribes also participate in plantation work and bamboo cutting in the dense forest areas of Utnur, Sirpur, Asifabad,

By culture and tradition they tend to have large families, and the impact of the district's family planning program seems to be insignificant. We have noticed that a few of the males, attracted by monetary incentives, go in to government clinics for sterilization when they are in severe financial difficulties. We have also noticed that in some tribes, like the Kolams, such males keep the sterilization a secret to avoid the risk of divorce.
Since poor nutrition, high disease incidence, and large family size permit the forces of natural selection to operate in an unmitigated manner, it would be interesting to study the intensity of such natural

selection acting on these tribes. Crow (1958) suggested one possibility for measuring intensities of natural selection and derived a total index of opportunity for natural selection. This index takes into account the variation in mortality and fertility of the different individuals in a population.
In this paper, we have made an attempt to obtain estimates of the total index for selection among the Kolams, Raj Gonds, and Pardhan tribes of Adilabad District. The major emphasis has been on the Kolams, who are divided into two subgroups, namely the Hill Kolams and the Manne Kolams. The Hill Kolams commonly speak Kolami and Gondi, while the Manne Kolams speak Telugu. These two groups are largely endogamous. The Hill Komans live mostly in the Utnur, Adilabad, and Asifabad taluks while the Manne Kolams live mostly in the Sirpur and Asifabad taluks. Intermarriage between the groups is rare. Some ethnographic material on these tribes is available in Von Furer-Haimendorff (1949).

computed following Crow (1958) and the modified formula given by Johnston and Kensinger (1971). The two indices are
/c=/
and
hi = I me + Ime/Pb + If/Pb + Ps,
where / c = Crow's index of natural selection, taking into account only live births, and /JI/ = a modified index of natural selection, taking into account all pregnancies.
I me = PeJPb = prenatal mortality. Ped = proportion of prenatal deaths; Pb =
1 ~PedPm= Pd/Ps = total mortality. Pd = proportion of pre-reproductive
deaths among live-born; Ps = 1 -- Pd. I me --Pa/Pg ~ proportion of childhood mortality; Ps = 1 - Pd. Ij = Vjx* X = mean number of pregnancies or live-born. Vx = variance of X.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reproductive histories were obtained as part of the data on the pedigrees drawn for studying consanguinity and inbreeding in the tribes. The study was mainly directed toward the Kolams whose two subgroups live in different taluks of the district. Comparative data were also collected simultaneously on the Gonds and Pardhans. The field studies were made from November, 1975, to July 1977. The total number of marriages studied for consanguinity in these three tribes was 1,780 (Kolams, 1,324; Gonds, 300; and Pardhans, 156). Only reproductive histories of living women who had completed their reproductive period and were over 45years at the time of collection were utilized for the purpose of computing the indices.
The indices for selection intensity were

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The average number of live births and the total index for selection, with its mortality and fertility components based on the method of Crow (1958), are presented in Table 1. The highest index of selection was found among the Pardhans (1.1859), followed by those for the Kolams (0.8702) and Raj Gonds (0.7240). It can be noted that higher selection intensities are associated with higher mean live births and a higher mortality component in the selection index. Of the two subgroups of Kolams, the Manne Kolam group has a higher index of selection intensity even though the mean live births in the two subgroups are similar.
Excepting in the case of the Pardhans, the relative contribution of the mortality

and fertility components to the total selection intensity are more or less equal in all the tribal groups. In the case of the Pardhans, the high mortality component (67.68 per cent) and the corresponding low fertility differential could be due to the small sample size. Among the Pahira group of eastern India (Basu, 1969), the relative contribution of infertility to the total selection index is low, ranging from 28 to 30 per cent. Among the southern Indian tribes, the Kotas of Nilagiri show the highest index of selection (1.62) ever reported from Indian tribes (Basu, 1972). There, as in the present study, the mortality and fertility components make equal contributions.
Studies among Indian tribes indicate that pre-reproductive mortality contributes heavily to the process of natural selection, whereas in the population of industrially developed countries prereproductive mortality is extremely low (Spuhler, 1962; Cavalli-Sforza and

Bodmer, 1971). While the extent of prereproductive mortality associated with nongenetic causes is not known, it can be presumed that endemic diseases such as malaria, smallpox, cholera, and gastrointestinal parasites which are characteristic of the forest habitat are responsible for the higher incidence of pre-reproductive mortality. The differences in the relative contribution of the fertility component to the total index of selection may also indicate the influence of culture, behavior, heritability of fertility, and other environmental factors on the fitness of the population. These studies also suggest that in the long run, when pre-reproductive mortality is brought to a minimum, the fertility differential might become a main factor in the operation of natural selection even among tribal populations.
The total selection intensity and its components, along with fecundity computed by the modified method (Johnston and Kensinger, 1971), are given in Table

2. The data also show the same trends as those computed on the basis of Crow's original method. The contribution of prenatal mortality to the total index of selection ranges from zero to 1.5 per cent. In a Muslim population of West Bengal it was around 5 per cent (Barua, 1976). The generally low values of prenatal mortality in our data may not indicate real values among the present tribal groups because the informants generally could not accurately recollect all prenatal losses and also

were hesitant and less serious about giving this information. The Gonds were especially conservative in this respect.
