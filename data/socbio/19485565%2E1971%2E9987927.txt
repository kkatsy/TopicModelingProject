Cyril Burt (1961) has set forth the following hypothesis with regard to social mobility (or "social promotion"):
. . . in a highly organized society, the discrepancies between the general intelligence of the children and the occupational class into which they are born is bound to produce a large and fairly constant amount of "basic mobility," quite apart from any deliberate changes in the political or educational structure of the society.
Several studies of the IQ test scores of adult males in various occupational classes have established that stratification of IQ by social class exists and is also accompanied by considerable variation within each class (Higgins, 1961; Bajema, 1968). When IQ scores of the children of these adults were examined in the Higgins (1961) study, the phenomenon of filial regression toward the mean was apparent within each class. Since IQ test scores measure, albeit imperfectly and in a general way, a quantitative trait with a significant genetic component (Erlenmeyer-Kimling and Jar-

vik, 1963), a large part of this observed regression may consist of "biological regression" attributable to the segregation and assortment of the genes influencing the trait. If the distribution of IQ by occupational class has not changed substantially between generations (and there is no evidence that it has), some occupational mobility of individuals must occur prior to adulthood in order for the distribution of the filial generation to approach that of the parental generation.
Burt (1961) presented rather similar data from his British sample, and it was with regard to that sample that the abovequoted hypothesis was framed. Rigorous comparison of Burt's (1961) data with that of Higgins (1961) is not possible because Burt adjusted both the mean and standard deviation of each generation in the construction of his tables, and because his actual sample size was not stated.
In a pilot study conducted by Young and Gibson (1963), 47 males "in their twenties" resident in Cambridge, England were interviewed and their fathers were traced. The results of a comparison between

father's and son's IQ score showed the same regression phenomenon, and also the change of class status expected on the Burt hypothesis. Perhaps more importantly, when distance of movement was examined on a six-point class scale and related to the amount of difference between the IQ scores of fathers and sons, it was found that greater distance of movement was associated with greater difference in test score. The results of Gibson's recent study (1970) of 3S Cambridge scientists, their brothers, and their fathers, substantiated this association.
Duncan (1968) proposed a path diagram which represents the dependence of achieved status upon family background and intelligence. This was an extension of an earlier basic model of the process of social stratification (Blau and Duncan, 1967, p. 170). It was Duncan's contention that before one can evaluate the mechanism of "intelligence regression" described above, one should deal with a multiple-variable approach in which status itself is the dependent variable. Accordingly, he constructed a model utilizing information from various sources, all of which pertained to the United States male population of ages 25-34. The methodology employed was that developed by Sewall Wright (1921) which utilized systems of correlation coefficients interpreted causally on the basis of criteria external to the numerical analysis itself.
Achieved status was scaled according to Duncan's (1961) socioeconomic index of occupational status. When status was the dependent variable and four "predetermined" variables ("early" intelligence, number of siblings, father's education, and father's occupation) were considered in relation to that status, it was found that intelligence contributed substantially to the explained variance in the other three "entirely apart from the joint contribution

shared by all four variables" (Duncan, 1968, p. 10). Of the 42 °f0of variance in education accounted for by all four variables, 16%, or more than one-third, was due to intelligence alone; of the 28<f0 of variance in occupational status explained by the multiple regression, about 9%, or nearly one-third, was attributed solely to intelligence; and of the llfo of variance in earnings due to multiple regression, 5f0, or almost half, was accounted for by intelligence.
Duncan's (1968) summary stated the substance of the relationship quite cogently:
If intelligence affects achievement, and if intelligence is not perfectly predictable from information on the status and circumstances of the family of origin, then intelligence -will produce variation in achievement that is unrelated to the status of that family. The "meritocratic" principle has a guarantee built into it that status will not be perfectly transmitted between generations.
While it has been observed that there is a considerable stratification of IQ by social class, the presence of variability in IQ within each class coupled with the independent contribution of IQ to the variance in educational attainment, occupation, and earnings mitigates against the fixity of the individual's class position and provides a springboard for many persons to leave the class of their origin and hence to be socially mobile.
The objectives of the present study were these: to test whether the Burt hypothesis was supported by evidence from data pertaining to a sample of fathers and sons in the United States, and to illustrate the effect of intelligence (as measured by IQ test score) upon achieved status of the sons.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The sample of this study consists of 131 fathers and their 173 sons and was taken from the much larger population studied by E. W. and S. C. Reed (196S). The

present sample is representative of white males in the state of Minnesota, insofar as the only criteria for inclusion were that the sons be 24 years of age or older and that an IQ score be available for father and son. The scores had been obtained when the individuals were in school. Mean age at testing in years for the fathers was 1S.90 ± 0.52 s.e. and for the sons, 13.38 ± 0.20 s.e. Group tests had been employed in the majority of cases; these included versions of the Otis and Kuhlmann tests. Occupation and education were reported by the fathers in response to a mailed questionnaire that was patterned after the OCG supplement (Occupational Changes in a Generation) to the 1962 Current Population Survey of the U.S. Bureau of the Census (see Blau and Duncan, 1968, Appendix B). In most cases educational attainment could be verified from school reports on file at the Dight Institute for Human Genetics.
Although the original records were compiled from data on families directly related to persons living in the state of Minnesota, 12 other states and one foreign country were represented in the present addresses of the 131 fathers in this sample. Among the 173 sons, 119 were residing in Minnesota: of the remaining 54, 18 were in

military service, 1 was in a foreign country, 2 were unknown, and 33 were distributed among states other than Minnesota at the time of this study.
Educational attainment and occupational level were coded using the Hollingshead (1958) system. Since this scale calls for size and/or value of farm for rating of occupational level of farmers, and since this information was unavailable, no persons listing this occupation could be included.
RESULTS
The distribution of IQ test scores is shown in Table 1 for the 131 fathers and their 173 sons. Comparison of the first two columns of means, in which all subjects are classified according to the social class (SES) of the father, demonstrates the observed regression toward the population mean for the scores of the sons. Comparison of the first and third columns of this table demonstrates the relative stability of the distribution of IQ test score by social class (SES) over the two generations.
The correlation matrix (Table 2) gives the zero-order Pearsonian correlation coefficients among IQ test score, education, number of siblings, and occupational level for 131 fathers and 170 sons (note that in this table the combined index, SES,

is not used). In addition, the correlation between the IQ test score of 84 fathers and their occupational level of origin was r = -f 0.026. In each case the occupational level of origin was that of the male parent at age 16 of the subject. Three institutionalized retarded sons were omitted from this analysis; hence the total number of sons is reduced.
Since an individual born into the highest social class (Class I) can only remain there or move down, and an individual born into the lowest class (Class V) can only remain there or move up, the sample was restricted to the 146 father-son pairs in which the father was of Class II, III, or IV. The mean IQ scores for this sample were 100.57 ± 13.62 (s.e. = 1.27) for the 115 fathers, and 103.84 ± 14.38 (s.e. = 1.19) for their 146 sons.
The data of this study show a consistent association between father-son difference in IQ score and father-son difference in social achievement, whether the latter difference is measured in terms of ISP score or social class. The Hollingshead Index of

Social Position (ISP score) was calculated for all fathers and sons. This index provides a rating from 11 (high) to 77 (low) which can be treated as a continuous variable. The correlation between fatherson difference in IQ score and father-son difference in ISP score for the total sample is r = + 0.291 ± 0.080 5r. For the restricted sample that includes only the fathers in Classes II, III, and IV with their sons, r = + 0.368 ± 0.066 Sr. The exclusion of sons born into the extreme classes thus slightly increases the value of the correlation coefficient and at the same time provides a more rigorous test of the Burt hypothesis.
Table 3 shows the relationship between father-son difference in IQ score and change in social class of the sons for the sample of 170 pairs. Table 4 is confined to the sample of 146 pairs, and shows the same relationship. These latter data are represented graphically in Figure 1, in which the cases of father-son difference greater than 37.5 points are omitted. The negative and positive extremes held three

When the occupational level of the son is taken as the dependent variable andthe remaining variables in Table 2 are taken to be the independent variables, 56.25%

of the variance in occupational level is accounted for by linear prediction from the 7 "predetermined" variables (the multiple R for the system is 0.75).
It is also useful to consider both education and occupational level of the sons as separate dependent variables, in order to assess the relative roles of the son's IQ score and number of siblings, and the education and occupation of the father as

independent variables in each case. Table 5 gives the results of these analyses.
DISCUSSION
The data of the present study support the hypothesis that father-son differences in social position are attributable in some degree to father-son differences in ability as measured by IQ test score. Since IQ tests were originally designed with the objective of predicting success in school (and

to a lesser degree, in society), it is not surprising that the two measures of ability (IQ score and occupational achievement) are associated. As Burt (1961) pointed out and as the data of this study show (Table 1), there is a difference in the distribution of IQ scores by a subject's social class of origin vs. the subject's own class. The "basic mobility" required by the hypothesis to restore the original occupational distribution of IQ scores is asso-

dated with differences in IQ score between fathers and sons (Tables 3 and 4). Figure 1 demonstrates that the amount and direction of father-son difference in IQ score is directly associated with movement from the social class of origin. This is also reflected in the correlation between fatherson difference in IQ score and father-son difference in social position {r=z-\- 0.368 for the sample of 146 sons).
Upon examining the correlations among IQ score, educational level, and occupational level (Table 2), there is a small apparent difference between the two generations in the roles played by education and IQ score as contributors to achieved status. Whereas the correlation between IQ score and occupational level for the fathers is + 0.569, the value for the sons is lower, at + 0.497. This difference is not statistically significant at the 0.0S level, but one may infer that the IQ score of the fathers is somewhat more closely associated with their achievement than is that of their sons, when achievement is measured by occupational level. A large part of this difference is attributable to the difference in age of the subjects when their occupation was rated. The mean age of the fathers at the time of the study was 52 years, but that of the sons was only 27 years. Hence the fathers had opportunity for (intragenerational) mobility. If the sons are followed up some 25 years from now, the correlation should even more closely resemble that of the fathers.
The relationship between education and occupation for the two generations also differs, but in the opposite direction. The correlation between educational level and occupational level is + 0.582 for the fathers and + 0.724 for the sons (Table 2). Again, difference between generations is not significant at the 0.05 level. In this case, the inference that education is more closely associated with the occupational

achievement of the sons is supported by the knowledge of a change in the educational structure during this generation, specifically the advent of compulsory education laws. Given the higher correlation of IQ score with education for the fathers (r = + 0.719) than for the sons (r = + 0.568) and the higher mean educational level of the sons (3.45 vs. 4.49), it may be inferred that in the earlier generation the subjects with higher IQ scores tended to stay in school longer than their contemporaries. The first-order partial correlation between education and occupation ("holding IQ constant") is + 0 . 3 0 8 for the fathers and + 0 . 6 2 8 for the sons. In these data, then, there is evidence that the amount of formal education is more closely associated with the occupational level of the sons than with that of the fathers.
The correlation between IQ score and occupational level of origin for the two generations is not significantly different: for the sons, r = + 0.324 and for the fathers r = + 0.206. The probability of obtaining these two values when sampling from the same population is P = 0.58. This rather low correlation is consistent with the observed variability in mean IQ score within social classes and the regression toward the population mean of the sons born into each class (Table 1).
There are at least two points of interest in interpreting the results in Table 5. First, the two largest contributions to the explained variance in both education and occupational level are the IQ test score of the son and the occupational level of the father. Of the 44% of the variance in education accounted for by all four variables, 11.8%, or over one-fourth, is due to intelligence alone; and of the 37% of variance in occupational level explained by the multiple regression, 12.5%, or about one-third, is attributable solely to intelligence. The father's occupational level
