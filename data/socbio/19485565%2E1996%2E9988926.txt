ABSTRACT: This study examines the intermediate determinants of fertility in Sri Lanka by making use of the data collected in the 1982 Sri Lanka Contraceptive Prevalence Survey and the 1987 Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Survey. The analysis shows that the most important inhibitor of potential fertility is deliberate control. The marital structure of the population is also an important fertility-inhibitor, but lactational infecundability is increasingly becoming an unimportant contributor. The findings show the success of the family planning program in Sri Lanka, which propelled fertility to a substantial lower level. Achievement of the replacement level fertility by the turn of the century, set by the Sri Lankan government, would largely depend on the efforts to increase the quality and quantity of contraceptive use and the duration of breastfeeding.

Even though Sri Lanka is among the least developed of the Third World countries, it is characterized by a continued high level of socioeconomic development, high literacy, low mortality, increasing status for women, and is becoming a nonagrarian economy. Related to the socioeconomic and cultural changes taking place, the country is experiencing rapid fertility decline. Many couples in Sri Lanka intend to have very small families and have rapidly adopted fertility regulation (De Silva, 1991).
The dramatic change in fertility in Sri Lanka during the past three decades has been well documented (Department of Census and Statistics, 1988; Ministry of Health, 1992). The total fertility rate (TFR) fell from 5.3 children per woman in 1953 to 2.6 children per woman in 1985-87. Throughout the 1960's and 1970's TFR decline was moderate, but during 1980's it

gathered momentum. The TFR of 1981 was as high as 3.4 children but declined by 24 per cent, or almost one child, by the period 1985-87. The rapidity that has characterized the decline in fertility makes Sri Lanka an unusually interesting case for examining the determinants of fertility among developing countries (Gajanayake and Caldwell, 1989; De Silva, 1990a).
There have been numerous studies on fertility in Sri Lanka, but still little is known about the precise nature of the determinants of the recent fertility change. Studies of the determinants of fertility levels and their changes often seek to measure the impact of socioeconomic factors on fertility. Substantial insights can be gained if, in addition to the socioeconomic factors influencing fertility, the specific mechanisms through which these factors operate are identified (Gajanayake, 1983). For example, the level of edu-

cation of women is a socioeconomic indicator that is frequently found to be negatively related to fertility. A more detailed analysis may show that among educated women marriage is relatively late or the use of contraception more frequent, thus clarifying the relationship between education and fertility (Freedman, 1987). In general, the biological and behavioral factors through which socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental variables affect fertility are called intermediate fertility variables (Hobcraft, 1987). To examine the trends in these intermediate variables, Bongaarts's intermediate determinants model has been applied on the data obtained in two large surveys in Sri Lanka to quantify the fertilityinhibiting effects of the important determinants of fertility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data for analysis are drawn from the 1987 Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Survey (SLDHS) and the 1982 Sri Lanka Contraceptive Prevalence Survey (SLCPS). The sample of the 1987 SLDHS is a multi-stage stratified probability sample representative of the entire country excluding Northern and Eastern provinces. The two provinces contain approximately 14 per cent of the 1986 estimated population of Sri Lanka. During the enumeration, 8,119 households and 6,170 eligible women were identified and interviews were completed among 5,865 ever-married women of aged 15-49 with a response rate of 95.1 per cent. The questionnaire in SLDHS has two distinct parts: household questionnaire and individual questionnaire. The household questionnaire listed all

usual residents and any visitors who slept in the household the night before the interview together with some basic information such as age and marital status. The household questionnaire was used to identify women who were eligible for the individual interview. The individual questionnaire devoted attention to obtaining information not only on fertility and family planning but also marriage, fertility preferences, husband background information, and health status of children (Department of Census and Statistics, 1988).
The 1982 Sri Lanka Contraceptive Prevalence Survey (SLCPS) was the last survey to cover the whole country. Because of the civil war in the Northern and Eastern provinces these areas were not included in any subsequent fertility or family planning surveys. However, for comparison purpose with 1987 SLDHS, data pertaining to Northern and Eastern provinces of the 1982 SLCPS has been excluded in subsequent analysis, in order to make these two surveys comparable with the geographic areas covered. The basis of the SLCPS was multi-stage probability sampling. It also had two main sections: household questionnaire and individual questionnaire. A total of 6,315 households were listed and 5,753 were completed. Among females listed in the household questionnaire there were 4,666 eligible respondents. Of these, 96 per cent or 4,500 evermarried women of ages 15-49 were successfully interviewed using individual questionnaires (Department of Census and Statistics, 1983).

quantification, however, Bongaarts (1978 and 1983) reduced those variables into eight factors. He demonstrated that variation in only four of them, namely the proportion married, contraception, induced abortion, and postpartum infecundability are of any substantial importance in the analysis of fertility determinants or trends. In this multiplicative model of Bongaarts on intermediate fertility, he expressed the actual level of fertility (TFR) as the outcome of the fertility-reducing effects of these four main intermediate determinants on a total fecundity rate (TF), which represents the fertility level in the absence of any reduction by the four determinants:
TFR = Cm x Ccx Ca x Ci x TF
where Cm is the index of proportion married, Cc the index of contraception, Ca the index of induced abortion, Ci the index of postpartum infecundability.
In the model, the impact of these four intermediate variables are measured; the effects attributed to each determinant are measured independent of the effect of other measured or unmeasured factors. When an intermediate variable has no fertility-inhibiting effect, the corresponding index equals unity. If the fertility inhibition is complete, the index equals zero. Thus, the complement of the index value gives the estimated percentage reduction in fertility due to that intermediate determinant. The usefulness of the model, however, does not depend on the availability of absolutely precise estimates of the required measures. As long as reasonable estimates are available, the model is quite useful in assessing the extent to which the four intermediate

determinants inhibit fertility and how their contributions change over time.
RESULTS
Since variations in fertility can be attributed to the differential impact of marriage, contraception, induced abortion, and postpartum infecundability and induced abortion, a brief overview of these factors are presented along with the corresponding estimates of indices.
MARRIAGE CHANGE
The delay in marriage and its impact on fertility have led Kirk (1969) to refer to Sri Lanka as "the Ireland of Asia." Although Sri Lanka is located in South Asia which is noted for its universal and early marriage for females, in Sri Lanka marriage is now very late and may no longer be universal. As observed in the 1987 SLDHS, 6 per cent and 4 per cent of females in ages 40-44 and 45-49 were never married, and the general trend shows a little upward movement of permanent celibacy (Table 1).
The trend of a steady increase in the proportion never-married among young women has been observed in Sri Lanka for a very long time. Thus, as illustrated in Table 1, the proportion of never-married women in the age group 15-19 increased from the already high figure of 75 per cent in 1946 to 93 per cent in 1987. The next age group saw a sharper increase in the proportion of never-married which rose from 29 per cent to 57 per cent over the same period.

(SMAM) is used to examine intensity of first marriage in Sri Lanka. The SMAM is the mean age at first marriage among those who ever marry. In other words SMAM as calculated here is the average number of years spent in the single state by those who marry before age 50.
The SMAM of females in 1901 was as early as 18.3 years, a level higher than that found by the World Fertility Survey in contemporary Bangladesh or Nepal and only little below that recorded for Indonesia or Pakistan (Smith, 1980). Therefore, Caldwell and others (1989) identified Sri Lanka as the leader in Third World Asia's change in marriage patterns; by the mid 1970's Sri Lankan females were marrying not at puberty but a decade later.
The SMAM of females increased by almost 4 years over the last 30 years, but there was little increase for men. Thus, the sex differentials have dropped from over 6 years in 1946 to 3.5 years in 1981.The SMAM of males

in Sri Lanka from 1963 remains almost constant at 28 years, while females recorded a slight increase, from 23.5 to 24.4 in the period 1971-81. As found in 1987 SLDHS, the SMAM of females has increased further to the level of 24.8 years from the 24.7 of the 1982 SLCPS. The principal explanations put forward for the rise in the female age at marriage in Sri Lanka are a marriage squeeze and an economic squeeze (Fernando, 1985; Caldwell et al., 1989).
The marriage pattern in Sri Lanka usually shows differences of about 5 years in the ages of brides and grooms. Most women marry between the ages 15-29; and most men, between the ages 20-34. Therefore, the availability of men and women at these marriageable ages influences the formation of unions. Censuses from 1901 to 1953 do not indicate any sex imbalance at these popular marriageable ages. However, since 1963 the situation has changed. There is a shortage of males in marriageable ages, indicating a serious

246

marriage squeeze caused by the age difference between spouses in a population-growth situation where each age group is larger than the next oldest.
For the past several decades, the economic situation of the country has put marriage in an economic squeeze. Economic hardship is directly linked to finding money for a dowry and housing, and the increasing unemployment and civil war have all tightened the squeeze. Throughout the country, the unemployment level among young educated males is high, and most of the survey respondents from many surveys have emphasized the impossibility of marrying daughters to unemployed men (Caldwell et al., 1989; De Silva, 19906).
The demographic impact of the marriage changes has certainly been considerable. Fernando (1975) has ascribed almost all of Sri Lanka's fertility decline between 1963 and 1969 to changes in the female age at marriage, while Alam and Cleland (1981) have attributed 59 per cent of the fertility decline between 1963 and 1971 and 46 per cent of the decline between 1971 and 1975 to marriage changes. Although the nuptiality pattern has changed greatly during the past several decades, in Sri Lanka procreation is almost entirely within marriage, so that any upward or downward trend in nuptiality would therefore influence the fertility of Sri Lankan women.
TOTAL FERTILITY, MARITAL FERTILITY
AND INDEX OF CM
Until around the mid 1950's, fertility in Sri Lanka remained at a relatively high level. The crude birth rate showed

a decline between 1953 and 1963 which is mainly attributed to changes in the age structure of the female population. Over the past three decades, there has been a substantial decline in the TFR in Sri Lanka, from 5.0 in 1963 to 3.7 in 1981-82 and to 2.6 in 1985-87. The average annual decline in TFR was only 1.4 per cent during 1963 and 1981-82, but the decline was over 6 per cent during 1981-82 and 1985-87.
Current fertility of the 1987 SLDHS has been estimated by averaging the reported births of the three years (36 months) prior to the survey date, while in 1982 SLCPS current fertility was estimated by taking births occurring over the 12-month period prior to the survey data. The age-specific marital fertility rates were derived by dividing the age-specific fertility rates by the proportions of women who were currently married in each age group, with minor adjustments for possible distortion in the proportion married in the 15-19 years age group. As shown in Table 2, in the 1982 and 1987 surveys only 7 per cent of currently married women represent the ages 15-19. Therefore, age-specific marital fertility rates (ASMFR) for that age group are much higher than for other age groups. Bongaarts and Potter (1983) suggest that the value of the ASMFR for the age group 15-19 be estimated at 0.75 times of the ASMFR of age group 20-24.
Age-specific fertility rates (ASFR's), as presented in Table 2, show a broad flat-top distribution. In both surveys age-specific fertility is highest among women aged 25-29; thereafter, it declines. During the period 1985-87, except in the ages 45-49, fertility in all ages has declined considerably. The decline was more strong among women

aged 30 and over. A comparison of ASFR's of two surveys shows that most of the fertility decline in Sri Lanka, as exemplified by age-specific current fertility rates, is mainly the product of a decrease in marital fertility among older women, with the exception of those above 45 (Table 2).
Once the couples reach the number of children they do not wish to exceed, efforts are made to stop childbearing, thereby reducing marital fertility rates disproportionately at older ages and lowering the average age of the mother at last birth. Thus, as noted by Knodel (1979, 1987), trends in marital fertility to older women should be more sensitive to changes in the extent of family limitation practices than trends in overall fertility trends. From the data presented in Table 2, the total marital fertility rate after age 30 and above (7M30 + ) is obtained for the two periods; summing the age-specific marital fertility rates experienced by women aged 30 and above and then multiplying by 5 since the age-specific rates were calculated for five-year age intervals. As expected the decline in TM30+ is much higher (31 per cent) than the decline in the total marital fertility rate (18 per cent) for the same period.
Index of marriage, Cm, is a fertility weighted index of proportions married, calculated by taking the weighted average of the proportions married in the different age groups with the greatest weights being given to age groups with high fertility rates. The TFR of 2.62 and total marital fertility (TM) of 5.24 of the 1987 SLDHS resulted in a Cm value of 0.501, while Cm value of the 1982 SLCPS resulted in 0.578 (Table 2).

CONTRACEPTION AND INDEX OF CC
In 1965, by a cabinet decision, family planning was introduced as a national policy and became active only in 1968 when the Family Health Bureau was established to co-ordinate and direct the activities of the national program, within the Ministry of Health. However, the acceptance of modern contraception in the country is a relatively recent development. In the 1976 Sri Lanka World Fertility Survey (SLWFS), current users among currently married women of ages 15-49 were estimated at 34 per cent, 41 per cent of whom were relying on traditional methods and 31 per cent on sterilization (Table 3). Between the 1975 SLWFS and the 1982 SLCPS, the reported prevalence of contraception increased from 34 per cent to 58 per cent, but reported use of traditional methods increased more rapidly than the use of modern methods.
The overall contraceptive prevalence of 58 per cent in 1982 SLCPS had increased to 62 per cent by 1987 SLDHS. Current use of all modern temporary methods has remained virtually constant at around 10 per cent in all three surveys. Traditional method use increased initially from 14 per cent to 26 per cent between 1975 and 1982 respectively, but has subsequently declined to 21 per cent in 1987. Among the current users in 1987 almost onehalf (48 per cent) were users of sterilization while less than one in five (17 per cent) used any modern temporary methods (Table 3). After sterilization, in all three surveys, the most widely used method is periodic abstinence (rhythm or safe period). Among the traditional methods the safe period

shows an increasing trend and definitely lays claim to being a future research priority so as to ascertain exactly how Sri Lankan couples employ it and what success in preventing pregnancy they may expect from it.
The fertility transition is taking place while the Sri Lankan population is largely rural and agricultural, and there seems to be a general receptivity among broad segments of the population, including those with little or modest education and living in rural areas, to the changes in reproductive patterns that are now taking place. Those broad segments of Sri Lanka's population appeared to have considerable latent demand for family planning even before Sri Lanka began to undergo major social changes. Sarkar (1957) noted that fertility trends in the 1930's suggested fertility control, but discounted the possibility because he knew of no considerable sale of contraceptives. The explanation was undoubtedly the use of rhythm and withdrawal, information about which was accessible in the literature as family planning manuals in the indigenous languages of both the major communities were in circulation at that time.
Among populations today, contraceptive use is the intermediate fertility variable assumed to be primarily responsible for the wide range in the level of fertility within marriage. The index of contraceptive use (Cc) is equal to 1 in the absence of contraception and to 0 if all fecund women use 100 per cent effective contraception. The index of Cc is estimated from the contraceptive prevalence and effectiveness levels among married women using the equation:

Cc = 1 - 1.08 x ue where u = contraceptive prevalence
among married women of reproductive age, e = average contraceptive use effectiveness, and 1.08 is a sterility adjustment factor.
Method effectiveness has been adopted from the results of the Sri Lanka Rural Family Planning Survey of 1986 (Thapa and Hamill, 1991). Program methods had the highest effectiveness while non-program methods had the lowest; sterilization had the use effectiveness of 0.99 but safe period (rhythm) had the lowest effectiveness (0.62) of any method (Table 3). The results of the calculation of the average use-effectiveness (e) and the index of contraception (Cc) are presented in the lower panel of Table 3; it yields a Cc of 0.426 for the 1987 SLDHS and Cc of 0.476 for the 1982 SLCPS.
ABORTION AND INDEX OF CA
Although induced abortion is recognized as an increasing problem in many parts of the world, little is known about its actual level, especially in countries where there is legal restriction. The index of induced abortion (Ca) equals 1 in the absence of induced abortion and 0 if all pregnancies are aborted. Due to lack of information on induced abortion in the 1982 SLCPS, and in 1987 SLDHS or in any other national study, the index of abortion is omitted from this application. Even though no reliable national estimate could be obtained on abortions in Sri Lanka, because of its illegality, many researchers tend to believe in the emergence of

250

abortion as a fertility control method (Langford, 1982; Caldwell et al., 1987; De Silva, 1991; Perera and Rajapaksa, 1991).
POSTPARTUM INFECUNDABILITY
AND INDEX OF CI
After childbirth a woman experiences temporary infecundability, that is, a period when ovulation does not occur. This is called postpartum amenorrhea. In the absence of breastfeeding, the length of postpartum amenorrhea is usually one or two months after a childbirth. But this period can be extended by intensive and prolonged breastfeeding. The length of postpartum infecundability is found to have a substantial effect on the level of fertility.
The effect of breastfeeding on postpartum amenorrhea differs from one population to another, which may be due to differences in intensity and frequency of breastfeeding. In developing societies, the length of breastfeeding can be longer than one year. The mean duration of breastfeeding in Sri Lanka was 22.7 months in the 1987 SLDHS. Breastfeeding continues for a relatively long period in Sri Lanka and fully 81 per cent of children born 10-11 months ago are still breastfed. The mean duration of postpartum amenorrhea is computed from the mean duration of breastfeeding reported in the 1987 SLDHS; it is obtained by dividing the prevalence of condition (breastfeeding) by the incidence of the condition (Singh et al., 1985). Prevalence is defined as the number of children whose mothers are amenorrheic at the time of the survey. Incidence is defined as the average number of births per month. This average is estimated by

summing the number of births over the last 37 months to overcome problems of seasonality.
The index of postpartum infecundability (Ci) equals 1 in the absence of breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence, and 0 if the duration of infecundability is infinite. The Ci is computed by a straightforward formula, [C/ = 20/(18.5 + 0], where / is the mean duration of postpartum amenorrhea.
The index of Ci for Sri Lanka for the 1987 SLDHS is 0.769. However, for the 1982 SLCPS there is no required information to compute Ci. Therefore, taking the estimated value of Ci (0.612) in the 1975 SLWFS (Casterline et al., 1984), along with the 1987 SLDHS estimate, Ci value for the year 1982 is estimated by using linear interpolation. It resulted in a Ci value of 0.704 for the year 1982. There is evidence from South Asian countries that the duration of postpartum amenorrhea is showing a declining trend (Salway et al., 1992; Ford and Kim, 1987; Knodel et al., 1987; Singh and Ferry, 1985). Presumably the increasing use of contraception may be one of the important contributing factors to the declining trend in postpartum amenorrhea in Sri Lanka.
MULTIPLICATIVE EFFECTS OF
INTERMEDIATE VARIABLES
Empirical observation indicates that although the total marital fertility rate (TM) and total natural fertility rate (7/7V) differ widely among populations, total fecundity rate (TF) is rather stable between 13 and 17 births per woman, with the standard value being 15.3 (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983). It should be noted that, if in a population

all women married early and if breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence, contraception, and induced abortion are not practiced, then the total fecundity rate (TF) is the expected number of children the women will bear during their reproductive period. In the present study the value of TF is taken as 15.3 births per woman.
Table 4 presents the estimated values of the indices of the principal intermediate determinants of fertility. The complement of each index represents the proportionate reduction in fertility attributed to each determinant of fertility; the smaller the index value, the greater is the fertility-inhibiting effect of the variable. TFR, as a measure of the actual level of fertility, is an outcome of the variation in the proximate determinants. Of the indices in the model, marriage index of Cm represents the proportion by which TFR is smaller than TMFR (TM) as a result of a non-marriage. Likewise, the index of Cc provides the proportion by which TM is smaller than TN through the use of contraception, and the index Ci shows by how much TN is smaller than TF due to the effect of postpartum infecundability.
Indices shown in Table 4 indicate that in 1982 the marriage pattern reduces the actual fertility level below marital fertility by 42 per cent (Cm = 0.578). Contraception has the highest effect on marital fertility, attributing a reduction of 52 per cent (Cc = 0.476). Lactational infecundability has the lowest fertility-inhibiting effect, reducing the total fecundity rate (TF) by only 30 per cent (C/=0.704). By 1987, contraceptive prevalence and marriage pattern show an increasing contribution to the decline in fertility,

but the contribution of lactational infecundability to the fertility decline shows the opposite.
During this five-year period (1982 and 1987) a considerable amount of change has occurred in marriage patterns, and contraceptive use; Cm and Cc have declined by 13 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. Thus, the decline in TFR from 3.7 in 1982 to 2.6 in 1987 was caused primarily by the change in marriage patterns and increasing use of contraception. The combined fertility-inhibiting effect of all three intermediate determinants (Cm, Cc and Ci) was 0.194 in 1982 and 0.164 in 1987 indicating a decline of just over 15 per cent in fertility during the period 1982 and 1987.
The relative importance of the fertility-inhibiting effects of each index at two survey points is examined more precisely in Table 5. In this approach, the difference between the total fecundity rate (TF), which is taken as 15.3, and the estimated TFR is attributed to the result of the inhibitory effect produced by the proportion of the logarithm of each index to the sum of the logarithm of all indices (Wang et al., 1987). For example, the fertilityinhibiting effect of the marriage variable is obtained as:
[TF- TFR (estimated)] x logCm/ (logCm + logCc + logCz)
The fertility-inhibiting effects of the other two variables (Cc and Ci) are obtained similarly. For both the years estimated, TFR is obtained by multiplying the total fecundity rate with the combined effect of all three indices (TF x Cmx Ccx Ci). In 1982 a total of 12.3 births were inhibited: 4.1 births (33 per cent) were due to the effect of

the marriage variable; 5.6 births (45 per cent) were due to contraception; 2.6 births (21 per cent) were due to lactational infecundability. In 1987 a total of 12.8 births were inhibited, and the highest reduction, 6 births (47 per cent), was inhibited due to contraception while the lowest, 1.9 children (15 per cent), was inhibited due to lactational infecundability. Clearly the fertility-reducing effect of lactational infecundability has been reduced over the study period.
PHASE OF THE FERTILITY TRANSITION
What are the prospects of future decline of fertility and it's components in Sri Lanka? This question is examined

by placing the current fertility level and the fertility-inhibiting indices of Sri Lanka in a world context. Bongaarts and Potter (1983) classified population into four transition phases according to different fertility levels: (I) TFR over 6.0, mainly in the developing countries; (II) TFR lying between 4.5 and 6.0; (III) TFR between 3.0 and 4.5; and (IV) TFR less than 3.0, mainly in the developed countries. Most populations in Phase I have a fertility level close to that of natural fertility, while populations in Phase IV have completed most or all the fertility transition.
As Caldwell (1994) noted--in his study on the course and causes of fertility decline--of the South Asian

countries Sri Lanka is not far above replacement, as is the case with Thailand in Southeast Asia (Hirschman et al., 1994). When Sri Lankan fertility is compared with those four transition phases in Table 6, it is clear that the TFR of Sri Lanka is very close to that of developed- countries--2.62 compared to 2.06. Sri Lanka is certainly at the latter phase of the fertility transition. The Sri Lankan fertility transition bears greater similarity to that of Europe than to any other part of South Asia. As noted by Caldwell and others (1987), the early introduction of mass education and concurrent changes in the economy and unemployment made large families a disadvantage to many sections of the society.
Fertility-inhibiting indices of the Bongaarts's model of Sri Lanka also reveal a remarkable similarity with the indices of developed countries. The greatest impact of TFR through contraception is observed in Sri Lanka as well as in developed countries. Level

of contraceptive prevalence of 62 per cent in Sri Lanka is fairly closer to the corresponding estimate of 69 per cent prevalence from the developed countries. Even though it seems likely that Sri Lanka will soon follow the changes in many developed countries where modern contraception has increasingly displaced the natural methods, one should not underestimate just how deep-seated is the feeling against much modern contraception.
Of the fertility-inhibiting indices, the index of Cm is found to be lower in Sri Lanka than in developed countries. The index of Ci is also much lower in Sri Lanka than in the developed countries, since the postpartum nonsusceptible period observed in Sri Lanka is longer at 7.5 months compared with a much shorter (about 3 months) period observed in developed countries. The prevailing cultural and social norm in Sri Lanka is unlikely to permit a greater change in the proportion of non-married beyond a certain

limit and prospects for an immediate rise in age at marriage of females over 25 years does not seem to be very bright. On the other hand, the fertilityreducing effect of lactational infecundability is gradually decreasing.
In Sri Lanka, as found in the 1987 survey, there is high motivation to control fertility among married couples. In fact, the survey has shown that the desired total fertility rate of 2.2 children during 1985-87, compared with the observed total fertility rate of 2.6, meaning that if couples had only the children they desired, the total fertility rate would have been 2.2 children instead of 2.6 children (Westoff et al., 1989). Thus, in Sri Lanka a considerable amount of unwanted fertility still takes place. Therefore, further reduction in fertility can be largely expected from the increasing use of contraception combined with higher use-effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION
This study attempted to estimate the fertility-inhibiting effect of the three most important intermediate determinants, namely marriage, contraception, and lactational infecundability. Data on induced abortion are not available, and its effect remains unmeasurable. Observed fertility of Sri Lanka had declined to a fairly low level of 2.6 births per woman by 1985-87. The finding of this study gives evidence of the success of the major role played by the family planning program and the government population policy. Average annual growth of population of Sri Lanka is now at just 1 per cent, which is much lower than all the South Asian countries.

Estimated indices of the Bongaarts's model indicated that the most important inhibitor of potential fertility is deliberate control, with contraception being able to reduce potential fertility by almost one-half, while non-marriage (Cm) is able to reduce fertility by one-quarter. The fertilityinhibiting effect of lactational infecundability is relatively unimportant in Sri Lanka, but certainly is more influential than that found in the developed countries. The analysis suggests that the fertility-reducing effect of contraception is steadily increasing, but the effect of lactational infecundability shows the opposite. The fertilityreducing effect of the marriage variable is also increased over the period 1982 and 1987.
Sri Lanka has long been known as a poor country whose significant fertility decline resulted from the combination of a well-organized, noncoercive family planning program with low mortality and high female status (Caldwell, 1987; Freedman, 1995). From the policy point of view, for the first time, the Sri Lankan government set the target of achieving a TFR of 2.1 equal to replacement level by the year 2000 in its population policy statement issued in 1991 (Ministry of Health, 1992). However, additional effort will be required from family planning during this decade to reach this target as the number of women entering reproductive ages will be much larger than the number that entered during the previous decades. More than 200,000 new acceptors of family planning will need to be recruited annually to reach the contraceptive prevalence rate of 72 per cent by the end of the decade to achieve the replacement fertility.
