Questions on marital status and number of children ever born to ever-married women were asked in the last four decennial censuses of the United States. The answers give an excellent opportunity to study the changes in marriage and fertility of American women over a period of more than thirty years. The changes for white and nonwhite women considered separately are particularly interesting because these two groups traditionally have shown different patterns of reproductive behavior.
In this paper, I shall explore only two facets of fertility--nonmarriage and childlessness--for white and nonwhite women. It is necessary, however, to avoid mistaken interpretations of the data and to utilize the best techniques available for cohort analysis. Unless care is exercised, one may think that the census data show that white women have increasingly been marrying and that childlessness among them has been decreasing. For nonwhite women, the data seem to show an even more drastic drop in childlessness but a slow increase in the percentage of women who remain single (Tables 1 and 3).

These conclusions based on figures in census reports are correct only if we accept them as describing cohorts. They do not tell us about marriage or fertility in the census years. For instance, the proportion of women aged 45 in the "ever-married" category in 1970 gives a cumulative thirtyyear picture of the cohort born in 1925. Their proportion ever-married is obviously not determined by the age-specific first-marriage rates of women in 1970, but rather by the cohort rates during all the years before that back to 1940. To obtain a picture of the 1970 situation, one has to think in terms of a synthetic cohort. One has to imagine women living to age 45 marrying for the first time at the agespecific first-marriage rates of 1970.
I shall apply this synthetic cohort technique to elucidate the trends in nonmarriage and childlessness among white and nonwhite women in the United States. The results are significantly different from the real cohort rates provided by the census. We shall find that, among white women, both nonmarriage and childlessness have increased rather than decreased in recent years and that, among nonwhite

women, there has been a significant increase in nonmarriage and only a slight decline in childlessness.
PERIOD RATES OF SPINSTERHOOD
The percentages of never-married (single) women aged 40-44 in four consecutive censuses are given in the upper half of Table 1. As we indicated earlier, the

of single women aged 40-44 that will be indicative of the marriage situation in 1970, we must obtain that figure on the basis of the age-specific first-marriage rates of 1970, as we obtain the period life table for 1970 from the age-specific death rates of 1970. Once we do that, the resulting figure may turn out to be quite different from 5.2,depending on the marriage condition in 1970.

in the present problem, is the same as assuming that the marital status composition remains unaffected by these two components of population change. From a simple law of probability, we can write:

The probability that a woman aged

x + 10 in 1950 is single = (the proba-

bility that a woman aged x in 1940 is

single) X (the probability that a single

woman aged x in 1940 will remain single

at a g e s + 1 0 in 1950).

We denote the second probability on the right side of equation (1) by iopx. Expressing the probabilities in the form of ratios (i.e., favorable cases/equally likely cases), we can rewrite equation (1) as

Thus, for 3 = 1 7 . 5 , we obtain from the census, for women aged 25-30 in 1950, 731,190 single women out of 5,625,840 total women. For women aged 15-20 in 1940, we obtain 4,778,960 single women out of 5,377,020 total women. Thus,
731,190/5,625,840 = 0.146.
4,778,960/5,377,020
All the probabilities toPx can be obtained in a similar way. We note that for * = 7.5 and 12.5, the number of single women is equal to the number of total women in the age group (x -- 2.5, x + 2.5).

This number is 35 (i.e., 3.5 per cent) for white women in 1940-50. All such numbers (in terms of 100) are put together in the lower half of Table 1.
It is interesting to note that the numbers corresponding to census years and those corresponding to decades in Table 1 lead

I t may be mentioned here that in 1940 and 1950 duration of marriage (or age at marriage) is given only for women married once and husband present, and this makes it impossible to extend our analysis to broken marriages even if we wanted to do so. Some analysis of childlessness based on 1960 census data has been done by Mitra (1966), Kunz and Brinkerhoff (1969), and Veevers (1971).

confronted with the problem of finding the period percentages for a decade that are free from the effects of women's behaviors with respect to age patterns of marriage and first births prior to that decade. Contrary to our belief, the percentages for census years in Table 3 show significant reductions in childlessness in recent years. Again, we ask ourselves the question: What percentage of marriedwomen would remain childless up to the end of the childbearing period if all of them marry once, survive, remain married to the end of the childbearing period, and are subjected to the age-specific rates of first marriage and first-birth as shown, for example, by the white women in the decade 1960-70?
To answer this question, we have to first construct childlessness tables by age at marriage, similar to the marriage tables in Table 2. The basic data needed for these tables are the number of childless

and total women, married once and husband present, by age and duration of marriage. Representing ages and durations by their midpoints (the errors due to this assumption are expected to cancel out) and noting that the difference between the present age and the duration of marriage gives the age at marriage, we construct the childlessness tables as shown in Table 4.
Let us take for illustration the childlessness table for white women in the decade 1940-50 corresponding to age-at-marriage 15. Ignoring again the effect of migration and mortality on the parity composition of women, let us denote by ioP» the probability that a childless woman (married once at age 15 and husband present) aged * in 1940 will remain childless at age x + 1 0 in 1950, given that her marital status does not change during the decade. As in equations (1) and (2), we can express this probability as

the probability that a woman (married once at age 15 and husband present) aged x -f- 10 in 1950 is childless the probability that a woman (married once at age 15 and husband present) aged x in 1940 is childless

childless women/total women [married once at age 15 and husband present, in the age group (x + 7.5, x -f- 12.5) in 1950] childless women/total women [married once at age 15 and' husband present, in the age group (x -- 2.5, x + 2.5) in 1940]

x = 7 . 5 , 12.5,

32.5.

(4)

Let us calculate this probability for x = 17.5. For white women, married once and husband present, we have the following data from the census: For women aged 25-30 married 10-15 years in 1950, there are 40,380 childless women out of a total of 663,840 women. For women aged 15-20 married 0-5 years in 1940, there are 207,560 childless women out of a total of 398,440 women. From these figures we obtain
40,380/663,840 207,560/398,440 = 0.117.

We define C» as the number of childless women (married once and husband present) at age x out of a marriage cohort of 1,000 ( = Co) women with age at marriage a. For all x ^a, Cx= 1,000, and for other x values, C* is calculated from the equation
Cx = C3-10 X l(vPa-10j
* = a + 2.5,a+7.5,...,42.5. (5)
For example, C27.5 is obtained from the product of C17.5 (=553) and 10P1T.5 (=0.117) as 65. Here again, the last

This percentage and other similar figures are shown in the lower half of Table 3.
It is evident from the decade figures in Table 3 that childlessness among white women has increased and that among nonwhite women it has remained virtually unchanged in the last decade, although the census figures in the same table show a sharp reduction in childlessness for both categories. It may also be concluded from the decade figures in Table 3--contrary to the indications in the census figures in this table that nonwhite women still have a much higher percentage of childlessness-- that there is essentially no difference in the extent of childlessness between white and nonwhite women in the United States at the present time.

riage and fertility behavior of the cohorts of women born several decades ago, they fail to indicate the rates at which the current women are marrying or bearing children. Any attempt to infer the latter from the census rates may even lead to diametrically opposite conclusions, as we have shown in this paper. Or, in other words, we need to study singleness and childlessness from the period point of view. We have therefore provided in this paper the period measures of these two phenomena for the white and nonwhite women in the United States from the census data of 1940, 19S0, 1960, and 1970. The technique of constructing a synthetic cohort for a decade is used to find the period rates for the three decades 194050, 1950-60, and 1960-70.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
A demographic phenomenon can be looked at from two different angles, namely, the cohort approach and the period approach. Neither of them can claim to be superior to or serve as a substitute for the other. The decision to choose one approach in preference to the other rests entirely on the objective of the study. If, for example, we are particularly interested in the fertility behavior of women who were born in 1930, we fix that cohort and may want to study, as they grow up, their age-specific fertility rates corresponding to different points of time. On the other hand, if we are interested in the fertility pattern of the women in 1970, we fix the time and may want to examine their age-specific rates corresponding to different cohorts. The former is obviously a cohort study, and the latter, a period study.
The extent of singleness or childlessness among women who have completed their childbearing years can be read directly from the census reports. While these data give useful information about the mar-

The salient findings of the paper are given in Tables 1 and 3. Table 1 presents the census (cohort) rates and the decade (period) rates of singleness among white and nonwhite women aged 40-44. The decade rates provide answers to the following type of question: If 100 women are born together and survive to the end of the childbearing period and if, as they grow up, they are subjected to the agespecific first-marriage rates typical of white women in the decade 1960-70, how many of them are expected to remain single (never-married) up to the end of the childbearing period? These rates have increased over the last three decades for both white and nonwhite women. However, compared to white women, the nonwhite percentages have grown at a much faster rate between the first two decades and at a slower rate between the last two decades. Starting at about the same level in 1940-50, the per cent single among nonwhite women becomes about twice that for white women in 1960-70. I t is interesting to note that all these conclusions that we draw from the decade rates are not at all
