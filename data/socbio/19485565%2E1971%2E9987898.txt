The purpose of this paper is to report the effects of contraceptive pills on the frequency of sexual activity as observed during a double-blind placebo study in which various parameters of behavior were noted daily.
In studies previous to this, we obtained evidence suggesting that estrogen increases and progesterone decreases the probability of sexual activity in humans (Udry and Morris, 1968). A large body of data shows that these hormones do thus influence mating behavior in Rhesus monkeys (Michael, 1968). It follows that because of their hormonal nature, contraceptive pills might biologically afFect sexual behavior. Michael (1968) has shown this is indeed the case in the Rhesus. When the female monkey receives a combined mestranol and ethynodiol diacetate contraceptive, her male partner becomes less and less efficient in reaching ejaculation, and after six or seven months may not ejaculate at all despite prolonged efforts. When she receives mestranol, then mestranol with chlormadinone acetate in sequential fashion, her partner becomes less efficient but is not quite so handicapped as in the former instance (Michael, 1969).
In humans, in all careful studies to date of the side effects of contraceptive pills, it has been concluded that there is no signifi-

cant effect on sexual behavior. When changes have been reported, they have usually related to a small proportion of the women studied, and they are about as likely to consist of an increase as a decrease. Behavior has been measured in terms of subjective changes in female libido, or subjective assessment of changes in average frequency of intercourse, through questions such as, "For the last cycle, please indicate whether you had orgasm never , sometimes , or frequent ; whether you had intercourse once per month , twice per month , once a week , or, twice or more a week ; whether your libido was frigid , weak , or marked " Methodological problems seriously limit the reliability of previous findings in humans (Garcia, 1967; Wallach, 1968; Goldzieher, 1968; Rodgers andZiegler, 1968; Nilsson and Solvell, 1968; Bakke, 1965; Kane 1969; Kane, Treadway, and Ewing, 1969).
One study, however, is particularly convincing concerning the potential of certain oral contraceptives to cause decrease of sexual activity. Grant and Mears (1967) recorded the complaints of women receiving many different contraceptive agents and found that highly progestogenic formulations (combined pills) caused up to 34% of those taking them to complain of depression

and loss of libido, while highly estrogenic regimes (sequentials) caused these complaints far less often. Now that highly estrogenic pills are suspect because of an apparently greater association with thromboembolic disease, it is even more important to find out whether or not progestogenic contraceptives affect sexual activity, and how much progestogen it takes. We selected for this experiment agents containing 2 mg of norethindrone, an amount of progestogen much less than those used in earlier formulations, but more than that in current use or projected for the future.
In this study we assume that physiological effects on sexual behavior due to contraceptive pills will be prominent during the first two cycles of use, as are other physiological effects about which complaints are common (nausea, tender breasts, breakthrough bleeding, etc.) (Goldzieher, 1968; Tyler et al., 1964, 1966; Board, 1966). Psychological effects are controlled through the use of a placebo comparison group.
Although long-range physiological effects on sexual behavior also deserve attention, we cannot address ourselves to this problem here. Masters and Johnson have anecdotally reported that after two to three years of contraceptive pill use some women find it more difficult to attain orgasm (see McCary, 1967). Since progesterone in large doses is said to have a sedative effect on female sexual behavior (Greenblatt, 1952), we look to our data to show whether a small dose will directly influence female response.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Married women currently contracepting by some method other than the use of a contraceptive pill were recruited to take part in the study. Women were not accepted: if they had used a contraceptive pill or had been pregnant in the previous three months; if they had used a contraceptive pill in the past, but had to give it up because of side effects or medical contraindications; or if

they had some contraindication to oral contraceptive use at the time of the study. Twenty-five participants were recruited from a group of women attending public family-planning clinics and forty-five were recruited through invitations to graduatestudent wives and to women in a religious congregation. The women were paid to participate. Of the 70 women originally recruited, 7 dropped out on their own (2 because of weight loss and cramps, respectively, which they attributed to to the medication; and 5 presumably because of changing their minds about participating), and 7 were asked to drop out by the research staff because of failure to follow directions accurately. The final group consisted of 56 women, 15 from the clinics and 41 from the other groups. Of the 56,5 were flagged because of irregularities in their data contributions and were dropped from the analysis reported here. It should be noted that adding their data does not significantly affect the results. Graduate-student wives were most heavily represented in the 51 remaining.
The women were randomly divided into three groups. All were to record daily on a data slip covering the previous 24 hours whether or not they had menstruated, whether they had had intercourse and/or orgasm, their daily mileage clocked on a pedometer, and the answers to questions about how they felt and whether or not their husbands had wanted intercourse. These slips were mailed into the research office daily in pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes.
For the first cycle of participation (beginning with the first day of a menstrual period and bracketed by the next menstrual bleeding), the women in all three groups wore pedometers and sent in their daily slips. After the first cycle, one group took mestranol 0.1 mg combined with norethindrone 2.0 mg (Ortho-Novum-2); the second group took 0.08 mg mestranol, then in the last six pills of each cycle 0.08 mg mestranol combined

in the cycle. When data were missing, however, for any cycle day, calculations were based only on those days for which data were available. There was no significant difference in the frequency of intercourse across the three groups of women or between one cycle and any of the others (two-tailed /-test applied; P = 0.05 level of probability used for determination of significance throughout the analysis).
Table 3 shows the rate of orgasm per cycle (observation) day. Rates were derived as indicated above. There was no significant difference in the frequency of orgasm across the three groups of women or between one cycle and any of the others.
Table 4 shows the rate of orgasm per intercourse. This rate was derived by dividing the number of orgasms reported by the number of days in which intercourse was

also reported. Although it appears that the group receiving the placebo had a lower rate of orgasm per intercourse, there was no significant difference among the three groups or between any of the cycles compared to any other.
In order to discover whether age might influence the effects of the contraceptive pills, the data were analyzed as above after breaking into halves at the median age. No changes emerged.
Because of the allegation that contraceptive pills affect the capacity of women to respond with orgasm and because our initial analysis revealed no change, we divided the groups according to whether the women's orgasm rates were above or below the median rate and looked to see whether perhaps the response of more orgasmic women was affected differently from that of less orgasmic women. No difference appeared.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The women participating in this study knew that they might be in a group receiving placebo only and that although the pills being studied were oral contraceptives, they had to continue their regular method of contraception to avoid pregnancy. We believe this situation tended to minimize the women's expectations for any change in sexual activity due to the medication; at least it did not cause alteration in the usual pattern of coitus-related preparation.
I t is possible that women who had used oral contraceptives in the past and felt their sexual lives had been adversely affected did not volunteer to take part in the study (causing an underrepresentation of susceptible women). Women reporting any serious reactions were discouraged from participating. On the other hand, several volunteers stated they felt that the pills had affected their emotional well-being in the past, and they were interested in the experiment to find out if it had been "all in the mind." At the end they were informed what they had been given and were allowed to judge for themselves. The most serious appearing and persistent complaints came from two women who were given placebo. There actually were no complaints relating to "libido" or sexual frequency.
Our data for the first two cycles of use of these particular oral contraceptives are clear: Average sexual frequency is not affected. Considering that 2 mg of norethindrone is a considerably larger amount of progestogen than that in current use in combined pills, and a tremendously greater amount than the microdoses projected for the future, the results suggest that depres-

sion of sexual frequency due to a direct physiological effect of progestogens used as contraceptive agents will not be a problem. This does not preclude changes which might occur later, perhaps secondary to other effects of the hormonal contraceptives on the body.
We believe this study makes one further contribution. I t demonstrates a means of separating physiological and psychological effects of contraceptive pills, a problem which has been considered very difficult but necessary to solve (Wallach and Garcia, 1968; Kane et al., 1969).
SUMMARY
The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of contraceptive pills on the frequency of sexual activity. Fifty-one married women contracepting by some means other than contraceptive pills were divided at random into three groups to receive placebo, mestranol 0.1 mg and norethindrone 2 mg, or mestranol 0.08 mg, then mestranol 0.08 mg with norethindrone 2 mg, in a double-blind fashion for two cycles, after one cycle of observation without medication. Reports of sexual intercourse, orgasm, and other data were mailed daily to the investigators. No significant change in average sexual frequency was observed as a consequence of the medication.
