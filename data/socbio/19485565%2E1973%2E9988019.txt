Recent demographic studies of black Americans have indicated that the growth of this population will be most influenced by fertility trends (Farley, 1970). In light of this observation, it is somewhat puzzling to discover a fairly substantial gap in the literature with regard to the determinants of black fertility. Although the negative association between socioeconomic status (SES) and black fertility has been well documented (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1971a), possible determinants within the various SES levels have been unexplored. Most studies have examined the influence of a number of demographic variables on the fertility of the total black American population. The present study explores the hypothesis that these traditional demographic fertility determinants may have a differential impact within SES levels of the black population.
Previous investigations (Farley, 1970; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 197Iff, b) have found that the number of children a woman has in her lifetime will be influenced by various social and economic characteristics including rural-urban residence, educational attainment, labor force status, the occupation of her husband, and the income of her family. In the present study, these and

other variables previously found to be associated with black fertility are examined for a national sample of blacks with a high level of educational attainment.
This procedure has the effect of controlling the impact of education, one indicator of SES, on fertility. The research question may be stated as follows: After the influence of high education on fertility has been controlled (black doctorates only), will traditional demographic variables continue to exert an influence on black fertility? If so, how much? Variables to be examined include: parent's fertility, region of birth, rural-urban origins, father's occupation, father's education, present income, region of present residence and religion. Although in the present study, SES does not vary, this third variable is assumed to intervene between the independent variables mentioned above and fertility, except in the case of income, residence, and religion where the temporal ordering is not clear.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Data for the present study were collected as part of a larger investigation into the career patterns of black American academic doctorates (Mommsen, 1970). Black professionals are represented in the present

study by a national nonprobability sample
of black American doctorates, which con-
stitutes approximately one-third of the
known population.1
The initial methodological problem of
the present research was the accurate iden-
tification of a population from which to
draw a sample. Since no current listing of
all living black American doctorates existed,
a variety of methods were employed in de-
veloping a master mailing list.2 A master
mailing list of 2,305 names and addresses
of persons believed to be in the population
was compiled. After two waves of mail
questionnaires, 1,384 responses were ob-
tained. Of these returns, 317 were unde-
Iiverable,3 281 (20.3%) were not in the
population being studied,4 and 785 were
usable questionnaires. The overwhelming
reason for a respondent's eliminating him-
1Bond (1967) estimated that there were approximately 1,600 to 1,800 living blacks who held the doctoral degree (yearly production of about 160 or 1% of the annual American output). The Ford Foundation survey (1969) identified 2,280 living black American doctorates, excluding M.D., D.D.S. and D.V.M. degrees. The present sample of 78S is 34% of this estimate.
2 Letters were sent to various persons and organizations known to have partial lists of the population to be studied. The author is indebted to Drs. Horace Mann Bond, Thomas D. Jarrett, and Mack Jones, all of Atlanta University and James E. Conyers of Indiana State University for their generous cooperation in this regard. The primary source used was a list maintained for many years through 1959 by the late Dr. Rufus E. Clement, former president of Atlanta University. Several sources were used to verify, update, and supplement the Clement list: American Men of Science: A Biographical Directory (1968), The World of Learning 1968-69, Directory of American Scholars: A Biographical Directory (1969), Who's Who in American Education (1968), James E. Conyers' list of black doctorates in sociology, Mack Jones' list of black doctorates in political science, and the available college catalogs of the 85 institutions listed in the Directory of Predominantly Negro Colleges and Universities in the United Slates of America (1969).
3 These questionnaires were undeliverable because the addressee was either deceased or his current address was unknown.
4If any respondent was not in the population being studied by virtue of his race, citizenship, or academic achievement, he was requested to return the unanswered questionnaire.

self was that he was Caucasian.5 It was
therefore reasoned that a similar percentage
of the nonrespondents would also have been
eliminated from the study had they re-
sponded. Hence, it was estimated that some
187 nonrespondents (20.3%) would not
have been in the population. The rate of
response for the present study using an adjusted6 base figure was 52%.
Since the parameters of the total popula-
tion of black American doctorates are un-
known, the representativeness of the
present sample cannot be established. The
possibility, however, that the present
sample is grossly atypical has been shown
to be unlikely by establishing "compara-
bility" with the recent and more extensive
Ford Foundation survey (Bryant, 1969) of the same population.7 Two possible biases,
older respondents age "60 and over" and
respondents from the South, have been dis-
cussed elsewhere (Mommsen, 1970, pp. 39-
41). Although it is unlikely that either bias
would have much impact on fertility, if it
did, the tendency would be to reduce the
over-all fertility of the sample (see Table 2
and 4), since the oldest respondents and
5 The procedure of obtaining the names and addresses of all doctorates listed in black college bulletins is responsible for this outcome. Although persons of obvious non-Negroid ethnic origin could be excluded immediately (e.g., Chinese), Caucasians were difficult to eliminate.
6 The original base figure of 2,305 was reduced by 317 undeliverables, 381 respondents not in the population, and 187 estimated nonrespondents not in the population. The adjusted base figure is 1,520. Although a 52% rate of return may appear low, this should probably be compared with other recent attempts to survey this same population. Using extremely short questionnaires and more "legitimate" bases for research, Bond (1967) obtained a 57% return and Bryant (1969) a 48% return. The present questionnaire was more sensitive and longer (16 pages) than either of these studies (see Mommsen, 1970).
7 Details of this argument can be found in Mommsen (1970, pp. 40-41) where data on five common variables are presented: age at time of survey, time for completing degree requirements, age at which doctorate was received, sex,and field in which degrees were conferred.

those from the South reported the lowest
fertility.
Fertility, the dependent variable in the
present investigation, was measured by
asking respondents: "How many children have you had?"8 Respondents who were
separated, divorced, or widowed (10.4% of
the sample) did respond to the fertility
question and were included in the final
analysis. Twenty never-married singles re-
porting children, however, were eliminated
from the sample along with other nevermarried singles.9 Only 1% of the total
sample (N = 785) failed to respond to the
fertility item.
RESULTS
Black doctorates report smaller families
than do either whites or all black Amer-
8One possible problem with the wording of this item is its failure to clearly distinguish between biological and adopted children. The census uses the following wording to overcome this difficulty: "How many babies have you ever had, not counting stillbirths?" This question was asked of women who were reported as married, separated, widowed, or divorced. Single never-married women were presumed to be childless (U.S. Bureau of the Census, November 1969, p. 4).
9 This decision is based primarily on convention. Since reliability comes into question with regard to self-reported illegitimate births, it is probably unwise to use such data. The possibility of coding error is also a consideration. The number of never-married singles reporting children was quite small (N = 20). A total of 44 children, however, was reported by these respondents: 8 reported one child; 4 reported two; 5 reported three; 2 reported four; and 1 reported five children.

icans (Table 1). The median number of children for this sample of ever-married black professionals is 1.76, compared with 2.49 for all blacks and 2.15 for whites. Black doctorates were found to be less likely than other black Americans to have four, five, or more children. Where 8% of these black professionals have had four children, almost 12% of the general black population reported this number. Even more striking is the low incidence of five or more children: 5% among black doctorates compared with 11% of the white population and 25% of all blacks. Further, black doctorates report a greater incidence of childlessness (19%) than either whites (15%) or other blacks (13%). Finally, more black doctorates have one or two children than other Americans. Although the evidence is indirect, strong support for the upward mobility hypothesis is suggested by these data. That is, black professionals, like their white counterparts, seem to consciously limit fertility in an effort to consolidate financial resources and maximize upward mobility.

age categories reflects more precisely the nature of this relationship. With the exception of the youngest age category in which small numbers is a problem, the median number of children is found to be inversely related to age. This mild negative relationship was to be expected since a similar relationship is found in the general black population between the ages of 3S and 44 years (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969).10

In order to control for this effect of age on fertility, a standardization procedure was employed using the full sample as the standard population (Rosenberg, 1962). Hence, in standardized tables 4 through 9, fertility percentages have been weighted according to the proportions of the sample in the several age intervals.

completed fertility of parents.11 Therefore, only ever-married black doctorates age 45 or more, whose fertility was assumed completed, were included in this subsample (iV = 526).
No relationship was found between parents' and respondents' fertility (G = --0.00) in this subsample. The data suggest that number of siblings is not a powerful variable in predicting completed fertility of black American doctorates. Only-child respondents, for example, were most likely to have two children (48%). Respondents from two child families, on

REGION OF RESIDENCE
Since persistent and substantial regional differences in childbearing have been found in the black population in general, this variable was examined for the present sample. Examining ratios of children ages 0 to 4 to women IS to 44, Farley (1970) reports that black women who live in the South have been more fertile than women outside the South at each date for which information is available from 1880 through 1967.
This regional differential, however, did not hold for the black professionals examined in the present study. Table 4 pre-

the other hand, were most likely to produce an "only child" family (35%). Respondents coming from families of three or more were most likely to have less than three children. Similarly, an examination of median number of children by parents' fertility revealed no apparent relationship. No matter how many siblings respondents had, no stable pattern emerged with regard to how many children they would have upon completion of the childbearing period.

sents the age-standardized relationship between region of residence and fertility. With age controlled, the fertility of black doctorates was not found to be greater in the South than in other regions. On the contrary, the median number of children was found to be lower for residents of the South (1.71) than for residents of the Northeast (1.93), North Central (1.96) or Western (2.67) regions. It appears likely that increased geographic mobility of the present sample, compared with all black women, might account for the disappearance of this relationship.

RURAL-URBAN ORIGINS
Demographers have observed (Farley, 1970) that women whoare reared in rural areas have different fertility patterns than those raised in cities.
In the present sample, respondents were asked to indicate the approximate size of their hometown: "Before reaching eighteen years of age,where was most of your life spent?" These data are somewhat unique since United States censuses have not asked women if they were reared in rural or urban areas.
The influence on fertility of being raised in a rural background is examined in Table

5. Interestingly, the traditional rural-urban (hometown before 18 years of age) differential is upheld for the black professionals in the sample. Respondents raised in "large urban" communities had the fewest children (1.64) followed by "medium urban" (1.79) and "rural" (1.83). I t should be noted, however, that the differences are quite small.
SOCIOECONOMIC ORIGINS
The effect of the respondents' original SES on fertility was examined by using father's occupation (Table 6) and father's education (Table 7). Neither of these SES

variables appeared to be strongly related to fertility of the respondents when age was controlled. A comparison of medians in extreme categories, however, does reveal a slight inverse relationship as might be expected: 0.11 of a child less in the case of high occupations and 0.13 of a child less in the case of a college education.
PRESENT SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS
Two frequently used indicators of SES are a man's income and his educational attainment. Since, for the present sample, no variation exists with regard to education (all respondents had doctorates), analysis was restricted to examining differentials in fertility by annual income for 1970. Table 8

presents the relationship between annual income (1970) and fertility, with age controlled. Data here are again unique since the variation being examined is all at the upper end of the income distribution ($7,000 or more). Previous studies (Farley, 1970) for example, have lumped all blacks earning "five thousand dollars or more" into one category. Table 8 shows that when only high income black professionals are examined, the inverse relationship between income and fertility is not obtained. An interesting pattern, however, does emerge with regard to childlessness.
Farley (1970) has reported that childlessness was not linked to socioeconomic variables in any systematic manner. That

is, in 1960, the proportion of black wives who were childless was pretty much the same regardless of the husband's income (about 18-20%). For the present sample, about this level of childlessness is maintained for incomes of less than $17,000 in 1970. A fairly sharp drop in childlessness, however, is noted for those black professionals earning more than $17,000 dollars. Less than 12% of those couples earning $25,000 or more were childless, a rate considerably lower than the general black population in 1960 (19%). It is not known if a comparable drop in childlessness exists for whites with incomes exceeding $17,000 since the top category for census tabulations is "$ 15,000 and over."
RELIGION
Three-fourths of the black doctorates in the sample were affiliated with Protestant religions. The effect of religion on fertility was examined in Table 9 by comparing

sionals, the median number of children was found to be 0.38 of a child greater for Catholics than for Protestants. Further, Catholics were much more likely to have large families of five or more children (13%) than any other religious affiliation represented (3-4%).
DISCUSSION
This investigation into the fertility of a national sample of black doctorates has provided fairly strong, although indirect, support for the notion that black professionals, like their white counterparts, consciously limit fertility (upward mobility hypothesis). Although direct evidence of this link is not provided, the lower fertility of black professionals compared with other blacks and whites is clear. Black professionals in the sample averaged 1.76 children, almost one full child less than blacks in general (0.73 of a child). Childlessness was found to be greater among black pro-

Although most respondents had about two children, at least one religious differential remained. Even among black profes-

fessionals (19%) than all blacks (13%). Most striking was the low incidence of large families of five or more children among black professionals: 5% compared with 25% for all blacks.
Comparisons, however, of the present

sample with census tabulations involve several limitations that should be mentioned. First, ever-married black doctorates of both sexes are compared with evermarried women only (21% of the sample were females). This comparison is rationalized by assuming that each male respondent represents the fertility of his wife. The fact that some male respondents were married more than once may introduce some distortion, but this problem is believed to be slight.
A second and perhaps more severe limitation involves the ages of both samples. Black doctorates in the sample vary in age from 25 to 83 years, whereas census data report age-specific fertility on women between the ages of 15 and 44 years only. Almost three-fourths of the total sample in the present study are over 44 years of age.
Third, fertility data collected from April through June of 1970 (black doctorates) are compared with January 1969 data for all blacks and all whites. Although more recent census data are available, the January 1969 data were used due to their greater proximity in time to the present study and the fact that the two census reports did not vary a great deal.12
Finally, the problem of external validity in the present study should be mentioned.

1 2 Both census reports were collected about fifteen months from the present study. Percentage distribution on children ever born for black women between 15-44 years are as follows:

June 1971

15.0 11.8 22.8 100.0

Although changes are small, the data do indicate that increasing proportions of black Americans are having two or three children (4% increase) rather than larger or smaller families.

The present sample of black American doctorates, although large for this particular universe, is a nonprobability sample. The parameters of the universe are unknown. Possible biases with regard to region and age have been mentioned.13 Strong generalizations, then, to the universe of black American doctorates would be severely constrained due to problems of possible sampling bias and the unknown status of nonrespondents. Further, only academic doctorates were sampled. Other black professionals such as lawyers, physicians, and businessmen may have yet different fertility patterns. Nevertheless, the present study is believed to be the first intensive investigation into the fertility of a fairly large sample of black professionals of any kind.
Hopefully, further studies can take these methodological problems into account. Future studies are needed also to explore the degree to which relationships examined here are "attenuated." The degree of attenuation has remained problematic since comparable data for all blacks on these same relationships were not obtained.
