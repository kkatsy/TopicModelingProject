Social and demographic structures are fundamental determinants of the genetic structures of human populations (CavalliSforza, 1962; Sutter, 1963; Spuhler, 1963; Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza, 1967).
Some relationships and interactions between sociodemographic and genetic parameters of human populations have been studied. Theoretical and empirical precedents in North American Indian population research have been set by Spuhler and Kluckhohn (1953), Hulse (1955), Kraus and White (1956), Woolf and Grant (1962), Woolf (1965), Hackenberg (1967, 1972), Walker (1967), Woolf and Dukepoo (1969), Workman and Niswander (1970), Smith (1972), and others.
These investigations notwithstanding, genetic demography has been belatedly and restrictedly incorporated into the designs and strategies of research on North American Indian populations.
Genetic and epidemiologic research in North American reservation communities has suggested hypothetical relationships between these population structures and prevalent diseases which are otherwise rare in North America (e.g., Corrigan and Segal, 1950; Birt, 1968; Niswander, 1968;

Ives, 1969). However, hypothesis testing has been restricted by lack of data collected within a context appropriate to genetic analyses. The requisite course to such analyses is through an integrated application of social, genetic, and demographic methods in population research (e.g., WHO, 1964, 1968, 1971).
THE GREATER LEECH LAKE RESERVATION PROJECT
Research on the demographic-genetic structure of the Ojibwa population, resident at Greater Leech Lake Reservation in northern Minnesota, was initiated in 1966. Initial objectives included: (1) description of the blood group and serum protein genetic variation within the contemporary population; (2) description of the demographic structures of the reservation and its communities; and (3) analysis of social, demographic, and genetic components of the population structure.
The present report includes: (1) a general characterization of the reservation system and population; (2) description of our research strategy and methods; (3) general observations on the demographic samples

(LWVM, 1971).

THE RESERVATION SYSTEM AND POPULATION
The Greater Leech Lake Indian Reservation is located in the north-central region of the state of Minnesota.
The reservation is an "open" system, the origin of which has been described by Roufs (1967). In 1970, 26,766 acres of land, 5% of the original reservation, was held as Indian trust or government land. Individual allotments accounted for 12,963 acres, while tribal land included 14,069 acres (BIA, 1970). This division contrasts with the 564,426 acres of tribal land, 100% of the original reservation, characteristic of the "closed" Red Lake reservation in northern Minnesota.
The open system gave rise to clusters of Indian and non-Indian residents in the area once given entirely to reservation. In some cases, Indian communities were appended to those of the growing non-Indian population. In others, the population was primarily of Ojibwa ethnic affinity.1 The distribution of these communities, within the reservation and/or Chippewa National Forest, is illustrated in Figure 1.
Lakes, swamps, rivers, and streams are the major geographic features affecting community distribution. The average annual rainfall is approximately 27 inches. Seasonality is extreme, temperatures ranging between highs of over 90 degrees in July and August and lows of 40 degrees below zero in December and January (GLLSU, 1965).
The economy of the region is depressed
1 Ethnic and linguistic affiliation are not implicitly correlated with and through geneticdemographic derivation. Among communities on the Leech Lake Reservation, several have exhibited strong cultural or ethnic affiliation with Ojibwa in association with the highest estimates of admixture with non-Indians.

1. Median family income for the total reservation population of Indians and non-Indians in 1969 was $1,500.
2. Eighty per cent of Indian and nonIndian families had annual incomes below the $3,000 U.S. Government poverty limit.
3. Seventy per cent of the Indian families are in substandard housing, 50% without running water or sewage disposal.
RESEARCH STRATEGY
The size of the resident population required a sampling method.2 Dispersal of reservation communities and economic considerations dictated use of a single sampling locale. The U.S. Public Health Service Indian Hospital, located in the village of Cass Lake, was selected. Advantages of this locale included:
1. the hospital as a comprehensive health facility, utilized by the total "registered" reservation population;
2. a staff to collect serological specimens for genetic analyses;
3. a source of health records for use in the demographic characterization of the population.
We assumed that the reservation hospital would present a random sample from the population and each of the villages. However, the size of the sample from each village was assumed to be affected by actual size and distance from the sampling locale.3
2 Available estimates of the resident Indian population in 1968 averaged approximately 2,400 individuals. Primary among our concerns was a genetic characterization of the demographic population from which the sample was drawn.
3 In studies of genetic differentiation, the sample drawn from a village, region, etc., should reproduce that proportionate contribution to the total population. In actual experience, distance

units was countered by sampling families through individuals, without replacement. Once an individual from a family was sampled, the members of that family unit were removed, for sampling purposes, from the remaining population of the village. Sampling units, ascertained through the individual demographic-genetic index cases, were denned as nuclear families. These, in

turn, were utilized as the points from which demographic records of extended family units were constructed.
Hospital staff were instructed to select, as randomly as possible, those individuals from whom a serological specimen was to be drawn. Restriction on sampling was exercised in cases of severe acute or chronic disease and children under five years of age. An alphabetic list of individuals and families sampled was provided to hospital technicians as a control over multiple ascertainments.
Four primary sources of demographic data were used to establish the record for each index case. These included:
1. administrative band lists, prepared by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, for the Greater Leech Lake, White Earth, Nett Lake, Fond du Lac, Mille Lacs, and Grand Portage Reservations;
2. medical histories and records maintained in the Medical Records Unit of the Cass Lake Indian Hospital;
3. copies of birth and death certificates, recorded for the Minnesota Department of Health;
4. responses to an informal, oral, recall questionnaire elicited from selected informants..
The following data were recorded, from one or more of the data sources, for the record of each index case:
1. name, including surname, married and given names; sex; birthdate;
2. birthplace and the residence at the time of sampling;
3. name, for each of the biological mother, father, and all siblings; dates of birth; alive or deceased; if alive, the residence at the time of sampling; the age or date and residence at time of death for decedents;
4. marital status, including unmarried,

married, widowed or divorced and/or combinations thereof; 5. treaty band affiliation and fraction Indian ancestry; 6. if married, widowed or divorced, the name(s) and the birthdate(s) or age(s) of the spouse(s); 7. if widowed, the age and residence of the spouse(s) at death; 8. if married or divorced, the residence of the spouse (s) at the time of sampling; 9. all progeny by name, birthdate, sex, biological or adopted, alive or deceased, including miscarriage and stillbirth; age and place of death for decedents, residence for living.
Genealogical reconstruction of consanguineal extended families was effected by consideration of each individual within the record of a primary index case as a secondary case, those within secondary records as tertiary cases, etc. Affinal relatives were utilized as points of entry into other extended families.
All lineages were investigated to information extinction in both the identification of index cases and the compilation of individual records. Extinction occurred when we observed:
1. non-Indian admixture (information on non-Indian relatives was, without exception, meagre);
2. emigration (collateral and affinal relatives were recalled with difficulty by our informants and records often lacked desired precision or time depth);
3. age (some index cases predate most demographic records and heavy reliance on informant recall).
Individual records were linked through common biological founders into biological sibships, extended families, and lineages. Thereafter, the following conversions and

Vol. 20, No. 4

additions were made to the individual records:
1. surnames were converted to a fourdigit code;
2. given names were converted to a fivedigit identification number assigned in order of decreasing age in the total population, i.e., oldest individuals received the lowest numbers and youngest individuals, the highest;
3. sequential sibship codes were added to each record in accordance with the method of Maclean (1969);
4. two-digit, numeric treaty-band numbers were assigned through a patrilineal principle;
5. fraction Indian ancestry was converted to a scale ranging from 0/8 Indian, for a non-Indian parent of an Indian child, through 8/8 Indian.
Band affiliation and ancestry were checked directly against the genealogies for concordance in assignment. We assumed only that the founder designations for affiliation and ancestry constituted baselines from which systematic assignment could follow. When we were unable to "establish" paternity, the maternal band affiliation was assigned. Such individuals were assigned the designation "ancestry-unknown."
Residence patterns and distributions were reevaluated in the terminal stages of data collection (December, 1968). Frequently, the residence of the index cases had changed, either within or to outside of the sampling area. Often, individuals had two or more geographic areas of seasonal or otherwise typical habitation. "Usual" residence was therefore defined as that in which an individual spent the majority of his or her time on an annual basis. In most cases, the usual residence was occupied for more than 50% of the year. For transient

individuals, the duration of usual residence was often less than 25% of the year.
Demographic records at our disposal indicated residence for each individual in a "major" village population center, rather than the actual village of residence. Informants, on the other hand, were requested to be specific in the assignment of usual residence to index cases. Persistent reevaluation of residence patterns resulted in equations of residential equivalence. Such residential equivalents were defined as aggregates of villages, any of which constituted an appropriate response to the question of usual residence. These are, typically, geographic clusters which grade into one another in settlement pattern.
A third-order residential classification, based upon band-equivalent regions, has been useful in preliminary organization and data analysis. The Greater Leech Lake Reservation is an amalgamation of three reservations. These were initially allotted to the Cass-Winnibigoshish, Leech Lake Pillager, and White Oak Point treaty bands. Prior to treaty in 1855, each treaty band consisted of one or more "bands" which ranged within and outside of the allotted territory. Contemporary villages can be equated through presence within one of the three band-equivalent geographic regions.
Two problems have arisen with this classification. First, the villages of Cass Lake and Bena occupy positions "within" the three regions. Cass Lake occupies this position through historic developments as an economic and administrative center, while for Bena the position is geographic. Accordingly, these two villages have been considered a fourth region, B. Second, the region of Inger-Bowstring Lake is on the border of the territories of the Cass-Winnibigoshish and White Oak Point bands. This has been resolved by treating the community within either or both of the regions in analysis.

We have found it useful to distinguish "online" and peripheral reservation communities. U.S. Highway #2 bisects the reservation, passing through, from west to east, Cass Lake, Bena, Ball Club, and Deer River. These "online" communities correspond, broadly, to the modern communities described on the Papago Reservation by Hackenberg (1972). Peripheral communities occur within the remainder of bandequivalent regions I--III.

THE OJIBWA POPULATION
Primary index cases include 518 individuals, 227 males and 291 females. The sex and age composition of the index sample, by ten-year intervals, is presented in Table 1. This distribution is consistent

with expectation when a health facility or program is used as sampling locale. Females frequently accompany the young and elderly to clinics, etc., in addition to requiring prenatal care and confinement with childbirth. Therefore, they present more frequent opportunities for sampling than do males. The excess of females (sex ratio of 78 relative to population estimate of 101) is thus not remarkable. Age variation in the sample is consistent with the sampling method employed.

Linkage of genealogical data resulted in the construction of family units. The agesex composition of the resident and emigrant subpopulations was derived through enumeration of each individual therein, by year of birth, sex, alive or deceased, and usual residence.
A total of 6,191 individuals of Indian ancestry, ranging from 8/8 to less than 1/8, were enumerated. Among these, 4,316 were alive in 1968. Living Ojibwa included 6S1 emigrants (296 male and 355 female, sex ratio around 83). Records and informants were concordant with the designation of these individuals as "probable" permanent emigrants. Seasonal emigrants, with usual residence within the sampling area, have been eumerated with the resident population. The population of "resident" Indians included 3,665 individuals.
The "best" census estimate of the resident population on January 1, 1968 included 4,724 individuals (Thistle et al., 1971). Comparison of that population with our sample is presented in Table 2. The sample size suggests 77% enumeration of the population. However, several contrasts between the census and sample are noteworthy. Our sample overenumerates males between the ages of 30-39 and females in each of the ten-year increments between the ages of 30-59. If we assume that the female excess has also contributed offspring to the 0-9 sample age-cohort, it follows that numerous compositional differences must emerge from comparisons of the census and sample populations.
The discrepancies between the two estimates of the population have resulted as a consequence of the dissimilar criteria utilized in the definition of sampling units. U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs and Division of Indian Health estimates are based upon the population to be serviced within and contiguous to the reservation, are economic cally motivated, and restrictive in defini-

of homogeneity for band affiliation resulted from pronounced inversion of the sex ratio of the immigrant class relative to that of the resident bands and unknown class (50:87).
Ancestry, residence, and band affiliation were cross-tabulated and tested with chisqiiare for independence. Each of the three cross-tabulations resulted in significant values of chi-square.4
Direction and intensity of associations between band affiliation and residence and band affiliation and ancestry were investigated by correlation analysis. Dichotomized distributions were established through assignment of a score of (1) for within class and (0) for not within class to each index case. Each band was analyzed for correlation with each band-equivalent region. In the inclusive analysis of a specific region, the communities of region B were scored (1), i.e., were included within the region.

Ancestry of 5/8 to 8/8 Indian (1), relative to 1/8 to 4/8 (0), was investigated by peripheral (1) and online (0) communities and by band-equivalent regions.
Correlation analysis, following Li (1961) was performed on each of the dichotomousbivariate tables. The results are presented in Table 3. Significant positive correlations for residence within congruent bandequivalent regions were observed. Exclusion of region B resulted in an increase in correlation of band affiliation and residence for the Cass-Winnibigoshish and White Oak Point bands. This observation supports the hypothesis that region B communities have drawn residents from each

of the band-equivalent regions.

III, were positive, significant, and equivalent. Subsequent to analysis, we found that a satellite community of Leech Lake Pillager affinity had universally claimed residence in Cass Lake. This effected a reduction in the correlation coefficient for residence in region III when the B-group communities were removed. The coefficient for region III plus B was not so affected. We conclude that distinction of region B from regions I--III will provide a basis for meaningful comparisons in future analyses.
Immigrants to the area exhibited a positive correlation with region B, i.e., the communities of Cass Lake and Bena, relative to the total nonimmigrant population. Internal analysis of the immigrant class indicated that Red Lake immigrants were negatively correlated with region B. Correlation of Red Lake immigrants was positive with each of regions I and II and negative with region III; Genealogies from Inger-Bowstring Lake indicated that Red Lake immigrants to that community were spouses of Cass-Winnibigoshish band members. The correlation of Red Lake with region II is inflated by inclusion of the community in analysis and is a function of the strong correlation, through marriage, with region I.
Immigrants other than those from Red Lake are positively correlated with region B. Those not resident in region B, exhibit strong positive correlation with region III and negative correlation with regions I and II. The majority (84%) of non-Red immigrants have migrated from the White Earth Reservation. Among these, members of the Otter Tail Pillager band (39%) have predominated. Consideration of band composition, size, and sex ratio for the White Earth Reservation in 1900 has suggested that Otter Tail band affiliants are the least probable immigrants to Leech Lake Reservation (Rokala, 1971). Hickerson (1962) has documented this band as

an early fission population from the Leech Lake Pillager. Their predominance at Leech Lake may represent an attraction through persistent ties of kinship with the Leech Lake Pillager of region III.
Significant positive correlations of ancestry greater than one-half Indian have been derived for the aggregate of regions I-III, i.e., peripheral reservation communities. Significant, negative correlation has been observed with "online" communities. These results suggest greater concentration of admixture in the "online" region, with relatively less in the peripheral communities.
CONCLUSIONS
Two processes, migration and admixture, are significant determinants of the demographic structure of the Leech Lake Reservation. Their associations with kinship and effects upon kinship and consanguinity in reservation communities are currently under investigation.
Migration can be reduced to three principal components: (1) internal reorganization; (2) immigration of non-Leech Lake Ojibwa to the reservation; and (3) emigration.
Internal reorganization exhibits three patterns: (1) random migration within restricted neighborhoods which correspond, approximately, to band-equivalent regions; (2) systematic migration from bandequivalent regions to "online" communities; and (3) infrequent migration from "online" communities to the periphery of regions I-III. Indian migration to the reservation is nonrandom by residence and by origin. Immigrants from the Red Lake Reservation reside within band-equivalent regions I and II. Other Indian immigrants reside in regions III and the online communities of Cass Lake and Bena. Work in progress suggests that emigration from

436

Rokala and Polcsky

the reservation occurs primarily from the "online" communities.
The net effect of migration on the reservation communities include a damping of population growth in the peripheral communities. Mortality in these communities remains a potent force in determining the demographic structure. In the absence of significant immigration, the peripheral communities may undergo negative growth. The direct effects of emigration and the indirect effects on natural increase will accentuate the rate of population aging and decline in size.
Emigrants from regions I and II may be effectively replaced by immigrants from the Red Lake Reservation, and region III may be stabilized by White Earth immigrants. However, it is probable that replacement will not occur and that the rate of decline in population size and the process of population aging will only be slowed. Indian immigrants from off-reservation and from peripheral reservation communities should produce an increase in the size of the online communities. However, the rate of increase will also be affected by the rate of emigration from the online population to off-reservation residences and by the age distribution of the emigrants. At the present time, it is probable that a negative net migration rate, with emigrants concentrated in the reproductive age groups, is producing negative population growth in the online communities.
Indian ancestry is greater among the populations of the peripheral communities of regions I-III. Online communities exhibit proportionately less Indian ancestry. The relative proportions of ancestry in all regions are affected by migration. We suggest that admixture with non-Indians occurs, primarily, in the online communities. That which occurs within the periphery, through marriage, results in migration to

the online communities. Admixture in online communities is associated with the open structure of the reservation and the non-Indian concentration therein. Emigration from the reservation occurs from the online communities and is associated with lesser Indian ancestry and/or marriage to non-Indians. The result of systematic emigration, associated with ancestry, should be to raise the proportion of Indian ancestry in the online, as well as the peripheral communities. Conversely, the urban population of emigrants from Leech Lake should exhibit relatively greater degrees of admixture.
The Greater Leech Lake Reservation exhibits structural features and patterns of admixture similar to those reported for the Nez Perce Reservation (Walker, 1967). Superficial similarities to the Papago Reservation and population (Hackenberg, 1972; Hackenberg and Wilson, 1972) are evident in the patterns of migration. Major differences may be expected to result from the, respectively, open and closed reservation systems. Workman and Niswander (1970) have reported internal genetic differentiation of the Papago Reservation communities. The Leech Lake patterns of differential immigration, emigration, and admixture may result in further understanding of the processes by which open and closed reservation systems effect internal genetic differentiation of reservation populations.
