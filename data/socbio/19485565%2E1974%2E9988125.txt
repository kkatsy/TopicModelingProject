Observations on "Heterogeneity of Childless Families," by Waller, Rao, and Li
S. Mitra
Emory University Atlanta, Georgia

The distribution of completed families by number of children born has been graduated by a negative binomial by Waller, Rao, and Li in their paper "Heterogeneity of Childless Families" (Social Biology, Vol. 20 [1973], No. 2, pp. 133-138). The authors have found that the model underestimates the proportion of childless families and have come up with the explanation that the model excludes those who remain childless because of sterility or deliberate avoidance of parenthood. And, accordingly, taking the validity of the model for granted, they have converted this discrepancy into an estimate of such families.
It seems that the model, as formulated, has serious shortcomings, despite its goodness of fit for the remainder of the distribution.
First, like childless families there must also be unknown proportions of families at every size that would either become subfecund or infertile at that point or deliberately try to prevent further childbirth.
Second, the logic that for a birth rate A,

and a population of size k, the probability of one birth in the next time interval is kl, which is the basis for the development of the model, can hardly be extended to the case of a couple. This is because the birth of a child cannot affect the probability of the next birth in the manner inherent in the model.
Third, the parameter r of this model, which is the initial population, and hence should have a value of 2 is estimated as 2.77 by the model of best fit (is there any other explanation of this parameter?), and this difference, without any statistical testing, appears to be large. Further, while a nonintegral estimate of r is acceptable, there is apparently no justification for the claim that it be a positive quantity and not necessarily an integer.
Fourth, their selection of the data may have been unfortunate, but without valid justifications they have forced a bellshaped curve on a distribution that is seemingly nonincreasing and hence J-shaped,
