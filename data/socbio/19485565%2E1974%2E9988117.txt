In recent years, a large number of studies have been carried out on muscular dystrophy, particularly on early diagnosis and on detection of genetic carriers (for example, see Smith et al., 1966; Walton et al., 1967; Thompson et al., 1967). However, there have been surprisingly few epidemiological studies.
Data concerning prevalence rates of different types of myopathies in human populations were reported in Britain (Walton and Nattras, 1954), in two regions of the United States (Herndon, 1954; Kurland, 1958), and in Japan (Kuroiwa and Miyazaki, 1967). However, none of these studies gives the precise geographical distribution of the different types of muscular dystrophy, although this information might prove useful in evaluating the effects of environment on their prevalence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The reported cases were obtained from a general survey of hospital records over a twelve-year period in the following regions of Italy: Véneto, Trentino-Alto Adige, and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The area considered is the northeastern part of Italy, of which the natural borders are the Alps in the north, the Adriatic Sea in the

east, Garda Lake in the west, and the Po River in the south. We have assumed that practically all the patients afflicted with one of these disabling diseases would have received hospital attention at least once in their lifetimes.
The total number of hospital records examined was about 250,000. The original diagnoses were reviewed, and all dubious cases as well as records with insufficient clinical information were discarded. To exclude possible interference due to the contribution of non-native individuals, patients with nonregional surnames were not included in the study.
Each case was recorded separately in a statistic file; clinical findings as well as personal and family data were recorded. The pedigree of familiar cases was traced.
Our interest was concentrated on five different types of myopathy, the genetics of which are clearly defined; X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy (Duchenne), autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy (Duchenne-like), autosomal recessive limbgirdle muscular dystrophy, autosomal dominant facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy, and autosomal dominant dystrophia myotonica. For the classification of types of progressive muscular dystrophy, the cri-

RESULTS

Medwin (1968) were followed. According to these criteria, X-linked muscular dystrophy includes both the severe Duchenne type and the clinically milder Becker type (Becker and Keiner, 19SS; Becker, 1957, 1962). The autosomal recessive type (Duchenne-like) was separated because of its different pattern of inheritance (Kloepfer and Talley, 1958).
The prevalence rate for each type of muscular dystrophy was calculated as the number of cases found in the survey period (12 years) over the total population of the area. A similar method was used by Kuroiwa and Miyazaki (1967) for estimating the prevalence rate of Fukuoka City, Japan.
The statistical data referring to the

The overall prevalence of myopathies is slightly higher than that obtained in previous surveys (Table 1); the relative proportion of cases shows that 46 per cent of the cases are X-linked Duchenne, while 35 per cent are autosomal recessive limbgirdle. On the basis of the pedigree analysis, familiar cases of Duchenne muscular dystrophy account for about 25 per cent of the total.
There are differences in the prevalence of different types of muscular dystrophy in different districts and regions as well as differences in the relative proportion of cases (Table 2 and Figure 1). I t is possible that some of these differences are due to one or more large families in an area hav-

myotonic dystrophy cases in the neighborhood of Padova and Udine.
Additionally, small differences between districts could be explained on the basis of a multigenerational drift, but this is not the case for differences between regions. In fact, there is a significant difference in the prevalence rate for the limb-girdle type between Véneto (1.70X 10-") and Friuli-Venezia Giulia (2.81 X10-5).
It is possible to differentiate three main areas on the basis of the prevalence rates of different myopathies. In one of them (Verona, Padova, and Venezia districts),

Duchenne type is prevalent; in another (Bolzano, Belluno, Trento, Pordenone, Udine, and Trieste districts), limb-girdle type is more frequent; in a third area, limited to the district of Rovigo, the facioscapulo-humeral type accounts for a very large number of cases.
In addition, the distribution of cases over the surveyed area seems to correlate with the geographic characteristics of the territory, the limb-girdle type being much more frequent in northern and mountain districts.

the two more frequent forms (Duchenne and limb-girdle). When the data are grouped following the scheme of districts belonging to the same administrative unit, the chi-square value is at the border of significance. However, when the data are grouped according to the geographic characteristic of the districts, the differences become much more significant (P = 0.05 -- 0.02).
DISCUSSION
The results obtained in this survey indicate: (a) a rather high prevalence of muscular dystrophy and, in particular, Duchenne cases; (b) a nonhomogeneous distribution of cases, with a higher prevalence of limb-girdle cases in mountain districts. The reliability of the data is supported both by the large number of cases (366) and by the total prevalence value (5.42 for 100,000 inhabitants), comparable with data in the literature.
The rather high prevalence observed for Duchenne cases has received an indirect support from the findings of Lawrence et al. (1973) among Italian immigrants in

Australia. The muscular dystrophy incidence among Italians appears to be higher than among other ethnic groups,
As for the geographic distribution, an analysis must take into account different factors--ethnic, historical, geographical, or socioeconomic--which could play a role in establishing and maintaining differential gene distributions in the regions surveyed.
ETHNOLOGICAL FACTORS
T n e n a t i v e population of the area considered in our survey is not homogeneous from the anthropological point of view, The early existence of three main groups (Northerners, Mediterraneans, and Adriatics) is well known. Cultural and linguistic differences between different districts still persist, but these different "cultures" do not overlap exactly with the original groups mentioned above.
HISTORICAL FACTORS
The original populations received genetic contributions by invasions and immigrations of northern and northeastern populations in the centuries before the rise of

240

the Republic of Venice (fourteenth century). From 1797-1860, another small immigration took place during the Austrian occupation of the region. However, it is relevant to point out that apart from this immigration in the last century, the population has not undergone relevant genetic changes.
GEOGRAPHICAL FACTORS
The three regions considered in the survey are subdivided into 13 districts. Four of them are mostly mountainous districts, and five are partially hilly. All nine were rather isolated in the past by the lack of good roads. The remaining four plain districts are crossed by several important rivers which in the past constituted strong natural barriers. This situation was probably responsible, at least in part, for the isolation of several "genetic islands" in the area.
SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS
For centuries, the economy of the region was based mainly upon agriculture. The level of urbanization is still rather low. The distribution of town sizes shows a maximum of towns with one- to five-hundred inhabitants.
Until now, the area has been unable to attract immigrants from other regions. The available data on internal migration shows also that the internal mobility of the population is relatively low. Regarding choice of marriage partner, the statistical data available indicate that 92 per cent of people in Friuli-Venezia Giulia married people from the same region. A strong family organization contributes to the transmission and preservation of traditional customs, particularly in the choice of a marriage partner. We believe that all of these factors have contributed to the formation and consequent stabilization of several micro-

populations, characterized by a rather high level of endogamy.
A preliminary study of ABO blood group distribution, made on a random sample of 8,657 blood donors in the district of Vicenza, showed the existence of at least two definite genetic islands, each homogeneous within itself, but with strong heterogeneity between them with regard to the A / 0 ratio.
The differences in the prevalence of particular types of muscular dystrophy and the differences in the proportions of the various types in different districts indicate that three geographic areas can be identified. In northern districts, the limb-girdle type shows a very high level of morbidity. In the south-central districts of Padova, Vicenza, and Verona, the Duchenne type is clearly predominant. In the most southern district, there is a very high prevalence of facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy.
As a whole, this distribution suggests the coexistence of at least two different populations in the same area. However, no data have been reported on differential distribution of alíeles for muscular dystrophy among other human populations; on the contrary, in spite of various ethnic differences, the incidence of muscular dystrophy in Japanese populations was found to be similar to the Western one.
We think that the high rate of prevalence for limb-girdle type (autosomal recessive) found in the mountain districts could be explained at least in part by endogamy in small populations, considering that in poor districts, far from main roads, the probability of nonrandom mating is higher and leads progressively to the formation of inbred populations. On the other hand, it must be remembered that in this area the prevalence of the Duchenne type (X-linked recessive) is rather low.
It is conceivable that the mountain en-
