Secondary analyses of census materials are important in many facets of research in the social sciences. In a number of cases, the data presented are based on a sample from the total census of as few as 1 in 1,000 cases (Mitra, 1966a, 1966Ô, 1966c, 1966d). These samples are assumed to be reliable, and considerable confidence is placed in the acceptability of such data for the valid description and interpretation of social phenomenon. The purpose of the present research is to test the adequacy of the 1 in 1,000 sample by comparing data based on it with similar

data based on a sample which is proportionately much larger.
Mitra (1966a) is concerned with the childbearing patterns of American women. Part of the presentation includes data on the incidence of childlessness among American women, based on a 1 in 1,000 sample of the 1960 United States census. In order to test the extent to which data based on a small sample can be used interchangeably with data based on larged samples, parts of Mitra's analysis were reformulated, based on a sample fifty times larger. As shown in Table 1, when

a sample of 50 in 1,000 is used some discrepancies can be observed.
When the sampling base is very large, as it is for white wives over the age of 20, virtually no discrepancies are found. However, when the sampling base is approximately one-tenth as large, as it is for nonwhites compared with whites, the variation in percentages is consistently larger. When the population to be sampled is still smaller, as it is for wives under the age of 20, the variation is quite substantial. In comparing childlessness among young wives, a sample of 1 in 1,000 would indicate only IS percentage points difference between whites and nonwhites; a sample of 50 in 1,000 would indicate 21.5 percentage points difference, a variation of over 6%.
How much importance can be attached to variability in percentages? It is suggested that the significance of discrepancies between percentages is only partly attributable to the absolute magnitude of those differences. In some cases, even a small variation may have a considerable influence on the nature of interpretations which may be offered. For example, consider the data in Table 2, which includes the variable of duration of marriage1, and
1 Mitra's categories for duration of marriage are difficult to interpret, in that they are given as

which is thus relevant to an even smaller population base. For nonwhite women married 5-9 years, the variation in the incidence of childlessness based on small and large samples is only 5 percentage points. However, this difference is the difference between the remarkably low estimate of maximum sterility of only3.3%, an incidence which is comparable with the lowest rates reported anywhere in the literature, and an estimate of 8.3% which, although also low, is not unusual.
Furthermore, small absolute differences in percentages may make significant substantive differences in the kinds of generalizations which are offered. Thus, on the basis of a 1 in 1,000 sample, one might conclude that: "Among women married 5 to 9 years aged 25"--39, childlessness among whites is from 6 to 10 percentage points lower than childlessness among nonwhites. Among women either very young (20-24) or very old (40-44), the relationship is reversed, with childlessness being slightly higher among whites." However, on the basis of a 50 in 1,000 sample, one could justifiably conclude: "Among
follows: -2 years, 2-5 years, 5-10 years, 10-15 years, 15-20 years, and 20+ years (Mitra, 1966a, p. 135). In what grouping does one place women who have been married exactly 5 years or exactly 10 years? Private communication with Mitra (June 9, 1971) confirmed our interpretation that 5-10 years means in fact 5-9 years inclusive.

women married S to 9 years, childlessness is consistently lower among whites than among nonwhites, with greater discrepancies being found in the older age groups."
The use of the 1 in 1,000 sample for the analysis of census data is undoubtedly a legitimate and valid procedure for many research designs. The purpose of the reanalysis of Mitra's data is not simply to reaffirm again the principle that large and adequate samples are to be preferred to small and inadequate ones. Rather, it is

to illustrate the limitations of these samples for some specific kinds of analysis and to reiterate again the need for caution in the interpretation of data based on the 1 in 1,000 sample, especially when the base population to be sampled is relatively small and the absolute differences among percentage points are not large.
