ABSTRACT: A comparison of women's and men's performance in swimming, running, and skating is made based on available world record data. The ratio of women's to men's record times is analyzed as a time series, and the asymptotic value of this ratio is discussed in the context of a model. "Rate of improvement curves" are defined over time and by event in a given sport and are compared across gender. The relationship of record time to event distance is estimated and also analyzed across event and gender boundaries. We make three conclusions: 1. The rate of improvement for women has been extraordinary and is larger for longer distance vents. 2. Lawlike relations emerge for record times and event lengths. These relations have interesting physical interpretations when examined for various sports. 3. The male physiology is more suited to anaerobic strength events while, given increased access and participation, women can be expected to be more on a par with men in some long-distance aerobic events.

As a social phenomenon, organized competitive sports centered on competition between male athletes until the last half of this century. The increased number of events in which both men and women participate allows for a comparative analysis across gender boundaries, which is the subject of this research. We examine the relative performance of men and women in events of varying distance for swimming, running, and speed skating, and relate the results to the underlying physiology of the human body.
Many researchers have studied the athletic performance of men; considerably fewer have studied women. This statement also holds true for studies in comparative physiology (see Keller, 1974, Ryder et al., 1976, Glick, 1978, Mognoni et al., 1982, and Chätterjee

and Chätterjee, 1982, for mathematical and statistical studies of men's performance). Hill (1925), McMahon (1984), and Alexander (1988, 1992) give useful background on sports physiology and the mechanics of locomotion. Broad studies in comparative physiology and the political and social implications of gender differences are found in Dyer (1982), Hubbard (1990), and Wells (1991). One basic fact that emerges from the latter studies is that women have less muscle mass (and overall smaller skeletons) than men. These differences are due both to physiology and to the fact that muscle development and athletic training among women is not strongly reinforced as a desirable social and aesthetic value. Social factors are treated by Bleir (1984) as "part of the research design

rather than as noise to be filtered out." Our performance data span a time period where men's participation is relatively stable andwomen's participation is initially sparse but then increases in the recent past. This design bias, which influences the availability and constrains the interpretation of performance data, is discussed where appropriate.
Our data come from two main sources, The World Almanac and The Guinness Book of World Records. Since women's participation has been uneven, we lack data before 1970 for swimming and skating. The situation is somewhat better for running, where we have performance results for at least fifty years for all events. This lack of data is the primary example of the design bias mentioned earlier, and thus we have been duly cautious in drawing conclusions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ANALYSIS OF SPORT PERFORMANCE

For each event studied, the world record data form a time series, where for each year a data point T,exists (the record time during that year). Since records are not set every year, wefill in the intervening years with the most recent record, so that the series decreases monotonically. Several models are described that are used to fit various aspects of these series.
We begin with an exponential model (Chatterjee and Chatterjee, 1982):

7f =a + ße-*

(1)

where Tft is the record time for the ith event in the fth year for gender G, and

a, ß, and y are constants. Here a isthe ultimate future performance time, y is the decay rate, and ß is the base value above a from which the value decays. For each event, we have data for n years, so that t = 1,2,..., n. Since our interest is in comparing men and women, we actually model the ratio of women's to men's times:

Rn^Tjf/Tf?

(2)

The parameters a, ß, and y retain their original meanings under this transformation.
Another important aspect of the data is the compound rate rit at which the data values for event i decrease over its observed history. This "rate of improvement" r¡ is estimated as the slope of log(/?,-() with /, for f = 1,2,..., n. We construct rate of improvement curves (RIC) that graph the relationship of r¡with distance D¡ of the ith event in each of three sports. Therelative rates of improvement for women and men are then examined.
Finally, we study the relationship between current and world record times and the distance of the events across sports. This cross-sectional analysis gives us a measure for the effect of the medium (water, air, ice) in which the events of equal distance take place. Our model is a simple linear regression:

E(TG) =aG + bG D¡ (3)
where E is the expected value of TG, the current world records for gender G in the ith event. Within the observed range of the data for swimming, running, and skating, the linear fit is more than adequate. .

the parameters (where estimable) vary, two features emerge. The ratio of women's to men's time for each event has decreased over time, and most events show no sign of stability, as evidenced by the lack of estimable asymptotes.
The estimates used for constructing the rate of improvement curves are given in Table 2. In Figure 2, we plot the rates of improvement against event distance for swimming, running, and skating. With the exception of skating, which shows uneven behavior, the rate of improvement increases for men and women with increasing event distance. The rate of improvement is consistently higher for women than for men at all distances. Finally, for all events, women's RIC is slightly steeper than the men's curve.

CROSS-SECTIONAL RESULTS
Table 3 and Figure 3 examine the current women's and men's world record times for all swimming, running, and skating events against event distance. The figure plot is formed by joining successive points with a piecewise line segment. It is noteworthy that the points fall virtually on six straight lines, grouped in pairs for each of the three sports, having different slopes (measured in seconds per meter) and intercepts. This finding strongly illustrates the effect that the medium in which an event takes place has on the velocity with which races are run. The figure suggests an almost law-like relationship between the expected recordbreaking times and the distances for a given year. In swimming, for example,

'The regression estimates of current world record times against various distances for free style swimming, running (excluding the marathon events), and skating events are given along with their estimated standard errors (in parentheses).

records. Women's slope is greater than men's in 1981 by about 0.0360, which is to be compared to a difference of 0.0433 for the current world record data.
A useful exercise is to use the estimated slopes of the regression lines to predict the time for an ultra long distance event. The calculations and other details are given in Table 4 using the marathon as an example.
From the above analysis, it appears that for a marathon event, the predicted average velocities of 0.1832 m/s (men) and 0.1642 m/s (women) may not be attained in the near future. The historical yearly average velocity increase for the Boston marathon, for example, are 0.33% (men) and 1.92% (women), considerably below those expected from the regression results. Based on short distances alone, we cannot accurately predict the results for extreme long distance events.

for an increase of one meter in distance, the current expected times for men and women will increase by 0.5963 and 0.6396 respectively. For all three sports, we note that the women's slope is greater than the men's.
We have also examined a limited number of cases to determine how these cross-sectional relationships between record times and distance of events hold up over time. These cases suggest that the relationship is sound at any arbitrary point in an event's history. For example, the regression results for 1981 swimming are given by:
= H.7762 + 0.6036D,
E (7ffii981) = 10.0710 + 0.6396D
The estimated relationships are similar to those observed for the current world

DISCUSSION
We have seen in the previous section the details of the data analysis. Here we examine possible causes for these results. In this section, results of our time series and cross-sectional analysis are consolidated and related to the underlying physiology of the human body and to the social contexts in which competitive sports take place. Many of the results are a direct consequence of the historical exclusion of women from athletic competition and the related lack of training opportunities for those women who do participate. In the recent past, this situation has been somewhat remedied, but the data still show the effects of the bias.

"Since marathon times are socourse-dependent, averages of the best marathon times for Boston andN.Y. are used to calculate deviation from the prediction.

For short distance locomotion, the ratio of women's to men's time is greater than 1.10, closer to 1 for long distances, with the greatest gains being made in swimming, skating, and running, respectively. The increased buoyancy due to women's overall higher fat content likely offsets their smaller muscle mass and thus reduces the ratio in swimming. The difference

in absolute times for allsports issmallest for shorter distances and increases with longer distance.
The rate of improvement curves for women are consistently higher than those of men for all distances in swimming and running. This reflects the fact that women have entered only recently into most of the events studied. The early history of an event is marked

both by rapid improvement in performance times and by large fluctuations in the coefficient of variation of the times (Chatterjee and Laudato, 1994). As events mature (through broader participation and increased knowledge of training and event strategy) the improvement and variation both decrease. Women's events currently exhibit behavior seen in men's events in the past.
The record times follow an almost law-like linear relation with distance, the relationship being reasonably constant over the years. The men's slopes (s/m) are smaller than women's and are medium dependent, with the largest slopes for swimming, followed by skating and running. Since the estimates from which the slopes were determined are heavily weighted by short distance events, these numbers simply reflect men's superiority in short distance (anaerobic) events only. This superiority is mostly due to the larger muscle mass that men possess, but as with the ratios we note that women approach men closely in the swimming events where muscle mass is offset by buoyancy. We have no data to test whether the relationship holds at intermediate distances (between 10,000 meters and the marathon), though the marathon results discussed in Section II.3 lead us to believe that the linearity may disappear as event distance increases.
For most events, optimal levels of performance have not been reached; this is particularly true of women for aerobic distances. Consequently the asymptote (the ultimate ratio) is not estimable for most events, though such an estimate for many men's events may be obtained for the absolute time for an individual event. This is again a

consequence of the smaller pool of participants in women's events and the relatively short history of the competitions.
Finally, we have studied elsewhere (Chatterjee and Laudato, 1994) the distribution of the arrival of new records. The average number of records per year is greater for long distance events and is higher for women than for men at all distances. There are several possible factors that influence these results. Short distance events represent the ultimate velocity attainable for humans and thus barring significant advances in training techniques, it is relatively rare that a runner will surpass current times. Women set more records partly because the pool of participants is increasing in size and event specialization. As their participation levels stabilize, the record distribution should become similar to men's.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
The performance data studied here is influenced by the size of the participant pools, the length of time an event has existed and the gender of the competitors. Men exceed women in absolute time, but women show greater improvement across events. This fact is related to the time history of the events. The absolute time results stem primarily from physiological differences between women and men, but also because of the preponderance throughout most of this century of male-only sporting events. Because women's events are not yet mature, the pool of women athletes is smaller. Society still places greater value on

professional men's sports and hence fewer fiscal and training resources are allocated to the improvement of women's competition. Pure athletics is the primary arena wherein these values are shifting, as evident in the greater rate of improvement for women.
There are many sports that we have not analyzed and several other factors we have not considered in the analyses we do perform. The frequency of records, for example, is determined partly by economic considerations. Setting a record involves greater physical stress on the athlete than just running a good race and winning without producing a new record. Since athletes earn money (through prizes and endorsements) based on winning races, it is in their interest to increase the number of years they are viable competitors by minimizing the strain on their bodies (Ryder et al., 1976). Of the

events we have not studied, ultra long distance swimming and walking are two where women have exceeded men in some cases. The current holder of the English Channel swim is a woman, as is the record holder of longest minimally interrupted distance walked. If such events were internationally recognized and sponsored, it is possible that women would be comparable in overall performance to men. While it is unreasonable to expect a women record holder for lifting free weights, such records in ultra long distance locomotion events are not only possible, but have occurred and will likely continue to occur.
