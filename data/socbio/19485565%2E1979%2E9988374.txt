Consequences of the Number and Spacing of Pregnancies on Outcome, and of Pregnancy Outcome on Spacing
Basil G. Zimmer
DepartmentofSociology Brown University Providence, Rhode Island
ABSTRACT:This study is based on 3,098 once-married women in Abderdeen, Scotland, who had a total of 10,825 pregnancies, which resulted in wastages of 285 infant deaths, 173 stillbirths, 712 involuntary abortions, and 200voluntary terminations. Wastage varies by pregnancy number, particularly after the third pregnancy. There is, however, a selective factor operating here in that women who have a wastage are more likely to continue on to the next higher pregnancy number, and those who have a wastage at one pregnancy number are more likely to have a wastage at the next pregnancy outcome also. Wastage tends to be cumulative. Women who enter the reproductive cycle at the younger ages have a larger number of pregnancies and a higher wastage rate than women who postpone their first pregnancy until the older ages. Women who experience a wastage at any given pregnancy number are not only more likely to have another pregnancy, but they do soover a shorter time interval than those whose last pregnancy resulted in a live birth. Except for terminations, wastage is highest among women who closely space their pregnancy.

mortality and fertility, Helen Ware (1977), citing van de Walle and Knodel (1967) notes that "Despite the pronouncements of classical transition theory, it is difficult to produce an example of a European country where a prior improvement in child survival was the major factor obliging parents to restrict their fertility within marriage."
The lack of a clear-cut understanding of this issue isto be expected since there are a large number of extraneous variables at the macro level that affect both infant mortality and fertility. The obvious problem here is that both infant mortality decline and fertility decline may be a function of economic development and broad societal changes. Both changes may be due to a common variable. As one author has observed, "Needless to say, such an oversimplified approach has contributed little to a better understanding of this complex relationship" (Friedlander, 1977, p. 183).
Preston (1975) has claimed that in order to test adequately the hypothesis that fertility is in fact affected by infant mortality the analysis has to be at the individual family level. Helen Ware (1977) also notes, "For the analysis of the causal relationship between child mortality and fertility it is necessary to turn to family studies," as opposed to aggregate studies based on crude demographic measures, which provide the most readily availablecross-national data (Oechsli and Kirk, 1975).
At the individual family level, it is usually hypothesized that infant mortality inflates fertility. But the opposite argument that high fertility inflates mortality is also found. Knodel (1968, p. 297), for example, states:
The possible influence of fertility on mortality, although occasionally acknowledged, israrely given serious consideration. Nevertheless, some evidence has been ac-

cumulated which suggests that fertility can have a substantial effect on infant mortality. More specifically, several studies have demonstrated that infants born after a relatively short interval experience considerably higher mortality than those born after longer intervals.
At the individual family level, the mortality-fertility link is most frequently stated in terms of the child replacement hypotheses (Friedlander, 1977; Ware, 1977; Scrimshaw, 1978). This specified that "parents will strive to replace dead children" (Ware, 1977) or that "when a child dies, it is hypothesized, a couple will attempt to 'replace' it as quickly as possible" (Scrimshaw, 1978, p. 384). Accordingly, child loss may lead to direct attempts to replace the lost child. Consequently, "declines in mortality should lead to a direct decline in fertility (assuming adequate fertility control mechanisms are accessible) because replacement births would not be necessary" (Singarimbun and Hull, 1977). Thus, according to this body of literature, high mortality is a stimulus to higher fertility. But there is quite a different dimension to the problem. In a recent article on the fertility-mortality equation, Scrimshaw (1978) notes that while the idea is seldom mentioned, mortality may sometimes be a response to high fertility instead of a stimulus to it. Several studies in a different cultural settings are cited by Scrimshaw which show that mortality does have a positive effect on fertility (Snyder, 1974; DaVanzo, 1972).
One of the most extensive attempts to study the replacement effect was that by Lery and Vallin (1975) for France. This study was based on a large sample of women born 1892-1916. This population was already practicing family planning extensively, thus satisfying the most important requirement for estimating the replacement effect. The authors demonstrated that parity progression ratios were higher

short intervals were subject to higher mortality than were infants born following longer intervals, providing the previous child was still living at the time of the following birth. The same author goes on to note that infant mortality is higher for births following infant deaths than for births following live births that survived. No doubt this is influenced by the shorter interval between events. At any rate, it is suggested that mortality risks among siblings are positively correlated.
Several other studies have also shown that the spacing interval greatly influenced postneonatal and infant deaths (Wyon and Gordon, 1971; Wolfers and Scrimshaw, 1975). These findings are particularly significant, because as Knodel notes "the fact that fertility can exercise a substantial influence on infant mortality has serious implications for the interpretation of correlations between the two variables. It is not justifiable to treat infant mortality purely as the independent variable."
It is quite clear from the limited evidence available that the mortality-fertility link is a complex issue. There is considerable evidence to support both propositions, i.e., that high fertility is a stimulus to high mortality and that high mortality is a stimulus to high fertility. Thus, further research in this area needs little justification.
The research literature on the mortality-fertility link has focused on four different dimensions: (1) How do child losses affect fertility? (2) How does fertility affect losses? (3) How do losses affect spacing to next birth? (4) How does the spacing of births affect losses? Most studies that have addressed these questions have been limited only to births and infant deaths. Thus, measures of attempts at replacement, as well as spacing, have been limited only to those that were successful in producing another birth. This is a serious shortcoming.
In this paper we suggest that if data

were available only for infant deaths and births much of the effort at reproduction, as well as efforts at "replacement" of losses, is excluded from the analysis. What is needed are complete pregnancy histories by outcome, since those who do experience an infant death or any other type of loss may attempt "replacement" but may do so unsuccessfully because of pregnancy wastage. In other words, to examine only additional births (including stillbirths), may grossly understate attempts at replacement and the spacing of events. "Replacement effects" and "spacing effects" are also to be seen in further attempts at reproduction when losses occur prior to full term. In short, attention should be focused on further attempts at reproduction related to the specific outcome of each pregnancy event. To do this, one needs complete pregnancy histories.
This paper focuses on three issues: (1) What is the relationship between pregnancy outcome and the proportion of women who go on to have another pregnancy? (2) How does the number and spacing of pregnancies affect outcome? (3) How does pregnancy outcome, in turn, influence the number and spacing of succeeding pregnancy events?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study is based on a random sample of 3,098 once-married women in Aberdeen, Scotland, who had a pregnancy outcome during the period 1950 to 1955.' Their reproductive behavior was followed through 1970. Thus, the sample represents a cross-section of families who experienced a pregnancy during a specified time period rather than a cross-section of

the urban community (Freedman and Coombs, 1966). Complete reproductive histories of a one-in-five random sample were obtained from the maternity hospital records in Aberdeen. This is a central record-keeping system which also includes all of the domiciliary deliveries in the community.2 At the end of the follow-up period, more than eight of ten of the women were forty years of age or over and thus had largely completed their reproduction. They had a total of 10,825 pregnancies, which resulted in 9,592 live births that survived the first year, 285 infant deaths, 173 stillbirths, 712 involuntary abortions, and 200 voluntary terminations. The number of outcomes exceed the number of pregnancies since some of the

outcomes (1.2 per cent) involved multiple products.
Before proceeding with the analysis, let us look at the general pregnancy experience of the total sample. The number and percentage of women who continued on to a given pregnancy number is shown in Table 1. Most of the women (93 per cent) continued to the second pregnancy, but after that the dropout rate was rapid. The number continuing to the third pregnancy declined to two-thirds, and only four out of ten continued on to their fourth pregnancy. After the sixth pregnancy, 94 per cent had reached the end of their reproductive cycle, and the proportion continued to decline steadily after each subsequent event. After the second pregnancy, four or five out of every ten women dropped out after each subsequent pregnancy. The followng discussion is limited only to the first six pregnancies because of the small size of the sample at the higher pregnancy numbers.

·Wastage includes infant deaths, involuntary abortions, stillbirths, and induced terminations (voluntary abortions).

WASTAGE BY PREGNANCY NUMBER
As is evident from Table 2, wastage rates vary directly by pregnancy number, particularly after the third pregnancy outcome. The proportion of pregnancies that resulted in a wastage ranges from 10 to 12 per cent for the first three pregnancies and increases to more than 20 per cent by the sixth pregnancy outcome. A selective factor operating here, however, is that the probability of continuing on to another pregnancy is much higher in the case of wastage than if the pregnancy resulted in a live birth that survived the first year. For the first four pregnancies, the differences are substantial. For example, all of the wives whose first pregnancy resulted in wastage continued on to the second pregnancy, whereas 8.2 per cent of those who had a live birth that lived did not do so. Of the women who went on to the second pregnancy and had a live birth that lived, only about two-thirds continued on to a third pregnancy, as compared to 96 per cent of those that experienced a wastage.

Similar differences are found for later pregnancy outcomes also. Women having a wastage at any given pregnancy number, at least through the first four pregnancies, are much more likely to go on to have another pregnancy than are those whose pregnancy resulted in a live birth that survived the first year of life, thus suggesting attempts at replacement. It is not until the fifth pregnancy that the proportion that goes on to have additional pregnancies is unrelated to the outcome of the previous event.
The data shown in Figure 1, as well as in Table 2, suggest that wastage is cumulative, that is, that the wastage rate is higher in the next pregnancy among those who had previously experienced a wastage in their last pregnancy. But regardless of the previous pregnancy outcome, the wastage rate increases directly by pregnancy number. These data suggest that repeated pregnancies increase the probability that the pregnancy will result in a wastage. The higher-order pregnancies thus contribute

a disproportionately high number to the overall pregnancy wastage rate in the population. This is due, in part, to the fact that women who experience wastage also tend disproportionately to go on to the higher pregnancy numbers (Omran and Standley, 1976).
When we examine the outcome of each pregnancy according to the previous pregnancy experiences, we find that there is a disproportionately high rate of wastage at any given pregnancy number among those who have experienced a wastage at an early pregnancy. As the number of pregnancies resulting in a wastage increases, the probability of having a wastage from the next pregnancy also increases.3 To illustrate, the wastage rates at the fourth pregnancy outcome, as shown in Figure 1, tend to vary by the number of previous pregnancies that resulted in a wastage. The order in which the previous wastages occurred is important. For women whose first pregnancy outcome was a live birth that lived, we find that if they did not have a wastage at either the second or third pregnancy, only 12.5 per cent experienced a wastage at the fourth pregnancy. But if these women had only one wastage at either the second or third pregnancy, the loss rate increased at the fourth pregnancy to 15.2 per cent if the previous wastage was at the second pregnancy, but to 15.9 per cent if it was at the third pregnancy outcome. Among women whose first pregnancy was a live birth that lived but whose second and third pregnancies resulted in wastages, the wastage rate at the fourth pregnancy was 22.9 per cent.
Even greater wastage occurs for women whose first pregnancy resulted in a wastage. If such women did not have a

wastage at either the second or third pregnancy, only 7 per cent had a wastage at the fourth pregnancy. However, if they had a wastage at the second pregnancy, in addition to the first, their loss rate increased to 17.2 per cent by the fourth pregnancy. It jumped to 38.5 per cent among those who had a loss at the third pregnancy, and to 47.1 per cent among those whose second and third pregnancies had both resulted in wastages. The latter is more than double the rate (22.9 per cent) noted for women whose first pregnancy outcome was a live birth that lived but whose next two pregnancies resulted in a wastage.
SPACING BY LAST PREGNANCY OUTCOME
We now turn to an examination of the relationship between pregnancy outcome and the spacing to the next pregnancy event, as well as the impact that spacing has on the next pregnancy outcome. The first part of the analysis is limited to the first four pregnancies because of the limited number of cases in the sample. The spacing interval is measured in terms of the time span between pregnancy outcomes. Obviously, this type of measure introduces a serious bias in favor of showing higher wastage among women with short intervals when looking at the impact that spacing has on outcome, because of the shorter intervals related to events that do not run full term. However, this measure would not bias the results when looking at the impact that pregnancy outcome has on the spacing interval to the next pregnancy outcome which is the issue of concern in the following discussion.
It is evident from the data shown in Figures 2 and 3 that the spacing to the next pregnancy varies substantially by the outcome of the previous event. Women at any given pregnancy number are less likely to have their next pregnancy closely spaced if they had a live birth that survived the first year than if they experienced a

wastage.4 Women most likely to have their next pregnancy outcome closely spaced are those whose last pregnancy resulted in an involuntary abortion. The differences in the distribution of spacing intervals to the next pregnancy outcome by last pregnancy outcome are substantial. To illustrate, less than 10 per cent of the women whose first pregnancy resulted in a live birth had the next pregnancy outcome with 14 months, as compared with nearly 20 per cent of those who had a live birth that died, more that 30 per cent of those who had a stillbirth, and nearly 40 per cent of those who had an involuntary abortion. It is noted further that while less than one-fourth of the women whose first pregnancy resulted in a live birth had their next pregnancy outcome within an interval of 15 to 24 months, approximately 40 per cent of those who had a wastage had their second pregnancy outcome within this time interval.
For the total sample, the average spacing interval between pregnancy outcomes
4 Unfortunately, no data are available on the lactation practices of the women in this sample. Such data would be valuable since this is the biological mechanism affecting spacing in relationship to child survival. It is noted, however, that this is an important intermediate variable in spacing which no doubt accounts for part of the longer spacing intervals found among women whose last pregnancy resulted in a live birth that survived the first year.

is summarized in Table 3. The average interval is slightly more than three years, but the length of the interval between pregnancy outcomes, at each pregnancy number, varies markedly by the outcome of the last pregnancy. The average spacing is much longer for women whose last pregnancy resulted in a live birth than it is for women who experienced a wastage of any type. Among the women whose last pregnancy resulted in wastage, it is those who experienced an involuntary abortion who have the shortest spacing interval to the next pregnancy outcome. Actually, they have the next pregnancy outcome in about half the time of those who had a live birth. The same general range of difference is found at each pregnancy number. These data demonstrate the need for taking into account the previous pregnancy outcome in our attempts to understand the "tempo" of reproductive behavior.
Women who experienced a pregnancy wastage of any type apparently attempted to make up for the loss by "trying again" after a very short interval of time. And, as noted earlier (Table 2), women were much more likely, at any given pregnancy number, to continue on to the next pregnancy if they had a wastage than if they had a live birth. Thus, not only are women more likely to have another pregnancy if they experience a wastage, but they have

it much sooner than do women who have a live birth.
Table 4 shows the percentage of women who have the next pregnancy outcome within selected time intervals by the outcome of the last pregnancy. Here again the evidence indicates that a much higher proportion of women who experience a wastage have the next pregnancy in the shortest time interval. At each pregnancy number, the size of the difference is marked as well as consistent. With few exceptions, only one-third of the women

who had a live birth had the next pregnancy outcome within a period of two years or less, while approximately half of those who had a wastage had the next pregnancy within this time interval. The consistency of the difference at each pregnancy number is worthy of note.
The differences in spacing by previous pregnancy outcome are even more evident when we look at the cumulative percentage distribution of the spacing of pregnancy events as show in Figure 4. Within 24 months of the last pregnancy

outcome, only one-third of the women whose first pregnancy outcome was a live birth had a second pregnancy outcome, whereas at least two out of three of those who had a wastage had the next pregnancy outcome within this time interval. Nearly eight out of ten of the women who had an involuntary abortion had their next pregnancy outcome within the two-year period. A very similar pattern of difference is noted in Figures 3 (percentage distribution) and 5 (cumulative percentage) for the spacing intervals to the third pregnancy by the outcome of the second pregnancy. Although the data are not shown here, the same general pattern of difference in spacing by previous pregnancy outcome was also found when we examined the spacing intervals between the third and fourth pregnancy.

PREGNANCY OUTCOME B Y SPACING
In the following discussion, our attention is focused on the impact that spacing has on the outcome of subsequent pregnancy events. It is hypothesized that the wastage rate will be higher among women who more closely space their pregnancies than among those who space their pregnancies over a longer time interval. It is assumed here that the latter would be in better physical conditions to produce a live birth than those who had experienced closely spaced pregnancies. The evidence presented in Table 5 confirms our hypothesis at each pregnancy number. Except for voluntary terminations, the wastage rate is highest among the more closely spaced outcomes.
It should be cautioned that our spacing interval, which is the time span between

outcomes, we find the pattern of difference shown in Table 5 is noteworthy.
Clearly there is a substantial excess of infant deaths and stillbirths among the more closely spaced outcomes. The loss rate is approximately double among the more closely spaced outcomes up through the fouth pregnancy and jumps to nearly a fourfold excess at the higher pregnancy numbers. A similar pattern is found for involuntary abortions also; but in spite of the bias favoring short time intervals, the size of the difference is much less marked. Contrary to expectations, just the opposite pattern is found for terminations. As

5 In the above analysis we have combined the two shortest intervals used in Table 3 because of the bias of the shortest interval associated with events that did not run full term. However, in a separate analysis of the shorter interval (under 24 months), we observed the same pattern of difference for each type of wastage, but for the shorter interval we found the differences to be even more marked than those shown in Table 5. In other words, the shorter the spacing interval, the higher the loss rate. The relationship is found to be linear for all types of losses except for voluntary terminations. After the third pregnancy, the termination rate starts higher for the shortest spacing interval (under 24 months) but declines for the next interval (25 to 44 months), then reaches a peak among those with the longest spacing interval (45 months or more). Losses due to involuntary abortions are much higher when a shorter interval is used in the analysis, but, as noted, this is to be expected because of the bias of how the spacing interval is measured.
