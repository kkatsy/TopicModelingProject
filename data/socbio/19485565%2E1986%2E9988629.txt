ABSTRACT: The opportunity for selection was estimated in the rural population of Visakhapatnam District, Andhra Pradesh, India. The index of total selection was found to be low. Selection in relation to birth control reveals that opportunity for selection is lower among the women who completed their fertility by family planning methods than in women who completed their fertility by attaining menopause. Further, the results showed that differential fertility and mortality make equal contributions to the total measure of selection in both groups.

Differences in fertility and mortality levels in various groups in a population are of great significance in understanding the structure of a population. In a developing country like India, there is the specter of mass family planning programs involving hormonal methods and sterilization camps to control overcrowding. Since the early 1960's, more than fifty studies have investigated how family planning programs may have changed the course of fertility, either that of acceptors or of the general population, leading to differential fertility (Forrest and Ross, 1978).
Changing fertility and mortality patterns due to socioeconomic forces have a profound effect on natural selection in human populations (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971). Of these forces, birth control is the most important factor which affects natural selection through differential fertility. Crow (1958) suggested one possibility for measuring intensity of natural selection and derived a total index of opportunity for selection, which was later modified by Johnston and Kensinger (1971). This index takes

into account fertility and mortality differences.
In the present study an attempt is made to estimate the selection intensities and its variation due to family planning in the rural area of Visakhapatnam District, Andhra Pradesh, India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Demographic data were collected during 1979 in the rural area of Visakhapatnam. Visakhapatnam is a coastal district in the state of Andhra Pradesh. Twenty-two villages were randomly selected for the study. Reproductive histories were obtained from the women respondents of these villages through personal interview in a house-to-house survey. A total of 1,570 women were interviewed, and among them 1,544 women had ever been pregnant. In spite of a thorough investigation, we were unable to get accurate information on prenatal losses because the respondents generally could not recall all prenatal losses and also were hesitant to give this information due to a kind of social

stigma. When their reproductive histories were collected, women respondents were asked to give information regarding the adoption of family planning methods.
Data were then analyzed to compute the fertility and mortality components of the population. For the estimation of selection intensities, only the reproductive histories of women who had completed their fertility were utilized. To study the effect of family planning on selection, women with completed fertility were divided into two groups, women who completed their fertility naturally by attaining menopause (hereafter, WCFM) and women who completed their fertility artificially by permanent family planning methods (hereafter, WCFFP). Of the two groups, 199 women belonged to the former and 418 women belonged to the latter group.

below thirty years of age. The general fertility rate of the population is 4,071 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age. The average inbreeding coefficient is 0.030 indicating that consanguinity is higher in this rural population.
Table 2 shows the average number of live births, living children, and postnatal deaths among women of completed fertility. Mean number of live births and living children are higher for the WCFM than WCFFP group. Though the WCFFP group have fewer live births, the net reproductive index is almost equal in both the groups, suggesting that postnatal mortality is lower in the WCFFP group.
Opportunity for selection computed according to Crow (1958) and the components of total selection are presented in Table 3. The index of total selection is low when compared to the other Andhra Pradesh populations which re-

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The distribution of mean number of children ever born with respect to maternal age is shown in Table 1. The distribution of live births according to maternal age is in agreement with the demographic fact that the older women, having been exposed to a longer period of reproductive life have a higher number of births. Women of thirty years and older have a higher number of live births than do younger women, i.e., women

ported a highest measure ranging from 0.7240 to 1.1859 (Murty and Ramesh, 1978), and it comes under the category of lower opportunity for selection among human populations. (Spuhler, 1976). The fertility component contributes nearly 50 per cent to the total measure of Crow's index, indicating that the fertility and mortality components make equal contributions to the total index of selection as in the Kotas of Nilgiri (Basu, 1972) and tribal populations of Andhra Pradesh (Murty and Ramesh, 1978).
The total selection intensity along with fecundity, computed according to Johnston and Kensinger (1971), is given in Table 4. The "/" is slightly higher than in Crow's index, and the trend is the same in both computations. However, here the contribution of total mortality adds more to the total measure of selection than does the fertility compo-

nent. In comparison with other populations, the index of prenatal mortality is low in the present population. It was reported as 0.05 in a Muslim population of West Bengal (Barua, 1976); 0.106 and 0.04, respectively, in the Colonsay and Jura populations of the Inner Hebrides (Sheets, 1979). The low prenatal mortality index may be due to the recall lapses of reproductive history or unrecognizable early abortions among the rural women.
The study of selection in relation to birth control reveals that there is a lower opportunity for selection among the WCFFP group than among the WCFM group. It can be noted that higher selection intensities are associated with higher mean live births or pregnancies and higher mortalities. According to Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer (1971), the opportunity for selection through differential fertility is influenced by birth con-

trol practice and modern medical care which tend to reduce the variance in fertility. In concurrence with the above fact, the variance in fertility is reduced in the WCFFP group. The postnatal selection opportunity is also decreased due to the increased fitness of the child in small families (Rajanikumari and Rao, 1981). This reduced variance in fertility and mortality components may give a low opportunity for selection in the WCFFP group.
From these selection intensities it is clear that among rural populations in a developing country like India, fertility and mortality components make essen-

tially equal contributions to the potential selection. In developed countries like the United States the mortality component contributes only a small fraction to the total index under the great influence of improved health conditions. In the present study, the relative contribution of the differential mortality component to selection is high at the postnatal stage. This high postnatal mortality index may be due to environmental fators such as infectious and endemic diseases, inadequate medical facilities, and public health conditions etc., which in turn exert their influence on the fitness of the population.
