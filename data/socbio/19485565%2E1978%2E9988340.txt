ABSTRACT: A curve of age-specific fecundability ratio (to the level at age 20-24) is estimated. The rising part of the curve is estimated from Taiwanese data of the first conception delay according to the harmonic mean method; the declining part, from Hutterite data according to a proposed model of marital fertility rate. Heterogeneous fecundabilities and homogeneous aging effect among women in each age group are assumed. The estimated declining path of fecundability is found to be different from that of the fertility rate.

Fecundability as a fundamental determinant of fertility has been the subject of considerable research in the last two decades. Because of the complexity of the reproduction process and associated data problems, the results of fecundability estimates based on various models have not been very specific. We know only that a woman's fecundability starts from a low level at menarche, increases to a maximum level in the first half of her twenties, and then begins to decline at some point until it reaches zero again some time before menopause. We have not yet seen an empirically estimated age-specific curve representing the whole cycle of this rise and fall of fecundability for any human group. The need for such specific information is increasing, partially because of advances in the area of family planning, particularly in the area of simulation modeling. In this paper, we take a step toward fulfilling this need by estimating and constructing a composite cycle of the age-specific relative change of fecundability.
THE PROBLEM
Fecundability is conceptually defined as the probability that a fertile married

woman, using no contraception, will conceive in a menstrual cycle. The time unit is usually replaced by a calendar month in constructing models. The various modeling approaches differ in relating this probability to different reported events: monthly proportion of conception, conception delays,1 intervals between live births, number of children, etc. (for survey and methodological criticisms, see Holmberg, 1970, and Menken, 197S). Since data on an individual woman are hardly adequate for any statistical estimation of her monthly probability of conception, the use of models for learning about the change of fecundability with age has always been by estimating the mean fecundability of a group of women. The key questions are whether the group is age-specific and whether women in the group are assumed to have identical fecundability.
An assumption of identical fecundability within a group drastically simplifies a model but is not theoretically sound. As will be shown, the bias in an estimate
1 Conception delay is the time length between the beginning of a susceptible (fecundable, exposure, risk) period and a conception. Measured in discrete months, the conception delay months is one month more than the susceptible months as the first includes the month of conception while the second does not.

There are many outcomes of a conception (early fetal waste, miscarriage and stillbirth, abortion, live birth) with each one being followed by a different random length of post-partum nonsusceptible period which is difficult to identify.

In short, in constructing a complete curve of the relative changes of fecundability with age, one may first search for data that provide most age-specific means of the first conception delay. After that, a model has to be devised to estimate the relative changes in those age groups not covered by the data of the first conception delay. The model should relate the distribution of fecundability in each age

2 The Hutterites are a Protestant sect living in the Dakotas, Montana, and the adjacent portions of Canada in small agricultural settlements. The sect originated in Switzerland in 1528, and the ancestors of the American Hutterites came to this country in the 1870's. Not only is the practice of contraception condemned by Hutterite religion and custom, but the communal structure of the settlements removes any economic incentive toward family limitation. As a result, their number has increased from 443 in 1880 to more than 8,500 in 1950(Tietze, 1957), which is to say that the sect has increased over 19 times its size in a period of 70 years. The birth rate of the Hutterites is the highest on record, while the death rate corresponds to that of the general population of the United States. Finally, in contrast to other groups where there is little migration, where no birth control measures are used, and where reproduction proceeds without conscious planning, Hutterite vital statistics are unusually reliable (Eaton and Mayer, 1954).

THE RELATIVE CHANGE IN FECUNDABILITY OF HUTTERITE
WOMEN
Since the data of vt after the first conception is scarce and unreliable, we abandon the simple ratio method and propose in this section a model for the purpose of estimating qt for t > 24. The formulation of the model starts from relating the expected live births by a woman per year to the expected time interval between her two conceptions. This part, which is similar to the model proposed by Henry (1961a) and Perrin and Sheps (1964), is simple. This micromodel can be aggregated to a macromodel of age-specific marital fertility rate (ASMFR), the data of which is more reliable, by integrating the joint distribution of individual women's reproduction characteristics. To make the integration operative and applicable to Hutterite data, which is still the best published data known to us, we use certain assumptions to limit the distributed characteristics to fecundability and nonsusceptible (unfecundable) time length after a live birth only. Further, we assume Equation (1) and that p*¡ has a beta distribution. Then the remaining task is to solve for qt in the model from all known parameters and variables without knowing the specific distribution of the nonsusceptible time after a live birth. We devise a technique for this task and prove the mathematical inequality that is its basis.
For clarity of presentation, in this section we only show the model, the procedure of application, and the result of applying the model to the Hutterite data. The mathematical proof, the evaluation of variables and parameters in the model

This equation is the same as that in the asymptotic model derived by Perrin and Sheps (1964) who gave more detailed analyses and discussed the assumptions. There are six /-specific parameters in the equation: fa, fa, Uu, U2i, U3i, and p¡. Integrating their joint distribution would yield the aggregate ASMFR. But there is little hope of knowing such a joint distribution.

3 Fetal deaths are divided between early and late fetal deaths because the distribution of the frequency of fetal deaths by duration of pregnancy is bimodal.

These assumptions are slightly weaker than the assumptions of constancy in each individual variable (i.e., fa = fa, fa = & , U2i = U2, U3i = U3). They are sufficient for us to concentrate on the distributions of p, and Uu only. This is consistent with the large fecundability variance estimates in previous work (Bongaarts, 1975; Holmberg, 1972) and with

our empirical knowledge about the significant variation in Uu (Appendix B). Furthermore we assume:
(Hi) p¡ = qpM and p*¡ has a beta distribution among women;
(iv) Uu and p*¡ are independently distributed among women.

Assumption (Hi) follows (1) in the last section, and that beta distribution is, asmentioned, a very general distribution of probability. Assumption (iv) may be justified by the lack of counter-evidence and by our conjecture that the determinants of p*i and Ult are quite different. (One major determinant of Uu is the extent of breast feeding, a behavioristic variable which can be regarded as independent of biological and social determinants of p*¡-)

Since dh* is a beta distribution, its two parameters can be obtained by the sample mean and the sample variance of the first conception delay for women of age 20 to 24.4 We estimated these two parameters from Taiwanese data provided by Jain (1969a) and apply them to the Hutterites. On the other hand, we have no knowledge about dh1. Because of this, we propose the following method by which q in (11) can be solved for.
4 As reported by Potter and Parker (1964), among others, estimates a and b of the parameters of the beta distribution of fecundability can be expressed as a function of the sample mean m and variance v of the first conception delay as follows:
Iv b = (m - l)(o - 1).

in which Flow and Fapp denote the lower

the solution to the following condition:

(14)

The basis for this relation is as follows. Let i b e a continuous variable defined in the interval (A,B) with 0 < A < B < oo. Then it,can be proved (Appendix-A) that the following two inequalities hold for any density distribution dh(x):

combination of its lower and upper bounds:
F =w Flow + (1 - w)FuTM. (IS)

Notice that Flow and Fupp, and therefore F, are a function of q. But for the women in age group 20-24, q has been defined as 1.0. Therefore, the application of Equations (11) through (15) to the data of women in this age group provides the solution for the only known weight w.

Applying this technique to the Hutterite data, we obtain q, for t = 25, . . . , 47. The data used and the evaluations of various variables and parameters are detailed in Appendix B. A special method, the smoothed isotonic regression, that is used in evaluating F is explained in Appendix C. The result of our estimation of q, is presented in Table 2.
We combine our results from Table 1 and Table 2 to construct a composite curve of fecundability ratio in Figure 1. Finally, we also compute the age-specific fertility ratios of Hutterite women (from data in Table B.I, Appendix B, with the average ASMFR of 20-24 years old as the basis5) and plot them in Figure 1for comparison.

The reasons for their increase are rise and decline of human fecundability. discussed in the appendix.

The degree of approximation is probably less precise on the declining part of the curve, as the ASMFR model evokes more assumptions than does the simple harmonic mean method. With this qualification, we may nevertheless, in the light of the general trend shown in the curve, take the new view (1) that a woman's fecundability declines immediately after the first half of her twenties and (2) that the decline is approximately linear all the way to the zero level near her menopause. In the past, most researchers believed or assumed that a woman's fecundability stays at a maximum level until she is 30 or still older and that the decline occurs slowly first and then gradually accelerates (Henry 1961ft, Vincent 1961, Henry, 196S; Jacquard, 1967; Ridley and Sheps, 1966; Barrett and Brass, 1974; Holmberg, 1972). This view is probably based on certain observed decline paths of the ASMFR. In

If one views fecundability as the product of a woman's biological capacity to conceive (potential) and her actual coital frequency, then it should be pointed out that a linear decline of her fecundability does not necessarily imply a linear decline of her biological capacity to conceive. It can be shown that the path of the biological capacity decline must be above the path of fecundability decline if marital coital frequency in fact decreases over age. On the other hand, if one views coital frequency and factors other than the biological capacity as only minor determinants of fecundability, then a linear decline of fecundability reflects a linear decline of biological capacity to conceive. In the future, after we become more certain about the relative changes in both fecundability and coital frequency over age as well as the latter's role in determining the former, we may infer more definitively the changes

The reported mean interval between the first and second child for Hutterite women less than 25 years of age at marriage and without intervening fetal wastage is 18.2 months (Sheps, 1965, p. 74). Since very few of these women married before the age of 20, and less than 10 per cent of these women had not had their first child within two years of marriage (Sheps, 1965), most of the secona children were conceived when fecundability was maximum (20-24

More simply, g* is the isotonic regression of g.
In other words, an isotonic regressiong* of a real valued function g is the closest nondecreasing approximation (in terms of sum of squared errors) to the function g. Such isotonic regression can be computed, using the "pool-adjacent violators" algorithm described in Barlow et. al. (1972, pp. 9-18).
(b) Smoothed isotonic regression. To transform a nondecreasing isotonic regression computed by the pool-adjacentviolator algorithm into a monotonie increasing function, we defined a new function g** which we call smoothed isotonic regression. The values are computed as follows: the value of g** is equal to that of g* for all elements which have not been pooled, and the value of g** associated with an element which has been pooled is equal to the mean of the value of g* associated with the same element and the value of g* associated with the two adjacent elements:
