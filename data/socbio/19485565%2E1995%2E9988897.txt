ABSTRACT: Survey data from a number of developing countries show that a considerable proportion of parous women report that they had their first birth one or more years before they first had sexual intercourse. In this paper, I use data from eight African Demographic and Health Surveys to explore factors that contribute to cross-national differentials in the prevalence of these "immaculate conceptions." The results suggest that this data problem results not only from recall errors, but also from the fact that some respondents misinterpret the question on first sexual intercourse and report their age at the onset of intercourse with either their first or current husband rather than their age at sexual initiation.

Demographic data for several developing countries show that a significant percentage of parous women reported that they delivered their first baby one or more years before having first sexual intercourse. I refer to this phenomenon as "immaculate conceptions1." In this paper, I describe the magnitude of this data problem and explore factors that may contribute to these inconsistencies in the reporting of the timing of first sexual intercourse and first birth using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for eight countries of sub-Saharan Africa as an example.2
1This term is conceptually different from the term "virgin births," which has been used in the anthropological literature to refer to ideologies that explain childbirth without reference to physiological paternity (e.g., Leach, 1966; Spiro, 1968).
2Note that this problem is equally prevalent in some non-African countries (e.g., Brazil and Guatemala; see Blanc and Rutenberg, 19906), as well as

In sub-Saharan Africa, three countries stand out because of their high percentage of immaculate conceptions: Botswana (6.2 per cent), Kenya (11.1 per cent), and Mali (8.8 per cent). Although some data errors are always expected, considering that even uneducated women are aware of the link between sexual intercourse and childbearing, such high percentages of women reporting having sex for the first time more than one year after having their first baby are startling.
The occurrence of these immaculate conceptions must of course be attributed to errors in the data. Hence, one may expect to find a higher prevalence of immaculate conceptions in those countries where data quality is comparatively poor. However, Table 1 shows
in some surveys that are not part of the DHS program (e.g., the Nigeria WFS survey, own calculations).

that there is no clear relationship between the percentage of immaculate conceptions and indicators of data quality. While Mali, Liberia, and Togo all have data of a relatively poor quality, only Mali stands out because of its high prevalence of immaculate conceptions. Similarly, Botswana and Kenya have relatively good data by African standards, but have a high percentage of immaculate conceptions. Clearly, a critical examination of the data is warranted. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to this type of data error may help improve the quality of future surveys.
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO
IMMACULATE CONCEPTIONS
Whatever the cause for the inconsistencies between age at first intercourse and age at first birth, it is clear that immaculate conceptions would be uncommon if there were systematic efforts to cross-validate the information on first intercourse and first birth. In part, this lack of systematic crossvalidation may be due to the setup of the questionnaire. In many demographic surveys, including the DHS surveys, questions about sex, marriage, and childbearing are deliberately asked in different sections of the questionnaire to ensure that the answers would not influence each other. For example, to reduce the likelihood that a never-married woman would be hesitant to report births and/or use of family planning methods, questions about marriage and sexual behavior are not asked until after the birth history and the section on family planning. Consequently, respondents and/ or interviewers may not make the logical connection between the timing of

first sex and first birth when reporting this information. Moreover, crossvalidation of the two events is complicated by the fact that age at first birth is not asked directly, but is calculated from the date of first birth.
There has been much debate about whether questions on sexual activity cause embarrassment to respondents and interviewers (see Blanc and Rutenberg, 1990a; Carael et al., 1990; Cleland and Kalule-Sabiti, 1984; Standing, 1992). Some authors have argued that data on sexual behavior can only be obtained through anthropological methods (Caldwell, 1985; Caldwell et al., 1989), because surveys may not pick up inaccuracies:
Pitfalls in the collection of data on age at first sexual intercourse include responses that are formulated on the basis of expected behavior; difficulty in recalling the age at which one first had sexual intercourse, especially among older women; and the disinclination of women to admit that they had premarital sexual intercourse, especially if it occurred with a partner other than their current one. Unmarried women may overestimate their age at first sexual experience out of a reluctance to admit to having already engaged in sexual relations, or they may underestimate that age if they feel pressure from their peers to be sexually active at a young age (Blanc and Rutenberg, 1991, pp. 163-164).
It is reassuring, however, that respondents appear to be quite willing to talk about their sexual behavior (Blanc and Rutenberg, 1990a, 19906, 1991). Nonresponse rates for age at first sexual intercourse in the African DHS surveys are very low, ranging from 0.1 per cent in Burundi and Ghana to 3.4 per cent in Liberia. Moreover, in most African DHS surveys a large percent-

age of never-married women report that they had sexual intercourse; likewise, many ever-married women admit to having premarital sexual intercourse. Hence, concerns about the sensitivity of the topic may be exaggerated. As Carael et al. (1990) point out, in the not-so-distant past similar doubts have been raised about the quality of data on family planning behavior, and those doubts turned out to be unwarranted as well.
Although it is probably a good idea to maintain a healthy sense of skepticism about the quality of data on sexual intercourse, one must acknowledge that immaculate conceptions may be caused by factors other than the respondents' reluctance or inability to provide information on sexual intercourse. Cross-national differences in the prevalence of immaculate conceptions may result from differences in the extent of data editing and cleaning, but also from differences in the wording, translation, and sequence of questions. For example, if the question on first sexual intercourse immediately follows a set of questions about the first hus-

band, or if the question is translated poorly (see Vaessen et al., 1984; Ware, 1977), some respondents may misinterpret the question and report not their age at first sexual intercourse (i.e., loss of virginity), but rather the age at which they started having intercourse with their first husband. This paper examines to what extent such factors explain cross-national differentials in the prevalence of immaculate conceptions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This paper uses data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) from Botswana, Burundi, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Togo, and Zimbabwe. These surveys were conducted between 1986 and 1989 and contain information on women aged 15-49; sample sizes range from 3,200 in Mali to 7,150 in Kenya. Each survey used here contains information on the respondent's age at first sexual intercourse and age at first birth. Age at first sexual intercourse was obtained directly, age at first birth was obtained indirectly (i.e., calculated) from the respondent's

date of birth, and the date of birth of her first child. The dependent variable, which measures the occurrence of an immaculate conception, is a dummy variable which indicates whether or not age at first birth precedes age at first intercourse. Because age at first sexual intercourse is measured in completed years only differences of at least one completed year can be observed.
RESULTS
DATE EDITING AND CLEANING
Immaculate conceptions may not appear in the published data files because they have been removed during the data-editing stage. Some countries in the DHS program have applied the so-called "rule of one" to correct inconsistencies. If the age at first sexual intercourse exceeded the age at first conception by exactly one year, then the age at first sex was decreased by one year to make the figures consistent (Blanc and Rutenberg, 1990a, 19906; Institute for Resource Development, 1989, p. 131). If the inconsistency was larger than one year, no correction was made, but age at first intercourse coded was "inconsistent." Thus, in countries where the rule of one was used, there are no cases where age at first sexual intercourse exceeds age at first birth by exactly one completed year. Table 2 shows that such is the case for all countries, except for Liberia and Togo.3

In addition to cleaning in the dataediting stage, there may have been field editing by interviewers and respondents. When a respondent does not know at what age she first had intercourse, DHS interviewers are instructed to probe by relating it to how old a woman was when her first child was born, or when she first got married, making sure not to assume that a woman first had sex at the time of first marriage (Institute for Resource Development, 19876, pp. 60-62). No cross-validation of responses is required if the respondent does report her age at first sexual intercourse.
The extent of field editing cannot be evaluated because responses are not flagged for field editing. However, information on the type of reporting of the date of first birth allows us to examine the effect of imputation of missing dates. It is expected that inconsistencies are less likely to occur when dates are imputed completely because no information is available, since imputation is performed consistent with the available information whenever possible:
In most surveys, age at first sex was used as a constraint on the imputation of both date of first union and date of first birth in cases where no other information was available. Thus, the number of cases imputed on the basis of no information will affect the proportion of inconsistent responses (Blanc and Rutenberg, 19906, p. 70).

3For most countries, there is no published information on the use of the rule of one. DHS does not maintain a record of the countries that used the rule of one, since that decision was made individually by each country (DHS, personal communication). Inconsistencies that remain after data cleaning are sometimes noted in the Individual Recode Documentation (see Institute for Resource Development, s.d., for Liberia and Zimbabwe).

The percentage of immaculate conceptions by type of reporting of date of first birth is shown in Table 3. As expected, immaculate conceptions tend to be uncommon when the date of first birth has been imputed completely, except for Liberia and Mali. When the

date of first birth is imputed partially, the prevalence of immaculate conceptions tends to be high, particularly in Kenya. It is clear, however, that date imputation is not responsible for the cross-national differentials in immaculate conceptions, since these differentials also exist for respondents whose date of first birth was not imputed.
RECALL ERRORS
If recall errors account for the inconsistencies between age at first sexual intercourse and age at first birth, then the problem should be less acute, or perhaps nonexistent, for children born recently. For all countries, the percentage of immaculate conceptions is substantially lower for the most recent birth cohorts than for older birth cohorts (Table 3). In Burundi, Ghana, Liberia, and Togo, less than 1 per cent of first births born during the 1980's are immaculate. Nevertheless, in those countries where the problem of inconsistencies between age at first intercourse and age at first birth is most common overall, the most recent birth cohorts also have a high percentage of immaculate conceptions: Botswana

(3.4 per cent), Kenya (6.3 per cent), and Mali (5.1 per cent).4 These results confirm that recall errors contribute to the problem considerably, but also that recall errors alone are not sufficient to account for the variation in the prevalence of immaculate conceptions across countries.
THE QUESTIONNAIRE
Attempts to adapt the standard DHS questionnaire to local socioeconomic and cultural circumstances have introduced some differences between countries. For example, the question on age at first sexual intercourse has been phrased differently in some countries. In Liberia women were asked how old they were when they first did "men business," and in Mali when they first had an "intimate friend." Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine if these different wordings were interpreted similarly by all women.
4In many DHS surveys interviewers sometimes deliberately overestimated the age of young children to avoid having to ask questions about child health (e.g., Arnold, 1990). A more detailed breakdown by year of birth of the first child (not shown) indicates that this type of error has little or no effect on the prevalence of immaculate conceptions.

Apart from these differences in the phrasing of the question on age at first sexual intercourse, the questions that precede the question on first intercourse also differ between countries, but only for ever-married women (Institute for Resource Development, 1987a). Never-married women were always asked if they ever had sexual intercourse and, if so, at what age they first had sexual intercourse. Evermarried women, on the other hand, were asked about their age at first intercourse only after responding to a set of questions relating to their first union. This set of questions varies between countries. The question on first sexual intercourse may follow a question on age at first cohabitation (Botswana, Liberia, Mali, and Zimbabwe), additional questions about the first union (Burundi), questions about residence patterns since the first union (Ghana and Kenya), or a union history, questions about partner choice, and about the respondent's most recent union (Togo).
A sequence of questions that focuses on the first union may be confusing, causing women to report age at first intercourse with their husband, rather than age at loss of virginity. If these additional questions asked of ever-married women cause confusion about the interpretation of the question on first sexual intercourse, then it is expected that ever-married women will be more likely to report immaculate conceptions than never-married women. Moreover, if immaculative conceptions stem from normative reporting that sexual activity started upon marriage, then the problem should be much less prevalent among never-married women. The results

shown in Table 3 confirm that evermarried women are more likely to report an inconsistent age at first intercourse and age at first birth than women whonever married, but the differences are fairly small.
PREMARITAL CHILDBEARING
The possibility that some respondents report age at first intercourse with their current partner rather than age at loss of virginity merits further attention. In such cases offspring from previous sexual relationships will show up as immaculate conceptions. Unfortunately, it is not possible to identify children who were born before the respondent and her first husband started having sexual intercourse. As a proxy, Table 3 shows the prevalence of immaculate conceptions for marital and premarital first births.5 The percentage of immaculate conceptions is consistently higher for premarital births than for marital births.
In Burundi, Ghana, and Liberia, immaculate conceptions are more than four times as common for premarital births than for marital births. In Togo, age at first sex and age at first birth are inconsistent for 9 per cent of respondents who had a premarital birth, as opposed to 1per cent of those who had their first child within wedlock. In the most extreme case, that of Mali, inconsistencies occur for 68 per cent of women who reported a premarital birth, andonly 2 per cent for those with marital first births. It is noteworthy that in Botswana, Liberia, Mali, and
5Women have been coded as having apremarital birth if their age at first birth (in completed years) precedes their age at first union, or if they had a child but have never married.

Togo more than two out of every three immaculate conceptions are premarital births. In Burundi, Ghana, Kenya, and Zimbabwe, this is the case for 28-42 per cent of immaculate conceptions.
It is unlikely that respondents deliberately misreported their age at first sexual intercourse in order to conform with the cultural norms. Indeed, respondents who inflated their age at first intercourse to hide that they were sexually active before marriage, also would deny having a premarital birth. The finding that women who report having a premarital birth are most likely to report an immaculate conception strongly suggests that the information for some respondents refers not to their first sexual relationship, but rather to a subsequent one. The latter may have occurred either because the respondent misinterpreted the question, or because the interviewer erroneously assumed that the respondent was not sexually active before marriage.
We now examine if these bivariate effects persist after controlling for other variables. Table 4 shows the results of a logistic regression analysis estimating the effect of the child's birth status, recall error, date imputation, and the sequence of questions on the likelihood that a woman reported an immaculate conception, after controlling for literacy and place of residence. The impact of imputation is measured by a dummy variable indicating whether or not any imputation of the date of first birth took place. Year of first birth is used as a proxy for the recall time. The effect of the sequence of questions is measured via marital status, because the sequence of questions preceding the question on age at first

sexual intercourse is different for evermarried and never-married women.
Consistent with the bivariate results, two predictors stand out. More recent births are consistently less likely to be reported as immaculate conceptions, and premarital births are significantly more likely than marital births to be reported as such. These multivariate results show that immaculate conceptions are not solely caused by recall problems. Even after controlling for the year of first birth and other variables, birth status has a very strong effect on the likelihood of reporting an immaculate conception. This finding suggests that immaculate conceptions partly result from the fact that some women report not their age at loss of virginity, but rather their age at first intercourse with a subsequent partner (probably their current or their first husband).
It is important to acknowledge that the effects of recall error and birth status, although highly significant in all countries, are not sufficient to fully explain cross-country differentials in the prevalence of immaculate conceptions. The latter would require a thorough examination of the effect of using translated questionnaires, of conducting interviews in languages other than the native tongue of the respondent and/or interviewers, and of differential interviewer quality. For example, in Kenya Interviewers #13 and #14 both interviewed mostly Kalenjin women, but recorded 1.3% immaculate conceptions and 20.0% respectively. This finding may indicate that #13 is a better interviewer. However, since the Kalenjin are a composite ethnic cluster, one interviewer may have interviewed in his/her mother tongue, while

the other did not. Such a detailed examination cannot be conducted on the basis of the published data and is beyond the scope of this paper.
DISCUSSION
While analyzing data quality of demographic surveys is often difficult, inconsistencies between the age at first sexual intercourse and first birth are easy to detect. Since conception cannot occur without having sexual intercourse (ignoring in vitro fertilization), any cases for which first birth precedes first sexual intercourse must be errors. Surprisingly, such inconsistencies are quite common in some countries. The percentage of inconsistent responses ranged from 1 per cent in Burundi to 11 per cent in Kenya. It is not obvious why these inconsistencies have not been noticed by the respondent or interviewer. Most likely, cross-checking the information was difficult because age at first birth is obtained indirectly from the date of birth of the respondent and the date of birth of her first child.

In order to avoid or at least reduce this type of problem in future surveys, it is important to get a better understanding of the factors that may contribute to this type of error. Inconsistencies between the timing of first birth and first sexual intercourse may stem from a number of factors, including differences related to the questionnaire (the wording and translation of questions; the sequence of questions), differential data editing procedures (the "rule of one"), errors due to imputation of missing dates, errors due to reporting of normative rather than actual behavior, as well as recall errors.
The hypothesis that immaculate conceptions may result from the fact that women give normative responses to the question on age at first sexual intercourse is not supported by the data. The normative pattern would be for women to deny having premarital sexual intercourse, by overestimating their age at first sexual experience. For example, in Islamic societies women may overestimate their age at first sexual intercourse because of the strong stigma placed on premarital sexual

intercourse and premarital pregnancies. However, the data indicate that women who had a premarital first birth are significantly more likely than women with a marital first birth to report an immaculate conception, even after controlling for other factors. This pattern holds for all countries. Obviously, it is unlikely that women who want to deny having premarital intercourse will lie about their age at first sexual experience, but admit to having a premarital birth. Consequently, the possibility that women are deliberately overestimating their age at first sexual intercourse must be ruled out. Instead, the results suggest that some women may be confused and report not their age at loss of virginity, but rather their age at the onset of sexual relations with a subsequent partner.
The data support the argument that immaculate conceptions result in part from recall errors in the reporting of the timing of first birth and/or first sexual intercourse. In all countries the prevalence of immaculate conceptions is substantially lower for more recent birth cohorts, and this effect persists after controlling for other factors. The analysis did not reveal a significant impact related to the sequence of questions, data-editing procedures, or date imputation.
This study brings two important issues to attention. First, inconsistent responses may bias research on first sexual intercourse, since age at first intercourse is not coded for such cases. More importantly, if women report not their age at loss of virginity but their age at onset of sexual relations with a subsequent partner, but responses are consistent, then estimates of the mean age at first sexual intercourse will be biased upward.

The second issue that needs to be addressed is how similar problems can be avoided in future surveys. Blanc and Rutenberg (19906, p. 77) suggest trying to reduce the extent to which interviewers compute age at first sexual intercourse on the basis of the date of firstmarriage, perhaps by adding a special code indicating that a respondent reported becoming sexually active upon marriage. It may also be helpful to add an introduction to the question on first sexual intercourse explaining clearly that the enquiry refers to the respondent's age at loss of virginity, rather than the onset of sexual relations with the respondent's first husband or current partner. Alternatively, the distinction could be made explicit by asking both a question on the respondent's age at loss of virginity, and a question on her age at the onset of sexual relations with the first husband. Last, but not least, it seems important to require interviewers to conduct a consistency check for these questions and to record more detailed information about the language of both interviewers and respondents. Survey administrators must also take care to hire only the most qualified interviewers.
