ABSTRACT: This paper compares the mortality experience of foreign- and native-born Irish, Italians, and Jews in New York City in 1979-81. In most cases, denominator data were not available, so proportional mortality analysis was used. An estimation procedure was undertaken to show the degree to which standardized proportional mortality ratios approximate relative standardized mortality measures. Major and lifestyle-related causes of death were examined, as were specific sites of cancer. While no consistent pattern merged which related nativity or ethnicity to the relative distribution of mortality, it does appear that the intra-ethnic patterns of the Irish group were unique relative to those of the Italian and Jewish groups. Overall, this study suggests a number of interesting relationships between ethnicity, nativity, and the distribution of mortality by cause.

This study compares the mortality experience of native- and foreign-born Irish, Italians, and Jews in New York City in 1979-81. Many studies of differential mortality by ethnicity have used immigrant populations but relatively few have compared native-born and foreign-born populations of the same ethnic group. Such a comparison is useful in examining the extent to which the environment of the host country may influence the mortality experience of an ethnic group, as genetic effects are more or less "controlled" for in a study of two generations of the same ethnic group.
Studies of immigrant mortality frequently find that as the period of residence in the host country increases, the mortality pattern of the immigrant population approaches that of the native population. The mortality rates of immigrants are often below those in their country of birth, an advantage that might be attributable to the "healthy mi-

grant" selection bias (Marmot et al., 1984; Kasl and Berkman, 1983). Immigrants are nevertheless frequently at a mortality disadvantage with respect to the native-born population of the host country. Yet, as the length of residence increases, the mortality rates of the immigrants often reach some point between those of the host country and those of their country of birth. In a recent review, Adelstein et al. (1984) comment that migrant studies "show that rates of diseases in immigrants are often broadly similar to rates in their country of origin, and that these may change within the first or later generations towards the risk of the host population. This would point to the influence of environment" (p. 315). This tendency varies greatly by cause of death.
This process of assimilation should ultimately result in the convergence of the mortality patterns and levels of the native-born descendants of the immi-

grants and the native-born population. A Canadian study argues that both the immigration selection effect and the process of assimilation work together to bridge the mortality gap between immigrant and native populations: "Thus, the relative mortality disadvantage of the first generation . . . is overcome by the descendants of the immigrants. It is likely that the rapidity of this process will vary depending on the degree of socioeconomic success of the first generation in the adoptive society" (Trovato, 1985, p. 53). The rapidity of this process would also be expected to vary considerably by cause of death.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The present study examines mortality by cause among persons 45-84 years of age in the foreign- and native-born Irish, Italian, and Jewish populations of New York City in 1979-81. Death record tapes for these years were made available by the City of New York Department of Public Health. These tapes excluded deaths of city residents which occurred outside of New York. Deaths of persons under 45 years of age were not included for our study purposes because there were relatively few deaths. Deaths of those over age 85 were excluded because classification of death to a single cause is more difficult at advanced ages when multiple chronic conditions are frequently present. Major and "lifestyle-related" causes of death were examined, as well as specific cancer sites.
The three ethnic study groups were selected, in part, because they are of sufficient size to permit analysis of both foreign- and native-born populations. As most Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants entered the United States before

1930, there were in 1980 sufficient numbers of middle-aged or older nativeborn children. The foreign- and nativeborn members of these ethnic groups contribute significantly to the overall population of New York, comprising more than one half of the entire white population (excluding Puerto Ricans) between ages 45 and 84 resident in New York City in 1980.
During the years 1979-81 more than 55,000 deaths of persons aged 45-84 years occurred in New York City among those categorized as Irish, Italian, or Jewish. Among the six ethnicity-nativity groups examined here the numbers of deaths ranged from 3,007 for Irish foreign-born persons to 15,434 for Jewish native-born persons. Figures for the numbers of males and females in each group are shown in Tables 2,3, and 4.
A lack of comparable numerators and denominators has complicated the analysis of the mortality patterns of most of the ethnic groups under consideration. Since 1978, the death certificate for New York City has included an item on ethnicity or ancestry. However, for the native-born Italian and Irish groups, and for the foreign- and native-born Jewish groups, these numerator statistics are not compatible with denominator data in the 1980 decennial census. Jews were considered to be only a religious group by the Census Bureau in 1980, and since religion is not asked in a decennial census, their numbers were not recorded (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1983a, p. B-8).
The calculation of mortality rates for the native-born Italian and Irish groups is complicated by procedures for listing and coding ethnicity on the death record and in the census. The death certificate has only a single designation of ethnicity while the census permitted multiple listings. Thus, decedents who may have

been listed, for example, as "ItalianGerman" in the census would have only one ethnicity coded on their death record. In addition, many decedents, primarily those born in the United States were simply described as "American." Whereas only 5 per cent of foreign-born whites were so classified, the level reached 35 per cent among the U.S.born. As a result, it appears likely a substantial number of U.S. -born Italian and Irish decedents were listed as "American." The use of death record counts then would result in a significant undercount of these groups.
In computing rates for a standard population, we used data for the total white population of New York City excluding Puerto Ricans. The latter were excluded because their mortality pattern differs markedly from that of other New Yorkers.1
Despite the absence of appropriate mortality rate data, useful substitute techniques have been developed which make the analysis of mortality possible. Proportional mortality analysis, a "numerator" technique, compares the distribution of deaths among the study population to that of a standard population. By comparing the observed numbers of death by cause with those expected, ratios can be calculated which show excesses and deficits of deaths by cause. In the absence of necessary denominator data, proportional mortality ratios are used in this study.
The possibility of bias in mortality data should be noted. As mentioned previously, procedures concerning the listing and coding of ancestry on death certificates have resulted in an incomplete count of native-born Irish and Italian decedents. Surname analysis has re-

vealed that approximately 25 per cent of U.S.-born decedents with Italian surnames were classified as "American" on their death certificates and were not included in the counts used for this study. Thus, the proportional mortality analysis is not based on a complete count of deaths for native-born Irish and Italians. Furthermore, the error may not be random, since the excluded decedents are those categorized by their families "American," representing perhaps the most assimilated of the second (or third) generation populations.
The excluded population may also include persons with Irish or Italian surnames who are of mixed ancestry. Persons of mixed ancestry should be excluded from this study when possible, because they are not genetically equivalent to the foreign-born populations. Unfortunately, data on the ethnicity of the parents of native-born decedents are not available. In identifying the Jewish decedents, there was a different problem as the death certificate has no item on religion. Instead, the religious.denomination of the cemetery was used. MacMahon and Koller (1957) have found that the decedents buried in Jewish cemeteries are almost exclusively Jewish.
One potential problem in the calculation of proportional mortality ratios was the choice of a standard population. In this study, the standard population was the entire white population, excluding Puerto Ricans, in New York City. Obviously, all six ethnic-nativity groups in the study are also members of this standard population. However, we calculated an alternative set of proportional mortality ratios standardized on the United States white population, and the ratios were not significantly different from those calculated on the New York City standard. Moreover, the distribution of

deaths in New York differs somewhat from that of the United States as a whole. For instance, New York has a relatively higher proportion of deaths from cirrhosis and homicide and a relatively lower proportion of accidental deaths. New York also has a higher frequency of heart disease and a lower frequency of cerebrovascular disease than the rest of the country, but this fact may be due to local practice in classifying causes of death. Based on these considerations, we decided to use as a standard the New York City mortality distribution rather than the U.S. distribution which would introduce distortions that might confound residential and ethnic characteristics.
We had sufficient data to calculate mortality rates for the foreign-born Irish and Italians, whose death records and census classifications had a close correspondence. The denominators for these rates were derived from the 5 per cent sample of the 1980 Census Public Use Microdata files (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1983&). We calculated age- and cause-specific death rates and agestandardized cause-specific rates. The availability of these rates make it possible to test the reliability of the proportional mortality data. In 1978, Kupperet al. outlined a procedure to check the reliability of proportional mortality ratios. It consisted of calculating an approximation measure taken from a ratio of standardized mortality ratios (SMR's) and then constructing a confidence interval to check the closeness of the approximation.
Kupper et al. (1978) have pointed out a basic disadvantage of proportional mortality analysis. As a "numerator" statistic, it measures relative, but not absolute, differences in cause-specific mortality. In other words, a propor-

tional mortality ratio may indicate that a particular population has a significant excess or deficit in the proportional distribution of mortality from a certain cause. The ratio, however, does not reflect absolute differences in the level of mortality by cause and for all causes in the two populations. If the absolute mortality conditions of the two populations differ markedly, then a standardized mortality ratio (a ratio of causespecific mortality rates) may show a relationship between the two populations which is the opposite of that reflected in the proportional mortality ratio. Conversely, standardized mortality ratios do not reflect differences in the relative distribution of mortality by cause. To correct for this, researchers often calculate cause-specific relative standardized mortality ratios (RSMR) by dividing cause-specific SMR's by the SMR for mortality from all causes.
Kupper et al. (1978) note that the standardized proportional mortality ratio (SPMR calculated by taking the ratio for the proportion of deaths from cause i in the test population to the proportion of deaths from cause / in the standard population) is mathematically equivalent to the RSMR. They observe that the standardized proportional mortality ratio, despite the absence of information on the population at risk, appears to provide a short cut to the calculation of the RSMR. This suggests that proportional mortality analysis may be more useful in mortality studies than previously thought. As Kupper et al. (1978, p. 17) comment: "Because of the previously mentioned pitfalls of 'numerator' analysis, proportional mortality rates have been used sparingly in mortality studies. . . .The potential of the SPMR as an important index of mortality appears to have been largely overlooked."

Kupper et al. (1978) have outlined a procedure for calculating RSMR's and SPMR's and constructing a confidence interval at the 0.01 level to test the closeness of the approximation. We used this procedure with the data on causespecific mortality for the foreign-born Irish and Italian groups. In all butfiveof the sixty cases tested, the RSMR fell within the confidence interval around the SPMR. This close approximation of the SPMR to the RSMR provides an important verification of the proportional mortality data used in this study.
RESULTS
INTRA-ETHNIC DIFFERENTIALS
Proportional mortality ratios for the foreign- and native-born Irish, Italian, and Jewish populations, both sexes combined, are shown in Table 1. With regard to the major causes of death, the Irish exhibit the greatest differences between foreign- and native-born populations. Compared with the foreign-born Irish, the native-born Irish have a proportional mortality ratio that is significantly higher for pneumonia and influenza, and significantly lower for stroke, accidents, diabetes, cirrhosis, and homicide. Despite these significant differences between the proportional mortality ratios of the foreign- and native-born Irish groups, there is no definite trend toward convergence with the mortality pattern of the standard population. For half of the major causes of death, the native-born Irish have proportional mortality ratios which less closely approximate the standard population than do the ratios for the foreignborn Irish.
Among the Italian groups, the proportional mortality ratios of the nativeborn group are similar to those of the

foreign-born group for all causes, except for accidents, cirrhosis, and homicide. The proportional mortality ratios of the native-born group for most major causes diverge only slightly from those of the foreign-born group, with the exception of accidents, cirrhosis, and homicide. For the major causes of death, the foreign-born and native-born Jewish groups exhibit similar proportional mortality ratios, with the exception of diabetes, homicide, arid pneumonia, and influenza. The Jewish pattern resembles that of the Italians in that: (1) there is little overall difference between the proportional mortality ratios of the two nativity groups, and (2) the proportional mortality ratios of the native-born groups tend to be lower than those of the foreign-born groups.
For specific types of cancer, the native-born Irish population, compared with the foreign-born population, has proportional mortality ratios that are significantly higher for cancers of the colon, prostate, and esophagus, and significantlylower for cancers of the breast, pancreas, stomach, and leukemia. The proportional mortality ratio of the native-born population is closer to 1.0 than is that of the foreign-born population for cancer of the colon alone; for all seven other types of cancer listed, the native population has a proportional mortality ratio which is further from 1.0. So while there are significant differences in the ratio of observed to expected mortality for specific sites of cancer between the foreign- and native-born Irish groups, these are not due to the mortality distribution of the native-born more closely approaching that of the standard population.
For the Italians, the native-born population compared to the foreign-born population, has proportional mortality

ratios that are significantly higher for cancers of the breast and esophagus and significantly lower for cancer of the stomach and leukemia. For the Jewish groups, the native-born population, compared to the foreign-born population, has proportional mortality ratios that are significantly higher for cancers of the breast and prostate and leukemia, and lower for cancers of the pancreas, esophagus, and stomach. Like the native-born Italians, the native-born Jewish group has higher proportional mortality ratios for some specific cancer sites than does the foreign-born population. However, in the Jewish case, the proportional mortality ratios for the native-born population tend to be closer to the standard population than do the ratios of the foreign-born population.
An interesting finding is that all three native-born populations have proportional mortality ratios that are somewhat higher for lung cancer and significantly lower for stomach cancer than do the foreign-born populations. However, the small number of observed deaths for some of these causes especially for the foreign-born groups must be considered. An examination of the proportional mortality ratios by sex provides more information on the relationship between nativity and mortality. Proportional mortality ratios by sex for the native- and foreign-born populations of the Irish, Italian, and Jewish groups are shown in Tables 2,3, and 4.
Table 2 shows the proportional mortality ratios of the foreign- and nativeborn Irish groups for various causes. For most major causes of death, there is little difference between the male and female populations with the exception of diabetes and cirrhosis. For these causes, the native-born males have a proportional mortality ratio that is lower than

that of the foreign-born males, while females show a reverse relationship. With regard to specific cancer sites there is less similarity between the sexes (Table 2). For lung cancer, the native-born male population has a proportional mortality ratio that is less than that of the foreign-born male population, while females show a reverse relationship.
The Italian populations show considerable similarity between males and females (Table 3). For most major causes, both sexes have proportional mortality ratios that are approximately the same level and show approximately the same differences between nativity groups. One exception is diabetes, where the female proportional mortality ratios are significantly higher than those of the males, for both nativity groups. There is no consistent pattern regarding specific cancer sites. Leukemia is the only cancer in which the relationship between the native- and foreign-born groups' proportional mortality ratios is similar for males and females. Cancers of the stomach and the pancreas show a large difference between the proportional mortality ratios of the two nativity groups, but the direction of the relationship is reversed by sex. There is also a large difference between nativity groups for lung cancer for females, but not for males.
For the Jewish populations, males and females behave similarly for some major causes, namely heart disease, stroke, and pneumonia (Table 4). For cancer and diabetes, the native-born female group has a significantly higher proportional mortality ratio while there is little change among the male groups. For accidents and cirrhosis, the ratio is higher for native-born males and lower for native-born females. For specific cancer sites, the results are somewhat

more consistent. For cancer of the stomach, the native-born Jewish males and females have a proportional mortality ratio that is significantly lower than that of the foreign-born group. For leukemia, the native-born males and females have a much higher proportional mortality ratio. Females show a significant difference between nativity groups for breast and lung cancer; males, for cancer of the pancreas.

cidents, pneumonia and influenza, diabetes, cirrhosis, and cancers of the esophagus, stomach, and leukemia.
Clearly these results are not conclusive as the numbers of the native-born groups do not represent the entire decedent populations. Nevertheless, the tendency for Italian and Jewish proportional mortality ratios to resemble each other relative to the Irish ratio occurs often enough to suggest that the Irish groups studied here have a somewhat different mortality distribution.

Inter-ethnic comparisons are useful in examining differential mortality. We therefore considered the proportional mortality distribution of the three ethnic study groups as a whole. For this purpose, we combined the data on the foreign- and native-born populations and calculated new proportional mortality ratios. The results are shown in Table 5. The usefulness of this table however is somewhat limited. The foreign-born groups are over-represented, as the numbers of deaths for the native-born populations are likely to have been understated. As previously noted, the Irish and Italians, listed as "American" on their death certificate, are excluded from the counts. The members of the Jewish population who were not buried in a Jewish cemetery are excluded, and this is likely to have a greater effect on the figures for the native-born population. It is also important to remember that these figures do not reflect differences in absolute levels of cause-specific mortality, but in the proportional distribution of mortality by cause.
As indicated in Table 5, the Italian and Jewish populations exhibit a similar pattern in proportional mortality ratios relative to the Irish. This pattern is most evident for cerebrovascular disease, ac-

DISCUSSION
The examination of intra- and interethnic differentials in mortality has yielded few consistent patterns, particularly for the foreign- and native-born Irish. The proportional mortality ratios of the native- and foreign-born populations differ widely for most causes of death, with little variation by sex.
The results for native- and foreignborn Italians show that the proportional mortality ratios vary little by nativity groups. With the exception of a few cancer sites, the proportional mortality ratios of the two nativity groups show no significant differences by cause.
The Jewish proportional mortality distribution, like that of the Italians, appears relatively stable between nativity groups (Table 4). Like the Italians, there are some cancer sites, such as cancer of the stomach and pancreas for males and breast cancer for females, where there is a substantial difference between the foreign- and native-born. This finding for breast cancer is supported by Seidman (1971) who, in a study of cancer mortality among ethnic and religious subgroups in New York City, 1949-51, found a high mortality rate for breast cancer among native-

born Jewish women between ages 25 and 64, relative to both the foreign-born Jewish population and the standard population.
In summary, the data suggest that the Irish show significant variation in their proportional mortality ratios by nativity, while the Jewish and Italian populations show more stability across nativity groups. One explanation may be that the foreign- and native-born Irish groups are considerably smaller than the foreign- and native-born Jewish and Italian groups. Consequently, proportional mortality ratios for the Irish are based on a relatively small number of deaths and may be subject to fluctuation.
The foreign-born Jewish and Italians may also represent more cohesive immigrant communities. The major immigration of Jews and Italians into New York City occurred between 1890 and 1923.It is likely that many of the foreign-born Italian and Jewish decedents in this study (all of whom were over 45) entered the United States during this period of massive immigration. Thus, many of the foreign-born Italians and Jews immigrated as children, which would tend to equalize the environmental experience of the foreign- and nativeborn populations of these ethnicgroups. Some supporting evidence for this hypothesis is provided by a study on heart disease among Jewish and Italian workers over age 50 in the New York garment industry in the 1950's. The study reported that approximately 90 per cent of the women and 80per cent of the men in both ethnic groups had been born in Europe but had lived in the United States for more than forty years (Epstein et al., 1957). Although this was a study of a small population, it may be representative of the immigrant experi-

ence of many of the decedents in the foreign-born Italian and Jewish groups.
Large-scale immigration movements such as that into New York during the period 1890-1923 often produce ethnically cohesive communities in which community members of different generations and/or nativities may share characteristics affecting morbidity. Unique linguistic and religious characteristics of the recent immigrants fostered the development of ethnic enclaves or "ghettos" such as the Lower East Side or Little Italy. In such ghettos, foreign- and native-born residents probably shared equally in many European-based cultural practices. Both native- and foreign-born members of these immigrant groups may also have been concentrated in certain occupations, such as the garment industry, where they may have been exposed to occupational risk factors that may affect mortality.
The peak in Irish immigration in the United States, on the other hand, occurred between 1835 and 1865 (Handlin, 1959, p. 47). By the early twentieth century, although predominantly Irish neighborhoods still existed in New York City, they did not serve the same purposes as did Jewish and Italian ghettos, as the Irish were no longer a new group and did not face a language barrier. Irish neighborhoods were likely to be less ethnically homogeneous and to contain relatively fewer foreign-born than Jewish or Italian neighborhoods. It is less likely, therefore, that the foreignborn Irish decedents studied here either entered the United States as children or lived in Irish communities comprised exclusively of both foreign and nativeborn members. It is not surprising that the proportional mortality distribution of foreign- and native-born groups is the least similar for the Irish who, relative to

the Jews and Italians in New York City, are a smaller and less cohesive immigrant group.
Table 5 indicates a relatively unique pattern of proportional mortality ratios for the Irish population compared to the Jewish and Italian groups. As proportional mortality is a relative measure, excessive proportional mortality ratios from certain causes must be compensated for by deficient ratios from other causes. In terms of absolute mortality, however, the Irish have long been considered a high mortality population. In fact, a recent analysis of cause-specific death rates for the same foreign-born Irish and Italian groups studied here found that Irish males and females had age- and cause-specific death rates significantly higher than those of the standard population for almost every major cause and for many cancer sites (Rosenwaike and Hempstead, 1989). In particular, the Irish had excessive mortality rates for causes of death associated with alcohol use, such as cirrhosis of the liver, pneumonia and influenza, accidents, and cerebrovascular disease. The proportional mortality distributions for the Irish groups in the present study are consistent with these conclusions. Therefore, it is likely that the similar pattern of proportional mortality observed in the Jewish and Italian populations has more to do with the uniqueness of the Irish group's mortality than with any strong relationship between the other two ethnic groups.
CONCLUSIONS
This study found no overall pattern of association between nativity and mortality but did find several interesting relationships. In summary, the two nativity groups of the Jewish and Italian

populations showed little variation in the proportional mortality distributions, with the exception of several cancer sites. The Irish population, on the other hand, had substantially different proportional mortality distributions for the foreign- and native-born groups, but there was no discernible pattern. It was suggested that the relative similarity between the Italian and Jewish nativity groups, as opposed to the Irish nativity groups may be a function of the relative size of these immigrant groups, and the likelihood that many in the Jewish and Italian groups immigrated at a younger age. Native- and foreign-born Jews and Italians also may have been more likely than the Irish to live in ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods where the differences between the foreign- and native-born would be minimized. From an inter-ethnic standpoint, it was noted that evidence from the present study and from previous research suggests that Irish immigrants and their descendants are, in absolute terms, a high mortality group, and in relative terms, have particularly high death rates and proportional mortality ratios for causes of death associated with alcohol use. This study has provided only minor evidence of "assimilation" of immigrants to the mortality pattern of the standard population, but it must be remembered that the native- and foreign-born study populations were the same age at the same point in time. Thus, many of the nativeborn are not the children of immigrants 45-84 years old, but rather are the children of still older (or more likely, deceased) persons not included in the study. If many members of the foreignborn groups immigrated at a young age, then nativity has only minimal significance. This study has, however, shown that a number of potentially interesting

relationships exist between nativity, ethnicity, and mortality.
Desirable avenues for future research include comparing mortality data on immigrants and native-born members of the same ethnic group in the United States with data from the countries of origin. Additionally, our hypothesis that ethnic community cohesiveness (e.g., ethnic homogeneity in Italian and Jewish neighborhoods) affected the similarity of mortality patterns for Italians and Jews could be rigorously tested with a multivariate

analysis which would control for characteristics of the decedent's environment.2
