The One-Person Household in Latin America: A Brief Note

Historians and demographers have traced a large increase in the proportion of the United States population comprised of "primary" individuals, principally those who live alone (Kobrin, 1976a; see also Sweet and Bumpass, 1988). In his overview of family and household change in Europe, Keilman found a similar rise in one-person households there since World War II, especially in northwestern Europe (1987). In demographic terms, the rise is associated with the growing proportion of the elderly population and a growing tendency among young adults (until recently) to leave the parental home before marriage. There is disagreement, however, whether the rise has also been influenced primarily by greater affluence (Michael et al., 1980) or changing ideas (Pampel, 1983). Rather than trying to assess change in one-person households elsewhere, this note simply offers a comparative perspective on what the situation may be currently in the rest of the world, especially Latin America, because most people live with others in families.
A WORLD-WIDE VIEW
The proportion of households comprised of only one person is shown in

Table 1 for selected countries of the world. One must be cautious about interpreting such figures too literally because of potentially large differences in the definition of "household" as well as in more general matters of censustaking. However, if the figures have any meaning, they suggest that oneperson households are most prevalent in countries of the "Western culture group," followed by South and East Europe, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East. They suggest that there is a definite difference between the West and Latin America.
Japan exhibits a figure similar to those of Western countries, although its traditional family ideology has emphasized the coresidence of different adult generations (see Palmore and Maeda, 1985). Since Japan is a highlyindustrialized country, and has a large elderly component to its population, it can be used to study the general importance of industrialization on household composition. Baranwal and Ram (1985) explored the hypothesis that "solo" living is positively related to societal development, having found the situation in Japan particularly intriguing. While inconclusive, their findings reinforced the notion that the "tradi-

tional family" has an important impact on the prevalence of one-person households.
COMPARING THE UNITED STATES AND
SEVERAL LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES
While providing an important overview, the figures in Table 1 (if we can trust them) tell us nothing about who lives in one-person households. Research on the United States has found primary individuals to be mainly young and never-married or old and formerly-married (Kobrin, 19766; Ruggles, 1988). Researchers suggest that there is an important life-course dimension to being a primary individual in a family system that is oriented toward the nuclear family (see also Belcher, 1967).

Table 2 contains estimates of the proportion of individuals in households at various ages who resided in one-person households in the mid 1970's for several Latin American countries and who were "nonfamily householders" in the United States in 1980. Age groups are aggregated in accord with the hypothesis to account for the relatively small number of singleperson household members in the Latin American countries. The "nonfamily householder" is as close as the

1980 United States Census comes to tabulating single-person household members.
From Table 2, one can see that the proportion of older people in the United States who are nonfamily householders stands at almost 23 per cent. Persons 18-34 years old have the second largest proportion, more than 11 per cent. The age group with the lowest proportion is 35-54 years of age. In contrast, and despite the tremendous range in figures, the relationship between age and residing in a oneperson household is positive in the six Latin American countries. Persons 20-34 years old have the lowest proportion residing in such households,

while the oldest group has the highest proportion.
Since a majority of the nonfamily householders in the United States are either older formerly-married individuals or young never-married individuals, Table 3 shows the proportion of one-person households comprised of such individuals compared to nonfamily householders in 1980 in the United States. Despite a large diversity in the figures, we can see that compared to the United States, a larger proportion of one-person household residents fall outside those two groups in the Latin American countries.

Latin America is probably conjugally oriented (Todd, 1985), and the proportion of older people there in oneperson households could be of concern. Yet it should be noted that a majority of elderly people reside in extended households and that there is little variation in this tendency by rural/ urban residence (De Vos, 1990). Likewise, young adults are expected to live independently once they are married and especially after a child or two comes along, but most do not leave their parental home until marriage (see De Vos, 1989). Equally critical is the situation of many middle-aged individuals, many of who live in one-person households. In addition to the prevalence of marital disruption among this age group, it is possible that migration has a large disrupting effect on the family life of the middle-aged.
Whatever the reason may be for the

figures, we can conclude that the situation in Latin America is different from that of nonfamily householders in the United States at present. Whether it will change to accord more closely with the United States pattern in the future is an open question.
