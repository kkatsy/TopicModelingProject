This study is concerned with trends and variations in childspacing in relation to age at marriage, order of birth, education of woman, and occupation of husband.1
Relatively few studies have been made on childspacing and those are mostly .based on small samples. Among the important ones are the Princeton Study (Westoff et al., 1961) in which childspacing is a significant variable for prediction of the third child for couples with two children. A more recent study on fertility and family planning in the United States (Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966) based on data from a survey of 3,322 wives in 1960 deals mainly with the analysis of data related to expectations of births. Only one chapter is devoted to socioeconomic differences in age at marriage and spacing of births by order for several birth cohorts of women. In contrast, the data used in this paper are based on official sources, the 1960 decennial census (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1968) and the 1965 Current Population Survey (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969), and are somewhat limited in scope as compared with the two studies mentioned above. Their advantage, how-

ever, over the other data is that they come from larger samples and thus lend themselves to more conclusive results.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The ideal data for studies of childspacing of course would be complete rosters of birth dates of all children born alive to a couple, including deceased offspring and those away from home. However, truncated birth rosters are often used to save space on the schedule, or money, or both. The 1965 Current Population Survey included a truncated birth roster to the extent that the collected data included birth dates of the first four children, the next-to-last, and the last child of fifth or higher order. The birth dates for children intermediate between the fourth and next-to-last were obtained through linear interpolation (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969).
Notwithstanding their limitations, the data enable us to examine the impact of age at marriage, education, and occupation of husband on the cumulated childbearing rates and intervals between first marriage and first birth and between successive births. We shall begin with a consideration of cumulated births by age at marriage and by order of birth for marriage cohorts between 1940 and 1964.

AGE AT MARRIAGE
Age at marriage is inversely related to the number of children ever born. Some demographers claim that changes in marriage patterns do not have much effect on the ultimate number of children because most women marry early enough to have as many children as they desire. However, in this study, tabulations of fertility by age at marriage show that there exists an inverse relationship between age at marriage and fertility (see Table 1). Age at marriage may be in-

surge in marriages and births. As a consequence, women in each marriage cohort considered after 1944 had borne more first children and in shorter intervals since marriage. Specifically, the cumulated first birth rate per thousand women two years after marriage among white women was 491 for those first married in 1940-44; 593 for those married in 1945-49; 620 for those married in 1950-54; and 677 for the marriage cohort of 1955-59. The rate for the marriage cohort of 196O-642 was practically the same, 673.

versely related to the number of children women want. It is also possible that women who marry early or have their children earlier at marriage are exposed to a longer period of risk of having unwanted children.
ORDER Or BIRTH
First births.--The first-birth rates per thousand women for the 1940-44 marriage cohort were the lowest among all of the 1940-64 marriage cohorts considered (see Table 2). This was a cohort of women who married during the war years and thus many husbands were absent from home. After the end of the World War II there was an up-

Within 36 months after first marriage women in the 1955-59 marriage cohort had borne 783 first children compared with 766 for women in the 1960-64 cohort (see Table 2). This decrease in first births among the most recent marriage cohorts after 36 months possibly was due to an increase in age at marriage and postponement of first births, a view that has been expressed by other demographers.
Second births.--Womenwho married during 1945-59 not only had more first births

but also more second births at shorter intervals than did women in the earlier marriage cohort. The number of second births per thousand women for the 1955-59 marriage cohort was 733 after seven years of marriage, and the number of first births per thousand women for the same period of time was 894 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969, Table 17), i.e., the cumulated birth rate for children of second order was 82% as large as that for first birth order. However, for the 1960-64 marriage cohort there was a slight decline in number of second births per thousand women as compared with the 1955-59 cohort. After 36 months of marriage, the cumulated second birth rate per thousand women for the 1960-64 cohort was 319 compared with 334 for the 1955-59 cohort. For both marriage cohorts, however, the cumulated second birth rates were about 42% as high as the cumulated first birth rates after 36 months of marriage (see Table 2).
Births of third and higher order.--The 1945-49 cohort also experienced an increase in cumulative birth rates for children of third order (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969, Table 17). There is no satisfactory information available for children of fourth or higher order since the cohorts have not been married long enough to produce enough births of fourth and higher order. Neither is satisfactory information available for the 1960-64 marriage cohort with regard to third or higher order births.
S0CI0EC0N0MIC CHARACTERISTICS
Education.--For most of the marriage cohorts considered, the cumulative first and second birth rates for women with four years of high school were similar to those who reported some college. Women with less than four years of high school tended to exhibit somewhat higher childbearing rates. The major difference between those with less than four years of high school and the two other groups was in the spacing of the first

and second births; women who reported less than four years of high school tended to have shorter intervals between first and second births than those with four years of high school or with one or more years of college (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969, Table 19).
The most pronounced difference in cumulative childbearing by education can be observed for the third and higher order births. The number of third and fourth or higher order births per thousand women was larger for women with less than four years of high school than for those with four years of high school, and that in turn was somewhat larger than for women reporting one or more years of college. Concomitant with large cumulative birth rates for women with less than four years of high school were short intervals between marriage and third and fourth order births (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969, Table 19).
For women married between 1940-59 there tends to be an appreciable inverse relationship between the number of first births per thousand women and educational attainment. For the 1950-59 and 1945-49 cohorts, however, women with one to three years of high school had larger cumulative first birth rates in the first and later years of marriage than any other educational group (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1960, Table 36). This is in variance with the 1960 census data on the relation between level of education and number of children ever born. The relatively high rates of first births among women reporting one to three years of high school may be due partly to selection, i.e., some women with one to three years of high school may have dropped out of high school in order to be married.
Birth intervals.--The length of intervals between births is to some extent a rough indication of future family size or patterns of family formation. In general, the average length of interval between marriage and first birth and also between successive births is inversely related to the number of children

a woman had borne. However, a short interval between marriage and first birth emphasizes a pattern of an early family formation.
The average length of interval between marriage and first birth for white women ever married, who were 35-39 years old in 1960 and who had an only child, was 43.2 months compared with an interval of 31.4 months for those with two children only. Similarly, the average length of interval between marriage and first birth for women with 3 children was 23.7 months compared with 19.8 months for those women who had borne 4 children (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1960, Table 25).
The length of interval between marriage and first birth increases consistently with the educational level of women. This held true not only for all women having one child or more, but also for those having an only child. However, this was not the case for intervals between successive births among women of a specific parity. For example, the average length of interval between first and second births for women 35-39 years old who had only two children was 51.8 months for high school graduates and 54.3 months for those with less than eight years of school. The average interval between births of second and third children for women with three children was 50.9 months for women who completed high school and 52.1 for women with less than eight years of school. Also there was a rather consistent tendency for intervals to be longer among women reporting one to three years of high school than for women of higher educational status (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1960, Table 25.)
Like the findings described above, the length of intervals between births of a given order was inversely related to the number of children the woman had borne (see Table 3). However, there was less of a tendency for the 1965 survey data than for the 1960 census data to yield a direct positive relation between education and length of interval.

Among women with three or more children the median length of interval between the first and second children and second and third children was larger for women with four years of high school than for those with less or more education (see Table 3). Among those having two children there was an inverse relation of median length of interval to education of women. There was no noticeable relationship between education of woman and length of interval between third and fourth or higher order birth (Table 3).
Sampling variations might help account for the lack of a direct relation. It is possible that women with college education wanted to have their children without a long delay, since they married at an older age than those who did not attend college. As for the relatively long intervals observed for the women with one to three years of high school, the excess was generally small. Whatever the reason, the important point is that when both age and parity are controlled there is little relationship between education and length of interval for first and higher order births.
Occupation.--In general, there exists an inverse relationship between cumulative birth rates and occupational rank of husband for each marriage cohort between 1940 and 1959. The lowest cumulative fertility rates per thousand women were for the wives of professionals and clerical and sales workers and the highest for the urban unskilled workers and for the farmers and farm laborers. Comparison of the data by cohorts suggests that between 1945 and 1959 there was a narrowing of fertility rate differentials between unskilled laborers and operatives and kindred workers.
It is also apparent (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1960, Table 37) that service workers tended to have as low or even lower fertility than professional workers. The explanation sometimes given for the relatively low fertility of clerical workers possibly is applicable here also. Thus, clerical and service

workers may have aspirations of the professional workers and relatively low income. In order to achieve the goals set by the professional class they try to control fertility (see Kiser, Grabill, and Campbell, 1968). It should be also mentioned that there exist only small differentials between farmers, farm managers, and farm laborers.
The 1965 Current Population Survey data on cumulated births by order were tabulated by four classes with reference to the occupation group of husband: white collar, blue collar, service workers, and farm laborers. The last two groups were too small for a cross-classification by order of birth and had to be omitted. The cumulated birth rates for white collar and blue collar workers yielded differentials like those by education (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969, Table

23), For each cohort and each order of birth considered, the cumulated fertility rate by duration of marriage was consistently lower for the white collar than blue collar classes.
SUMMARY
This paper discusses the impact of age at marriage and education of wife on cumulative birth rates of first and higher order for white women married between 1940 and 1964.
Education of wife was in general inversely related to the cumulated birth rates for first and higher orders. However, women who completed one to three years of high school exhibited somewhat higher birth rates than did wives of less education. Perhaps women with one to three years of high school were

selective of women who either wanted or had to get married early.
The average interval between successive births for white women 35 to 39 years oldin 1960 was inversely related to the number of children that the women had borne. In relation to educational attainment of woman, the average length of interval between first marriage and first birth showed the expected direct relation. Forintervals between successive births of second and higher order this relationship did not hold consistently. For example, in some instances the average interval for women with less than eight years of school was longer than for those

with college education. Women with one to three years of high school consistently manifested somewhat longer intervals than women of the same parity in other educational groups. No satisfactory explanation is available.
Occupational rank of husband was inversely related to the cumulative first and higher order births for each marriage cohort under consideration. Professional workers, clerical and sales workers, and service workers tended to have relatively low cumulative fertility rates and farmers, farm laborers, and urban laborers tended to have rather high cumulative birth rates.
