ABSTRACT: Using information provided by institutions handling Jewish deaths, this study identified 735 deaths among Jewish residents of Rhode Island during 1979-81. Official death records then provided data on the characteristics of the deceased and on cause of death, allowing comparisons of Jewish/non-Jewish patterns of mortality and cause of death, as well as analysis of differentials among the Jewish decedents, taking account of birthplace and occupation. The findings indicate that relatively fewer Jewish males die at ages below 65, and more at ages 85 and over than is true of total white males. Jewish females exhibit an age-at-death pattern more similar to that of all white women. These sex differences characterize cause of death as well. Differences are more pronounced between Jewish and non-Jewish males than between the female groups. Most noteworthy, Jewish male deaths from diabetes are significantly higher and deaths from respiratory disease significantly lower than among total white men. Differentials in age of death between Jewish native-born and foreign-born are largely a function of their differential age composition, and socioeconomic status showed no clear relation to age at death or cause of death.

Although considerable interest exists in Jewish mortality patterns and how they compare to those of other ethnic/ religious subgroups in the American population, only a limited number of studies have undertaken such analyses. Research is problematic because information on religion is not collected either in the U.S. census or on vital records. Definitive large-scale studies are therefore difficult and rare, and our knowledge of ethnic/religious differentials in mortality must perforce be built up from the accumulated evidence of small-scale studies covering diverse subgroups at various points in time. Nonetheless, interest in the possible distinctiveness of Jewish mortality can be expected to grow with the increased aging of both the Jewish and American populations.
Studies for St. Louis (Gorwitz, 1962), New York (Seidman et al., 1962), and

Providence (Goldstein, 1966) identified a number of differences between Jews and non-Jews: Mortality was generally lower at younger ages for Jews than non-Jews;the reverse pattern characterized older ages. The pattern was more typical of Jewish males, however, than of females, whose mortality quite closely resembled that of non-Jewish women. These studies all indicated that the survival of the Jews to older ages reflected a substantially lower rate of infant mortality and a relatively lower incidence of the infectious diseases fatal to younger persons. As a result, relatively more Jews lived to those ages plagued by the chronic diseases.
The present study explores mortality patterns of the Jews of Rhode Island during 1979-81 and compares them to those for the state's entire white population in 1980 and, on a limited basis, to

stitutions contacted, we estimate virtually complete coverage of Jewish deaths during the period.
Each of the names was then checked in the death records maintained by the Rhode Island Registry of Vital Statistics. The information obtained from the published obituaries and additional listings was cross-checked for accuracy and augmented when necessary. Additional data abstracted from the death certificates included marital status at time of death and causes of death as coded on the death certificate.
The analysis which follows examines the characteristics of the Jewish decedents, including age, sex, place of birth, and socioeconomic status as denned by occupation. Whenever possible, comparison will be made with the total white population of Rhode Island. Because only 735 deaths, about evenly divided between men and women, were identified for the three-year period, only a limited number of controls can be introduced at any one time; and since most of the Jewish deaths were to men and women over age 45, only very limited analysis of deaths to younger persons

was undertaken. Since rates cannot be calculated for the Jewish population in general, comparisons with non-Jews must be restricted to differential distributions by age.
RESULTS
MORTALITY PATTERNS
Age at death. Previous research has indicated more favorable death rates among Jews compared to non-Jews at younger ages, and the reverse pattern at older ages. The data available for Rhode Island Jews for 1979-81 (Table 1) conform to the expected patterns for both men and women. For example, among men, a significantly lower percentage of deaths occurred to Jews under age 65 (20.3 per cent) than to nonJews (34.6 per cent). The differential was reversed for each of the higher age groups of men; Jewish women had slightly lower mortality at ages 65-74 and 85 and over. For both sexes, median age at death is higher for Jews than for total whites, by 3.6 years for men and 3.2 years for women.

quarter occurring to persons under age 65. Sex differentials in age at death are also much more pronounced among the native-born than the foreign-born. Among the native-born men, 8 per cent died before age 45, compared to only 3 per cent of the women. At the other end of the age scale, just under half the deaths to women were at ages 75 and over, but only 30 per cent of the male deaths occurred at these late ages. Reflecting these patterns, median age at death for the native born was much younger than for foreign born, and the median for female natives was four years higher than for male natives.
These age-sex differentials by placeof-birth status may in part reflect the differential composition of the native- and foreign-born Jews. Since the nativeborn are more evenly distributed among the various age groups, one would expect a comparatively broader distribution of deaths as well and a general reflection of sex differentials in age at death. On the other hand, the foreignborn Jews living in Rhode Island are largely the "survivors" of a group who arrived in the state in the early decades of the twentieth century. Therefore, deaths to the foreign-born in 1979-81 are necessarily concentrated in the older ages. Such concentration is likely to lessen sex differential mortality. As the foreign-born become an increasingly smaller segment of the total Jewish population, the age distribution of Jewish deaths can be expected to resemble that of the total white population much more closely, among whom a relatively smaller proportion are foreign born.
Socioeconomic status.--Socioeconomic status (SES) has an important bearing on health in general and on access to medical care (cf. Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973, pp. 87-110), and there-

fore on patterns of mortality. In the absence of any single comprehensive index of socioeconomic status, education and/ or occupation are often used as indicators, although the shortcomings of these measures are recognized (Therriault and Logrillo, 1982). The present study had to rely on current or usual occupation as the sole indicator of SES, because the Rhode Island death certificate does not contain information on the educational achievement of decedents.
Information recorded on death certificates about occupation and, to a lesser extent, labor force status, may be of variable accuracy for a number of reasons. Problems arise primarily because the information is provided by relatives or acquaintances rather than the individual concerned, and these informants may not be entirely certain of the usual occupation of the decedent or of labor force status. Additionally, the information on occupation may be gathered in terms of either usual occupation or occupation at time of death; the latter may differ from usual occupation among older persons who have taken a second job after initial retirement. Assessment of this situation was undertaken using data from a sample of the total Rhode Island population (Gute and Fulton, 1982; Fulton and Gute, 1983), which compared the information on the broad census categories of occupation recorded on death certificates with that gathered from a sample survey and that contained in city directories. The results indicated disagreement between the death certificate occupation and that from other sources for about one-third of the men. For women, the discrepancies were much higher when an occupation other than "housewife" was listed, but the listing of "housewife" per se appears to be a good indicator of lifetime

occupational activity. Assuming these limitations apply equally to the death certificate information for Jews, they preclude any definitive assessment of the effect of occupational differentials, and of SES as indicated by occupation on mortality levels. Nonetheless, some broad patterns may be identified.
Of the 379 male decedents, only onefourth were employed at the time of their death. Most of the remainder had been retired. Among the women decedents, two-thirds were identified as homemakers at time of death, onefourth as being retired, and only 5 per cent as being in the labor force. These patterns are not surprising in view of the age distribution at death. They do, however, mean that information on occupation can be only suggestive, at best.
A number of studies have documented that American Jews in the midtwentieth century are overwhelmingly employed in white-collar positions (Goldstein, 1981, pp. 51-56), and that within the broad white-collar category, large proportions are professionals or managers/proprietors. These occupational concentrations are reflected in the

data on the Jewish decedents. Only 15 per cent of the male decedents were reported to have been employed in bluecollar work; an almost equal percentage had been professionals, and almost half were identified as managers or proprietors. Of the women decedents with a listed occupation, a similarly low percentage had been in blue collar jobs (18 per cent), and the largest percentage (44 per cent) had held clerical or sales positions. A much smaller percentage (26.5 per cent) of women than men had been managers or proprietors, and 12 per cent were identified as professionals. A number of the 238 women with no occupation listed may also at some time in their lives have been in the labor force, most probably as lower white-collar or blue collar employees.
In order to obtain some insights into possible differentials in mortality by socioeconomic status, decedents were classified as either higher (professionals, managers, proprietors) or lower (all other occupations) SES (Table 3). Among the males, a slightly larger percentage of higher SES men died at ages 65-74 and at age 85 and over than was

Use of all the information provided on the death certificate would, of course, provide a more complete view of mortality causes, but the underlying cause is the one used in this study to allow comparisons between the Jewish and total white populations.

In general, these cause-of-death patterns characterize the total white male decedents as well, although the levels vary somewhat. The only significant differences in cause of death between the two male groups are the elevated percentage of Jews reported as dying from diabetes and the higher per cent of nonJews dying of respiratory ailments.
These differences are not readily explained by these data. Several factors may be operating. Since diabetes may to

The differentials in deaths from respiratory ailments may be linked to smoking and/or work conditions. A number of studies have found, for example, that the lower incidence of lung cancer among Jews is related to the fact that cigarette smoking is less frequent among Jews than Catholics or Protestants (e.g., Seidman, 1973; Herman and Enterline, 1973). On the other hand, although the proportions of deaths due to cancer and heart diseases appear very similar for the two groups, these rather general categories may mask important differences in types of cancer and heart disease.
In general, the major causes of death account for about the same percentage of Jewish female deaths as of males. However, cerebro-vascular deaths are relatively more important among women than men, while the reverse holds for deaths from diabetes. Deaths from respiratory diseases are also somewhat more prevalent among Jewish women than men. The patterns for Jewish women are remarkably similar to

those of total white women. Overall, therefore, these data suggest that there are important differences in cause of death between males and females and between Jewish males and total white males, but that Jewish females closely resemble total white females in distribution by cause of deaths.
Cause of death and socioeconomic status.--Although earlier analysis has indicated no sharp differences in distribution in age at death by socioeconomic status for males, and for females when homemakers are included, previous research on the general American population has suggested that SES status can be an important factor in determining cause of death (Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973). Because of the small number of cases available to this study, analysis of the relation between SES status and distribution of deaths by cause will be restricted to males, and even then, the findings can only be viewed as suggestive.
For males, the overall patterns for

the higher and lower SES groups are similar, and the differences narrow even more when the data are standardized for age (Table 6). The greatest absolute differences characterize deaths due to AMI and cancer; each cause accounted for a larger percentage of all deaths among high SES than among low SES males (for AMI, 25.0 vs. 21.8 per cent; for cancer, 25.3 vs. 22.2 per cent). Differences in distribution vary considerably more within specific age groups, although the 45-64 age group is notable for very little difference by SES status. Among older ages, distributions are quite variable but no consistent pattern appears to help explain the differentials for the two groups by age of death identified earlier (see Table 3). The differences between the two groups are especially pronounced among the oldest age category. It is possible that not only occupational (SES) differentials are operating here, but also foreign-born status. Older, lower SES males are more likely to have been born outside the United States than either higher SES older men or younger men regardless of SES status. The health background of the lower SES older men may therefore vary considerably from that of the other males and be an important factor in differentiating them by cause of death.
Causeof death and place of birth.-- Since the foreign-born may have been exposed to quite different health and living standards than the native-born, place of birth status may in itself be an important underlying variable in determining specific causes of death. For example, Russian-born (which would include a high percentage of Jews) have been shown to be at especially high risk for cardiovascular diseases and cancer of the gastrointestinal tract and at low risk for cancer of the reproductive tract

(Curtiss and Grahn, 1980: 494-495). Among Rhode Island Jews, age-specific cause-of-death patterns may also reflect differences in the place-of-birth status of persons in the various age groups.
When the data on cause of death are tabulated separately for the native-born and foreign-born, the age standardized data suggest that native-born men are somewhat more likely to die of AMI (23.9 per cent), cancer (25.4 per cent), and other heart diseases (25.2 per cent) than are the foreign-born (21.8, 20.0, and 21.7 per cent, respectively). Conversely, foreign-born males have a higher proportion of deaths caused by cerebro-vascular disorders and respiratory diseases. For no specific cause of death are the differences statistically significant. For women, the standardized data indicate a relatively higher percentage of deaths from cancer (22.6 per cent) and a lower percentage from respiratory ailments (2.1 per cent) among the native-born; 18.3 per cent of the foreign-born died of cancer and 6.7 per cent from respiratory diseases. The significantly higher percentage of foreign-born women who died of respiratory ailments may be the result of differences in smoking habits or differences in their environment. Many foreign-born spent their early years in small factories or sweat shops, which may have impaired their respiratory systems.
Deaths from specific types of cancer.--A number of studies (see Shiloh and Selavan, 1973) have found lower rates of lung cancer for Jews compared to non-Jews. By contrast, studies of differential rates of cancer of the genital organs have found few differences by religious groups. The data for Rhode Island allow some limited assessment of cause of death for cancer at specific sites

for the Jewish and total white population. The data for males when age is controlled show cancer of the digestive tract as a major cause-of-death site for both groups, accounting for just under one-third of all cancer. Equally important for total whites is cancer of the respiratory system, but this site is strikingly less important (only 21.8 per cent) for Jewish men. Conversely, Jews show somewhat higher percentages of cancer deaths involving the genital-urinary system (22.2 vs. 17.3 per cent), and of unspecified sites, but neither difference is significant. Among females, the percentages dying from cancer of the respiratory system are generally similar for Jews (8.0 per cent) and total whites (10.6 per cent), as are the percentages dying from cancer of the genital-urinary system (16.3 and 14.9 per cent) and from breast cancer (16.6 and 16.5 per cent). The most striking difference characterizes deaths from cancer of the digestive system. Jewish women have a considerably lower percentage of deaths from cancer at this site (28.4 per cent) than total whites (38.4 per cent).
The very large proportion of Jews (between 23 and 31per cent), males and females, for whom cancer site is unspecified is puzzling and makes comparison with the total group tentative, at best. One possible explanation may be that the good medical care generally utilized by Jews is able to control to some extent cancer at a specified site, and it is only once the cancer has metastesized to multiple organs that it causes death. Nonetheless, it is likely that some of the differences for specific sites are large enough and consistent enough across age groups to reflect actual conditions. The differences in respiratory cancer between the male groups, for example, are large and consistently in the same

direction--higher for total whites than Jews--in three of the four age groups over 45. Moreover, the differential in deaths due to respiratory cancer conforms to the overall pattern identified earlier (Table 5) that death from respiratory diseases is generally lower among Jewish men than among total white males.
Deaths from specific types ofcardiovascular diseases.--Unlike the differences between Jews and non-Jews found for deaths due to specific cancers, the patterns for the two groups for deaths from various kinds of cardiovascular diseases are very similar. The similarity is especially strong for males, with almost identical percentages of deaths from acute myocardial infarction for the two groups (43.5 vs. 44.1 percent), from old myocardial infarction (28.8 and 29.8 per cent), and from cerebro-vascular disorders (11.3 vs. 11.6 per cent). The patterns for women are slightly varied. Jewish women have a lower percentage of deaths from old myocardial infarctions (27.9 per cent) than total white women (32.1 per cent), but relatively more deaths from other cardiovascular diseases (19.0 and 16.7 per cent, respectively). Thesefindingscorrespond to the overall patterns of cause of death which also indicated close similarity between Jews and total whites in proportions dying of cardiovascular diseases. Apparently the factors--whether environmental or genetic--which contribute to differentials in the broad categories of cause of death as well as in specific types of cancer do not influence incidence of various kinds of heart diseases.

and ethnicity has been of some interest because patterns of living, attitudes toward health and medical care, and genetic factors may all be related to religious/ethnic group membership. Such analysis is difficult, however, because official vital records do not collect information on religion or ethnicity. Using information provided by a newspaper and institutions handling Jewish deaths, this study has been able to identify 735 deaths that occurred to Jewish residents of Rhode Island during 197981. Through matching with official death records, data were obtained on the characteristics of the deceased and on cause of death. Comparisons were therefore possible of Jewish and total white patterns of mortality and cause of death, controlling for age and sex, and analysis of differentials within the group of Jewish decedents, taking account of place of birth and occupation.
These data provide a unique opportunity to explore the patterns of death for a single religious group. Unfortunately, lack of information on the exact size and composition of the total Jewish population of Rhode Island generally precludes calculation of rates or of life table values. Comparisons with deaths in the total white population are therefore necessarily crude; differentials between the two groups are influenced by differentials in the age composition of the respective total populations. Standardization by age overcomes this limitation to some extent.
Consistent with previous research, the current study indicates that a lower percentage of Jewish males die at ages below 65 and more at ages 85 and over than is true of the total white population. By contrast, Jewish females exhibit an age-at-death pattern similar to that of the general population, but with a

higher percentage of Jewish women dying between ages 75-84. These sex differences characterize cause-of-death patterns as well. Differences are more pronounced between Jewish and total white males, than between the female groups. Restricting the analysis to persons aged 45 and over, for Jewish men, as for total white males, heart diseases and cancer account for almost threefourths of all deaths. Among Jews, respiratory diseases and diabetes each account for 4 per cent of all deaths over age 45, and these percentages stand in sharp contrast to those for total white men. Jewish deaths from diabetes are significantly higher and from respiratory disease significantly lower than among total white men. Differences between the two groups also extend to sitespecific cancer deaths but not to specific types of cardiovascular diseases as causes of death. No such disparities in causes of death are found when Jewish females are compared to total white women, either in terms of general causes or for specific cancers and cardiovascular diseases.
A unique aspect of the data set being used here is the availability of information on the socioeconomic characteristics of a large number of the Jewish decedents. Particular focus was on place of birth (native-born/foreign-born) and socioeconomic status (high/low) as indicated by usual occupations, because both types of characteristics are associated with differences in life styles and therefore access to and utilization of health services. Analysis by place of birth suggests that observed differences in cause of death between native-born and foreign-born are largely a function of their very different patterns of age at death. Socioeconomic status (SES) showed no clear or strong relation to

The istics become more nearly alike is also data do suggest, however, that higher open to question.

The relatively few Jewish deaths available to this study has limited the scope of the analysis aswell as affecting the variability of the distributions. Nonetheless, the differences identified in age-specific patterns of death and in cause ofdeath indicate that religion and ethnicity continue to influence mortality. At thesame time, thepresent analysis suggests that in many respects, Jewish mortality very closely resembles that of non-Jews. Whether thesimilarity in mortality patterns is the result ofconvergence over the last several decades cannot, however, be determined with
