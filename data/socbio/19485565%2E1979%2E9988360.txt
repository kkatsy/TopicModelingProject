ABSTRACT: Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory scores, obtained on a sample of 154 black and 190 white same-sex twin pairs attending Philadelphia area schools, are analyzed to determine the effect of skin color on self-esteem. Skin color alone, and therefore race which is highly correlated with skin color, has no effect upon self-esteem.

In a previous paper we analyzed the genetic and environmental determinants of variation in skin color (Post and Rao, 1977). Here we report on the effect of skin color on self-esteem. The use of the Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory (Coopersmith, 1967) and the photo-electric measurement of skin color, as part of the Philadelphia Twin Study, allow us to examine the effect of skin color on selfesteem.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The sample consists of 348 same-sex twin pairs ranging from 10 to IS years of age. Sixty monozygotic (MZ) and 94 dizygotic (DZ) are blacks and 104 MZ and 86 DZ are whites. Assignment of individuals to race is based on information supplied by the subjects and their appearance with respect to skin color, hair form, and various facial features. Zygosity was determined by allotyping 19 red-cell antigen, serum protein, and erythrocyte enzyme polymorphisms.
Skin reflectance was measured either with a Model 610 or a Model 670 Photovolt reflection meter. The two instruments were checked against each other and found to give identical readings. The filters used were standard plain glass

Corning filters, blue (CSS-6O/S543), green (CS4-64/4010), and red (CS-59/2404), measuring 2.0, 3.0, and '4.0 mm thick, respectively. Measurements were taken on (1) the forehead over the glabella, (2) the flexor surface of the forearm approximately midway between the wrist and ulnar-humeral joint, and (3) the medial aspect of the upper arm just distal to the axilla. All areas were cleansed at least one hour prior to measurement with cotton and isopropyl rubbing alcohol. Additional details concerning instrumentation and measurement technique were given by Post et al. (1976).
The CSEI measures evaluative attitudes toward the self in social, academic, family, and personal areas of experience. The subject answers fifty short statements (Form A), e.g., "I'm easy to like," by placing a check in either the "like me" or "unlike me" column alongside each statement. A total score is derived by adding the total number of positive responses for a maximum score of fifty. Each of the fifty statements comprising the CSEI total score are assigned to one and only one of four subscales, general self (CGS), social self-peer (CPS), home-parents (CH), or schoolacademic (CS). These are scored separately. A separate lie scale, consisting of

eight items interspersed among the other questions, assesses extreme socialized response sets. Socioeconomic status is based on parental income and census track data.
Analysis of the data was carried out using the computer programs MULREG, LIST, PHEIGEN, and COMVAR at the Population Genetics Laboratory, University of Hawaii (for descriptions, see Morton, 1974; Rao et al., 1974).
RESULTS
REDUCTION OF THE DATA

1977). Age and sex effects were removed by quadratic regression.
For each twin pair, the socioeconomic status was recorded as low (1) or high (2) which is defined here as an estimate of the environment common to the two members of a twin pair, called Index I. In this way we define five variables:
Xi = self-esteem (SE) of twin Xj = SE of co-twin X3 = index of their common environment X4 -- skin color phenotype of twin (an esti-
mate of the twin's skin color genotype) X5 - skin color of co-twin.

Low lie scores gave no evidence that the subjects were giving socially conforming or acceptable responses, giving us confidence that honest answers were given to the remaining fifty questions.
A 4 X 4 matrix of correlations between the four subscales of the CSEI total score yields the first eigen value, 3.104. Selfesteem (SE) is here defined as the first principal component of the scores of these four variables. (SE) = (0.5S9)(CG5) + (0A90)(CH) + (0.474)(CP5) + (O.472)(CS) where the numerical constants constitute the first eigen vector of the correlation matrix. All the individual variables get nearly equal weights. The weighted score, SE, explains 78 per cent of the total variability in the data.
The first principal component of the nine skin reflectance measures is defined as the skin color phenotype (Post and Rao,

Observed correlations between these five variables are shown in Table 1, which will be analyzed according to the path analysis model described below.
MODEL AND ANALYSIS
The path analytic model is described in Figure 1, which is a simplified combination of Figures 1 and 5 of Rao et al. (1974). Underlying assumptions are: (1) Relationships between all pairs of the five observed variables are linear, and the effects of genotype, common environment, and skin color are additive (and hence dominance and other interactions are negligible); and (2) genotype and common environment are uncorrelated.
Expected correlations between the five (observed) variables are presented in Table 2 and are functions of seven parameters (see Figure 1):

FIG. 1.--Path diagram for twin correlations. The residual paths that do not contribute to twin correlations are not shown here, n = V(l + w)l2. For MZ twins: w* = I, h* -- h, and C = genotype of the twin pair. For DZ twins: w* = n2, h* -- k/2 and G = midparent genotype.

h -- effect of genotype on SE (square root of heritability)
c = effect of common environment on SE i ~ path from common environment to its
index (a measure of adequacy of the index)
q = effect of skin color genotype on SE t = effect of skin color genotype on skin
color phenotype (square root of heritability for skin color phenotype) w = correlation between parental skin color genotypes p = correlation between midparent skin color genotype and common environment.

Estimation of the parameters and tests of relevant hypotheses are carried out using the approach of Rao et al. (1974) which is briefly outlined here. Under our model there are only eight observed correlations having different expectations (see Table 2). Multiple observed correlations having the same expectation are pooled into one estimate. Let zt and £< denote the z-transforms of the £th observed and expected correlations (z< is bias-corrected).

Finally, an examination of the underly-

ing assumptions would be instructive. The

assumption of linearity is perhaps most pertinent to skin color and self-esteem.

where nt = numbers of pairs of observations used in computing the tth correlation, and x2 follows a chi-square distribu-
tion on 8~k d.f. when k parameters are
estimated. Parameters are estimated by minimizing x2, and the residual x2 is used to test hypotheses. X2H0 ~ X2Ht yields a likelihood-ratio-test for testing the null
hypothesis Ho against the alternative hypothesis Hi.

Regression of SE on skin color yielded nonsignificant quadratic terms (F-value on 1 and 718 d.f. = 0.87). The concept of dominance for polygenes has been questioned (Morton, 1974) and, if significant, would tend to elevate heritability in this material. As for gene-environment covariance, excellent fit of the general model leaves no evidence in favor of it. Finally, it should be noted that the various correlation estimates are assumed to be
