ABSTRACT: A simple version of Easterlin's relative-cohort-size model of fertility is presented and used to forecast fertility. The model tracks postwar U.S. experience closely and predicts an upturn in fertility in the 1980's. To illustrate the model's long-run properties, births are forecast to the year 2070. The forecast shows pronounced every-other generation cycles in births suggesting that, unless conditions change, concern with the economic consequences of declining population growth and crises in education and the youth labor market may be recurring features of the U.S. system.

In the 1930's and early 1940's a declining fertility rate led economists to speculate on the economic and social consequences of declining population growth. Keynes (1937) was concerned that the Malthusian evil might be exchanged for "the devil of unemployment escaping through the breakdown of effective demand." Glass (1937) and Spengler (1941) were concerned about the impacts of declining numbers on the demand for goods and services and economic efficiency. Spengler foresaw potential problems for the regional and occupational distribution of labor, unemployment, and changes in "the character of fundamental economic and politico-economic decisions and decision making" as the age composition of the working population changed.
The declining fertility rate of the 1960's and 1970's and the forecast of continued decline (Butz and Ward, 1979) has been accompanied by the expression of many of the concerns of the 1930's and 1940's. A book edited by Espenshade and Serow (1978) focused on the economic consequences of declining population growth and Spengler (1975)

readdressed many of the issues he had discussed over thirty years before.
The rising fertility rates of the 1940's and 1950's allayed fears of a long-run decline in population growth and its associated economic consequences. Will the more recent expression of these concerns also be quieted by rising fertility rates?
The work of Butz and Ward (1979, 1980) and Westoff (1978) would seem to indicate not. However, work by Easterlin, Wachter, and Wachter (1977, 1978), Wachter (1975), and Lee (1976) indicates the potential for a rising fertility rate in the coming decade. In the first section of this paper, the EasterlinWachter-Wachter fertility model and its recent formalization by Samuelson is outlined; the second section reports the estimation of the model, its forecast for the 1980's, and the long-run forecasts of the model through the year 2070. The implications of the study are discussed in the last section.

U.S. population swings in which "prior to the period dating roughly from the close of the Second World War, a movement in the rate of population growth was initiated by a movement in aggregate demand, but did not itself initiate a movement in aggregate demand and, in the absence of swings in aggregate demand, population growth would have been fairly steady." That is to say, population growth would have assumed a Lotka stable-growth path. However, in the postwar period a new relation between economic and demographic swings arose. Countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy dampened aggregate demand shocks while restrictive immigration and the incipient decline of the farm population shrank the traditional sources of reserve labor. Thus, the rate of natural increase now determined, with a lag, the working-age population and to a large extent the domestic labor supply. With damped aggregate demand fluctuations, the age structure of the working age population determined relative income (the income of young workers relative to their expected income) and this, in turn, determined fertility. Given the general equilibrium nature of the analysis, one may solve out the economic variables to derive a closed demographic model which would generate every other generation cycles in births, so-called "new" Kuznets cycles, rather than a smooth path for population growth.

This model is an elaboration of the earlier Easterlin relative-income model of fertility (Easterlin, 1961,1968,1973). In a recent paper Samuelson (1976) formalized the Easterlin model. Following Samuelson, the main elements of the model may be specified as follows. Let there be two age groups: Ni(t), the number of persons in the prime childbearing

In the first paper fertility is modeled as a function of cohort size relative to some equilibrium size, rather than relative to some previous cohort as in the present model. Lee applies the model to U.S. data 1917-1972 and identifies a cycle with a period of 38 years. In the second paper. Lee considers an age-structured population subject to serially correlated random vital rates. Lee applies this model to the U.S. time series with mixed results.

The cohort size variable B* is highly significant while the variable Bt_^ is almost significant at the 0.1 level. The model tracks the U.S. time series very closely, as shown in Figure 1. The forecast is presented in Table 1 along with a translation of the total birth forecast into a corresponding forecast for the general fertility rate.
The model predicts a further decline in the fertility rate in 1979, but a rise in total live births, reflecting an increase in the number of women in the prime childbearing years. From 1980 until 1987 there is a substantial rise in both the fertility rate and total live births, although slight reversals occur in 1984 and 1985. By 1987 the general fertility rate is predicted to be 17 per cent above its

1978 level, while total live births are 31 per cent above the 1978 figure. Thus, the fertility rate is predicted to reach a level similar to that of the early 1970's, while the number of total live births is predicted to reach levels comparable to those attained at the peak of the postwar baby boom. In sum, we predict a level of fertility significantly higher than that experienced in the recent past and a "boom" in total live births, which is a product of this higher level of fertility and an increase in the number of women in the prime childbearing years of 15 to 44.
It seems that the simple version of the closed model derived by Samuelson not only tracks the U.S. experience well but also predicts a revival of fertility and

dates this revival as commencing in the early 1980's. This forecast is in direct contrast to the predictions of the "new household economics" model of Butz and Ward (1979, 1980), who conclude, "we look for a continuing secular fertility decline toward some asymptote punctuated by countercyclical fertility movements,"3 and also contrasts with the predictions of Westoff (1978). However, the forecasts of this model agree with those of Wachter (1975) and Lee (1976) who stated, "current U. S. fertility is only temporarily low, and an upturn should occur after five or ten years."
LONG-RUN FORECASTS
While the model has been used to explain the pattern of births in the postwar period and produce short-run forecasts, it may also be used to illustrate that, by "a 'continuance' of what has been going on [government sustained growth in labor demand and restricted immigration] and without any 'violent or unnatural

pose here is not to produce a confident prediction of the future but to "instill skepticism about other people's confident predictions [of a continuation of the recent decline in fertility]" (Hajnal, 1955, p. 316).
Equation 2 was used to forecast total births out to the year 2070, that is, almost one hundred years beyond the estimation period. The path of total births may be summarized by dating the peaks and troughs generated as shown in Table 2.
As can be seen from this data, the model forecasts cycles of approximately forty years in length, consistent with the underlying model.4 The numerical analysis indicates a rising trend in fertility and a decrease in the amplitude of the cycles. The former is consistent with an upward trend in relative income and the latter with a decreasing incompatibility between childbearing and market work. The behavior of this model in the future closely resembles the path to

equilibrium predicted by Lee for his age-structured fertility model subject to environmental constraint (Lee, 1974a).
Thus, if the conditions which prevailed in the postwar period continue into the future, fertility in the U.S. will exhibit cycles rather than a decline to some new low level. However, what will happen if conditions are different? If the government does not continue to maintain a high and growing demand for labor by active monetary and fiscal policy and/or if it relaxes its restrictive immigration policy, then the fundamental causes of the forty year cycles in fertility will cease to exist and the " 'new' Kuznets cycle will join the old as a historical curiosity" (Easterlin, 1980, p. 144).
The cycles in fertility will damp down if sex roles change significantly and if the labor force participation rate of young females continues to rise. Westoff (1978) predicts a change in roles whereas Easterlin (1980) is skeptical of any significant change. The damping influence of rising participation rates may be reduced by growth in childcare facilities, maternity leave, and part-time employment.
A decline in the relative prosperity of smaller cohorts will also decrease the trend and amplitude of cycles in fertility. For example, the relative economic position of the current baby-bust generation may be reduced by an increase in the rate of illegal immigration, the downgrading of baby-boom generation labor, and the increase in the average age of retirement. Of these possibilities, illegal immigration seems to pose the greatest threat. Current studies of laborsubstitution show relatively limited substitution possibilities between workers aged 14-24 years and 25-54 years (An-

derson 1977). Substitution is higher between young workers and workers over 55 years of age, but the baby-boom generation will not be of this age when the baby-bust generation enters the labor market.
IMPLICATIONS
The relative-cohort-size fertility model presented in this paper predicts that U.S. fertility will rise throughout the 1980's. This prediction is in marked contrast to those offered recently by Westoff (1978) and Butz and Ward (1979, 1980). If this upswing in fertility persists, as the model suggests it will, recently expressed concern about the economic consequences of a declining population will be allayed. Also the future of "youth"-based industries--especially education--may not be as bleak as is commonly thought.
Illustrative long-run forecasts from the model suggest that the time path of U.S. fertility displays cycles of approximately forty years in length. These cycles produce cycles in the age-structure of the labor force and suggest that if certain characteristics of the U. S. economy and society remain unchanged, concern about the consequences of declining population growth, crises in education and other "youth"-based industries, and the adverse labor market experience of the young may be recurring features of the U.S. system.5
