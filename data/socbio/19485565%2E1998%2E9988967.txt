ABSTRACT: The low utilization of family planning methods in Ghana, and by inference in much of Africa, is explained by reference to traditional sociocultural values held by males. A LISREL model is tested using data collected from educated males working in the Ghanaian government. Among the findings are that lack of couple communication, segregated conjugal role relationships, and male-dominated decision-making are all significant predictors of non-use of family planning methods (pronatalist attitude is not). Possession of knowledge of family planning among Ghanaian males alone is unlikely to initiate use of family planning methods. Additional sociodemographic and modernization findings are reported.

Contraceptive use among both males and females in African countries has been very low (Dow et al., 1986; Khalifa, 1988; Larson, 1980; Mbizvo and Adamchak, 1991; Adamchak and Mbizvo, 1990; Wawer et al., 1991). While many studies (c.f., Bulatao et al., 1983a, 1983&; Kasarda et al., 1986) have investigated factors contributing to low contraceptive use among African women, there has been little or no systematic study of contraceptive use and knowledge among African men (Omondi-Odhiambo, 1997; Speizer, 1995; Adamchak and Mbizvo, 1991). Thus, debate continues about the extent to which men's attitudes toward family planning methods influence their own or spousal acceptance and use of contraceptives.
The purpose of this study is to address this knowledge gap and to attempt to establish the core factors responsible for the overall failure of family planning programs in African countries in general, and Ghana specifically. It is the thesis of this study that the low utilization of family planning methods in Ghana can be ex-

plained by reference to traditional sociocultural values held by males.
An investigation of male contraceptive behavior in Ghana is important. First, males' personal attitudes and opinions about family planning impact spousal acceptance and use of birth control (Speizer, 1995; Kannae and Pendleton, 1994). Second, heads of households and government bureaucracies in Ghana are males; thus, knowledge of male attitudes would provide information needed to formulate appropriate family planning programs. The results of the study can then be used to assess family planning desires and needs of Ghanaian males.
BACKGROUND
FAMILY PLANNING IN AFRICAN COUNTRIES
Family planning programs have been an integral part of national development plans in Africa since the early 1970's (Caldwell, 1995; The Population Institute, 1988; Centre National de Sante Familiale

and Columbia University, 1987; Central Statistical Office, 1989; Population Crisis Committee, 1990). For example, as early as 1969 Ghana had drawn up a national development plan that established specific policies to address population problems (Heckel, 1986). By 1986, 13 subSaharan countries (including Ghana) had established explicit population policies aimed at reducing or stabilizing fertility rates, primarily through family planning and birth spacing (Heckel, 1986). SubSaharan Africa has a current population growth rate of about 2.9 per cent, the highest in the world (Population Reference Bureau, 1996; Caldwell, 1995). Ghana's current growth rate is 3.0 per cent (Population Reference Bureau, 1996).
Despite attempts to integrate family planning programs in national development plans, current use of contraceptives in West Africa ranges between 10 and 20 per cent (Ghana Statistical Service, 1995; Caldwell, 1995; World Fertility Survey, 1983; Wawer et al., 1991). Fifteen subSaharan African countries have total prevalence rates over 10 per cent, and 7 have modern prevalence rates over 10 per cent. The 1993 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (Ghana Statistical Service, 1995) reports that about 91 per cent of currently married women have knowledge of modern contraceptives, but only 32 per cent have ever used a modern method and only 10 per cent are currently using (see also National Census Office, 1984; Cohen, 1993). Martin (1995) concludes that only 5 per cent of currently married women in Ghana are using modern methods of contraception, and the Population Reference Bureau (1996) reports 10 per cent. Jolly and Gribble (1993), after extensive analyses, concluded for Ghana that "contraceptive use

made the smallest contribution to limiting fertility of any of the proximate determinants" (p. 100).
THE FAILURE OF AFRICAN
FAMILY PLANNING
Contraceptive knowledge and use, and fertility decision-making, often vary by economic, social, and demographic characteristics (e.g., Ghana Statistical Service, 1995; Renne, 1993). Such variations help provide a conceptual understanding, at the macro level, regarding the success or failure of family planning programs. Lack of adequate financing for family planning programs in sub-Saharan Africa, where annual per capita expenditures for family planning programs are below $0.20, is often cited as a major reason for low national prevalence rates (Wawer et al., 1991, 1990; Ross et al., 1988; see also Carael and Stanbury, 1983; Repetto, 1972). Caldwell (1995), however, concludes that sociocultural values seem to play an even greater role than financing. Most studies have concentrated on asking women in African countries whether they approve or use family planning methods but failed to realize that even if the women want to use contraceptives, they cannot use them because their husbands tell them not to.
Much of the failure of family planning programs in African countries can be traced to the incorrect assumption that "birth planning behavior" is exclusively within the decision domain of women (Mott and Mott, 1985). Mbizvo and Adamchak (1991) note that one of the major limitations facing African-based family planning promotion programs and population policy is that they neglect men when probing the circumstances that govern a couple's contraceptive behavior (see

also Renne, 1993; Okediji, 1968). A study by Wawer et al. (1991) revealed that both males and females in the baseline surveys perceived that members of the opposite sex were interested in having more children and had little desire to use family planning (see also World Bank, 1986; Van de Walle and Traore, 1986).
Wawer et al. (1990) report significant differences between male and female desires for additional children in Senegal, Niamey, Burkina Faso, and the Sudan. While 9-13 per cent of male respondents report wanting no additional children, 18-22 per cent of the females said they do not want additional children. This sex difference relating to childbearing could play a significant role in determining the use of contraceptive methods among African societies. Cohen (1993), in his extensive review of sub-Saharan African fertility, noted that while contraceptive use may be increasing, it may be the result of desire to space children, rather than limit family size.
WHY MEN SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
The current study argues that male traditional values relating to marriage and family must be considered when investigating contraceptive practices in African countries, partly because most African nations are primarily patrilineal and male-dominated societies (Peil, 1972; Brown, 1981; Bhatia, 1978; see also Speizer, 1995). The opinion of the husband in African societies carries more weight than that of the wife in decisionmaking, especially in matters of family planning. Hence, a majority of wives do not have control over their fertility. Reproductive decisions are primarily made by males, and male approval must precede any consideration of the use of con-

traceptives in most African societies, including Ghana (Omondi-Odhiambo, 1997; Speizer, 1995; Kar and Talbot, 1980; McGinn et al., 1989; Khalifa, 1988; Hosken, 1984; Caldwell, 1970, 1974; Ware, 1975; Arowolo, 1976; Ndhlovu et al., 1986; Boohene and Dow, 1987; Dow and Werner, 1983; Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council and Westinghouse Public Applied Systems, 1985; Goldman and Pebley, 1989). Studies report that many women are knowledgeable about contraceptives and wish to use them, but cannot because their husbands would not give prior permission because of a desire for more children or more male children (Adamchak and Adebayo, 1987; Mustafa and Mumford, 1984; Population Reference Bureau, 1990a, 1990&, 1990<£; Adetunji, 1995).
Caldwell (1995) refers to a particular part of West African social structure fostering continued high fertility and low prevalence of contraceptives (p. 26):
. . . the major support for high fertility . . . has been a division between those responsible for fertility decisions and those who bear the greater share of the economic burden. . . . reproductive decisions are a matter for the husband and his family of origin.
Renne (1993), acknowledging the complexity of male dominance in reproductive decision-making, finds that increases in schooling for women and greater availability of contraceptives for Nigerian women may lead to changing reproductive desires. Oni and McCarthy (1986) found that the high demand for children clearly constituted an obstacle to increased contraceptive use for the purpose of limiting fertility. However, Martin's (1995), review of health and demographic surveys for 26 countries found that Ghana is one of the few to display relatively small differentials

in the use of modern contraceptives by education. A recent survey of educated government-employed males in Ghana confirms male expectations to control the fertility behavior of wives (Kannae and Pendleton, 1994).
It is explicit from the literature reviewed that one characteristic that has distinguished families of a number of African countries, including Ghana, is the relative lack of egalitarianism in the marital relationship (Goode, 1963; see also Omondi-Odhiambo, 1997; Pitts et al., 1995; Assimeng, 1981; Bhatia, 1978; Mason and Taj, 1987). The traditional patriarchal norms embodied in the extended family system emphasize male dominance in decision-making. The power to make decisions is not subject to bargaining or negotiation between husband and wife as is the case in Western societies (Scanzoni, 1978; see also Lesthaeghe, 1989).
Theoretically, the adoption of family planning should be the result of mutual agreement between the couple. That is not, however, the case for many African countries. The male has disproportionate control over the decision to have children, and traditional values for many African countries, including Ghana, place a high premium on prolific childbearing (Goldman and Pebley, 1989). Males generally tend to have a pronatalist attitude toward prolific childbearing or large family size. There is little that the woman can do to prevent having additional children if the man desires to have more, and the issue of whether to have children is rarely discussed between spouses in African societies.
Coupled with the lack of spousal communication on childbearing matters is the definition of conjugal role relationship according to gender. Men have specified roles to perform that are different from

those of women. Thus, male attitudes constitute a major facilitating or inhibiting factor in female contraceptive use. In Kenya, for example, even though most husbands know of modern contraceptive methods, 36 per cent had not discussed family planning with their spouses during the preceding year (National Council for Population and Development, 1989; Omondi-Odhiambo, 1997).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
THEORETICAL MODE
Drawing from the preceding literature review, four traditional male familial values relating to marriage and family that affect the practice of family planning can be distinguished: male-dominated decisionmaking power, pronatalist attitude, lack of couple communication, and segregated conjugal-role relationship. As noted earlier, the norm among African communities is for the male to be the head of the household, which confers on him the prerogative power over decision-making, including those about reproductive matters. Coupled with male dominance is the strong male commitment to having a large number of children (i.e., pronatalist). The traditional concept is that a family is never too large. Implicit in this view is also the idea that no community's population is ever considered to be too large in relation to its economic resources. The concept of overpopulation therefore becomes unacceptable to traditional African males. Belief in polygyny and the strong preference for having sons contribute to the desire for large family size.
Stemming logically from the male monopoly over decision-making is the lack of communication that occurs between spouses about the number and timing of

children (see for example Martin, 1995; Wawer et al., 1991; Kar andTalbot, 1980). It is the main contention of this study that the low utilization of family planning in Ghana can be explained in terms of the above four interrelated dimensions of familial traditional values relating to marriage and the family. Thus, deriving from the theoretical causal linkages established between these dimensions and the use of family planning, the following theoretical model (see Figure 1) is presented for empirical investigation. The concepts of modernity, kinship system, rural-urban residence, age, and religion, in addition to income and educational status, have been incorporated into the overall theoretical model as control variables.
For Ghanaian male government employees, the following hypotheses are postulated:
Hp There will be an inverse relationship between modernity and a male-dominated decision-making process.
H2: There will be an inverse relationship between modernity and a pronatalist attitude.
H3: There will be an inverse relationship between modernity and a lack of couple communication (i.e., more modern the attitudes, the greater the communication between the couple).
H4: There will be an inverse relationship between modernity and a segregated conjugal-role relationship.
H5: There will be a positive relationship between modernity and knowledge of family planning.
H6: Male-dominated couple decisionmaking power will be inversely related to the use of family planning methods.
H7: There will be an inverse relationship between a pronatalist attitude and the use of family planning.

H8: Lack of couple communication will be negatively related to the use of family planning methods.
H9: Segregated conjugal-role relationship will be negatively related to the use of family planning methods.
H10: There will be a positive relationship between knowledge of family planning methods and the use of family planning methods.
As indicated in the theoretical model (Figure 1), there are no hypothesized relationships among the latent variables of male-dominated decision-making power, pronatalist attitude, lack of couple communication, segregated conjugal-role relationship, and knowledge of family planning. It is argued that the male's childbearing decision-making does not affect his knowledge of family planning methods since the agents and organizations that disseminate family planning information are independent of individual families. Although the reverse relationships may be plausible, for methodological and theoretical reasons related to causal ordering of constructs (see James et al., 1986), the causal path between knowledge of family planning and decisionmaking power has been left out.
It may be argued that being pronatalist in attitude (i.e., having a desire for more children) could create less motivation in the individual to look for information on how to limit family size. However, the current study does not speculate about a relationship between desire for more children and knowledge of family planning since family planning program information is disseminated by various agents of government outside the control of individuals. Although communication between spouses and joint conjugal-role relationships could increase sharing of

knowledge about family planning, they may not necessarily be related because in Ghana family planning information is communicated to the public through the government controlled mass media.
A United Nations' report (1981) on factors related to the fertility rate in African countries indicates that ascribed characteristics, such as region, religion, ethnicity, and age in developing countries, appear to be more important predictors of fertility desires than characteristics associated with modernity, such as education, occupation of husband, and wife's labor force activity. Important as these ascribed variables may be to the current study, the focus is on male familial traditional values relating to marriage and the family and how they impact on the knowledge and use of family planning in Ghana. Nevertheless, ascribed characteristics such as kinship system, rural-urban residence, age, and religion, in addition to income and educational status, have been incorporated into the overall theoretical model as control variables. Yamanaka et al. (1982) have noted that background variables such as those used in the current model work better as controls through the concept of modernity, which explains why the model does not provide any paths between the background variables and the rest of the endogenous variables.
METHODS
Source of Data.--The data used in this study were obtained from a 1993 survey of male government employees' attitudes toward marriage, family, and the use of family planning in Ghana (Kannae, 1993; see also Kannae and Pendleton, 1994). Many of the items in the structured self-administered questionnaire were derived from previous instruments (e.g., World Fertility Surveys,

1983; Inkeles, 1966; Kahl, 1966,1968) that have been found to be valid and reliable.
The sample was randomly drawn from personnel in four Ghanaian government departments: Health, Agriculture, Education, and Administration. Questionnaires were distributed personally by the first author. Completed questionnaires were returned to the respective heads of departments and a series of personal follow-ups were made to collect the unreturned questionnaires. A total of 500 questionnaires were distributed in person by the first author to male employees of each of the four selected departments (125 in each department). A total of 484 completed questionnaires were returned, constituting a remarkably high response rate of 96.8 per cent.
Sociodemographic characteristics of the sample are displayed in Table 1. The sample is comprised of literate male workers who are primarily Catholic and have an average age of 39.5. The sample was not intended to be representative of the population, but to reflect individuals who are most likely to influence national policy.
MEASUREMENT OF VARIABLES
Thirteen latent variables are used in the current study (Figure 1). The six exogenous latent variables are: kinship (£j), education (£2), income (£3), residence (£4), age (£5), and religion (£6). The seven endogenous latent variables are: modernity (·n,), male-dominated decision-making process 0n2), pronatal attitude (T|3), lack of couple communication (T|4), segregated conjugal role relationship (iq5), knowledge of family planning (T|6), and use of family planning (T\7). A reliability coefficient of 0.65 or higher was used as the criterion for including latent variables with multiple indicators in the model.

deferred gratification, trust, preference for urban life, faith in science and technology, acceptance of change, belief in the efficacy of the individual in the structure of community, belief in the efficacy of the individual in occupational chances, low integration with relatives, and mass media participation. Each of the above indicators of modernity was derived as a composite of a number of other sub-indicators by Inkeles and Kahl (see also Gusfield, 1967). The current study used the sub-indicators as measures of modernity.
Respondents were asked five questions relating to modernity characteristics. They were asked to rate on a four-point scale

(1 being "strongly agree" and 4 being "strongly disagree") their feelings about the following statements: Man's success is decided at birth (MANSUCCE). One ought to think about the present (THINPRES). Doctors' discoveries do not help (DOCTDIS). Things should be kept the same (KEEPSAME). Old ways are better (OLDWAYS).
Male-Dominated Decision-Making Process (T)2).--Male-dominated decisionmaking process (MALEDECI) was measured by questions relating to whether the man, or both man and wife, should have a final say on matters affecting the family. Most of these questions were derived

Vol. 45, No. 1-2

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

from instruments used in previous studies to measure conjugal decision-making power (e.g., Blood, 1960; Fox, 1973; Gillespie, 1971; Hallenbeck, 1966; McDonald, 1980; Raven et al., 1975; Rosen, 1965).
Five questions were asked covering four main decision-making areas. The first two questions required the respondent to indicate whether he (MANIFICLO), or both spouses (BITFICLO), should have a final say in deciding the amount to spend on clothing. The three remaining questions asked whether both spouses should have a final say in deciding on the number of children to have (BOTFICHN), where the wife should work (BOTFIWRK), and who the wife can visit (BOTFIVIS).
A four-point response scale was used for all five questions (1 being "strongly disagree" and 4 being "strongly agree"). Four of the questions were reverse-coded so scores would read in the same direction, from low to high. The higher the score, the more male-dominated the decision-making process.
Pronatalist Attitude (T)3).--Pronatalist attitude (PRONATAL) was measured by asking respondents a number of fertilityrelated attitudinal questions. The questions were drawn from previous studies on population and fertility issues in subSaharan Africa (e.g., Caldwell, 1981). Respondents were asked their opinions regarding the following statements: Children are a blessing (CHNBLESS). Men should have as many children as possible (CHNPOSSI). Resources can stretch no matter the number of children a family has (STRETCH). Polygyny is an asset (POLYASET). A man should continue to have children until the desired proportionate number of sons and daughters is

achieved (PROPOCHN). A four-point scale (1 being "strongly agree" and 4 being "strongly disagree") was provided for each of five fertility-related statements. Four of the questions were reverse-coded to read in the same direction as the rest of the variables. The higher the score, the more pronatalistic the attitude of the respondents.
Lack of Couple Communication (T|4).-- Lack of couple communication (LACKCOMM) was measured by asking the respondents whether they discussed matters in general, including family planning with their spouses. Respondents were asked whether it was important for them and their spouses to understand how each other felt about things; and whether they talked about birth control or family planning with their spouses. The response categories used were "yes" and "no."
Segregated Conjugal-role Relationships (T|5).--The measure of segregated conjugal-role relationships (SEGROLE) was derived from Rainwater's (1965) topology of marital role relationships: jointrole relationships (measured by whether the respondent snared activities and tasks with the spouse) and segregated-role relationships (measured by whether the respondent emphasized formal division of labor and activities in the family).
Respondents were asked five questions about whose duty it is to perform a number of house chores: cooking meals; cleaning and dusting of the house; disciplining children; gardening and maintenance of the house; and managing money. The response categories were l="by the man," 2="by the woman," and 3="by both." The variables were recoded to collapse response categories " 1 " and "2" into one category based on the rationale that the two response categories

RESULTS
ESTIMATES OF THE MEASUREMENT AND
STRUCTURAL MODELS
The hypotheses embodied in the structural equation model (Figure 1) are tested using LISREL VII (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1990, 1988).1 Table 2 shows the standardized coefficients for lambda Y and X. The fairly high standardized coefficients are evidence that the latent constructs in the model are adequately measured.
Latent variables relationships are displayed in Table 3 as "gammas" (7s) and "betas" (Ps). These coefficients are comparable to traditional standardized multiple regression coefficients. The 7 s are parameter estimates for hypothesized relationships among the exogenous latent variables and the endogenous latent variables, while the f$s are estimates for the hypothesized relationships among the endogenous latent variables.
The statistical significance of the 7 s and Ps are determined by the /-value statistic, which is equal to the ratio of the
1The most important parameter estimates to be examined from the measurement model are the standardized coefficients for lambda Y and X. These coefficients are comparable to the factor loadings generated from a principal axis factor analysis. They measure the extent to which the indicants share a common variance with the theoretical latent variables. The higher the standardized coefficients, the stronger the contributions of the indicants to the theoretical (latent) variables.

coefficient to its standard error. Coefficients that are twice as large as their respective standard errors (i.e., f>2SEB) are considered statistically significant at alpha=0.05.
Hypothesis 1.--An inverse relationship was hypothesized between modernity and male-dominated decisionmaking process. The results (see Table 3) support this hypothesis with modernity having a significant negative impact O=--0.52) on male-dominated decisionmaking process. This finding suggests that as Ghanaian males become more modern, the less likely they are to be dominant in the conjugal decisionmaking process. The finding is consistent with Goode's (1963) assertion that modernization leads to the realignment of the conjugal power structure, thereby contributing to the average family becoming more egalitarian and democratic. The finding also corroborated Scott and Morghan's (1983) report that exposure to modern values exerts significant influences on traditional family expectations.
Hypothesis 2.--It was hypothesized there would be an inverse relationship between modernity and pronatalist attitude. Modernity (see Table 3) had a significant negative impact (($= --0.77) on pronatalist attitude, supporting Hypothesis 2. The finding suggests that the more modern the Ghanaian male becomes, the less likely he will be to have a large number of children or believe in prolific childbearing.
This finding is consistent with current literature relating modernity to traditional family values in African countries. It supports Entwisle and Casterline's (1989) finding that the rate of acceptance of family planning in rural Egypt varies inversely with the level of modernization. In other

words, the more rural the community, the greater the emphasis on having large numbers of children, or prolific childbearing.
Hypothesis 3.--An inverse relationship was hypothesized between modernity and lack of couple communication. The results (see Table 3) did indeed indicate that modernity has a significant negative effect (P=--0.87) on lack of couple communication. This result suggests that as Ghanaian males become more modern in their value orientations, the more likely they are to increase family planning communication with their spouses. This finding is consistent with Feldman's (1967) study which reported lower levels of communication between illiterate couples than literate couples in Ghana.
Hypothesis 4.--It was also hypothesized that there would be an inverse relationship between modernity and segregated conjugal-role relationship. The results (see Table 3) show a significant negative relationship (|3=-O.7O) between modernity and segregated conjugal-role relationships, supporting the hypothesis. The finding suggests that as Ghanaian males become more modern in their values, the less likely they are to divide conjugal roles on the basis of gender. This finding is consistent with Rainwater's (1965) finding that modern persons tend to have mutual relationships in marital interactions and encourage less segregation in role relationships within the family.
Hypothesis 5.--Hypothesis 5 predicted that there would be a positive relationship between modernity and knowledge of family planning. The results (see Table 3) showed that modernity has a significant positive effect ((3=0.42) on knowledge of family planning. Having control over one's future, coupled with

future orientation and recognition that change is inevitable reflect a "modernistic" orientation. Modernistic corollaries are desire for information, literacy, and media involvement through which an interest in social events is cultivated. Because the media is the main source through which the Ghanaian government disseminates population and family planning policies to the people, it is not surprising that "modern" people are more aware that something can be done to control family size.
Hypothesis 6.--An inverse relationship between the male-dominated decisionmaking process and use of family planning was hypothesized. The results indicated that a male-dominated decisionmaking process has a significant negative effect (P=-0.12) on the use of family planning methods. This fairly weak impact of the male-dominated decisionmaking process on the use of family planning may be explained by the fact that this study sample is literate, which has an influence on the way family decisions are made. Oppong (1970) found a positive association between syncratic power relationships and couples of similar education among a sample of Ghanaian civil servants.
A more traditional autocratic pattern (i.e., male-dominated) was found among couples with lower levels of education. Drawing from Oppong's findings, we might argue that a stronger negative relationship between male-dominated decision-making and use of family planning probably would have been found if the current study had incorporated the non-literate population in the sample. The finding is also consistent with the literature relating to conjugal decision-making power and family planning in African countries (e.g., Dow

128

et al., 1986; Kar and Talbot, 1980; Arowolo, 1976). These studies have all attested to the significant role that African male traditional values play in inhibiting the use of family planning methods among couples in Africa. Traditional patriarchal norms emphasize male dominance which tends to inhibit the use of family planning methods, even under circumstances where the women desire to use contraceptives.
Hypothesis 7.--It was hypothesized that a pronatalist attitude would be inversely related to the use of family planning methods. The results (see Table 3) indicated no relationship (P=-- 0.02) between a pronatalist attitude and the use of family planning. Several studies (e.g., Gadalla et al., 1985, 1980; see also Gadalla, 1978), have reported significant negative associations between the need for more children and the use of family planning. It is therefore surprising to find no relationship exists for this sample.
One would have expected a strong negative relationship between pronatalist attitude and use of family planning among Ghanaian males, given the fact that there is strong traditional emphasis on having large numbers of children. As reported by Adamchak and Adebayo (1985), the need for many children among African societies is so strong that older men tend to marry younger women to guarantee them many years of childbearing. The weak negative relationship may be explained in terms of this sample being literate, reflecting weaker traditional values relating to the number of children a family should have. As shown in Table 1, the mean number of children for this sample is only 3. Feldman (1967), for example, found significant differences between uneducated and educated couples in terms of their attitudes toward family planning and abortion in Ghana.

Hypothesis 8.--As anticipated, there was a very strong negative relationship (P=--0.61) between lack of couple communication and use of family planning among Ghanaian males. This result suggests that communication between couples is critical to the use of family planning methods in Ghana. The finding is consistent with Kar and Talbot's (1980) study which stressed the importance of conjugal power and communication in promoting or inhibiting contraceptive intentions. In their African surveys on knowledge, attitude, and practice of family planning, Wawer et al. (1991) found that husbands and wives rarely hold discussions with their spouses on family size, family planning, or related issues. In fact, three out of every five couples in Togo reported that they had not discussed family planning in the year prior to the survey (Population Reference Bureau, 1990*). Card (1978) also reported significant correlations between spousal communication and use of family planning in developing countries.
There is no doubt that limited communication between couples in many African countries not only limits the ability to talk about problems of a general nature, but also seriously limits the likelihood of adopting birth control measures. Spousal communication is particularly important because some family planning methods require consistency, careful application, and sometimes deferred gratification to achieve effective results.
Hypothesis 9.--It was hypothesized that there would be an inverse relationship between segregated conjugal-role relationship and use of family planning methods. The results (see Table 3) reveal a significant negative relationship ((J=-- 0.21)

Vol. 45, No. 1-2

Family Planning

between segregated conjugal-role relationship and the use of family planning. This finding provides support for Hypothesis 9 and corroborates Rainwater's (1966) finding that a segregated conjugalrole relationship limits the ability to control family size. Thus, one should expect greater success in family planning where spouses share household tasks than where roles are divided strictly on the basis of gender. Joint conjugal-role relationships afford spouses the opportunity to share ideas of personal concerns and seek consensual solutions for them.
Hypothesis 10.--Consistent with the literature, knowledge of contraceptives was not a good predictor of use; rather, male-dominated decision-making, pronatalist attitude, lack of couple communication, and segregated conjugal-role relationships proved to be better predictors.
In terms of the effects of the exogenous sociodemographic variables on modernity, only age, educational status, and income have significant impacts. Age has a significant negative effect (P=--0.16) on modernity. The relationship suggests that the older the respondent, the less likely he is to be modern. This finding may seem logical, since the older the respondent, the more likely he is to be a first generation literate and may therefore still cherish traditional values. There is a significant positive relationship ((3=0.26) between educational status and modernity. The relationship suggests that higher education is associated with higher modern values. This result should not be surprising since formal education in African countries is Western in content. The results also showed that income is significantly related ((3=0.22) to modernity. Thus, the higher the income, the more likely the respondent is to be modern in his value orientation.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, the study provides empirical support for most of the hypotheses that were embodied in the theoretical model. First, the results indicate strong significant negative relationships between modernity and the four dimensions of familial traditional values (i.e., male-dominated decisionmaking process, pronatalist attitude, lack of couple communication, and segregated conjugal-role relationships). These findings suggest that as Ghanaian males become more modern, the less likely they are to be dominant in the conjugal decisionmaking process, the less pronatalist they are in their attitudes, the more likely they are to communicate with their spouses, and the less likely they are to discharge household tasks separately.
Second, the results show that among the four dimensions of African traditional family values, lack of couple communication is the most significant predictor of non-use of family planning methods among Ghanaian males. Segregated conjugal-role relationships is the second strongest predictor of non-use, followed by male-dominated decision-making. The relationship between pronatalist attitude and contraceptive use is not statistically significant. The results further show that possession of knowledge of family planning among Ghanaian males alone is unlikely to initiate use of family planning methods.
Finally, the results also show that among the sociodemographic variables, age, educational status, and income are the only significant predictors of modernity.
In terms of the overall goodness of fit of the model, the various indices (e.g., squared multiple correlation [R2], goodness-of-fit index, root mean square

130

residual, chi-square statistic, Q-plot, modification index) (see Table 3) produced by LISREL provide sufficient support for the data having a good fit with the theoretical model.
IMPLICATIONS OF FINDINGS
There are several implications for the findings. They provide an additional approach that should be integrated into family planning programs in Ghana, and in other African countries, to enhance current approaches focusing on educating couples on the advantages of limiting family size as a way of gaining the population's acceptance and use of family planning.
Second, much as Omondi-Odhiambo (1997) found for Kenya, the study implies that there are several traditional familial values influencing fertility decisions that exert considerable pressure on Ghanaian males to want to have large families. This finding means that, as Speizer (1995), Renne (1993), and Caldwell (1995) all discuss, men's familial traditional values could exert significant impact on the success or failure of family planning programs, and perhaps governmental population policies. Unless the pressure exerted by these familial traditional values is changed or reduced, family planning programs in Ghana are unlikely to achieve significant results.
Closely related is that the study shows men to be important actors in fertility and family planning processes in Ghana. If family planning programs are to have any success in Ghana, then men must be considered active participants in the process of planning, designing, and implementing

birth planning policies. It is recommended that national programs aimed at controlling women's fertility in Ghana examine males' perspectives.
Finally, the findings are relevant to community-based and clinical programs that have as their goal the satisfaction of an existing unmet demand for family planning services, particularly in populations with moderate fertility desires on the part of the women and with opposition from the men. Having identified lack of spousal communication as the major obstacle to use of family planning in Ghana, community-based programs could set up focus groups of couples to initiate and encourage dialogue among couples on population policies and use of family planning, and life skills training could be promoted among teens. Communication skills training could become part of prenatal classes.
The major limitations in this study are methodological. First, the manner in which the sample was selected may limit the generalizability of the results to the general population. The sample was comprised of literate male workers who, while they are most likely to influence national policy, are atypical of the general population that is predominantly illiterate. Second, this population is disproportionally represented by Catholics whose religious beliefs do not subscribe to most of the modern forms of contraceptives. The unexpected lack of relationship between knowledge of family planning and use of family planning methods could be attributed to the comparably large number of Catholics in the sample of study.
