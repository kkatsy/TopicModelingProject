ABSTRACT: Reproductive time lost through marital dissolution is a potential factor in decreased fertility. This study of survey data from six Latin America metropolitan areas shows that, among variables examined, type of marital union is the primary determinant of reproductive time lost. The study establishes that appreciably more reproductive time is lost from consensual unions than from legal ones. It also indicates that this difference cannot be explained by such socialbackground characteristics as a woman's place of birth or educational attainment.

There is an apparent causal path leading from marital instability to reduced fertility: the more unstable the unions, the more time nonmarried after or between unions. The more time thus "lost from (legitimate) reproduction," the lower the fertility. Indeed, the time lost after and between unions was specifically enshrined two decades ago in the Davis-Blake list of variables intermediate between cultural factors and fertility (19S6).
The supposed fertility-depressing effect of reproductive time lost has been of especial interest in the study of those areas where marital instability is most prevalent. Thus, in studies of the Caribbean particularly, the intermediate variable of time lost through marital dissolution was used to explain observed relationships between type of marital union (visiting, consensual, or legal) and fertility (Blake, 1955; Blake, 1961; Braithwaite and Roberts, 1961; Cumper, 1966; Ebanks, 1973; Ibberson, 1956; Nag, 1971; Ram and Ebanks, 1973; Tekse, 1967; Stycos and Back, 1964). And indeed, students of population policy have speculated about the possibility of maintaining high levels of instability or even increasing them as a

means "beyond family planning" toward fertility reduction in societies with low effectiveness in birth control (Davis, 1967; Yaukey, 1973).
However, evidence has begun to accumulate that the potential negative impact of time lost from marriage on fertility can be confounded by other factors. There is a tendency for the losses of time due to marital dissolution to occur during the least fecund older female ages (Yaukey, 1973; Onaka and Yaukey, 1973). If marital dissolution and/or remarriage probabilities are selective on the basis of fecundity, then instability can result in attraction of fecund women to the married state, pushing fertility upward; or, of course, fecundity selectivity could work in the reverse direction (Yaukey, 1973). If there is a combination of effective birth control and low desired family size, then the same small desired family size can be achieved eventually by women, in spite of some time lost between unions, albeit with a later average age of childbearing (Yaukey, 1973). The start of a new union may even initiate a new round of childbearing with the new partner that would not have occurred with the former

number of interviews obtained ranged from 2,087 to 2,353 for each metropolitan area (Miró, 1966). For the present analysis, we purged these samples of the few professed non-Catholic women, of women born outside the country, and of women who had never entered either a legal or a consensual union. The remaining subsamples ranged in size from 1,176 to 1,781 women.

Because the comparative survey program was a pioneering effort, data have been subject to evaluation by a variety of analysts (Miró and Rath, 1965; Miró, 1966; Stycos, 1968; Hass, 1971; Duncan, 1972). A review of these assessments gives us some confidence in the validity of the responses in almost all cities, including the validity of responses about present and past marital statuses.

with respect to the question on use of specific birth control techniques, there is an unusually low incidence of use of the condom and withdrawal in Rio, a fact which to him suggests faulty interviewing (Stycos, 1968, p. 66). Although we will analyze the Rio data along with those from the other five cities, we counsel the reader to place more emphasis on the results from the other cities in drawing conclusions.

The potential negative effect on fertility of reproductive time lost due to marital instability is limited by the proportion of the fecund years since first marriage that women spent after or between unions.

did not record changes in the definition of particular unions. The most prevalent pattern of change, reportedly, is the redefinition of existing consensual unions as legal after some years. Although we have no direct evidence of the degree to which this pattern was followed, Table 2 leads us to suspect its presence. The percentage of women most recently in legal unions who mentioned any prior union is very low, ranging from l.S per cent to 5.3 per cent for the cities. In contrast, the percentage of women most recently in consensual unions admitting prior unions ranged from 22.2 per cent to 40.0 per cent.
If such a pattern of relabeling existing unions did exist, what would be the nature of its influence on the relationship between type of union and reproductive time lost? It probably would increase the difference between presently consensual and presently legal unions with respect to time lost, due to the following process. Consensual unions which seem durable to the partners are the ones most likely to be legalized; consensual unions appearing less durable will not be legalized. That is, apparent durability will become a determinant of whether a union will be labeled consensual or legal. From one point of view, this injects an element of circularity into any argument about type of union causing marital instability and in turn influencing reproductive time lost. From another point of view, one can argue that such a supposed pattern would not in any way contradict the conclusion that legalization of a union--whether at the outset or later on--represents a greater degree of commitment to durability than does entering a consensual union and promises less reproductive time lost.
SOCIAL BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS, TYPE OF UNION, AND REPRODUCTIVE TIME LOST
We use the general term "socialbackground characteristics" to refer to so-

cial positions occupied relatively early in women's lives, such as rural-urban community of childhood residence or socioeconomic status of family of orientation, which could have influenced women's adult life choices. The influence of such social-background factors could "explain" the observed relation between type of reproductive time lost to the degree that (1) the social-background characteristics were determinants of the degree of reproductive time lost, (2) the socialbackground factors were also determinants of the type of union entered, and (3) after controlling for these associations, there was less remaining association between type of union and reproductive time lost. In this section we will address those three topics in order.
The social-background characteristics we tested were (a) the woman's place of birth and (b) the woman's educational attainment. Place of birth is taken to represent the distinction between rural and urban upbringing. (Of course, rural birth in this sample also identifies a woman as a rural-to-urban internal migrant during her lifetime.) Educational attainment is taken to represent the socioeconomic status of the family from which she comes, as well as her own qualifications. Both rural-urban origin and socioeconomic background have been found to be related to fertility and marital patterns, both generally and in these cities in particular (CELADE and CFSC, 1972, Chap. 3; Yaukey and Thorsen, 1972). It is to be noted that the time referent for the distinctions being employed here (birth and completion of primary education) are prior to the likely entry into marital unions and thus could not be influenced by marital history. Thus, these two variables should supply good tests of the relationship between type of union and reproductive time lost.

percentages of reproductive time lost both by place of birth and by level of education attained. Age standardization was by the same method described in the preceding section, using the distribution of reproductive time susceptible to loss for the total population of all cities together as the standard. Women born in rural areas and women who had not completed primary education tended to have slightly greater percentages of time lost in each of the six cities. Although the differences between pairs of classes were consistent, they were not large, ranging from 1.0 to 5.2 percentage points for place of birth and from 0.2 to 6.0 percentage points for educational attainment. Not shown in this summary table is the fact that differences in the same direction were found separately for each five-year age interval with very few reversals.
Table 3 also presents the percentages of women whose last unions were consensual both by place of birth and by level of education attained. In all six cities, ruralborn women and women not having completed primary school had higher percentages of consensual unions. Differences

based on education tended to be larger than those based on rural-urban birthplace, ranging from 3.9 percentage points to 43.1. Both place of birth and educational attainment appear to be determinants of type of union entered.
Table 4 presents the percentages of reproductive time lost for categories of women in each city, cross-classified on the basis of women's place of birth, educational attainment, and type of union. To the degree that distribution of the social-background characteristics explains the differences between types of union in terms of the dependent variable, we would expect to see consensual vs. legal differences in percentage of reproductive time lost for the "total" row to shrink when subject to classification and cross-classification in lower rows. Generally, they do not shrink. The association between type of union and degree of reproductive time lost seems to withstand this test. (We will formalize the test further, below.)
Incidentally, the cross-classification also points out that place of birth and education influence the amount of repro-

ductive time lost regardless of type of marital union. Although the pattern among the metropolitan areas is not uniform, generally (1) women who do not complete primary school tend to lose more reproductive time than women who have completed primary school, and (2) women from rural areas lose more time then women from urban areas, regardless of the type of marital union they enter. The lack of uniform pattern of percentages of time lost by social-background characteristics indicates that these factors differ in their effect on the marital patterns in each of the metropolitan areas.
We have preliminary evidence that the associations (1) between social background and time lost and (2) between type of union and time lost are fairly independent of each other. This observation is formalized and made more precise in a component analysis summarized in Table 5 (Kitagawa, 1955 and 1964). The reading

attainment. This breaks down into: (second row) 16.2 per cent by place of birth separately; (third row) 3.7 per cent by educational attainment separately; and (fourth row) 5.3 per cent by the interaction between the two. By subtraction, we find that (fifth row) 74.8 per cent of the difference in reproductive time lost between women in consensual and legal unions remains unexplained by the operation of place of birth and educational attainment in Caracas.
It turns out that this residual-effect figure of 74.8 per cent for Caracas is the smallest for the six metropolitan areas except for Rio de Janeiro. At the other extreme is a residual of 119.7 per cent for Buenos Aires, meaning that place of birth and educational attainment actually had "masked" the effect of type of union to a minor degree. The figures for the three remaining cities all cluster around 95 per cent.

It seems safe to generalize that the impact of type of union upon reproductive time lost remains largely unexplained by these social background differences. Among the factors we have studied, the dominant determinant of reproductive time lost is type of marital union.

imum expectation at the beginning of the marriage would approach twenty-three completed years because of the truncation of the table. The figure at the top of the column at the far right (15.50 in our illustration) tells how many of those years, on the average, unions in this hypothetical cohort would last. It is this summary figure which is the main reason for the construction of the table. It is comparable for all marital-dissolution tables we constructed, since the same truncation of durations was employed in all. We shall call it the "index of durability" of the specified class of marital unions.
Table 7 presents the indexes of durabil-

years in Caracas to 8.4 years in Bogotá. This is, of course, consonant with our earlier finding of less reproductive time having been lost from legal unions in the five cities. It shows that the time-lost differential was not based solely on differences in delay of remarriage, but that differential risk of marital dissolution was at least a major factor.
Where consensual unions are on the average less durable, is this fact due to greater risk of widowhood, of divorce or separation, or both? The upper section of Table 8 presents indexes of durability by type of union and by cause of marital dissolution, voluntary (divorce or separa-

(4) thegreater the educational differences in reproductive time lost. All of these findings suggest that in high-consensuality cities, there is a tendency for thedistinction between legal and nonlegal unions to diminish and for the remaining differences in marital patterns to reflect more simply location in thesocial structure. Thishypothesis, based on five cases, is offered in the hope of future testing.
Finally, it seems appropriate to remind the reader that we have been dealing with only onesegment of an apparently complex set of causal paths leading from marriage to fertility. Suppose it be true that entering consensual unions leads to greater risk ofdivorce orseparation which inturn leads to greater reproductive time lost. That does not mean that consensual unions need tend to have lower fertility. It need not even mean that less durable unions need beassociated with less fertility, for(as elaborated in the introduction) many factors can confound that tendency.
This point is illustrated by comparable data on another metropolis in Latin America--Guayaquil, Ecuador. The analysis showed that voluntary marital

dissolution produced twopartially counterbalancing influences on fertility: (1) depression through loss of reproductive time and(2)inflation through starting of new childbearing cycles with newpartners (Chen et al., 1974).
It seems inretrospect that weand others have been burdened with a simplistic view of thepotential causal paths involved in relationships between marital stability and fertility. The apparent solution to that problem is to initiate studies based on detailed and exhaustive marital and reproductive histories (including data on women not currently married) and exploratory multivariate analysis.
