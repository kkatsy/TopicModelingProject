ABSTRACT: This paper considers the assumption that there are widespread sex differentials in the household allocation of food in South Asia. From primary field data and a critical review of the existing literature, it concludes that we have no reason to believe that girls in this region invariably get an unfair deal in the matter of nutrition, even in those areas where sex differentials in child mortality are the most acute. Too much of the research to support such a contention starts with the biased view that gender differences in nutritional status must exist. It is pointed out in this paper that a new look at this issue is essential if we are to use scarce resources most effectively to fight gender inequalities. By identifying more precisely the areas in which women are worst discriminated against, action to affect these areas can be focused much better than by spreading efforts into programs where the need is at best marginal.

In recent years, there has been a growing awareness that the household is not necessarily the best unit of analysis in social science research. This is because, just as there exist intrasocietal differences in various aspects of behavior and welfare, the household too is not homogeneous. Different members face very different opportunities and constraints depending on their status as denned by a range of characteristics. Indeed, so powerful has been this new awareness that we almost seem about to swing completely the other way, denying the existence of any kind of common family or household interests. While such a complete swing would again be self-defeating, this new focus on household members as separate individuals has still served an essential purpose in identifying more clearly the high-risk groups, that is, those most urgently in need of attention.

Gender is now held to be one important determinant of intrahousehold differentials in welfare. Age is the other factor most commonly considered, but on the whole it seems to be the case that differences by sex are more severe than those by age. Moreover, age differentials are less invidious in a sense because, at least in principle, all individuals go through the less favorable as well as the more favorable ages over their life cycle. Gender on the other hand is not a life cycle stage, and the disadvantages associated with it are faced only by one group.
Differentials by sex have been demonstrated to exist in access to several resources, ranging from those necessary for the leading of a full life to those necessary for survival itself. Inequality in the latter set of resources is particularly stark in South Asia, where sex differentials in mortality fly against all biological theories of sex-determined

hardiness (see, among others, Visaria, 1967; El Badry, 1969; D'Souza and Chen, 1980; Kynch and Sen, 1983). However, while mortality differentials can be measured relatively easily, there is less known about sex differentials in other aspects of physical wellbeing.
One of the factors related to physical welfare which has been regularly suggested in the literature is a gender differential in the intrahousehold allocation of food in cultures where women have a generally subordinate role. For example, UNICEF has a very potent photograph in its files. It depicts an Indian mother with two young children--one a bonny smiling boy and the other a wide-eyed girl ravaged by extreme malnutrition. So powerful is the visual impact of this photograph that it has been used by several private and official agencies in their attempts to influence the serious gender imbalance in the nutritional treatment of children which is believed to exist in much of South Asia.
But how representative is this picture? The answer to this question is important for two reasons. In the first place, we need to know where the focus of our attention should be in the attempt the redress the several gender inequalities which exist in the developing countries in general and the South Asian region in particular. Should we concentrate most on the relative nutritional deprivation of girls? Or on the inequality in their access to welfare services such as in health? Or on the rampant discrimination that they face in the labor market? Resources being limited, the more they are scattered, the less effective they will be. There is thus much to be gained at a practical

level by a greater confidence in the belief that girls invariably get the worse end of the nutritional stick.
Second, and as important, we need an answer to this question so that blame can be more fairly placed. The recipients of this blame are the parents (and, by extension, other household members) who are believed to acquiesce in, often even encourage, and perhaps themselves act out a day-today discrimination in the allocation of household resources to girls. While it is true that it is being increasingly recognized that household behavior is an important determinant of health (see, for example, Caldwell, 1979; Caldwell et al., 1983; Basu, 1987), such behavior has several manifestations and not all of them are equally relevant in different situations. Accusing the household of everyday and conscious denial of enough food to a female child is a serious charge which deserves greater support with actual evidence.
Discrimination in the use of health services is one thing. One can attribute less ulterior motives, such as a greater panic in a male child's illness or a greater cultural inhibition about having a girl examined by a male doctor, to the possibility of there being a callous disregard for the girl child's welfare (Basu, 1990). Similarly, when girls are kept out of school more often than boys, a kinder explanation can include the fears and insecurity felt about sending young girls to a faraway school. But in the case of food allocation, one runs out of such charitable excuses and must conclude instead that callousness toward girls and/or the self-interest of parents is/are such large considerations that they allow girls to be consistently underfed while their brothers gorge.

is this kind of reasoning that prompted Miller (1981) to conclude that "nutritional and medical deprivation go hand in hand with deprivation in love."
In this paper I therefore attempt a critical review of the evidence on the relatively greater nutritional deprivation of girls in South Asia. I examine both indirect and direct evidence and rely on both primary and secondary sources of data. My main finding is that this evidence is inconclusive at best and possibly even conclusive in a direction which suggests that, in access to food, daughters and sons do not really stand very different chances. This finding is not to imply, of course, that they face fairly equal chances in other aspects of life as well. We have too much very clear evidence, best embodied at one extreme in the sharp sex differential in child mortality in the region, of a large covert and overt gender inequality, especially in childhood.
It should be noted that in the Indian case I concentrate on the North-South dichotomy because the North is the region where the greatest nutritional differentials by sex have been expected (for example, Miller, 1981), given that overall gender inequality is greater in this region.
INDIRECT EVIDENCE
The literature abounds in this kind of evidence. The usual practice is to infer from the well-established sex differential in mortality, especially in childhood, that there must be and are corresponding sex differentials in feeding habits, especially in childhood.
But why should we accept this inference? Malnutrition is but one of the possible precursors to death and, if

recent research is to be believed, not nearly as important as originally thought. For example, I (Basu, 1989), concluded from a review of the available data that it is not necessary to use household discrimination in the allocation of food to explain sex differentials in child mortality in India. The case seems to be much stronger for household discrimination in the allocation of health care once an illness has struck. In the primary data employed in that paper, North Indian children were found to show marked differences in favor of boys in both mortality and health care, whereas in the case of nutritional levels, if anything, girls did somewhat better than boys.
Similarly, Aaby (1988), in a thesis which is gradually gaining acceptance, pleads that we return to "transmission" factors, as opposed to "host" factors, to explain differentials in the mortality risks faced by different groups from several infectious illnesses. In recent years, with the increased stress on nutritional status, factors such as overcrowding to explain illness severity have gone unnecessarily out of fashion. This variable can, for example, explain a substantial link between fertility and child mortality in poor populations. Historically, Wrigley (1969) would attribute the higher urban mortality during the Industrial Revolution in Europe to the population density increases associated with urbanization rather than to industrialization per se or to worse nutrition; for instance, the mortality in slums in large cities (which were more often commercial rather than industrial centers) was significantly higher than in industrial areas where people lived in relatively small villages and towns.

We also have some (though admittedly approximate) data on sex differ-

entials in actual food consumption. Since these data were obtained by the method of previous day's recall by the mother, it would be unwise to set too much store by them, but the overall impression seems to be that in the Uttar Pradesh sample, girls did have a slightly better diet than boys in the case

30

of some choice foods such as fruit and eggs (although they did somewhat worse on milk consumption), while for the Tamil sample, there was little to choose from between the sexes as far as food intake was concerned. Perhaps one should add that this picture is not the result of favoritism toward girls in the northern sample but probably reflects circumstances such as a greater presence at home, which increases the access of girls to food, especially to snacks.
Nonetheless, the researcher working with small intensive samples feels more secure if secondary data support (or at least do not contradict) the results obtained. I therefore now turn to a critical review of the existing knowledge in this area and conclude that the case in favor of the selective nutritional deprivation of girls is far from made.
To begin with the ethnographic literature, Miller (1981) did an extremely painstaking search of the literature in this context, so I think that we can assume that her evidence is the best that this literature has to offer. Her first conclusion is that the subject of sex differentials in feeding patterns has been virtually ignored by ethnographers. While this could indeed reflect a preoccupation with other topics by ethnographers, one wonders if the scant attention is at least partly because field researchers have found so little to report. One hopes that the anthropologist who sees consistent underfeeding of girls vis-a-vis boys in a society would find this topic sufficiently interesting to explore. I think that my argument here is similar to Miller's argument that since the anthropological literature on North India is replete with descriptions about the joy experienced at the birth

of a son while that on South India is not, this lack of descriptions means that such excessive joy is less present in the South.
The result is that although Miller (1981) devotes much more space to feeding differentials by sex than to differentials in health care, she is on much weaker ground in the former case. For example, the evidence on breastfeeding can affect both nutrition and mortality in either direction, depending on the circumstances. For instance, the (slightly) younger age at which girls have the annaprasanceremony (which marks the introduction of solid foods) in some parts of India could mean that there is a greater hurry to get them off the breast, but it must also be mentioned that this ceremony simply heralds the cessation of total breastfeeding while partial breastfeeding still continues. Its practical result may well be that girls now get a more balanced diet than boys. For example, in the Morinda study, Levinson (1972) found that in upper-caste households, fully weaned girls and semi-weaned boys showed little difference in total nutrient intake.
So many possible interpretations means that the mother suspected of discriminating against her daughters in food often faces a no-win situation (for example, see Pettigrew, 1986). If the daughter is breastfed longer than the son, it is because the mother (or parents, or grandmother) does not want to spend money on other food; if she is breastfed for a shorter while, it is because breastmilk is considered more important for boys.
Finally, the anthropological studies from South India which describe the fine food given to girls at menarche should really be treated more as the

observation of a ritual than overall preferential feeding of girls over boys.
There are other pitfalls in giving too much weight to such descriptive or anecdotal evidence, the main one being the problem of biased samples. This problem is well illustrated in Pettigrew (1986), where the author talks of the positive discrimination toward a son and the negative discrimination against the youngest daughter in a family with one son and four daughters. But this is surely an atypical case. In the kind of poor household she is describing, one also suspects that the youngest would suffer, even a male, if in a family with four sons and one daughter. That is, there is a birth-order effect and a sexcomposition effect firmly entangled in the sex-preference effect we are concerned with.
Coming to more quantitative findings, the evidence is once more not as unequivocal as it appears at first glance or as it would appear if one went by a WHO review of the area (World Health Organization, 1986). Footnote 1 on Page 2 of this review gives away the biased stand from which it proceeds: "Studies cited in this review are thus by definition limited mainly to those that have found evidence of discrimination; studies that have found no such differences are therefore not mentioned here." Apparently, this has been done to "convey a sense of urgency of the problem." The logic of this stand is puzzling. You can hardly point to the gravity of, say, a water shortage in a region by singling out the six homes with no water and ignoring the dozens that have more water than they know what to do with.
To take the quantitative evidence of breastfeeding first, most studies re-

port no significant sex differentials in duration (for example, Wyon and Gordon, 1971; Huffman et al., 1980). Jain and Bongaarts (1981), in an analysis of World Fertility Survey data from eight countries (including Bangladesh, where sex differentials in mortality are high), found no evidence of longer duration of breastfeeding of boys than of girls, in spite of the fact that there is some suggestion in the literature that birth intervals are shorter after a girl than after a boy. In fact, this finding was used to infer (wrongly, as it appears from more direct data) shorter breastfeeding for girls. In any case, it must be stated that even if sex differentials in breastfeeding did exist, it would be difficult to know how to interpret their connection with final nutritional levels.
The mean lengths of breastfeeding in our field study are displayed in Table 3.1 present durations separately for all live births in the last ten years to female respondents in the study as well as those for the current survivors of all live births in the last ten years. Children under the age of one are not included in the calculations of mean breastfeeding duration because so many of them fall in the category of "still breastfeeding," as seen in the last two columns of the table. It is interesting to note that, contrary to expectations, it is among the Tamilians that sex differences in breastfeeding are more heavily weighted against girls.
Next, there are field surveys which take anthropometric measurements and classify them with reference to a standard such as the Harvard standard. There is at least one more problem with the interpretation of findings from such field studies based on

anthropometric measurements. The malnutrition levels reported for the two sexes in several such surveys may be biased by the choice of reference standard. For example, although Sen and Sengupta (1983) and Kielmann and Associates (1983) report a higher incidence of severe malnutrition in girls than in boys, they seem not to

have used sex-specific reference tables for classifying their observations. And the fact is that even the Harvard and National Center for Health Statistics standards commonly employed have girls displaying lower median heights and weights than boys of the same age (see Table 4), and I do not think anyone would argue that there is food dis-

crimination against girls in the populations from which these standards are derived.
I illustrate the relevance of a sexspecific standard by reclassifying the data on which Tables 1 and 2 are based, now using the sex-independent growth chart developed at the Institute of Health and Nutrition, Delhi, which is based on the Harvard standards and now recommended for use in the field by health workers in India. The results are set out in Table 5. The changed picture (as compared with Tables 1 and 2) is striking. No longer can we confidently assert that girls from Uttar Pradesh exhibit better nutritional status than boys. In fact, for most of the age groups and for both measures (weight for age as well as weight for height), it is now the girls who seem more severely deprived. And in the Tamil sample, the earlier relatively small disadvantage to girls is much sharper now.
But there is at least one study which used sex-specific standards to classify its anthropometric measurements and

still found greater malnutrition in girls than in boys in Matlab thana in Bangladesh (see Chen, 1982). Moreover, an equally careful study on one subsample of this project even found that females received less food than males (Chen et al., 1981). While it may be difficult to fault these findings on methodological grounds, one should consider the author's cautionary note (Chen, 1982) that the findings might not be generalizable to other parts of South Asia.
In fact, it is worth noting that once the above food intake study had been corrected for sex differences in dietary requirements based on body mass, physical activity, and the special needs of the female reproductive cycle, it was only for the age group 0-4 years that it could be said with definiteness that the shortfall in food intake was greater for girls than for boys. This finding probably means only the group 1-4 years fell short in food, since breastfeeding is near universal and total in the first year of life in these parts. Unfortunately, this part of their finding has received

considerably less attention than their demonstration of greater discrimination against girls in early childhood.
The little other evidence we have on sex differences in the intra-household distribution of food is again mixed (for summaries, see Table 6 and also Harris, 1990 and Lipton, 1983). Two important points emerge repeatedly. The first is that the more relevant distinction is probably the one between children and adults, although even the interpretation of the fact of greater malnourishment among children has problems given the overrepresentation of children among the poor, that is, among the malnourished (see Lipton, 1983). However, in our study, we found that only in a small percentage of cases were children not likely to be among the first family members to be

fed (see Table 7). There was also a regional differential in this custom, and in households from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, children were given first preference in virtually all cases.
Secondly, it appears that where actual discrimination against girls does exist, it is more likely to begin in late childhood or early adolescence as the girl is socialized for the role of ideal wife and mother (for Bangladesh, see Rizvi, 1983). In India Appadurai (1981) records that any sex discrimination in the gastropolitical roles prescribed for boys and girls tend to start at about age five. But even at these older ages, anthropometric data are increasingly beginning to suggest that we may be making an unduly strong case in favor of a female disadvantage. The actual evidence (see, for example,

Nutrition Foundation of India, 1988; Gopalan, 1987; Chaudhury, 1987) strongly suggests that food imbalances are not a major part of the gender inequalities in South Asia.
DISCUSSION
A variety of interlinked historical and cultural reasons have been advanced to explain the greater female disadvantage in survival, as well as in several other aspects of life, that characterizes the South Asian region in general and the north-western part of this region in particular. These reasons include kinship patterns (for example, Karve, 1965; Dyson and Moore, 1983), the nature of the bargaining position of the sexes in the marriage contract (Sen, 1987), women's levels of economic activity (Schultz, 1978), and the extent to which wheat is the main agricultural crop in a region (Bardhan, 1974; Miller, 1981).
The above factors explain some of the conscious or unconscious motivations behind prevailing gender differences in welfare. At the same time, research attention in this area has tended to be rather diffuse as far as the actual inequalities are concerned. It is too readily assumed that if women do badly on one count, they must do badly on all other counts as well. This as-

sumption needs to be questioned for more effective action against those gender inequalities which actually exist and which are amenable to change.
For example, because we start with the assumption that food discrimination by sex does exist, much research on this subject has been somewhat overzealous in its attempt to document such discrimination. In the process, several methodological refinements have been ignored which might suggest that the situation is not quite so grim after all.
The assumption that there is necessarily gender discrimination in the household allocation of food in South Asian societies has been questioned in this paper. After a critical review of the existing knowledge on this subject, it has been concluded that there is no clear picture. There may be a certain amount of discrimination, but it is far from being uniform even in those areas which exhibit the largest sex differentials in child survival. In passing, it may be mentioned that it would be interesting to do a similar review of the evidence on the greater nutritional deprivation of girls in the Middle East, another region where gender differences in physical welfare are believed to be marked.
If the analysis here has tended to swing too much in the direction of

trying to suggest that sex differentials in childhood nutritional levels are negligible or even nonexistent, it is perhaps the result of an attempt to redress the balance in the existing literature. The more accurate conclusion would be that we do not know enough, and that there is no uniform pattern of gender differentials in child nutritional status in South Asia. But a new look at old data is essential so that we do not divert resources away from areas of life and death where sex differences in welfare are genuinely important and urgently in need of change.
