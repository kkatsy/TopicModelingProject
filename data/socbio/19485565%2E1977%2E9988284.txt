ABSTRACT: This paper examines trends in childlessness for ever-married women in the United States. Data assembled from assorted census materials permit cohort and period investigations for a number of time periods, from 1910 to 1975, for various color and ethnic groups. Whether examined at the period or cohort level, the incidences in percentage rates of childlessness have varied irregularly over time. We focus particularly on the younger cohorts of white women (those beginning fecundity after 1965); they show higher rates of childlessness at each age than any of the older cohorts at similar ages in the reproductive cycle. We suggest that a major portion of the increasing rates of these younger cohorts may be attributed to increases in voluntary childlessness, which in turn may be linked to broader changes in the fabric of society regarding fertility control, contraceptive technology, female work preferences and patterns, and sexual and family norms.

The phenomenon of childlessness has received only modest attention in recent years by sociologists, demographers, and marriage and family-life scholars. In one sense, this void may result from the tendency to view childlessness merely as one of a number of possible fertility outcomes, in this case, zero parity. Since specific attention is seldom focused solely on couples, say, with three children, or with one child, why then should there exist a literature dealing only with persons who have no children?
A second reason involves the actual incidence of childlessness. Over the years, few American women have been without children, and until recently, childlessness rates have been experiencing a steady decline. Indeed, so seldom did the phenomenon occur and so pervasive had been its decline that many investigators concluded that "the desire for children is nearly universal" (Martinson, 1970, p. 314) and that "the majority of childless couples are not that way by choice" (Bell, 1971, p. 417).

Childlessness viewed in this light, of course, is congruent with the pronatalist norms and values in our society concerning marriage and procreation. Since married persons are expected to have children, should want to have children, and should rejoice at the prospect of having children (Veevers, 19736, p. 199), the lack of attention given the study of childlessness may result in part from the general lack of approval afforded the phenomenon by the society at large.
However, some demographers and sociologists in the past few years have argued that the United States is experiencing significant change regarding contraceptive technology, sexual and family norms, and female work patterns and preferences (Presser and Bumpass, 1972; Bumpass, 1973; Westoff, 1976). It is claimed that one result of these alterations is the fact that motherhood is becoming for many a matter for rational evaluation. Because "motherhood [is placed] squarely in competition with other social roles" (Bumpass,

Whether studied at the period or cohort level, this study will suggest that childlessness has not maintained a steady course over the past 65 years in the United States and that, in particular, the incidence of the phenomenon has increased in recent years.

The rates for white women vary considerably by age within any one time period, as well as over time within any one age group. In 1975, for instance, 58.4 per cent of ever-married women in the group 15-19 years old are without children, while in the same year, only 6.8 per cent of the women 45-49 years old are childless. These differences in age-specific rates are also present in the other time periods investigated.
As noted, variability in rates of childlessness is also evident over time in any one age group. As few as 24.2 per cent of ever-married women 20-24 years old were childless in 1910; in 1975, as many as 45.1 per cent of women in this age group were without children. Generally, the period rates show considerable change in magnitude in any one age group between 1910 and 1975. In the younger age groups of ever-married white women, there appear to be increases in the rates of childlessness.
Turning next to nonwhite and Spanish women (middle and bottom panels of Table 2), we find that both groups show
we decided to rely on one classification throughout our time periods. Hence, we developed estimates of nonwhite childlessness rates for 1965, 1970, and 1975. Briefly, we employed a schedule of age-specific ratios of Negro-to-nonwhite childlessness for each of seven age groups, 15-19, 20-24, etc., for the year 1960. These ratios were then divided into the agespecific rates for Negroes for 1965, producing a schedule of estimates of age-specific rates of childlessness for nonwhites. Schedules of nonwhite estimates were produced in the same manner for 1970 and for 197S. It should be noted, however, that the Negro-to-nonwhite ratios of childlessness for 1960 were very close to unity. The lowest (0.9770) was for age group 20-24. The highest (1.0422) was for age group 40--44. Very minor adjustment in the Negro rates was therefore necessary in producing the nonwhite estimates.
2 Childlessness data are provided for Spanishsurname women living in the southwestern United States for 1950 and 1960; for Spanish-heritage women in the United States for 1970 and 1975. We did not make any adjustments in these rates, principally because cohort analyses were not conducted for these women.

patterns similar to those of the whites, although the changes are not as pronounced. Nonwhite women within any one age group have experienced fluctuating rates of childlessness between 1910 and 1975, although not generally to the extent of the whites. Except for a few isolated instances among the youngest women in 1970 and 1975, nonwhites generally show declining age-specific rates of childlessness between 1940 and 1975. The rates for Spanish women show little change, except in the oldest age groups. Generally, they too are experiencing reductions in their age-specific rates.
A more systematic examination is possible with data on the amount of change in childlessness. Table 3 presents percentage change data in the age-specific rates of childlessness between each of the time periods under investigation. Information is provided for white women in the top panel of the table. Between 1910 and 1940, there were increases in all the age-specific rates of childlessness. The intervals thereafter have generally been characterized by declines, although this becomes less the case as the time interval moves closer to the present. For example, all of the white age-specific rates declined between 1950 and 1960, and all but two declined between 1960 and 1965. However, between 1970 and 1975, four of the seven agespecific rates increased, and these increases were all at the youngest ages.
The general kinds of changes experienced by white women, notably the reductions in the age-specific rates, have also occurred among nonwhite and Spanish women (middle and bottom panels of Table 3). Generally, the percentage decreases are somewhat greater among the nonwhite women than among the whites, primarily because the nonwhites had higher rates of childlessness in the earlier years. Although data for only three time intervals are available for the

Spanish women, their experiences are more characterized by decreases than increases in the age-specific rates of childlessness.
These analyses have relied on agespecific rates of childlessness, and seven time periods (six time intervals) have been examined. For the most part, all groups have experienced decreases in their rates, although there appears a tendency in recent time periods, especially among the white women, for increases to occur in the age-specific rates. However, there are certain problems in analyzing rates of childlessness on a cross-sectional basis in the manner we have followed to this point. The major liability involves the fact that we are not following the same persons through time, but rather persons of the same age groups. Additional and perhaps more insightful information regarding

changes in childlessness behavior may be provided with cohort analyses (cf. Price, 1974, and Hastings and Robinson, 1975).
The percentages in Table 2 permit an examination of changes in childlessness for six open cohorts of ever-married women, each of which is identified by the year in which its members were 15--19 years of age, the first years in which there occurs a potential for childbearing.3 These are the 1940, 1950, 1960, 1965, 1970, and 1975 cohorts. Of course, only the 1940 cohort has completed its fecundity period; the remaining five cohorts are still in the childbearing years.
We have plotted in Figure 1 the rates of
3 These cohorts are open cohorts. Women become members as they marry. Once married, they retain membership, irrespective of subsequent changes in marital status. The cohort literature in demography contains reference to open cohorts; see, for examples, Price, 1968 and 1974.

childlessness for the six cohorts of white women for as many time periods as there are data available. The 1940 cohort began its childbearing years (i.e., at age 15-19) with a childlessness rate of slightly more than 50 per cent. By the time the cohort was in the last years of childbearing (i.e., ages 45-49), little more than 10 per cent of its members were childless.
The 1950 and the 1960 cohorts, however, have not yet completed their childbearing years, yet they are already (in 1975) at levels of childlessness lower than that of the 1940 cohort. Less than 7 per cent of the white women beginning childbearing in 1950 (women who were 40-44 years of age in 1975) are childless,

and only 9 per cent of those beginning childbearing in 1960 (women who were 30-34) are childless.
Cohorts beginning their childbearing years after 1960 have been exposed to the risk of fertility for a shorter period of time than any of the cohorts just discussed. However, their rates of childlessness so far are higher than those of any of the earlier cohorts when they were at similar ages. The 1965 cohort is 25-29 years of age in 1975, and it has the highest rate of childlessness at age 25-29 of any of the cohorts preceding it. The experience of the 1970 cohort of ever-married women is one typified by even higher rates of childlessness. Although this cohort is only 20-24

218

years of age in 1975, and therefore not far along in its reproductive life cycle, more than 45 per cent of its members are still childless. By comparison, the 1965 cohort--a group of ever-married women not characterized by especially low levels of childlessness--was only 37 per cent childless when it was 20-24 years of age.
Finally, the 1975 cohort is only at the very beginnings of its fecund years, but its rate of childlessness at this early age is the highest of any of the U.S. cohorts for which information is available. Nearly 60 per cent of its members are without children, a rate almost eight percentage points higher than that of the 1940 cohort when it was at the same age.
Among the cohorts of ever-married white women examined in Figure 1, two conclusions may be presented. First, the oldest cohorts, and therefore those who have completed all or most of their childbearing years, have the lowest rates of childlessness, the 1950 cohort exhibiting the lowest rates of all. Second, the younger cohorts of women (those beginning their childbearing years in 1965, 1970, and 1975) do not appear to be following the childlessness paths of the cohorts who preceded them. These younger cohorts of ever-married women have significantly higher rates of childlessness at each age than any of the older cohorts at similar stages in the reproductive cycle. Even if the future trends in childlessness behavior of these younger cohorts follow the same slopes of the older cohorts (see Figure 1), they will still result in considerably higher rates of childlessness by the time these younger women reach their fiftieth birthday than has already occurred for the older cohorts.
The childlessness experiences of the nonwhite cohorts of ever-married women are not the same as those of the whites. Plotted in Figure 2 for each of six cohorts of ever-married women are age-specific

percentage rates of childlessness. The 1940 nonwhite cohort began with very high levels of childlessness at ages 15-19 (although not as high as any of the white cohorts) and ended its fecund years with 17 per cent of its members having no children. This is the highest level of childlessness at ages 45-49 of any of the cohorts of white or nonwhite women examined in this paper. Pre-1940 cohorts, however, ended their childbearing years with levels of childlessness higher than that of the 1940 nonwhite cohort, as the crosssectional data in Table 2 suggest (see also Farley, 1970, p. 95).
Generally, the age-specific percentage rates of childlessness for the post-1940 cohorts of ever-married nonwhite women are lower than those for the 1940 cohort. For example, at ages 25-29, almost 30 per cent of the 1940 nonwhite cohorts was childless; in contrast, less than IS per cent of the 1950 cohort, and 12 per cent of the 1960 cohort, were childless at ages 25-29. As noted earlier, there is a tendency among the white women for higher rates of childlessness to occur among the younger cohorts; this is not the case among the nonwhite women. There is little evidence in Figure 2 that more childlessness is occurring in the 1965, 1970, and 1975 cohorts, than in the pre-1965 cohorts. In most cases, the rates of childlessness of the younger cohorts are slightly less than, or at about the same level as, the older cohorts.
INTERPRETATION
Our interpretation of childlessness trends in the United States will concentrate on the experiences of the younger cohorts of white women. However, we first pay brief attention to the trends and experiences of the older white women and of all the nonwhite women.
Concerning the white women, our analyses generally show high levels of

For example, the cross-sectional data (in Table 2), along with the studies of other demographers (e.g., Grabill and Glick, 1959), suggest that nearly 20 per cent of the cohort completing its childbearing in 1950 (i.e., the 1920 cohort) was childless. In contrast, the 1950 and 1960 cohorts have experienced lower rates of childlessness than the earlier cohorts. However, the most recent cohorts (those of 1965, 1970, and 1975) show the highest rates of childlessness of any of the cohorts.
The very low rates reported for the 1950 cohort may be attributed, in part, to the

fact that these women passed through their most fecund period (ages 15-29) during the post-World War II "baby boom." Hastings and Robinson (1975, pp. 181182) arrived at a similar conclusion when their estimated proportions of childlessness for this cohort were lower than the minimum levels reported in other studies. Reexamination of Figure 1 indicates that the sharpest decline in childlessness is for this same cohort during the period 1950 to 1960; there was a decrease of more than 40 percentage points in the proportion of childless women (from 55.4 per cent to 12.3 per cent). Moreover, these women had their childbearing activities well under way before the onset of the con-

traceptive revolution of the 1960's and hence were not full participants. They were entering the latter stages of childbearing by 196S when their rate of childlessness was already at the relatively low level of 9.7 per cent.
The 19SS fertility cohort (not included in Figure 1; see Table 2, women aged 35-39 in 1975) entered the childbearing years at the height of the "baby boom"; their childlessness rates are the lowest reported for the entire sample, irrespective of color or age. The 1950 fertility cohort also experienced some residual effects of the "baby boom" and was entering its most fecund period just prior to the contraceptive revolution; hence, its low levels of childlessness. The upper-right quadrant of the "White Women" panel in Table 2 graphically depicts the results of these two "period" effects--extremely low agespecific proportions of childlessness for women who were fecund during the postwar years, yet who were too far along in their childbearing to benefit from the "fertility control revolution."
Nonwhite ever-married women of the pre-1940 and 1940 cohorts show very high rates of childlessness, and the cohorts thereafter report fewer of their members to be without children. The youngest nonwhite cohorts (those of 1965, 1970, and 1975) do not appear to be experiencing higher rates than the 1950 and 1960 cohorts, as was the case among white women. These trends for nonwhite wives are different from those of the white wives and hence need a post-hoc explanation of another sort. Blacks, who comprise the majority of the nonwhite sample, have historically evidenced higher rates of childlessness, by age group as well as in the aggregate, than white wives. Reasons for this differential are numerous and complex, but may include higher rates of venereal disease (Veevers, 1971, p. 291), malnutrition, lack of access to comprehensive medical care, and substandard

health levels (Bogue, 1969, pp. 724-729; Farley, 1970, pp. 109-111; see also Kunz and Brinkerhoff, 1969, for a related although less applicable statement). In other words, the higher rates of childlessness among Blacks have possibly been due mainly to involuntary factors.
Trends in improved health conditions and medical care after 1940 contributed to the steady declines in childlessness observed for nonwhites, especially among the older cohorts. However, a countertrend was underway at the same time which may have offset the true impact of improved health conditions on fertility. This countertrend was the contraceptive revolution, affecting both white and nonwhite wives. Farley (1970, p. 10) reports that the proportion öf married nonwhite women using some method of birth control increased from approximately 60 per cent in 1960 to 75 per cent in 1965. What factors can account then for the relatively lower rates of childlessness among the youngest nonwhite cohorts? Farley (1970, p. 244) presents some insights into this trend. Despite the fact that there is little difference by race in the reported number of children desired or expected, there are some fertility differentials. Fertility rates are higher for Black women than for white women in rural areas; they are also higher for Blacks in the lower social and economic levels than they are for whites in similar circumstances. Finally, Black teenagers have traditionally had higher fertility rates than whites. These fertility patterns, coupled with the trend for childlessness to vary inversely with fertility (Hastings and Robinson, 1975, p. 181), would seem to contribute to the low levels of childlessness reported for the nonwhite sample. Although we do not provide a cohort analysis of childlessness for Spanish women, the cross-sectional data for them suggest childlessness behavior similar to that of the nonwhite women.
Our major concern is with providing an

interpretation for the increasing rates of childlessness among the 196S, 1970, and 197S cohorts of white ever-married women. As we have noted in the preceding section, period and cohort data suggest that the younger ever-married white women are reporting higher rates of childlessness than those who are older. It is plausible to hypothesize that these higher rates may be due in part to the increasing incidence of voluntary childlessness, namely, the decision between a wife and husband to remain without children.
It is often argued that most of the childlessness occurring among U.S. women since the 1940's was due to involuntary sterility or subfecundity (Veevers, 1971; Gustavus and Henley, 1971). So prevalent is this view that recent family textbooks by Kephart (1966) and Landis and Landis (1968), for example, provide "an estimate of the incidence of childlessness [and then] . . . a discussion of factors contributing to subfecundity and sterility, thereby revealing an implicit assumption that fecundity problems are the only cause of childlessness, and that something should be done to help the childless couple" (Veevers, 19736, p. 199).
Recently, some investigators have begun to pay more attention to the possibility that some couples will decide voluntarily to be childless (Pohlman, 1970; Veevers, 1971, 1972, 1973a, 19736; Gustavus and Henley, 1971; Poston, 1974, 1976), and a modest literature is developing on this topic. Furthermore, many would agree that the current emergence of voluntary childlessness may be linked with broader changes in the fabric of U.S. society regarding fertility control, contraceptive technology, sexual and family norms, and female work patterns and preferences. We examine this argument in the paragraphs below in an attempt to understand more fully the increasing rates of childlessness among the young cohorts

of white women discussed in the preceding section.
The basic argument begins with the market availability of the oral contraceptive in the early 1960's and its rapid diffusion in the population. The rates of adoption were clearly unprecedented. Although complex to measure precisely because of the ambiguous nature of the "risk" population, one way of estimating its degree of diffusion is by examining its use among married U.S. women aged 15-44. Fifteen per cent of this population used an oral contraceptive in 196S, 22 per cent by 1970, and over 25 per cent by 1975 (Westoff, 1976, p. 56; see Ryder, 1972, pp. 233-240 for another statement). These rates of acceptance were due to the significantly improved levels of contraceptive protection, along with the fact that the oral contraceptive is sexually unobtrusive. Bumpass (1973, p. 67) has observed that thereafter "significant proportions of the population came to expect fertility control to be both complete and unobtrusive." He also observed that it is "likely that the rapid diffusion may be attributable as much to the sexual unobtrusiveness of the pill as to its greater efficacy. The ensuing revolution in fertility, however, derives from the latter."
To quote Bumpass (1973, p. 67) at length:
The essential characteristic of this revolution is that childbearing can now be voluntary in a radically different sense than ever before. Under the previous fertility regime, women could not confidently plan a lifetime of childlessness, nor even the prevention of unwanted fertility. Obviously, some women could and did avoid unwanted fertility but no individual could be sure of that outcome in advance. The most effective traditional contraceptives markedly delayed and reduced in number accidental conceptions but did not prevent these altogether. Among women using such traditional methods to prevent unwanted pregnancy, nearly half failed within a five-year period (Ryder and Westoff, 1965: 334), in part as a consequence of the coital-relatedness of these methods.

The gestalt that accompanied this regime was one in which the adult role expectations of women were structured around motherhood, and the separation of work and home in industrial society buttressed this role structure. Cultural values with respect to fertility were, in part, rationalizations of the inevitable.
Although "the pill" set the revolution in motion, it is a mistake to refer solely to these changes as the "contraceptive revolution," since as Bumpass has noted, the alterations really involve a revolution in fertility control values. The introduction of the intrauterine device in 1965 was followed by an equally rapid diffusion among the risk population (Ryder, 1972; Westoff, 1976). In the sixties and early seventies as well, there have been dramatic changes in the attitudes and behavior of the American population concerning receptivity to male and female sterilization (Presser and Bumpass, 1972). The attitudes of the U.S. public with respect to abortion have also altered dramatically since the mid-1960's. For example, Jones and Westoff (1972) report significant increases between 1965 and 1970 in the numbers of American wives, by race and religion, approving abortion for various reasons. These changes may be as much a result of the changes in fertility control values as they are a response to concerns "with the role of accidental pregnancy in limiting the achievement of women" and with the poor health consequences occurring with illegal abortions (Bumpass, 1973, p. 68). And it must be remembered that these attitudinal changes favoring abortions occurred prior to the Supreme Court decision of 1973.
Important for our understanding of the increasing trends in childlessness is the fact that the changing values of this fertility control revolution have legitimized and have begun to make possible the realization of equal opportunity between the sexes because nonfamilial roles for women are now a realistic option. "The potential

for complete fertility control makes childbearing--when and if--a matter of choice in an ultimate sense that never before existed. For the first time motherhood itself is fully a matter for rational evaluation. Obviously childbearing roles offer much that is rewarding, but these rewards are not likely to be experienced equally by all women. . . . [Motherhood has become a competitor] with other social roles" (Bumpass, 1973, p. 68).
We have attempted to provide in some detail the basic arguments concerning recent changes in fertility control, especially as they relate to the question of childlessness. If the above reasoning is true and the society is indeed experiencing a major change in fertility control values, these kinds of explanations are capable of accounting for the increases in childlessness occurring in the United States in the late 1960's and early 197O's among the cohorts of young white women. These arguments suggest that much of the childlessness is voluntary and that the increases have not been due solely to increasing sterility and subfecundity stemming from involuntary factors.
Quite obviously, there are methodological and conceptual problems with drawing inferences in this manner. Survey and interview data, particularly the latter, designed especially for identifying reasons and justifications for voluntary childlessness would be most helpful. Materials of this type would allow investigators to sort out the extent to which changes in fertility control values and related adjustments in sexual and family norms and the roles of women and motherhood are indeed linked with the emergence of voluntary childlessness. Additional research similar to Veevers' (1973a) in-depth analysis of voluntary childlessness is necessary before we will fully understand the recent emergence of childlessness among the young cohorts of white women in the United States.
