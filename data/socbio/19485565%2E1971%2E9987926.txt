Population genetics is mathematical genetics. "The role of the mathematical theory is that of an intermediary between the bodies of factual knowledge discovered at two levels, that of the individual and that of the population. It must deduce from the postulates at the level of the individual and from models of population structure what is to be expected in populations, and then modify its postulates and models on the basis of any discrepancies with observation and so on" (Wright, 1960).
Obviously population genetics can contribute to reduction of disease only to the extent that disease is genetic. There are many ways to estimate what fraction of disease is genetic, none of them satisfactory. The frequency of single-gene traits (say, M) provides an underestimate. To this may be added a proportion of diseases of obscure etiology with elevated recurrence risks in relatives of patients. One theory (Falconer, 196S) estimates heritability, the fraction of the underlying variation which is in one sense heritable. In this case, if h? is the heritability of the i* disease and ft is its prevalence, the weighted sum

C -- 2 hi fi
i
may be taken as an estimate of the prevalence of genetic disease of complex etiology, and M + C estimates the total frequency of genetic disease. Unfortunately, while it is easy to estimate heritability, it is virtually impossible to exclude environment common to family members as a source of bias or to determine whether the model of cumulative gene action under which heritability can be estimated is valid. Thus, any estimate of the prevalence of genetic disease is unreliable.
While population genetics does not provide much help in estimating what fraction of disease is genetic, and in fact does not indicate whether such an estimate is meaningful, none of the applications of population genetics to disease control depends on this estimate. In this paper I will discuss four applications: estimation of recurrence risks for genetic counseling, assortative mating, selective termination of reproduction, and changes in systematic pressure.

diagnosis of affection in family members. Usually the diagnosis must be extremely precise; for example, there are many simply-inherited forms of cleft palate, which for genetic counseling should be differentiated from the residual class of obscure etiology. The second operation is prognosis for the disease in patients and for recurrence in relatives. The final step is communication of medical and genetic information to the patient or his relatives.
When we consider that precise specification of recurrence risks is the central problem of genetic counseling, without which the transaction is mere charlatanism, it is remarkable that no standards have been set and that, for diseases of complex etiology, even the theory is poorly developed. A minimum standard would be that affection in the parents and sibs of a subject be known and that at least this information be used to specify the recurrence risk. But how should the risk be estimated: by follow-up of a subsequent child in a pitifully small number of families of a particular type (for example, with one affected parent and 1 of 3 prior sibs affected) or by fitting a model to a much larger number of families of various compositions? In the latter event, should the model assume cumulative gene action (Falconer, 1965; Edwards, 1967; Smith, 1970), or independent gene action at one or many loci (Morton et al., 1970), or a more eclectic beta distribution of risk? Until these theoretical problems are resolved and adequate data are submitted to critical analysis (and you can count on the fingers of one hand the investigators attempting to do this), standards of genetic counseling for diseases of complex etiology will remain far below other medical specialties.
Recurrence risks may be tabulated for any genetic hypothesis which fits segregation data. Very limited experience supports the expectation that two hypotheses which

fit a substantial body of data necessarily predict closely similar risks for all the commonly observed segregation patterns and therefore provide adequate estimates of recurrence risks.
While it may therefore not be important for genetic counseling to discriminate between two well-fitting genetic hypotheses, the long-term effects of treatment and carrier detection depend critically on the genetic basis of affection. The prevention of disease due to a single locus with manifest carriers is relatively easy, whereas multifactorial systems offer less opportunity for carrier detection and respond poorly to selection on a rare phenotype. Even collection of large bodies of data suitable for complex segregation analysis may not resolve the basis of affection, although providing reliable risks for genetic counseling.
Special challenges are posed by chromosomal anomalies, which may segregate differently among families. Analysis must test for and describe this heterogeneity. A possible approach is through the hypergeometric Gini-Skellam distribution, which arises through binomial trials from risks which vary as a beta distribution among families (Morton, 1969).
ASSORTATIVE MATING
The frequencies of some genetic diseases could be markedly reduced by small alterations of mating pattern, without necessarily changing fertility of any part of the population. A simple example is sickle-cell disease, caused by homozygosis for the Hbg" alíele of hemoglobin. Patients have severe anemia and usually die young. Since this alíele is common in many African populations, complete avoidance of matings between carriers would reduce the frequency of deaths from this dreadful disease from at least one hundred thousand per year to zero.
Carriers would be free to mate with non-

carriers, since this union produces no affected children. Two carriers who married would be sure of having no affected children if they practiced adoption or artificial insemination ("semi-adoption") by a noncarrier male. From the standpoint of future generations, adoption and semiadoption in AS X AS marriages are better than negative assortative mating, since they reduce the S gene frequency at the same time they avoid carrier matings. However, this difference is rather trivial because most carriers marry noncarriers even under random mating. Of course, research is needed to determine whether these practices involve any undesirable psychological, social, or political side effects in the populations where the S alíele is frequent, and whether the cost of a program for detection and education of carriers is less than for other public health measures, such as control of infectious diseases, which would be of equal or greater benefit. Medical advances which could make sickle-cell disease benign must be sought and if found would make a program of negative assortative mating less attractive. Therefore, such a program is best thought of as a stopgap measure, useful until effective therapy (if ever feasible) can be devised.
There are other genes producing severe disease in homozygotes, reliably detected in carriers, and reaching high frequencies in some populations, whose effects could therefore be controlled by negative assortative mating. Examples are thalassemia in several Mediterranean populations and certain rare récessives in isolates. For the latter, the frequency of affection could be substantially reduced even in the absence of reliable carrier detection, if affected individuals and their first-degree relatives married outside the isolate or practiced adoption or semi-adoption from outside the isolate. Such a procedure virtually assures

unaffected children to the outmarrying individuals, but is less efficient for reducing disease in the whole isolate, which contains many carriers who are not first-degree relatives of patients.
SELECTIVE TERMINATION OF REPRODUCTION
Under certain conditions differential reproduction can be an efficient method for control of genetic disease. It may operate in two essentially different ways. A fraction p of carriers recognized phenotypically, or as children of patients, or through probability as relatives of patients, may reduce their fertility by a fraction t (i.e., the ratio of their mean fertility to the population mean is 1 -- t), without regard to the phenotypes of their children. This is equivalent to a selection coefficient pt against carriers, the effect of which is easily predicted and will be substantial if pt is large. The efficiency of this method is limited by the difficulty of making pt large, both because of lack of interest in carriers and the fact that carrier detection is now practicable for only a small fraction of genetic disease.
Alternatively, carriers may limit reproduction because of the birth of an affected child, in the extreme case terminating reproduction as soon as the first affected child is born. This would have a disastrous effect on the power of genetic methods to determine mode of inheritance from segregation data, since all patients would be isolated cases, but there would be some reduction in the frequency of genetic disease. The efficiency of this method is limited by lack of carrier interest, the small proportion of carriers who have affected children, and the fact that much genetic disease has onset too late to guide family planning.
For illustration, let us suppose the extreme case of no reproduction after the

tions, which are gross if s is large, this simple result is rather accurate. I t shows that the frequency of a rare dominant disease responds quickly to changes in mutation or selection.
I I . X-LINKED RECESSIVE
On the above simplifying assumptions,
A = M(1 -- g) -- qs/3, k = u + s/3
since selection acts only through males, who carry one-third of the X chromosomes. Thus, the initial equilibrium is at q0 = 3u/s and the final equilibrium at Q = 3cu/s. The time required to go halfway to the new equilibrium is
t = (3/s) In 2 for change in mutation = (3c/s) In 2 for change in selection
The frequency of a rare X-linked recessive disease responds only one-third as quickly to changes in mutation or selection as an autosomal dominant disease, but the response is still rapid. For example, with s = % and c = 2, a doubling of the mutation rate would carry an X-linked disease halfway to the new equilibrium in about 3 generations (4ln2), whereas halving the selection coefficient would take twice as long to produce the same change in disease frequency.
I I I . AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE
Recessivity complicates the analysis by introducing two factors which are unimportant for autosomal dominant and Xlinked recessive diseases: inbreeding (measured by F) and selection against carriers (measured by hs, where h is the dominance). The situation is represented as follows:

There are many special cases, according to which parameters are changed and which are negligible.
Case 1. Selection through inbreeding. Many isolated and primitive populations have mean coefficients of inbreeding in the neighborhood of F = 0.04, compared with which h and q are negligible, and so we may assume that k = Fs. At equilibrium q0 = u/Fs.
Suppose that the population now becomes panmictic by breakdown of isolates. If h is negligible and qs > > u, we see that k = 2qs, and at the new equilibrium Q = y/u/T. The time required to go halfway to equilibrium is approximately t = ( l / 2 Q i ) In 2. This is a much slower response to change than for autosomal dominants and X-linked récessives. With Q = 0.002 and 5 = 1, about 350 generations are required to go halfway to equilibrium, or about 8,700 years. Thus gene frequencies for recessive diseases may be still substantially below their equilibrium values if inbreeding were reduced as long ago as the beginning of the Neolithic, while the gene pool has hardly begun to respond to reduction of inbreeding during the last century. One effect of this is to tend to make estimates of recessive mutation rates too small. Another effect, of greater medical importance, is that the impact of rare recessive disease in modern populations is below its equilibrium value, which will be approached very slowly.
Evidence from Catholic marriage dispensations suggests that inbreeding was low in Europe just before the Industrial Revolution, but increased markedly during the nineteenth century, probably because increase of family size preceded

The time to go halfway to the new equilibrium at Q = v/(s + v) is approximately t = [l/(2Qs + v)] In 2. This is large if v is very small.
Now suppose that the system has reached equilibrium under heterosis and reverts to a mutation-selection balance (v = 0; h -f- F = 0). The time required to go halfway to the new equilibrium at Q = ·\fufs is t = [l/2Qs] In 2. Approach to equilibrium is extremely slow.

for change in s.
DISCUSSION
I hope that this brief and much simplified presentation of some aspects of population genetics relevant to disease control has made the reader conscious of the deep problems in this field. The biological facts are often in doubt. Is cystic fibrosis maintained in Caucasian populations by hétérozygote advantage, as some have suggested, or does an historical accident account for its unusually high frequency by genetic drift? Is sickle-cell disease likely to be curable in the near future, or is a program of genetic control through negative assor-

tative mating more promising? We know far too little about the parameters of human population genetics, such as patterns of recurrence risks among families for diseases of complex inheritance, spontaneous and induced mutation rates per codon, the fraction of amino-acid substitutions which are markedly deleterious, the magnitude of weak selective pressures, and the relative forces of genetic drift and variable selection. Population geneticists cannot be dogmatic.
For the next few years, as I have suggested at length elsewhere (Morton, in press), the most fruitful directions for research in human population genetics seem to be in what Haldane called "bean-bag genetics": the precise analysis of modes of inheritance, with special regard to heterogeneity in diseases of complex inheritance and to that useful byproduct, specific and reliable recurrence risks for genetic counseling. Genetic analysis will increasingly have to cope with the effects of selective termination of reproduction, which must be studied also for its impact on frequency of genetic disease. Family planning, with its emphasis on the right of parents and the interest of society to prevent genetic disease, has applications and consequences which it is the responsibility of population genetics to determine.
Finally, if we turn our attention to more futuristic aspects of genetic disease control, to genetic engineering, the feasibility of the techniques proposed is in much doubt. The rate of genetic change is so slow, the number of population geneticists so small, the history of our science so short, the importance of understanding our genetic heritage so great, and the unexplored ocean of the contemporary gene pool so vast, that at this juncture it seems unrewarding to speculate about the consequences of techniques yet to be developed or applied.
