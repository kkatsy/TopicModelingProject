Among a number of possible genetic consequences of family planning (Matsunaga, 1966), the effect of changing parental age patterns upon recurring mutations, both chromosomal and genie, is the one which we can appreciate as of obvious "eugenic" relevance. Here, the argument is based on deduction from two empirical facts. First, demographic data in most industrialized countries show that there has been over several decades, as a result of family planning practiced by more and more people, a gradual concentration of childbearing at younger ages than in former times. This can be seen at once from the decreasing proportion of older mothers, say over 40 years of age, in vital statistics data. Second, there are strong positive associations of parental ages with the production of certain chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations. Whatever biological mechanisms are involved in such associations (for discussions, see Penrose, 1955; Vogel, 1961), the genetic consequence of younger parenthood is beneficial because it lessens the additional genetic burden that would have arisen if the parents had borne children at advancing ages.
The purpose of this paper is to make a

quantitative assessment of the extent to which the changing parental age patterns may bring about a benefit in terms of the public health of a population as a whole. Such an attempt has been made in several countries (Matsunaga, 1966; Penrose, 1967; Vogel, 1967), but the major concern of the authors was with the effect upon the incidence of Down's syndrome. Demographic data here used are taken from Japan, partly because they are readily accessible to the present author, but mainly because they show distinctly the so-called demographic transition which has taken place during a relatively short period in that country. As a more or less similar tendency is seen in certain other countries, Japan's experience is an example which may perhaps apply to many other countries where the practice of family planning now prevails. It is assumed that the relative incidence by parental age of the chromosomal aberrations and dominant mutations under consideration have remained constant during the past decades and that the mutation rates are the same in Japanese as in European populations. The few comparative studies so far conducted in Japan to estimate the rates of

chromosomal andgenie mutations did not reveal anyracial differences in this regard (Matsunaga, 1962;Tonomuraet al., 1966; Kikuchi et al., 1969).

SECULAR CHANGES IN PARENTAL AGE PATTERNS

Table 1 gives distributions of parental

ages in Japan for selected years, for

maternal agesince 1925,and for paternal

age since 1952 (when it was introduced

into thevital statistics records). The pro-

portion of mothers aged 19 or less de-

creased from 6.0% in 1925to 1.2% in

1968, andmothers aged 35 or more de-

creased from 20.5% to only 4.8% during

the same period. A similar change is seen

in paternal agepattern; during 1952 to

1968 theproportion offathers aged 24 or

less decreased from 10.1% to 7.1%, and of

fathers aged 40 ormore from 14.1% to

only 2.8%.Thedecline inthe proportion

of older parents isparticularly remarkable, 3

resulting in adecrease in the mean parental ages of more than oneyear.

However, the most sensitive indicator for theabove change is found in the variance of parental ages. The variancefor maternal agedecreased from 45.5 in 1925 to 17.8 in 1968 andthat forpaternal age, from 45.4in 1952to 21.2 in 1968. Accordingly, the coefficients of variation diminished considerably in both cases.
All these changes clearly indicate that there has been inJapan during the past five decades a trend, which began slowly but later accelerated (with the impetus of the Eugenic Protection Law issued in 1948), toward concentration of childbearing at mother's age of 25-29 and at father's age around 30.

increase with maternal age is rather slow until the mother reaches the age of 35 years, and then it rises almost exponentially as the mother approaches the menopause. The pattern of association has been found to be the same in 11 countries (Penrose and Smith, 1966), suggesting that the underlying mechanism is purely biological, irrespective of ethnic and cultural factors. Similar dependency upon maternal age has been noted for Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY), triple-X female (Penrose, 1964; Court Brown, Law, and Smith, 1969), 13-trisomy and 18-trisomy syndromes, but not for XYY and Turner's syndrome (XO) (Lenz, 1970). The same situation seems to pertain to chromosomally abnormal abortuses. The 45,X anomaly and polyploidy are not age dependent, while certain autosomal trisomies are commoner in abortions from older women (Carr, 1967). There is, however, one notable exception, trisomy 16, which is not associated with increased maternal age (Polani, 1966).
Table 2 illustrates the relative incidence for Down's syndrome and sex chromosome trisomies. Of all cases with clinical signs of Down's syndrome, the overwhelming majority (93%) are 21-trisomy, for which the rise of relative incidence with advancing maternal age is even steeper, about 5% are translocation type (D/G and G/G, each with almost equal frequency), and about 2% are chromosomal mosaicism (Tonomura et al., 1966). As to translocation Down's syndrome, its occurrence has generally been believed to be independent of maternal age, but a recent examination of Japanese data on 102 such cases has revealed that the relative incidence for sporadic D/G translocation apparently declines with increasing maternal age, while the reverse is true for sporadic G/G translocation (Matsunaga and Tonomura, 1972).

ing the two classes, the effect of maternal age virtually disappears.
Applying the relative incidence figures for each quinquennial maternal age given in Table 2 to the data for maternal age distributions in Table 1, it is possible to estimate the relative decrease in the frequencies of Down's syndrome (as a whole) and sex chromosome trisomies, owing to the changing parental age patterns. For example, the relative incidence of Down's syndrome for the year of 1925 may be calculated as follows: 0.40 X 6.0 + 0.61 X 27.2 + O.SS X 26.6+ 0.82 X 19.7 + 2.33 X 14.1 + 5.20 X 5.7 + 10.11 X 0.7 = 119.346. Corresponding figures for the other years are obtained in the same way and are given in Table 3 relative to

author also reported a positive association of maternal age with one specific type of chromosome deletion, 18p- (Lenz, 1970). Since these two types of structural abnormalities are much rarer than the trisomie conditions, they are less important in practical consideration.
Finally, one would ask if there is any specific type of chromosomal aberration which occurs in negative association with parental ages. So far no such conditions have been found, with the exception of Down's syndrome due to D/G translocation (Matsunaga and Tonomura, 1972). I t is possible that this type of Down's syndrome is proportionately increased with the changing maternal age pattern relative to the 21-trisomy type.

the figure for 1925. It maybe deduced that the incidence of these abnormalities must have decreased by 30-40% in Japan during the past forty years.
Recently, it has been reported that paternal age has an effect upon one specific type of Turner's syndrome, i.e., 45,XO/ 46,XXqi (Lenz, 1970). Judging from the limited data available, the pattern of the reported association seems to be similar to that found with respect to dominant mutations to be mentioned later. The same

PARENTAL AGE AND GENE MUTATIONS
In order to measure parental age effects on mutation rates, it is prerequisite to identify the individuals carrying a new mutation. This is possible for dominant and sex-linked conditions, but not for autosomal recessive conditions. There is some evidence that paternal age, but not maternal age, has a profound influence on the mutation rates for certain dominant conditions, i.e., chondrodystrophy, acrocephalosyndactyly (Apert's syndrome) (Penrose, 1961), fibrodysplasia ossificans (Lenz, 1970), and arachnodactyly (Marian's syndrome) (Penrose, 1961; Murdoch, Walker, and McKusick, 1972). An effect of paternal age on hemophilia A has been suggested (Herrmann, 1966), but is not established (Barrai et al., 1968). Based on the available data (Vogel, 1961; Lenz, 1970), the pattern of association with paternal ageseems tobe strikingly similar and nonlinear for at least three of the four conditions mentioned above. Taking the overall incidence as unity, the relative risk is approximately 0.5 for fathers aged 29 and less, then rises to

about 1.0 for fathers aged 30-39, and about 3 for fathers aged 40 and more. Applying these figures to the data for paternal age distribution given in Table 1, the relative decrease in the incidence of new mutations at those loci may be estimated to be more than 20% in Japan during the 17 years since 1952 (Table 3). It is to be noted that the corresponding reduction during the same period in the incidence of the trisomie conditions is of the same magnitude, i.e., 18-27%.
ASSESSMENT OF THE FRACTION OF THE MUTATIONAL LOAD AFFECTED BY PARENTAL AGES
It is now pertinent to inquire to what extent our mutational load may be lessened, as a whole, owing to the changing parental age patterns.
It has been generally accepted that chromosomal anomalies are observed in about 10 per 1,000 newborn infants, of which about 3.5 are of trisomie conditions that are known to occur with increasing maternal age (United Nations, 1966). However, recent surveys conducted in Ontario (Sergovich et al., 1969), New Haven (Lubs and Ruddle, 1970), Boston (Gerald and Walzer, 1970), and Edinburgh (Ratcliffe et al., 1970) have all shown lower incidences of the trisomies (Table 4), the average being

about 1.8 per 1,000 births. While the figures vary considerably from place to place owing to sampling fluctuations as well as to different maternal age distribution, they suggest that there may be about 2,000 trisomies per million newborns. If there occurred a change in the maternal age patterns to the extent that results in a 30-40% decrease in the incidence of trisomies as shown in Table 3, this would mean a decrease by about 600-800 trisomies per million newborns (in the course of about 40 years).
Further, it is known that 20-25% of spontaneous abortions carry a detectable chromosomal abnormality, of which about 40% are of autosomal trisomies (World Health Organization, 1966; Dhadial, Machin, and Tait, 1970). If their dependency upon maternal age follows the same pattern as shown in Table 2, and if we assume the frequency of spontaneous abortions to be about 10%, then the number of miscarriages saved, under the same conditions set out above, would be approximately 1,000,000 X 0.1 X 0.2 ~< 0.25 X 0.4 X 0.3 ~ 0.4 = 2,400 ~ 4,000. . Turning to the effect on gene mutations, Table 5 gives the estimated mutation rates for three dominant abnormalities on which paternal age effect was demonstrated; as
