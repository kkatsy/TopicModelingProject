ABSRACT:This paper investigates the characteristics of U.S. white women who have adopted one or more children. A form of nonbiological parenthood such as adoption has received little attention in the social science literature. The paper examines those individual characteristics that are the most influential in accounting for variation in adoption behavior: age at interview, parity, and fecundity status. The main determinants of adoption have tended to remain constant over time. The need for further research in the area of adoption behavior is discussed.

This paper investigates the characteristics of white women in the United States who have adopted one or more children. There is a substantial literature devoted to studies of biological parenthood, but a form of nonbiological parenthood such as adoption has received very little attention. This paper is an attempt to address this void.
Demographically, adoption is a relatively rare event. Out of an estimated 26.1 million ever-married white women between the ages of 15 and 44 in the United States in 1982, only 2.3 per cent (or about 650,000) had adopted one or more children. The percentages were about the same in 1976and 1973.Nevertheless, adoption is an important and very relevant means of family formation for these women, especially for that subset for whom biological childbearing is difficult or impossible.

havior: age at interview, parity, and fecundity status. We hope that this study will further our understanding of a demographically and sociologically important phenomenon.
PRIOR STUDIES OF ADOPTION
In part because of the scarcity of data, there have been few analyses of adoption behavior as a means of family formation. Consequently, very little is known on a nationwide basis about the characteristics of person who have and who have not adopted, or of those factors most highly associated with adoptive behavior. Most prior studies of adoption have focused on the characteristics of adoptive parents and were largely restricted to individual states or to particular adoption agencies (Leahy, 1933; Braden, 1970; among others).

This paper examines those character- The first national study of the characistics that are the most influential in ac- teristics of adoptive women was concounting for variation in adoption be- ducted by Bonham (1977). He analyzed

data from the 1973 National Survey of Family Growth and the 1955 Growth of American Families Survey. He confirmed the results of earlier studies with regard to age, i.e., adoptive women tended to be older. Unlike earlier studies, however, he reported that socioeconomic characteristics bore little relationship to adoption, with the exception of labor force participation. Bonham's analysis did reveal the important relationship between adoption and fecundity status: In both 1955 and 1973, sterile and subfecund women were much more likely to have adopted than fecund women. And among the sterile women, the noncontraceptively sterile were more likely to have adopted than the contraceptively sterile.
In an analysis of data from the 1976 National Survey of Family Growth, Bachrach (19836) compared the characteristics of biological, step-, and adopted children and confirmed, for the most part, the results of Bonham's earlier study. In a subsequent analysis (1983a), she analyzed the effects of three variables--age at interview, parity, and sterility--on the percentage of women who had adopted. These variables were shown to be strongly related to the likelihood of having adopted (1983a, p. 864). Her analysis is important because it marks the first departure from purely descriptive studies of the determinants of adoption and is the only such investigation of which we are aware prior to that reported in this paper.
Bachrach (1985) has recently published a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of women who have and have not adopted, using data from the 1982 National Survey of Family Growth. She has found, as in 1973 and 1976, that women who have adopted a child tend to be childless, noncontraceptively ster-

ile, and older at the time of the survey (Bachrach, 1985, pp. 12-13).
As our review indicates, only one previous investigation has analyzed the determinants of adoption within a multivariate framework, and this study focused on a single year. In the present paper we will ascertain the extent to which the influences of age, parity, and fecundity status on the decision to adopt have changed during the period 1973 to 1982.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data on the characteristics of women in 1982, 1976, and 1973 who have and who have not adopted one or more children have been taken from the three cycles of the National Surveys of Family Growth (NSFG-I, NSFG-II, and NSFG-III). The samples numbered 9,797 in 1973,8,611 in 1976, and 7,969 in 1982 (see Pratt, 1977; Hendershot and Pratt, 1979; and Bachrach et al., forthcoming, for descriptions and technical documentation). We follow the recommendations of the National Center for Health Statistics and base our analyses on weighted rather than sample data (Bachrach et al., forthcoming).
In this paper, we restrict the samples to ever-married white women between the ages of 15 and 44. We focus on whites, given the racial and ethnic differences both in adoption behavior and in the characteristics of those who have adopted (Bachrach, 1983a; Bonham, 1977). We examine via log-linear analysis the most influential determinants of adoption behavior: fecundity status, parity, and age at interview. We are concerned with ascertaining the degree to which these characteristics are related to the likelihood of having or not having adopted and the extent to which the impact of these variables may have

changed over time. The crossclassifications of fecundity status by parity by age at interview by adoption status that are the inputs to the log-linear analyses do not contain structural zeros. For example, it is perfectly possible for an older woman with no biological children to be fecund, particularly if she has been voluntarily childless to date. Also, the intrinsic ordering of some of our variables has been taken into account in our investigations and analyses.
Log-linear analysis is a particularly appropriate technique for investigating a relatively rare phenomenon such as adoption behavior. Among white women between the ages of 15 and 44, less than 2.5 per cent in any one survey have adopted one or more children. Log-linear analysis is a preferred procedure for examining the extent to which selected characteristics, and their interactions, are related to a dependent variable such as adoption which is both dichotomous and skewed. The approach has been treated extensively in the literature over the past decade (Goodman, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1976; Bishop et al., 1975; Knoke, 1975;Daymont and Kaufman, 1979; among others), and will not be discussed in any detail here. The following section presents the results of our study.
RESULTS
In generating and using log-linear models of adoption, we have used Goodman's (1970) notation scheme to identify specific interaction effects. For each of three adoption models (i.e., for 1982, 1976, and 1973), maximum likelihood ratio chi-square values (G2), the numbers of degrees of freedom remaining, and thep-values for the chi-square statistics were examined. The percent-

age change values in G2 from the baseline models were also computed.
Inspection of the various log-linear models indicated that no one model offered the best description of adoption for all three years. We chose to employ for each survey year a model examining the effects on adoption of age, parity, and fecundity status, and the interaction of parity with fecundity status. This model performed fairly well in each of the three survey years, explaining 86.1 per cent of the baseline chi-square in 1982,93.9 per cent in 1976, and 89.4 per cent in 1973.1
To evaluate the greater or lesser likelihood of women in a particular category of an independent variable having adopted one or more children, expected-odds ratios were computed following the approach set out by Daymont and Kaufman (1979). For a dichotomous dependent variable such as adoption, an expected-odds ratio provides the odds of being in one category of the dependent variable instead of the other, say, "having adopted" versus "not having adopted," for contrasting categories of one or more independent variables. Table 1 shows the expectedodds ratios for women who have adopted one or more children versus those who have not, by each of the independent variables for each survey year.
Looking first at the 1982 odds ratio for the parity variable, we find that the odds ratio of 4.03 (first row, first column of Table 1) indicates that the odds of childless women having adopted one or more children in 1982 are four times

Turning next to the fecundity status variable2, we find that the odds ratios presented in the first column of Table 1 indicate that in 1982 the odds ofnoncontraceptively sterile women having adopted are almost 4 times those of other women, and subfecund women are more than 3 times as likely to have adopted than other women. As one would expect, fecund women are the least likely to have adopted. The findings for 1976 are similar, except that noncontraceptively sterile women are more than 6 times as likely to have adopted, whereas subfecund women, like contraceptively sterile women, have only slightly more than an equal chance of having adopted. The findings for 1973 (Col. 3 of Table 1) are not as straightforward as those for 1976. This is probably due to the fact that the fecundity-status variable in 1973 grouped contraceptively and noncontraceptively sterile women together into a single (sterile) category, and subfecund and longinterval women into a single (subfecund) category. Thus, in 1973sterile and subfecund women had about the same odds of having adopted, 2.25 versus
2Fecundity status is a five-category, computergenerated variable developed from a series of questions on contraceptive use, and pregnancy and marital history. A woman is classified as contraceptively sterile if she (or her husband) has had a sterilizing operation for contraceptive purposes. A noncontraceptively sterile women is one who has had a sterilizing operation for noncontraceptive reasons or is sterile for other medical reasons. A subfecund woman is one for whom it would be difficult, but not impossible, to conceive or deliver a child; or whose doctor has advised her never to become pregnant (again). A long-interval woman is one who has been married for at least three years, has not used a contraceptive method, and has not been pregnant in the three years prior to the interview. A fecund woman can be of any age or parity, regardless of whether or not she has experienced a pregnancy, has not reached menopause, and is not classified as sterile, subfecund, or long-interval.

2.09. Were more detailed fecundity data available in the 1973 data set, it is likely that the noncontraceptively sterile women would have shown higher odds of having adopted, and that a more narrowly defined category of subfecund women (a category excluding those with long intervals) would have have exhibited higher odds of having adopted. This is probably the reason why, for instance, sterile and subfecund women were so similar in 1973 but so dissimilar in 1976 and 1982.
Finally, with respect to age at interview, the odds ratios indicate the increased chances of older women having adopted, versus not having adopted, compared to younger women. This is particularly true with respect to women interviewed in 1976 and 1973 (Col. 2 and 3, Row eleven). In 1982, the odds of older women having adopted are less than 2 times those of younger women. The odds are about 4 times as great for older women in 1976 and in 1973. This difference could be due to a compositional effect, that is, a shift in the age structure of the populations across the survey years, rather than to an increased tendency for younger women to adopt. One way to analyze the effects of changes such as compositional effects is, of course, to merge the data for the three years and to introduce a fourth independent variable, time, to control for such changes. However, such a strategy would have meant collapsing the fecundity status categories in 1982 and 1976 to make them comparable with the 1973 categories. Given the importance of the distinction between contraceptively and noncontraceptively sterile women with respect to adoption behavior, we decided that the gain realized by adding the time variable have been more than offset by the loss of the greater analyti-

cal distinction of the fecundity status categories.
CONCLUSION
In this final section we discuss the implications of this research to the extent that they provide insights about the role of adoption as a means of family formation. Bachrach (1983a, p. 859) has noted that "the process of becoming a biological parent has been extensively documented . . . since the 1930s (but) other forms of parenthood (such as adoption) have received less attention." Our study was conducted in an attempt to fill this void.
The log-linear analyses reported in the preceding pages confirm Bachrach's earlier analysis based on the 1976 NSFG (1983a); they indicate that childless women, older women (between the ages of 35^4), and noncontraceptively sterile or subfecund women have much greater odds of having adopted a child than women with children, younger women (between the ages of 15 and 34), and women with other fecundity statuses. Also, the odds of women with one (biological) child having adopted a child are much higher than those of women with two (biological) children, and the odds of women with two children are higher than those of women with three or more children. The odds of having adopted a child decrease with increasing parity. Finally, noncontraceptively sterile and subfecund women have higher odds of having adopted a child than fecund women. What do these results tell us about adoption as a means of family formation?
Women who have adopted appear to be similar to women who have given birth to their own biological children on some characteristics, but dissimilar on

others. The odds of having biological children or having adopted a child decrease with parity. Childless women have the highest odds of becoming biological or adoptive mothers; high-parity women have the lowest odds of e i t h e r ^ having another biological child or an adopted child.
With respect to differences between biological and adoptive mothers, younger women are more likely to have biological children than older women, but older women are more likely to adopt children than younger women. Most often younger women strive to have biological children, but if after a number of years this strategy proves to be difficult or impossible, they often turn to adoption as an alternative means of family formation. However, these age differentials between biological and adoptive mothers may be narrowing as increasing numbers of women delay their childbearing. Bachrach (1983a, p. 863) reported that "the percentage of evermarried women 30 to 40 years of age who had never borne a child increased from 8.3% in 1970 to 13.1% in 1979." Moreover, as more women delay their biological childbearing, it is likely that more women will be unable to bear children, given the negative association between fecundity and age. These trends in delayed childbearing could lead to an increased reliance on adoption as an alternative means of family formation.
The most obvious difference be-^f tween biological and adoptive mothers is that the former are fecund when they give birth to the child, whereas the latter tend to be subfecund or sterile when they adopt. Of interest, however, is the fact that both contraceptively and noncontraceptively sterile women have higher odds of having adopted a child than fecund women. This suggests that
