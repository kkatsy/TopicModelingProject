Blood Group, Behavioral, and Morphological Differences Among Dizygotic Twins

The effects of genetic differences among siblings or dizygotic (DZ) twins are seldom studied. Although sibs share half of their genes on the average, the actual percentage of genes identical by descent varies around the mean of SO.
As two studies (Pakstis et al., 1972; Loehlin et al., 1974) have indicated, blood group markers may be useful as a rough index of the degree of genetic similarity between sibs or DZ co-twins. Independently segregating blood group markers are a sample of some 50 to 80 chromosome segments found to segregate independently at meiosis (Pakstis, 1975). Twelve to twenty blood group markers are, therefore, a fairly good sample of the segments that sibs or DZ co-twins may share.
Differences between sibs or DZ co-twins at blood group loci may be correlated with differences in physical growth, appearance, and behavior. The hypothesis to be tested is that sib pairs or co-twins who have fewer chromosomal differences, marked by blood group loci, also have more similar physical and behavioral characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS A sample of 145 pairs of DZ twins, on whom most of the information for this re-

port was available, were blood grouped, tested, photographed, and interviewed. The twins, aged 10 to 16, were drawn from both Black and white populations in the Philadelphia metropolitan area.
Blood samples were drawn and analyzed by the Minneapolis War Memorial Blood Bank. The following red cell and serum factors were used as markers in the analysis of co-twin differences: ABO, Rh, Kell, Duffy, MNS, AK, Hp, Tf, Gm, Gc, Cp, and INVi. If only one blood group difference was found, the laboratory tests were rerun to check for laboratory error. The loci at which the co-twins differed were counted for a simple index of genetic dissimilarity.
Five cognitive tests (Raven Standard Progressive Matrices, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Columbia Mental Maturity Scale, Revised Visual Retention Test, and a paired-associate learning task) and two personality measures (Junior Eysenck Personality Inventory and the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory) were administered as part of a larger battery of psychological, physical, and dental assessments. Stature, sitting height, weight, triceps skin-fold thickness, upper arm circumference, and

head length and breadth were measured with standard anthropométrie techniques. Skin reflectance was measured with a reflectometer, and skeletal age was rated from hand-wrist X-rays by the GreulickPyle method. All scores were standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Absolute difference scores between cotwins were calculated for all of the standardized measures.
Lateral and full-face head-to-shoulder black and white photographs were taken of each twin. The photographs were compiled by twin pairs. Eight psychology graduate students, Black and white, male and female, were asked to rate the zygosity of each pair on a scale from 1 to 6. A rating of 1 indicated certainty that the pair was monozygotic; 6 indicated certainty of dizygosity; and the intermediate numbers represented lesser degrees of certainty about the ratings. That is, ratings of 1, 2, or 3 were for monozygosity, with 1 being the most certain and 3 the least certain. Ratings on this scale, therefore, constitute an index of the similarity in physical appearance of co-twins.
During individual interviews, each of the co-twins was asked 4 questions: (1) "Do you and your twin look as alike as carbon copies?" (2) "Are you and your twin often mistaken for each other by friends and teachers?" (3) "Do you think that you are identical or fraternal twins?" and (4) "Do you and your twin dress alike? If so, how often?"
RESULTS
Significant correlations were found between the twins' perceived differences and the number of blood group differences. Those who said they did not look alike and were not mistaken for each other had different alíeles at more loci. Those DZ twins who believed they were MZ had

fewer blood group differences than those who correctly diagnosed their own zygosity (see Table 1).
Ratings of the twins' similarity in appearance from photographs confirmed the twins' own confusion. Those DZ pairs with the fewest blood group differences were most likely to be rated as monozygotic by the eight raters.
DZ twins with few blood group differences were no more likely to dress alike than those with many, but neither were all MZ twins any more likely to dress alike than all DZ pairs in this sample. Dressing alike did not correlate with similarity in appearance.
Of seven measures of physical traits, only three were significantly correlated with blood group differences, although none was negative. There is evidence, therefore, that some measures of physical traits, other than appearance, may also tend to be similar among DZ twins with few blood group differences.
Neither cognitive nor personality measures were consistently related to blood group differences. Two of the intellective tests were significantly correlated with blood groups--in opposite directions. None of the personality measures was significantly associated with blood group differences.
DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
While neither this study nor that of Loehlin et al. (1974) included the behavioral activity measures reported by Pakstis et al. (1972), this study does replicate the significant relationship between blood group and morphological differences reported in the Pakstis et al. study. The lack of consistent correlation between blood group and cognitive differences reported here supports the findings of Loehlin et al.

DZ twins and siblings who are genetically more similar have more similar physical appearance, as rated both by themselves and others. For physical and perhaps other traits, blood group markers appear to be a useful technique for the study of within-family genetic variability.
