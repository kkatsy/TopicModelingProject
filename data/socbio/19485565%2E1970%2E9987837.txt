When the conditioning of development is mentioned, genetic determinants and external environmental factors usually come to mind. Also, the role of certain factors, for which the name "paragenetic factors" has been proposed (Charzewska and Wolañski, 1964; Wolañski, 1967) is often mentioned. However, within the framework of the genetic conditioning of human development, as opposed to plant or animal breeding, too little importance is attributed to investigations on the effects of breeding. Even when investigating the effects of inbreeding--to which much attention has been devoted,-- it is often forgotten that the other side of the coin is the effect of crossbreeding. Crossbreeding may appear as augmentation of growth, so-called "high hybrid vigor" or heterosis. It may also have an effect contrary to heterosis, that is, depression of growth. When crossbreeding is viewed as disadvantageous in some structure, inbreeding is then considered favorable and may be called "homosis."
However, this latter problem has remained nearly unknown in man, apart from disadvantageous effects of "crossing" in connection with serological incompatibility.
In other traits, heterosis was implicated

as far back as the first decade of the current century. Dahlberg (1943) was the first to interpret the secular-trend mechanism as a product of this phenomenon. Also, in our earlier investigations we pointed out the role of heterosis in the secular trend, quoting three groups of mechanisms inducing the trend (Wolañski, 1967a, b).
In the present report we should like to treat in greater detail both the theoretical and statistical evidence for the indirect influence of migration (genetic flow) on the direction and intensity of the secular trend. This problem is of particular significance in Poland where, after World War II, some twelve million people were resettled. This movement was also accompanied by additional internal migrations over shorter distances. In Szczecin, for instance, these processes brought about the exchange of 97% of the population; in other areas, such as in villages of central and southern Poland, they amounted to only a few per cent (Kosiñski and Maryañski, 1968), and often involved more emigration than immigration.
In the present study we are primarily interested in continuously distributed quantitative traits. As we know, these traits are genetically determined by a great number of

cooperating genes exerting a weak effect.

MATERIAL AND METHOD

Genes of this type are susceptible to mutations, but the effects of the mutations are often not easily discernible. There is, however, a higher degree of consanguinity (inbreeding coefficient) where there are small populations, and populations which are to some extent isolated. Thus, there is greater opportunity for the meeting of blood relatives in any given marriage, and, hence, for the same homologous pair of genes in corresponding loci. This occurrence may cause higher mortality, the appearance of congenital malformations, and the like. Another effect of inbreeding may be weakening of biological vigor in such populations and a decrease in fertility (Tanaka, Yanase, and Furusho, 1964). I t might also simply reduce, or alter, the expression of some traits, and not only those conditioned by recessive genes (Penrose, 1955; Hülse, 1957).

The measurements were carried out by universally applied anthropométrie methods (Martin-Sailer, 1957) and statistical tests (Guilford, 1960).
The field investigations were carried out by the authors of the present study in November, 1966. The measurements were made only in the morning hours; the interview data were collected in the afternoon hours, with the parents of the children examined being summoned to the given schools or kindergartens. Reliable data were obtained for 850boys and 950girls, residents of Szczecin, aged 4, 8, and 16 years (within ± 1.5 months of their birthdays), and from their parents.
Between 1950 and 1960 the emigration coefficient in Szczecin province was 18.6 and that of immigration, 26.0 (Statistical Annual of the Polish Central Statistical

Crossbreeding has an effect contrary to Office, 1966).

the one described above: The diminution of the chance of occurrence of homologous genes and the prevalence of allelic sets in various pairs of loci diminishes the number of deaths brought about by the presence of recessive semi-lethal genes and the number of congenital malformations. Such effects are well known from an abundant literature, and in Poland we noted them recently in connection with the secular trend (Wolañski, 1967a). Heterosis is one of the possible effects of crossbreeding.

Cavalli-Sforza, Kimura, and Barrai (1966) pointed out the extent to which distance exerted an effect on the frequency of marriages contracted by persons inhabiting various localities in Parma, and Malécot (1948, 1955) showed mathematically the presence of differences in the degree of inbreeding according to the distance between the birthplaces of parents. Thus we distributed the families into groups according to the distance between the birthplaces of the mother and father of each child studied.

Of course, the more intense the migration (genetic flow) occurring in a given region, the more strongly the effect of crossbreeding can appear in the population as a whole, as we pointed out in the interpretation of the growth of body height in Szczecin children (Miçsowicz, 1964; Wolañski, 1967a).

In the materials quoted from Parma, 60% of the marriages exhibited distances of parental birthplaces up to 1.5 km., 75% up to 13 km., and 90% to 35 km. In our material from Szczecin, nearly 60% of the marriages were in the category of a distance of up to 300 km. between the birthplaces of

Heterosis in Man

The division into groups with various distances between the birthplace of the father and that of the mother was made according to the probable degree of contacts of potential spouses. A distance of 0 to 10 km. corresponds to frequent contacts of the inhabitants of a rural community, a large village, or a small town; distances of 11-50 km. correspond to somewhat less frequent contacts of inhabitants of one

environments in normal social conditions, both from the demographic and the cultural point of view and also from the genetic point of view, suggesting separate gene pools. We subdivided this latter group into two groups, one of 101 to 300 km. and one of 301 km. and over, because of the unusual migration in Szczecin after World War II. More than 40% of the marriages fell within this most distant group (Table 1).

1958 there are as many as 65% of marriages of this kind; and in 1962, 76% (Table 2). When 1945 is adopted as a starting point or year zero (which from the biological viewpoint is relatively true), the advances noted for 1945-50 amount to 41.0% for the fiveyear period, 24% for the period 1950-58 (or 15.0% in five years), and 11%for 195862 (or 13.8% in five years). It may be inferred from the above that, in practice, complete biological integration will take place around 1976-77. I t is an important piece of

During the period investigated, 1950 to 1962, the parents were increasingly younger at the time of birth of their children. In 1962 mothers averaged 0.5, and fathers 1.5 to 2 years younger than in 1950 (Table 3).
As far as marital selection is concerned, during the twelve years (1949-61) the mean age difference between parents decreased by two years (from 4.5 to 2.5 years, as shown in Table 3).

information that the population of city of 317,000 inhabitants in 1966 should undergo full biological integration (close to 100% of marriages within the city) in a single generation (based on the average age of parents in Szczecin at birth of offspring being about 27 years for women and 30 for men [see Table 3]).
The growth in the share of marriages contracted in Szczecin of parents with distant birthplaces is accompanied by a decrease in the frequency of marriages in which the birthplaces of the spouses were nearby. This points again to the fact that biological isolation can be measured indirectly by the distance of the birthplaces of spouses, or more

There is apparently no regularity in the variation of the parents' body height in the various age classes of children (Table 3). If, however, we calculate that the parents of these children experienced the period of World War II at the ages shown in Table 4, then it becomes clear that the smallest parental stature being shown in the parents of 8-year-old children is probably the result of the fact that these parents passed through the war period at the age of sexual maturation. As is known, aside from the age of 0.5 to 2 years (Wolañski, 1956, 1960; Massé, Moreigne, and Senecal, 1961), the period of sexual maturation is particularly susceptible to disturbances caused by food

In Table 5the stature of Szczecin children measured in 1960 is compared with that of Warsaw children studied in 1959 (Wolañski, 1962). During the investigations of 1959 and 1960, children of 16 years old of both sexes and 8-year-old girls from Warsaw were the

exceeds both that of Warsaw children of 1959 and Szczecin children of 1960 in all age classes investigated and for both sexes.
The 8-year-old children of the present study (the 4-year-old children were then not yet born) were 2 years old in 1960, and the 16-year-old ones were aged 10 at that time. These children, too, are now much taller than children of the same age in 1960 (by 2 to 3 cm., and in the group of 16-year-old boys by 6.5 cm., compared with data of Wolañski, 1965).
To a considerable extent we noted similar changes in chest circumference, excepting 4-year-old girls (Table 6).
In all age classes examined, in boys, and in 16-year-old girls, Quetelet's index exhibits changes in the direction of a "heavier" body build; only girls aged 4 are now slimmer than girls of the same age six years ago, and 8-year-old girls show no significant differences (Table 6).
ASSUMED EFFECT OF HETEROSIS
Tables 7 and 8 show the basic data relating to the problem of heterosis. They give the magnitudes of five investigated traits in children: stature, Quetelet's index (body weight in grams in proportion to body height in cm.), chest circumference measured at the height of xiphoidale, head circumference at metopion and opisthocranion, and the cephalic index (eu-eu: g-op X 100), according to the distance between birthplaces of parents.
Table 7 shows the marked trend toward an increase in body height in children in every age class and in the two sexes (this regularity does not occur in a clear-cut manner in 8-year-old girls and 16-year-old boys) as the distance between the birthplaces of the parents increases. A similar regularity may also be observed for the Quetelet index (for 4-year-old boys, and 8and 16-year-old girls this regularity is lacking). The greater the distance between the birthplaces of the parents, the heavier the body build characterizing their children. A

similar relationship exists for chest circumference, with the exception of 4-year-old boys and 16-year-old girls.
A regularity of this kind does not occur, however, for head circumference or shape (Table 8). For head circumference, this tendency occurs only in the group of 4-yearold boys; for head shape (cephalic index), contradictory trends of relationship are recorded in some cases in the various age classes and sexes, or there is no interrelationship.
In order to render still more objective the assessment of the investigated phenomenon --an assessment which is of decisive importance for the present study--the correlation coefficients were also calculated for the relation between the values of a given trait in children and the distance between the birthplaces of their parents. Table 9 contains these coefficients with the determination of their significance.
A positive correlation (using four field tables of correlation, because of skewness of the distance distributions) between the distance between the birthplaces of parents and the value of the trait in their children is present in 5 out of 6 groups. This correlation, however, is not present for head circumference nor cephalic index. Apart from 2 or 3 statistically nonsignificant coefficients, there are 2 cases of one-directional changes. Where the signs of the correlation coefficients vary in different subgroups, we are of the opinion that this ought to be interpreted as a lack of adequate evidence of regularities in the relationship in respect to head circumference and shape.
DISCUSSION
We investigated whether stature in children bore some relation to the body size or age of the parents. First we investigated whether traits such as stature, age, and the difference between the ages of the spouses are modified in a systematic direction with increasing distance between the birthplaces of spouses (Table 10 and 11). From the dis-

some data (Ounsted and Ounsted, 1966) pointing to the possibility of the mother transmitting some traits not as genetic determinants but by a certain constraint of the intrauterine environment.
It is of interest that Morton (1958) and Schork (1964) found no heterosis effect in newborn babies and small infants that they investigated. In particular, Morton, when investigating the body weight of children from endogamous and exogamous marriages, found no statistically significant differences in newborn infants and only a slight one in the ninth month of life in Japanese girls.

This view also seems to be confirmed in our investigations in the fact that the traits which at birth exhibit a lower level of development (as compared with the values attained by the adult subject) such as body height (34%), chest circumference (41%) exhibit a strong effect of heterosis (Table 12), while a trait such as head circumference

The same author found no significant difference between the body lengths of newborn infants from the two kinds of families, but found it in nine-month-old infants. He found no differences for chest and head circumference. Schork found no significant differences in infants two to four months old in body weight; for body length they are significant from the ninth month of age. For head and chest circumference there are no differences between newborn babies, and minor, but insignificant, differences appear in nine-month-old infants.
A number of authors, however, point out that the strength of genetically conditioned interrelations grows with age and appears in a statistically significant manner only at the time of sexual maturation. It does not appear in newborn infants, but is intensified only for some traits around the third or

in which a newborn infant has 62% of adult value, shows no effect of heterosis. The cephalic index grows until the seventh to tenth month of age by some eight units, and then it decreases systematically in the course of 1 to 2.5 years by some four units (Bayley, 1936; Terada and Hoshi, 1965), and afterwards--for the next forty years-- it diminishes by scarcely four to six units (Wolañski and Charzewska, 1967). Thus, both traits relating to the head are determined mainly during fetal development, and the two exhibit no heterosis effect.
In connection with the differences found in the occurrence of the heterosis effect between the various traits, it is worth remembering that the coefficient of variability (v) of the various traits is in general the smaller, the higher the degree of development of the trait attained at the time of

birth. Table 12 supplies the values for the eighth year of life, as then the variability is the smallest. This points either to more unified conditions of the intrauterine environment or to a weaker manifestation of genetic differences of the embryo in the prenatal period.
From the above it seems clear that the heterosis effect develops mainly in the postnatal period. It is therefore probably a phenomenon related to the process of the postnatal development itself--probably a higher sensitivity to external environment conditions.
From further analysis of our data (Table 9), it appears that increase in the absolute value of the traits investigated prevails in 4-year-old children of the two sexes and 16year-old boys, but only in one case in 16year-old girls. This may indicate that the heterosis effect is a developmental trait; that in certain periods it can grow, and then decrease. However, Hülse (1957), Nold (1963), and Schreider (1967), found the heterosis effect also in adult subjects. I t is therefore possible that the heterosis effect manifests itself on the one hand in the development rate and on the other in its duration. As we have only cross-sectional materials, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the differences observed manifested themselves in different ways according to the changing conditions of life, since these conditions were considerably modified in the course of the twelve years separating the youngest children from the oldest ones in our investigations.
The assumptions formulated here ought to be treated with great caution and to be considered as working hypotheses which require further meticulous investigation. They are, however, worth attention, since they coincide with observations from other fields of biology, for instance, "an artificial 1:1 mixture of parent mitochondria showed heterosis with respect to oxidation and phosphorylation" (McDaniel and Sarkis-

sian, 1966, p. 1640). If this phenomenon, discovered in plants, proves valid also for man it would mean that the heterosis effect represents a change in the developmental rate connected with a higher level of metabolism.2
Furthermore, animal hybrids are usually physiologically younger than subjects of pure races (Kol%taj, personal communication) which seems to be confirmed in man by the fact that in Cuba, Negro girls mature on the average at the age of 12.3 years and white girls at 12.4 years, while the mulatto girls mature at the age of 12.6 years (from Laska-Mierzejewska, 1965). This might imply differing sensitivity of heterozygous subjects to environmental stimuli. Tables 7 and 8 show that the above phenomenon is more common in boys than in girls; thus, the heterosis effect seems to show sex differences.
Table 7 points to the fact that the various distances between the birthplaces of the father and mother exert an unequal influence on the directional changes of traits in children. Thus, the observed regularity-- that properties of traits in children grow concomitantly with the increase in the distance between the birthplaces of the parents--is realized for the various age classes, sexes, and traits between the distance 0-10 and 11-50 km., and between 101-300 km. We shall come back to this problem in forthcoming investigations. Here, we want only to formulate a hypothetical assumption referring to results to date. We consider it probable, for example, that a difference between 0-10 and 11-50 km. subgroups can have a strong influence with respect to genetic differences, whereas considerable distance, such as between 101-300 and over 300 km., can influence differences in environmental conditions, in the different ecological niches of such distant populations.
2 There are some similar indications from research on animals by Kolataj (1966, 1967, unpublished).

To a considerable extent our material came from isolates, such as the prewar villages in regions beyond the Bug River in eastern Poland. As is known, the exchange of genes between pools which for a long time had remained in isolation can cause a profusion of variations and "material" for selection (Auerbach, 1965). It seems that the same may apply to the heterosis effect by itself, and therefore our results are particularly remarkable. This observation does not yet explain this phenomenon.
Repeated attempts at a genetic explanation of heterosis have been published. It is a common opinion that heterosis consists on the one hand in effects in connection with heterozygosis in relation to mutated recessive genes, and on the other in such a genetic mechanism as the interaction of dominance and superdominance (Stern, 1960; Auerbach, 1965; Kolatej, 1966, 1967).
Another mechanism recently pointed out is placental hypertrophy in the case of a heterogenetic relation between mother and fetus, as a result of a set of genes transmitted to the fetus by the father differing from the genes transmitted by the mother, or, in general, proper to the mother (Billington, 1964). In favor of this hypothesis are observations on mice, and observations that there is a correlation between the weight of the placenta and the size of the fetus in human beings also (Lesiñski, 1962; Ounsted and Ounsted, 1966).
As far as the genetic mechanisms of the heterosis effect are concerned, we cannot derive any new elements on the basis of our investigations. Our materials, however, throw some light on the hypothesis of "placental hypertrophy." Were this hypothesis true, the effect of heterosis would be the more strongly marked the stronger a given trait is developed (in relation to its magnitude in an adult subject) in the period of prenatal development. We found, quite on the contrary, that head circumference shows no heterosis effect, and this eSect is a minor

one for other traits in newborn babies and infants (Morton, 1958; Schull, 1962; Schork, 1964; Schull and Neel, 1965); instead, it grows with age. It seems therefore that the "placental hypertrophy" hypothesis should be rejected in the interpretation of heterosis. In respect to secular trend, body height grows in children concomitantly with increase in the distance between the birthplaces of their parents. At the same time, in Szczecin in recent years, the number of marriages has increased in which the spouses were bom at a great distance one from the other, and the number of marriages has decreased in which birthplaces are closely situated. The body height of Szczecin children has also risen in recent years. The same factor, heterosis, could therefore be one of the factors responsible for the increase in body height in Szczecin children.
CONCLUSIONS
In an investigation carried out on the newly forming population in Szczecin we obtained the following results.
In reference to demographic and biological changes: 1. Stature and chest circumference of Szcze-
cin children increased in the years 1960-66. 2. Between 1950 and 1962, for the age-
classes of children investigated by us, the percentage of parents who had married in Szczecin itself nearly doubled. This means a far-reaching biological integration of the population of this city. 3. In the years 1949-61 the proportion of marriages between persons born in regions distant from each other increased; marriages of those born in neighboring areas decreased. Thus, the percentage of marriages in which the partners had a low probability of being related in any way increased, and the inbreeding coefficient presumably dropped. 4. The coincidence of the above events supports the hypothesis that more distant crossings comprise one of the causes of the secular trend of body height and chest circumference in Szczecin children. 5. In 1962 mothers had children at an age some 0.5 years younger than in 1950; the fathers were some 1.5 to 2 years younger. 6. Parents who passed through their period
