ABSTRACT: Detailed 1977 national natality data are used to investigate social, demographic, and genetic effects on birthweight differentials. Analysis of birthweight differences among infants with white, black, and mixed black-white parents indicates that a portion of the observed weight differentials appear to be due to biologic factors. Infants with a black mother and father have the lowest mean birthweights, while infants with two white parents have the highest weights. Newborns with mixed-race parents have intermediate birthweight distributions. Multivariate analysis suggests that the effects of parental race on birthweight are not the result of maternal/obstetric differences among parents of the same or mixed race.

Compared with normal weight babies, low-birthweight infants are almost forty times as likely to die in the neonatal period (Shapiro et al., 1980). In addition to increasing the risk of mortality, low birthweight also increases morbidity and long-term developmental problems. The association between low birthweight and neurodevelopmental handicaps and congenital anomalies has also been well established. In addition, lower-respiratory-tract infections, learning disorders, behavior problems, as well as many other conditions are far more prevalent among low-birthweight infants than among those of normal weight at birth (Committee to Study the Prevention of Low Birthweight, 1985).
In spite of sharp reductions in newborn mortality during recent decades, the relative mortality among black infants has changed little since the turn of the century. The persistence of blackwhite infant mortality differentials has emerged as a major public health and policy issue and has produced intensified efforts to identify salient etiologi-

cal factors (Buehler et al., 1986). Increasingly, these investigations have focused on the role of low birthweight as a determinant of infant mortality in general and black-white differentials in particular. Although race-specific differentials in fetal development and optimum birthweight have been documented, their causes, and implications for public health policy have only recently received the systematic attention they deserve. A further understanding of these differences is needed to develop better operational measures of fetal maturity. The use of 2500 grams as the criterion to classify all newborns as low weight, for example, may be inappropriate if applied indiscriminately to infants of differing race or ethnicity. Better operational measures of low birthweight are needed, in part, because studies often use low birthweight as an indicator of inadequate prenatal care, poor nutrition, and the efficacy of maternal health programs. It is important to ascertain whether the rate of fetal development and optimum birthweight is affected by

a genetic component, since if this factor is important, its exclusion from analysis will simultaneously confound our understanding of both the causes of ethnic birthweight differentials as well as interventions necessary for reducing the incidence of babies born too soon or too small. This issue is of special importance because of the pervasive relationship between poverty and ethnicity.
This paper explores the relationships among ethnicity, birthweight, and selected social or demographic factors. Specifically, the paper compares the effect of factors such as father's educational attainment, mother's educational attainment, age, previous pregnancy history, and prenatal care, with the effects of a possible genetic component on observed differentials in birthweight in a national population.

Although thefindingsconcerning the association of maternal age and birth weight are mixed, the majority of studies report greater proportions of women at the extreme ends of childbearing age have low-birthweight infants than do women in the prime childbearing ages (Bouvier and van der Tak, 1976; Brass and Shapiro, 1982; Gortmaker, 1979; Kleinman, 1982; Ventura and Hendershot, 1984). The effect of maternal age upon birthweight appears to be partially due to factors that covary with maternal age, including socioeconomic status, marital status, parity, and prenatal care. For example, women under age 20 are more likely to have low-birthweight infants, but are also more likely to be primiparous, unmarried, and to delay prenatal care (Taffel, 1980;Ventura and Hendershot, 1984; Zuckerman et al., 1983).

the first trimester of pregnancy and continued until delivery, is associated with a lower risk of bearing low-birthweight infants (Kessner et al., 1973; Stickle and Ma, 1977; Showstack et al., 1984; People and Siegel, 1983).
Although race is strongly associated with birthweight (Kessel et al, 1984; Williams et al., 1986; Hemminski and Starfield, 1978; Morton et al., 1967; NCHS, 1984; NCHS, 1987; NCHS, 1988), race differentials are not clearly understood. Several factors have been suggested as contributing to the differentials, including socioeconomic status (Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977;Chez et al., 1976; Gortmaker, 1977; Garn et al., 1977; Hemminski and Starfield, 1978), maternal age, parity, wedlock status (Bross and Shapiro, 1982; Eisner et al., 1979; Gortmaker, 1979; Kehrer and Wolin, 1979; Kleinman, 1982), and pregnancy weight gain, height, and prepregnancy weight (Goldstein, 1981; Hardy and Mellitis, 1977;Levkoff et al., 1982; Taffel and Keppel, 1982).
Based on a large prospective study of perinatal mortality, Naeye (1979) found a higher incidence of premature rupture of fetal membrane, placental growth retardation, amniotic fluid infections, and congenital malformations among black fetuses and neonates. That these differences are nonracial in origin is suggested by the fact that they were either reduced or eliminated when controls for mother's prepregnancy weight and antenatal care were employed.
Several studies have suggested that observed birth weight differentials are a consequence of both social-demographic and biological factors. Numerous studies report that while controls for various socioeconomic and demographic factors reduced the incidence of low birthweight, they did not eliminate it (Naylor and Myrianthopoulos (1967;

Gara et al., 1977). Morton (1955) and Carlson (1984), as well as Seltzer and Mayer (1966), argue that about one-half of the observed differentials among diverse ethnic or racial groups is due to social and environmental factors, while the remaining one-half is biologic in origin. Naylor and Myrianthopoulos (1967) have also suggested that race may be a polygenetic variable affecting birthweight. Maternal weight and height, genetic genomes, maternal ethnic origin, and differential rates of fetal development are among the biologic factors considered to impact infant birthweight. Although the mother's height appears to be the primary biologic determinant of birthweight, a similar but weaker association is obtained between the mother's prepregnancy weight and birthweight.
Numerous studies suggest that birthweight has a genetic component which is maternal in origin (Morton et al., 1967; Morton, 1955; Seltzer and Mayer, 1966). Ounstedt (1978) argues that observed birthweight differentials are partly determined by maternal genomes. Johnson and Inglis (1974) found that the sisters of women who had delivered a low-weight infant were significantly more likely to have a low-weight baby than were sisters-in-law. Grossman and colleagues (1974) reported that maternal ethnic origin was associated with significant birthweight differentials, while a follow-up study of paternal origin (Handlesman et al., 1975) revealed no significant effects on infant birthweight.
Several studies demonstrate that both optimum birthweight--the weight associated with lowest infant mortality--and mean gestational-agespecific birthweight are different for black and white newborns (Garn et al., 1977; Wilcox and Russell, 1983, 1985;

16

Benkin et al., 1986). A study of birthweight among ethnic populations in Hawaii reported that the optimum weight ranged from 3,678 grams for whites to 3,358 grams for Filipinos and suggested that low birthweight for these populations be defined as 2,500 grams and 2,200 grams respectively (Morton et al., 1967). Differences for other ethnic populations in the United States have been documented for Asian Americans (NCHS, 1984), American Indians and Alaskan Natives (NCHS, 1987), and Hispanics (NCHS, 1988). These studies show that the proportion of births under 2,500 grams for American Indians, Alaskan Natives, and Hispanics are similar to those for other whites, despite their shorter mean gestational periods and tendency to be concentrated in obstetric categories associated with low birthweight--the young and less educated, those who receive fewer prenatal visits, and those who start prenatal care late in the pregnancy. Such studies suggest that genetic factors are partly responsible for differential rates of fetal development.
There is evidence that fetal development proceeds at different rates for blacks and whites (Garn et al., 1977; Morton et al., 1967;Wilcox and Russell, 1983). These studies find that black infants develop at a more rapid pace than whites during the first 36 weeks of gestation. An analysis of California data suggests that fetal development may proceed at a different rate for various race groups as evidenced by higher mortality rates for black than white newborn populations with identical birthweight distributions (Binken et al., 1985). Wilcox and Russell (1986) arrive at similar conclusions using North Carolina data. These investigations suggest that while the lower birthweight of nonwhites may

reflect prior genetic or nutritional factors, they do not necessarily indicate retarded fetal development. A significant implication of such studies is that the use of 2,500 grams as a single proxy measure of retarded fetal development or prematurity may be inappropriate for different race or ethnic groups and may obscure the effects of other factors.
A review of past research suggests that although the disparity in birthweight distribution of blacks and whites is well documented, there is a lack of concensus concerning the causes of this differential and a need for research which examines both types of factors simultaneously. This paper contributes to the literature on birthweight differentials by examining the effects of selected social, demographic, and genetic factors on birthweight within a multivariate framework.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data used in this analysis are individual birth records from the 1977 detailed natalityfilesfor the United States, consisting of approximately 2.8 million records. The analysis is restricted to birth records of singleton infants containing race information on both parents. Four race categories are used: white mother and white father, black mother and black father, black mother and white father, and white mother and black father. This classification is more specific than that used by the National Center for Health Statistics and hence will yield greater detail than is typically available from NCHS publications.
NCHS designates the newborn's race according to the race of the parent(s). If one parent is white, the child is assigned the other parent's race or national origin. When neither parent is white, the

In addition, births to parents other than whites andblacksare excluded from the analysis because of substantial heterogeneity of the groups and the fact that the number of mixedrace births among these other race categories yield numbers too small for reliable analysis.
The other variables used in theanalysis include gestational age at birth, infant sex, mother's live-birth order, mother's age, month prenatal care started, number of prenatal visits, mother's education, father's education,number of previous fetal deaths, gestational age at birth andinfant birthweight.

This was necessary because the only appropriate way to handle missing data in theSPSSx regression procedure is the list-wise deletion of cases. The elimination of records from the thirteen nonrecording states produced a weighted extract file of 1,326,620 single births to black and white parents.

RESULTS
Table 1shows the mean birthweight, weight differentials, number of births, and standard deviations for single births for each of the four race categories. Compared with white mothers and white fathers, newborns with other combinations of parental race have a lower mean birthweight. Black mothers deliver infants of lowest weight, irrespective of the father's race. In addition, differences in mean birthweight according to mother's race (167 grams and 148 grams) are greater than those for father's race (99grams and80 grams).
The effects of parental race on birthweight are also evident in Figure 1

and Figure 2, which show the birthweight distributions of infants according toparental race. Bothfiguresindicate that newborns with parents ofthe same race have the most distinctive birthweight characteristics, while the offspring of parents of mixed race form intermediate distributions. As wasseen earlier, Figure 1 shows that infants of white parents have the heaviest birthweights, while infants of blackparents have the lightest weights. Babiesof white mothers and black fathers have heavier weights than those with black mothers and white fathers. Figure 2 is the probit of the cumulative birthweight distributions andprovides greater detail in thetails of the distribution than istrue of an ogive based on per cents. The cumulative probit function clearly shows the distinctive weight patterns between newborn with white and black mothers.

fant than does the father's. The largest differences occur between infants whose parents are of the same race, either both black or both white, while the proportions of low-birthweight newborns of mixed-race parents are fairly similar to each other.
The suggestion from past research that fetal development may proceed at a different pace for whites and blacks is considered in Table 3, which shows mean birthweight by parental race and the length of gestation. The data in Table 3 clearly show that infants of black parents have the lowest mean birthweight in each gestational age group and that infants of white parents have the highest mean weight at gestational ages above 37 weeks. The most striking difference observed among infants born at 37weeks gestation or lessis the higher mean birthweight among babies with a black mother and white father (2,711 grams), resulting in a mean birthweight 197 grams heavier than babies of white parents, and a 269gram advantage over babies whose parents are both black. However, it should be noted that the numbers of parents of mixed race in general, and especially the category of white father and black mother, are relatively small.
There are no consistent differentials among infants with gestation periods of 38 to 39 weeks or 40 to 41 weeks. However, large differences which are consistent with the mean weight differentials seen in Table 1 are observed for gestations of 42 weeks or more as well as for births with missing gestation data. Other patterns in Table 3 are less consistent, but generally the effects of mother's race on mean weight appear to exceed those of father's race.

The data in Tables 1-3 and Figure 1 lend credence to the hypothesis that birth weight is affected by parental race, with mother's race generally having a larger effect on infant birth weight than race of father. The data also lend support to the idea that there may be differences in the rate of fetal development of blacks and whites, especially in thefirst 36 weeks of gestation.
As noted earlier, social and demographic factors play an important role in birth weight differentials. Table 4 presents information for a series of maternal/obstetric indicators which are available from the detailed natalityfiles for black and white parents of the same and mixed race. Table 4 indicates that social and demographic differences are largest for infants with a white mother and father relative to all others, but the differences among the remaining combinations are fairly small. For example, the mean maternal age for the category white mothers and white fathers is nearly one year higher than for white mother and black father, and about onehalf a year higher than the combination black mother and black fathers. A similar pattern occurs for all other variables.
In general, the differences observed in Table 4 indicate that newborns with white parents have the most favorable maternal/obstetric characteristics, while infants with a black mother have the least favorable characteristics, irrespective of the father's race. These differences, although small, are of special interest for the items which indicate access to prenatal care. On average, prenatal care among women in the white mother and white father category was initiated about two weeks earlier than for other parental combinations, and this group

of women also had an average of one to two more prenatal visits than other women.
Two variables shown in Table 4 display patterns which are noteworthy. Although slight, differences in the mean length of gestation are consistent with birthweight differences and suggest a larger maternal effect. The difference in mean length of gestation between white and black mothers is approximately 0.60 weeks, while paternal differences are about one-third to one-half as large. Differences in the sex-ratio show a small maternal effect relative to the parental effect. These differences are consistent with a recent investigation which found

the primary sex ratio to be predominantly paternal in origin (Khoury et al., 1986).
In order to pursue the issue of a possible maternal genome effect on birthweight, a multiple regression analysis was performed with birthweight as the dependent variable. The independent variables used in this part of the analysis consist of the items shown in Table 4. In addition, three binary dummy variables were employed for parents of mixed race. The first dummy is for the combination of a black father and white mother, the second is for the combination of a black father and white mother, the second is for the combination of a

The model based on the log ofbirth weight yielded a slightly better fit (R2 = 0.25) primarily because of a slight departure from linearity forbirth weight and the length of gestation among extreme gestation periods (> 46 weeks). Because theeffects of the dummy variables forrace are intuitively simpler to interpret forbirth weight in its standard, these results are presented in Table5. In addition tothe results presented, separate models were obtained forfirst,second, and third and higher birth orders. These models were essentially the same and are not presented. Also,first-orderinteractions between the dummy variables forrace and all other independent variables were included inthe model. Two ofthe 36first-orderinteraction terms barely achieved statistical significance (p =s 0.05) and were not included inthe model because they were oflittle substantive importance.

decrement of 78.3 grams is observed for the combination of black mother and white father, and a decrement of 46.1 grams is seen for white mother and black father. Comparison of the coefficients for the parental race combinations lends support to the hypothesis that maternal ethnic origin has more of an effect on infant birthweight than paternal ethnic origin.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The results of this analysis support both the theoretical propositions and empirical results from other studies which have suggested that birthweight differentials are the result of both a genetic component and social and demographic factors. Although the amount of variance in birthweight attributable to the regression model is modest, the combination of a black mother and father produces a birthweight decrement of 142.3grams, or 57 per cent of the total observed black-white difference among the study population. This value is consistent with previous research that reported that approximately one-half of the black-white birthweight differential is due to genetic factors.
Other results are also consistent with prior research on the effects of social and demographic factors on infant birthweight. Increased birthweight is associated with higher order parity, more frequent prenatal visits, higher maternal age, and higher parental education, while a decrease in birthweight is associated with greater numbers of fetal deaths, later initiation of prenatal care, and having black parent(s).
There are several implications of the findings reported here. First, different ethnic classification schemes can produce different estimates of the preva-

lence of low birthweight. The estimate of the proportion of black infants of low birthweight using the race criteria employed by NCHS may be lower than that obtained if the race criteria is a combination of the race of both parents. This study has shown that newborns with one white parent generally have higher mean birthweights than newborns with black parents. This finding suggests that grouping infants of racially-mixed parents into the black category will yield an artificially low proportion of lowbirthweight infants for the black population. The extent of the underestimate will depend on the proportion of black infants with a white parent. In addition, such underestimates may vary by geographic area, since the incidence of mixed-race marriages may vary from one location to another. Substantial distortions are possible in states where the likelihood of interracial marriage is higher. In general, states that have a large black population will experience less distortion than will states where the number of blacks is small. In this context, it is significant to note that the likelihood of interracial marriage is substantially higher in the states where there are relatively smaller black populations. The correlation between the per cent of births to mixed-race couples and the log of the per cent of the state's population which is black is -0.86.
At the national level, the per cent of births classified as low weight increases from 11.7 using the NCHS classification of race to 12.0 when the more restrictive definition (both parents are black) is used. This modest difference represents an additional 1,093 births. The total effect of including parents of mixed race is slight because the proportion of mixed race parents is fairly small (5.4 per cent). However, when individual states are
