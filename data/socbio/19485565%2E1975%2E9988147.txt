Americans have today adopted a nearly universal norm of fertility control in one form or another (Westoff and Ryder, 1969). There has been a steady increase in recent years in positive attitudes toward contraceptive practice as well as in the actual use of birth control techniques. This increase has occurred among all segments of the population, affecting a gradual contraction in differentials by such sociocultural categories as education and religion (Westoff and Bumpass, 1973). Recent discussions of population policy have been directed specifically at the implications of this "revolution" in contraceptive behavior, especially as it may relate to the question of unwanted fertility and, ultimately, to the rate of population growth (see, for example, Bumpass and Westoff, 1970Ô; Jaffe, 1971; and Commission on Population Growth and the American Future, 1972).
Involved in any discussion of "perfect contraceptive" populations is the dual issue of means versus motives. The widespread and rapid adoption of the contraceptive pill by millions of American women has served to focus attention on the potential efficacy of an improved contraceptive technology for the reduction or virtual elimination of

unwanted or unplanned births. Yet throughout the 1960's, long after the ready availability of the pill and other effective means of contraception, large numbers of American women reported unwanted births. Between 1960 and 1965, for example, 20 per cent of all births were reported as unwanted (Bumpass and Westoff, 1970a). Between 1965 and 1970, according to the 1970 National Fertility Study, nearly half of all births were unplanned and fully 15 per cent were reported as never wanted (Commission on Population Growth and the American Future, 1972). Thus, presumably as many as 2.65 million births over the latter five-year period would not have occurred had couples been able to realize their fertility preferences. We should also bear in mind that the measures of unwanted fertility used in making these estimates were generally on the conservative side, due largely to the rationalization involved in reporting unwanted births (Bumpass and Westoff, 1970a).
While Americans have overwhelmingly adopted family planning as a prevailing norm, the above data clearly suggest that the efficacy of individual couples in realizing their reproductive goals is still highly variant. In other words, the widespread

availability of highly effective contraceptives has not yet been translated into a comparably high degree of fertility control. Thus, the question of motivation, along with that of technological means, must be raised as a critical issue for both research and public policy. We know that unwanted fertility occurs most frequently among persons with the lowest levels of education and income, and that most unwanted fertility occurs among women in their later years of childbearing (Commission on Population Growth and the American Future, 1972). What we do not know is why these women have such high rates of unwanted fertility and why there is a persistent factor of "excess" fertility even among the most highly educated women in our society. The present research is directed toward examining some suggestive leads for answering these questions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Most of what we know about the incidence of unwanted fertility has been derived from responses to questions about the circumstances of pregnancies that occurred at some point in the past. Reliable reports are thus difficult to obtain, since the admission of unwanted births may imply unfavorable connotations about the parents as well as the child. Rationalization, in other words, is probably fairly common.
An alternative to ex post facto data collection procedures would be to ascertain the fertility intentions of women at different parity levels and ages, including the intention not to have any more children, and then to collect subsequent fertility data as a way of measuring the efficacy of fertility control over a given period of time.1
1 The best known research utilizing such a longitudinal design is the Princeton Fertility Study. The authors of the final volume in this project report selected data on subsequent fertility among women who had indicated earlier preferences for no additional children. By and

Such data were initially collected on a series of fertility-related issues from a sample of Toledo, Ohio mothers in 1963, and subsequent data from the same sample, on the same issues, in 1971. While the original study was not designed specifically to measure correlates of unwanted fertility, several dimensions of the two data sets permit an examination of fertility control over the eight-year interval.
The original sample for the collection of data in 1963 was drawn from a completed list of Toledo, Ohio women who had given birth to a child during 1962. The questionnaires, consisting of a wide variety of attitudinal and census-type questions, were returned by 68 per cent of the sampled mothers. Seven hundred of these respondents were white Protestants and Catholics and this subsample formed the basis for our subsequent collection of data in 1971. Through various procedures, current addresses were verified for 408 of the 1963 respondents. We were eventually successful in obtaining follow-up data in 1971 from 336 subjects, or 82 per cent of the women for whom current addresses could be determined. The longitudinal study, then, is based on data collected from 47 per cent of the respondents included in the original 1963 survey.2
. Our sampling procedure assured the inclusion of women with proven fecundity
large, however, no significant associations of fertility-planning success with personality characteristics were found. See L. L. Bumpass and C. F. Westoff, 1970a.
2 Drawing upon the 1963 data, a systematic comparison of respondents and unlocated subjects was made on each of the alienation, socioeconomic, and demographic variables. Of these numerous comparisons, only wife's education and religion were statistically differentiated at the 0.05 level. Protestants and those with less than a highschool education were somewhat over-represented among unlocated subjects. In addition to the lack of forwarding addresses, our impression is that such factors as divorce, remarriage, residential dislocations through urban renewal projects, and death were the primary conditions distinguishing unlocated from located subjects.

and permitted a test for possible fertility correlates operative during the childbearing years. Thus, the sample cuts across all ages and marital durations and includes parity levels from one to sixteen. While our sample includes only women with proven fecundity, we recognize that differential subfecundity, especially among women past age 35, may be a contributing factor to differential fertility among our subjects. The eight-year interval between 1963 and 1971 covers a span of mean ages for our subjects from about 27 to 34 and thus focuses on fertility correlates among women in the later years of childbearing, where the greatest incidence of unwanted fertility occurs. Since the average marital duration for our subjects in 1963 was about seven years, the 1971 follow-up provides us with subjects characterized by a mean marital duration of between 14 and IS years. Finally, only women with marriages uninterrupted by death or divorce between 1963 and 1971 are included in the present study.
It also seems important to note that our sampling procedure biased our obtained data in the direction of high fertility subjects. Women characterized by a high degree of fertility control and small families had a lower probability of being selected for our initial study. By using the 1963 respondents as the sample base for our present research, a greater range of fertility variation is thereby obtained. Women who have exhibited a high degree of fertility control and successfully terminated their childbearing, as well as women who have experienced continued fertility beyond the age and marital duration of completed family size for most women, are included in the 1971 data.
RESULTS
We have listed data on a series of fertility and attitudinal variables by religion, education, and occupation, shown in Table

1. These data provide an overview of the obtained differentials by several customary sociocultural categories and indicate the generally high fertility of our particular sample. The differentials by mean number of children born between 1963 and 1971, as well as average family size in 1971, are in the usual and expected directions. Nonetheless, the differentials by most recent fertility (1963-71) are much smaller than those by overall fertility in 1971, reflecting the decreasing rate of childbearing which accompanies the increasing age and marital duration of our subjects.
The data on reported ideal family size in 1963 and 1971 show that by 1971 the women in our sample have invariably exceeded their own notions of what constitutes an ideal family size. Moreover, while their fertility continued to increase between 1963 and 1971, the reported ideal family size was drastically reduced over this same time period. Other research has suggested that the use of ideal family size as a basis for determining unwanted fertility tends to be a conservative criterion, since ideal family size generally exceeds the number of children subjects desire for themselves or that they intend to have (Ryder and Westoff, 1969). To the extent that such relationships between ideal, desired, and intended fertility are applicable to our subjects, the striking disparities between ideal and actual fertility in 1971, shown in Table 1, are indicative of a significant incidence of unplanned and unwanted fertility. We shall return to this point in subsequent tables.
If unwanted fertility does indeed constitute an important amount of the overall fertility for our sample, it seems unlikely that it is due to unfavorable attitudes toward family planning. Regardless of religion, education, or occupational status, roughly 90 per cent of our respondents reported approval of doing something to limit the number and spacing of preg-

nancies. However, the data on use of birth control before the first pregnancy, and on regular use of contraception, provide much sharper differentials by the sociocultural categories. Catholics, women with the least education, and women married to husbands in manual occupations all reported less use of birth control before the first pregnancy and.less regular use overall than did Protestants, more highly educated women, and women married to men in nonmanual occupations.
Accidental pregnancies (defined as pregnancies which began "while using some method to prevent pregnancy") were reported by about 35 per cent of our sample, and with the exception of college-educated women there is little difference between the percentages by religion, education, or occupation. However, somewhat greater differentials are obtained within these same categories in the percentages of women reporting they really wanted their last child. The range of percentages within theeducation category, from only 56 per cent for grade school wives to 73 per cent forcol-

lege-educated women, is particularly striking.
In summary, Table 1 shows a concomitant pattern of increasing fertility anddecreasing ideal family size between 1963and 1971 for women in our sample. We also see a uniformly high acceptance of contraceptive use coupled with relatively lowpercentages of actual use on a regular basis. Nearly 35 per cent of the women reported accidental pregnancies while using some method to prevent pregnancy, and considerably less than three-fourths of our sample reported really wanting their last child, regardless of parity. Subsequent tables are directed at providing us with insights into selected socio-psychological correlates ofthe family-forming process, with special attention to the issue of unwanted fertility.
Several recent studies have indicated the potential relevancy of alienation theory to fertility and family planning behavior. The alienation dimensions of meaninglessness, normlessness, powerlessness, and social isolation have been found to differentiate such variables as age at marriage and family

size (Groat and Neal, 1967, 1973; Neal and Groat, 1970), contraceptive practice (Bauman and Udry, 1972), and planning for the last child (Bullough, 1972). Rainwater (1960) was the first to elaborate a broad, though implicit, perspective of alienation theory at it may relate to fertility behavior. For example, he emphasized that many women may in a sense be "victimized" by a high fertility which stems from particular combinations of perceptions and motivations. Thus, highly alienated women may be less successful in controlling their fertility, and larger families may be due in part to unplanned and unwanted pregnancies generated by a life-style of aimlessness and drift. In other words, some minimal sense of stability and trust in the predictability of future events seems essential to consistent and effective family planning. The kind of world view implied by this rationale is precisely what is most lacking among highly alienated persons.
Seeman's (1959) well-known definition of alienation has emphasized the multidimensionality of the concept into attitude clusters. Thus, meaninglessness (perceived complexity and chaos), powerlessness (subjectively-held probabilities for controlling events), normlessness (perceived necessity of socially disapproved conduct for goal attainment), and social isolation (the experience of social cleavage) have been operationalized as separate alienation dimensions.3 Using these multiple indicators of alienation, previously reported findings (Groat and Neal, 1967) provided general
3 Each of the four alienation scales was organized in a Likert format and contained empirical referents to events in the broader society. None of the items contained specific referents to alienation within the family. The powerlessness, meaninglessness, and normlessness scales particularly emphasized the themes of alienation in connection with political and economic events. The isolation scale concentrated on feeling of impersonality and loneliness in relations with others. Copies of the scales are available upon request.

support for the view that conditions of alienation are associated with variations in family size. Subsequently, by means of scalogram analysis (Stouffer et al., 19S2), it was possible for us to construct empirical profiles of alienation by drawing upon the multiple scores derivable from the individual powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, and social isolation scales. The results of this procedure yielded even betr ter predictive results than those obtained by use of the separate dimensions alone (Neal and Groat, 1970; Groat and Neal, 1973).
Table 2 shows the separate alienation profiles, constructed from 1963 alienation scores, for Protestants and Catholics. The separation of subjects by religion was made, first, because the specific relationships between kinds of alienation and fertility varied by religion; and secondly, because the interrelationships of alienation components were varied between Protestants and Catholics. Thus, an identifiable basis for unity across alienation scales is a function of the cohesion among variables in the specific populations being studied. Since social isolation among Catholics was related to fertility in an anomalous pattern by comparison with other variables, it was obviously tapping a separate aspect of the alienation problem. For this reason, isolation was eliminated from our scalogram analysis of Catholic subjects.
Table 2 shows that each of our three fertility measures relates to alienation profiles in the expected direction. Whether we use the mean number of children over a common time interval (1963 to 1971), the total number of children in 1971, or the extreme case of having five or more children, the results generally indicate that the higher the level of alienation, the higher the level of fertility. This finding applies to Catholics as well as to Protestants. For example, beween 1963 and 19,71, Protes-

family size at that time. By determining subsequent childbearing for those who indicated in 1963 that "my family is just about the right size," we are provided with an additional indicator of unsuccessful fertility control. We recognize that this measure of fertility intentions is indirect and that some women maysimply have changed their minds at a later point in time. Nonetheless, by concentrating on women who reported family size in 1963 as "about right," we may draw some cautious inferences, especially since the results corroborate those obtained by dealing with ideal family size. These data are shown in Table 4 for both Protestants and Catholics and suggest the importance of alienation profiles in accounting for excess fertility.
Table 4 indicates that among both Protestants and Catholics those mothers who scored highest in 1963 alienation had the greatest amount of additional fertility over the next eight years. Thus, while a factor of "unwanted" fertility is undoubtedly present among both high and low alienation

women, the probabilities of having additional children were considerably greater for high than for low alienation subjects. The data on age and marital duration suggest that these fertility differences are not due to demographic factors alone.
Consistent with the general trend of our data, the ideal family size for this subsample sharply declined between 1963 and 1971. Disparities between actual and ideal family size in 1971,however, are greater for women in the high than in the low alienation profiles, among both Protestants and Catholics. The maximum obtained disparity between actual parity and ideal family size is for Catholics high in alienation. Catholics who regarded their families as "just about the right size" in 1963and who scored high on alienation profiles were characterized by an actual parity of 5.64 children in 1971 in contrast to an ideal family size of 3.50. In this special case, the excess of fertility over ideal family size was an average of 2.14 children.

measures. This finding suggests again that timing of contraceptive use rather than contraceptive failure itself is most responsible for fertility differences by levels of alienation. In other words, the highly alienated women may be as successful with contraception as those low in alienation, when in fact they are using contraception. But regularity of use, and especially timing of use, are different matters. Looking at the differences by alienation in number of pregnancies after which birth control was first practiced is quite revealing. Protestant mothers in the highest alienation category began using birth control after an average of almost two and. a half children, in contrast with averages of .1.35, 1.06, and 1.12 children for women in each of the three successive profiles, respectively.
Comparable data for the Catholics in our sample are given in Table 6, and the overall pattern is similar to that for Protestants. The subsequent fertility of Catholic women who in 1963 were either undecided or did not want additional children is clearly differentiated by the alienation profiles. The most highly alienated Catholics, for example, had nearly twice as many children over the eight-year interval as women in the lowest alienation profiles (0.92 versus 0.50, respectively). Total fertility in 1971 follows a slightly more irregular pattern. While women in the three highest alienation profiles have average family sizes of 6.15, 5.22, and 4.65, respectively, the least alienated women have a mean family size of 5.50. This departure from the hypothesized pattern is probably due to the tendencies of middle-class, welleducated Catholic women to exhibit higher fertility and greater conformity to church norms on contraception than do their less well-educated counterparts. That is, to the extent that these low-alienation Catholics are middle-class (see Table 3), the data in Table 6 probably reflect the usual U-shaped

pattern of fertility often reported for Catholics by socioeconomic indicators.
In addition, and more important to our inferences about unwanted fertility, the data on age and marital duration suggest that the most highly alienated Catholics also have the greatest probabilities for additional fertility. While the data do not form a consistent pattern across the alienation profiles, the extremes do show that women high in alienation are younger and have been married a shorter time than women low in alienation.
Like Protestants, Catholic women reported much lower ideal family sizes in 1971 than in 1963. But unlike Protestant wives, the least alienated Catholics reported the highest average ideal family size in both years. Nonetheless, the greatest disparities between actual and ideal fertility are found in the two highest profiles, where actual 1971 fertility exceeds 1971 ideal family size by 2.39 and 1.68 children in profiles 3 and 2, respectively.
The data on contraceptive use are somewhat anomalous. All of the low-alienated Catholics reported some use of birth control, but not very regularly and not, as a group, before the first pregnancy. And there are virtually no differences by alienation in the reported incidence of accidental pregnancy while using some method of birth control. However, the timing of contraceptive use, shown by the data on mean number of pregnancies after which birth control was first practiced, is indeed differentiated by the alienation profiles. Women in the two highest profiles (3, 2) show initial birth control use only after 3.69 and 3.19 pregnancies, respectively, in contrast to 2.81 and 3.27 pregnancies for the low-alienation women. Again, the lowest alienation profile indicates a reversal of the overall pattern.
The 130 women, taken alone, who reported in 1963 that they wanted no more children constitute an additional and more

conservative basis for testing our hypothesis regarding unwanted fertility. Table 7 lists four separate measures of subsequent fertility, by each of the alienation profiles, for Protestants and Catholics separately. Looking at Protestants first, we note that whether by percentages with two or more or one or more children, the alienation profiles uniformly discriminate subsequent fertility in the expected direction. The pattern for Catholics is approximately the same, although no important differentials are obtained for the highest fertility category (two or more children). For both religious groups, however, percentages of women with no additional children and average number of children since 1963 follow the hypothesized pattern. That is, women low in alienation in 1963 were considerably more successful in controlling their subsequent fertility than were women in the higher alienation categories.
Finally, Table 7 also lists data which permit review of another potentially important consideration in fertility research. In Rainwater's discussion (1960, pp. 167168) of working class fertility, he emphasizes the effect on fertility of the relatively stable and enduring quality of world views which "do not admit such foreign elements as conscious planning and emotion laden contraceptive practices." To partially test this notion, again using only women who specifically indicated in 1963 that they wanted no more children, we divided our subjects with stable alienation scores over the eight-year time interval by levels of alienation into stable high and stable low groups. Women with high alienation scores in both 1963 and 1971 should, by our hypothesis, be characterized by a higher incidence of unwanted pregnancy than those who scored low in alienation at both points in time.
The data in Table 7 provide very strong support for this hypothesis. By each of

several measures of subsequent fertility, and for each of the separate dimensions of alienation within the religion categories, we find that women consistently low in alienation over a period of eight years experienced the greatest degree of family planning efficacy. By contrast, the fertility of women with high alienation scores at the two points in time (stable high) invariably experienced higher subsequent fertility. Overall, the 1963-71 fertility of the high alienation women is well over twice as high as that for women with consistently low alienation scores. And, we should reiterate, all women in this sample expressed the indentical intention in 1963 of having no additional children. Thus, Rainwater may well be correct in arguing that high fertility, and particularly unwanted fertility, partially derives from alienated aspects of a relatively consistent and deeply-imbedded world view.
DISCUSSION
As we have operationalized our alienation variables, the relationships between high alienation and high fertility should by the theory under review be understood as a differential capacity for control-relevant behavior of many kinds. Essentially, our interest has been to identify social-psychological variables empirically correlated with information-retention, planning, and the recognition of future consequences of conduct. Considerable research has pointed to alienation dimensions as key factors in understanding variations among populations in their potentials for long-range planning and in their capacities for producing the kinds of outcomes they desire for themselves and for others.
Specifically, women high in alienation may in a sense be victimized by a higher probability of having unwanted pregnancies than women low in alienation. From this perspective, high alienation may be concomitant with "a sense of [at most] going
