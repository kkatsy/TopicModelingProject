ABSTRACT: While numerous studies have reported differential assortative mating coefficients for personality traits, little research has centered on cross-sample comparisons to determine their degree of generalizability. The present investigation examines the assortative mating coefficients for scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) from five separate studies. An examination of these patterns of significant coefficients offers little support for this crosssample generalizability. No significant correlations resulted between these studies in their coefficients, even when the unreliability of the different measures was controlled. It is concluded that there is little evidence to support statements of differential importance in assortment for personality variables beyond the sample under investigation.

Human assortative mating (homogamy) has been reported in research since the beginning of the century (e.g., Pearson and Lee, 1903). Recent reviews of this research have noted that assortment is evident for a variety of characteristics including intelligence, personality, physical traits, religion, psychiatric disorders, and family structure (Epstein and Guttman, 1984; Thiessen and Gregg, 1980; Vandenberg, 1972). The question remains, however, as to what are the more important of these characteristics.
In their review, Thiessen and Gregg (1980) divided the characteristics of mate selection into three categories of assortative mating strength: high, medium, and low. In the "high strength" category of characteristics, they included propinquity, age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion, and politics. The "middle strength" cate-

gory included intelligence, educational status, personality, and vocational interests. The characteristics of the "low strength" category included specific anthropometric traits, talents, and abilities. The strength of assortative mating of a level was described as inverse to the amount of genetic variance displayed by those characteristics included within it. That is, the more heritable characteristics (e.g., specific anthropometric traits) were less powerful criteria in assortative mating than were the less heritable characteristics (e.g., politics). Thiessen and Gregg argued that such a relation capitalized on the genetic homozygosity between the individuals while avoiding the dangers of inbreeding associated with excessive homozygosity.
After reviewing the research on assortative mating, Epstein and Guttman (1984) supported Thiessen and Gregg's

(1980) earlier observation that assortative mating for sociocultural traits was more pronounced than for psychological traits. Yet, differential assortative mating within a group of traits was not supported. Epstein and Guttman concluded that, while it is not random, "the many correlational studies done to date have yielded no definite conclusions as to which personality variables are most highly correlated among married couples" (p. 273).
Several studies have reported differential assortative mating coefficients for variables within a sample. Yet, little research has been put forth which compares estimates from different samples. That research which has compared different samples has been inconclusive (Guttman and Zohar, 1987; Mascie-Taylor, 1989; Price and Vandenberg, 1980). While this research often reports similar patterns in assortative mating coefficients, no statistical analysis or pattern similarity has been employed.
The present investigation will center on the generalizability of assortative mating coefficients for personality variables. Specifically, it will report on the correlating of sets of coefficients which have been reported for scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI; Hathaway and McKinley, 1951). By employing a series of coefficients from a variety of samples and comparing them statistically, I hope that a broader, more accurate picture will be expressed of differential assortative mating.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The MMPI consists of over 550 items, combining to form 10 clinical

scales (e.g., Hysteria, Paranoia) and four validity scales (e.g., Lie). It has been described repeatedly as being the most widely employed objective personality assessment device in a wide range of settings (Brown and McGuire, 1976; Lubin et al., 1985; Piotrowski et al., 1985). In addition, it is viewed as being the most important objective personality test to learn in clinical training centers (Moreland and Dahlstrom, 1983; Wade and Baker, 1977). Its importance in research is illustrated by its numerous citations. For example, Psychological Abstracts reports over five thousand references to the MMPI between 1966 and 1988. The present investigation will focus on the 10 original clinical scales and three of the validity scales (Lie, Fake, and K).
The literature on the MMPI was reviewed to glean those studies which reported sets of spouse (or "prospective spouse") correlations. The only restriction placed on these sets was that the marriage sample not be defined by its instability. Such groups repeatedly have been demonstrated to display lower levels of assortative mating (e.g., Bentler and Newcomb, 1978; Cattell and Nesselroade, 1967). The resultant sets of correlations, as listed in Table 1, are from the following five samples:
Massachusetts. --Gottesman (1965) reported some preliminary analyses from a twin-family project in the greater Boston area. One portion of the presented data was based on an examination of 66 pairs of mothers and fathers of the twins who were in the project. Gottesman presented the correlations between the parents on the 10 clinical scales of the MMPI. Significant levels of positive assortative mating were demonstrated for Scale 1 (Hypo-

which was considerably larger than that calculated for the other samples. Their sample size, however, was also considerably smaller than were the other sample sizes. As a result, the California MMPI correlations would also have the greatest degree of unreliability in their estimates of assortative mating.
Four sets of additional correlational analyses were then undertaken on these coefficients. First, the five full sets of assortative mating coefficients were correlated with one another. Second, this same set of correlations was undertaken while controlling for the effects of differential attenuated range due to scale reliability. None of these correlations, either before or after the adjustment for scale reliability, were significant (see Table 2).
It could be argued that the inclusion of the validity scales in the analyses could obscure any significant clinical scale between-study correlations that might exist. Thus, the same two sets of correlations were undertaken, although they were limited to the 10clinical scales. The resultant sets of correlations are not presented since they did not differ considerably from the Table 2 correlations calculated on all of the MMPI scales.

DISCUSSION
The absence of significant correlations between any two of these samples strongly suggests the lack of generalizability for assortative mating coefficients based on personality variables. Three possible explanations could be offered for the lack of any significant results. First, it could be argued that one should not expect significant correlations of these coefficients because of the vastly disparate nature of the stages of marriage they represent. Research has supported mild convergence or divergence for some personality variables over the course of a marriage (Buss, 1984; Guttman and Zohar, 1987). Nevertheless, this argument does not explain why such widely differing patterns of assortative mating coefficients should appear in different samples.
If one accepts, however, the premise that these samples are representative enough that one should be able to detect at least some degree of pattern similarity, then two alternate explanations are possible. These explanations are commensurate with the view that similarity on characteristics in Thiessen and Gregg's (1980) lower categories (which would include personality variables) results from assortative mating on the "high strength"

category of characteristics. The second proposed explanation is that lower strength characteristic resemblances result directly from assortative mating on "high strength" characteristics. As Thiessen and Gregg stated, "the environment can amplify assortative mating and heighten inclusive fitness . . . by acting as a gravitational sink for the accumulation of similar genotypes" (p. 134). If one further proposes that different "gravitational sinks" lead to different genotypes with different corresponding patterns of personality variables, then it follows that different patterns of assortative mating for these characteristics would result. In this explanation, there is no actual assortment based on "medium strength" or "low strength" characteristics. The appearance of assortative mating for these characteristics results from assortment based solely on the "high strength" characteristics.
The third explanation is a variant of this second explanation and employs more of a "filtering" model. This model suggests that assortative mating on the "high strength" category of characteristics indirectlydetermines assortative mating on the lower strength categories of characteristics. In this model, primary assortment occurs on "high strength" characteristics with

further assortment occurring on characteristics in the "medium strength" category and then in the "low strength." This further assortment, however, is not uniform. The degree of this secondary assortment, as well as the characteristics involved, are determined by the initial assortment. Unlike the previous explanation, assortment continues on the "medium strength" and "low strength" categories of characteristics, although it is moderated by the initial assortment. Previous research by Mascie-Taylor and Vandenberg (1988) supports this explanation over the others. Their results indicate that propinquity has some differential effect on assortative mating for personality, but it does not account for all of spousal similarity.
It is not possible from the present investigation to determine which of the three explanations is the most likely. What can be noted is that the results of this investigation fail to support the generalizability across samples of differential assortative mating coefficients for personality variables. As a result, it is no longer possible to study one or two samples and make wide-ranging statements as to what exact personality variables are more important for assortative mating.
