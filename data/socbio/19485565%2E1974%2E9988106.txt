At least three hypotheses predict that spontaneous abortion risk differs during reproductive history. It has been hypothesized that (1) genuine maternal-age effects change individual risks, (2) genuine birthorder effects change individual risks, and that (3) variant individual risks, which are really independent of both age and parity, produce an artifactual association of risk with age in populations of women.
The availability of large numbers of reproductive histories recorded on magnetic tape by the Collaborative Study on Cerebral Palsy offers an opportunity to weigh these hypotheses. The original intent of the present project was to follow the lead of James (1963) in trying to pit the age and artifact hypotheses against each other. However, examination of the results suggests that parity effects are especially important.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The information was gathered between mid-1959 and mid-1966 by thirteen hospitals, mostly east of the Mississippi. Random samples of essentially all women registering in the obstetric clinics of the collaborating

institutions entered the study. Generally,
the women came from poorer urban areas.
Therefore, several ethnic groups, especially
Negroes, are heavily represented. General
characteristics of the study population and
methods of sampling have been fully de-
scribed by Niswander and Gordon (1972).
The prior reproductive history was, by
protocol, to be taken during the first visit
to a clinic for prenatal care, although emer-
gencies could cause postponements. The
duration of the study permitted repeat
pregnancies. However, our data are taken
from the interviews at first. registrations
only. At this time, women had prior repro-
ductive histories of varying lengths as summarized in Table I.1 Fetal deaths occurring
before 20 weeks gestation are scored as
spontaneous abortions.
The histories used are anamnestic and
1 The eligibility requirements for the various tables are responsible for the apparently variant counts in women from table to table. Any registrant on whom information was available was included in Table 1. Any registrant giving information about at least one prior pregnancy was eligible for Table 2. A woman must have had at least one prior abortion and also at least one prior live birth to be included in Table 3. A woman had to be included in Table 3 and have had at least 3 prior pregnancies for inclusion in Table 4.

not completed; also, each was ascertained through a pregnancy which succeeds the history as used. The Collaborative Study pregnancies through which these reproductive histories were ascertained are themselves biased against being spontaneous abortions. Registration usually occurred late in gestation, and early abortions were frequently missed. Early registrants who aborted at home could be lost if they did not voluntarily report back to the clinic. It is disappointing not to be able to use prenataUy recorded pregnancies along with anamnestic data. The need to omit these later pregnancies tends to reduce the range of maternal ages. However, with respect to reliability of the data, a test showed that the women's recall was about 93 per cent accurate and unbiased.
In the present paper, the data will be analyzed so as to yield broad comparative evaluations of thematernal age, parity,and artifact hypotheses. Detailed conditional risks will be dealt with in another paper.
AGE TRENDS
The first question is whether the data give evidence of age trends, real or artifactual. Table 2 displays by ethnic categories the reported outcome of last pregnancy prior to registering in the Collaborative Study. The choice of penultimate-only pregnancy had the effects of shortening recall period, of weighting women equally, and of using data from later ages (which are sparse here).
The practice of transforming binomial

proportions before regression analysis has been well established by Fisher and Yates (1957). Thechoice of transformation is not critical (Naylor, 1964), and in this paper logits are used. When the logit transforms of abortion risks are regressed on maternal age, the linear component is positive and significant at the 1 per cent level in every ethnic group. In all categories except Negro, the fit to such a simple model, as judged by chi-square for deviations, is quite adequate. Fit in theNegro case is disturbed by the high rate among 13-year-olds and the low rate among 37-year-olds. High abortion risk in extremely young women is not surprising. Aside from that, the 37year-old Negro sample is the only one in all of Table 2 to depart markedly from the trend of increased risk at higher age.
BIRTH ORDER DEFECTS
In his original paper, James (1963) used a small number of reproductive histories obtained through the Kinsey Institute. The women had been interviewed after age 36, and the histories were complete. As with James' data, primary analysis here employs Slater's (1962) rank order statistic on a group of histories, which in this case are not complete but are more numerous than James'.
If in a history of N pregnancies, thejwth one is an abortion and there are no age or parity effects, then we expect 5 = (m -- 1)/(2V-- 1) to have a discontinuous rectangular distribution with a mean of 0.5 and variance of (N + 1 )/12 (N -- 1). With

a large number of histories, the weighted mean of 5 (using the reciprocal of each variance as a weight) would have a nearly normal distribution with expectation of 0.5 and variance equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the weights. In longer histories, more than one abortion may occur. The procedure to follow for n abortions is to take the arithmetic mean of the n birth orders and to compute the variance (squared standard error) on the basis that each such mean is drawn from a finite population of size N (Hald, 1952). The formula for

the variance is (N + 1)(N -- n)/12n(N -I)2.
Application of these formulas to the Collaborative Study yields the results in Table 3. In every ethnic category the observed mean value of Slater's statistic exceeds its expected value of 0.5; every standardized deviation has a negligibly small probability when tested against the normal distribution. The conclusion is that spontaneous abortions tend to come late in a reproductive history. One other indication that random rank distribution cannot be assumed

is a deficiency of runs of spontaneous abortions, which means that live births and spontaneous abortions come in strings or clumps. In predominantly short sequences, the clumps must be at the beginning or end. Because of the results in Table 3, the strings of spontaneous abortions are obviously biased toward the end of reproductive histories. Within the histories as recalled by women registrants, the late-in-sequence tendency could be due to aging, parity effects, or memory bias.
Histories of two prior pregnancies were taken to determine the importance of memory bias. The women were young (since they recalled the first two pregnancies at

memory bias produced the apparent effect, then displacement of a single recalled abortion toward higher parity should increase with length of history. This is not true in Table 5.

A test reported later also discloses no bias.
A direct memory test also discloses no bias. As noted earlier, study registration of different pregnancies for the same woman was possible. At each registration, past reproductive history, as recalled, was recorded. Consistency of recall was therefore

One other attempt to explain the apparent parity effect might be based on length of gestation at registration in the Collaborative Study. Women with the 0 X kind of history might be thought to register earlier so that at least those who abort during the study pregnancy are less likely to be lost. Table 7 shows X O and O X

frequency breakdowns by registration at less than 20 weeks and 20 or more weeks gestation (when known). Among white women there is no hint of such bias, and the sampling variability easily explains the difference among Negroes.
PREGNANCY COMPENSATION
If it were true that all apparent maternal age or parity effects were due to continued reproduction of women with high abortion risk, then (1) there should be no increased risk of abortion with maternal age or parity in women with no prior abortions, and (2) women pregnant at later ages, or parities, should be disproportionately those with previous abortions.

To investigate the first question, data (not shown here) were tabulated for the recalled outcome at parity 2 and parity 3 in women with no history of abortion. Unfortunately, this sample includes few women over 35 and is not entirely satisfactory for investigating maternal age effect. However, in both whites and Negroes a significant regression of abortion frequency (after logit transformation) was present at both parities. This regression had a significant parabolic component in whites, but not in Negroes. The high abortion rate in whites at very young ages might reflect induced abortions. Table 2 suggests that this is also true for Negroes, except that the ages involved are even younger.
Of course, the proportion of women with at least one previous spontaneous abortion increases with maternal age and parity. Such an increase would be seen for any event which might occur even at random in a reproductive history, for example, the proportion of women who have been in a car accident. However, the converse situation does provide a test of the artifact hypothesis. If the hypothesis is correct, then women with at least one abortion should, for a constant gravidity, be older on the average than women with no abortions. Relevant data are shown in Table 8. Women who had 2 or 3 pregnancies prior to the one registered in the Collaborative Study are tabulated by age (dichotomy at 30 years) at last prior pregnancy and by histories antecedent to the last prior pregnancy.
Surprisingly, the white data show a definite trend contrary to expectation under the pregnancy compensation hypothesis. Though not significant in the " 0 " (liveborn) versus " X " (abortion) contrast, the lowering trend in maternal age with prior abortion experience is significant for the longer histories. Equally surprising is the apparent positive finding in the Negro data.

abortions, only data for maternal ages 19 or higher were used.
Multivariate logit analyses were performed to evaluate the predictive values of parity, maternal age, their cross-product, and their squares. Parity squared was the only nonsignificant term (1 per cent level or lower), and the model without it entailed nonsignificant deviations from regression. When the constant multiplying maternal age is not estimated (Model I, Table 9), the linear age term is positive. This fact is noted so that it is understood that the more complete Model I I describes a risk accelerated by maternal age at lower parities. The parity term is positive in both models. However, the negative parity by maternal age interaction suggests that the elderly primigravidas were at high risk in this white sample.
The Negro data show the parity effect; but these women are generally younger than the whites so that real age effect may be largely inoperative. The result is also lower predictability for Negroes as judged by the percentage of total chi-square accounted for by logit regression constants.

The latter is surprising because maternal age artifact would seem largely dependent on effective contraception in the population.
MULTIPLE REGRESSION ON AGE AND PARITY
Since evidence is absent that pregnancy compensation occurred in the white Collaborative Study population, further analysis of age and parity effects is possible; similar methods were used on the Negro data, but conclusions will be less secure.
First, the data shown in Table 2 were retabulated with breakdowns by parity as well as maternal age. Because fetal deaths occurring in women of early-teen age are too likely to be unacknowledged induced

STATISTICAL STUDIES OF
ABORTION RISK
Similar evidence for both parity and maternal age effects on abortion risk occurs in the study by Warburton and Fraser (1964). The Montreal data made parental age seem more important than the Collaborative Study data do. However, the women in the older study were ascertained through. a live birth which could have been in the middle of the reproductive history so that data for pregnancies at later age were relatively more common. The parity effect was evident even though full weight was given to parental age by estimating effects of both mother's and father's ages. Despite differences in ethnic and socioeconomic bases, the data of Warburton and Fraser

(1964) lead to nearly the same conclusions as the Cerebral Palsy data.
The failure of James (1963) to find the parity effect for which he was directly testing is puzzling. His data are not adequately detailed in his paper so that the reason for conflicting conclusion is left open. I t could be sample size (smaller for James), analytic difference (inverse variance weighting not used by James), or population base (James' women were older, post-reproductive, and not obviously ascertained through pregnancy outcome). James does probe for positive evidence of age artifact. He reasons that if habitual aborters do attempt to compensate, they should have more pregnancies in completed family histories, such as he used. He then defines a habitual aborter as a woman with 30 per cent or more abortion experience. In his sample, such "abortionprone" women have a higher mean number of pregnancies than "abortion-resistant" women.
However, a woman with only one pregnancy would have a 100 per cent abortion rate, while a woman with two pregnancies would require a SO per cent abortion rate to be "abortion-prone." A three-pregnancy woman must abort only 33 per cent of the time to be "abortion-prone." The mean number of pregnancies are 2.79 for the

"abortion-prone," and 2.42 for the "abortion-resistant" in James' sample. This difference is clearly a byproduct of the definition of "abortion-proneness."
Roberts (1964) examines data found in the literature for family size effect in terms of the double binomial distribution which was also fitted by James. The theory of this distribution involves the assumption of two groups--a high-risk abortion-prone class of women and a low-risk abortionresistant class. However, it seems unreasonable to suppose that women are divisible into two well defined high-risk and low-risk classes. I would take the Warburton and Fraser (1964) position that there are many gradations among women in abortion risk. In fact, James (1963) found that the negative binomial distribution which makes this latter assumption usually gave a serviceable fit to such data. If negative binomials gave good fits to the data used by Roberts, the practical constancy of overall risk with respect to family size would be a strong argument against James' artifact hypothesis.
Shapiro et al. (1962) make an observation confirming a nonartifactual age effect. They report that among primigravidas in the Health Insurance Plan of New York fetal death risk (mostly in first 19 weeks

of pregnancy) is highest for those 35 and older.
BIOLOGICAL CAUSES OF ABORTION
Warburton and Fraser (1964) reached very similar conclusions to Shapiro et al. (1962), and their review of the literature is still quite pertinent. The great likelihood that fetal chromosomal anomalies cause spontaneous abortions and the problems of judging their importance have been stated by an international committee (WHO, 1966). Trisomies appear to be factors and do depend on maternal age. In more recent papers, Bowen and Lee (1969), suspect triploidy to be implicated, while Carr (1971) does not. Doepfner (1962) and Niendorf (1964) have suggested that polyspermy is a factor.
Although maternal chromosomal aberrations, which would cause constant high risk, may be of some importance (Wingate, 1965), the consanguinity study of Slatis et al. (1958) indicates that segregation of deleterious recessive alleles is not contributory.
That diabetic women are abortion prone has been known for some time (Dekaban and Baird, 1955), and it is believed (Eastman and Hellman, 1961) that the effect increases with maternal age.
The birth-order effect detected here would result if women can become sensitized to paternal antigens or have some other change inflicted as a result of sexual intercourse and/or carriage of fetuses. On the other hand, in a study of liveborn children from the Collaborative Study, we (Warburton and Naylor, 1971) tentatively reached the conclusion that beneficial hypertrophy might be a consequence of sensitization to paternal antigens. An attempt is being made to amass data on this latter point.
Basing his remarks largely on rodent studies, Simmons (1969) reviews the ana-

tomical and serological considerations which attend regarding the fetus as an allograft subject to immunologic attack by the mother. Rowley et al. (1963) in a thorough-going study of 34 high-risk aborters were unable to find any correlate with risk; however, the newer histocompatibility tests were not available then.
ABO blood type appears to be a factor in fetal death (Golovachev and Bokarius, 1971; Peritz, 1971). The data of Peritz, in particular, imply mother-fetus interaction. However, if sensitization is important, then female B and male A matings should be at the same high risk as female 0 and male A matings; but they do not seem to be.
Naib et al. (1970) found elevated abortion risk in women with genital herpetic infection. Aurelian et al. (1971) recently isolated herpesvirus from cervical tumor cells; cervical infection is apparently the result of sexual activity, since cervical cancer is rare among nuns. The important parity effect demonstrated here could be due to blood type incompatibility, transplantation incompatibility, or persistent viral infection.
SUMMARY
Reproductive histories of women registered in the Collaborative Study on Cerebral Palsy were studied. The data clearly showed that among women with histories mixing spontaneous abortions and live births, risk of abortion was greater at higher parity. Although the women sampled tended to be young, an increase of risk with age was demonstrated in the white sample. These effects were not due to sample biases. Negro age effects were possibly confounded with pregnancy compensation artifact which can mimic aging influence in unselected samples.
