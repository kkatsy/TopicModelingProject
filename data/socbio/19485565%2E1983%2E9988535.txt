ABSTRACT: In this admixed population with no significant confounding of race and environment, there is an increase of blood pressure with Negro ancestry. There appears to be a direct effect of race on blood pressure in addition to an indirect effect through height.

A significant association between race and blood pressure has been shown by several studies in different populations. According to this relationship, higher levels of arterial pressure are found among individuals of Negro ancestry (Lennard and Glock, 1955;Johnson and Remington, 1961; Langford et al., 1968; MacLean et al., 1974; Barbosa, 1976). However, as the confounding of racial admixture with some environmental factors affecting blood pressure cannot be excluded, the causality of a primary effect of race is questionable.
In this paper we test whether racial effect is casual or merely due to confounding with other factors in a Brazilian admixed population where the environment differences among racial groups are nonsignificant.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Measurements of height and of systolic and diastolic blood pressures were taken in a standard manner by one person (Nance et al., 1965). These variables were adjusted for age and sex effects by regression on a polynomial function f(a,s) which includes sex, age, age2,

age3, sex x age, sex x age2 and sex x age3. The stability of variance of the adjusted variables with increasing values off(a,s) was examined, taking

Race as a proportion of Negroid admixture was taken independently for each individual from a phenotypic scale calibrated against several genetic systems (Krieger et al., 1965). The variable "race" was created by regressing the first principal component of height and systolic and diastolic blood pressures on Negroid admixture, the latter estimated from phenotypes and polymorphisms. Similarly, an environmental index (called "estimated environment" in Figure 1) was created by regressing the principal component on a linear function f(z) of parental literacy, type of habitation, and geographical coordinates of the place of family origin. This generates ten correlation coefficients between race, environmental index,

and variance - covariance matrix 2 incorporates correlations between correlations (Elston, 1975). Since Z transforms follow a multivariate normal distribution (Rao, 1979), the loglikelihood is
lnL = - ( x 2 + ln|2|)/2 + constant
where X\ a quadratic form in terms of Zxy and Z xy, asymptotically follows a X2 distribution with m-k degrees of freedom (m is the number of observed correlations and k is the number of parameters estimated) and |S| is the determinant of the matrix X.
Estimates of path coefficients are obtained by maximizing lnL; likelihood ratio tests of hypotheses are carried out in terms of the residual X2, since 1«|S| does not vary much across hypotheses. When k+w parameters are estimated under the general model, goodness-of-fit of the model is tested by the residual X2 value with m-k-w degrees of freedom and denoted here as

RESULTS
The simple correlation with Negroid admixture was 0.08 for height and for systolic pressure and 0.04 for diastolic pressure. These correlations are small but statistically significant, with n =5,570 observations.
Expressed as standard partial regression coefficients, the associations are consistent (Table 1). A displacement of one standard deviation in race as mesured changes height and systolic pres-

Systolic and diastolic blood pressures are postulated as the effects of two underlying causes: true environment and "blood pressure." Race has a direct effect on blood pressure, as well as an indirect effect through height.

Under the general hypothesis, we es-

timate the direct contribution of race to blood pressure as

and the indirect contribution (through environment and height) at 0.029.

gestive of a genetic basis especially since the environmental components which predispose to elevate blood pressure do not appear to be confounded with race in the studied population. However, the possibility that some unmeasured environmental cause is associated with race cannot be entirely excluded on this evidence.
Our analyses provide evidence that both race and height directly effect blood pressure. This is in a good agreement with previous findings of an increase of blood pressure with height independent of obesity (Feinleib and Garrison, 1979; Ward et al. 1979) and with the suggestion that height is enhanced by African ancestry (Krieger, 1970).
Other studies indicate a consistent racial difference for adults in North America and the Caribbean, regardless of salt intake (Johnson and Remington, 1961). The racial difference is less (and for some samples nonsignificant) in childhood, but urinary kallikrein concentration is reduced in black children (Zinner et al. 1976). This may be a percursor of subsequent blood pressure elevation.
Attempts to define psychologic and sociocultural factors of hypertension have been plagued with measurement

problems (Scotch and Geiger, 1963). Race relations were easier in Northeastern Brazil than in the United States, and racial admixture has progressed further (Smith, 1951). A stress hytpothesis appears neither plausible nor testable in this population, but would be difficult to exclude.
Despite the suggestive evidence of a genetic basis, the hypothesis of a common gene with large effect on blood pressure is excluded by segregation analysis. Contrary to Platt (1963) there is no detectable megaphenic polymorphism for blood pressure (Morton et al., 1980; Krieger etal. 1980).
Lacking clear evidence of a specific mechanism underlying the racial difference, more sophisticated studies of family resemblance in this hybrid population, including estimates of racial mixture and biological as well as adoptive relationships could in principle discriminate between genetic and cultural inheritance (Rao et al., 1974).
