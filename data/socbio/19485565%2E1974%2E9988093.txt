A number of North American human biologists met in April, 1973, and initiated the formation of an organization for the purpose of supporting the journal Human Biology and nominating its editors.
Therefore, the Human Biology Council to advance the science of human biology, through advice to and support of Human Biology and other relevant publications, and through promotion of research and teaching concerning human biological variation, has now been established.
Members for 1974 will be considered Charter Members. Scholars and students who wish to join should write to the chairman pro-tem, Dr. Paul Baker (Department of Anthropology, Sll Social Science Building, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802), and should summarize their qualifications. Student membership is for a

period of not more than 3 years and applications must include a statement from a professor who can vouch for the status as a student.
Dues for 1974 are $10.00 for regular members and $6.00 for student members. Dues include subscription to the quarterly journal Human Biology. Checks should be made out to the "Human Biology Council" and may be sent with applications to Dr. Paul Baker, chairman of the Organizing Committee, who will arrange the review of applications and will forward dues payments to the acting treasurer, Dr. Michael A. Little.
Donations to help cover the organizing expenses will be appreciated. Arrangements are being made to suitably recognize supporting members and benefactors and to gain tax exempt status.
