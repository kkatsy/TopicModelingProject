The Cayapo Indians are generally classified as members of the Northwestern branch of the Ge linguistic family (Lowie, 1946; Tax, 1960). In former times they were subdivided into Northern and Southern groups, which occupied a vast region in Central and Northern Brazil.
The Southern bands are now extinct. The Northern Cayapo live at present in eight semi-independent communities in the states of Para and Mato Grosso, reaching from latitude 5° to 10° S. and from longitude 51° to 54° W. (Fig. 1). The Xikrin or Djore subgroup is divided into two populations, one, numbering about 150 individuals, located near the Caetete river, an affluent of the left margin of the Itacaiunas, and a smaller one with about 90 persons, living near the Bacaja river. The Mekranoti are also located in two communities; about 30 of them live with 60 Kararao in a place called Bau (lat. 6°3S' S., long. 51°90' W.), while the remaining 240 are in the Iriri river region (lat. 8°40' S., long. 54° W.). Some 260 Gorotire live in a post of the National Indian Foundation near the Fresco River (lat. 7°44' S., long., 51°10' W.), while the Ko-krai-moro, numbering about 150, live in the Serra Encontrada (lat. 7°28' S., long. 52°44' W.). The largest present Cayapo group is represented by the Kuben-Kran-Kegn; some 310

individuals are located near the Riosinho river, an affluent of the Fresco (lat. 8°10' S., long. 52°8' W.); finally the Txukahamae or Mentuktire, numbering some 190 persons, live in the Xingu National Park in the northern region of the state of Mato Grosso, in a place called Porori. Therefore, at present the whole Cayapo population does not total 1,500 individuals. This figure should be compared with an estimate of the last century made by H. Coudreau, who calculated a population of 5,000 for these Indians.
A large number of authors have studied special aspects of the Cayapo culture and language (references in Baldus, 1954,1968), but definitive research about their social structure and organization are still lacking. Perhaps the most important recent investigations are those of Dreyfus (1963) on the social life and culture of the Gorotire and Kuben-Kran-Kegn and those of Frikel (1968) on the material culture of the Xikrin. T. S. Turner has gathered much material from different groups for his still unpublished thesis. On the biological side, Bellizzi (1958,1961) has studied some of the Cayapo anthropometrically and in relation to health; Mattos (1958) measured the vision acuity and color vision of 73 Gorotire Indians; Nutels, Ayres, and Salzano (1967) performed tuberculin tests, x-ray and bac-

teriological studies among the Txukahamae; and Vieira Filho (1970) studied the dermatoglyphics of the Xikrin.
The recent history of these groups can be summarized as follows (Turner, unpub-

lished; Diniz, 1963). The Northern Cayapo may have consisted of a single large population at the end of the seventeenth century. Some time afterwards, however, they split into three groups: the Pau d'Arco, Xikrin,

and Gorotire. The first became extinct; the Xikrin have remained as a distinct branch ever since, dividing into two groups around 1956, while the Gorotire have suffered several fissions and fusions. The first split among them occurred around 1905, giving rise to the Mekranoti subgroup. The latter divided again, with part of the population going to the Xingu area and the remaining to the Iriri region. A new fission then occurred in the Xingu population, the result being the present Txukahamae, while the other faction joined a dissident group from the Iriri band, remaining with them in that area. The Bau population is a result of the fusion of the Kararao, who separated from the Gorotire around 1936, and part of the Mekranoti of the Iriri. A further subdivision of the Gorotire are the Kuben-Kran-Kegn; this split occurred also around 1936 when the Gorotire had their first contacts with Neo-Brazilians. A few years afterwards the Ko-krai-moro diverged as a sub-branch of the Kuben-Kran-Kegn.
The degree of acculturation of these populations varies considerably, and this is of course related to the time of contact between them and the Neo-Brazilians as well as to the nature of these contacts and the degree of geographic isolation. The first group to establish relatively stable relations with Neo-Brazilians were the Gorotire and this occurred in 1937. All the other groups were pacified in the fifties, as follows: the Kuben-Kran-Kegn in 1952; the Txukahamae in 1953; the Xikrin in 1954; the Kokrai-moro in 1957; and the Mekranoti (Iriri and Bau) in 1958. According to Turner (unpublished), Frikel (1963), and my own observations, I would rank these groups in terms of acculturation in the following order. The most acculturated are the Gorotire and Xikrin; then come the Ko-krai-moro and Kuben-Kran-Kegn; last come the Txukahamae and Mekranoti (Iriri and Bau) populations, the most "untouched" of all.
Since 1965 my collaborators and myself have been obtaining demographic, medical,

morphological, and genetic information among these Indians, part of the material being also sent to Ann Arbor, Michigan, for special studies by J. V. Neel and co-workers. A first paper about the health situation among the Txukahamae has already been published (Nutels, Ayres, and Salzano, 1967); the present communication is the first of a series in which these other results will be reported.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The demographic data which will be presented here were collected in four expeditions to three Cayapo communities as follows: (1) The first visit to the Kuben-KranKegn was from July 13 to 26,1965. Since at that time many of the Indians were away hunting, a second trip was made and new information obtained during the period September 15-27, 1968. (2) Field work among the Txukahamae was performed from June 19 to July 7, 1966. (3) Studies of the Mekranoti (Iriri) were made from May 21 to June 2,1969.
The collection of information was made by interviews with one or both members of each nuclear family who always came with their children. The questions asked involved: (1) name of the spouses; (2) birthplace; (3) parents' names; (4) parents' sibs; (5) relationship between the parents' sibs; (6) sibs; (7) number of children alive and dead; (8) stillbirths; (9) names, sex, and ages of the living children; (10) ages and sex of dead children; (11) birthplaces of all members of the family; (12) information about those who left the community; and (13) other marriages of one or both spouses.
In these interviews I was assisted among the Kuben-Kran-Kegn by the Indian Kuriko, among the Txukahamae by Rop-ni, and among the Mekranoti by the missionary Dale Snyder. These interpreters understood Portuguese well and since they knew all members of the group very well their assistance was of great importance to ascertain the reliability of the information.

Following Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza (1968) I have presented in Table 3 the backward stochastic migration matrix for the three groups studied. It shows theprobabilities that children born in these three places have parents derived from other Cayapo populations. As shown, the main contributors of outside genes to theTxukahamae are the Ko-krai-moro; the importance of the exchange between the Mekranoti andKuben-Kran-Kegn is also apparent, each being the main source of outside genes to the other.
The average inbreeding coefficients are presented in Table 4. There is a marked difference between the Mekranoti and Txukahamae on the one hand and the KubenKran-Kegn on the other. While among the first the inbreeding coefficients have been estimated as 0.0022 to 0.0028, in the latter this value is much lower (0.0003). The average coefficient obtained from data of the three populations is somewhat low for Indian populations at this cultural level (Salzano, 1970). An attempt was made, using T. S. Turner's complete genealogy of the

Txukahamae, to verify how inefficient the method employed to collect consanguinity information was for detecting remote inbreeding. Only two more consanguineous marriages were ascertained using the complete genealogy, and due to the inclusion of marriages not considered in my census the average inbreeding coefficient calculated using this information would actually be lower (0.0026) than the one estimated. It is concluded, therefore, that while the values presented in Table 4 are underestimates due to thelack of information about remoteconsanguinity, no better estimates could probably be obtained in these populations using demographic data only.
FERTILITY AND MORTALITY
The data on reproduction and survival are presented in Tables 5-8. Monogamy is the rule among these populations, but there are many comments about sexual freedom. Several cases of women who are not formally married andserve asmistresses forthe men in the village were also observed. Asis shown in Table 5, the average number of

live births per married female over the age of 15 is higher among the Txukahamae (3.8 ± 0.3) than among the Kuben-KranKegn (2.4 ± 0.2), the average among the Mekranoti showing an intermediate value. The total, considering the three populations (3.0 + 0.2), is in the lower range of equivalent estimates made among hunters and gatherers with incipient agriculture (Salzano, 1970). The number of liveborn offspring in completed sibships (Table 6) is intermediate in relation to those previous findings, the variance being somewhat low. The percentage of childless marriages (no liveborn offspring after three years of life in common) varied among the three localities. No such marriages were observed in 42 couples among the Mekranoti, one in 56 among the Txukahamae, but five in 105 among the Kuben-Kran-Kegn. The incidence in the last group is of the same order of magnitude as that observed among the Caingang (about 5%; see Salzano, 1961, 1964).
Taking into consideration the mortality observed (Tables 7 and 9), all the populations studied seem to be at or somewhat above the replacement level. As for the average number of surviving offspring per

female who had at least one liveborn child (Table 7), the values are similar in the three Cayapo groups, showing that the lower birth rate among the Kuben-Kran-Kegn is compensated by a low death rate (the decrease in relation to the livebirth average is 32% among the Txukahamae, but only 17% among the Kuben-Kran-Kegn). The averages found are within the range observed in tribes living at this cultural level (Salzano, 1970). The numbers for the surviving offspring in completed sibships are shown in Table 8. They are again intermediate in relation to previous findings, with a low variance.
BREEDING SIZE, EFFECTIVE SIZE, AND SELECTION POTENTIAL
Two important parameters in the genetic structure of a population are their breeding and effective sizes. In the Indian groups studied so far the breeding sizes varied from 38% to 46% and the effective sizes from 21% to 46% of their total populations (Salzano, 1970). The values observed among the Cayapo (37%-39%; 33%-37%) are at the lower end for the first variable and are intermediate in relation to the second.

vised by Crow (1958) furnishes a convenient number which indicates the intensity with which selective factors can act in a population through fertility and mortality differences. Due to the relatively low mortality observed among the Cayapo (compared to those prevailing in populations at this same level of technological advance), as well as their relatively small variance in completed family sizes, they show one of the lowest indices of potential selection calculated so far in American Indian tribes (0.71). As a matter of fact, the only lower index was the one calculated for the Terena (0.63; see Salzano and Cardoso de Oliveira, 1970). The others observed among hunters and gatherers with incipient agriculture were: Yanomama, 0.88; and Xavante, 0.90. Those calculated from data obtained among agriculturalists and tribes somewhat acculturated were, besides the Terena value, the following: Maca, 0.88; Caingang, 1.29; and Ramah Navaho, 2.53 (for references, see Salzano, 1970).
DISCUSSION
Taken as a whole, the three Cayapo populations studied show similar age distributions and endogamy rates but low sex-ratio and inbreeding rates in relation to those prevailing among tribes at this level of cultural development. Fertility is moderate with a small variance, and mortality low. However, while the three groups show similarity among themselves for sex ratio, endogamy, number of surviving offspring and the percentage of breeding, and effective sizes in relation to the total population, dissimilarities can be observed as well. In particular, the Txukahamae and Kuben-Kran-Kegn show clear differences among themselves, the latter having an older age distribution, lower inbreeding, an average number of liveborn children and mortality rates, and a relatively high incidence of childless marriages. It is reasonable to suppose that these differences are due to the more advanced

process of acculturation prevailing among the Kuben-Kran-Kegn.
Despite these differences all three populations are at or somewhat above the replacement level. These findings may appear inconsistent with the depopulation rate that can be calculated from the fact that only 1,500 Cayapo Indians survive from a probable population of 5,000 estimated in the last century. It should be clear, however, that the Txukahamae and Mekranoti are having only intermittent contacts with NeoBrazilians, and that while among the Kuben-Kran-Kegn these contacts have been of a longer duration, they are still relatively isolated. The situation may be different among more acculturated groups, like the Gorotire and Xikrin, and the devastating effects of the first shocks with our culture (both in terms of violent deaths and decimation by epidemics), even if generally undocumented, should be considered as well.
The recent history of these Cayapo populations shows striking similarities with those observed among the Xavante and Yanomama Indians. This adds new evidence indicating that the fission-fusion pattern of genetic structure proposed by Neel and Salzano (1967) may in fact be a general feature of groups of hunters and gatherers with incipient agriculture.
SUMMARY
Three populations of Cayapo Indians from southern Para and northern Mato Grosso, Brazil, in general show similar age distributions and endogamy rates, but low sex ratios and inbreeding rates when compared to those prevailing among other South American hunters and gatherers with incipient agriculture. Their fertility is moderate with a small variance, and mortality is low. The index of opportunity for selection, therefore, is one of the lowest calculated so far for groups at this cultural stage. Some differences were observed/among the three

populations in some of the demographic variables and they were attributed toacculturation, which is occurring at different rates among them. In accordance with previous studies in other South American tribes, the pattern of exchange between local groups can be better described in terms of the fission-fusion model of genetic structure.

lation. During the field work I received much help and information from Bertoldo Lira, Dale Snyder, Horace Banner, and Padre Jaime R. Candela; my colleagues F. J. da Rocha, G.V. Sim5es and M. Ayres also helped in many ways. The Fundacao Nacional do Indio and Parque Nacional do Xingu gave permission tostudy the Indians andprovided all facilities. Transportation to and from the villages was made possible by Asas deSocorro and the skillful assistanceof Elmer Reaser, George Insley, and William Born. Our research issupported by the Conselho Nacional de Pesquisas, Conselho de Pesquisas da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Coordenacao doAperfeicoamento doPessoal de Nivel Superior, Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, and the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.
