Siblings and dizygotic (DZ) cotwins as a group share approximately 50% of their genes in common, but a single pair may theoretically have a common inheritance of zero to forty-six chromosomes (or portions of chromosomes). In the case of samesex pairs, the theoretical range is from one to forty-six, but a more realistic range is probably from 25% to 75% of the total genome, distributed around a mean of 50%.
To the extent that phenotypic physical and behavioral characteristics are genetically determined, the sib pairs who share a more common inheritance should be more similar in appearance and behavior than those with fewer genes in common. An estímate of genetic differences between DZ cotwins and siblings can be provided by red blood cell factors that assort independently between the members of a pair. Independent assortment of blood group factors is evidence of their location on different chromosomes or of their location at great distances on the same chromosome.

Although the comparison of MZ and DZ twins has often been reported, there has been little exploration of the contribution that a study of variability in common inheritance among sibs or DZ twins could make to understanding genetic and environmental variances in behavior and morphology. Two rather different approaches can be made to blood group and behavioral-morphological data on DZ twins. One approach looks for possible relationships between the number of blood-group differences and the degree of cotwin dissimilarity in behavioral-morphological traits. A second approach seeks genetic linkages between blood group loci and specific behavioral-morphological differences. This paper includes both approaches to data on same-sex DZ twins.
We know of no previous study that has explored the relationship between quantitative variation across many blood group loci and variation in the behavior and morphology of siblings and DZ twins. By counting all definite allelic variations between cotwins, we sought to measure the effects of total differences at the marker loci sampled. By implication, those twins with more numerous differences at the loci

sampled may be those with larger total differences in their genomes.
Although it is well known that sib pairs can provide information on genetic linkage, only one study has been published in which data on DZ twins have been used for this purpose (Bock et al., 1970). Haseman and Elston (1972) have recently devised some powerful methods for analyzing genetic linkage between quantitative traits and marker genes in sib-pair data. Therefore, to demonstrate the possibilities available, in this paper we reanalyze data on same sex DZ twins from a previously reported study (Scarr, 1966a,b, 1968, 1969).

METHOD
SAMPLE
The sample consists of 26 pairs of DZ same-sex, female twins from the Boston area. Characteristics of the sample have been previously reported (Scarr, 1966a).
BLOOD FACTORS
The twins were tested by the Boston Blood Grouping Laboratory for the presence of over thirty factors. Eliminating those systems for which the twins were not polymorphic, or for which not all twins were tested, the following nine polymorphic marker systems remained: ABO, Rhesus (Rh), P, Lewis (Le), Secretor (Se), MNSs, Duffy (Fy), Kidd (Jk) and Haptoglobin (Hp). The Gm system, which was not used for all twin pairs, was the only blood group difference for two pairs, and so is included in Table 1, which shows the distribution of blood system differences across the 26 pairs of twins. The Lutheran (Lu) blood group, which was not polymorphic enough in this sample, was not used in the linkage analysis but used in the analysis of twin differences. Unfortunately, comparable marker system data from the parents was not available. Thus, the derived index of dissimilarity underutilized the potential

information to be gained from such blood factors. Table 2 gives the maximum likelihood estimates of the gene frequencies obtained from the sample.
MEASURES OF APPEARANCE AND BEHAVIOR
Two experimenters independently made ratings on the physical similarity of the twins by guessing their zygocity (in a larger sample of MZ as well as DZ pairs) and rating degrees of certainty in their diagnoses. A scale from positively dizygotic through questionable to positively monozygotic was constructed from their combined ratings. The mothers were also asked to rate the zygocity of their own twins on a simple MZ or DZ basis. Since judgments were based almost entirely on morpho-

logical characteristics, these ratings were considered to reflect the degree of similarity in appearance of the twins.
A large number of measures of personality and behavior were used in the study of the twins. The 49 measures varied from psychoanalytically-based motives to reaction times. Only the ten measures of reaction time and preferred levels of activity, which were themselves intercorrelated, were selected for analysis in this paper because of their previously shown heritability. This cluster of activity measures was described in Scarr, 1966a.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Several different computer programs were used to analyze the data. These are now

being organized into a single package in order to facilitate future analyses of this nature (Namboodiri and Siervogel, in preparation). The maximum likelihood gene frequency estimates given in Table 2 were obtained, allowing for the sibling relationship between members of each pair, by a numerical search of the likelihood surface (Kaplan and Elston, 1972).
Association between the phenotypes of each polymorphic marker system and each activity measure was tested by a simple one-way analysis of variance, the number of classes being equal to the number of different phenotypes for the marker system. Since the sibling relationship was ignored in this analysis, and since siblings will tend to be more similar than random members of the population for all phenotypic traits (for both genetic and environmental reasons), significant association found by this test does not necessarily imply pleiotropy. Lack of significant association on the basis of such a test, however, does imply that if the activity measure is partially determined by a locus linked to the marker locus, then there is no significant linkage disequilibrium between the two loci.
Using the method given by Haseman and Elston (1972), linkage was detected by regressing the squared twin difference, for a given activity measure, on the estimated proportion of genes identical by descent that the twin pair shares at a given locus. A significant negative regression, in the absence of association between the activity measure and the marker phenotypes, is indicative of linkage. Since squared differences cannot possibly be normally distributed, the usual parametric /-statistics for testing regression will in this case approximate Student's ¿-distribution (under the null hypothesis of no regression) in very large samples only; therefore the rank correlation, and the corresponding /-statistic (t = r[(n -- 2 ) /

(1 -- r*)]1/2), has also been calculated. Furthermore, in an attempt to avoid spuriously significant results due to an inappropriate scale of measurement, the calculations were performed both on the raw activities scores and on their logarithms. In order to estimate the proportion of genes identical by descent shared by a twin pair, the gene frequencies for the marker system are needed; the calculations were performed using both the estimated gene frequencies in Table 2 and, in a separate set of computer runs, the gene frequencies reported by Race and Sänger (1968) for Caucasian populations.
RESULTS
BLOOD GROUP AND BEHAVIORALMORPHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES
As Table 3 indicates, substantial correlations were found between the number of blood group differences and differences in the appearance of the cotwins. A correlation of 0.51 was obtained between the experimenters' ratings of physical dissimilarity and the absolute number of definite blood group alíele differences.
Since mothers' ratings were a binary distribution of MZ and DZ responses, their guesses were treated in a chi-square distribution, divided between less-than-four and four-or-more blood group differences. Of the 14 pairs with fewer than four blood system differences, five were rated as MZ and nine as DZ. Of the 12 pairs with four or more differences, only two were guessed to be MZ while 10 were judged to be DZ. This resulted in a chi-square value of 6.31, significant at less than the 0.05 level.
Ratings of behavioral dissimilarity by both the mother and the combined experimenters were positively but not significantly correlated with blood group differences between the DZ cotwins. The larger the number of blood group differences, the

more dissimilar their activity levels and general behavior were judged to be.
Seven of the eight behavioral measures of differences in reaction times and preferences for activity level correlated positively with blood group differences. Two of the eight measures of activity were significant at or beyond the 0.05 level.
Birth weight differences between the DZ cotwins were included in the correlational analysis to examine intrauterine influences on cotwin differences. Birth weight differences were found to correlate with blood group differences in a negative direction (r= --.28), while behavioral and blood group differences were positively correlated. Thus, birth weight differences were not seen as a major contaminant of the relationship between genetic and behavioral similarity among DZ twins. It is worthy of note, however, that such a negative relation between birth weight and blood group differences would seem to find an interesting parallel in a recent study (Kaelber and Pugh, 1969) in which it was found that large birth weight differences between twin partners are accompanied by

significant IQ differences in monozygotic pairs, but not in dizygotic pairs.
GENETIC LINKAGE ANALYSES
Of the ninety tests of association performed (10 activity measures times 9 marker systems), nine were significant at the 5% level, and of these one was significant at the 1% level. These are indicated by daggers in Table 4, but, for the reasons stated above, no implication should be drawn from these particular associations other than that they can be the cause of significant results in the linkage tests. (The very significant association between Rh and Toys total time is due to one observation, the only one in its particular phenotypic class).
The results of the tests for linkage differed little whether the estimated or the previously reported gene frequencies were used. We therefore report here only the results for the estimated frequencies, which, in view of the fact that they show no evidence of deviating greatly from normal Caucasian populations, are probably more appropriate.

The general effect of taking logarithms of the raw data was a tendency to decrease the significance of the linkage test results. This effect, however, was important only for those activity measures whose distribution is positively skewed. A choice was made as follows, for each activity measure, to determine whether to report the detailed results from the calculations on the raw measures or on their logarithms. An empirical cumulative plot of the 52 data points was compared visually with the best-fitting cumulative normal and log normal distributions. In addition, measures of skewness and kurtosis were calculated for each distribution. In the case of four of the measures the log normal distribution clearly fitted the data much better, and so for these activity measures

the detailed results after a logarithmic transformation are reported; in the other six cases a normal distribution fitted better and the detailed results using the raw data are reported.
The detailed results are given in Table 4 in the form of ¿-statistics. For each of the 90 possible linkage relationships two /-statistics, with 24 degrees of freedom, are given: the usual one for a parametric test of unweighted linear regression, the /-statistic derived from the nonparametric rank correlation. Out of these 180 statistics, 110 (61.1%) are negative; 14 (7.8%) are significantly negative at the 5% level, and 3 (1.7%) are further significantly negative at the 1% level. It is thus clear there is an overall tendency for the regressions to be negative, implying

a definite genetic involvement in the variation of the ten activity measures. Since the percentages of significant tests were only slightly higher than that expected due to chance (7.8% vs. 5% and 1.7% vs. 1%), these results can at best be only weak indications of particular linkages.
The most significant results in Table 4 indicate that the best evidence is for the three linkages

The only important differences between the results in Table 4 and what might be inferred from all of the calculations performed concern certain significant results that might be missed. If the raw measures, and not the logarithms, are analyzed, the following are further found to be significant at the Sfo level:

However, none of these receive convincing support from the results in Table 4.
Again, it should be emphasized that the linkages reported above can only be considered as tentative possibilities to be examined more closely in future investigations. Although one or two of them may in fact be real, much larger samples are necessary before any firm statements can be made as to which of the significant re-

sults reflect real phenomena and which merely reflect "Type 1 error."
DISCUSSION
The first hypothesis, that blood group differences can be used as indices of genetic dissimilarity which would be found to be related to physical and behavioral differences, is confirmed for measures of physical appearance and activity level. The usefulness of blood groups as markers of genotypic differences in the quantitative study of sibling variability is supported. The ability to estimate the degree of genetic similarity between sibs could have important implications for the study of genetic and environmental influences within families.
The second hypothesis, that genetic linkages can be found between marker genes and major genes controlling behavioral characteristics also finds support. A negative regression is to be expected if one or more genes, determining variability in the quantitative measure, are genetically linked to the marker. There are also other ways in which a negative regression could conceivably occur (involving epistasis, and possibly environmental interactions), but linkage would appear to be the simplest explanation. In any case, if the regression in the population (as opposed to the sample) is truly negative, then the marker locus, which is known to be genetically determined, is necessarily involved (see Bock et al., 1970). Had the sample size been larger, it would have been feasible to analyze the data further, in the manner suggested by Haseman and Elston (1972), in an attempt to pinpoint major genes affecting the activity measures. There is also the possibility that a multivariate extension of the methods used in this paper, somewhat analogous to the approach used by Bock et al. (1970), would help define any linkages present.

This study supports the usefulness of "blood groups as markers in the quantitative study of sibling pairs. Furthermore it shows that the use of same sex dizygotic twins, in which the effects of developmental (age) and environmental effects are minimized, can be extremely useful in elucidating genetic influences within families. It is often assumed in behavioral studies that within-family similarities among children are entirely of postnatal environmental origin. Social psychological research has emphasized the importance of identification with parents, role learning, and socialization practices on the development of child behavior. Similarities between sibs are usually ascribed to these processes regardless of the genetic similarity or dissimilarity of children within the same family. Only in the case of MZ twins are most psychologists prepared to consider the role of genotype in determining similarity of behavior within a sibship.
If blood group factors were used to investigate genetic linkages in DZ twins and sibs, including opposite sex pairs, then the effects of environmental contingencies on their behavioral similarities and differences could be better understood. This paper has attempted to demonstrate the feasibility of such an approach.
