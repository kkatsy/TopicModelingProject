ABSTRACT:A model is developed to study the effects of fertility and mortality on number of living children and on extinction of family. Numerical illustrations are provided by applying the model to three different populations differing in fertility and mortality. It is found that a combination of a high birth rate and a low death rate is required to assure a reasonable probability that the family will not ultimately become extinct. A moderate to high birth rate and a low death rate are necessary to assure that there will be at least one surviving son in the parents' old age. This finding implies that zero population growth is impossible as long as parents depend on children for old age security. Thus, alternate old age security measures must be adopted by societies attempting to reduce their birth rate to the replacement level.

A desire for continuity of the family name and for living children to support them in their old age is thought to influence the fertility behavior of couples in many developing countries. A reduction in mortality will increase the chances of survival for children and the continuation of family name. Thus, it is argued that with improved mortality conditions couples would tend to limit their reproduction, since a small number of births would be sufficient to assure continuity of the family name and survival of one or two children to support the parents during their old age.
Keyfitz (1977a, Chap. 18) describes the use of Branching Process for studying extinction of family name. The East-West Population Institute (1975) presents data on continuity of family name as one of the values of having children expressed by couples. Not much work has been done to

study the effect of fertility and mortality levels on extinction of family name; hence, an attempt is made here to examine this effect.
Relatively more work has been done on the relationship between child mortality and fertility. However, there is only limited empirical support for the hypothesis that the reduction of child mortality is a necessary and perhaps sufficient condition for fertility decline (for detailed discussion, see Preston, 1978). Taylor et al. (1976) state that it is "naive for anyone to suggest that the postulated fertility reduction attributable to increased child survival expectations might compensate fully for the population growth effects of reduction in child mortality." Heer and Smith (1968) have applied simulation technique to this problem and find an inverted Ucurve in the growth rate. Preston (1978) describes recent work in this area of study. A simple mathematical model is proposed in this paper to study the effect of the combination of mortality and fertility on the

probability of a couple having a certain number of children who survive until the parents reach old age.
THE MODEL If the force of mortality is M at age t, then

Therefore, the conditional probability of having a girl at the age intervaly toy + Ay, and not at any other age, is
[exp - JOI mIdt- JIy +A.y m' .dJtimyAJy.

By letting Ay-> 0, we obtain

is the probability that a newborn will survive to age x. Let mxAx be the probability of a woman aged x having a daughter in the age interval x to x + Ax. Let a and (3 be the lowest and the highest age reproduction, respectively, and let m,be a continuous function of x. Let us also assume that all individuals are subject to the same mortality and fertility rates and that fertility and mortality are independent.
Given the above, Krishnamoorthy (1979) derived the expression for the probability that a woman aged x exactly will have a specified number of children born to her. First, let us find the expressions for the probabilities that she will have no daughters, that she will have exactly one daughter, and that she will have exactly two daughters. Then we will describe the general case of a woman having r daughters.
The probability that a woman aged x will have no daughter born to her is

-Jo tntdt\mdy.
Integrating this quantity over the range 0 to x, we get the probability of a woman having one and only one daughter at any age before x. Hence, the probability of a woman aged x having only one daughter born at any age in her life is
£(1,*) = exp - Jo mtdt J Jo mydy.
Now, let us denote
J() mydy as \(x).
To find the probability of a woman having two daughters ever born, following the same argument as above, we can write the probability of a woman having two and only two daughters before age x as

£(0,*) = exp [ - Jo m,dt\,

by the same argument used for deriving lx with M, as the force of mortality.
To derive the expression for the probability of having only one daughter let us note that the probability of a woman having a daughter in the small interval of agey to y + Ay =£ x is my Ay and the probability of not having a girl at any other time in her life is

We have 2! in the denominator because it does not concern us whether girl A or girl B is born at the given time. Hence, in general, the probability of a woman aged* having exactly r daughters in her lifetime

PROBABILITY OF EXTINCTION OF FAMILY
Now, consider only the female population, and let a set of probabilities E(0), £(1), E(2), . . ., be that a woman has no daughters, one daughter, etc. If s is the probability of extinction, then (Keyfitz 19776, p. 332)

where 5d*is the fraction of deaths in a life table between ages* and* + 5 and F(t) is the age-specific female birth rate for women of aged between t and t + 5.
For the purpose of illustrating the effect of fertility and mortality on extinction of family, we consider three populations with differing fertility and mortality levels. Madagascar is chosen for high fertility and high mortality; Venezuela, for high fertility and low mortality; and the United States, for low fertility and low mortality. The data for these countries are drawn from the works of Keyfitz and Flieger (1971). Summary measures of fertility and mortality, together with probability of extinction, are given in Table 1.
From Table 1, we observe that the United States has the highest probability of extinction of family heirs. Though Venezuela has the lowest probability, a girl in Venezuela still has a 16 per cent chance of having her family line eventually become extinct. Opinion surveys in some developing countries have shown that women de-

sire a large number of children in order to have their family name continued. But our analysis shows that any amount of reduction in mortality is not going to reduce the probability of extinction closer to zero. Also, for most of the developed countries like the United States with low fertility and mortality, the probability of extinction is still high. Hence, it is implied that even at the lowest mortality level, only a moderate reduction in fertility is possible as long as couples want to have their family name continued.

NUMBER OFLIVING CHILDREN AT A GIVEN AGE
Given that a woman is aged x, what is the probability that shewill have exactly A: living daughters? If the woman had a daughter at agey2 x, then the probability of that child surviving to the mother's age x islx.r Since the force of maternity ism at agey, we can define my lxy as the effective maternity. Following closely the argument for E{r,x), we can show that the probability of a woman aged x having exactly k living daughters is

Given the life table and the age-specific fertility rates, we can compute the probability of a mother aged* having a specified number of living daughters. We can also compute the probability that there are at least / surviving daughters at age x of mother. In order to compute these quantities from observed age-specific birth and death rates, we need a numerical procedure only for t](x) as long asx is in multiples of five. The approximation used in this paper is

where 5L,is the person years lived per person in a life-table (stationary) population between ages t and t + 5.
Since lxMxdx is the probability that a newborn will die between ages x andx + dx, multiplying Equation (5) by l$lxdx and integrating over the entire agespanof life, we get the probability that a female just born will have k surviving daughters at the time of her death:

or a boy is 0.5, the same probability can be interpreted as the chance of having at least one surviving son. Such an interpretation implies that a combination of low mortality and high fertility, like that found in Venezuela, is necessary for a woman aged 60 to be about 95 per cent confident of having at least one living son. Moderate fertility and low mortality can achieve about 85per cent confidence. The implication of such a finding is that, if couples depend on children for their old age security, one may expect only a moderate decline in fertility to follow the decline in mortality. Alternate sources of old age security seem to be inevitable in such societies in order to induce a fertility decline to the replacement level.

be more complicated. The simple model proposed is expected to be sufficient for the purpose of this inquiry, and the author believes that the findings may not be far different from those obtained from more elaborate models.
The following helps to illustrate the approximation involved in the model's assumption: First, let us assume that the fertility rate is/per year and that a woman can have only one child in a year. This allows for some interval between successive births. If women experience the same fertility rate forn years, at the end of the period the probability that a woman has had r births is, by binomial theorem,

LIMITATIONS OF THE MODEL
The model assumes independent probabilities of birth and death at each moment. Obviously a minimum time interval exists between successive births, due to length of gestation, post-partum amenorrhea, waiting time to conceive, etc. A model that incorporates these factors will

Now as «->°o(for n sufficiently large), Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution is valid. Since women have a reproductive period of about 25 years, we can see that Poisson distribution is approximated.
We also assume that the probability of occurrence of a birth does not differ for

women of different birth order. This assumption may be true in a natural fertility population; but in a population where family limitation is widely practiced, the model will overestimate the probability of extinction and the probability of having no living daughters. In such circumstances, age and parity-specific birth rates may be used. Increment-decrement life table models (Oechsli, 1975; Schoen, 1975;Rogers, 1975) are appropriate for analyzing such data. It is easy to recognize a situation where the next birth depends more on the existing living children than on children-ever-born. Such elaborations could be handled by computer simulation. Unfortunately, such population data are not usually available so that detailed models including computer simulations have had to depend on hypothetical data. Hence, the proposed model, although it might produce biased results because of its naive assumptions, has the great advantage of being applied to real data.
The assumption that the rates of birth and death remain constant between successive generations implies a stable population. This assumption reduces the relevance of the model for many developing countries. The model could still be useful in comparing two stable conditions even though applications to dynamic situations are not possible.
Sterility and marriage are two more important factors which differentiate women with respect to fertility. Although they are not taken into consideration in this study because of the limitations of the data, they can easily be incorporated in the model with minor modifications.

Evaluating at 8 = 0, we have

This result can be interpreted as follows: A small but finite 8 times increase in maternity function will result in an increase of the amount of 8 times the probability of having one and only one surviving daughter in the probability of having at least one surviving daughter.

CONCLUSION
The model proposed is essentially a nonhomogenous Poisson process which assumes that disjoint intervals of ageact independently with respect to births and death. The limitations of the model have been discussed in the text. However, the results of the simple model presentedmay not befar different from those based on an elaborate model. The probability of the eventual extinction of a family is lowonly with the combination of a high birth rate and a low death rate. This finding suggests that if continuation of family is a decisive factor in a population, reduction in fertility will notfollow a reduction in mortality.

On theother hand, a reasonable probability of at least one surviving son can be achieved by a moderate birth rate and a low death rate. This finding implies that if people depend on their children for old age security, a reduction in mortality can be followed by a reduction in fertility, but not to the replacement level. In such a situation alternate sources of old age security need tobeprovided for the population to reach replacement level fertility. Because of the assumptions in themodel, the probability of extinction andthe probability of having no living daughters are overestimated for a population where family limitation is widely practiced. Therefore, the relationship between childhood mortality andfertility is understated.
