ABSTRACT: When a family has a member affected by a rare lethal genetic disease, the normal members of the family have a reduced chance of marrying or of reaching the fertility level of the general population. This paper shows that gene frequency change is divided approximately into two parts: the change due to individual selection and that due to social pressure. It is also shown that a large progeny size in a family generally decreases the equilibrium of lethal genes because of social pressure.

In human populations, it has often been observed that family structure has an important role in the determination of fitnessof an individual. Huntington's disease is an example. Reed and Neel (1959) showed that when a family has affected individuals selection operates against all the sibs even those with normal genotypes.
Such social selection has been studied mathematically for rare deleterious genes (Yokoyama, 1980; Yokoyama and Templeton, 1980). We have shown that social selection has an important role in the population dynamics of deleterious genes and that the equilibrium gene frequency depends strongly on the magnitude of social selection.
In these papers, we have assumed that each family has a large number of offspring. However, progeny size is often limited and the variance in progeny size could be substantial. Therefore, it is important to know the effect of variable progeny size on the population dynamics of rare deleterious genes. In this paper, I shall consider the population dynamics of lethal genes under the joint effect of individual selection and social selection with variable progeny sizes.

DETERMINISTIC CHANGE OF GENE FREQUENCIES
We consider a mutant gene a and its wild type allele A in a population. We assume that only individuals of genotype aa develop the trait. Let us consider the processes of mating, reproduction, and selection, in that order. Let us distinguish five classes: (1) a group of individuals of genotype AA who have no affected individuals within the nuclear family, (AA),; (2) those whose genotypes are AA, but have at least one affected individual within the nuclear family, (AA)2; (3) those of genotype Aa who have no affected family members, 04a),; (4) those of genotypes Aa who have at least one affected individual within the family, (Aa)2; and (5) those of genotypes aa who are phenotypically abnormal, (aa).
In individual selection, we assume that the relative viabilities of the genotypes AA, Aa, and aa are 1,1-h and 0, respectively. Suppose that the frequencies of genotypes AA ,Aa, and aaafter individual selection are P, Q, and R, respectively. Let q be the frequency of allele a among adults. Thus, P=\-2q, Q = 2q, and

R =0. Furthermore, let kx be the relative frequency of AA individuals who have at least one affected individual in the nuclear family. Similarly, let&2be the relative frequency of Aa individuals in the affected nuclear family. Thus, the frequencies of (AA),, (AA)2, (Aa),, (Aa)2, and (aa) among adults are (l-k,)P, k,P, (l-k2)Q, k2)O, and 0, respectively.
In mating, we assume that the amount of reduction in mating success or in fertility for an individual in the classes (AA)2 and (Aa)2 is w, due to social impact. Since only individuals with genotypes AA and Aa participate in the mating, the newly born individuals can be classified as (AA)2 or (Aa)2 only when they have aa individuals in the family. Thus, the classes {AA)2 and (Aa)2 arise from the matings between two heterozygous individuals. Let us now denote the probabilities of progeny of (AA),,(AA)2, (/4a),, (Aa)2, and (aa) from the matings between two heterozygous individuals as D,, D2, D3, D4, and 0.25, respectively (see Table 1). It should be noted that D, + D2 = 0.25 and D3 + D4 = 0.50. The evaluation of these quantities shall be postponed to the next section, and we shall treat them as constants in the following section.

After some algebra, it can be shown that the frequency of allele a after mating, reproduction, and viability selection, is given by
(1 - h)(\ - wk2)Q q 2P(\-wk]) + (3-2h)(\-wk2)Q

(see also Equation [1] in Yokoyama, 1980).
Putting P=l--2q and Q =2q in Equation (1), we have

EVALUATION OF D2 ANDD4
It is generally accepted that the negative binomial distribution provides agood fit to observed progeny size distribution (e.g.,see Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971). Therefore, we shall assume that the progeny size in each family follows the negative binomial distribution. Let X be the number of offspring in the family. The

Let D.(x) bethe value ofD. for X=x, i =2 and 4. Note that the probabilities of genotypes AA, Aa, and aa from the mating between two heterozygotes are 0.25, 0.50, and 0.25, respectively. Thus, D2(l) = 0 and D4(l) = 0. Let us consider the case of X=2. (AA)2\s produced only when one sib is AA and another is aa with probability 2(0.25)2. Since one of these children belongs to (AA\, D2 (2) = (0.25)2. (Aa)2 is obtained when one sib isAa and another is aa. This probability is (2) (0.50)(0.25). Since one of the two has the genotype Aa, D4(2) = (0.50)(0.25). Continuing the same procedure, we can see that for A ^ x

population isalways finite. It is important, therefore, to study the population dynamics of lethal genes in a finite population. To derive the stationary distribution of gene frequencies in a finite population, we must know the mean, Miq, Viq, of gene frequency change pergeneration (Wright, 1938). In the present case.

The extension of the single locus analysis to common diseases has been done with some restrictions (Yokoyama, 1980). Morton (1978) suggests that about one-sixth ofmental retardation in children of matings of normal parents could be due to rare recessive genes. Suppose that the trait is controlled by rare deleterious alleles at n loci. Let us assume that the trait is expressed whenever an individual has at least one homozygous locus for lethal genes. Then, assuming linkage equilibria among n loci, the mating frequency between two individuals who have at least one heterozygote locus is given by

Suppose that the trait is caused bythe genetic mechanism described here and that the population incidence is0.01. When /J= 0.0, the number of loci, n, is given approximately by 0.01/M = 103for u = 10~5. Because of its restrictive assumptions, thepresent model may not apply to common diseases directly. But,itis possible to consider a similar genetic mechanism for these diseases. For example, the rather high population incidence of schizophrenia maybe explained by the balance between selection and mutation with multiple loci, without assuming an extremely high mutation rate as proposed previously (Book, 1953; Penrose, 1956; Kishimoto, 1957).
In thestudy of social selection, theestimation of w becomes important. So far, not many studies have been done in this area. FortheHuntington's disease data in Reed and Neel (1959), w has been estimated to be about 0.2. (see Yokoyama andTempleton, 1980). Forschizophrenia, Lindelius (1970) has shown that normal sibs of schizophrenic probands have a marital fertility of 83 percent of that in the general population. More recently, Buck et al.
