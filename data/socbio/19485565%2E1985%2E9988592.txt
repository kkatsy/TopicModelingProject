ABSTRACT: Data are reported on ages of menarche, first marriage and first childbirth, migration, venereal disease, birth control, birth spacing and on completed fertility rate in populations of Central Nepal living at low (8,500 feet) and high altitude (12,400 feet). The high-altitude population reported a significantly lower completed fertility rate which could be partly accounted for by later age at marriage and first childbirth and increased birth spacing. Longer post-partum ammenorhea and breast feeding did not account for the increased average pregnancy gap.

Anecdotal observations made by Spanish settlers in South America led to the suspicion that fertility was impaired at high altitude. Physiological studies since the 1930's and more recent demographic analyses of census data, as well as small-scale anthropological expeditions, have tended to show that fertility is lower at high altitude. This is possibly due to the effects of hypoxia and cold, although the exact reasons for the reduction are not entirely clear. Baker and Dutt (1972) and Weitz et al. (1978) have suggested that a fertility rate, much lower than might be expected of a community practicing little birth control, is found among high-altitude populations when compared with similar lowaltitude populations. Further evidence to that obtained from Andean and Nepalese populations has been demonstrated in another South America sample (Abelson, 1976) and in the USSR (Mirrakhinov, 1978). Baker (1978) has concluded that high altitude does indeed limit fertility.
This study attempted to provide some answers to this question by exam-

ining completed fertility rate (CFR) in Highland and Lowland villages in Central Nepal and relating rate differences to age at menarche, age at first child birth, age at first marriage, incidence of venereal disease, birth control (vasectomy or hysterectomy), length of postpartum ammenorhea, and breast feeding.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Two similar populations were compared, the first was that of Muktinath and the nearby villages of Purang and Jharkot which lie at altitudes of 12,200 to 12,400 feet. This group is the highaltitude population. These people originate from Western Tibet and speak Bhotia, a form of Tibetan. The economy relies on agriculture and some trading, the latter activity undertaken by the menfolk who may be away for two or three months in a year. The second population studied was in Larjung and surrounding villages which lie at altitudes of 8,200 to 8,500 feet in Kali Gandaki Valley. These lowland peoples are of

In some ways the finding that differences in CFR are due to average pregnancy gap is not surprising. If total reproductive span is not significantly different between highland andlowland peoples and CFR is reduced in highlanders, then theaverage pregnancygap must be greater.

DISCUSSION
The overall completed fertility rate found in the present study was 4.0. This value is significantly lower than the value reported by Bangham and Sacherer (1980) for a Nepalese sample, and it is also lower than the value reported by MacFarlane (1976) for the Gurungs, a hill tribe in Central Nepal. If nulliparous women are excluded, the overall rate rises to close to 5, which is closer to the value reported by MacFarlane. However, the high-altitude CFR data do not differ significantly from those reported by Weitz et al. (1978) or Gupta (1978). Weitz et al. also demonstrated an effect of cultural factors on fertility.
The high/low altitude CFR difference was highly significant and, in keeping with other Nepalese samples, indicated increased fertility in low altitude peoples. What can account for this observed difference? In an attempt to explain the difference we examined the relationship between CFR and age of menarche, age of marriage, and age of first childbirth as well as considering the effects of migra-

tion, birth control, venereal disease, mortality, and average pregnancy gap.
In this study the mean menarcheal age of 16.4 years, although high by Western standards, is not dissimilar to those found by Bangham and Sacherer (1980, 16.3 years), Pawson (1978, 16.1 years) and Weitz et al. (1978, 16.8 years). However, unlike other studies, this survey failed to show a significant difference between menarcheal age between girls living at moderate altitudes and those living at high altitude. Consequently, the contribution of age of menarche to the explained variance in CFR was less than 1per cent.
The age of marriage and age of first childbirth accounted for over 16per cent of the explained variance in CFR. Lowaltitude women married four and a half years earlier, on the average, than the high-altitude woman, while the interval between marriage and first childbirth was very similar in both groups. Consequently, some of the observed difference in completed fertility can be explained by the difference in marital age but not by the interval between marriageand first childbirth. Our results are

The second part of the study concen-

increase in pregnancy gap. Obviously if breast feeding continues for a longer period in high-altitude women there would be a concomitant delay in recommencement of menstruation. We tested this hypothesis by questioning a younger group of high- and low-altitude women and found no difference in reported duration in breastfeeding or in postpartum ammenorhea.
