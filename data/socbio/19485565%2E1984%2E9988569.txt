ABSTRACT: This paper investigates a late nineteenth-century fertility transition in a predominantly Mormon population of the western United States. A unique set of longitudinal data composed of 31,500 computerized family genealogies is drawn upon to examine a number of problems identified in reappraisals of fertility transition research (Caldwell, 1981; Freedman, 1979). Four subcohorts, differentiated by religious commitment and exposure to urban influences, are examined over the course of the transition. The study presents traditional analyses of subcohort CEB levels, period MTFR's, and m values (Coale and Trussell, 1974) and focuses on a macrosimulation of the fertility transition within the population (Bongaarts, 1976). Despite wide subcohort variation in cross-sectional levels of fertility over time, simulation results suggest a similar absolute longitudinal decline in fertility levels, parity at which contraception was initiated, and maximum birth parities for all four subcohorts. The implications of these results for future analyses and the desirability of individual level data are discussed.

An increasing cumulation of historical demographic studies of the fertility transition from high or "natural" fertility to low or "controlled" fertility has generated a number of new theoretical and methodological arguments concerning the transition (Caldwell, 1976,1978; Teitelbaum, 1975; van de Walle and Knodel, 1980). The interest in developing new approaches to accounting for the fertility transition derives largely from a series of problems associated with the concept of the transition itself. These problems have been succinctly summarized by Freedman (1979) and reflect the findings from an extensive set of studies dealing with the fertility transition in Western Europe. It has also been argued that similar fertility changes are to be observed in areas settled by descendants of Europeans. However, few efforts have been made

to integrate theoretical and methodological refinements resulting from historical European fertility studies in fertility studies of the United States and other areas of European settlement.
Specifically, the lack of empirical confirmation of many traditional notions of fertility change associated with the concept of the fertility transition appears to stem from the analysis of highly aggregated data. Identification of sociocultural or socioreligious subcohorts from more refined data have suggested that culturally similar areas in Western Europe moved together in changing fertility without prime reference to socioeconomic, developmental indices critical to many transition theories (Knodel and van de Walle, 1979). Secondly, given that different levels of fertility are found in a number of different populations which approximate natural fertility

schedules (Dupaquier, 1979), failure to deal systematically with structural or compositional shifts such as differential rates of growth among significant population subgroups results in some level of uncertainty about transition studies which ignore fertility differentials among sociocultural subgroups. Thirdly, Knodel stipulates that the appropriate specification of the fertility transition requires the identification of a change from a state marked by the absence of parity-dependent fertility control-- natural fertility as expressed in particular age patterns of fertility--to a state marked by the presence of paritydependent control in marital unions (1977). Specification of the emergence of parity-dependent control, in turn, requires information on age-specific marital fertility patterns over time.
Because initial shifts from natural to controlled fertility typically occur prior to the availability of effective vital registration systems, studies of such changes usually depend upon village genealogies or upon family reconstitutions. As a general rule, therefore, studies of the shift from natural to parity dependent fertility control are often limited to a few villages or communities, making it difficult to identify change among diverse sociocultural or socioreligious groups. In addition, records are typically community-specific without information on fertility behavior before the resident enters or after he or she leaves a specified set of villages. The researcher is thus not always in a position to distinguish among variations in fertility change which may arise as a result of changing heterogeneities in the subject communities.
The research reported in this paper therefore represents a logical extension and an essential refinement of previous

studies of the fertility transition. First, we are dealing with an American frontier population of the nineteenth century which initially evidenced a natural fertility schedule (Mineau et al., 1979). By implication, the data available for study provide for the essential detail necessary to infer the presence of a natural fertility schedule. Second, we analyze data for this population over a period of slightly more than half a century during which a significant reduction in fertility occurs. Third, we empirically identify significant subcohorts of the populations in terms of theoretically relevant socioreligious variables, and examine subcohort changes in levels and patterns of fertility. Fourth, using a macrosimulation model which allows for subcohort identifications, we examine the extent to which underlying behavioral changes--independent of structural shifts in the population-- explain variations in fertility patterns over time.
This data set is part of a larger research effort described in previous articles (Skolnick et al., 1978; Bean et al., 1978; Mineau et al., 1979) and contains approximately 180,000 computerized Utah genealogies. Briefly, these genealogies are drawn from an archive (Bean et al., 1980) of family group sheets maintained by the Utah Genealogical Society. Those family group sheets selected for inclusion in the computerized database met the criterion of at least one family member having a recorded demographic event (birth or death) on the Mormon pioneer trail or in Utah. The data used in the present analyses consist of 31,500 once-married couples (husband and wife married only once) with the wife born between 1840 and 1899 and known to have survived to at least 49 years of age. The treatment of miss-

ing information and quality controls in our analysis is discussed in Willigan et al. (1982).
Based on analysis of these data, results of macrosimulations will permit more precise description of the emergence of parity-dependent fertility control among four subcohorts of this population. The subcohorts are empirically specified through the use of individuallevel data which enable us to classify the population by religious (i.e., pronatalist) commitment and exposure to urban influences (a proxy measure of urbanization). The rationale for the analytical procedures adopted and the specification of the variables identifying our subcohorts are outlined in the following section.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Caldwell and Freedman argued that the fertility transition in Western societies reflects a series of "superstructure!" (Caldwell, 1981) changes in aspirations for self and children which may be quite independent of macrolevel economic shifts (Freedman, 1979). In either case, these arguments presume the emergency of fertility limitation within families, i.e., parity-dependent control of marital fertility. Various tests have been used to demonstrate the emergence of increasing fertility limitation within families: first, shifts in levels of fertility (van de Walle and Knodel, 1980); second, indirect measures, such as the "/" indices developed by Coale (1969 and used by Caldwell, 1981; Caldwell and Ruzicka, 1978; Knodel, 1977; van de Walle and Knodel, 1980); and third, a more direct measure, Coale. and Trussell's m (1974, 1978a, 1978b) when adequate data are available (Knodel, 1977). We propose a fourth ap-

proach which uses a macrosimulation model developed by Bongaarts (1976) to investigate the collective effect of changing proximate determinants of fertility (Bongaarts, 1978) as well as to test the effect of implied contraceptive use and efficacy as an indicator of fertility limitation within families.
The importance of a macrosimulation method which enables testing assumptions about the use and efficacy of contraception or induced abortion1 arises from the fact that modeling can suggest how much of an observed change in fertility arises from: (1) structural demographic changes (changing patterns of marriage and divorce, for example); (2) a shift from ineffectively controlled fertility to more effectively controlled fertility; and (3) a shift from uncontrolled natural fertility to some level of parity-dependent controlled fertility. Changes in fertility behavior due to structural demographic changes may imply no change in preferences and values attached to children. Similarly, shifts from partial to more effective control may be independent of changes in preferences and values related to number of children desired. Only in our third case of parity-dependent control are we dealing with a clear-cut pattern of changing motivation toward achieving lower family size. Consequently, we have adopted a macrosimulation approach to investigate changing fertility patterns. We use individual-level data over time to apply the model to subcohorts , initially identified as part of a natural fertility population, and then to subsequent cohorts marked by declining levels of fertility.
1Given the values of the LDS religion, we assume induced abortion to be nil throughout.

data associated with the place of birth3 of the first and last child in the family. With these data, we identified two groups: (a) settled/central-area residents, those families in which both the first and last child were born in the central Mormon settlement areas of Utah Territory, now Salt Lake County, Utah County, and Weber County4 (hereafter for simplicity identified as theCentral Area subcohort). (b) mobile/noncentral-area residents, those families who either experienced both first and last births in an agricultural-settlement area, or were residentially mobile in thatfirst and last birth were not both in the central area. This category includes families who began their childbearing before moving to Utah (hereafter identified as the NoncentralAreas subcohort). The residential exposure variable may be conceived as a proxy measure of modernization associated with urbanization, reflecting therefore the type of macrolevel variable presumed to cause a fall in marital fertility in traditional fertility transition theory.
3FamiIy group sheets used in our study record city, county, state, and country of birth for each family member.
4It is inappropriate to identify the central areas as purely urban because of the early concentration of agricultural activities even in these areas. Also because families who migrate out and return would be included in this definition of settled central, we looked at all other children's birthplaces. For 90.43 per cent of settled central families, all children with a recorded birthplace were born in the central area; 4.87 per cent had one birth outside, 2.31 per cent had two, and 2.4 per cent had three or more births outside. Because the movement of families with larger numbers of children are more likely to be recorded, we specified thisby number of children ever born. For families with 1 to 3, 4 to 6, 7 to 9, 10 to 12, and 13 or more children, 98.5 per cent, 90.6 per cent, 87.3 per cent, 82.9 per cent, and 81.4 per cent (respectively) had no outside births.Thus, the stable/central category does represent a quite consistent living pattern; even for the largest families, 91.75per cent have 11 or more births in the central area.

These two variables provided us with the most parsimonious explanation of the variations in subcohort levels of fertility. Therefore, the next step in our analysis is to use measured and/or estimated parametric values for the proximate determinants of fertility and fertility control within the four significant subcohorts to model the Utah fertility transition.
In summary, in this paper, we use the Bongaarts macrosimulation model (1976) which enables us to include subcohort specifications of proximate fertility deteminants to reproduce the observed fertility transition. Because macrosimulation methods employ a somewhat different approach to the analysis of the fertility transition, we first present alternate methods to examine the presumed emergence of rational fertility limitation within families which will provide a basis for comparison with other studies. This brief analysis is also a necessary prelude to specifying simulation assumptions. We then present the results of the macrosimulation enabling us to model the shifts in proximate determinants of fertility among these subcohorts of the population.

hort to the fertility level observed for the 1895-99 cohort is -37.8 per cent, still the smallest proportionate change among our four subcohorts. Nevertheless, by the time the 1895-99 cohorts have completed their childbearing, the Noncentral Area residents have the highest fertility levels, and religious commitment appears to have little, if any, effect. The Endowed and the NonEndowed have roughly the same fertility levels within the same residence classes. The proportionate decline is approximately equal for the Central Area residents, although the more committed--the Endowed--start at a higher level, and the last subcohort has a somewhat higher CEB level (4.18) than the last birth cohort among the NonEndowed, Central Area residents (3.81). These data would suggest that the influence of exposure to the more

urban, commercial, central areas over time has a greater impact on fertility

change than does religious commitment.6
In the second panel of Table 1 we present data on the marital total fertility rates (MTFR) computed from period data. We do not compute rates for periods prior to 1885-89 in order to limit calculations to birth cohorts (1840-44 and subsequent) who would have been completing their childbearing during our observation period. We also terminate our calculations with the time period 1915-- 19 since cohorts selected for study end with women born in 1899, and the period rates would be incomplete beginning in 1920 (see Bean et al., 1978). In this panel we present data separately for the age groups 15^9 and 20-49 because the age-specific fertility rates of the 15-19 age groups increase almost uniformly over time, while the rates for all other age groups decrease. The increases among the 15-19 age groups may reflect two factors. First, the age at marriage was increasing so that the average level of fecundability of those married in this group may have been increasing, since it is known that fecundability increases with age to a peak in the early 20's. Secondly, health conditions for the population were improving over time so that fecundability might have been improving disproportionately in the younger group.
The changes observed in MTFR are generally consistent with the changes in CEB, although truncating the observation period results in differences in levels. Over a period of thirty years, the greatest amount of change was found among the Central Area subcohorts and

the least among the Noncentral Area subcohorts. Considering only MTFR's computed across the age range 20-49, the Endowed/Noncentral residents maintain the highest level of fertility, and the Non-Endowed/Central residents maintain the lowest. Within the two types of residential areas, the Endowed have higher fertility than the Non-endowed; within religious commitment groups, the Central Area residents have lower fertility than the Noncentral Area residents. Of more importance, however, is the observation that the proportionate rate of change is about equal for the two religious commitment groups within each of the two residential area groups.
The importance of the subcohort time series data should be obvious. Cross-sectional data would suggest that religious commitment and residential area exposure have important independent effects on fertility levels. Yet the changes over the thirty years of period data indicate that the religious effect is mediated by the exposure to community residential-area influences.7 One also notes an important factor by comparing the period and cohort rates. The women born in 1895-99 are only commencing their childbearing during 1915-19 and do not terminate their childbearing until the period marked approximately by the outbreak of World War II, experiencing the later years of childbearing during the great Depression when fertility rates throughout the United States were very low. Therefore, the women born during 1895-99 who were Endowed and lived in Noncentral Areas must have limited their childbearing at a fairly substantial

rate during their later years in order to achieve a CEB approximately equal to that observed for the Non-Endowed, Noncentral Area residents.8
The results of this section go somewhat beyond traditional analyses of fertility levels in that they examine fertility changes within empirically-derived population subgroups. However, as noted above, the fertility indices presented do not adequately examine the age patterns of fertility or the parity-dependent nature of fertility changes. In the next section we present a macrosimulation approach to resolving these difficulties.
SIMULATION PROCEDURES AND RESULTS
The methods and results presented in this section extend earlier simulations of the natural fertility period of the Mormon population to encompass the significant groups and process involved in the transition to fertility control. As in previous simulations of age-specific fertility rates during the natural fertility period (Willigan et al., 1982), the simulation model used was Bongaarts' (1976). One reason for selecting the Bongaarts model over others (Leridon, 1977; Crafts and Ireland, 1975) is its ability to incorporate population subcohorts over the course of the fertility transition.
The Bongaarts model requires a number of input parameters in estimating the distribution of birth intervals, the family-building pattern of marriageduration-specific births, and finally the age-order-specific birth rates. A major-
8The somewhat greater decline among the two Endowed groups for the MTFR for age groups 1549 may well be due to declining rates of marriage for young (15-19) highly committed LDS women, arising from a shift toward a greater use of young males as missionaries, thus creating a temporary constriction on the marriage market.

ity of these parameters, including the proportion ever marrying and remarrying, initial and mean age of marriage, age-specific divorce and widowhood rates, fecundability and risks of spontaneous abortion, and mean infecundability associated with sterility, spontaneous abortion, and the post-partum period, have been previously presented for birth cohorts of Mormon women born between 1840 and 1899, and the sensitivity of the model to these estimates assessed (Willigan et al., 1982). However, earlier simulation analysis was restricted to a natural fertility case and all contraceptive parameters were artificially given null valves. In the present effort, several additional parameters necessary to simulate the transition to patterns of fertility control are provided, and simulation curves are fitted for the fertility transition following the 1860 birth cohort.
In this analysis, the four structural subcohorts above are integrated into the Bongaarts model through empirically estimating the proportionate size of each subcohort in each of thefive-year birth cohorts between 1840 and 1899. For each subcohort entered in the simulation model, three additional parameters are needed to specify contraceptive use and portray the transition to control: contraceptive efficacy, parity at which contraceptive use is initiated, and maximum parity for members of the subcohort.
Following Bongaarts, contraceptive efficacy was assumed equal across all subcohorts, and estimates were derived by adjusting the overall level of efficacy to adequately reproduce observed rates. In his initial presentation of the simulation model, Bongaarts referred to the birth order at which this contraceptive efficacy was initiated as the "desired family size." Because this terminology is

In the original Bongaarts model it was also assumed that the maximum parity for any woman was simply three births beyond the parity at which she initiated contraception. While this assumption has proved plausible for populations where contraception is absent or minimal (Willigan et al., 1982; Bongaarts, 1976), it is clearly not suited to fertility-limiting populations where contraceptive spacing may be utilized or where highly variable childbearing patterns are present. Since the assumption was initially incapable of simulating the transition in the Mormon population, the Bongaarts model was modified to allow input of the maximum parity as a pa-

maximum parity to ten births greater than initiation of contraception (12,13, 11, 12, respectively). Thus the results for the 1870-74 birth cohort suggest a low-level contraceptive efficacy spread over a wide range of parities. In contrast, for the 1890-94 birth cohort, estimated contraceptive efficacy is 80 per cent, introduced at three births prior to mean CEB and with a maximum parity of six births beyond initiation of contraception. These changes indicate an increasing limitation of fertility as contraceptive efficacy increased and a wider range of contraceptive spacing than anticipated by the original Bongaarts model.

A contraceptive efficacy of 50 per cent implies that one-half of the fecund women who would have conceived may avoid conception for one month, onefourth for two months, only 12.5 per cent for three months, and so on. The resultant increases in mean birth intervals would then be limited to only several months. Second, to the extent that our simulation estimates are valid, the results of Figures la and 2b suggest that the Mormon population initially experienced low-level contraceptive use spread over a wide parity range. However, the population radically shifted to a high-efficacy pattern of limitation within an extremely short time span. It is this radical onset of parity-dependent limitation which can be said to "account" for the fertility transition within the population. Equally important is the fact that other proximate determinants of fertility are controlled for in this analysis. Changes in age of marriage, proportions married, and widowhood, among others, for example, cannot ac-

count for the changes observed. The clear suggestion of these results is that the Utah fertility transition was a result of a fundamental behavioral shift toward fertility limitation which emerged at about the same time among different subgroups within the society with different initial levels of fertility.
In any use of simulation models it is possible to introduce artificial results through the method chosen to fit simulation parameters. The relatively uniform decrease in initial contracepting parities and maximum parities (Figures 3 and 4) might be suspected to be a result of the way in which these parameters were fit. Rather than subtracting or adding constant parities from the mean completed family size of all four subcohorts simultaneously, one might attempt to fit each subcohort individually. However, centering limitation parameters upon mean CEB encompasses any shifts in the role of subcohorts over the course of the transition (i.e., the increasing role of modernization). And, as noted above,

the relatively parallel declines in fertility levels of the four subcohorts (Figures la and lb) appear to substantiate largely uniform longitudinal adoption of fertility limitation in achieving these fertility levels. To further verify the relatively uniform adoption of fertility limitation within the four subcohorts, marital age* specific fertility rates are used to calculate the indices of m and M which are presented in Table 3.9 Coale and Trussell suggest that the parameter m indicates the degree of control of marital fertility while M is a scale factor for the underlying level of fertility. These estimates are readily interpretable if one observes a series over time. "For exam-

pie, if one observes a monotonic rise in m over time from --0.08 to 1.0, then an estimate of 0.2 in this sequence would evidence control" (Coale and Trussell, 1978, p. 205). The change in m values across the birth cohorts substantiates the dramatic and largely uniform onset of fertility limitation portrayed by simulation results.
The m values as indices of control simply provide complementary evidence. All four subcohorts evidence consistent increases in the values of m over time. The Non-Endowed, Central Area residents appear to achieve a level of control somewhat earlier than other groups and evidence the greatest amount of change in the m values (1.319). The Endowed, Central Area subcohort also evidences a substantial increase in m (0.924). Consistent with the changes in CEB and MTFR, the changes in the levels of control are

somewhat lower in our two Noncentral Area subcohorts: 0.846 for the Endowed and0.840 for the Non-Endowed. These data are also consistent with the parameter estimations incorporated in the macrosimulation. Initial contracepting parities are generally lowest for the Non-Endowed, Central Area residents; and maximum birth order is generally estimated as lowest for this group as well.
Finally, the three new parameters estimated--parity at which contraception is initiated, maximum parity, and contraceptive efficacy--have distinctive effects on the simulated fertility rates and were thought to provide approximately unique solutions. Simulated fertility rates are graphed alongside ob-

served age-specific rates for four representative birth cohorts in Figure 5. These plots clearly demonstrate the precision with which the specified parameters reproduce observed fertility patterns. To assure that no other combination of parameters could more adequately simulate the observed rates, an additional 312sensitivity analysis trials were performed, altering parameter values and examining the effects of these alterations.
The apparent uniqueness of solutions presented was substantiated by the failure of any parameter alterations to obtain a more adequate fit. This sensitivity analysis continues to assume a parallelism in the use of contraception within groups. Without this empirically sup-

ported assumption the simulation admittedly degenerates into an infinite number of plausible solutions. However, given this specification, it is possible to support the fitted values obtained for other simulation parameters within subcohorts. In Table 4 the sensitivity analysis results for the 1885-89 birth cohort are presented. In this analysis, contraceptive efficacy was varied by 20 per cent and both parity of initial contraceptive use and maximum parity were increased or decreased by two births. Since hypothetical rates without denominator populations are produced by the simulation, a paired /-test was used to compare the simulated and observed fertility rates for each change of parameters.
In addition to our fitted simulation

However, two of these possible solutions (--0.23, 0.42), with maximum parity decreased by two and contraceptive efficacy decreased by 20 per cent, are inadmissible. For these specifications, the maximum birth orders of the four subcohorts in Table 2 would be clearly understated, approximately one birth beyond the average number of births. The third possible fit (0.69) results from simply increasing maximum parity by two births. However, this fit is no better than that provided by the parameters of Table 2. If, however, thissolution were adopted, the impact on our results is simply to increase the range of births over which contraception is used. Thus, these sensitivityfindings,and sim-

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have presented the results of a detailed approach to the

analysis of fertility transitions made possible through access to an unusual body of individual-level longitudinal data. These data refer to the changes in the fertility levels and patterns of a population settling on the American western frontier, essentially Utah. The population in some respects differs from other

population groups by being composed largely of members or ancestors of members of the LDS church which has been correctly identified as a pronatalist church with notably high levels of fertility. The evidence which we have presented in this paper clearly indicates that during the early periods of observation, noted as the period of natural fertility, commitment to a pronatalist religion may be related to differences in levels of fertility, but not longitudinal patterns of fertility decline. By the end of our observation period, variables more traditionally associated with the fertility transition in Western Europe, consistent long-term secularization and exposure to urban influences, appear to be more important determinants of crosssectional fertility levels and longitudinal changes in fertility levels among our four subcohorts. Consequently, the utility of the data base for the analysis of an observed "fertility transition" enables us to examine certain of the criticisms of the fertility transition arguments based to date largely on analysis of European populations.
Before considering the implications of our findings, it is useful to recapitulate. Taking into account the classical transition theory argument that the fertility transition "ought" to be related to changes in modernization variables such as urbanization, and recognizing that previous research has demonstrated that areas which were culturally similar moved together in changing fertility, we have examined the fertility changes among four distinctive subcohorts in our population distinguished in terms of religious commitment and exposure to central, urban areas. Examination of changes in CEB and MTFR indicates that within a relatively brief period of time, the changes in levels of fertility

among these four subcohorts were substantial and dramatic. Over 12 five-year birth cohorts, the levels of CEB decreased between 21.5 and 54.0 per cent. Over a period of thirty years the MTFR period rates declined between 22.5 and 29.7 per cent. Changes in m values were also consistent. All four subcohorts adopted a pattern of increasing fertility limitation at about the same time, and the increase in control suggested by increasing magnitudes of m was also substantial, with some variation among our four subcohorts. Primary differences in levels of fertility observed among natural fertility cohorts shifted from religious to urban differences over the course of the transition, but were small compared to the remarkable similarity in the timing of the adoption of control within subcohorts and the uninterrupted trend of increasing fertility limitation.
The significance of our use of the Bongaart's macrosimulation is that it enables us to analyze several proximate determinants of fertility simultaneously and to introduce contraceptive parameters for each of the four subcohorts separately while controlling for changes in the structural composition of the population. This analysis allows us to confirm that the observed pattern of fertility for the population of once-married females as a whole can only be reproduced by taking into account these three parameters and their values for the four subcohorts. This analysis also suggests that contraceptive parity-dependent spacing may have played a major role in the Utah fertility transition. Consequently, we are confident that the changes in fertility represent a significant behavioral shift reflecting dramatically increasing parity-dependent control of fertility within marriages. In addition, our simulation of fertility behavior strongly sug-
