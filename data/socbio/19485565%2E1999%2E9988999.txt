Harry Lionel Shapiro, curator emeritus of physical anthropology in the Department of Anthropology at The American Museum of Natural History passed away January 7, 1990. Dr. Shapiro was born in Boston, Mass., on March 19, 1902. He graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. degree from Harvard University in 1923, and received a Master's degree from Harvard in 1925 and a Ph.D. degree in 1926.
Dr. Shapiro's major research was in physical anthropology and human biology, including the areas of race mixture and population, and he made important contributions to the public understanding of anthropological theories through his activities in exhibition, teaching, and publication. He conceived and supervised the preparation of the Hall of the Biology of Man, which opened at the Museum in 1961.
His association with the Museum began in 1926 when he was appointed assistant curator in the Department of Anthropology. He became associate curator in 1931 and was chairman and curator of physical anthropology from 1942 until his retirement in 1970.
Before joining the Museum, Dr. Shapiro was a Thaw Fellow and tutor in anthropology. He began teaching at Columbia University in 1938 and was professor of anthropology from 1943 to 1974. As a consultant to the American Graves Registration Command, he went to Europe in 1946 to set up a method for identifying unknown dead that served as a basis for subsequent identification work in all theaters of war.

Dr. Shapiro's field work was extensive. In 1923, when he was unable to get to Pitcairn Island, he undertook a pioneer genetic study of the descendants of the Bounty mutineers (1789) living on Norfolk Island. He reached Pitcairn successfully in 1934 and remained through 1935, completing his study of the race mixture that resulted from marriages between Bounty sailors and Tahitian women. These studies are described in his book The Heritage of the Bounty.
In 1927 he did field work in archeology and physical anthropology in the Dominican Republic, and in 1928 in New Mexico. He participated in several population studies dealing with the physical anthropology, race mixtures, and genetics of such areas as Polynesia (1929-30, in cooperation with the Bishop Museum of Hawaii); Point Hope, Alaska (1941); and Puerto Rico (1947-48, a socio-biological study). Dr. Shapiro's research during the 1940s helped lay the foundations for forensic anthropology, and he frequently assisted the New York City medical examiner's office in identifying homicide victims. In 1956 he conducted an American Museum expedition to study the archeology of the Marquesas.
In 1965 Dr. Shapiro made the first of three trips to India at the invitation of the Indian Statistical Institute to establish research programs and studies in human biology with the cooperation of members of its staff. One study concerned the biological responses of man to conditions of extreme crowding in Calcutta.
Dr. Shapiro designed and supervised The American Museum's Centennial Exhibition, "Can Man Survive?", the first

multi-media environmental exhibit in a museum. It opened at the beginning of the Centennial Year in 1969 for a twoyear run.
Dr. Shapiro's books include The Heritage of the Bounty (1936), Migration and Environment (1939), Race Mixture (published by UNESCO in 1953), Aspects of Culture (1957) and The Jewish People, a Biological History (1961). He edited Man, Culture and Society (1956) and wrote a large number of scientific papers and articles for professional and popular publications.
In 1964 Dr. Shapiro received the Theodore Roosevelt Distinguished Service Medal for his contributions to science. He was a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences and a member of its council from 1957 to 1960. He was a member of the American Anthropological Association (president, 1948), the American Association of Physical Anthropologists (secretary, 1935-39, and vice-president, 1941-42), the American Eugenics Society (president, 1955-64), the American Ethnological Society (president, 194243), the New York Academy of Sciences (chairman of the anthropology section, 1939), and the editorial advisory board of the National Academy of Sciences. He

served as chairman of the division of anthropology and psychology of the National Research Council and was an associate of the Bishop Museum in Honolulu for many years. In 1964 he was elected honorary fellow by Die Anthropologische Gesellshaft in Vienna.
Dr. Shapiro was the Brown and Haley Lecturer, College of Puget Sound, in 1956; the tenth A. Walter Suiter Lecturer, New York Academy of Medicine, in 1958; the eleventh Herman L. Reiss Memorial Lecturer, New York Institute of Clinical Oral Pathology, in 1962, and first Burke Lecturer, Thomas Burke Memorial Washington State Museum, University of Washington, in 1964.
After his retirement in 1970, Dr. Shapiro maintained offices at the American Museum and took an active role in its department of anthropology.
He continued his celebrated studies on Peking Man, and in 1974 authored a book entitled Peking Man. In September of 1980, he was invited to China as a guest of the Institute of Human Paleontology, where he went to research new clues on the origins and validity of Peking Man.
In 1977, the New York Academy of Science gave Dr. Shapiro an award for his distinguished service to science.
