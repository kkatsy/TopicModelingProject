This paper is an attempt to describe the demography of the Shirishana of Brazil during a fifteen-year period beginning immediately following their contact with civilization in 1957. Prior to that period, they had lived in complete isolation from Westerners and in isolation from other Indian tribes for at least two decades. Demographic study of the Shirishana yields unique data on fertility and mortality of a preliterate society, particularly during the initial years of Western contact. Such studies are rare because of the difficulty in gathering such data. The demographer is often not present to make such studies at that crucial time of culture contact.
The Shirishana are a primitive people located 3 degrees north latitude and 62 degrees east longitude on the Mucajai River in north Brazil, just 70 miles south of the Venezuelan border. There were 118 people in the tribe in 1957 when they first traveled downstream to make contact with civilization in an effort to obtain metal tools (Peters, 1973). They had lived in total isolation since 1940 or 1941 when, in an attempt to acquire cutlasses and axes from the semidvilized Carib Maiyongongs, they killed ten people in a series of raids. The Shirishana fled their area of habitation

on the Uraracoiera River and settled near the Mucajai River.
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
It is only recently that demographic studies of nonindustrial societies have become a topic of interest. Two notable exceptions are the works of Carr-Sau.iders (1922) and Krzwicki (1934). Carr-Saunders' writings on fertility in primitive societies can be summarized as follows: (1) the fertility levels of primitives are generally quite low; (2) the primitive society seeks a population level appropriate to its resources and technology; (3) voluntary and involuntary factors such as prepubertal intercourse and prolonged lactation as well as abortion and prolonged abstention from intercourse restrict population; (4) abortion is more frequent among nomadic peoples because of the difficulty of transporting more than one suckling child. Krzwicki does not differ basically from Carr-Saunders, although the former's empirical work indicates that fewer children are born per woman in primitive societies than in preindustrial Europe.
More recently Ford (1945) has made the following significant findings about

primitive peoples: (1) there is a universal concern that the adult woman bear children; (2) abortion and infanticide are performed universally, but strong social pressures limit these practices; (3) almost all societies attempt some method of preventing conception.
Lorimer's work (1954) indicates a grave deficiency in all previous studies of reproduction in nonindustrial societies, because social factors were not adequately considered. Societies with unilineal descent and "corporate" kinship groups were found to tend to generate strong cultural motives for high fertility. From Lorimer's view, social disorganization might increase or decrease fertility, depending upon the "apathetic acceptance of circumstances."
During the past decade, there has been an increased concern to relate social biological factors to demographic studies of nonindustrial societies. Nag (1962) has done a cross-cultural analysis of 61 societies, showing that postpartum abstinence, the period of lactation, venereal disease as well as possibly the practice of polygny are factors which mitigate against high fertility. His analyses do not give evidence that early marriage, premenarcheal sexual relations, or dietary habits affect the rate of fertility with primitive groups. WynneEdwards (1962) focused upon the social context in relation to population, by emphasizing social stress, superstition, availability of food, and social conventions.
In more recent works Kunstadter (1972) and Chagnon (1972) have addressed themselves to social structure and demography in nonindustrial societies. Kunstadter maintains that present-day primitive small communities do not fit the classical "transition" theory due to the small population and effects such as disease and availability of medicines. Chagnon contends that social factors, and in his case, aboriginal warfare and threat patterns constitute a unique

social structure directly affecting the population.
Increasingly, demographers of nonindustrial societies have indicated apprehension about generalizations from present larger societies. Emphasis has increasingly been toward an understanding of social factors. It is directly in this perspective, that of social variables affecting a primitive society, including Western contact, that this paper has been written.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The writer first made contact with the Shirishana in 1958 and remained as a permanent resident in the tribe until early 1967. During this time, the language was learned and reduced to writing, information regarding myths, legends, and folklore was learned, and ethnological data was recorded. Beginning in 1959, a record was kept of all births and deaths. After the writer's absence, other Westerners living with the tribe continued to record births and deaths.
In October, 1972, the writer returned to the Shirishana for two months of concentrated field research, during which time he resided in the Indian communal houses. By means of participant observation and informant work, data was collected in regard to abortion, infanticide, births, and deaths. Inquiry was made with respect to causes of death, marriage, marriage separation, widowhood, sex norms, and perceptions regarding conception. Because of the small population and the writer's previous acquaintance with most individuals in the society, it was possible to extend the information to include statistics of births and deaths beginning at the time of the Shirishana's first contact with Westerners in 1957.
The birth records were used as the basis of calculating the ages of all those born since 1957. The time interval between all

to 36 months to allow for a simple calculation of three year intervals between siblings born before 1957. Since age deference is rigidly observed in the kin structure, it is considered that estimated ages were fairly accurate. Where individuals had no living siblings, informants were able to indicate whether the subject was older or younger when compared to another Shirishana of approximate age.
Data on migration was determined by recall. Informants could identify the arrival of immigrants with other specific events such as the death of a particular individual, or before the arrival of-a new Western family, etc.
RESULTS
AGE-SEX DISTRIBUTION
The author constructed age-sex pyramids for 1957, 1962, 1967 and 1972. There is no resemblance to a stable population, except in the population under 39 years of age in the 1972 pyramid. The trend toward greater stability is due to three factors. First, resident missionaries introduced penicillin and other medicines to combat disease and illness. This was particularly significant during the Shirishana's initial contact, when their resistance to Western diseases such as colds, tuberculosis, whooping cough, and measles was minimal. Second, it is believed that the ideology of the Westerner affected abortion and female infanticide practices. Third, there were relatively few childbearing women in the 1957 and 1962 population. This situation was somewhat altered by the acquisition of non-Shirishana women into the tribe by stealth, raids, or wife purchase.
In 1957 the sex ratio of the total population was 149; but in subsequent fiveyear periods this was decreased to 131, 119, and finally to 108 in 1972. The reduction in female infanticide, plus an immigration population sex ratio of 48 contributed to this balance. Between 1957

have been made on the base population in 1957, 1962, and 1967. The entire population has increased by 58 per cent since 1957.
The first five years saw a decrease in population due to a low birth rate because of few women in the fertile years. At the same time, there was a high death rate partially due to diseases resulting from contact with Westerners, for which the Shirishana had little resistance. The 196367 period had a more normal growth. Immigration was minimal. The 1968-72 period had a high growth rate due to immigration, a high birth rate, and a low death rate.

Although there is no evidence that the fertility rate is higher where polyandry is practiced, it is conceivable that the frequency of coitus is higher in such a marriage form. However, as already indicated, the dominant marriage form changed from polyandry to monogamy between 1958 and 1972.
It is said that conception can be prevented by a woman drinking a particular liquid, or by rubbing a root upon the woman's abdomen. In the former case, the woman may request the drink because she does not want to be bothered with pregnancy or children. The drink was not available prior to the contact in 1960

lactating child to become ill. Sterility of this nature can be made void through the efforts of particular shamans.
Should a man become angry at a married man or a woman, because sex has been denied, he may, in revenge, rub a root upon the woman's abdomen, supposedly causing sterility. This behavior is considered an extremely grave offense, because a woman's fertility is highly valued.
Apart from these "black magic" means of birth control, two other methods are practiced. There is considerable postpartum coitus restraint. An immediate subsequent pregnancy would hinder the development of the lactating infant. Furthermore, should pregnancy occur, the fetus is aborted.
Data were gathered on 31 living women in 1972, and informants indicated that a total of 21 abortions or 0.71 abortions per mother were performed. The majority of these women are still in their fertile years. Abortions are performed for three reasons: (1) when the female is considered to have become pregnant by an undesirable male; (2) when pregnancy occurs before the infant lactating is not yet two years of age; and (3) when pregnancy takes place when the female is still young, usually under 15 years of age. It is believed that early pregnancies will hinder the full development of the fetus in future pregnancies. Abortions are performed by a vigorous hand manipulation of the abdomen or by tramping upon the abdomen when the pregnant woman is prostrated on the ground.
Infanticide was practiced when the infant was considered abnormal, or when a male was desired but a female was born. Although no twins had been born since 19S8, the Shirishana indicated that one of the infants would be killed should twins be delivered. Usually, the husband or close relatives determine whether infanticide will be practiced. It is expected that if the mother has already had two consecutive female offspring and the third is also a

female, the infant will be killed. The women who bear only females are stigmatized. Generally, a pregnant woman who has borne only females wears a necklace or bracelet loaned from another woman who has given birth to several males. This practice is thought to enhance the chances of having a male birth. There is one woman who has had four consecutive female births since 1960 and has not killed one. The father of these girls, although socially pressured to kill the females at birth, adamantly refused to do so because of a strong conviction that this would displease God. This is directly due to the influence of the residing missionaries. The above instance suggests that there may have been a decrease in infanticide since 1958.
When infanticide is practiced, the infant may be thrown into the river, abandoned in the jungle, or choked by placing a stick across the throat and applying pressure to the ends of the stick.
Table 1 indicates the child spacing for all conceptions between 1957-72, including known abortions. The 44 instances of child spacing included all ages of fertile women and covered a range in child spacing from 17 months (a stillbirth) to 70 months. The average spacing was 35.3 months, or approximately three years.
The Shirishana women who are married and have borne children were placed into four categories: young married women, women married eight years or more, recent menopaused women, and aged women. These categories were chosen because some data on infanticide and abortions are not available for the aged; older women are likely to have had more offspring deceased; and younger women will have had the use of medicines during the pre- and postnatal periods. The estimated ages, conceptions, offspring, the living offspring, abortions, infanticides and stillbirths have been listed for each woman (Table 3).

ried in early adolescence, having 21 conceptions (1.9 per female) of which IS are currently living (1.36 per female). The mean age of this group is 19.6 and the age range is 15-24 years. Three deaths, two abortions, and one infanticide were reported.
There are eight women who have been married at least eight years and are still fertile. These eight women had 45 conceptions (5.6 per female) of which 31 off-

springs are living (3.9 per female). The mean age of this group is 29.75 and the age range is 25-36. Five deaths of offspring, seven abortions, one stillbirth, and one infanticide were reported.
There are four in the group of recently menopaused women. They have had 41 known conceptions (10.1 per woman) and have 32 living offsprings (8 per female). The mean age of the group is 46.3 and the age range is 43-48. There was one death,

64

two abortions, three stillborns, and three infanticides reported for this group.
There are four aged married women who raised their entire family in the Shirishana tribe. Actual data on number of conceptions, deaths of offspring, infanticides, and abortions is not known although the author is aware of 14 births, 7 deaths, and 3 (all by one woman) infanticides. Because of the women and offspring living a longer period of time, possibility of death would be greater than in the other three categories. The estimated average age of the mothers is 63 years with a range between 59 and 68.
This table indicates that the number of living offspring per married female has increased since the presence of the Westerner, very likely due to the availability of medicines. There is some evidence of a decreasing rate in infanticide. Actual frequency of infanticide among the aged women is difficult to obtain, and the figures used in Table 3 are considered conservative. It is felt that the Western ideological stance of the value of human life, regardless of sex, has contributed to a decrease in the frequency of infanticide. Although the accessibility of medicines for the Shirishana has prolonged life and presumably reduced the infant mortality rate, the exposure to Western diseases, often acquired from Brazilians living downriver, has shown its toll on the death rate.
MARITAL PATTERNS AND FORMS
It is rare to find a female over six years of age who is not already promised in marriage to a male. Marriage takes place some months after a female has passed puberty. There is no ceremony.
The female expresses great fear of coitus during early marriage, but is encouraged by her mother not to resist the sexual desires of her husband. At the same time, the girl is not to become pregnant because

she is considered extremely young (usually 13 or 14 years). Early pregnancies are said to harm the development of the fetus in future pregnancies.
The male is usually considerably older than the female spouse. Table 4 indicates the age of the living or first spouse. There is an age range of the husband being 49 years older than his wife, to the rare reverse extreme of the wife being 25 years

older than the husband. The average age difference is 12.7 years; the standard deviation, 13.97. In almost all cases, the marriage takes place some four to sixteen months after menarche. Currently, the men are usually between 18 and 24 years in age at marriage, although in one extreme case the husband was 60 years old. Age difference between husband and wife is often greater where the wife has been acquired in a raid. More recent marriages, especially where bride service is involved, show less difference in age between the spouses. The only two known exceptions where the females were not married shortly after puberty occurred when the two eligible men in the tribe proved inappropriate because of hostility between the families. The women eventually married men from another tribe some six years later.
In 1957 there were 14 polyandrous, one polygynous, and two monogamous marriages; in 1972, there were one polyandrous, two polygynous, and 34 monogamous marriages. When there is a great age difference between the spouses, there is high possibility of polyandry occurring. Even in the monogamous unions, coitus outside of the union is socially permissible between the wife and the husband's brother.
Table S indicates the marriage form and known extramarital associations of women who have been married between one and seven years, and more than seven years. This categorization was made because if the marriage form is to change during the woman's fertility, it will likely have taken place during the first seven years of marriage. In the group that had been married seven years or more by 1972, two women were polygynous, one having had rare and one having had no other sexual relationships. The fact that the husband of this polygynous union was a powerful shaman may have contributed to the relative high fidelity. Seven women were monogamous,

two of whom had frequent other sexual relationships, two had rare encounters, and three had virtually no encounters. Factors relating to fidelity were the number of eligible males, the beauty and seductiveness of the female, and the suitor's fear of the husband. Of the women married for more than seven years, eleven had been polyandrous, that is, had at least two men at one time cohabitating with them. In all cases, sexual relations with other men had been frequent.
Among the more recently married, one woman was polyandrous and had no other sexual unions. Two women were polygynous and had rare or no other sexual relationships. Eighteen women were monogamous; two had frequent, four had rare, and twelve had no sexual relationships with other men. Monogamy is much more common among younger women. Polyandry has generally been fraternal and has generally occurred only after two or three children have been born.

The data gathered in field research suggest that approximately eight or nine months may pass before a marriage is likely to "stick." In one such brief union, the male was small in stature, and reportedly afraid of having coitus with his rather stout wife. In two cases, younger brothers of the initial husbands forced the termination of the unions by means of their amorous behavior and acquired the women as wives. In two other cases, the women simply did not desire the men, and so left them. In another instance, the husband died before the girl's menarche. The father then gave the girl to a young man who was making bride price for a younger daughter. The older girl refused coitus with this man, had a series of relationships with other men, aborted at least twice, and eventually fled from the tribe (Peters, 1971). She is now considered sterile.
Marriages initially appear to be somewhat fluid in nature. The spouses may separate after several months of cohabitation, even though months or years of bride payment and bride service have been made. Since 1965 there have been nine separations involving 14 males and females. Five individuals were still single in 1972, although three of these five had marriage prospects. The birth of a child or of children seem to assure the permanence of young marriages. Polyandrous marriages may become monogamous if one of the husbands acquires a new wife. Any marriage could be terminated when the female reaches menopause.
If a widower is young, he is likely to remarry. Widows remarry only if they are still considered fertile, and if there are eligible men available. If the deceased husband was a powerful shaman, his wife may be permitted to marry only his surviving brothers. Otherwise, his spirits would kill his widow. Widows and widowers still experience coitus without marriage. Middle-

aged widows often become desirable mates for younger single men, who seek coitus but not marriage. There is no social stigma against a child born to a widow under these conditions.
A woman who has been acquired through raids is frequently raped in the new community by a number of men, particularly if she is young and attractive. Fights between the men erupt. These sexual relations diminish as one male lays specific claim and shows jealousy toward the woman.
Children that have been born because of polyandrous or other culturally acceptable sex relationships are nurtured by the mother, as well as by the recognized fathers. Even though the progenitor may not reside with the mother, he still may bring game or fish to the mother to cook for his offspring. During times when the child is sick, he will feel responsible to provide adequate food.

Although there was no immigration between 1941 and 1959, immigration in subsequent years had a marked effect upon the age-sex composition in the population. The immigration for the 1960-72 period was 35 and consisted of a sex ratio of 48 for the total immigrant population. Sixteen of these women came as wives for Shirishana men and were of the age of high fertility, thus contributing almost immediately to the natural growth of the population. Ten others had not yet reached puberty at the time of immigration and therefore would eventually contribute to the natural growth rate. Other immigrants were three single men marrying Shirishana women and some younger members of nuclear families.
Of the 18 female immigrants who entered the tribe since 1960 and were immediately married to Shirishana men, seven

were purchased, eight were taken captive in raids, two were stolen, and one was given to avenge a Shirishana male. During the first five-year period, immigrant women produced two offspring. During the subsequent years, the accumulated total was 9 and 27 respectively. Since the majority of these women were below 30 years of age, they will continue to contribute substantially to the natural growth of the population.
There has been one case of emigration, a female of 22 years of age. Her espoused husband died when she was 10 years of age. She disliked the husband subsequently given her (Peters, 1971) and was later in-

DEATHS
Four informants were asked to state the cause of death of 47 of the 53 members of the tribe. Their responses are indicated in Table 6.
A total of 21 deaths were either entirely or partially attributed to spirits. Thisnumber represents 45 per cent of the total deaths investigated. Individuals who consider themselves cursed by a spirit resign themselves to death, showing no effort to regain health. In the event that the death is considered due to enemy witchcraft, as was reported to be the case in at least 13 instances, the desire for revenge stimulates further possible deaths.
Table 7 shows average age at time of death by sex in five-year periods. Except for the 1968-72 period, more males have died than females. The females have died at a younger age than have the males in the 1963-67 and 1968-72 periods.
During the fifteen-year period, there have been two cases of infant mortality in each of the five-year periods of research. These six cases are insufficient to do any analysis on infant mortality rates.
Table 8 indicates frequency of mortality by year and life stage. The death rate is calculated using 1957, 1962, and 1967 as a base, respectively. The first five-year period had a high percentage of deaths in the old-age (45-74) and later adulthood

(25-44) categories. The 1968-72 period had a very high frequency of deaths of children six years of age or younger, most of whom died rather suddenly. In one unusual case, a four-year-old Aica immigrant of a few months was shot, simply because he irritated another twenty-year-old Aica who had immigrated ten years previously. This table does not show the age-specific death rate. The impact of the presence of Westerners has helped reduce the death rate from 42 in the 1957-62 period to a death rate of 16.3 in the 1962-72 period.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The Shirishana could not be considered a stable population during the time of the research. The sex ratio was high, and the percentage of fertile women was low in 1957, mitigating against any sizeable population growth. The initial contact with Brazilians and North Americans exposed the population to diseases for which they had little resistance, further limiting population growth. On the other hand, the availability of penicillin and other antibiotics reduced the death rate considerably. Although there is no conclusive evidence, it is believed that the high rate of infanticide and abortion has decreased since Western contact. Because of the resident missionaries' efforts to contact other tribes, the Shirishana were introduced to other groups.

With the access and availability of Western goods, wives were purchased or stolen, and in some cases, villages were raided. These and other nonviolent forms of migration contributed much to the percentage of fertile women among the Shirishana.
There were not enough post-menopause women in the variant forms of marriage to determine whether polyandry has any significant relationship to rate of fertility. There is also no evidence that magical forms of birth control are effective. Cultural beliefs about conception may affect fertility, in that single acts of coitus are said not to cause conception. Postpartum practices of sexual avoidance do prevent a high fertility.
A contrast of the population pyramid of 1957 and 1972 indicates a closer approximation to a stable population in the 1972 year period. Had the Shirishana been victims in raids, or had they not themselves raided, the pyramid would have been considerably altered. Primitive societies which do not exceed 200 in number fluctuate considerably due to raids and political alliances (Chagnon, 1972), the sex ratio, the availability and use of medicines, and the desire for Western goods.
The research confirms Lorimer's position (1954) that populations in nonindustrial societies cannot be adequately comprehended unless social factors are understood.

Among the Shirishana, this has particular reference to the customs of abortion, infanticide, magical means of contraception, marriage form, kinship structure, and eligible marriage partners, raiding, and the use of black magic in causing deaths. Furthermore, Lorimer also alludes to circumstances which lead to social disorganization such as war and Western contact.
This research affirms Nag's study (1962) indicating the effect on population growth produced by sexual abstinence during the period of lactation. Nag found that only the Yap population in his sample of 61 nonindustrial societies was significantly affected by practices of infanticide. The Shirishana are another.
Both Carr-Saunders (1922) and WynneEdwards (1962) suggest that the maximum population of a society is dependent upon social space and social convention. Their position is difficult to prove empirically. The Shirishanas had a 58 per cent population increase in IS years and find themselves now in five households,

rather than two households as in 19S8. I suggest that the social structure is the prime variable in such segmentation. This area requires further research.
The application of the demographic transition theory to small nonindustrial societies requires further modification. The first period is not considered as being high in births, as recorded for preindustrial Europe (Kundstadter, 1972; Neel, 1970). The second period, during which the birth rate remains relatively the same but the death rate decreases considerably, is dependent upon such factors as degree of exposure to nonindigenous diseases, availability of medical facilities, and the social organization of the primitive society.
