ABSTRACT: Only limited fertility and general reproductive health data exist on American Indians. Using data from the 1987 Montana American Indian Health Risk Assessment, we found that the fertility of American Indians in Great Falls and on the Blackfeet Reservation was similar to blacks in the U.S. and relatively high when compared with fertility of whites in the United States. The influence of the direct determinants of fertility (nuptiality, contraceptive use, and lactation) was very different for the populations examined in this study. Great Falls American Indians and the U.S. black population were similar regarding age at first sexual intercourse (very young), breastfeeding (low prevalence and short duration), planning status of pregnancies (high unplanned), and contraceptive use (only moderate use). In contrast, Blackfeet women on the reservation and the U.S. white population married relatively late, had very high contraceptive use, used efiFective methods of contraception, and had moderately high levels of breastfeeding. However, Blackfeet fertility was much higher than that of whites. Three interrelated reasons are suggested as possible explanations. Blackfeet couples either wanted high fertility, were relatively poor users of family planning methods, or used less effective methods until they had exceeded their desired family size after which time they turned to sterilization. These finds raise numerous questions concerning the social and economic factors that may account for these group similarities and differences. Further studies with much ¡arger data sets are needed to address these issues adequately.

Between now and the year 2000, health improvements for American Indians will depend largely on changes in individual behavior. The Indian Health Service (IHS), in collaboration with Indian tribes, has given high priority to developing health promotion and disease prevention programs. However, thorough baseline prevalence data related to behavioral risks and reproductive health factors for American Indian populations are not available. Existing U.S. national behavioral risk factor and reproductive health survey data sets do not include enough American Indians to fill these data needs. The 1982National Survey of

Family Growth (NSFG) (latest national reproductive health survey of women 15-44 years of age) included only 83 American Indians from throughout the United States from a total of 7,969 interviews.
In developing an appropriate methodology for obtaining the needed baseline prevalence data, IHS recognized that two key problems had to be addressed. First, because only an estimated 25 per cent of American Indians live on reservations, a study design had to be developed to collect prevalence data for both on- and off-reservation Indians. Second, because a large propor-

tion of American Indian households do not have telephones, a face-to-face survey design had to be considered.
To address these problems, the Billings Area IHS Office proposed a study that would include both on- and offreservation Indians and a face-to-face survey design. The targeted population was American Indian men and women 15-49 years old living in two geographic locations of the Billings Area of IHS: the Blackfeet Reservation (on-reservation) and metropolitan Great Falls, Montana (off-reservation). A study was designed to collect information on behavioral risk factors, including hypertension, exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption, as well as reproductive health data covering general maternalchild-health and family-planning topics among American Indians in these two areas. This study, the 1987 Montana American Indian Health Risk Assessment, had the following objectives:
(1) To collect population-based prevalence data related to behavioral risks and reproductive health for American Indian males and females;
(2) To identify subgroups (sex, age, onvs. off-reservation) in special need of health promotion and disease prevention intervention programs;
(3) To collect baseline prevalence data that can be used to follow trends and evaluate interventions.
This paper will focus on the reproductive health data collected from American Indian females in the 1987 Montana American Indian Health Risk Assessment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLING DESIGN
The 1987 Montana American Indian Health Risk Assessment was a health

study designed to include on- and offreservation American Indians. The study population included American Indian women 15-49 years of age, living on the Blackfeet Reservation or residing in Great Falls, Montana. Separate samples were drawn on- and offreservation. The on-reservation sample was drawn from the Blackfeet Tribal Enrollment List; only those with current addresses on the reservation were included. The off-reservation sample was drawn from a list of American Indians in Great Falls, Montana; this list was obtained from the service records of the Native American Center in Great Falls. The Native American Center estimates that 80-85 per cent of all American Indians in Great Falls are on their list. The lists were the most appropriate means available for achieving coverage of both the on- and off-reservation American Indian population in the geographic areas included in this study. A stratified, systematic, random sample was selected from each list.
Each of the subpopulations studied had between 2,000 and 2,200 eligible respondents. The sample drawn from each group was expected to yield about 125 completed interviews. The sample size was limited because of budget constraints and the 6-week time frame for the fieldwork. However, the sample size is sufficiently large to adequately evaluate behavioral health risks and reproductive health behavior in each subpopulation, as well as the feasibility of interviewing on- and off-reservation American Indians.
The interviews were conducted in the home rather than on the telephone or by mail. Nearly 40 per cent of the American Indian households on the Blackfeet Reservation and in Great Falls do not have telephones. All interviewers were

ported being currently married or living in union with someone (Table 2). American Indians in Great Falls had younger singulate mean age at first marriage (SMAM = 20 years) than on the reservation (SMAM = 24 years). These ages compare with 23 years for whites and 26 years for blacks in the United States. Nearly half of each American Indian group had less than a high-school diploma. Both American Indian groups had less education than did whites or blacks in the United States.
SEXUAL EXPERIENCE, FERTILITY, AND
BREASTFEEDING
American Indians, aged 15 to 44 years, both in Great Falls (95 per cent) and on the reservation (90 per cent), were slightly more likely to have had sexual intercourse than were whites (86 per cent) in the general U.S. population, but had about the same likelihood

as blacks (90 per cent) (Table 3). In each age group, Great Falls had the highest rate of sexual experience of the four groups. The bottom panel of Table 3 shows the per cent distribution of age at first intercourse for each group. More than half the American Indians in Great Falls and on the reservation had had sex by age 17; in comparison 28 per cent of whites in the United States had had sex by age 17. The distribution of age at first sex for blacks in the United States was similar to that of the American Indian groups in this study.
Only limited fertility data are available for American Indians in the United States. Most of these data are from the decennial census. The 1980 census shows that American Indians had higher fertility than did whites or blacks in the United States on the basis of data containing the average number of children who were ever born to women aged 35

to 44 years (a measure of completed fertility, Table 4). In the same table, American Indians in Montana show slightly higher estimated completed fertility than all American Indians in the United States (4.2 vs. 3.5 children). Results from the present study show the average number of children ever born to women 35 to 44 years of age on the reservation and in Great Falls to be similar (3.4 vs. 3.3) to that of all American Indians found in the 1980 U.S. census (3.5), but lower than that of Montana American Indians as found in the 1980 census (4.2).
Breastfeeding, as a direct determinant of fertility, lengthens a woman's period of infecundability after a birth and thus can increase the interval between pregnancies. In 1980-81, the incidence of breastfeeding among American Indians in Great Falls was lower than that of whites in the Untied States but similar to that of blacks (Table 5).

Only 25per cent of the mothers in Great Falls breastfed their last child. In comparison, 57 per cent of whites and 24 per cent of blacks breastfed their last child. Forty per cent of the mothers on the reservation breastfed their last child; this number is intermediate to whites and the other two groups. Breastfeeding was most common on the reservation for those women with more than 12years of schooling (53 per cent); this pattern is similar to that found in the United States in the early 1980's.
The next few tables focus on the planning status of the last pregnancy for each woman who gave birth in the 5 years before the survey date. We use planning status to categorize pregnancies by whether they were planned, mistimed, or unwanted. Mistimed pregnancies are timing failures, whereas pregnancies in excess of the number wanted are considered "unwanted." The sum of mistimed and unwanted pregnancies represents

sterilized; these averages were similar to the average of blacks. Whites had 2.7 children on average when they were sterilized. In both Great Falls and on the reservation, even when we control for age, women who were sterilized had a higher average number of children ever born than those who were not sterilized (Table 10). In Great Falls the difference was more than one child on average, whereas on the reservation by age 3549, the difference was only 0.3 children. Apparently, those women who were sterilized were self-selected because of their early and fairly rapid childbearing. These women tended to have reached their desired family size at an early age and then decided sterilization was their best means of controlling fertility.
TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL USE DURING
PREGNANCY
Statistics on whether the women consumed alcohol or smoked cigarettes during their last pregnancy are presented in Table 11. These behaviors have the potential to affect the health of American Indian mothers and their babies. Females in Great Falls were much more likely than those on the reservation to smoke or drink during pregnancy. Nearly 60 per cent in Great Falls smoked cigarettes during their last pregnancy and 36 per cent consumed alcohol. In contrast, on the reservation, onethird smoked cigarettes during their last pregnancy and 14 per cent consumed alcohol. The per cent of whites and blacks who smoked during their last pregnancy (28 per cent for each) was similar to that of American Indians on the reservation (33 per cent), but was much lower than that of American Indians in Great Falls (59 per cent). Whites were much more likely to drink during pregnancy than were any of the other groups, whereas

drinking among blacks was similar to that of American Indians in Great Falls. American Indians on the reservation were the least likely to have consumed alcohol during their last pregnancy. Cigarette smoking was high both in Great Falls and on the reservation for all the education categories, but for both groups alcohol consumption declined as education increased.
DISCUSSION
Only limited fertility and general reproductive health data exist on American Indians. Most fertility estimates are limited to U.S. census data, and data on reproductive health factors such as contraceptive use and breastfeeding are almost nonexistent. To partially fill this void, the Indian Health Service responded to requests from two American Indian health agencies in Montana (Blackfeet Tribal Health Department and Native American Center, Great Falls) to collect behavioral risk and reproductive health data for male and female American Indians, using a household-based, face-to-face survey design. The 1987 Montana American Indian Health Risk Assessment proved successful in terms of collecting the needed behavioral risk and reproductive health data. From the reproductive health data, two important questions can be answered:
1. Does fertility differ for on- and offreservation American Indians, and how does American Indian fertility compare with that of whites and blacks in the United States?
2. How does the influence of the direct determinants of fertility (nuptiality, contraceptive use, lactation, and abortion) compare among American Indians, whites, and blacks?

group. For Great Falls American Indians,
the direct determinants of fertility are consistent with relatively high fertility. Contraceptive use among married women was relatively low. Average age at first marriage was quite young (SMAM = 20 years). Maybe even more importantly, sexual activity tended to begin younger than it does in the general U.S. population. In addition, breastfeeding incidence was low. Not only do these factors lead to high fertility, they also create a high level of unintended pregnancy. Sixty-four per cent of the pregnancies were unplanned, and 20per cent of the pregnancies were unwanted; these proportions are almost twice as high as those in the total U.S. population.
The relatively high fertility of blacks was due largely to low contraceptive use (60 per cent) and low incidence of breastfeeding. Blacks tended to marry late (SMAM = 26 years), but over three-fourths of blacks aged 15-24 years had had sexual intercourse. Therefore, the risk of having an unplanned pregnancy was very high for blacks; this risk is supported by the fact that 61 per cent of their last pregnancies were unplanned.
In contrast to the other three groups, whites were doing many things that contribute to low fertility. Whites tended to marry reasonably late (SMAM = 23 years), had high contraceptive use (69 per cent) and had high use of female and male sterilization, and were more likely to breastfeed than were any of the other groups. Also, whites who used sterilization had much lower fertility than did the sterilized women in the three other groups.

How does the influence of the direct determinants of fertility compare among the two America Indian groups and the whites and blacks? Several similarities exist between the Great Falls American Indians and the black population of the United States. These two groups appear very much alike regarding age at first sexual intercourse (very young), breastfeeding (low prevalence and short duration), planning status of pregnancies (high unplanned), and contraceptive use (only moderate use). This may be a reflection of how urbanization affects poor minority groups in the U.S. Also, the many diverse tribes represented in Great Falls may make adherence to cultural norms much more difficult in urban areas than on reservations. The Blackfeet results, however, do not conform closely to either U.S. blacks or whites or to the urban Indians examined. These findings raise numerous questions concerning the social and economic factors that account for these group similarities and differences. Further studies with much larger data sets are needed to address these issues adequately.
The 1987 Montana American Indian Health Risk Assessment provides important information on the health and demographic characteristics of a select group of Plains American Indians, a very important ethnic group in the United States for which many of these data have been lacking. This study also demonstrates that a household surveyof American Indians, both on- and offreservation, is possible. Future surveys are planned by the Indian Health Service to obtain similar behavioral risk and reproductive health data among other American Indian populations.
