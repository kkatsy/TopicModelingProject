ABSTRACT:As early as 1973 Fletcher documented moral problems families encountered as they struggled with the decision of whether or not to have amniocentesis. In this study we asked 202 women accepting and 50 women rejecting amniocentesis extensive questions about religious beliefs, behaviors, and beliefs about abortion. Members of small Protestant denominations were the most conservative. Catholics and other Protestants were intermediate with smaller differences between these middle groups. Those respondents claiming no religion or one of a nonChristian denomination were the most liberal. Net predictors of acceptance of amniocentesis included respondents' support for laws permitting abortion for medical reasons, negative responses about belief in the sanctity of life, having insurance, and the respondents' political affiliation. Education and religious attendance were the most consistent net predictorsof moral attitudes. We concluded that the amniocentesis decision is influenced by many religious beliefs but is not completely determined by these.

omy to make reproductive decisions (Fletcher, 1981), and when there was a lowering of risks associated with having amniocentesis (Verp and Gerbie, 1981;) Williamson et al., 1984). However, in presenting this decision-making process as a strict dichotomy, Sell et al. (1978) oversimplified the issues involved in prenatal diagnosis. Further, they ignored other influences that may be equally important.
Most of the early studies of attitudes toward amniocentesis were based on small samples of families who had had a child with a trisomy disorder (Black, 1979) or another chronic genetic illness (Leonard et al., 1972; Lubs, 1979) and sought to determine reproductive attitudes and behaviors in such couples. Study groups also included individuals at risk of having a child with a genetic disease which could not be prenatally diagnosed using amniocentesis. These studies revealed a mixed reaction to the availability of amniocentesis. In a study of parents with children with chronic genetic diseases, Leonard et al. (1972) found that reproductive attitudes were determined by the parents' perception of the burden of care for their child. Although these parents showed some preference for selective abortion as a means of preventing the birth of an affected child their first preference was for voluntary sterilization. In Lubs' (1979) study of parents of children with hemophilia and muscular dystrophy, only the parents in the intermediate risk categories had "moral" objections to prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion.
A study by Black (1979) found that parents of mentally retarded children either due to Down's syndrome or of unknown etiology had similar reproductive attitudes. Although half of the

parents were against abortion in general, the majority said they would accept amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis. One family in this latter category would not abort if the fetus were found to be defective. Two families said they would not have further children if amniocentesis were not available, while another two families said they would refuse amniocentesis altogether. Black noted that all families could justify their decisions either to have more children or to accept or reject amniocentesis. However, these justifications could only be described as reflecting motivations and not clear cut (rational) decisions.
In studies specifically related to groups having amniocentesis, Davies and Doran (1982), Robinson et al. (1975), and Finley et al. (1977) stated that all women having amniocentesis were seriously concerned with the probability that they would decide whether or not to abort the affected fetus. Others, Lippman-Hand and Piper (1981), Dixson et al., (1981), Verp and Gerbie (1981), and Antley (1976), listed a multitude of factors influencing whether women would have amniocentesis or not. These included respondents' perception of the burden of raising an affected child, the costs of the amniocentesis procedure, as well as religious beliefs. However, there was no estimation of the differential strengths of these factors in influencing the subjects' decision about amniocentesis.
More recently, studies have described the amniocentesis decision as a balancing of ideological and practical considerations against the commitment to the fetus (Rothman, 1985; Burke and Kolker, 1984). Along these lines, respondents who see their decision to have prenatal diagnosis as synonymous

with the decision to abort an affected fetus have more difficulty in accepting amniocentesis and in justifying their decisions (see also Robinson et al., 1975). However, generalizing from this research is made difficult due to small sample sizes, unrepresentative sampling, and a reliance on bivariate analyses. These studies do not explain how some factors are weighed against others and do not specify the decision-making process itself. Moreover, they fail to clarify the aspects of moral and religious attitudes and behaviors that influence the decision about accepting amniocentesis or not.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE DATA SAMPLE
Two hundred and two women were recruited from all women coming to the University of Iowa for amniocentesis between July, 1981, and June, 1983. This represents approximately onethird of the women having amniocentesis at Iowa City during the period of study. The 50 women refusing amniocentesis were recruited statewide. The sampling techniques and the representativeness of the study samples have been described previously in detail (Ekwo et al., 1985).
Women accepting amniocentesis were generally interviewed in a private room reserved for the study to allow for confidentiality. The interview was conducted by one of us (BS), prior to their amniocentesis procedure. The women rejecting amniocentesis were interviewed at an appropriate place and time of the respondents choosing to allow for privacy and confidentiality. The interviews were scheduled after the women

had decided to refuse amniocentesis to avoid interfering with their decision. This worked out to be between the 18th and 22nd weeks of gestation. Very few women in either group refused to participate in this study.
The questionnaire was structured and sought information on complete demographic, reproductive, and genetic history, attitudes toward birth control, abortion, and family planning. Also included were questions about knowledge of genetic defects, genetic risks, political party affiliation, commitment to career, religious preference, and church attendance.
Respondents verbally answered each question, and all information, both the specific response and any voluntary responses, were recorded by the research assistant. Each respondent was given a card which had the possible response choices, and they were instructed to select the responses which best applied to them. If subjects failed to understand a question, it was reread to them without prompting, rephrasing, or explaining the questions to avoid bias. Each interview session took approximately 1 hour with a range of 35 minutes to 2 hours. Respondents were very cooperative and we had very little missing data. No question was refused by more than four respondents and no systematic nonresponse patterns were found.
ATTITUDE MEASUREMENT
Questions relating to many aspects of religiosity and morality were included in the questionnaire. Specifically, about religious commitments, we asked current and "raised-in" religious preference. Respondents were also asked how strong their commitment to their current religious preference was and how

16

often they attended religious services. Later in the questionnaire respondents were asked how much their religion influenced their ideas about abortion.
Three sets of questions were included and sought information on attitudes and beliefs about birth control, abortion, and family planning. The first set of questions asked respondents if they approved of contraceptives being used under four circumstances: (1) as a means of limiting family size; (2) as a means of spacing the birth of children; (3) as a means of avoiding the birth of children with birth defects; and (4) as a means of avoiding having children all together. Responses were coded on a five-point Likert scale ranging from "strongly disapprove" to "strongly approve." These four questions were repeated substituting abortion for contraceptives. These eight questions were obliquely factor analyzed using varimax rotation and factor selection of Eigen values greater than or equal to 1.5. This method revealed two summary scales differentiating attitudes toward contraceptive use from attitudes toward abortion. These responses were measures of the respondents' own attitudes to abortion and family planning and hence are the most subjective measures of these concepts.
The second set of questions had six items, four of which have been standardized and used extensively in studies of beliefs about abortion (Sell et al., 1978; Arney et al., 1976; Henshaw et al., 1983; Henshaw et al., 1982a; and Grandberg et al., 1980). The women were asked if they felt it should be possible for a pregnant woman to obtain a legal abortion under the following circumstances: (1) if there was a chance of serious defect in the baby; (2) if the woman's health was seriously endan-

gered by the pregnancy; (3) if the woman was married but did not want any more children ; (4) if the family had a low income and could not afford any more children; (5) if the couple did not want to have another child at this time; and (6) if the couple did not want a child of the sex that was diagnosed before birth. Responses were categorized as "yes" or " n o . " The percentage of women agreeing with each question is presented in Table 1 and is compared to responses from previous national surveys.
The table shows that for women accepting amniocentesis, agreement with national parameters was the same for two questions (3 and 4) and higher for two questions (1 and 2). For those refusing the procedure, agreement was equal or lower to that of national parameters on all but Question 2. On this question, about whether the respondent will approve of abortion if a woman's health was endangered by the pregnancy, the percentages of women accepting or rejecting amniocentesis agreeing were much higher than the historical national sample. These differences may be due to the fact that our study sample consisted of currently pregnant older women who were at a relatively higher risk for having a child with birth defects. Unfortunately, neither the age distribution nor the pregnancy status or the national sample was available for comparison. However, older women have been shown to be more likely than younger women to approve abortion when maternal health was endangered (Arney et al., 1976).
These questions were factor analyzed and split into two groups reflecting "hard" and "soft" attitudes toward abortion (Grandberg, 1980; Smetana,

the first trimester, in the first and second trimester, and at any time during pregnancy. Women who said they did not know the law were encouraged to guess. Initially, these questions were coded as a correct versus incorrect response based on the recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions and current State of Iowa laws. However, this measure poorly correlated with other variables and did not seem to be particularly meaningful. We then subjected these responses to factor analysis preserving the original coding with the claim that this better reflected the women's understanding of abortion laws. These questions factored into two categories again representing medical (Questions 2,4,5) and personal-social (Questions 1 and 3) reasons for the abortion. Therefore, in all subsequent analysis the two scales reflecting the women's view of whether the law permitted abortion for medical or personal reasons were used for analysis. These concepts reflect the women's views of what they thought the laws about abortion actually permitted and hence was the most objective measure of their views.
Two other measures of more general attitudes were included in the survey. These two questions have been used in standarized surveys by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC). The first question asks, "How strongly do you agree with the statement 'Life should be preserved under all circumstances all the time?' " This is coded on a five-point Likert scale from "strongly disagree to strongly agree." This measure has been shown to correlate well with other measures of morality and yet it remains independent from specific types of morality. We use it here as a measure of general morality. The sec-

ond questions asks, "Do you think birth control information should be available to anyone who wants it?" and is coded as "yes" or "no." Again, this question has been shown to be one of the best independent predictors of family planning behaviors but is not subsumed under specific types of attitudes towards family planning. These questions were analyzed individually.
Finally, we sought measures of liberalism/conservatism that were not directly linked to attitudes toward abortion, family planning, or general morality. This was measured in two ways. First, we asked political party affiliation and coded it Republican = 3, Independent=2, and Democrat = l. We anticipated that Republicans would be more conservative (e.g., oppose abortion) than Independents or Democrats. Another measure used was support for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). Support was coded as 1and Opposition as 0. Acceptors of amniocentesis were coded as 1 and rejectors were coded as 0. A positive relationship, then, can be interpreted as more applicable to acceptors, a negative relationship to rejectors.
RESULTS
BACKGROUND VARIABLES
There were no differences between women who accepted or rejected amniocentesis in whether or not they had a previous child with Down's syndrome or neural tube defects. Similarly, there were no differences in the ages of women in the two groups, their history of elective abortion, or the ages at which elective abortions had been performed. About 9 per cent of each group had had an elective abortion. Both women ac-

analysis, we collapsed Groups 1 and 2 (disapprove) and Groups 3, 4, and 5 (approve) and refer to this variable as religious approval of legalized abortion.
Both women accepting and rejecting amniocentesis had an average church attendance of about once a month. However, in both groups about half of the sample were regular attenders (once a week) and the other half were low attenders (once or twice a year or less). About 40 per cent of each group had changed their religious preference to one that was different from the church in which they were raised. This is about twice as high as expected (Mueller, 1980). Of those who changed religious groups, half changed to no preference, a fourth to Catholic, and the remaining fourth to Protestant. All of the original Catholics changed to no preference. Protestants changed to Catholic (25 per cent), to other Protestant groups (25 per cent), or to no preference (50 per cent). Protestants who changed to another Protestant denomination generally moved from a denomination opposing legalized abortion to one approving. Therefore, for both original Catholics and Protestants a change in religious group indicated a move to a more liberal philosophy concerning abortion.
There were no differences between women accepting or rejecting amniocentesis on how strongly they were committed to their religion (r= -0.098, p = 0.140). However, there was a slight tendency for those belonging to religious groups that opposed abortion to have a stronger commitment (r= -- 0.127, p=0.056). This relationship is slightly stronger when the non-Christian group is excluded from the calculation. The non-Christians, mostly belonging to Middle and Far-Eastern religions, were

highly committed to their religions. Along these same lines, more of the women refusing amniocentesis stated that their religious teachings on abortion had influenced their feelings about abortion (r=-0.248, p = 0.000). All five measures of religiosity correlated highly with each other.
MORALITY AND ATTITUDES TOWARD
FAMILY PLANNING
The respondents' beliefs in the sanctity of life highly correlated with the decision to reject amniocentesis (r=-- 0.328, p =0.000). This bivariate correlation was the strongest among the attitudinal variables. The respondents view that birth control should be generally available was not significantly correlated with whether they accepted or rejected amniocentesis (r = 0.012, p =0.844). Another general measure, whether or not the respondent approved of the Equal Rights Amendment, was weakly related to accepting amniocentesis (r = 0.143, p = 0.063). These variables were not significantly correlated with each other.
All the scales measuring attitude to family planning were significantly correlated to acceptance of amniocentesis. The respondents' attitudes towards contraceptives (r=0.257, p =0.000) and attitudes towards abortion (r = 0.264, p = 0.000) were moderate predictors. The scale measuring whether or not the woman sanctioned abortion for medical reasons was a moderate predictor (r=0.260,p = 0.000), but the scale measuring sanctioning of abortion for personal-social reasons was only a weak predictor ( = 0.152, p = 0.030).
The last scales, those reflecting the respondents' views on laws permitting abortion, were similar to the scales mea-

was the respondents' views of lawspermitting abortion for medical andfor personal reasons.
We further studied factors predicting the respondents' views of laws permitting abortion for medical reasons (Table 3) and for personal-social reasons (Table 4). The predictors of the respondents' views about laws permitting abortion for medical reasons were their educational level and the frequency of their religious attendance. Whether or not the respondent currently belonged

to a religious group which supports legal abortion did not significantly relate to her views about laws permitting abortion for medical reasons.
Similarly, the only significant predictor of the respondent's view of lawspermitting abortion for personal-social reasons was the woman's education. The more educated thewoman themoreliberal she thought these laws were. There was a slight trend for individuals who attended church frequently or belonged to the Republican Party to regard these

laws as prohibitory, but these relationships were not significant (Table 4). Women who attended church regularly were less educated, had no previous history of abortion, had no insurance coverage, and were more likely to believe strongly in the sanctity of life (Table 5).
To summarize these results in a more concise and meaningful manner, we

have presented a reduced regression model. Here, only significant predictors are included in the analysis. Causal ordering is assumed; hence, background factors are placed as exogeneous variables, attitudes are intermediate endogeneous predictors, and the decision to accept or reject amniocentesis is the main dependent variable (Figure 1).

of the assumed casual equality of the intermediate attitudinal variables, no attempt has been made to present a full path diagram. Instead, the information presented here is for heuristic purposes. Note that in the reduced model the respondents' view of laws permitting abortion for personal-social reasons has been excluded. This is not surprising as this scale was the weakest net predictor in the original full model. The R1 for this model is moderate (R2 =0.292).
In this model, belief in the sanctity of life is the strongest net predictor of the acceptance of amniocentesis. Insurance coverage is about comparable in strength. The other attitude variable, view of abortion for medical reasons, is about equal to the influence of political persuasion. And the last net significant predictor is the respondent's change of religious denomination.
DISCUSSION
Prenatal diagnosis of genetic disease is widely practiced is most developed countries. Amniocentesis is a procedure used prenatally to obtain amnioticfluid,

fetal blood, or fetal cell samples for studies of the well-being and functions of the fetus. Though the procedure has been available to medical practitioners, its full impact on reproductive behaviors and decisions has not been well documented. For instance, although the legal availability of abortion itself is reported to decrease the incidence of the birth of the infants with Down's syndrome in the community (Smith et al., 1980), how much of the reduction is directly attributable to the use of amniocentesis is still unclear. This is because a small percentage of women at risk for Down's syndrome have the procedure (LippmanHand and Piper, 1981; Polani et al., 1979). Further, even if all older women were screened, Cruikshank et al., (1983) have estimated that this would at most reduce the percentage of Down's syndrome births by 5-10 per cent.
The impact of amniocentesis on women who have the procedure is even less clear. Amniocentesis is still closely linked with abortion (Verp and Gerbie, 1981; Davies and Doran, 1982) despite the fact that only a relatively small number of women having the procedure

measured by only one variable. In this paper we attempted to resolve this ambiguity by using five measures of religiosity, seven measures of attitudes toward abortion and family planning, two measures of conservatism, and one measure of general morality.
We found consistent background differences between those accepting and rejecting amniocentesis and this persisted in multivariate analysis. Previous studies of amniocentesis have also documented this socioeconomic difference (Robinson et al., 1975; Davies and Doran, 1982; Antley, 1976). Hence, insurance coverage was the strongest bivariate predictor of acceptance of amniocentesis. Indeed, when the cost of amniocentesis is high, it is an important matter. However, in the open-ended question querying why the women accepted or rejected amniocentesis, only two women openly acknowledged economic reasons as important to their decision. And, while economic limitations are noteworthy, they do not completely determine this decision. Insurance coverage is only one of five significant net predictors, and it is second in strength. Also, insurance coverage represents more than just one issue. Its high interrelatedness with other indicators of socioeconomic differences (income, education, etc.) makes it representative of more general socioeconomic differences between the two groups of women. It may be asked, however, why insurance coverage was the best indicator of socioeconomic status when education and income, respectively, have held this position. Our question did not just ask whether or not the respondent had insurance,but whether they had insurance that would cover the amniocentesis pro-

cedure. This more sensitive measure accounts for its prominence as a net predictor of acceptance or rejection of amniocentesis.
A more surprising background predictor of amniocentesis is that of political party affiliation. In studies of attitudes toward abortion (Henshaw and Martire, 1982a; Grandberg and Grandberg, 1980), Democrats generally have been found to have more permissive attitudes toward abortion than do Republicans. Not surprisingly, Democrats are slightly overrepresented among women who have abortions (Henshaw and Martire, 1982¿>). Here, little can be said to explain the preponderance of affiliation with Republicans as a significant predictor of acceptance of amniocentesis. Socioeconomic differences between party groups is not helpful as an explanation because this relationship holds independent of any measure of socioeconomics. Also, controlling for the women who labelled themselves politically as Independents in our sample did not alter this finding. The other measure of conservatism, the support of the ERA, was not a predictor of any of the dependent variables, afindingconsistent with a previous report by Grandberg and Grandberg (1980).
The only measure of religiosity that was a net direct predictor of the amniocentesis decision was a change of religious group. On a bivariate level, a change of religious group was not significantly related to acceptance of amniocentesis (r=-0.084, p = 0.16). The zero-order correlations of change of religious group with other measures of religiosity are consistent with the interpretation that such a change signals a more liberal attitude toward abortion (less re-
