Japan has developed rapidly within the last hundred years and is now the third largest industrial power in the world. During this development process, in which urbanization increased as rapidly as industrialization, the demographic processes changed drastically. The changes in mortality and natality related to urbanization and industrialization, and associated population increase, are of practical and theoretical interest. The increase in population and changes in population structure and composition are of obvious interest. Group differentials in mortality and natality, and thus population increase, are also important. These differentials by industrial, urban, and occupational status clarify the demographic states of population segments. Examining differentials by industrial and urban status over time illuminate trends of change. The differences found also have many policy and planning ramifications.
Japan furnishes an excellent model to study these changes and differentials. It is developed, is public-health conscious, and has good data. The historical situation in Japan can be compared to historical changes in the Western countries and can also be compared to changes occurring in now developing countries. Such comparisons would increase our understanding of the demo-

graphic transitions and permit clarification of ongoing demographic events.
Mexico is another country in which these changes can be examined. It is a developing country with rapidly changing demographic characteristics. It is public-health conscious and has good data for this period of rapid change. It furnishes another model in which changes in differentials can be examined. Comparisons between the two countries should also prove useful in clarifying the various changes occurring with development.
In presently developed Western countries, with their history of industrialization and urbanization as the death rate declined, the urban-rural, the industrial-nonindustrial and occupational differentials in mortality declined (Darick, 1951; Hansluwka, 1963; Logan, 1954; Lorimer, 1946; Quint, 1959; Rogers, Yamamoto, and Messinger, 1966; Spengler and Duncan, 1963; Szabady, 1964; Thomas, 1941). This trend in mortality has also been observed in the recently developed countries (Carleton, 1965; Dorn, 1964; Miro, 1966; Smith, 1960; Szabady, 1964) and is thought to have occurred in the developing countries. In a similar manner, as the birth rate declined in the nowdeveloped countries, the various differentials in natality declined (Notestein and Sal-

lume, 1957; Penrose, 1934; Westoff, 19S4).1 It is known that the death rate generally declined before the birth rate, and the declines within the urban, industrial and/or occupational strata generally occurred first in the higher strata for both rates.
The demographic transition in the developed countries generally proceeded from a period of relatively high mortality and fertility to one of decreasing mortality with relatively high fertility to one of relatively low mortality with decreasing fertility to the final (present) stage of low mortalityfertility (Dorn, 1964; Hansluwka, 1963; Spengler and Duncan 1963). There were, of course, countries in which the transition took a different form (Spengler and Duncan, 1963).
As stated, these changes during the transition were status dependent. This is true regardless of whether status is defined in terms of urban-rural, industrial-nonindustrial, occupational, or socioeconomic differences. These dimensions are highly correlated. Studies utilizing different dimensions, separately or jointly, have found similar results (Darick, 1951; Guralnick, 1964; Hansluwka, 1963; Leblanc, 1931; Logan, 1954; Lorimer, 1946; Menoguchi, 1954; Moriyama and Guralnick, 1956; Notestein, 1966; Quint, 1959; Rogers, Yamamoto, and Messinger, 1966; Szabady, 1964; Thomas, 1941; Westoff, 1954). Industrialization and urbanization were highly correlated in the developed countries and are highly correlated in the developing countries; and in both cases, occupational group classifications of subpopulations conform
1 Westoff (1954) has demonstrated this clearly in the United States. He examined the rate of the number of children ever born per 1,000 females ages 15-44 (married with husband present), 1910-52, standardized for age, by occupationalsocial class. In 1910, the ratio of lowest class rate to highest class rate was 1.722; it was reduced to 1.454 in 1952. In 1910, the ratio of farmers' rate to highest class rate was 2.055; it was reduced to 1.636 in 1952. Thus, the reduced differential is clear in the United States.

to industrial-urban classifications (Lorimer, 1946; Menoguchi, 1954; Mexico,Dirección General de Estadística, 1954; Moriyama and Guralnick, 1956); Taueber, 1958; Thomas, 1941; Westoff 1954). Urbanization and industrialization are related phenomena in time and place. Differential effects on mortality and natality are related to living conditions, medical attention, literacy, etc., and these in turn are and have been directly related to the industrial-urban status of populations (Coale and Hoover, 1958; LeBlanc, 1931; Lorimer, 1946; Penrose, 1934; Roemer, 1964; Taueber, 1958). These factors are only some of the major determinants of population change. There are many others (Coale and Hoover, 1958; Dorn, 1964; Horwitz and Burke, 1966; Lorimer, 1946; Menoguchi, 1954; Notestein, 1966; Penrose, 1934; Somoza, 1969; Spengler and Duncan, 1963; Taueber, 1964; Thomas, 1941). This paper only examines changes and differentials related to industrialization and urbanization.
Migration is one of the phenomena producing changes in population size and structure. International and internal migration had large influences in the developed countries in the past and in the developing countries through the present. Internal urban to rural migration has been a constant factor in urbanization and industrialization. Such migration influences between groups. In turn, the new settings and the urbanization-industrialization process influences demographic behavior (Hatt, 1957; Häuser and Schnore, 1965; Spengler and Duncan, 1963). The study of migration influences is highlighted elsewhere (Davie, 1949; Dorn, 1964; Durand and Pelaez, 1965; Elizaga, 1965; Morse, 1964; Neiva, 1965; Rycroft and Clemmer, 19636; Spengler and Duncan, 1963; Taueber, 1964), and these influences have been considered for Japan and Mexico in some of the original data sources (Amaga, 1967a, 19676, 1968,

The most-quoted demonstration of changes in status differentials over the demographic transition is the EnglandWales experience. As shown in Figure 1,

less regular in males and in married females. Among married females before 1950, the rates were higher in V than in I ; therefore, the difference in males may be of social (industrial-urban) differences rather than of purely occupational differences. Though not shown, the differentials in fertility similarly declined though later in time (Logan, 1954) (see footnote 1).
Has this happened in more recently developed countries, like Japan (or an East

as the death rate declined in the period 1910-1953, the occupational-social status differentials in mortality also declined (Logan, 1953). Prior to 1950, there was an uninterrupted upward gradient from I to V in mortality. In 1950, the difference was

The declines in the death rate in the now developed countries are credited primarily to advances in medical technology and their

availability, improvements in standards of living, and general increases in wealth (Coale and Hoover, 1958; Horwitz and Burke, 1966; Spengler and Duncan, 1963). In the presently undeveloped countries, the application of already-advanced medical technology has been the primary source of decline (Horwitz and Burke, 1966). The decline in the birth rate in the now developed countries has been attributed to changes in the economic value of children, change in family patterns, the decline in death rate (specifically, the infant and early childhood mortality), advances in contraceptive devices, and both improved knowledge of contraceptives and access to them (Dorn, 1964; Spengler and Duncan, 1963).
It has been shown that the trends in the bith rate in some developing or just developed countries are undoubtedly related to the trend in the death rate (Amaga, 1967a). Both this overall relationship in the trends of mortality and natality and the ramifications inherent in these trends in the socioeconomic differentials of both mortality and natality need to be explored. Since the birth and death processes in a population are of major significance in regard to the structure of the population and changes in that population, a better delineated relationship between the two processes yields vital information about population change, structure, and associated factors. If such a relationship can be shown, and if the assumption that mortality levels affect natality levels is accepted, then further hypotheses are posed and relationships are sought.
Japan furnishes appropriate data for the investigation of this problem. Mexico, a developing nation, also has experienced significant decrements in death rates in recent decades. It, too, has sufficient and satisfactory data to be used as a comparison. The years 192O-19SO will be studied for Japan and 1900-1960 for Mexico.

Japan has developed rapidly in the last hundred years, since the Meiji Restoration (1868). Its social and economic development have been phenomenal, with rapid increases in per capita income, per capita net national product, industrial activity, education, health care and social benefits (Allen, 19S0; Ishii, 1937; Lockwood, 1954; Menoguchi, 19S4; Taueber, 1958; Trewartha, 1965). Prior to the restoration, it was similar in demographic characteristics to thirteenth-century France or Great Britain (Trewartha, 1965). Its population was only 27.2 million in 1852, almost all rural or small town. The population was up to 100 million in the 196O's. By 1868, Japan had several localities with one hundred thousand or more population. Economic development paralleled population growth during 1872-1940 (about 1.5% per year) (Trewartha, 1965). Japan has had a continuous decrease in its agricultural population (from 75% of gainfully occupied in agriculture/forestry in 1872 down to 3 1 % in 1960), a continuous increase in the proportion in industry, and a continuous increase in the proportion urban (in 10,000+ settlements: 12.9% in 1888 to 89.6% in 1960).
Mexico has been developing since the end of its revolution (1921). Industrial activity continues to increase, as does per capita net national product. Per capita income has been increasing. The illiteracy rate has decreased to 38% in the 10 and over ages (1960). Mexico's population grew during 1921-1960 from 12.6 million to 34.9 million, and its population is presently one of the fastest growing in the world. The proportion of the gainfully occupied in agriculture/forestry has remained fairly constant at about 57%. I t has been urbanizing rapidly since 1900. By 1960, the proportion urban had risen from 17.6% to 41.9% in 5000+ areas; 12.3% to 37.2% in 10,000+ areas; 3.3

to 23.9% in 100,000-f- areas; and from zero to 13.3% in areas of a million or more. Mexico has been undergoing rapid socioeconomic and demographic change (Arriaga, 19676, 1970; Collver, 196S; Carleton, 1965; De la Pena, 1954; Miro, 1966; Moreno, 1958; Ochoa, 1955; Rycroft and Clemmer, 1963a,¿>; Somoza, 1969).
The fact that Japan and Mexico have different cultures, both of which differ from Western cultures, would increase the strength of initial generalizations if indeed similar vital trends can be found for these countries.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
It is believed that the grouping of prefecture/states by urbanization and industrial type represents a relatively crude stratification model. Socioeconomic groups cannot be directly represented by such strata.
Both countries have had good census and vital statistics for at least 45 years. In Japan, trustworthy data on death rates are lacking for the period prior to 1920 (Trewartha, 1965), and the Bureau of Statistics has stated in its official reports that infant deaths were so incompletely recorded as late as 1913 as to be valueless for historical study (Logan, 1954). The first census in Japan was in 1920. Mexico has good documentation since 1895, when its first census was taken (except for the period of revolution, 1911-21). Birth registration was only 70-75% complete until 1929. Death registration was almost complete in the period 1895-1910 and gradually improved from about 90% in 1921 to almost complete in 1940, when birth and death registrations were equal in relative completeness (Collver, 1965).
Collver (1965) demonstrated the inaccuracies of the Mexican birth statistics. He specifically showed the suspect nature of

the 1910-21 (revolutionary period) information. There were problems with the censuses and registrations between 1895 and 1930 which had to be balanced to obtain more accurate vital statistics. His primary method was to minimally correct the census information and to modify the births and deaths to fit the population sizes and distributions.2 Collver's estimated birth rates have been utilized in this research. His estimates of completeness of registration (with modifications from Arriaga's work) (Arriaga, 1967a, 1970) were utilized to correct the Industrial-Urban status statistics for 1921 and 1930 (1940-f- birth statistics were shown to be relatively complete and were not further corrected; his estimates differed little from official statistics for 1940-f).
Arriaga (19676, 1970) performed a unique analysis of death statistics for Latin American countries, including Mexico. His derived life tables (1968) are a relatively accurate series for Latin America. Arriaga (19676) derived and presented the differences in death registration between urban and rural areas in Mexico. He showed that low rural registration is a function of the density of registration places and the density of roads in areas. Rural death rates upon correction were greater than urban death rates through 1961 in Mexico, and were much more variable between areas.
Utilizing Arriaga's corrections for registration and Collver's birth rates, Arriaga computed corrected rates for 1921 and thereafter, which he utilized in constructing his life tables. His correction factors3 and resulting corrected rates (Arriaga, 1968, 1970) have been utilized in this research. Arriaga provided rates of natural increase for 1895-1910, death rates for 1921-j-, and
2 An alternate method used by Collver (196S) also produced similar birth rates.
3 Multipliers were used to account for estimated differential under-registration.

under-registration percentages for 1921+ (including urban-rural differences).
In computing new life tables (from whence revised populations and rates came), Arriaga attempted to account for migration. Mexico had major migrations in the period considered, both to and from the United States and to the urban communities. There are few statistics on migration prior to 1942. Arriaga has stated: "It is very difficult to determine the extent to which international migration has affected the Mexican population. Statistics on migration are not reliable" (Arriaga, 1968, p. 184). Nevertheless, he derived estimates for use in the life tables for the large out-movement during 1920-30, the large in-movement during 1930-40, and some out-movement during 1940-60. These movements affected the younger age groups specifically, and thus affected vital statistics. Changes due to migration were thus accounted for. In Japan, international migration (in or out) was examined by Taueber (1958), but was not used to adjust vital statistics. Emigration in Mexico had little effect on rates, but immigration could lower the rates slightly. Rural to urban migration predominantly raises the urban rates, at least temporarily until the new migrants adjusted their rates to those of the urban residents. A similar statement of effect could be made for Japanese migration although it was noticeably less. The effect of migration, therefore, on the vital rates utilized in this study (even though accounted for somewhat) is a slight increase in urban rates and thus a very slight understatement of industrial-urban group differences. This is true especially in Mexico, where the differences are more urban-rural differences than industrialnonindustrial differences. Even in Mexico, however, there is a separate industrial component which plays a role in the differentials. In Japan, the industrial-nonindustrial dimension is just as important as the urban-

rural dimension in the stratification, especially after 1920.
Because of the obvious errors in all statistics prior to 1921 (Arriaga, 19676, 1970; Collver, 196S), I-U strata rates were not computed prior to 1921. The 1921 statistics, though used, must be interpreted with caution. Statistics used herein for Japan and Mexico are drawn from the vital statistics sources for those countries (Instituto Mexicano de Recursos Naturales Renovables, 1960; Japan, Prime Minister's Office Bureau of Statistics, 1915, 1952; Mexico Dirección General de Estadística, 1897, 1902, 1924, 1939, 1941a, 19416, 1943, 1947,1950,1952,1953,1954,1962; United Nations, 1954, 1963a, 1965) unless otherwise noted.
Using the variable "per cent of gainfully occupied in agriculture," Taueber (1958) ordered the prefectures in Japan into industrial types, using the 1930 census. These types are considered here to approximate industrial-urban strata in an ecological manner. These groups are generally homogeneous within themselves and heterogeneous amongst themselves on a number of basic measures (such as income). They represent almost perfectly the per cent urban and the per cent in industry. The groups formed thus represent an industrialurban hierarchy. The numerous states of Mexico have been ordered on the same basis, utilizing the same variable, using the 1950 census (Mexico Dirección General de Estadística, 1954). The latter date has been chosen so as to be closest to the 1930 data for Japan; in 1930, Japan's percentage was 57% versus 48% for Mexico in 1950. The relative Industrial-Urban (I-U) status of the prefectures/states within each country over time is fairly constant.4
4 For example, the Spearman Rho correlation for Mexico's states between 1940 and 1950 when ranked on the criteria is 0.961, and no state switches groups. This finding remains fairly constant over the time period considered.

The classification criteria used here for industrial-urban stratification is the percentage of the gainfully occupied population in Agriculture and Forestry (Taueber, 1958), as follows: I (high), under 20%; II, 20-39% III, 40-49%; IV, 50-59%; V (low), 60%-f. The distributions of prefectures/states by classification criteria are shown in Table 1.

order to evaluate the differentials between strata in natality and mortality, certain indices were derived to represent these differentials between groups for each country for each year considered. One such index was the actual difference between the natality or mortality rate of Group I and that of Group V, expressed in absolute terms (|D|). It is used to measure absolute

The relationship of urbanization and industrialization has been examined for Japan and Mexico. In Japan, the relationship is very high (Taueber, 1958). Thus, in 1930, the proportion in agriculture and forestry (in the labor force) is only 27% in urban areas of 5,000 or more (and 73% in rural areas), and the proportion in manufacturing (in the labor force) is directly related to the proportion urban (Taueber, 1958). In Mexico, in 1950, the proportion urban (2,500 or more) has a calculated correlation of --0.87 with the per cent of the labor force in agriculture/ forestry.
COMPUTATIONS
The birth rates and death rates for this analysis were computed for each industrialurban group for each country over the time period considered. High industrial-urban strata prefectures/states represent Group I (high I-U status), low industrial-urban strata represent Group V (low I-U status). Groups I and V were the ones primarily used. Other groups generally fell between these two and are not used separately. In

change. A |D| value of 0 means the rates are equal. The rates used (for a specific country in a specific year) were the crude death rate, the crude birth rate, the infant mortality rate, and the rate of natural increase.
It is the general hypothesis of this paper that the mortality and natality trends can be shown to interact, the former preceding and affecting the latter, but that this interaction is also reflected in the differentials between I-U strata in the ratio and their trends. These differentials will reflect urbanrural differences in the beginning and both urban and industrial effects with time. Thus, from previous knowledge, it is hypothesized that the mortality decline occurs (I). Second, the same decline occurs in the first, starting in the high I-U status group low I-U status group (V), thus reducing the status group differential (absolute difference |D| decreasing). Third, the beginning of the decline in natality is seen in the high I-U status group ( I ) . In the fourth instance, one expects the low I-U status group (V) natality first to increase, because of the positive effects of reduced

mortality on fertility (Arriaga, 1967a). This group will then start their natality decline, thus reducing the status group differential for that rate (decrease in | D | ) . From what is expected, the behavior of the rates can be examined and compared.
The results obtained in this study are applicable to the groups (subpopulations) under study. They do not explain individual behavior, nor do they correspond exactly to the results of any studies where individuals were studied rather than groups. Ecological and individual studies differ in methodology and often in results (Lebowitz, 1962; Rogers, Yamamoto, and Messinger, 1966; Duncan and Davis, 1953).
RESULTS
Trewartha (1965) has indicated, for Japan between 1868-1940, that as industrialization and urbanization increased, birth and death rates decreased. In Japan, both death and birth rates have declined since 1920 for all occupational-social classes (Taueber, 1958). The declines in the death rates occurred first in the higher class (Logan, 1954) ; this group previously had higher rates than those in the lower status group, primarily due to urban residence. The declines in the birth rates proceeded in the same manner, but after the death rate declines (Taueber, 1958). In Mexico, the death rate declines proceeded as in Japan, and the declines became rapid as modern technology made large gains against the very high mortality. However, birth rates first increased with decreasing mortality (Arriaga, 1970). In Mexico, as the per cent of males in the labor force in nonagricultural occupations increased during 1921-60 from 24% to 4 1 % , and as the per cent urban increased in that period, the age-sex standardized birth rate actually increased from 41/1000 to 49/1000. Some decrease is thought to have occurred since 1960.

In both countries, the death rate declined in the high strata as public health practices were introduced, first into the cities where most of these people lived. In the post-war period, there was an increase in the number of diseases which could be controlled without necessitating large changes in the resource situation, levels of income, or ways of living. Differences in mortality in various geographical areas and classes may have then widened somewhat in the process, but the rapid declines in natural mortality and the patterns of decline show a movement of all groups within the nation toward low mortality (Taueber, 1958). In 1964, the crude death rate of Japan was 6.9 per 1000, and in Mexico for the same year it was 9.8 (United Nations, 1965). These and other trends are shown in the data below, and expounded so that further ramifications may be highlighted.
It can be seen from Table 2 that the Japanese infant mortality rate and the Mexican death rate decline over time (as does the Japanese death rate, not illustrated: 18.2/1000 in 1930 to 7.6/1000 in 1960). The birth rate in Japan also decreases with time; but the birth rate in Mexico actually increases until 1950, when it begins to decrease slightly. In Japan, Taueber also showed the high fertility groups decreased more than the lower fertility groups between 1925 and 1947 (Taueber, 1958).5
All differences in the birth and death rates of the high and low I-U strata (|D|) decrease over the periods considered. The differences in Mexico appear not to decline until 1930 and later. The trends, however, show various fluctuations with time.
5 The correlations between the number of female births per 1,000 females in specific age groups by prefecture for 1925 and the decline in this rate between 1925 and 1947 by prefecture were all significant, ranging from 0.24 (ages 15-19) and to 0.97 (ages 15-19 and 45-49).

the low I-U stratum. In Mexico, the death rate changes dramatically (while the birth rate essentially does not change) first in the high I-U stratum and then in the low I-U stratum. Thus, the natural increase rate increases in general and in high and low strata, while the differential decreases.
In Mexico, the rate of natural increase (NIR) is always higher for stratum V (low I-U). The changes in stratum V parallel those of stratum I (high I-U) but come closer in rate with time. The absolute differences between NIR's of strata I and V decrease after 1930 (1930, 1940, 1950). The V/I ratio decreases from 1921 to 1950 (200 to 118). Fluctuations of NIR in time was due to various factors. The increase in NIR between 1920 and 1930 appears to be due to a decrease in death rate in stratum I and a birth rate increase in V. In both strata, the decrease in NIR between 1930 and 1940 appears to be due to a decrease in the birth rate faster than the death rate decrease. Between 1940 and 1950, in both strata, the birth rate increased and the death rate decreased.
In Japan, it was primarily in the high I-U stratum that the decrease of the NIR occurred, which led to the convergence of the group rates. In Mexico, it appears that the high I-U stratum rate, though increasing, increased less than that of the low stratum group.
Finally, an early widening of the difference between strata appears, which then appears to decrease. The widening in Japan is due to the widening of the infant mortality rate differential between strata. In addition, the lag of the birth rate changes following death rate changes, as seen in Table 2, conform to our expectations. In Mexico, it appears related to the larger birth rate differential between strata.

In Japan, mortality decreased rapidly for both groups, the more so for the high status group, which is first highest. The decrease in the birth rate was similar in both groups, although it appeared to be more accelerated in the higher group in the beginning. It is also known that the number of female births per thousand females in specific age groups in perfectures of 1925 correlated highly with the decline in the number between 1925 and 1947 (Taueber, 1958), which means that in this period the higher fertility groups declined faster once decline started. With the knowledge that natality was by then greater for the low status groups, the decrease in the differential is comprehensible and is in accordance with the general trend.
In Mexico, the trend illustrates the sharp decrease in mortality starting in the high stratum, and the accelerating decrease in natality in the high stratum, which then rises slightly. Natality in the low stratum varied in the period while there was a decrease in mortality.
Changes in the age structures of these groups occur with the changes in the interaction of mortality and natality and is now a well-known phenomenon (Coale, 1957; Keyfitz and Murphy, 1964; Valons, 1949). In the extremes, under high natality and low mortality, one expects the highest proportion to be in the 0-14 age group and the lowest proportion to be in the 5 0 + age group. Under medium to low natality and mortality, the reverse is expected. In Japan, the per cent dependent (under 15 and 65+) decreased after 1930 to 38.6% in 1955. In Mexico, the per cent dependent increases after 1920 up to 46.5% in 1960.
The structure of the population then changes in each group as natality and mortality interact along the general trend discussed.

DISCUSSION
The industrial-urban typology, utilizing the proportion employed in agriculture, does differentiate the groups of high industrialization and urbanization from those of low I-U. Over time, these groups remain fairly constant, with little to no shift of a prefecture or state from one stratum to another. In addition, relative urbanization remains similar, with the high I-U strata still highly urban and low I-U strata still highly rural. However, differences found are not due only to the urban proportions within groups, since middle status groups, with some mix of urban characteristics, show the same relationships.
The major differences in levels and trends of mortality and natality between Japan and Mexico are probably due to Japan's advanced "modernization." That is, Japan has industrialized and become urbanized far more rapidly than Mexico. Japan continues to have more people living in large cities. In 1950 the per cent in urban areas of one million or more was 54% in Japan versus 13.3% in Mexico (Browning, unpublished; Trewartha, 196S), and a larger proportion was occupied outside of agriculture (54.7% in Japan versus 42.9% in Mexico).
These differences, and the fact of modernization, also reflect the differences in health facilities and their availability in the two countries. Thus, the proportion of physicians to the total population in 1960 was about 0.05% in Mexico compared to 1.4% in Japan (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1963). The availability of medical treatment to the lower strata has increased greatly in Latin America, but is still very disproportionate to their need, especially in the more rural areas (Roemer, 1964). Although the death rates and the differentials have declined in Mexico, the

expectation of life at birth is still about ten years lower than in Japan; in the period 1955-59, it was 55-59 for Mexico and 65-69 for Japan (United Nations, 1963a).
As of 1960, Mexico lagged behind Japan in most measures. It was about 12 years behind in mortality rates, 35 years behind in urbanization, and 20 years behind in reductions in the proportion in agriculture. The differences between the two countries in fertility and in the dependency ratios were actually increasing still in 1960.
It is interesting to note that Hungary, a country inbetween Japan and Mexico in industrialization and urbanization, shows the same decline in the occupation differential with the decline in mortality (Instituto Mexicano de Recursos Naturales Renovables, 1960) (see Figure 2). It may be concluded that, in general, when a country's mortality rate declines, the IndustrialUrban (and occupational) differentials in mortality likewise decline.
These two countries are going through changes much more rapidly than did the developing countries. Japan's transition is similar, however, to the general model. Mexico's is not, due to the rapid mortality decline and the increase and leveling off in natality. Mortality declines in both countries were much more related to medical technology than the declines experienced in the developed countries. In fact, the decline has occurred in Mexico without major changes in living conditions. Both countries experienced much more rapid urbanization also, with the trend continuing in Mexico. Fertility has yet to decline in Mexico, even with the mortality decline, urbanization, some industrialization, and some improvements in per capita income. It is, therefore, difficult to predict the demographic transition in Mexico, but it appears different than that which occurred in the West.
