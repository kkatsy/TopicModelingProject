ABSTRACT: Distributions of the incidence of anencephaly in Japan were obtained using nationwide data on fetal and postnatal deaths of individuals with anencephaly during 1969-71. Higher incidences of anencephaly occurred in the urbanized and industrialized areas and lower values in the comparatively sparsely populated highlands. Population size and variance of incidence show a negative association. The distribution of the incidence seems to be binomial, and expected incidences based on binomial distribution indicated good agreement with weighted mean incidences in populations with different sizes. The rate of first cousin marriages among the parents of anencephalic patients is 1.86 per cent, a value not significantly different from the value of general population, 2.13 per cent. It seems that the inheritance of anencephaly is not related to a specific number of recessive genes.

Penrose (1957) noted wide geographical variation in the frequencies of malformations of the central nervous system among different countries and regions. Imaizumi (1974) has reported that the incidence of anencephaly is higher in northeast than in southwest rural Japan, but the mean anencephalic incidences in urban and rural areas are very similar.
According to Carter (1969), the etiology of anencephaly is a multifactorial inheritance involving both genetic and environmental factors. Only 7.S per cent of the anencephalic fetuses were liveborn, and all of them died within the first month after birth (Imaizumi, 1974). Therefore, this malformation is a lethal disease. The parents of offspring with anencephaly seem to be normal · individuals in appearance. Almost all studies on the sex ratio in anencephaly report more-females to be affected than niales (Timson,-1970). In Japan, the per cent of anencephalic infants who are

males varies from 47 to 55, and the chisquare value between anencephalic fetal deaths and fetal deaths in the general population (57 per cent) is statistically significant at the 0.1 per cent level (Imaizumi, 1974).
When the size of a population is small, the incidence of a rare disease will tend to take on a value either too low (say, 0) or too high because of the sample size. Therefore, it is important to know the size of population in order to estimate the incidence. The present study deals with the distribution of the incidence of anencephaly for different population sizes and the etiology of this disorder.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
There are two sources of data available for the present analysis. First, data consisting of 2,489 fetal deaths with anencephaly reported during the period 1969 to 1971, inclusive have been obtained from

the fetal death certificate records kept at the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Second, the data consisting of 172 postnatal deaths with anencephaly reported during 1969 to 1971 and taken from the death certificate records kept at the Ministry of Health and Welfare were utilized in this study. Data on the general population were taken from the annual volumes of Vital Statistics of Japan for the years 1969-71 (Japan, Ministry of Health and Welfare, 1971, 1972, 1973).
The total number of cases of anencephaly was divided into 1,211 wards, cities, or gun, according to the place of residence. A gun consists of approximately six towns and/or villages. In computing the incidence of anencephaly, the reported number of deaths ascribed to this malformation was divided by the total number of fetal deaths plus live births corresponding to the same period in the general population.

GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF BIRTHS
Figure 1 shows the total number of anencephalic births in each ward, city, town, and village according to the place of residence. It is obvious that anencephaly is comparatively rare in the sparsely populated highlands. The incidence of anencephaly was computed for each ward, city, or gun. The total number of administrative units was arbitrarily divided into four different population sizes according to the number of fetal deaths plus live births: over 10,000, 5,000-10,000, 2,000-5,000, and less than 2,000. As shown in Table 1, the total numbers of administrative units in these groups are 160, 165, 506, and 380, respectively. The mean population sizes are 19,129, 6,739, 3,081, and 1,310, respectively.

ulation size. The simple mean incidences of the other three groups take on a similar value (0.00040). The chi-square value between the largest population size and the others is statistically significant at the 1 per cent level.
It is also interesting to look at where there is a higher risk of anencephaly in the largest size population group. The 160 administrative units in the largest population groups were subdivided into groups according to which one of the eight districts of Japan they belonged to, and the anencephalic incidence and population density were computed for these eight districts (Table 2). The lowest population density

DISTRIBUTION OP THE INCIDENCE OF ANENCEPHALY
Thirty-four per cent of 1,211 administrative units show zero incidence for anencephaly. Weighted mean incidences are 0.000451, 0.000408, 0.00040S, and 0.000394 in order of large population size, respectively. These values are similar for weighted and simple mean values. On the other hand, the variances of anencephalic incidence are 3 X 10~8, 7 X 10~8, 16 X 10~8, and 42 X 10~8, according to the above order. The mean population size and variance of anencephalic incidence show a negative association. Figure 2 shows the distributions of the incidence of anencephaly

and anencephalic incidence is found in the Hokkaido District. The highest population densities are found in the Kanto and Kinki districts where the incidences also show higher values, 0.000461 and 0.000464, respectively. These two districts are the most urbanized and industrialized areas in Japan, In spite of the low population densities in the Tohoku and Chugoku districts, the anencephalic incidences in these areas show high values, 0.000459 and 0.000499, respectively.

for four different population sizes. From Figure 2, the distribution of incidence seems to be the binomial distribution. The variance (V) of this distribution is p(l-- p)/N, where p and N are the mean incidence of anencephaly and the population size, respectively. The value of p is very small, so that the value of V is approximately p/N. Therefore, the value of p is equal to NV. Table 3 shows the relationship between the incidence of anencephaly and A T (say, expected incidence), where

N is the harmonic mean of the population sizes. As is obvious from this table, both parameters take on similar values.
CONSANGUINITY
Consanguinities of the 323 index patients among 2,661 cases were examined from the koseki, the family registration records in Japan. Therate of first cousin marriages is higher in the instance of female patients (4/166 = 2.41 per cent) than in that of males (2/155 = 1.29 per cent). However, the number of the couples examined is small. The rates of first cousin marriages among all parents of anencephalic patients and among the general population are1.86 per cent (6/323) and 2.13per cent (200/ 9,385), respectively. The chi-square value between the above twovalues is not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
Consanguineous marriages are stillcommon in Japan. According to Imaizumi (1974), the incidence of anencephaly in rural areas in Japan showed a gradient from northeast to southwest. The inbreeding level is lower in the former area than in the latter area (Imaizumi et al., 1975). Therefore, the relationship between the anencephalic and inbreeding levels shows a negative association. On the other hand, there wasno excess in the incidence ofanencephalic patients born to consanguineous marriages (the present paper, and Schull,

1958). On the basis of the above statements, it seems that the inheritance of anencephaly is not related to a specific number of recessive genes, a hypothesis proposed by Timson (1972). Penrose (1957) was against any single major-gene hypothesis and has favored the polygenic hypothesis.
Pleydell (1960) showed that there was a higher incidence of anencephaly in urban than in rural areas of Northamptonshire, England. In the present paper, we have shown that the incidence is higher in urbanized and industrialized areas than in nonurbanized and nonindustrialized areas. Again, looking at this problem from the viewpoint of population density, the Chugoku District is not an overcrowded area. However, there is located in that district an industrial belt associated with thechemical industry.
SUMMARY
Distributions of the incidence of anencephaly were obtained using nationwide data in Japan on fetal andpostnatal deaths of individuals with anencephaly during 1969-71. The largest incidence (0.00045) was obtained in the largest population size (larger than 10,000), and the chi-square value between the largest population size and the others is statistically significant at the 1 per cent level. Higher incidences of anencephaly occurred in the urbanized and industrialized areas and lower values

were found in the comparatively sparsely populated highlands.
The distribution of the incidence seems to be the binomial, and expected incidences based on binomial distribution indicated good agreement with weighted mean incidences in populations with different sizes.
Population size and variance of anencephalic incidence show a negative association.
The rate of first cousin marriages among the parents of anencephalic patients is 1.86

per cent. It seems that the inheritance of
anencephaly is not related to a specific
number of recessive genes.
