ABSTRACT: This paper illustrates the application of conventional regression techniques to the analysis of breastfeeding rates derived from the birth dates of respondents' recent children and their breastfeeding status at date of interview. Rates of this type have been found to be less biased than rates based on recall of the duration of breastfeeding, but require new analytical approaches to be fully exploited.

The durations of breastfeeding that women report for their open and closed birth intervals have been used in several analyses of breastfeeding differentials (Knodel and Debavalya, 1980; Page et al., 1980; Akin et al., 1981; Jain and Bongaarts, 1981), but are recognized as being far from satisfactory. Obvious problems are the heaping of durations at half-yearly intervals and, in closed intervals, the restriction of data to women with two or more live births. In the open interval, the more important difficulty arises that observation times are necessarily proportional to the open interval length, favoring women whose birth intervals are long or who breastfed relatively briefly since these are the women whose breastfeeding experience is most completely reported. Cutoff dates are sometimes imposed to remove "old" information, but this procedure does not necessarily compensate for the bias inherent in the methodology.
Provided that women report the dates of their children's births with reasonable accuracy, it is possible to derive estimates of the duration of breastfeeding of much higher quality from wom-

en's breastfeeding status at the time of interview. It is that approach that the present paper follows.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Limiting our observations to births which occurred exactly y months prior to interview, we construct an estimate of the proportion of women breastfeeding for duration y, \y, by dividing:
Number of women currently breastfeeding a child born y
months before interview
Number of women with births y months before interview
(For durations y < 10 months the denominator will include only most recent births, while at longer durations increasing proportions of penultimate and earlier births enter. It is assumed that none but the most recent child would still be breastfeeding, although this is not always true.) By ordering the proportions still breastfeeding at progressively

longer durations, we produce a complete life table of breastfeeding continuation.
The table may be either birthweighted (by counting each birth that occurs) or woman-weighted (by weighting each of a woman's births by one over the total number of her births that are counted in the table).1 For comparison, open or closed interval data produces woman-weighted rates, while combining open and closed intervals produces rates that are birthweighted, or nearly so.
The rates we have outlined will be called "current status" rates to differentiate them from open and closed interval rates (which may be calculated by the familiar product-limit method (cf. Kaplan and Meier, 1958)). While much less prone to bias than open and closed interval rates, the current status rates have one major drawback in that they are a collection of independent ly estimates for the different durations. At the sample sizes available to us, it is not uncommon for a particular value /, to be higher than an earlier value /,. Either smoothing the rates or selecting wider interval units to increase sample sizes (for example, using quarterly rather than single month intervals) might resolve anomalies of this sort, assuming that they are not the result of seasonal or other period variations in breastfeeding practices. The problem is illustrated in Figure 1,
1Woman-weighted rates might also be generated by randomly selecting one birth from among those occurring to each woman in the interval of observation. This loses information, however, inasmuch as only the open interval can contribute to the numerator in current status rates. Unlike birthweighted rates, woman-weighted rates are also sensitive to the timepoint selected for cutoff owing to their dependence on the number of events that have occurred.

which shows current status breastfeeding rates for the 1974 Sri Lanka Fertility Survey, calculated using time intervals of different widths.2
A comparison between open interval, closed interval, and current status breastfeeding life tables using Sri Lankan data is presented in Figure 2, to indicate the extent of bias to which tables of the former types are open. The figure indicates that both closed and open interval rates are seriously in error at long durations. At durations less than two years the open interval rates are satisfactory, heaping occurring mainly at 24 and 36 months. In closed intervals, however, heaping is also severe at 12 and 18months, biasing almost the whole of the distribution. Restricting the data to relatively recent periods (e.g., open and closed intervals begun in the past five years) only moderately changes the figures.
To date we have not attempted to determine whether open or closed interval data misrepresent breastfeeding differentials in the same way that they may misrepresent overall and mean durations of breastfeeding. Since both the degree of heaping of reported durations and the degree of bias in the heaped interval are likely to vary among women
2In the World Fertility Surveys the dates of births and interview are recorded in centurymonths (months elapsed since December, 1899), making monthly intervals the smallest units of observation. To employ longer intervals, the date of birth and interview would be recoded in the new interval units and then subtracted. A bias results if dates are subtracted first and the regrouping is done on the intervals. Except for the 0 code (birth and interview falling in the same interval), the subtracted durations correspond to exact time points, so that for the interval Date of Interview -- Date of Birth = y, the proportion currently breastfeeding will correspond to ly The 0 interval corresponds to approximately l¼. These relationships are derived in Smith (1980).

with different social and demographic characteristics, the potential for misrepresentation is evidently present.
Recently, Ferry and Anderson have pointed out that women-weighted current-status breastfeeding rates can be calculated from information on the last live birth only, allowing direct comparison between open interval and current status rate estimates. The procedure they adopt is to use numbers currently breastfeeding their last child by child's date of birth to construct the numerators for current status rates. As denominators, for all intervals longer than about one year they use the mean number of births per month in the last ten or so months, for which the birth count is likely to be complete. Details of the methodology are given in Anderson et al. (1984).
Restricting our attention to current status information, four methods of data analysis are available to us. First, we may compare mean breastfeeding durations for selected subgroups of women, the mean being simply the sum of the individual ly rates plus about one-half a month.3 To reduce distortion when sample sizes are small, we may weight the proportion breastfeeding at each duration by the number of observations in the interval before the summation is carried through. The resultingfigureis then divided by the mean sample per interval to yield the mean.4
A more direct estimate of mean breastfeeding duration utilizing current status data, suggested by Mosley et al.
3The estimate is a linear approximation. It can be improved slightly by replacing the value ½ with 1/8 · l1 + 3/8 · proportion initially breastfed. Both figures are for interval widths of one month.
4In what follows, all means will be estimated by this procedure.

(1980), is simply to divide the number of women in a particular subgroup who are breastfeeding, regardless of the age of the child, by the number of births to women in the subgroup over the past one year or half their number of births over the past two years. In tests with WFS data (Ferry and Smith, 1983) these estimates have proven to be of consistently high quality.
The shapes of ly distributions for different subgroups may also be compared, perhaps by a logit regression on a standard breastfeeding schedule or on the whole-sample breastfeeding distribution. The method is outlined in Brass and Coale (1968, pp. 127-132) and Lesthaeghe and Page (1980). The latter reference provides a model breastfeeding schedule.
Greater depth of analysis is possible by use of proportional hazard models relating the proportions breastfeeding at various durations to selected background variables, or by linear regression. Proportional hazard models are introduced in a paper by McDonald (1981). The present paper will explore linear regression models, which should be more familiar to readers.
When using regression models, it is essential that the fitted estimates be made duration-specific, since the probability of lactation is heavily dependent on time elapsed since childbirth. Regressing breastfeeding status separately for each duration is one option (see Figure 3), but the regression coefficients may not be stable if sample sizes are small. An alternative that allows samples for different intervals to be combined in a single regression is to include the îy terms in the regressor list. That is, for each duration we would fit a model of the form

Here, y is the duration of observation on the /'th individual and k¡is the individual's duration of lactation. As before, lyis the proportion of women lactating at duration y over the whole sample.5 The terms in bx represent regressor variables (x) and their coefficients(b). And iijis a stochastic error term with expected mean and variance

Other coefficients and the constant term become estimators of differences between the individual and the mean. Moving the term ly from the righthand side of the regression equation to the left makes this relationship exact. With the change the model becomes:6

(2)
The left-hand side of the model is now the difference between the individual's own breastfeeding status at y and that of sample respondents generally. The term takes values between 1.0 (for an individual who breastfeeds at a time when virtually all other women have stopped) and -- 1.0 (for an individual who has stopped at a time when virtually all other women are still breastfeed-

5In place of the ly terms, the user might also use a series of dummy variables for the separate time
periods. 6For conventional life tables ly is replaced by
the term 1p1 = ly+1/ly, and the individual is sampled in all intervals through time of termination.

timepoint.

ing).7 The estimate Py* is unbiased. For the subsample n of women with like attributes, the mean of the terms Py*(n) is the proportion currently breastfeeding at y in the subsample (which we may designate//«)).
Although the model allows all durations to be incorporated in a single regression, we expect that for most subgroups n and most durations x * y, (Un) - ¡x) * (ly(n) - ly). In particular, at very short intervals, when most women may be breastfeeding, and very long ones, when most are not,^ the different subgroups should display ly(n) values close to ly, while at intermediate durations the groups should become more distinct. Any single model spanning all durations will be defective if this is the case and should ideally be replaced by a series of models fitted to different regions of the ly curve. For example, separate models might be fitted to the part of the ly distribution to the left of the point ly = 2/3, to the region between 2/3 and^/3 and to the region right of the point ly = 1h. The durations at which these values fall will differ from sample to sample. (For Sri Lanka they fall at about 16 and 28 months, respectively, and these numbers have been used to split intervals in the regressions that follow.)
To correct for heteroscedasticity observations at duration y may be weighted in proportion to the inverse of the sample variance cr2/ = ly(l--ly) I Ny, where Ny is the sample size at y.
7We may also replace ly in Expression (2) by ln(y), where the subscript n denotes the breastfeeding rate for a particular subgroup of the sample to which the individual belongs (e.g., the breastfeeding rate for women of the respondent's own age group and educational level). This allows a few variables to be used as controls in the regression.

RESULTS
We have tested models of the type shown in (2) on breastfeeding information for a number of countries participating in the WFS (Smith and Ferry, 1985). Table 1 displays findings for Sri Lanka using birth-weighted rates, where we have selected the variables parity group (Parity 1-2,3-4,5 + ),educational level (none, primary school, middle school or more), residence (rural, urban migrant, lifetime urban resident), work experience since marriage (none, work at home, work away from home), and use of contraception since the birth (none, traditional methods, modern methods). (In earlier regressions age group, sex of child, and whether additional children were wanted following the birth were also tested. These factors were not found significant and have been dropped.) There are conceptual problems with three of thevariables used. In the caseof residence, status as of interview is used. We would rather have known the respondent's status in the period following the birth, which is not always the same. Likewise, work status following the birth is more informative than work experience in general. Finally, a determining factor in contraceptive use is the duration since the birth. Hence, an overall regression coefficient for this variable is less informative than coefficients for different duration periods. There is also an interaction effect between contraceptive use, pregnancy, and lactation, whereby contraception enables women to breastfeed longer if they so choose. (Though it does not follow that they will do so.)
The table resolves two questions relating to contraceptive use. First, con-

traception is not found to influence net breastfeeding rates in the interval (1,16), although it is about as prevalent as in later intervals (36 per cent useis reported in thefirstinterval, 39per cent in the second and 33per cent in the third). Contraception clearly contributes to avoidance of pregnancy in periods beyond about oneand a half years, as both its general influence on breastfeeding and that of modern methods in particular are pronounced at long durations. The positive coefficients at intervals beyond the first also imply that contraceptive useisnot a substitute for lactation in Sri Lanka, or not a predominant one.
Among other variables, lifetime urban residence is associated with short durations of breastfeeding, andbeing an urban migrant is associated with intermediate durations, relative to those of rural women.8 The effects of residence on breastfeeding are especially pronounced in thefirstinterval. It is not obvious why the coefficients for migration cease to be significant at longer durations.
By parity as by contraception, differences in breastfeeding rates are not significant at short durations but become so with time as lower parity women reach pregnancy. Patterns by age are similar, but less sharp (not shown). An association between parity and other factors is evident in the coefficients for Parity 3-4, which are mostly
8Since the birth sample is largely rural (82 per cent), we have regressed breastfeeding rates separately for births to urban women to check that the effects of other factors are similar for the two residential areas. Coefficients for the factors shown in the table were found to differ, as did levels of significance, but the direction of association was the same in every case in the single-period regression and usually the same in the three subperiods.

negative in the single-attribute rates (-- 0.008 overall, and +0.007, -0.007, 0.018 in the three sub-intervals), but positive in the multiple regression. Evidently because of interactions with other variables, signs also change for primary education.
Finally, we note that middle school attendance and work at home are both strongly associated with lactation behavior, the former negatively and the latter to about an equal degree positively. The difference is partly between income groups, those with middle schooling or more tending to have higher family incomes and not to work, and those working at home tending to be less-educated and poor. Working outside the home seems not to influence breastfeeding to any great extent.

The effects of the various factors are displayed in greater detail in Figure 3, which shows regression coefficients separately for each interval, using interval widths of three months to avoid extremely small sample sizes. The sample sizes in the figure vary between 231 and 343 cases per interval; and all categories include more than 10 per cent of the cases except urban migrants (5-10 per cent), lifetime urban residents (6-14 per cent) and users of traditional family planning methods (9 per cent in one interval).
Since each regression is for a single interval, the model of Expression (1) was used. The term in ly which for single intervals influences only the constant term of the regression, was omitted; hence, each regression is a simple diS-

criminant analysis. The correspondence between the figure coefficients and the grouped-interval coefficients of Table 1 will be seen to be close, the instability of the single interval estimates notwithstanding.
By an elementary calculation wecan convert the regression coefficients displayed in Table 1into estimates of group differences in mean durations of breastfeeding, which may be compared with the whole-sample mean, (1= 21.0 months, found by summing the individual lx values as outlined earlier. The regression estimate is found as:

To justify the formula, note that the breastfeeding curve of Figure 1 can be idealized as a series of trapezoids whose areas sum, approximately, to the mean breastfeeding duration. (See Figure 4, where we have superimposed the trapezoid Oadg on the curve of proportions breastfeeding from t = 0 to t = 16 months.9). The regression coefficients

can be interpreted as linear distances between the overall proportion breastfeeding at each duration and the proportions breastfeeding in the different subgroups and in the idealizedfigurebecome lines parallel to the general curve. The areas between these lines, which are the regression coefficients times the interval widths, correspond to the differences between the whole-sample and subgroup means.
The point is illustrated in Figure 4 for rural and urban breastfeeding rates. In the interval (0, 16) the regression coefficients for residence are rural = +0.025 and urban = -0.135. These are entered in the figure as the distances ab and af separating the rural (be) and urban (je) rates from the idealized whole-sample rate (ad). The areas abed = 16 · (-0.025) = 0.4 months and adef = 16 · (-0.135) = -2.2 months will be seen to be close to the actual rural and urban differences for this segment of the curve. Adding the increments for later durations produces the whole period estimates (ireg rural = (1 + 0.9 months, (ireg urban = |1 - 4.5 months. These figures agree with the actual differences.
Table 1 displays differences associated with other factors. In the multiple attribute regressions, middle schooling depresses breastfeeding durations about as strongly as lifetime urban residence relative to women who are rural and uneducated. Being at Parity 5 or above or working at home almost as sharply increases durations. The use of contraception has slightly smaller positive effects.
The patterns suggest that as Sri Lanka women become increasingly well educated and urban, and as family sizes decline, durations of breastfeeding will become shorter. Equally important

however, even among better-educated urban wives, breastfeeding continues longer than is typical of Western countries. In the circumstance, it is possible that the virtual abandonment of breastfeeding that for a time characterized the United States will be avoided.
As a final check on the quality of the regression procedure and of these findings, we have fitted the Sri Lanka data using the proportional hazards model:
(4)
where ly (n) is a regression estimate of the sample proportion breastfeeding at duration y among women with the set of attributes xn; ly is the proportion breastfeeding at duration y among women comprising the base category of Table 1; and b is the vector of regression coefficients. The model was fitted using the GLIM package (Baker and Neider, 1978;see also McDonald, 1981,for a detailed introduction to our use of the proportional hazards model with breastfeeding data, and Menken et al, 1981, for an application to marriage dissolution rates). Because of the limited capacity of the WFS computer, 3-month rather than single-month intervals were used. The ordinary least squares model used was that of Expression (2) and was also for 3-month intervals.
Table 2 displays the increment to the mean duration of breastfeeding associated with each regressor variable, and the ratio of the regression coefficient to its standard error for both the OLS and proportional hazards fittings.
Overall differences will be seen to be relatively small, and in only one case (primary school) would a variable be
