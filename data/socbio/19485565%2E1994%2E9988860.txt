ABSTRACT: Weaning at an appropriate age with appropriate foods is vital for the growth and health of infants. Weaning beliefs and practices were studied in two representative rural villages in Bangladesh by interviews with 180 mothers with infants between 4 and 12 months of age. Maternal parity and family size were not found to be related to weaning age. Family income and maternal education were consistently related to appropriate weaning. Bivariate controlled analysis showed that a mismatch between mothers' responses and actual weaning behavior toward infants 4-6 months old could be attributed to family poverty.

Weaning is the process of gradual termination of an infant's diet from breast milk to a family diet. The process of weaning should be of major concern in communities where income is low, knowledge about infant nutrition is poor, and environmental conditions are deleterious (Reddy, 1987). Malnutrition in infants in these countries make them susceptible to infection and increased mortality (Jelliffe, 1986). Nutritional deficiency occurring in childhood may have adverse lifelong mental and physical consequences. Malnutrition is widespread in most developing countries, and the condition is particularly serious in children less than three years of age. In many areas prolonged breast feeding is common, and nutritional problems generally arise after the first year of life due to delayed supplementation and inadequate weaning foods (Mitznerk et al., 1984).
The weaning period generally begins around the fourth month (WHO/ UNICEF, 1979; Jelliffe and Jelliffe, 1978). The age at which weaning is begun has been found to increase with de-

creasing family income and vice versa (Geervani, 1983). Many mothers believe that as long as there is enough breast milk, the child may not need any other food. Thus, the main defect in the current feeding practice is delayed supplementation and/or abrupt change in the food type. Attitude and knowledge are strongly influenced by socioeconomic status. In the same religious or cultural group, different weaning practices may be used commensurate with different income and educational levels (Geervani, 1983). Although economic status, maternal education and parity, family size, and sociocultural norms have been associated with appropriate weaning practices, their relative importance has rarely been assessed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This retrospective study was carried out in February and March of 1989 in two villages, Digarkanda and Bhatibarea, in the district of Mymensingh in Bangladesh. The study sites were selected purposively as representative of

rural society of Bangladesh which has been observed to be relatively homogeneous. All mothers, 180 in all, having children aged 4 to 12 months were studied. A structured questionnaire was developed and verified by a pretest before its use.
All the eligible mothers in the selected villages were interviewed by making door-to-door visits. The mothers were interviewed about their socioeconomic and demographic conditions and on the weaning status of their babies.
Data were analyzed to ascertain the role of socioeconomic and demographic factors on the practice of weaning of these rural mothers in Bangladesh. Stratification was done to control the interacting variables. Chisquare tests were done when considered appropriate for obtaining a conclusion.

Of the 180 mothers, 80 had children less than 6 months of age. Only 16 out of the 80 (20 per cent) had put their babies on a weaning diet. In total, 74 mothers (40 per cent) had weaned or were in the process of weaning their babies by 12 months of age (Table 1). In contrast to actual practice, a higher number of mothers (19 mothers, 24 per cent) having infants of less than 6 months of age thought that weaning should be done at least by the sixth month of an infant's age, and 85 per cent of them thought that weaning should be completed by 12 months of age (Table 2).
Of mothers having infants less than 6 months of age who did not wean their babies, 73 per cent thought that their

infants had not reached the proper age for weaning. Of these mothers, 19 per cent thought that weaning at this age would harm their infants physically. In contrast to the conventional belief, only 8 per cent of the mothers blamed their poverty for not weaning their babies (Table 3).
Maternal education, family size, mother's parity, and monthly family income were analyzed to see their roles as determinants of weaning at an appropriate age. Although an influence of maternal education was observed, a more consistent relationship was obtained between weaning at an appropriate age and monthly family income (Table 4 and 5) (p < 0.001).

analyses of these two variables were done by stratification. Among the families with the highest monthly income, parity or family size as usual did not show any consistent pattern (data not shown). The effect of maternal education, however, became more consistent now in these families. On the other hand, the effect of maternal education was lost when the respondents belonged to the lowest income group (Table 6). Moreover, the effect of family income was strong even when the respondents were illiterate (Table 7).

DISCUSSION
Although the sites for this study were selected purposively, the study individuals selected were similar to the population of other areas of Bangladesh in terms of the rates of literacy and age-wise weaning (Haque et al., 1987). Similar economic patterns and average family size have also been observed throughout Bangladesh in general (BBS, 1986).
Since appropriate weaning in terms of the age of weaning and the type of weaning food is so important, studies abound on this topic, especially in developing countries. The most probable factors that could possibly influence this practice may be the economic sta-

tus, level of family education, maternal parity and family size, and the socioreIigious culture (Greevani, 1983). These factors may influence weaning positively or negatively, directly and/or indirectly in conjunction with other cofactors. Higher parity, which may be a surrogate of a larger family size, could have a negative impact not only due to financial constraints, but also due to the less time that a mother has to spend on each of her children. On the other hand, with a higher parity a mother is supposed to develop more skill in child rearing. In effect, the role of these variables, however, have seldom been substantiated.
Social customs are intricately interwoven with the economic status and the level of family education. In this study, only 19 per cent of the respondents who did not wean their infants despite their appropriate age indicated a cultural taboo as a cause. This finding shows that in at least 80 per cent of the cases factors like level of education and family income could be the most important determinants of an appropriate weaning (Greevani, 1983). Level of education, which has a confounding relationship with economic status, sometimes is seen as the most important influencing factor in this regard (Greevani, 1983; Kabirullah et al., 1987). However, when appropriately controlled, the role of economic status seems to be more important than maternal education as has been shown in this study (Tables 4 through 7). It may, however, be possible that while income has stronger association with the age of weaning, maternal education may provide greater flexibility in the selection of the type of weaning food when the family economic status is better.

The appetite of a child has also been noted to influence the age and food of weaning (Greevani, 1983), but appetite in fact is often only a reflection of malnutrition resulting from poverty and low maternal education. Working

status of mothers has been observed to hasten the age of weaning. All in all, family income and maternal education seem to be the main determinants of the age and food of weaning, respectively, either directly or indirectly.

A unique and interesting observation in this study has been the mismatch between the actuality of weaning practices and the responses obtained in thecase of the nonweaning of infants at 4 to 6 months of theirage. Although 73 per cent of the mothers suggested that infants 4 to 6monthsold are not old enough for weaning, and only 8 per cent of the respondents

blamed poverty as the reason for not weaning at this age, bivariate controlled analysis in this study brought out the fact that poverty in fact is the most compelling reason for nonweaning at an appropriate age.This fact indicates the responses of the studysubjects maymislead a researcher if taken at face value.
