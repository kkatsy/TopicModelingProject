ABSTRACT: Cumulative fertility isanalyzed for four regions of Mexico, based on World Fertility Survey data of 1976-77:the State of Baja California, the Northwest region, the State ofJalisco, and the Northeast region. Based on stepwise regression methodology, the study compares results for twelve subsamples of married respondents, three age categories by four regions. The dependent variables are children ever born and children ever bom in the last five years. Migration, urban, educational, and occupational variables are included as independent variables. Regression results reveal level of education is the major, and negative, influence on fertility. Other results include specific negative effects for prior occupation, size of place of residence, and childhood place of residence. Fertility effects appear different for migration origin and destination regions, but more similar for younger ages. Effects of migration on fertility are small.

population growth, distribution, and change throughout Mexico.
Other segments of this project include municipio-levzl studies of the Mexican borderlands region (Pick et al., 1986, 1987, 1988c) a study of migration flows to Baja California (Butler et al., 1986), studies of Mexican interstate migration patterns (Fukurai et al., 1987, 1988), and a description of numerous socioeconomic variables in Mexico (Pick etal., 1988a).
PREVIOUS RESEARCH
This section looks at general trends in Mexican fertility, including results from the World Fertility Survey, briefly discusses related trends in U.S.-Hispanic fertility, and examines several reports and studies of regional fertility in Mexico.
Since 1970, fertility has dropped significantly in Mexico. The Mexican Total Fertility Rate (TFR) dropped from 5.9 in 1976-77 to 4.4 in 1986. By comparison, the U.S. TFR was 1.8 in 1986. The Mexican crude birth rate dropped from 44.2 per 1,000 in 1970 to 32 in 1986. The U.S. crude birth rate was 16in 1986. The drop in Mexican fertility stems from a number of factors, including increasing availability and prevalence of contraception, increasing literacy and education, increasing female employment, and more emphasis on family planning by the Mexican government (Wulf, 1982; International Family Planning Perspectives, 1982).
In recent years, there have been especially significant gains in contraception and education. For example, based on results of the 1981 Mexican Rural Family Planning Survey, Wulf reported that from 1977 to 1981the percentage of Mexican woman of reproductive age

who practiced contraception increased from 31 to 41 per cent while in the same period the Mexican TFR dropped by 15 per cent.
Education has proved important in previous studies as a negative influence on Mexican fertility. In recent decades, Mexican educational progress has been major. Education, as measured by per cent of population 6-14 years old matriculated in primary school increased from 45.3 per cent in 1940 to 59.2 per cent in 1970 and to 64.8 in 1980 (Zambrano, 1979; Secretaria de Programacion y Presupuesto, 1984). Although great strides have been made, education in Mexican rural areas remains backward. For example, in 1970, the per cent of schools offering a full six years of primary education was 89.9 per cent for urban schools, versus 19.6 per cent for rural schools. However, in the 1980's the latter percentage remains low and will continue to dampen Mexican educational prospects.
One of the major national surveys of Mexican fertility was the Mexican World Fertility Survey or WFS (also known as the Encuesta Mexicana de Fecundidad), conducted in Mexico between July 1976 and March 1977. Regional subsamples from this survey provide the data for the present research project. The following discussion gives some background on the survey and some of its major findings (Secretaria de Programacion y Presupuesto, 1978, 1979a, b, c; World Fertility Survey, 1980).
The Mexican Survey was a nationally representative, stratified, clustered area sample based on 2 or 3 stages and utilizing three questionnaires--community, household, and individual. The latter contained the WFS core questionnaire as well as additional questions specific to

Mexico and was successfully administered to 7,310 interviewees.
Among the most important WFS findings for Mexico were the following:
1. Mexican fertility decreased in the early 1970's (Gross Reproduction Rate decreased from 3.46 in 1967-69 to 3.00 in 1973-75), but still remained relatively high (Total Fertility Rate was 6.15 in 1973-75).
2. Educational level and fertility had a significant negative relationship. For instance, age-standardized cumulative fertility equalled 5.1 for respondents with no schooling, 3.4 for primary school graduates, and 2.1 for secondary school graduates.
3. Desire not to have additional children increased rapidly with the number of children and was correlated with educational level, size of place of residence, and economic development of the region.
4. Median age at marriage increased with more recent cohorts, greater education, and urban residence.
Although the present research focuses on Mexican fertility, it is important to mention briefly studies of Mexican-American fertility, both because of their methodological relevance and because Mexican fertility, especially in the Mexican borderlands, indirectly affects U.S.-Hispanic fertility. In perhaps the most comprehensive study to date of U.S.-Hispanic fertility, Jaffe etal., (1980) used 1970 U.S. census data to analyze five ethnic subgroups of the Hispanic population. The study's major findingsincluded generally higher Hispanic (versus Anglo) birth rates and a very strong negative influence of education on fertility. An important indirect research conclusion is that relatively high Mexican fertility levels will contribute to raising U.S. fertility levels due to the continuing substantial net migration of Mexicans into the United States.

Other studies of Hispanics have included examination of effects of generation and length of U.S. residence on Hispanic fertility (Bean and Swicegood, 1980-81; Bean et al., 1983).
Another relevant research area concerns fertility levels and causative factors in Mexican regions (Garcia y Garma, 1979; Hernandez et al., 1982; Hicks, 1974; Holian, 1970 and 1983; Pick et al., 1986, 1988c; Pillet, 1980; Poblab Staff, 1980; Seiver, 1975; Zambrano, 1979). Of these studies, four are pertinent to the present research.
Seiver (1975) studied Mexican fertility by weighted log linear regression techniques with samples from the 1960 and 1970 Mexican censuses of the 32 federal entities (i.e., 31 states plus the Federal District). He selected the adjusted child-woman ratio as a dependent variable. For independent variables, Seiver used measures of income, education, urbanization, occupational status, industrial composition, labor-force participation, and sex-ratio. The variables which accounted for the largest proportion of variance in fertility were income and sex ratio, which had positive influences in both 1960 and 1970. Other important independent variables were percentage economically active in white collar occupations (negative effect) and education (negative effect). This study gives a valuable set of benchmark results for 1960 and 1970 census data and is also methodologically sophisticated.
A second study is that of Garcia y Garma (1979). She sought to study fertility differences between regions and between rural and urban areas. She analyzed fertility for the federal entities and investigated the relationship of fertility with socioeconomic variables. Data were obtained from the Mexican censuses of 1960 and 1970 and from Mexi-

can vital statistics of 1969, 1970, and 1971. She concluded that these latter data were acceptable, although some analysts regarded them as inaccurate (e.g. Bruch et al., 1980). A General Marital Fertility Index, which consists of a weighted average of median number of children per married women over all fertile age groups, was used. A general Fertility Index was estimated by multiplying the Marital Fertility Index by an Index of Proportion of Women Married, which assumes negligible fertility of single women.
The General Fertility Index was used as the dependent variable and a group of "Intermediate Variables" as independent variables. These latter were surrogates for the well-known intermediate fertility variables of Davis and Blake. The regression analysis indicated that the most significant influences on the Index were per cent of women widowed, separated, divorced, and median age of sexual union.
Garcia y Garma then proceeded to construct a two-dimensional graph which, for each federal entity, presented the following information: (1) combined effects from the significant intermediate variables; (2) effects of socioeconomic factors, level of modernization in 1960, and standard of living in 1970; (3) General Fertility Index; (4) Marital Fertility Index; and (5) Index of Proportion Married. The two-dimensional analysis showed a wealth of information, too lengthy to detail here. It is clear from the graph that there is large regional variation in Mexican fertility and some of its correlates. This variation led Garcia y Garma to divide the Mexican states into four groups on the basis of fertility.
Based on a sample from Mexico City, Zambrano (1979) studied the relationship between fertility and levels of edu-

cation, using data from a special 1970 survey on migration into Mexico City. The analysis indicated the education at all levels, from primary to university, had the effect of reducing fertility. This is true even when factors such as social class and occupation are taken into account. Zambrano selected as a fertility measure the median number of children born living, by three age groups of mother, 15-24, 25-34, and 35 +. The effect of education was nearly always sharply negative. He divided occupation groups into employers, salaried employees, and manual laborers. There were inconsistent occupational effects on fertility with salaried employees generally having lower fertility.
Pick et al. (1986, 1988c) studied socioeconomic effects on fertility in the Mexican borderlands. These studies are unique in utilizing the municipio as a sampling unit. Subsamples included urban, rural, state, and border sampling units. Stepwise regression was used, with children ever born to women 20-29 and child-woman ratio as dependent variables, and literacy, labor-force participation (male and female), unemployment, underemployment, income, urbanization, and immigration as independent variables. Results indicate that literacy has the most important and negative effect on fertility. In the overall sample, the pair of labor-force participation variables exert important and opposite effects, female negative and male positive. Other secondary effects are noted for employment (negative), low income (mixed), urbanization (positive), female underemployment (negative), and immigration (positive).
MATERIALS AND METHODS The present research is based on a sample of data from the World Fertility

Survey (WFS). The present study utilizes four regional subsamples consisting of data on all respondents for the State of Baja California, the remainder of the Northwest region (consisting of the states of Baja California Sur, Sinoloa, Sonora, and Nayarit), the State of Jalisco, and the Northeast region (consisting of the states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas). Hereafter, the remainder of the Northwest region is referred to as the Northwest.
A previous study of migration to Baja California concluded that there was a steady immigration stream from 1900 to 1980 from a consistent group of states along the western Pacific coast (Butler et al., 1986). For example in 1980, in terms of the percentage of total lifetime migrants to Baja California from an origin state, the major sending states were Jalisco (19.9 per cent of immigrants), Sonora (12.0 per cent), and Sinoloa (11.8 per cent). In 1970, these respective percentages were 22.8,11.8, and 10.7. Although specific data for Baja California are not available, Vasquez's study (1984) for the Mexican borderlands region would indicate this internal stream is also an important one for staging of international migrants to the United States. Furthermore, studies of migration streams for Mexican undocumented international migrants to California reveal the same major states of origin (especially Jalisco and Sinoloa) as for the internal migration stream to Baja California. (Jones, 1984; Cantu, 1986).
It is the intent of the present study to compare levels of fertility and socioeconomic influences on fertility for two major origin regions (i.e., Jalisco and the Northwest region) and the destination region (i.e., Baja California) of this major internal migration stream.

The Northeast region is also included for comparison, since it is the principal destination region of a major internal migration stream in eastern Mexico, and it is also likely an important region for the staging of migrants to the United States (Vasquez, 1984; Jones, 1984). Results for Baja California and the Northeast will be compared to determine if there are similarities and/or differences in fertility.
For each region, the WFS subsamples are further subdivided by age and marital status as follows: married, 1524; married, 25-34; married, 35-49; and single, 15-24. The subsampling is necessary to control for age and marital status. The subsamples, single women 25-34 and single women 35-49, are excluded because their sizes are too small (less than 12) to allow for multivariate statistical analysis. Also, because most questions utilized in the study concern marital events, the subsample of single women 15-24 contains data for relatively few variables.
Subsample sizes are shown in Table 1. They vary in size from 15 (Baja California, single, 15-24) to 169 (Northeast, married, 35-49). The total population of the four regions constitutes 21.0 per cent of the Mexican 1980 population.
The following dependent variables were selected for the regression analysis: (1) children even born (CHILDEVBORN), and (2) children born in the past five years (CHILDEVBORN ( - 5 yrs)). These variables were selected because they are the best available indicators of fertility among the WFS survey variables, and they cover different portions of the life span: (1) refers to cumulative lifetime events while (2) refers to events in the last five years.
Of the selected independent variables, nine are dummy variables. Defini-

Stepwise regression analysis was performed on the dependent variables. The minimum criteria for entering variables was anFlevel of 1. The number ofsteps selected varied from 1to4 by subsample and was determined based on the relative significance levels for steps as well as the importance perceived by the investigators of variables for a particular subsample.

RESULTS
Cumulative fertility shows little variation by region (Table 5). Theonlyregional variation of note is somewhat lower fertility in the Northeast. On the other hand, by age category, there is the anticipated large increase in completed fertility, approaching a mean level of about 7 children perwoman for the age category 35-49.
Children born inthe last five yearsis shown in Table 6. There are consistently high values forage categories 15-24 and 25-34, dropping by about 50per cent for

group 35-49. For both children ever born and children ever born (last 5 years), there is negligible fertility for single respondents (values range from 0.04 to 0.13). This finding is not surprising considering the respondents' youth and underreporting.
By comparison Table 7 presents the same measures of fertility based on the Mexican census of 1980. After taking into account an overall 15 per cent drop in fertility, these data generally correspond to the WFS. However, it should be noted that while fertility dropped significantly compared to that of 1976-77 for the two older age groups, it remained virtually the same for age group 15-24. Also, the fertility rates for the Northwest and Jalisco are significantly higher than for Baja and the Northeast. This difference reflects the generally low regional level of fertility in the Mexican borderlands states compared to the medium level of fertility for the "sending regions" of the Northwest and Jalisco. It is likely the Northwest's relatively lower values in the WFS data is a sampling artifact. Hence, we conclude that for the

migration stream to Baja California, origin regions are significantly higher in cumulative fertility than the destination region. The fertility drop may be the result of better educational and economic conditions at destination; or, as results from a study in Korea suggest (Repetto, 1979), it may result from an accumulation of migrants, as migrants overall have lower fertility than nonmigrants which persists even at the destination due to problems finding permanent housing and the lack of extended family members for child care. Present regression results will be discussed later relative to this drop. Also, on the basis of raw data, the two "destination regions," the Northeast and Baja California, show comparable results.
Mean values for the independent variables are presented in Table 3. If we examine the inverse variable MIGSTAT, i.e., per cent not migrant, regional differences are apparent (see Table 8). Baja California has significantly more migration occurring than the other regions. This is seen especially for the two older age categories with 95-98 per cent

ized, fifth among the federal entities. Its high urbanization is also reflected in Jalisco's high values for SIZEPLACE. Another consistent regional difference is relatively lower percentages of town/ city origin for the Northwest and Northeast. While this finding may be explained for the Northwest as due to its more rural nature, for the urban Northeast, it is likely due to significant historical rural-to-urban migration streams (Browning and Feindt, 1969, discuss such migration for 1960 and earlier).
Education, measured by completed school years (LEVED), is significantly lower for married versus single subsamples. For the married samples, values range from 3.36 years (Jalisco, age 3549) to 6.26 years (Baja, age 15-24). On the other hand, for single subsamples (age 15-24), values range from 7.71 (Jalisco) to 9.27 (Baja California). This difference is revealed in the average educational difference of 3.3 years between single and married samples age 15-24. It reflects postponement or avoidance of marriage and/or lowered childbearing among the more educated, a result corroborated for a WFS 14 country sample by UNESCO (1983). Among the married subsamples, average educational level drops proportionately by age--a cohort effect related to the great educational strides of the past several decades.
Literacy, measured by LITERACY and PLITERACY, for most samples is highest for Baja California. Also, it decreases significantly between age categories, reflecting less educational attainment for older cohorts. It is nearly 100 per cent for subsamples of single women. Thisfindingcorroborates other studies which indicate greater education for single versus married respondents of similar age.

Occupational differences among the subsamples are reflected in values for PRIOROCCUP, i.e., occupation prior to marriage, and LASTOCCUP, i.e., last occupation since marriage. For the purposes of regression analysis these variables were coded as dummies (0 if the respondent did not work; 1if the respondent worked). As seen in Table 3, 51-66 per cent of respondents worked prior to marriage, whereas only 11-38 per cent worked after marriage. Thus, it may be inferred that the transition from single to married status resulted in about 30-40 per cent of respondents stopping work.
When analyzed in more detail, the results for variables PRIOROCCUP and LASTOCCUP reveal rather sharp differences between regions for certain occupations. For example, for age 2534, the percentage of currently employed respondents in the Professional/ Managerial category for Baja California, the Northwest, Jalisco, and the Northeast were 2.3,4.7,5.8, and 5.6 per cent respectively. For Clerical Workers, these per cents were 9.1, 5.5,12.5, and 18.3. No attempt is made in this paper to analyze these distinctions further, except to note that they differ significantly enough to warrant further investigation.
In contrast to a preponderance of respondents not currently working, virtually none of the respondents partners was not currently working. The results for partners seem remarkably low given Mexico's unemployment problems. However, Mexican census results also reveal a very low level of male unemployment. For instance, for the nation, the per cent unemployed for males, as measured by the category "desocupados" divided by the economically active population, was a mere 0.55 per cent, while a startling 26.9 per cent did not

Although the women in the subsample were currently married, they may have been married for only a short time and thus had less childbearing time. Also, for the

The significant negative influence of LEVED for all regions except Baja is consistent with overall results.
For Jalisco, there is a significant negative effect from PRIOROCCUP and for Baja a significant positive effect from NUMPLACES.
Ages 35-49.--The results are somewhat weaker, less consistent, and less readily interpreted for this age category than for the younger age categories. The weakening may be due in part to the longer time period during which childbearing occurs. As a result, childbearing of respondents varies to a greater extent in the appropriateness of timing relative to the independent variables. The most significant influence is again the negative one of LEVED.
LEVED is not present in the regression for Baja California, which was true for the previous age categories. The weakening of educational effect in Baja over age 25 may be due to the extra importance of the high rate and volume of inmigration between 1930 and 1970 to Baja California. For these age categories, variables related to migration and urbanization (NUMPLACES, PCHILDPLACE, and SIZEPLACE) displace education from its normal dominant position as a fertility influence.
For the other three regions, in addition to education, occupation (LASTOCCUP for the Northwest and PRIOROCCUP for the Northeast) exerts significant negative effects.
SOCIOECONOMIC INFLUENCES ON
FERTILITY FOR LAST FIVE YEARS BY AGE
AND REGION
Again, the regression results are generally consistent among regions and age categories. For all the regressions for fertility for last five years, three varia-

bles account for 69 per cent of the significant results and are consistent in direction. These variables are LEVED, SIZEPLACE, and CHILDPLACE, and are consistently negative.
Ages 15-24.--Education, the dominant variable, exerts a consistently negative effect. The other nonmigratory variable, LITERACY, has a surprising positive effect for the Northeast. This effect is contrary to a general conclusion of the research concerning education's dampening effect on fertility. LITERACY is assumed to have an effect similar to LEVED. Therefore, this result is regarded as spurious.
Ages 25-34.--For Baja and the Northwest, LEVED is again dominant and negative. For Jalisco, SIZEPLACE is the most important, and negative, effect. This variable is also present for the oldest ages. Since it was not present for Jalisco for the CHILDEVBORN dependent variable, its influence is hypothesized to be due to an effect, particular to Jalisco, in which recent fertility (i.e., last 5 years) for older age categories is decreased for residents of larger urban areas. Such an effect may be due to social conventions prevalent in Jalisco. This effect could only be confirmed by further special surveys in a size range of urban areas in Jalisco. For the Northeast, the most significant effect is a negative one for CHILDPLACE. A possible explanation is that an urban childhood leads to lowered fertility expectations. There is also a significant negative effect from partner's literacy. One interpretation of this effect might be that partner's literacy is acting as a substitute for respondent's education. However, the correlation of PLITERACY and LEVED is -0.152. Instead, a better interpretation is that

lower literacy in the partner leads to a less informed couple and hence lower fertility.
Ages 35-49.--For the oldest ages, the two most important general results are the disappearance of LEVED as a significant dependent variable and the lack of consistency of results among regions indicating regional differences. In contrast to children ever born, this lessening of consistency of results between regions may not be ascribed to a longer period of childbearing, but must reflect greater importance of region at older ages. LEVED doesn't appear in any regression. By contrast, for dependent variable CHILDEVBORN, ages 3 5 49, LEVED was significant in two out of four regressions. In other words, differ-

ences in educational levels affect cumulative cohort fertility, but not cohort fertility for the last 5 years. An interpretation is that fertility, ages 3 5 49, which averages 0.80 for the four regions, is often unplanned and sporadic (fertility is lower for this age category.) Hence, this older fertility is less dependent on careful planning, a function of educational level, and more on chance events.
The results for Baja California are remarkably similar for CHILDEVBORN ( - 5 yrs.) and CHILDEVBORN. The most significant variable, SIZEPLACE, has a negative influence. In Baja California, this result means that older age fertility is reduced in the large cities of Tijuana and Mexicali, relative to the

fallen back to second or third place in importance. Again, the unit of analysis is different from that in the present research. Other state studies mentioned earlier (Hicks, 1974; Garcia y Garma, 1979) did not include education or literacy as independent variables.
It is important to note that the present education effects weaken for the oldest age group. For children ever born, this finding may reflect a cohort effect. The childbearing of older cohorts occurred largely in the late 60's and 70's when the contraceptive knowledge argument was less relevant because of less prevalent contraception and the female occupational argument was less relevant because of lower female occupational participation. For children born in the last five years, the same arguments largely hold true because respondent's educational level is presumed to be rather stable from younger to older childbearing ages.
Major secondary effects on fertility were noted in selected subsamples for prior occupation, size of place, and childhood place of residence. Prior occupation is of greatest importance, visa-vis the other independent variables, for the Northeast region and the youngest and oldest age groups. This finding is similar to those in Korea (Repetto, 1979) and corresponds with related findings of increased age at marriage due to work in Korea (Repetto, 1979) and in Mexico (Garcia y Garma, 1979; World Fertility Survey, 1980). The specific effect for the Northeast is unexplained. A prior Mexican study showed a similar effect for Mexican borderlands municipios (Pick et al., 1988c, ms.), in which female labor force participation, ages 15 to 29, was significant and negative for the overall, high urbanization, rural, and nonborder adjacent subsamples.

However, eastern and western subsamples did not differ in the effect, so a selective effect corresponding to the present Northeast subsample was not corroborated. In the other prior studies considered, only Seiver (1975) included a similar variable, again female labor force participation, and no significant effects were noted.
Size of place also reveals a selective effect, significant and negative for the younger and middle age categories in Jalisco, as well as for the oldest age category in Baja California. This negative urban effect has much support in the international fertility literature for a variety of units of analysis and study methodologies. In studies of Mexico, the most relevant result at the individual level is a strong negative urban effect noted by Holian (1983), controlling for marital status and education. In Seiver's (1975) state-level study, urbanization dominated in importance for 1960 and 1970. Similarly, municipio-\eve\ results reveal a dominant and negative urbanization effect only for the U.S. border adjacent subsample.
In the present research, the negative effect of childhood place of residence is significant only for the Northeast region, and without clear explanation. We speculate that the negative direction results from a strong association between childhood and present places of residence. If it is assumed that social patterns of childhood place of origin are maintained, even after migration, the argument may have merit. However, this argument is weakened by the fact of heavy rural-to-rural migration in Mexico in the 60's and 70's.
A question addressed by the present study is the degree of similarity or difference in fertility effects between sending regions and destination for the major

Hence, effects are likely to remain the

same for most migrants after arrival, at least while still in the young age group.

CONCLUSION

For older females, effects on fertility are different, so it would be of interest to know for migrants, if effects after arrival resemble more effects of origin or destination. Unfortunately, the present data do not allow such an analysis.

The major findings of the present study are as follows:
1. Mean fertility as measured by children ever born was 4.34 for the 1976-77 WFS samples versus 3.69 for the Mexican census of 1980. Fertility varied
