In previous epidemiological studies of morbidity, attention has been relatively concentrated on measuring the main independent effects of biosocial variables (biosocial attributes of the susceptibles) on the vulnerability of individuals to disabling conditions prevalent in a cross-sectional population. Although social and demographic variables were included in the analysis, they mainly served as controls. Therefore, the relative impact from these variables was not easily clarified. It is expected, and often found, that the relationship between social factors and illness was obscured since the ordinary cross-classification analysis limited its power in discriminating the synergistic from the interaction effects of independent variables on the dependent variable. Moreover, difficulties may arise because (a) qualitative data may not satisfy statistical requirements necessary for the valid application of a specific method, e.g., regression analysis; and (b) demographic techniques in standardization limit the number of factors that can be analyzed simultaneously.
For analyzing the effects of social vari-

ables relative to stratification on the health variable, a binary multiple regression technique is employed. It provides an excellent alternative for further analyzing and overcoming problems encountered in low level statistical measurement and is a reasonably valid method to tease out main effects from interactions that result from the combination of status factors.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The data source for this research is the National Survey of Economic Opportunity (1970) conducted by the Bureau of the Census for the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1967. Since the focus of this study is on work-limiting chronic conditions, the sample was restricted to adult male heads of families and other unrelated males between the ages of 25 through 64. Moreover, in order to attain some degree_of homogeneity in the sample, only whites who were in the labor force in 1966 were included. In this analysis, the total sample consisted of 10,621 white adult males.
Two status dimensions, education and occupation, were employed in this study.

Each status dimension is trichotomized into high, medium, and low rank. Those who have completed the years of schooling for less than 9, 9 to 11, and 12 or more are ranked as having low, medium, and high educational status, respectively. Occupation, denned as the longest civilian job of an individual in 1966, is categorized into white-collar occupations (high), blue-collar occupations (medium), and others (including service workers and farm workers). Thus, nine possible combinations of the two status dimensions are categorized into three broad groups. When two status dimensions are either in the high, medium, or low categories, there is obviously a consistent status. When one status is high and the other is low, there is a sharply inconsistent status. The four residues of status combinations are considered as the moderately inconsistent status (where there is onehigh-and-other-medium or one-mediumand-other-low status).
In the 1967 SEO, poverty status was determined for each family (or unrelated individual) by relating the 1966 income of its members to a standard set of poverty level income thresholds, used in federal statistical reports to identify the poor. These thresholds were developed by the Social Security Administration (SSA) in 1964 and were further revised by a Federal Interagency Committee in 1969 (Orshansky, 1969). The poverty income cutoffs were adjusted by family size, the sex of the family head, number of children under 18 years old, and farm-nonfarm residence. The adjustments made for the SSA poverty thresholds also take into account differences in the cost of living between farm and nonfarm families. These thresholds are revised in terms of annual changes in the consumer price index. For example, in 1966, the poverty thresholds ranged from $1,319 for a female unrelated individual 65 years old and over living on a farm to $5,903 for a

nonfarm family with a male head and seven or more persons (from the forthcoming report by Gladys K. Bowles, A. L. Bacon, and P. N. Ritchey, "Rural-urban Migrants, 1967: A Comparison of the Demographic, Social, and Economic Characteristics of Rural-urban Migrants with Other Population Groups," to be published by the University of Georgia and Office of Economic Opportunity).
Those who lived under or at the poverty threshold were considered to be in poverty; whereas those who lived above the threshold were classified as not being in poverty. It is expected, and often found, that poverty in itself may have a significant bearing on health. Therefore, the morbidity factor is independently analyzed for two subsamples, the poor and nonpoor. The existence of chronic conditions caused by a particular disease, injury, or impairment which limited an individual's ability to work for more than three months is called a work-limiting chronic condition or simply, "morbidity" (Wan, 1971).
In this study, the additive effect of education and occupation variables on morbidity is examined using a binary variable multiple regression technique in which all the variables are binary (Boyle, 1970; Elwood, MacKenzie, and Cran, 1971; Feldstein and Butler, 1965; Shah and Abbey, 1971). Each variable represents a single subclass of a factor and is assigned a value of one if it is in the subclass, and zero otherwise. Each factor (e.g., education) is transformed into a number of regressor variables (e.g., high and medium educational status) equivalent to the number of the subclass minus one (Feldstein, 1966). The use of binary variables does not involve making any assumptions about the forms of relationship and distribution (Suits, 1957; Cox, 1970).
A regression equation is formulated as follows, assuming no interaction:

The above equation is further employed in the analysis of two subsamples, the poor and nonpoor. The proposed model estimates the main effects of status factors (4 dummy variables) on morbidity, and also provides regression coefficients which can be used to obtain predicted proportions of morbidity. Empirically, it is possible to extend the model by including more relevant factors in the equation, and it may likely increase the validity of prediction. In a review of studies relative to status inconsistency, it

was found that "status inconsistents" employed as an interaction term in the analysis may yield a positive increment in the dependent variable (Jackson and Burke, 1965). Thus, the present study will include "status inconsistents" as interaction terms in addition to the simple additive model. It is hypothesized that "status inconsistents" do exert a significant influence on morbidity, irrespective of poverty status. Moreover, it is expected that the additive model including interaction terms may fit the data better than the ordinary additive model in the estimation of morbidity.
RESULTS
The regression equations for the simple additive model including four dummy variables are shown in Table 1. The regression coefficients indicate the direction of relationships between status variables and morbidity. In the first equation, an individual with low educational and occupational ranks has zero on all dummy variables, and the predicted probability of morbidity is 29.7, which is just the intercept of the equation. If one has high educational and occupational ranks, his predicted morbidity condition is reduced by more than 3 times, to 8.0 (i.e., M = 0.297 -- 0.133 -- 0.08S).

sistent, moderately inconsistent, and sharply inconsistent). The coefficients of the four status terms retain the same negative sign, although all of them are reduced slightly in size. For the three interaction terms, the sharply inconsistent has a slightly higher coefficient, independent of the additive effects of education and occupation. The estimated equations for the poor and nonpoor are slightly different since insignificant terms have been dropped off from the original equation (West was performed to determine the significance of effect).
From Equations 4, 5, and 6 we obtained new predicted proportions (P') of morbidity (Table 2). The chi-square test is again used to detect significant differences in the numbers between observed and new predieted morbidity. It is found that none of these three equations will predict the numbers of morbidity significantly different from the observed numbers. The chi-square values are 0.147, 1.763, and 0.531 for the total, in-poverty, and not-in-poverty, respectively. It is also worth noting that

moderately inconsistent, as well as sharply inconsistent status, does have a significant effect on morbidity for the total and the nonpoor. Deviations of the predicted from the observed morbidity are smaller for the new additive-interaction model than for the simple additive model,
Table 4 summarizes proportions of morbidity by comparing observed and predieted averages for three status inconsistent groups of the total, the poor, and the nonpoor. Morbidity increased as the level of status inconsistency increased for the nonpoor, but no such apparent positive relationship existed for the poor or the total. The deviations of the predicted from the observed proportions for 3 status inconsistent groups are presented on the right-hand side of Table 4. Deviations obtained from the additive-interaction model are smaller than those of the simple additive model, These lead us to confirm our hypothesis that the additive-interaction model fits the data better than the simple additive model in estimation of morbidity.

term "status inconsistents" is theoretically justifiable in terms of sociological analysis (Battistella, 1970; Blalock, 1966, 1967; Hyman, 1966; Meyer and Hammond, 1971).
CONCLUSIONS
The relationship between two status dimensions (education and occupation) and work-limiting morbidity is examined, using data obtained from 1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity and analyzed by a binary multiple regression method. An additive regression model does not adequately explain the susceptibility of an individual to morbidity by a single status dimension. Hence, an alternative model using different combinations of status ranks for education and occupation was formulated to examine the existence of interaction effects.
The results presented above clearly show that interactions are not negligible in morbidity study. The additive-interaction model fits the data better than the simple additive model in estimation of morbidity. It is important to note that the binary variable multiple regression analysis may not only specify the main effects but also detect interactions of social variables in

relation to morbidity. However, a valid application of this technique should rely on strong theoretical support in the explanation of interactions.
This research substantiates Jackson and Burke's findings (1965) in a stress-symptom study that status inconsistent terms may have an adverse effect on health. The findings pertaining to status inconsistency and morbidity can be interpreted as an indication of the association between social stress and morbidity. It is plausible to draw an inference concerning the underlying etiological chains between social stress and diseases. Furthermore, the findings of the effects of education-occupation inconsistency on morbidity confirm Kasl and Cobb's conclusion that the payoff in morbidity research (utilizing the concept of status inconsistency) is most likely to come from emphasis on education-occupation incongruence on men (Kasl and Cobb, 1971).
