Age Heaping in Recent National Censuses: An Addendum

In an earlier article in this journal (Stockwell and Wicks, 1974), we presented a brief description and analysis of the extent and pattern of digit preference and avoidance in the age statistics of 64 national censuses taken since 1965. Here we supplement that article by presenting additional data on this phenomenon in 37 censuses that have been taken since 1970.
As noted in our earlier article, the tendency for persons to "round-off" to certain preferred digits when reporting numerical data, such as age or year of birth, often leads to a marked pattern of "heaping" throughout an age distribution. That is, there will be an overrepresentation of persons with ages or birth years ending in the preferred digits (0, 5, and to a lesser extent 8), and an underrepresentation of ages or birth years ending in the remaining digits (especially 9 and 1).
As before, the technique selected to measure the extent of digit preference/avoidance in age statistics is the "blending" method described by Robert J. Myers (1940). This is a technique which derives a "blended" population that is essentially a weighted sum of the number of persons reporting ages ending in each of the ten terminal digits. Assuming no systematic irregularities in age reporting, the "blended"

sum at each terminal digit should approximate 10 per cent of the total "blended" population. If the sum at any given digit exceeds 10 per cent of the total "blended" population, it indicates overselection of ages ending in that digit (digit preference). Conversely, a sum that is less than 10 per cent of the "blended" total indicates underselection of ages ending in that digit (digit avoidance). An overall measure of the extent of digit preference/avoidance is the Index of Preference, which is denned as one-half of the absolute sum of the deviations for each of the ten terminal digits.
Our previous research has suggested that an overall index value of 3.0 is a reasonable cut-off point to separate out countries whose statistics may be regarded as generally accurate and relatively free from bias. Among the 37 new countries examined here, the following 21 had Index of Preference values below 3.0:
Index of Preference less than 1.0.--Argentina, 1970; Australia, 1971; Canada, 1971; Ireland, 1971; New Zealand, 1971; Scotland, 1971; United Kingdom, 1971.
Index of Preference between 1.0 and 1.9. --Belgium, 1970; Federal Republic of Germany, 1970; Finland, 1970; Puerto Rico, 1970; Republic of Korea, 1970; Thailand, 1970.

16 countries supported our explanation of the pattern of age preference (see Table2). That is, the pattern of digit preference is a function of thebase of thenumber system and reflects a tendency to "prefer" digits that are multiples of the divisors of the base of that system (Turner,19S8; Stockwell, 1966). Since the base-ten system with which we are here dealing has10, 5, and 2 as divisors, preference should attach to ages ending in multiples of these numbers, with the greatest preference being shown to ages divisible by the base itself (i.e., ages ending in zero). Ages notdivisible by 10 but divisible by 5 should rank second in preference, while among those

ages ending in 1 or 9, or those numbers that flank the most highly preferred zero.
The data presented in these two tables clearly reinforce our earlier conclusions that (1) heaping at preferred digits is a major

characteristic of the age statistics of many non-Western countries, and (2) pattern of age heaping is one that can readily be explained in terms of the base-ten number system.
