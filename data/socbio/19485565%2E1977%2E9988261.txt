Breast-feeding: Its Effects on Post-partum Amenorrhea

ABSTRACT: Data is presented on lactation and post-partum amenorrhea for 323 women in Banaras, India, ages 15-35 who had one live birth and for 250 women with two live births. Data on prolonged breast-feeding habits and amenorrhea show that the mean duration of lactation is about two-and-a-half times the mean duration of post-partum amenorrhea. It appears that an increase in the duration of breast-feeding is accompanied by an increase in the length of post-partum amenorrhea. The average period of amenorrhea was shorter in cases where lactation ceased because of infant mortality under age three months. Lactation and post-partum amenorrhea have coefficients of correlation of 0.275 and 0.257 in the case of first and second births respectively. While small, the figures are statistically significant. The use of gamma also showed that lactation probably has some effect on post-partum amenorrhea.

The need to measure the changes in the fertility behavior of a population through increasingly realistic stochastic models has stimulated considerable interest in the study of physiological factors affecting fertility, such as lactation and post-partum amenorrhea. In formulating models for the number of births or the number of conceptions to a couple during a specified time, Perrin and Sheps (1964), Sheps and Perrin (1966), Singh (1963, 1968), Singh and Bhattacharya (1970) and Pathak (1970) have assumed a constant duration for the "rest period" comprising the duration of pregnancy and post-partum amenorrhea. Srinivasan (1966), in his model for inter-live birth intervals, assumes the distribution of post-partum amenorrhea to be an asymmetrical triangle, while Yadava (1966) takes it to be a chi-square distribution. Each of them has given his own reasonings, supported by the nature of the data used, for his approximations. It has been observed by the author (Saxena, 1966), and in other studies as well, that the length of

amenorrhea varies from woman to woman. Factors associated with lactation are believed to play a fundamental role in the variation. Henry (19S6), Tietze (1961), Potter (1963), Potter et al. (196S), Salber et al. (1965), Knödel and Walle (1967), and Jain et al. (1970) have tried to prove through direct or indirect evidence, that lactation affects resumption of menstruation after childbirth.
The purpose of this paper is to present original data on lactation and post-partum amenorrhea collected in a demographic survey conducted . by the author in Bañaras (Saxena, 1966, ms.) and to analyze within the limits of the data the effect, if any, of lactation on the resumption of menstruation after childbirth.
The information collected in the survey relate to the fertility history of a sample of 709 couples, which covered nearly half of the population engaged in clerical occupations in Bañaras Hindu University. However, the information pertaining to lactation and post-partum amenorrhea presented here was available only for 323

each other as indicated by the coefficient of correlation (0.78). Generally, the pattern of breast-feeding in the case of the first two successive births for a given mother is approximately the same, provided both the children survive.
INFANT MORTALITY, LACTATION, AND
POST-PARTUM AMENORRHEA
It has been observed that all the mothers of the present sample nursed their children right after their confinements, and in all the cases breast-feeding was continued till the death of the infant. Obviously, infant mortality interrupted breast-feeding, and the duration of lactation is then equal to the age of the infant at death.
The length of amenorrhea along with the duration of lactation following the birth of those children who died in infancy are given in Table 2. The length of postpartum amenorrhea and of lactation are shown following first and second births when the infant survived either 0-3 months or 4-12 months. It is seem from the table that the average length of amenorrhea increased when the infant

survived between four and twelve months as compared with cases where the child died within three months. Results similar to first-order births have been obtained in the case of second births, where a difference in the mean lengths of post-partum amenorrhea for the two durations of breast-feeding considered here is also found.
LACTATION AND POST-PARTUM AMENORRHEA
FOLLOWING FIRST AND SECOND BIRTHS
More precise evidence of prolonged breast-feeding habits and the influence of lactation on post-partum amenorrhea can be gathered from Tables 3 and 4. The tables show the length of post-partum amenorrhea by the duration of lactation following first and second births respectively.
It is observed that for the majority of the nursing mothers, lactation outlasts amenorrhea. However, 8.5 per cent of the women in the case of the first birth, and nearly the same proportion (8.1 per cent) in the case of the second birth, have stopped breast-feeding prior to the onset of

their menstruation. The mean duration of lactation is about two-and-a-half timesthe mean duration of the post-partum amenorrhea, being IS.S months of lactation after first births and IS.2 months following second births, with the respective lengths of post-partum amenorrhea being 6.01 and 6.46 months.

From both the tables it appears that an increase in the duration of breast-feeding is accompanied by an increase in theaverage length of post-partum amenorrhea. It seems that the two are interrelated. The correlation coefficient between lactation and post-partum amenorrhea is found to be 0.275 in the case of the first birth and

O.2S7 in the case of the second birth, figures which are statistically significant. The fitted regression lines are
Y = 0.1334 X + 3.9421
and
Y = 0.1379 X + 4.3609
where Y denotes the duration of postpartum amenorrhea andX the duration of lactation.
However, a more appropriate index for investigating the relationship between lactation and post-partum amenorrhea is gamma, proposed by Goodman and Kruskal (1954, 1963), which measures the association between them and not simply the linear relationship as does the correlation coefficient. This index of association is appropriate in situations where both classifications have intrinsic and relevant order.
For the present data, let us consider the two polytomies defined according to the durations of lactation and post-partum amenorrhea where direct ordering is of interest. Suppose that two mothers, each of whom nursed her first child, are taken independently and at random from the population (Table 3), and the respective durations of post-partum amenorrhea and of lactation for each mother are noted. We calculated the conditional probabilities that these two randomly chosen mothers will have the same order in both the classifications and also for unlike orders, given no tie. These conditional prob-

abilities, values of gamma and the 95 per cent confidence limits for gamma obtained for the first and the second births, are given in Table 5.
Clearly, there seems to be a greater chance of like order than of unlike order, meaning, thereby, positive association. This finding implies that if two women are chosen at random from the population of mothers who breast-fed their children and if the duration of lactation in the case of the first woman is longer than the other, the chances are greater that the postpartum amenorrhea of the former will also be longer than that of the latter.
IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
On the basis of the information presented, it can be conjectured that, generally, the pattern of breast-feeding for the first two successive births for a given mother is approximately the same, provided both children survive. The coefficient of correlation between the durations of lactation in the case of first and second child is 0.78. In both the cases, on the average, mothers nursed for about fifteen months.
As pointed out by the author (Saxena, 1966), the average duration of postpartum amenorrhea in the present sample is short as compared with the average length of this period in various studies conducted in different parts of India (see Baxi, 1957, p. 49; Dandekar, 1959, p. 62; and Potter et al., 1965, p. 394). It may, however, be mentioned that the mothers

in those studies breast-fed their children for more or less the same length of time as in the present sample. Since we restricted our analysis to first and second births only, the women were mostly younger, and this fact might account for a shorter duration of amenorrhea.
Although we have observed no statistically significant differences in the average duration of lactation for male and female children, it appeared that a male child, on the average, was breast-fed for a longer period than a female child. For example, among first-order births 39 males as compared to 28 females and for secondorder births 25 males as against 13 females were breast-fed for more than 24 months. It is usually seen that a male child is more carefully brought up and, therefore, breast-feeding might have been prolonged. Also, the mean length of postpartum amenorrhea following a male birth was comparatively longer, although not long enough to be statistically significant. This area deserves further investigation.
Equally important here would be to discuss the findings on the length of postpartum amenorrhea where breast-feeding ceased due to the death of the infant. It is observed that the average period of amenorrhea is shorter in cases where the infant died within three months. Since breast-feeding was continued till the death of the infant, the child who survived longer was obviously nursed for a longer period of time. As the observations suggest, the difference in the average lengths of amenorrhea may be attributed to the difference in the durations of breastfeeding.
As regards the length of amenorrhea when the child survived more than a year, it has been observed that the average period of amenorrhea increased with the increase in the duration of breast-feeding. It seems that lactation and post-partum

amenorrhea are loosely interrelated, the coefficients of correlation being 0.275 and 0.257 in the case of first and second births respectively. Although these coefficients appear to be small when compared with values found in other similar studies, they are statistically significant. However, it is felt that the coefficient of correlation may not be appropriate here to measure the relationship between lactation and amenorrhea. An index gamma is probably better for investigating the relationship between them, because it is based upon more general assumptions and compares the probabilities of like and unlike orders in the two polytomies defined according to the durations of lactation and amenorrhea.
From the observed data, these probabilities were calculated for two women chosen independently and at random. If the first woman's lactation period is longer than that of the second woman, the probability is higher that the first woman's amenorrhea will also be longer than that of the other.
From the evidence gathered here and through other studies, it may be concluded that breast-feeding has some effect (although not very explicit) on post-partum amenorrhea. All the same, it may not be the sole agent responsible for prolonging amenorrhea. There may be physiological, dietary, and other factors that affect the resumption of ovulation after the termination of a pregnancy.
