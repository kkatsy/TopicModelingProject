ABSTRACT: In the present paper 702 families have been studied belonging to different endogamous groups in three multicaste villages of Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradesh. It is observed that 33.76 per cent of families are consanguineous marriages. With regard to the types of marriages, 12.11 per cent are uncle-niece; 14.10 per cent are matrilateral cross-cousins; 5.84 per cent are patrilateral cross-cousins; 0.57 per cent are first cousins once removed, and 1.14 per cent are second cousins. There are only six couples (0.86 per cent) in intercaste marriages. The coefficient of inbreeding for autosomal and sex-linked genes, 0.045 and 0.059, respectively, for Chakalis which are higher than Kalingas (F = 0.03; F1 = 0.038), Segidis (F = 0.031; F1 = 0.041), Velamas (F = 0.026; F1 = 0.036), Vysyas (F = 0.027; F1 = 0.034), Malas (F = 0.017; F1 = 0.026), and others (F = 0.026; F1 = 0.032). The ttests for mean marriage distances are statistically significant among all castes, but chisquares for intergroup difference of consanguineous and nonconsanguineous marriages are statistically significant only among Kalingas and Chakalis, Vysyas and Chakalis, and Malas and Chakalis.

The high rates of consanguineous marriages among the populations of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have been extensively documented (Dronam Raju and Meera Khan, 1963; Centerwall and Centerwall, 1966; Sanghvi, 1966; Murty and Jamil, 1972; Rao and Inbaraj, 1977, 1979, 1980). Studies in many parts of the world have shown a significant decline in the frequency of consanguineous marriages (Pohlman, 1951; Deraemacker, 1958; Blanco and Chakraborty, 1975, etc.). However, in South India over the past few decades consanguineous marriages have not declined significantly (Andhra Pradesh: Dronam Raju and Meera Khan, 1963; Sanghvi, 1966; Chakravartti, 1968;

Reid, 1973; Veerraju, 1973; Roychoudhury, 1976; Rami Reddy and Papa Rao, 1978a, b; Papa Rao and Rami Reddy, 1983; Venu Gopal Rao and Murty, 1984; Chengal Reddy, 1984.

Since the South Indian populations are known to have practiced various types of consanguineous marriages for centuries, they provide an excellent opportunity for studying the genetic effects of inbreeding. The present study is aimed at understanding the pattern of

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data were collected from three multicaste villages of Ambeerupeta, Susaram, and Dandulakshmipuram in Narasannapeta taluk, Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradesh (Figure 1). There are altogether 702 families which include 210 Kalingas, 96 Segidis, 102 Ve-

lamas (agriculturists); 65 Vysyas (traders), 80 Malas, (farm laborers), 52 Chakalis (washermen); 97 other castes which include 28 Jangams (bards/folk musicians), 30 Patnaiks (village accountants), 10 Viswa Brahmins (blacksmiths), 11 Dammalas (agriculturists), 16 Kapus (agriculturists) and 2 Neyyalas (small businessmen).
Information on different types of consanguineous marriages was ascertained from respondent families and village elders. The distance between the birth places of spouses, called marriage distance, was estimated in kilometers. The coefficient of inbreeding F and F\ was calculated according to Wright (1922).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Various consanguineous and nonconsanguineous (including caste exogamous) marriages with their percentages are presented in Table 1. It shows that out of 702 families studied, 12.11 per cent of marriages are of uncle-niece, 14.10 per cent are of matrilateral crosscousins, 5.84 per cent are of patrilateral cross-cousins, 0.57 per cent are of first cousins once removed, and the remaining 1.14 per cent are of second cousins. The type of consanguinity by caste and coefficient of inbreeding are reproduced in Table 2.
It can be seen from Table 2 that the overall rate of consanguinity is high among Chakalis (50 per cent) compared to other caste groups (Kalingas, 34.29 per cent; Segidis, 37.50 per cent; Velamas, 35.29 per cent; Vysyas, 29.24 per cent, Malas, 25.00 per cent; and others, 28.86 per cent). The coefficient of inbreeding for autosomal and sex-linked genes, 0.045 and 0.059, respectively, for Chakalis which are higher than Kalingas (F = 0.030 and Fl = 0.038), Segidis

(F = 0.031 and Fl = 0.041), Velamas (F = 0.026 and Fl = 0.036), Vysyas (F = 0.027 and Fl = 0.034), Malas (F = 0.017 and Fl = 0.026), and others (F = 0.026 and Fl = 0.032) (Table 2). The f-tests for mean marriage distance are statistically significant among all castes (Tables 3 & 4), but X2 for intergroup difference of consanguineous and nonconsanguineous marriages are statistically significant only among Kalinga and Chakalis, Vysyas and Chakalis, and Malas and Chakalis (Table 4).
ENDOGAMY
All the marriages (99.14 per cent), except 1out of the 96 among the Segidis, 2 among 80 Malas, 1 out of 52 Chakalis, and 2 among 11 Dammalas have been concentrated between individuals belonging to the respective division of the same community. Only 6 exogamous marriages (0.86 per cent) have taken place among the men and women of the different castes (Table 1). These exogamous unions indicate a small amount of gene flow from one caste population to another caste. The admixture is rather

insignificant from the point of view of identifying the populations as endogamous units. Such small exceptions to endogamy can obviously be expected to occur in all populations and does not provide sufficient evidence against considering these caste populations as breeding isolates. It is reasonable to expect a similarly small degree of admixture among other caste populations if more data on marriages were available for them.
It may be noted that the exogamous marriages have not occurred between any pair of the populations under study and thus it can be assumed that the twelve castes (See Table 2) inhabiting these villages satisfy Wright's island model (Wright, 1969).
Another factor which contributes to the breeding and genetic isolation within each of these populations is a high incidence of matings between closely related individuals, whose frequency for all castes in three multicaste villages ranges from 25per cent to 50 per cent. Their poor economy and preference for mates within kin groups are some of the reasons for the higher incidence of consanguinity.

ISOLATION BY MARRIAGE DISTANCE
Although the twelve groups of populations have been treated as breeding isolates, the wide area of continuous distribution of these populations calls for an investigation into the nature and extent of the geographical breeding isolation within each of these three village populations. For this purpose, the data on distance between the birth place of spouses (called marriage distance) have been analyzed (Table 3). The Kalingas show a low mean marriage distance of 9.25 ± 0.97 kms. while Vysyas score a higher mean distance of 31.23 ±4.98 kms. The Segidis, Velamas, Malas, Chakalis, and others have a mean marriage distance that ranges from 11.64 to 28.17 kms. The low value for the Kalinga may be due to higher density of this population in the neighboring villages. Because of these low mean marriage distances in these populations, groups of populations within each division are isolated by distance and form small overlapping Mendelian populations, approaching a stepping stone model with continuous variation of genetic traits between adjacent groups of people.
