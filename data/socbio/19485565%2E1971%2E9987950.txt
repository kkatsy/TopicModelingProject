All mammalian infants possess the ability to metabolize lactose, a complex sugar which occurs naturally only in milk, (Hazid and Ballou, 19S7). Absorption of lactose is made possible by the presence in the jejunum and other portions of the small intestine of the enzyme lactase. Lactase is responsible for converting lactose from an unabsorbable disaccharide into two absorbable monosaccharides, glucose and galactose. Ingestion of lactose by a lactasedeficient individual characteristically gives rise to symptoms of gastric distress, including gas, cramps, and diarrhea. There is one exception in the mammals, the California sea lion (Zalophas calijornianus), which has no lactose in the milk and whose pups are lactase deficient (Kretchmer and Sunshine, 1967).
Most mammals do not retain the ability to metabolize lactose beyond infancy, however. In all nonhuman species investigated to date, lactase levels are uniformly high throughout the period of high infantile maternal dietary dependence, but fall rapidly some time prior to adulthood to

the point of lactase deficiency. Lactase activity in suckling rats begins decreasing at about fifteen to sixteen days following birth (Rubino, Zimbalatti, and Auricchio 1964), and low levels of activity are found after four weeks in the rabbit (Doell and Kretchmer, 1962), after five weeks in the pig (Walker, 1959), and after nine months in the cow (Heilskov, 1952).
In man, the picture is somewhat different. Adults in some populations tend to be lactase deficient and in other populations the opposite is true. Populations with a high incidence of lactase deficiency are: Australian aborigines, 80-90% (Elliott, Maxwell, and Vawser, 1967); Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, and Koreans, 95lOO^o (Chung and McGill, 1968; Huang and Bayless, 1968); American Indians, 67% (Welsh et al., 1967); the Baganda of East Africa and Bantu of South Africa, 44-90% (Cook and Kajubi, 1966; Jersky and Kinsley, 1967); American Negroes, 70-77% (Bayless and Rosensweig, 1966; Cuatrecasas, Lockwood and Caldwell, 1965; Littman, Cady, and Rhodes, 1968; Welsh et al, 1967); Eskimo (GudmandHo"yer and Jarnum, 1969); and New

Guinea natives (Bolin, Crane, and Davis, 1968).
Populations with a low incidence of lactase deficiency are: Europeans and their descendants (Bolin, Crane, and Davis 1968; Auricchio et al., 1963; Littman, Cady, and Rhodes, 1968; Newcomer and McGill, 1967; Welsh et al., 1967; Haemmerli et al., 1965; Cuatrecasas, Lockwood, and Caldwell, 1965; Bayless and Rosensweig, 1966; Huang and Bayless, 1968; Davis and Bolin, 1967; Sheehy and Anderson, 1965); and the Nilotic Negroes of East Africa (Cook and Dahlquist, 1968; Cook and Kajubi, 1966). The incidence of lactase deficiency does not exceed 20% in the above populations with one exception, England, with an incidence of 22% (McMichael, Webb, and Dawson, 1966). A most puzzling high incidence has been reported from Israel: Sephardic Jews from North Africa, 62.5%; Sephardi from other areas, 72.2%; Ashkenazi Jews from Europe, 79.2% (Gilat et al., 1970). These extraordinary findings from Israel will be commented on later.
In man, no association has been found between individual lactase levels and individual lactose intake (Chung and McGill, 1968; Cook and Kajubi, 1966; Welsh et al., 1967; Flatz, Saengudom, and Sanguanbhokhai; 1969). Attempts to raise lactase levels in deficient individuals have failed (Cuatrecasas et al., 1965; Keusch, et al., 1969<z,6; Rosensweig and Herman, 1968). Cain et al. (1969) fed weanling rats increasing concentrations of lactose, from 10% to 60%, and though the animals experienced bowel distress and showed other symptoms of lactose intolerance, they grew in weight and at the seventh week showed an increased lactase level over the controls. One question arises. Is the lactase the infantile or the adult form? Did Cain and his coworkers in effect stimulate the falling infant lactase

level in the weanlings? As mentioned, these tests have not been productive in man. Thus, on the basis of these reports and three family studies conducted among Europeans and Thais (Ferguson and Maxwell, 1967; Fine et al., 1968; Flatz and Saengudom, 1969), most researchers have concluded that the trait has a strong genetic component, with adult lactase production being dominant.
Given the pattern of distribution of adult lactase deficiency in man, its presence in some populations and its absence in many more, and accepting its genetic base, though this has yet to be proved, some interesting questions concerning selective pressures for man can be entertained. McCracken (1970) has offered an explanation for the pattern of distribution. Since milk is the only natural source of lactose, it would be inefficient for an animal to continue to produce lactase beyond the period of infantile need. He further states that prior to the domestication of dairy animals and the introduction of lactose into the adult diet, selective pressures favored the more efficient lactase deficient adult who did not waste precious metabolic energy reproducing enzymes for which no need existed. Pauling (1968) says that natural selection will favor the organisms that do not produce required metabolic substances at optimal levels over those that do. With the introduction of lactose into the diets of some populations upon the domestication of dairy animals, and the growth of dependency of the adults on the lactose, selective pressures would change and favor the adult lactase producer. These pressures continuing over sufficiently long periods of time would account for the incidence of lactase producers found in modern populations. If this model is valid and high levels of adult lactase sufficiency are a result of dairy animal domestication, and hence culturally based, then adult

nonhuman primates should be lactase deficient. Such a finding would suggest that the trait, adult lactase sufficiency, is indeed a relatively new development in man's evolution. If, however, a large percentage of adult nonhuman primates exhibit high levels of lactase, this would suggest that the trait goes much further back in primate evolution and probably is not culturally based.
The results of this investigation into the levels of adult lactase in the owl, bonnet, and rhesus monkeys show that these animals can be classified as adult lactase deficient. Coupled with the pattern of distribution of adult lactase sufficiency in man, these findings tend to support the contention that the high rates of this enzyme in man are due to selective pressures brought about by the introduction of lactose into the adult diet following the development of dairy technology and hence constitute an important example of the interdependence of human biology and culture.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Nine monkeys were tested for adult lactase activity; seven owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus), one bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata), and one rhesus monkey {Macaca

midalla). All specimens were certified to be in good health at the time of sacrifice by the contributing research centers. The seven owl monkeys came from the animal colony of the University of California at Los Angeles, and the two macaques from the Center for Primate Biology at the University of California at Davis. The small intestines were excised at death, packed immediately in dry ice and shipped air express to the Laboratory of Physical Anthropology at Idaho State University. The specimens were placed in deep freeze at --60° Centigrade until tested. The owl and bonnet monkeys were kept for four weeks at this temperature. It had been hoped that more specimens would be forthcoming. The above eight specimens were run as one group, and the ninth, the rhesus, obtained at a much later date, tested independently. The rhesus specimen was kept at --60° for two weeks.
The mucosal layer of each specimen was washed with PBS, then scraped, and the wet weight taken before placing in 10 ml. of PBS. Break-up of the cells was accomplished by alternate freezing and thawing, three times. The method of Dahlquist (1964) was followed in the assay of lactase activity (see Table 1). The lactose substrate was prepared at 0.056

Molar concentration in 0.1 Molar maleate buffer at a pH of 6.0. Then 0.1 ml. of each specimen was tested without further dilution as the expectation was that the lactase activity would be low. The disaccharidase activity of the preparation analyzed is given by the following formula of Dahlquist 1964:
Disaccharidase activity (units/ml)
_(a -- b)'d
~ n · 540
where a = amount of glucose (micrograms) found in the aliquot of the incubated sample, b = amount of glucose found in the corresponding blank, d = dilution factor of the enzyme solution used for mixing with the substrate, and n = number of glucose molecules that are liberated per substrate (disaccharide) molecule hydrolyzed. For lactose which contains one molecule of glucose and one of galactose, n=l.
RESULTS
Normal and abnormal lactase levels in man have been described by Ferguson and Maxwell (1967) who state that values below 1.0 unit per gram mucosa are definitely abnormal, and 1.0 to 1.4 units are borderline. Knudsen et al. (1968), describing normal and abnormal values as above and below 1.0 unit respectively, use the same description of a unit as that of Ferguson and Maxwell (1967); one unit is one micromole of substrate hydrolyzed per minute per gram of wet weight of tissue. Both the above papers say they used Dahlquist's method in which the incubation time is one hour and not intervals thereof. To express results in terms of "substrate hydrolyzed per minute" would necessitate fractional incubation to know the precise end-point. Hence, the lactase activity values in these two papers should

be much higher if given for the incubation time of one hour as described in Dahlquist's technique. This makes the low values obtained in this study even more significant. The range of activity obtained was from 0.07 to 0.74, indicative of lactase deficiency.
Specimens one through eight were kept for four weeks at --60° Centigrade. Could enzyme activity have taken place in that time? Reiner and Patterson (1966) say that enzyme activity is not modified by freezing. Cain et al. (1969) state they had previously determined that enzymes did not change when kept in a deep freeze over a period of weeks.
CONCLUSIONS
Lactase activity in the bonnet, owl, and rhesus monkeys were low, ranging from 0.07 to 0.74 units of activity. The smallness of the sample, only one specimen each for two species, make the deductions claimed earlier, that nonhuman primates as a group are lactase deficient, only suggestive at best.
For the present, it would appear that the findings do suport McCracken's theory (1970) that the high rates of adult lactase sufficiency are due to selective pressures created by the introduction of lactose into the diet following the adoption of dairy technology. If culture has acted as a selective milieu for natural selection, this most modest study when expanded could serve as an example and point the way to similar examples, particularly in those areas dealing with the relationships between diet, culture, and selection and those between disease, culture, and selection.
Gilat et al. (1970) have offered some findings that are inexplicable in light of what is known about the long period of the European base of the Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. They admit this was a hospital population and not a random

population sample and that Jewish groups in the United States and elsewhere should be sampled.
Baker (1966) offers two perspectives of study on the problem of variability in human population genetic structure and their adaptive significance. The second perspective, the demonstrable adaptive value of specific genetic variation in man, would appear to summarize the implications of this study. A new food source appears and those individuals in a population who by their genetic endowment can avail themselves of this new item apparently do so. Selection for this gene would be intense, and over the thousands of intervening

years one could expect a rapid rise in the
incidence of this gene.
