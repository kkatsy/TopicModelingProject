ABSTRACT: Cerebellar Purkinje neurons of long-sleep (LS) mice express a higher sensitivity than do those of short-sleep (SS) mice to the depressant effects of ethanol in situ, in vitro, and in intraocular cerebellar brain grafts. The ethanol sensitivity of Purkinje neurons is intrinsic to the cerebellum, may be associated with only certain brain areas, and shows a high genetic correlation with the behavioral sensitivity of mice to ethanol-induced ataxia. Tolerance develops to the depressant effects of ethanol on cerebellar neurons in both lines of mice. However, ethanoltolerant LS mice are more sensitive to the electrophysiological effects of ethanol on Purkinje neurons than are ethanol-tolerant SS mice. In addition, the behavioral sensitivity to this drug probably also involves noncerebellar neurons since neonatally cerebellectomized LS and SS mice retain a different sensitivity to the ataxic effects of ethanol.

The heterogeneous stock of mice (HS), from which the LS and SS mice were selectively bred, expressed Purkinje neuron sensitivities to ethanol

which were intermediate to those found for LS and SS mice. This differential neuronal sensitivity to ethanol in LS and SS mice is apparently brain region specific since Sorensen and colleagues (1981) reported that no differences existed between LS and SS mice in terms

Fio. 3.--Effects of superfusion of 300 mM ethanol on the size of the pyramidal neuron population spike evoked by stimulation of Schaffer-commissural afférents in the in vitro hippocampal slice. Curves show mean normalized spike amplitude with S.E.M. displayed for every fourth point. Stimuli were pairs of shocks at 5-sec intervals delivered once per minute. Typical responses during control and ethanol perfusion are inset in the lower right portion of the figure. The first deflection is the stimulus artifact; the negatively sloping (downward) part of the waveform with the roughly 5 msec latency to onset is the population spike. This spike represents the simultaneous firing of a population of pyramidal neurons in the vicinity of the electrode in response to stimulation of the afferent pathway. The size of the spike represents the number of neurons responding to the stimulation. There were no significant differences in the effects of ethanol for decreasing population spike size between LS and SS mice. (From Sorensen et al., 1981, Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 14, p. 232.

experiments described above probably directly affects cerebellar neurons in the vicinity of the pipette tip. However, ethanol applied by this method might also alter the activity of nearby nerve terminals from other brain areas. Previous investigations illustrate that ethanol's effects on input pathways to the cerebellum may mediate some of the changes in Purkinje neuron firing rates caused by systemic administration of this depressant drug (Rogers et al.,

1980; Siggins and Bloom, 1980; Sinclair andLo, 1980,1981). On the other hand, a direct action of ethanol in the cerebellum is evident from the work of Forney and Klemm (1976) who reported that the electrophysiological effects of systemic ethanol persist in cerebella which have been surgically isolated from the rest of the brain. In addition, ethanol perfused in vitroalters the firing rates of neurons in expiants of cerebellum (Seil et al., 1977).

nization typical of the in situ cerebellum (Palmer et al., 1982). We observed dose-dependent depressions of Purkinje neuron firing rates with ethanol perfusion of in oculo cerebellar grafts derived from both LS and SS mice (Fig. 4). Purkinje neurons from LS grafts were about an order of magnitude more sensitive to the depressant effects of perfused ethanol than were Purkinje cells from SS grafts (Fig. 5).

Consistent with this hypothesis that genotypic differences between Purkinje neurons from LS and SS lines of mice determine the cerebellar ethanol sensitivities of these animals, Basile and collaborators (1983) have reported that Purkinje neurons from slices of LS cerebella are 5-fold more sensitive to the depressant effects of ethanol perfused in vitrothan are neurons from slices of SS cerebella (Fig. 7). Similar to the in situ

Since the in oculo transplants do not receive nerve terminals from the central nervous system (CNS), the observed ethanol sensitivity difference could not be due to alterations of central afferent nerve fibers. However, effects of ethanol on axons from the host iris, which are known to innervate cerebellar grafts in oculo (Taylor et al., 1980), cannot be ruled out. We also found that the ethanol sensitivity of Purkinje cells is not altered in cerebellar grafts transplanted between mouse lines (Fig. 5). Thus, Purkinje neurons in grafts derived from LS fetal brain and transplanted to SS host mice exhibited ethanol sensitivities (Fig. 6) similar to that of neurons from

data, the ethanol sensitivity of HS Purkinje neurons is intermediate between that of LS and SS cerebellar slices. Since many of the afférents to the cerebellum have been truncated from their cell bodies in the preparation of the in vitro cerebellar slice, there is little if any spontaneous synaptic activity in this preparation. Thus, although the longterm modulation of Purkinje cell responsiveness to ethanol by neuronal inputs to the cerebellum cannot be discounted from these experiments, the physiological effects of ethanol found during this in vitro study may reflect direct actions of ethanol in the cerebellum.

bution. This, however, is consistent with the fact that the selected lines have been bred at least twenty generations for a specific combination of gene complexes that express the extreme phenotypic responses in ethanol sensitivity. The inbred strains, on the other hand, have had no selection pressure applied for ethanol's effects during their breeding histories. Indeed, the observed distribution of ethanol sensitivities might be expected for the inbred strains if the fixation of gene complexes for ethanol

sensitivity within the strains during their development was a chance event, consistent with random genetic drift.
From the analysis of covariance, the estimate of genetic correlation of ethanol sleep time and Purkinje neuron ethanol sensitivity was quite high; this suggests that either common genes or closely linked genes influence both behavioral and neuronal sensitivities to this depressant agent. Further experiments, using recombinant inbred strains (Bailey, 1971; Eleftheriou and Elias,
