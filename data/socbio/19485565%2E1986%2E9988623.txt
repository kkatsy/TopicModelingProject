ABSTRACT: The fertility of the Hutterites has become almost legendary in the demographic literature. Coale selected their overall total fertility rate (equal to 10.9) as the standard for his index of marital fertility (Coale, 1965). The rate is very commonly used as a benchmark for "natural fertility"; that is, as an indicator of how high human procreation can be under favorable environmental conditions and with no deliberate controls.
The present note takes off from the interesting but unexplored fact that while the Hutterite TFR of 10.9 is high relative to most other extant populations, this rate does not, in fact, represent a maximum biological potential TFR. In other words, some controls do seem to be at work even among the Hutterites. The purpose of this exercise is two-fold: (1) We estimate a modified figure for what Hutterite fertility could be under a truly unconstrained regime and present a revised age pattern of that fertility; (2) We compare this modified Hutterite age-specific fertilityrate pattern to the "natural fertility" age-specific fertility-rate pattern and look at some broader implications.

aged 35-49 were currently married, widowhood seems unimportant as a factor in fertility per ever-married women.
About 5per cent of the total births recalled by the women were children reported to have died before reaching their first birthday. This is a relatively high figure but covers, it should be recalled, pregnancies going back several decades before 1950, the date of the first survey. It was also reported that most deliveries took place at home with only a midwife in attention. Pregnancy wastage (fetal deaths due to spontaneous abortions and miscarriage) was reported (in a later follow-up study) to be about 10 per cent of all pregnancies. Women typically nursed their infants, but some dietary supplements were usually introduced after six months and most infants were weaned by the end of their first year.
Coital frequency was estimated at 2.5 per week for young couples, and there was evidence that it declined with family size and age. Separation of couples, even temporarily, was thought to be rare. There was no positive injunction to lead couples to continue to pursue maximum fertility, and abstinence was not looked upon as a "sin." Young couples who remained childless were an oddity attracting solicitude or curiosity. However, couples who, having six or eight children, had no more, were not viewed as strange. The Eaton and Mayer study found some clinical evidence that a substantial number of women over 35 had been surgically sterilized, as a result of hysterectomies and other abdominal operations.
Table 1 presents the Hutterite marital age-specific fertility rates. Focusing on the completed family size of females aged 45-49, we find a total fertility rate (TFR) of 10.9. (Lower figures are

yielded for females aged 50-54 and over, but recall problems are common in such data, particularly when some of the children have died.) It is this TFR of nearly 11which has established the Hutterites' place in the demographic literature.
The Hutterite TFR and the agespecific rates underlying it are usually presented as an illustration of how high fertility can be when a population is healthy, stable, and noncontracepting. Could it be higher still? In their original work, Eaton and Mayer addressed the question of what Hutterite fertility could be if all females married early and were never widowed, thus gaining additional exposure time. They estimated rather roughly that completed family size (total fertility) could be increased by between 1and 3 births, to between 12 and 14 births per woman.

amined the Hutterite data in depth. The birth intervals by parity resulting from the fertility rates derived by Sheps are shown in Table 2. The pattern shows a gradual increase in the mean birth interval from 19 months for Parity 2 to 25 months for Parity 14, an increase of roughly half a month per additional birth. What explains this increase in mean interval?
(a) The mean time from marriage to first birth is about 14 months, resulting in an estimate of 5 months "waiting time" to conceive (since there is no premarital pregnancy). This can be taken to be the minimum "waiting time" needed to conceive for higher parities as well. (b) There is a normal period of postpartum amenorrhea (and infecundity) of several months, (c) Fetal wastage lengthens the mean intervals, and Sheps, after adjusting the reported rates of fetal wastage in this population, sets this effect as one month added per mean interval. Both these last two factors are probably age-parity connected and would be more important for higher parity births than lower parity ones (Leridon, 1977; Henry, 1972; Bongaarts, 1975; Gorsh and Wolfers, 1979; Pearl, 1936). Thus, we assume that postpartum amenorrhea varies from 1 to 3 months between Parities 2 and 14; and that the fetal wastage effect varies from 0 to 2 months over the same parity range, (d) Lactation affects the length of post-partum amenorrhea. If, following Bongaarts' (1978) estimate, we allow roughly one month of "protection" per two months of intense lactation, then six months of breast-feeding creates three months of post-partum amenorrhea. This period overlaps the normal period of post-partum amenorrhea and thus adds a net period of protection from two months for Parity 2 to zero months for

Parity 14. (This lactation effect is modest enough to warrant ignoring the possible effect of infant mortality in reducing the average lactational period.)
What remains, then, is the "unexplained" increase in mean birth interval as parity increases, after all these factors (usual waiting time to conceive, postpartum amenorrhea, fetal wastage and lactation) have been taken into account. This period is two months for Parity 2, rising to six months for Parity 7 and remaining constant through Parity 14. Table 2 presents the numerical outcome of this exercise.
BIRTH INTERVALS BY AGE OF MOTHER
These data on mean interval by parity can be converted into mean interval by age, the intervals resulting from the age-specific marital fertility rate presented in Table 1. These are shown in Table 3. They also show a gradual increase up to age groups 40-44 where the fertility rate falls sharply and the intervals rise abruptly. If we focus on the first four mean intervals of the Hutterite agespecific fertility span, we can attempt the same kind of decomposition of the mean interval undertaken above by parity. As may be seen in Table 3, age group 20-24 produced 2.8 births, and a mean interval of 21 months. If we assume (a) a nine-month pregnancy, (b) one month of normal post-partum amenorrhea, (c) three months of lactational amenorrhea, (d) a normal waiting time of five months, then we have accounted for 18 months. The same logic underlies the calculation of the estimated minimum intervals for agegroups 25-29 and above.

EXPLANATORY FACTORS
What remains when all these factors are allowed for is the "unexplained" residual. For age group 20-24 this can perhaps be due to a slightly longer amenorrheal period (normal plus lactational), or higher fetal wastage, or variation in the normal waiting time, or some combination of all these factors. However, for the age groups 25-29,30-34, and 3539, slight changes in these explanatory factors will not suffice to explain the increasing unexplained portion of the interval. What other factors can explain this increase in mean birth interval with age? Only two factors would appear to remain: (a) declining fecundability with age; (b) contraception, including sterilization and reduced coital frequency.
The issue of what exactly is meant (or ought to be meant) by "declining fecundability" is a complex one.2 As noted, primary sterility among Hutterite women seems low (3 per cent of the married women aged 35-39 had no children). Sterility does increase with age (Pittinger, 1973),3 and this must also be allowed for. But Sheps (1965) found no
2Peluso (1976, p. 35) writes: "The reduced reproductive capacity associated with increasing maternal age is. . . . a result of increased incidence of spontaneous abortions and congenital malformations. . . ." This is consistent with the growing evidence that many early miscarriages escape notice (Sheps, 1965, p. 112). As a result, the distinction between fecundability and fetal wastage is almost impossible to draw.
3But, Henry (1972, p. 19) writes: "From available information on the mean interval between marriage and birth by the woman's age, there does not appear to be a reduction with increasing age. . . ." Charbonneau (1975, p. 208) puts the same point even more clearly: "Retenons pour l'instant qu'entre 17 ans et 40 ans, c'est-a-dire durant la plus grande partie de la vie feconde des femmes, I'dge de la femme considere isolement n'a pas d'infiuence sur la fecondite des couples fertiles." Thus, what is called declining fecundability may well be a composite of many forces.

evidence of a particularly sharp decline in fecundability with age among the Hutterites. Hence, the average incidence by age of sterility (for European populations) presented by Henry (1961) is perhaps a reasonable estimate of the incidence of sterility by age for the Hutterites. Interpolating between the benchmark estimates Henry gives for ages 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40, we estimate the following increments to the mean birth interval for all women of a given age group by reason of the fact that a growing proportion of their number are sterile and consequently not making any contribution to the flow of births:
Ages 20-24--1.0 months Ages 25-29--2.0 months Ages 30-34--3.0 months Ages 35-39--4.0 months Ages 40-44--10.0 months
If we make this adjustment to the estimated interval of Table 3, the results are as shown in Table 4.
The unexplained discrepancies between the estimated mean intervals and the observed intervals are reduced but not eliminated. We are, therefore, forced to conclude that some other fertility-inhibiting control was at work in the Hutterite population and that this

control was age-parity connected. Thus, there is this analytical evidence to go with the qualitative empirical evidence reported by Eaton and Mayer (1954) that some age- and parity-connected controls seemed to be present in this natural fertility population. Eaton and Mayer (1954) suggested some sterilization and also declining coital frequency as the principal such controls.
THE POTENTIAL "FULL FERTILITY" OF THE HUTTERITES
Accepting these adjusted minimum birth intervals of Table 3, we can also calculate the maximum potential "full fertility" of the Hutterites were these estimated minimum intervals attained. These are shown in Table 5. They represent, to repeat, the estimated mean birth intervals by age group allowing for (a) pregnancy itself, (6) postpartum amenorrhea, (c) fetal losses; (d) normal waiting time, and (e) increasing sterility.

The resulting age-specific rate and the total fertility rate implied can be called the "full fertility" of the Hutterites. They represent a total fertility rate of about 15, a figure which is in line with other analytically-based estimates of maximum fertility (Bongaarts, 1978). Indeed, since the original Hutterite study, Charbonneau has reported on a historical French Canadian population with a total fertility rate nearly this high (Charbonneau, 1975).
CONCLUSIONS ON HUTTERITE FERTILITY
Thus, the proper conclusion about Hutterite fertility should perhaps be that a population which marries relatively late and has some lactational amenorrhea and some high-parityconnected birth-preventing practices can produce 11 live births per married female. Were this population to marry early, have no lactational amenorrhea, and no sterilization or parity-connected decline in coitus, then the observed mean birth intervals would be reduced slightly, and the total fertility rate would be about 15.0 per woman. The "natural fertility" of the Hutterites is still well below what may be called to borrow Henripin's phrase (1954), the potential "full fertility."
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE NATURAL FERTILITY MODEL
Let us conclude by comparing this "full fertility" to the familiar "natural fertility" as defined by Henry and formalized by Coale and Trussell (1974). The Coale-Trussell "natural fertility" model describes the following situation:
Er(a) = MEn(a)

in which
a is a given age group (20-24 to 40-45),
n(a) is the "natural fertility" rate, r(a) is the expected fertility rate for
the given population, M is a scale factor equal to the ra-
tio of r(a) to n(a) for age group 20-24, m is the index of "control," v(a) is the empirically derived "natural fertility" function value for the given age group.
The proportion of the female population married (or otherwise in union) and the environmental and societal factors affect only M. Where no contraception is practiced, m = 0 and the age pattern of fertility corresponds to the natural fertility pattern. Coale has developed at some length in earlier works (Coale, 1971) the importance of differences in proportion married in explaining changes in total fertility over time. However, these changes in marriage patterns do not seem to affect very much the agespecific pattern of fertility within marriage. Hence, the M factor is simply a scalar which raises or lowers the curve but does not affect its shape. The natural fertility model also assumes that the environmental-societal factors can be treated the same way. They affect total fertility evenly across the fecund agespan; that is, they affect average birth interval, are not parity connected, and do not represent conscious "control." Control occurs (m>0) when the shape of the actual fertility curve differs from the shape of the natural fertility curve. Indeed, such a difference is prima facia evidence of the existence of contraception in this model.
"Natural fertility" is subject to variation in real populations. D'Souza (1974)

writes, for example: "The existence of differences in levels of natural fertility is well known." He derives "standardized" parameters for the major components involved in the closed birth intervals (ages 20-45). He notes:
In a non-contraceptive situation of very low foetal wastage . . . the 5 [standardized] mean time to conceive a live birth would perhaps be close enough to the actual mean time to conception of a live birth. But, even in this case the two are not the same, since many imponderables are present in a concrete situation, like frequency of intercourse, taboos, absences, sickness, etc., all of which are included in Henry's definition of 'natural fertility'. . . .If we include the possibility of high foetal wastage . . . the situation becomes more complex. Not only do we have in this case an increase in the mean time to conception of a live birth, but also . . . because of incomplete gestation . . . the month or so after miscarriage before the woman becomes fecundable again (pp. 117-118).
In a similar vein, Potter (1979) has proposed three separate "natural fertility" standards, according to the level of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and lactational practice. For age group 2024 these vary from the "high" fertility mean interval of 20 months to a "low" fertility mean interval of 34 months. His "intermediate" fertility interval of 27 months coincides with the Coale-Trusell (1974) natural fertility schedule.
Evidently several levels of "natural fertility" can be denned depending upon the force of: (a) lactational amenorrhea; (b) fetal wastage; (c) factors affecting cohabitation and frequency of intercourse. A useful analytical step would appear to be served by defining the maximum "full fertility" potential which would be reached in any population when such controls are minimal or ab-

sent altogether. This our "full fertility" curve does.
In Figure 1 we plot the estimated Hutterite "full fertility" curve (the solid line) against the "natural fertility" curve of Coale and Trussell (1974) (the dotted line) and show both as normalized rates (adding to 100). The Coale and Trussell rates are an average of 7 of Henry's "natural fertility" populations, including the Huttentes. Both of the schedules plotted are empirically based but both are also, in a sense, "models" or constructs. (The data are shown in Table 6.)
The fact that our "full fertility" model curve is above the "natural fertility" model is not surprising. We have removed the various controls present even in the "natural fertility" setting, and this leads to the difference between TFR = 15.0 and TFR = 11.0. But what explains the difference in the shape of our "full fertility" schedule and the Coale-Trussell "natural fertility" schedule?
The answer lies in the assumption made by Henry and accepted by Coale and Trussell that none of the controls present in a natural fertility situation are parity-connected. In other words, they assume that removing all such controls would change the level but not the shape of their curve. Our analytical exercise casts doubt on the validity of this assumption.
At one point Coale and Trussell write of "the gradual decline with age characteristic of natural fertility" (Coale and Trussell, 1974, p. 190), but do not elaborate on why this decline occurs. Our results suggest that increasing sterility, fetal losses, and other physiological factors are insufficient to explain the sharp age-parity-connected decline in fertility shown by their curve. What is left are the "other" controls, societal and indi-

vidual, which are always present even in a "natural fertility" setting. These other factors include the numerous customs, taboos, and behavior patterns, most of which end up affecting coital frequency (Davis and Blake, 1959; Henry, 1961). Coital frequency becomes the only plausible parity-connected control in a natural fertility setting.
Coital frequency evidently does decline with age, although we know very little about why (Pearl, 1936; Tietze, 1960). Possible explanations are: declining libido (male and/or female); increased separation of spouses; increased morbidity and infirmity of one partner; and a desire to have no more children, either because of taboos on births past a certain life cycle point (the birth of one's grandchildren) or individual choice. Coital frequency may or may not be a deliberate birth-preventing practice. Clearly, it is a relatively complex variable and an almost completely neglected one. Both societal and individual preferences regarding fertility are involved.
One final point can be made. It is not clear why all other controls, including coital frequency, should be parityneutral. The natural fertility model operates with an implicit theory of fertility which says that couples in high-fertility populations may use "spacing" tactics but not "stopping" tactics, and that societal controls, if present, also work this way. Yet there is considerable empirical support for thinking that some threshold of family size does exist for most couples which triggers efforts to reduce subsequent fertility. Under such conditions, whatever "stopping" procedures are available will be used in a parityconnected way. Indeed, it has long been accepted that much of the decline in fer-

tility in the Western "transition" was based on "folk" not "appliance" methods of contraception (abstinence and withdrawal included) and began to occur very early (Stix, 1940; Nag, 1980). Many of the societal rules and taboos discussed by Henry clearly also can be seen as "stopping" procedures.
Our conclusion is that the declining age-specific "natural fertility" curve must be seen as a composite result of partly physiological elements but also partly behavioral factors. The "natural fertility" model assumes that these behavioral factors, including declining coital frequency, are parity-neutral but the results of our analytical exercise question this.
In criticizing some recent writers who propose explaining all presently unexplained variation in fertility as due to nutrition, Menken wrote:
To probe more deeply into the underlying causes of differences in fertility becomes far more difficult. . . . Evidence on frequency of intercourse as well as other factors which may prolong time to conception is undoubtedly difficult to obtain. . . . Yet to accept nutrition as the primary explanation of fertility differences simply because the truth is difficult (or perhaps impossible) to discover is a retreat to adoption of a simplistic hypothesis . . . (Menken, et al., 1980, p. 441).
Can the same not be said of "declining biological fecundability"? This would seem to be an important issue in future fertility research.
