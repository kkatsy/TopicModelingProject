deficiencies in his excursions into genetics. Neither does the formula ensure that the

value of heritability will be less than 1.

JENSEN'S INDEX OF HERITABILITY
Jensen (1967) criticizes Holzinger's and Nichol's index and gives his own index for measuring heritability as (rMZ --rDZ)/(l-- p00), where rm = phenotypic correlation between monozygotic twins, rDZ = phenotypic correlation between dizygotic twins, andp00 = genetic correlation between sibs. He gives no proof that his index measures heritability as defined genetically. The

Jensen's index using the above formula for p00 can be written as (rm - r^) (2 + p00). If we take xm = 1, rDZ = 0.5, which Jensen also takes, heritability will always be greater than 1 if the population is mating assortatively. Note that Jensen's estimate of heritability, presumably broad heritability, of IQ as 0.8 is based on this formula (Jensen, 1967).
PARENT-CHILD CORRELATION

formula contains p00, the genetic correlation between sibs which can not be mea-
sured directly. He suggests that p0O should be obtained from the formula p00 = (1 + PPP)/(2 + Ppp), where ppp is the genetic correlation between mates, and gives Li

Jensen (1969, p. 46) says, "The genetic

theoretically produce (rP5) is the same value asHN, i.e., heritability in the narrow sense." He does not say whether the relation rgo = y/îÇ, holds for a population mating at random or for one mating assortatively. In any case, it does not appear to be correct.

It would therefore appear that Jensen's formula is not correct.

Fisher (1918) shows that for a population mating at random the covariance between parent and child, in Fisher's notation, is Jj82 for one factor. Summing over all factors, the covariance will be \VA where VA is the additive variance. Midparent and child covariance will be the same. Assuming equilibrium, the variance of the children will be the same as that of parents. Therefore,

SIB CORRELATION
Jensen (1969, p. 46) says, "The correlation is also between .50 and .60 for siblings on these characteristics; sibling resemblance is generally much higher than this for traits of low heritability." It needs to be stated clearly that low heritability is not the cause of high correlation between sibs and that low heritability in itself would not suggest a high sib correlation. If

"on

a trait with low heritability and high sib correlation could be found, the likely ex-

model could be used in such a situation.
Jensen (1973, p. 108), says, "the theoretical genetic correlation crG; [presumably a misprint for pG] between siblings (when there is no genetic correlation between their parents) is 0.50. If the parents have some degree of genetic resemblance, the correlation between siblings will be

slightly greater than 0.50." On page 112 he

In this passage he probably wanted to say "only in the absence of assortative mating" in place of "only under assortative mating."

lowest heritability are those most closely connected with reproductive fitness, while the characters with the highest heritabilities are those that might be judged on biological grounds to be the least important as determinants of natural fitness."
