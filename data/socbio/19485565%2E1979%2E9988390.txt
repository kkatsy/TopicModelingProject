ABSTRACT: Demographers have frequently suggested that women's fecundability reaches a maximum some time in their twenties and thereafter remains at a plateau for some years. Recent work by Bendel and Hua(1978) reinforces theauthor's previously expressed suspicion that this theory is incorrect. The present note isaneffort tosynthesize current knowledge about thevariation withage of the reproductive parameters underlying fecundability. It is suggested (1) that themajor causeof the decline in fecundability across ages 20-40 isa decline in coital rates, and (2)that a smaller part of the decline in fecundability iscaused bya rise in risk of unrecognized spontaneous abortion. Itis concluded that the "biological capacity to conceive" does notvary much during ages 20-40.

pt, THE PROBABILITY THAT OVULATION OCCURS

p2, THE PROBABILITY THAT COITUS OCCURS IN THE FERTILE PERIOD

The mean age at menarche is about 13 years. About 55 per cent of all menstrual cycles in the first menstrual year are ovulatory. For each successive year, the proportion of cycles estimated to be ovulatory increases roughly linearly until about 97 per cent of all cycles are ovulatory at age 23. The proportion remains roughly constant until about age 40 when it starts declining to about 50 per cent just before menopause (Treloar, 1974). These variations in p¡ suggest that at least part of the rise of fecundability with age before 20 is due to a concomitant increase in/?,.
In estimating the trend of fecundability after age 20, Bendel and Hua (1978) use data from two sources: their age-specific fertility data are from Hutterite women (Tietze, 1957), and their estimates of age of onset of natural sterility are based on Treloar's data (1974) on menopause. But one may wonder whether Hutterite women in general reach menopause as late as the women in Treloar's sample (1974). The ground for this suspicion is as follows. MacMahon and Worcester (1966) found a slight negative association between age at menopause and parity. This is odd because if the two variables were causally unrelated, then one would expect a positive association between them simply because if (by chance) a woman were to undergo menopause early, then she could not bear as many children as she otherwise

The event of ovulation may be thought of as contained within a stretch of time (called the "fertile period") during which coitus is attended with a nonzero probability of conception. This stretch of time is equal to the sum of the durations of viability of ovum and sperm, less any time required for capacitation. Capacitation is the phenomenon whereby a sperm is unable to fertilize an ovum until it has been in the female reproductive tract for some hours. Capacitation in the human being is thought to last about 6 hours (Edwards et al., 1969; Hembree, 1977). The fertile period in the human being has been estimated as of the order of two days (James, 1978a). If it is of this magnitude, then the probability that coitus occurs in the fertile period is approximately directly proportional to the coital rate (James, 1965). And it is well established that mean marital coital rates decline roughly linearly from age 20 to age 40, being only about half at age 40 what they were at age 20 (Kinsey et al., 1953;Westoff and Westoff, 1971; Gorer, 1971).

This is a parameter about which little is known in general, let alone its possible variation with age. However, it has been estimated at 0.9 in the pig (Corner, 1923),

and a similar value has been suggested, on tenuous evidence for the human being (James, 1970). In this context, Hertig (1967) raises the question of whether "at least in the human, the oocyte always gets into the Fallopian tube following ovulation. . . . It seems unlikely that so complicated a process should always work perfectly every time." At this juncture, one might note that if such high estimates of (mean) /?3 are correct, then p3 cannot vary greatly with age.
p4, THE PROBABILITY THAT UNRECOGNIZED
SPONTANEOUS ABORTION DOES NOT OCCUR

mately directly proportional to coital rate, other parameters held constant (James, 1965). Of the two relevant parameters, one (p,, the ovulation rate) remains roughly constant, and the other (p4, the complement of the unrecognized spontaneous abortion rate) almost certainly declines. So it seems that the slightly greater decline in fecundability than in coital rate across the age range 20-40 may be explained by the probable rise in risk of unrecognized spontaneous abortion. Thus, it seems to follow that p3 cannot vary much across those years.

It is well established that recognized spontaneous abortion rates are higher at advanced maternal ages. However, interpretation of this increase is less secure, (see Naylor, 1974, and James, 1977, for different interpretations). But it seems likely that sibships are heterogeneous, some showing an increasing risk and others a decreasing risk with age or parity (James 19786). What can be said in respect to unrecognized spontaneous abortion? It seems that early (short gestation) recognized spontaneous abortions are more likely than late spontaneous abortions to be associated with chromosomal anomaly, and in particular trisomy (Boue et al., 1976). As such, they would be expected to be more closely associated with maternal age than are later spontaneous abortions (James, 1974). So it seems reasonable to suspect unrecognized spontaneous abortions of being positively associated with maternal age.
We are now in a position to assess how p3 may vary with age. The facts seem to be that (1) mean fecundability at age 40 is about 0.4 of what it was at age 20, and (2) mean coital rate at age 40 is about half of what it was at age 20. Let us accept, as argued above, that in the human being the fertile period is relatively short (say, two days). Then fecundability is approxi-

DISCUSSION
Let us consider possible ways of testing the general suggestion made here that the main determinant of the decline in fecundability with age is the decline in coital rates. If this were true, then these three propositions would allow:
1. Conception waits would be inversely proportional to coital ra,tes.
2. Total fertility would be slightly but positively related to coital rate.
3. The fecundabilities of women with the same coital rate but different ages would not be greatly different (the difference being thought to be occasioned by an increase with age of unrecognized spontaneous abortion rates).
These propositions will be considered in turn.
Proposition 1.--The first proposition here is strongly supported by the data of Stix (1939), MacLeod and Gold (1953), and Westoff et al. (1963). Ryder and Westoff's (1971) data give moderate support to the proposition, and these authors were clearly surprised (p. 339) at the finding because they related current estimated coital rate to the conception waits through the entire reproductive histories of the respondents (some occurring twenty years previous). Workers finding a weaker (but still negative) association between coital

rate and conception wait were Stix and Notestein (1940) and Cartwright (1976).
In summary, all the data on this point are agreed that there is an association between coital rate and conception wait. Bearing in mind the very great imprecision in one of these variables (coital rate estimated for periods up to twenty years previous), we find it reasonable to infer that the true relationship between these variables is strong.
Proposition 2.--Sheps and Perrin (1964) have shown that the mean birth interval B is given by
where 62, 03, and 64 are the probabilities that a conception will result in a spontaneous abortion, a stillbirth, and a live birth, respectively; and -n, T]and T| are the means of the intervals during which a woman is not at risk of further conception (i.e., the gestation period plus the period of postpartum sterility) for a spontaneous abortion, a stillbirth, and a live birth, respectively; and p is harmonic mean fecundability.
If, following James (1965), we put
at 13 months, then harmonic mean fecundabilities of 0.5 and 0.1 (a five-fold change) would be associated respectively with birth intervals in the ratio of 14 and 22. Since fertility is proportional to the reciprocal of birth intervals, it follows that in conditions of natural fertility, couples whose harmonic mean fecundability is 0.1 would be expected to have about twothirds as many children as those whose harmonic mean fecundability was 0.5. Thus, even if variation in fecundability were entirely dependent on variation in coital rate, one would only expect a slight

association between coital rate and fertility. Nevertheless, two sets of data testify to such an association (Thompson and Illsley, 1969; James, 1974b). Thus, the evidence for this proposition is good also.
Proposition 3.--This proposition is supported by the data of Barrett (1971) who suggested that the fecundability of women over 30 is 70 per cent that of women less than 30 when coital rate is controlled. Moreover, this proposition is supported by a consideration of the Hutterite data presented by Sheps (1965). Her analysis shows that Hutterite cumulative duration-specific birth rates over the first ten years of marriage are almost identical for women married at ages 25-29, and at ages 20-24, and at ages less than 20.1 have unpublished data suggesting that coital rates (over the first years of marriage) are much more closely related to duration of marriage than to age. The inference is that these various classes of women, though they have different ages, have closely similar coital rates. And the fact that their fertilities (and hence fecundabilities) are equal strongly suggests that it is coital rate and not age per se which is responsible for the overall decline in fecundability with age.
The question arises: Would these propositions be true if coital rate were not a major determinant of fecundability? The third proposition would not be true, so no further discussion is required on that point. What of the first two? In principle they would be true, but in practice it seems that their truth would have remained undetected. As argued above, the relationship between fecundability and fertility is tenuous even in noncontracepting societies. Moreover, the relationship between one component of fecundability (coital rate) and fertility must be more tenuous still, and all the more so when that component is the subject of serious errors of measurement. The fact that these asso-
