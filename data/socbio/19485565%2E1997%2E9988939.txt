ABSTRACT: We conduct a cross-national study of contraceptive discontinuation among currently married nonsterilized contracepting women in Bolivia, Egypt, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Zimbabwe using the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). Since the DHS contains no true completed epochs of contraceptive use, the distribution of use times at survey is used to approximate the distribution of the completed epochs using the renewal theorem. Two techniques based on this approximation are used. The first technique uses local linear regression smoothing of a histogram estimate of the use time at survey pdf which is converted into an estimate of the discontinuation probability function. The second technique poses a proportional hazards Weibull distribution for the discontinuation probability function which is then converted into a model for the use times at survey. This second technique is used to model the observed variations in use across countries while controlling for other sociodemographic factors such as children ever born, age, and education, as well as a variable which encodes knowledge of the fertility cycle. Pill discontinuation probabilities range from 0.12 to 0.47 in the first year. IUD discontinuation probabilities range from 0.18 to 0.53 in the first year. Discontinuation probabilities in Egypt over all methods are in agreement with those reported in Ali and Cleland (1995). Logged relative risks of pill discontinuation range from -0.94 (Sri Lanka) to 0 (Kenya), while logged relative risks of IUD discontinuation range from -0.53 (Sri Lanka) to 0.41 (Zimbabwe). The ordering of risks of pill discontinuation among the six countries considered is in agreement with the ordering of total fertility rates excerpted from Westoff (1991).

In this paper we conduct a crossnational study of contraceptive discontinuation among currently married nonsterilized contracepting women in six developing countries using the Demographic and Health Surveys Phase I (DHS-I), and our results suggest that relative risks of pill discontinuation across countries rank in order corresponding to total fertility rates. The methods developed here are also of interest in their own right. Analyzing contraceptive use data for relative risks of discontinuation among subpopulations requires completed events, which means that the required unit of data per individual is the length of time of regular uninterrupted use

of a particular method of contraception from inception to discontinuation (stopping, getting pregnant, or switching to another method). This length of time we will call a completed event in what follows. The DHS-I contains duration of use of current method at survey in addition to length of use interior to the last two birth intervals, The duration of use at survey is not a cornpleted event, and the length of use interior to a birth interval, while being a completed event, suffers from selection (and recall) bias. Ali and Cleland (1995) use synthetic cohorts to conduct a life table analysis of contraceptive discontinuation by reason for stopping, although they did no covari-

ate analysis. Moreover, the generation of synthetic cohorts entails further potential for errors.
The duration of use of current method at a survey does not suffer from any of these difficulties and therefore is the most informative quantity with regards to contraceptive discontinuation in the DHS-I. With the gain in information comes a different challenge, however, since none of these observations constitutes a completed event. If we view the completed events as repeatable, and thus the observed duration of use of current method at survey as a backwards recurrence time (Allison, 1985; Cox 1962; Sheps and Menken, 1973), then we may use the tools of renewal theory to approximate the distribution (discontinuation probability) of the completed event from the observed backwards recurrence times (durations of use of current method at survey). We shall employ two variants of this technique. In the first, a descriptive analysis, we calculate first- and second-year discontinuation probabilities and mean use times from a smoothed histogram estimate of the pdf of the duration of use at survey divided by its intercept. In the second, a regression analysis, a proportional hazards Weibull model is posed on the unobserved completed events and then converted into a model for the durations of use at survey using the renewal theorem.
As mentioned above, the data for this study are from the DHS-I. The DHS-I, conducted by the Institute for Resource Development (IRD) between 1987 and 1993 in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, interviewed a nationally representative sample of women aged 15--49. For our analysis we selected six countries: Bolivia (IRD, 1989), Egypt (IRD, 1992),

Kenya (IRD, 1993), Sri Lanka (IRD, 1987), Thailand (IRD, 1987), and Zimbabwe (IRD, 1989). This study includes only nonsterilized, currently married women currently using a traditional method (periodic abstinence or withdrawal), the pill, IUD, injectable hormones, vaginal methods, or the condom.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Let Ti denote the completed duration of contraceptive use for the fth individual. Information on completed durations is not available in most countries in the Demographic and Health Surveys. However, information on backward recurrence time, e.g., the number of months up to the time of the survey that the respondent's current method has been in use, is available in the standard recode files employed in the present study (DHS, 1994). We denote this variable as Ut. In order to apply this method we must assume that conditional upon covariate values, the renewal intensity at survey time is approximately constant, which amounts to the following assumptions. As usual, we assume independence across individuals. Second, we must assume that the number of completed epochs of contraceptive use is large at the time of the survey (see Cox, 1962, and Sheps and Menken, 1973, for a discussion of renewal theory). These assumptions are necessary in order to ensure that a single completed interval, 7), for the i-th woman is representative of that woman's entire contraceptive use history and furthermore, that Ut actually contains information about T%.We may now define the population probability of discontinuation F(t\X) = P {T</|X} as the common marginal distribution of a completed interval of contraceptive use

conditional upon covariate values. It follows from these assumptions and the renewal theorem that the probability density function, g, of U (the observed backwards recurrence time) can be used to reasonably approximate the cumulative distribution function, F, of T (the unobserved completed event time) through the relationship:

, , ,, 1 - F(u\X) E(T\X)

(1)

F(y\X) = \ -

Also, by the linearization technique, we have the following pointwise estimated standard error of the discontinuation probability function (3a).

var[F(y)) =

(3b)

var\j<y)] _ 2g(y)vdr[§(y)] g(y)2var[g(O)]

We will discuss what is meant by "reasonable approximation" in the final section. This equation forms the basis of two indirect models for the discontinuation probability. The first model is descriptive and nonparametric in nature and is as follows. Given categorical response times, we form an estimate of the discontinuation probability by first forming a smoothed histogram estimate of g. For this we use the S-plus procedure, "loess" (local linear regression) applied to a simple histogram estimate of g with break points at the limits of resolution in the dataset, e.g., months (Cleveland, 1991). Next, from Equation (1) it can be seen that the reciprocal of the intercept of this smoothed histogram estimate may be used as a moment estimator of the mean since F(0) = 0.

E[T\X]=g(0\X)-

(2a)

By the standard linearization technique, we have the following estimate of the standard error of (2a).

The necessary pointwise standard errors of g-hat in formulas (3a) and (3b) above are obtained from the procedure "loess" which is used to smooth the histogram estimate of g. Notice that the covariance between g-hat at zero and g-hat at y (the second term in 3b) is estimated as the variance of g-hat at y which follows since the error function in the loess smoothing of g-hat has independent increments and g-hat equals zero with probability one at a prespecified time which is sufficiently large.
Our regression analysis is also based upon the concepts from renewal theory leading to Equation 1, and the methods used in deriving this second model are along the lines of Allison (1985) which we redevelop here. The choice of cumulative distributions F for T is constrained by the requirement of tractability of the resulting expression for the probability density g of U. Therefore, T is assumed to follow a proportional hazards Weibull model:

{2b) F(t\X) = 1 -

(4)

Continuing by substitution of (2a) into (1) our moment estimate of the discontinuation probability takes the form:

where a is the shape parameter, X is a vector of covariates, and p, the corresponding regression coefficients. The corresponding Weibull hazard is:

\(t\X) = ae^t"

Notice that the coefficients, p, of categorical variables have interpretation as the log of the relative risk for that category, while the shape parameter a explains whether hazard is increasing or decreasing with time by being, respectively, larger or smaller than one. Next we substitute (4) into (1) to obtain an expression for g. As is done in ordinary Weibull regression, we take the log of the response, Y= log U, to obtain the linear model.

RESULTS
First we discuss the estimated mean use times and first- and second-year discontinuation probabilities. These results are used to motivate the form of the linear predictor in the regression analysis which follows. In addition, the techniques of estimation (formulas 2a through 3b) may be considered as methods of analyzing backwards recurrence times which are alternative to the regression model (formulas 6 and 7) originally presented by Allison (1985).

times calculated from Equation (2a) and corresponding standard errors calculated from Equation (2b). There are differing patterns of method choice across the six countries. For example, traditional methods are used by 62 per cent of the women in Bolivia, and 16.9 per cent in Kenya but only by 6.8 per cent in Egypt. Injectable methods are used by 31.5 per cent of the women in Kenya, 33.3 per cent in Sri Lanka, and 17.5 per cent in Zimbabwe, but only by 3.7 per cent in Thailand. Condoms are used by 7.5 per cent of the women in Egypt and by 3.9 per cent in Kenya. Vaginal methods are not used in

appreciable number in any of the countries considered and thus are omitted from our analyses. The pill and IUD are used extensively in all countries and therefore will play an important role in our analysis. The most striking feature of mean use times by method is the high level of variation within each country across methods as well as within each method across countries. Mean use times for the pill range from 67 months (Sri Lanka) down to 19 months (Kenya) and are in the following order by country from highest to lowest: Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bolivia, Egypt, Zimbabwe, and

Kenya. Mean use times for the IUD range from 61 months (Sri Lanka) down to 16 months (Zimbabwe) and are in the following order by country from highest to lowest: Sri Lanka, Thailand, Kenya, Bolivia, Egypt, and Zimbabwe. Corresponding standard errors are small enough to warrant consideration of effects due to country and method type.
Next we turn attention to the estimated first- and second-year discontinuation probabilities which are displayed in Table 2. First-year discontinuation probabilities for oral contraceptives range from 0.12 (Bolivia) to 0.47 (Kenya) and are in the following order from lowest to highest: Bolivia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt, Zimbabwe, and Kenya. First-year discontinuation probabilities for the IUD range from 0.18 (Sri Lanka) to 0.53 (Zimbabwe) and are in the following order from lowest to highest: Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bolivia, Egypt, Kenya, and Zimbabwe. The first- and second-year discontinuation probabilities over all methods replicate the same order as the IUD for all countries except Kenya and Zimbabwe which are in the same order as the oral contraceptives. Notice from the samples sizes in Table 1 that pill and IUD use predominate over other methods in all countries and that among the two, IUD use is the more prevalent in all countries except Kenya and Zimbabwe, where oral contraceptive use is the more prevalent.
For purposes of comparison we provide in Table 3 first- and second-year discontinuation probabilities by method type for Egypt and Thailand calculated by AH and Cleland, 1995.' Comparison of the
1From Table 2, page 94, under the column with heading "All Causes" of that article.

"all methods" column with the results of Ali and Cleland (Table 3) shows good agreement in the case of Egypt, but substantial difference in the case of Thailand. The fact that our estimates give rise to an ordering which mimics that of total fertility rates (Table 5) suggest that our results in the case of Thailand are more accurate. ·
We now turn attention to the regression analysis. As discussed in the methods section, we use the "generalized gamma," specified in equations (6) and (7) to estimate relative risks of discontinuation and baseline hazard (shape parameter) from the logged times of use at survey. Because of small numbers in various cells relating to method use by country, we decided to merge the data from separate countries together, dummy-ing the countries as "B," "E," "S," "T," and "Z" with Kenya as the reference category. It is well known (Hammerslough, 1991) that sociodemographic factors such as age, parity, and level of education have a measurable effect upon contraceptive discontinuation. Several authors (Hadley, 1983, and Sheon et al., 1989) argue that while it is clear that good knowledge of the time of highest fertility in the menstrual cycle is necessary for successful usage of so-called natural family planning, such knowledge could enhance the user effectiveness of nonpermanent modern methods as well. Therefore, we incorporate factors of age, parity, education, residence, as well as knowledge of fertility cycle in our analyses of international comparison of lengths of use of varying methods of contraception. The model tests the effect of country on the risk of discontinuation while controlling for AGE, AGE2, children ever bom (CEB1: 0 to 1, reference: 2, CEB3: 3 to 4, CEB5: 5 or more), education (reference: none,

EDUC: primary, EDUC1: secondary or higher), residence (reference: rural, RES: urban) and knowledge of the fertility cycle (reference: no answer to question, KNO: incorrect answer to question, KN01: correct answer to question). Notice that AGE2 is included because it is an accepted phenomenon that the effects of age on discontinuation rates is nonlinear, due to the fact that women in their peak childbearing years tend to reduced discontinuation rates with advancing age, but this effect reverses as individuals pass through menopause.
From the combined dataset, five datasets (one for each method considered: TRAD, PILL, IUD, INJ, and COND) were extracted and, correspondingly, five regression models were fit. Only countries relevant for each method were included in the dataset corresponding to that method in the extraction from the merged file. Thus, TRAD consists of women from Bolivia and Kenya, INJ consists of women from Sri Lanka, Kenya, and Zimbabwe, and COND consists of women from Egypt and Kenya, while PILL and IUD consist of women from all six countries. The results of the regression analyses are displayed in Table 4. The regression coefficients obtained in fitting a proportional hazards model are of course the logged relative hazards of discontinuation and are displayed in Table 4.
Of the sociodemographic control variables considered, age and age-squared are highly significant in all models, with signs in agreement with the substantive issues discussed above: the coefficient of AGE is negative and that of AGE2 is positive. Parity is a highly significant determinant in the case of the IUD, in which women at parity zero or one have a much lower rate of discontinuation than the reference category of parity two. Education and residence are marginally to moderately signifi-

cant controlling factors, and correct knowledge of fertility cycle is only marginally significant in increasing the relative risk of discontinuing traditional method use. This phenomenon also has an accepted substantive explanation. Women using traditional methods correctly who know their fertility cycle will switch to conventional methods during times of peak fertility.
The main research hypothesis is a test of ordering relative risks by country. The results corresponding to users of the pill and IUD had the most significant effects by use of country, with ordering risk of discontinuation in good agreement with the results of the mean use times of Table 1 with the exception of the placement of Bolivia. Logged relative risks of pill discontinuation range from --0.93 (Sri Lanka) to 0 (Kenya), and are in the following order by country from lowest to highest: Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt, Bolivia, Zimbabwe, and Kenya. The gap between Thailand and Egypt and the-gap between Zimbabwe and Kenya are highly significant. Logged relative risks of IUD discontinuation range from -0.54 (Sri Lanka) to 0.41 (Zimbabwe) and are in the following order by country from lowest to highest: Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bolivia, Kenya, Egypt, and Zimbabwe. The gap between Kenya and Zimbabwe is marginally significant, the gap between Kenya and Bolivia is moderately significant, and the gap between Thailand and Sri Lanka is highly significant. Notice that the ordering of risks of pill discontinuation among the six countries considered is in agreement with the ordering of total fertility rates as reported in Table 5 which are excerpted from Westoff(1991).
The baseline hazard being modeled as a Weibull results in an additional parameter, that being the shape of the Weibull

DISCUSSION
We have seen in the last section how to use two methods in the analysis of back-

wards recurrence times of contraceptive use. The first method employs "loess" to smooth a histogram estimate of the backwards recurrence time density, which is then formed into a survival function estimate using Equation 1. Inherent in this approximation is a variant of the law of large numbers known as the renewal theorem (see any standard text on probability theory or renewal theory, for example, Cox, 1962). In order for this approximation to

be valid, there are two major conditions to check which we have here assumed to be upheld. Is the renewal intensity approximately constant? Have there been a large number of renewals (method stops) at survey? To get a feel for the performance of the smoothing technique, we display in Figure 1 the histogram estimate of the backwards recurrence time density, g, and overlay the results of the "loess" smoothing, g-hat. Notice that the smoothed histogram estimate is monotone decreasing (without having been constrained to be so), which is a good sign that the smoothed graph divided by its intercept could potentially approximate a survival function. In addition, the fact that our results are in agreement with the findings of an independent study (see Table 3) would seem to verify the validity of such an approach.
The other issue to be discussed is sample size. Recall that the orderings corresponding to pill and to IUD use obtained via the discontinuation probabilities versus those obtained via the regression analysis were for the most part in agreement. This finding suggests that a sample size of 200 is sufficient for this type of analysis. The exception to agreement in ordering was in the case Bolivia with a sample size of 31 pill users and 40 IUD users.
Another desirable facet of our method is that it requires no data imputation or synthetic cohort construction as is required in the methodology used by other authors (Ali and Cleland, 1995). Our substantive findings suggest that there are quite different patterns of use of the pill and of the IUD across the six countries considered here. The rank by risks of discontinuation partitions six countries into

groups of similar risk level. For the pill method, Kenya is in the high group, then Zimbabwe, Bolivia, and Egypt are in the middle group, and then Thailand and Sri Lanka are in the low group. For the IUD method we have four significantly different groups. Zimbabwe is the highest, followed by the Egypt/Kenya, followed by the Bolivia/Thailand group with Sri Lanka in the lowest group. Perhaps most interesting is that the relative risks of discontinuation for the pill rank the countries in exactly the same order as corresponding total fertility rates (Westoff, 1991).
CONCLUSION
In conclusion it must be stressed that the two forms of backwards recurrence time analysis used here are quite appropriate for analysis of contraceptive discontinuation rates using DHS data in that they do not require synthetic cohorts or data imputation, using instead the most accurate (on the basis of individual recall accuracy) information of duration of contraceptive use (that being the most recent). The fact that the methods agree with and may actually improve those of an independent study (Ali and Cleland, 1995) also adds support to this premise.
