Female Age at Marriage and the Birth Rate In India

Studies conducted in various parts of India have established an approximate, though not consistent, relationship between female age at marriage and completed family size. In the Mysore study (United Nations, 1961), it was observed that females marrying between the ages of 14 and 17 gave birth to 5.9 children, -while those marrying between 18 and 21 years eventually gave birth to only 4.7 children. A study in Calcutta among a middle-class urban population (Poti, Malaker, and Chakravorti 1960) showed that females marrying below age 14 gave birth to 6.3 children, those marrying between 15 and 19 gave birth to S.I children, and those marrying between 20 and 24 gave birth to only 3.7 children.
Similar relationships have also been observed in model studies conducted by demographers in different parts of the world. Using a stable population model, Coale and Tye (1961) demonstrated that postponement of marriage can contribute substantially to a reduction in birth rates and population growth. This contribution is potentially greatest in those countries which have high fertility and a low average age at marriage. William Leasure (1963) showed that when the mean age at marriage in Bolivia rose from 22.5 years to 27.2 years, the birth rate declined from 41 to 30, or by about 27%, and that in Turkey,

when the female mean age at marriage rose from 19.7 to 27.2 years, the birth rate declined from 50 to 33, or by about 34%.
In studies on the Indian birth rate, it has been estimated that when the female age at marriage is raised to nineteen or twenty years, the birth-rate reduction ranges from 16% to 50% (Agarwala, 1964, 1965). Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad (1967) observed that the decline in the birth rate would not be more than 10% by increasing the minimum age at marriage to nineteen to twenty years in India. Their findings have been criticized by Talwar (1967) who commented that their approach seemed to involve many questionable assumptions.
On the other hand, several studies conducted in India and elsewhere (Sinha, 1952) gave no evidence of any consistent relationship between age at marriage and completed family size. This may be due to differences in marriage cohorts associated with different socioeconomic, cultural, and ethnic characteristics.
Here an attempt has been made to study the effect of female age at marriage on the birth rate by considering a fixed marital fertility schedule for Indian females, unchanging over time irrespective of the marriage habits of the population. The object is to answer the simple question: If the marital fertility schedule continues to operate in its present form but female age at

marriage is increased, what will be the effect on population growth?
The effect on fertility of increasing the age at marriage of Indian women has been considered for four different values of mean age at marriage, namely, IS, 17, 19, and 21 years. The age at marriage of females for rural and urban India by states (Government of India, 1961) was critically examined by applying HajnaPs method (1953) over the marital distribution of females for all India. Table 1 gives those

age groups. Moreover, the pattern associated with the highest age at marriage exhibits an unusually high percentage of ultimate spinsters.
Regarding measures of fertility, three indices have been considered: (a) the crude birth rate (CBR); (b) the net reproduction rate assuming all marriages to be taking place at the singulate mean age at marriage (NRRi); and (c) the net reproduction rate using nuptiality tables (NRR2). Finally, a simple index, the total fertility rate (TFR), has been calculated.

tion seems to be insignificant. A similar result is obtained with other measures of fertility. It appears there is a critical level below which postponement of marriage will not reduce the fertility index (Das, 1965) to a significant extent. However, if the mean age at marriage changes from 15 to 19 years, the CBR falls by 1 1 % , the NRR by 9%, and the T F R by 10%, approximately. With an increase in mean age at

marriage of 6 years, from 15 to 21, the corresponding fertility reductions are 24%, 17%, and 17%, respectively. As observed by Talwar (1967), our study also reveals a larger percentage reduction of fertility, approximately on the order of 20%, when age at marriage increases from 15 to 21 years. These results are at variance with those obtained by Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad (1967).
