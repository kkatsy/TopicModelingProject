The Amish sect originated in 1693 in the canton of Berne, Switzerland, when followers of Jakob Ammann left the parent Swiss Brethren sect. Later dissensions led to the formation of several theologically related but more progressive groups also sometimes called Amish, so that for identification the original sect is properly known as "Old Order Amish." For brevity, however, the shorter generic term "Amish" will be used in this report. Religious and social aspects of Amish society are discussed elsewhere (McKusick, Hostetler, and Egeland, 1964; Hostetler, 1963; Huntingdon, 1956).
Some Amish who left Berne eventually settled in Alsace-Lorraine, eastern France, and the Palatinate where they gained additional converts. Severe persecution forced them to move frequently and finally prompted their immigration to the United States beginning about 1727. The earliest immigrants came primarily from Switzerland and settled in eastern Pennsylvania; later groups who moved on to Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were converts from other areas in Europe. This diversity in origin and the continued isolation of these communities since their founding have led to the formation of "genetic isolates" with close inbreeding among the descendants (Cross, 1967).

Two characteristics of the Amish make them especially useful for population studies. Firstly, birth control in any form is strictly forbidden, a restriction which stems from the biblical admonition to "be fruitful and multiply." Errant couples are required to confess their wrongdoing before the entire church membership. The enhanced social standing achieved by couples with many children supplies additional pressure to comply with the group norm. Childless couples frequently adopt multiple orphans or offspring of unmarried mothers (usually Amish) . Secondly, standards of living and medical care are relatively high among the Amish. Most recognize the importance of professional prenatal care and preventive health measures. Good medical care is considered a necessity, and families unable to meet expenses are assisted by other members.
No existing Amish community has been the subject of comprehensive population studies, although estimates of certain vital statistics have been made. Smith (1960) used birth and death records, as well as data from published genealogical records, to determine ages at marriage, premarital conception rates, and family sizes during the last century. More current data were used

to determine the age and sex distribution of an existing Amish community in southeastern Pennsylvania (Smith, 1960). Hostetler (1963) obtained data from informants in representative church districts in several states to estimate age and sex distribution, ages at marriage, total population size, and ratios of members to nonmembers. Complete census data have been collected by Mook (1955) for Crawford County, Pennsylvania, by the Old Order Map Committee (1965) for Lancaster and Lebanon counties in Pennsylvania, and by Juberg (1966) for the Amish in northern Indiana.
This report on Amish demography is based on complete census data of Ohio Amish living in Hohnes and immediately adjacent counties, hereafter referred to as the Hohnes County community.
The first Amish to settle in Holmes County arrived in 1810. Rapid internal growth led to formation of other settlements throughout Ohio in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and by 1900 the Hohnes County community was expanding into contiguous areas, namely Wayne County to the north, Tuscarawas County to the east, and Coshocton County to the south (Cross, 1967).
METHODS
The Hohnes County data were gathered in the final quarter of 1964 by distributing printed forms to each family. By working through a community leader who wished to prepare a directory for the use of his coreligionists, the possible stigma resulting from involvement of "outsiders" was avoided. In this manner, data were obtained on 98% of Old Order Amish families in which one or both spouses were alive (excluding the nearly two hundred families of two ultraconservative Hohnes County Amish sects who are theologically distinct).
Information collected on each family included church district of present residence,

mailing address, occupation and birthplace of both parents, names of grandparents, date and place of marriage of the parents, name and marital status of every live-born child, and birth and death dates of all family members. Information on the previous marital partner of remarried individuals was also obtained. All data were stored on computer tape for later analysis and publication (Cross and Gingerich, 1966).
RESULTS
AGE AND SEX DISTRIBUTION
Information collected from 1,933 families revealed a total of 9,724 living individuals. The number of males (4,854) and females (4,870) was nearly equal. The Amish are a young population (Table 1 and Fig. 1); the majority (51.8%) are less than 20 years of age, and 28.7% are less than 10 years old.
The mean percentage of completed families (those in which the mother is at least 45 years of age) for all church districts is 44.9; for the 13 most peripheral districts, the mean percentage is 38.7. Amish parents frequently must buy additional land for their offspring and, since non-Amish farms are more readily available on the fringes of the settlement, newly formed families tend to move centrifugally.
SEX RATIOS
The sex ratio of the Hohnes County Amish population at the end of 1964 was 1.003 which corresponds closely to the ratio of 1.005 for both the Hutterites (Eaton and Mayer, 1953) and the Amish of southeastern Pennsylvania in 1950 (Smith, 1960). This compares with a sex ratio of only 0.971 for the entire United States population, and 1.043 for rural regions alone in 1960 (C. L. Beale, personal communication).
Among Hohnes County Amish under 10 years of age, the sex ratio was 1.037, but females outnumbered males in the 30 to 54 age groups. The sex ratio among 9,023 Hohnes County live births (most stillbirths and

neonatal deaths were not reported) was only 1.022.
OCCUPATIONS
Of 1,930 heads of households and single men not living with their parents, 69.8% considered themselves full or part-time farmers. Another 13.1% were employed in construction and repair trades such as carpentry, cabinet construction, blacksmithing, and harness repairing. A majority of the 12.1% Holmes County Amish men who reported themselves employed as "laborers" probably worked as hired hands on farms or as employees of construction businesses.
Single Amish girls often work as maids for non-Amish families or as store clerks in small towns, but after marriage Amish women are not employed outside the home.
MARITAL PATTERNS
A total of 2,013 first and subsequent marriages were recorded, of which 1,734, or 86.1%, involved partners who were born in the community. In 12.1% of marriages, one of the partners was born in another community. However, many of these "outside" partners were probably offspring of families who had moved into the area, since 63.5%of marriages in which the female was born outside Hohnes County were officiated in Holmes County and Amish weddings are generally celebrated in the bride's home. Similarly, nearly half of the 1.3% of marriages where both partners were born outside the community were solemnized in Holmes County.
Among the 305 marital partners born outside Holmes County, 80.3% came from those communities primarily settled by migrants from the Holmes County community, i.e., those in Ohio, Indiana, and western Pennsylvania (Table 2). An additional 13.8% came from other communities which had in turn been settled by the Indiana community. Only four out of 4,026 partners came from settlements in eastern Pennsylvania.

Of 1,888 first marriages officiated in Hohnes County, 81.2% occurred in October through February and less than 2% occurred in June, July, and August (Fig. 2).
Among 1,887 marriages for which adequate data were available, the mean age at first marriage was 22.57 years for females and 23.61 years for males (Table 3 and Fig. 3). Only seven males and 45 females married before 18 years of age. The median age for females was 23.0 years and for males 24.1 years compared with 20.6 and 22.8 years for females and males, respectively, in the United States in 1965 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1965). Hutterite females marry at a median age of 22.0 years and the males at 23.5 years (Eaton and Mayer, 1953).
The mean age difference for Holmes County Amish couples is 1.05 years (husband older) compared with a 1.5 year differential found by Smith (1960) among southeastern Pennsylvania Amish couples. Surprisingly, however, 34.7% of Hohnes County males marry females older than themselves (Table 3 and Fig. 4). The mean age differential of 2.64 years for marriages in which the husband is older is only 0.71 years greater than the age differential among marriages in which the wife is older.
PREMARITAL CONCEPTIONS
Among 1,888 first marriages in Holmes County, 133, or 7.04%, produced liveborn children within eight months after the marriage date. The mean interval between marriage and first birth was 4.5 months (S.D. = 2.0 months). These 133 couples include six in whom the first birth occurred before marriage; the six intervals ranged from 0.9 to 10.4 months which makes it unlikely that such pregnancies resulted from previously terminated marriages. These six cases are certainly not the only live births which occurred among unmarried females because such offspring are usually adopted by other families and are not listed as a member of the mother's family when she later marries,

a factor which contributes to an underestimation of premarital conceptions.
The mean age at marriage for the 133 Amish couples was 22.37 years for the husbands and 21.15 years for the wives, suggesting that courtship was shortened by approximately one year.
STERILITY
Of 792 Holmes County Amish women who lived with their husbands until at least

45 years of age, only 30, or 3.8%, had never been pregnant. Eaton and Mayer (1953) found that only 10 of 340, or 2.9%, of married Hutterite women never had a live birth. Probably this latter percentage would be even lower if pregnancies instead of live births were considered. These percentages are below the 4 to 5% of married American women who are thought to be unable to become pregnant due to involuntary causes (Thompson and Lewis, 1965).

TWINNING
Among 8,885 pregnancies terminating in live births, 136 produced twins, and one pregnancy terminated in thebirth of triplets (Table 4). This frequency (15.3 per 1,000 live births) of twin births compares with 14.5 and 14.3 per 1,000 total births for the nonwhite population of the United States and thepopulation of Norway, respectively (Guttmacher, 1953; Lilienfeld and Pasamanick, 1955; Stern, 1960), two populations with thehighest known twinning frequency. Among the Northern Indiana Amish, the twinning frequency is 21.1 per 1,000 livebirths (Juberg, 1966).

If one assumes a 1:1 sex ratio at birth and ascertainment of twins without regard to zygosity, theproportion of mono- and dizygotic twins canbe estimated by Weinberg's differential method. Since the total number of dizygotic pairs should be equal to twice the number of unlike sexpairs, 110pairs of twins should bedizygotic and26 pairs monozygotic. Therefore, approximately 82% of all twin births in theHohnes County Amish would bedizygous compared with 64 to 76%

FERTILITY
Crude birth rate.--The Amish crude birth rate is 33.3, compared with 21.2 for the entire United States for the same year (United Nations, Í964) and 45.9 for the Hutterites in 1948 (Eaton and Mayer, 1953), and is comparable to the rate in the United States in 1900 (Grabill, Kiser, and Whelpton, 1958).

matching Amish reproductive capacity during early married life, greatly outperform them in middle age and sustain a higher birth rate until menopause. As a result, among all married women aged 15 to 49, the Hutterites have a 26% greater fertility rate.
Completed fertility.--Data on number of pregnancies and number of children were collected by personal interviews of all Holmes County Amish families in which the wife was at least 45 years of age on December 31, 1964 (Cross, 1967). The mean num-

Fertility ratio.--The number of children aged 0-4 years per thousand Amish women 20-44 years of age is 1,010, a ratio 48.7% higher than the ratio existing among all rural white inhabitants in the east North Central United States in 1950 (Grabill et al., 1958).
Age-standardized nuptial fertility rales.-- These rates are high for Amish women between the ages of 19 and 40, but Hutterite women outperform them in all age groups with the greatest difference being among women over the age of 30 years (Table 5). Thus, Hutterite women, although nearly

her of reported Amish pregnancies was 7.19 with a standard deviation of 3.69. More than half of these women (56.5%) reported seven or more pregnancies while 26.6% reported 10 or more (Table 6).
Because pregnancy data are somewhat unreliable (for example, most pregnancies terminated in the first trimester are probably not reported), the number of live births per woman is a more reliable indicator of fertility for comparisons between populations with similar standards of living and medical care. Amish completed families had a mean number of 6.33 children compared

with 8.96 for Hutterites (Fig. 5). Nearly half of Hutterite women (48.3%) have 10 or more liveborn children compared with only 17.9% of Amish women.
Natural increase.--Using a standard life table, the Amish net reproduction rate is 2,454, compared with 3,830 for the Hutterites and less than 2,000 for California and New York populations (Table 7). The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) for the Amish is 3.019% compared with 4.1265% for the Hutterites (Eaton and Mayer, 1953).

Thus the Amish could increase in number by about 145% each generation (where a generation is considered the number of years corresponding to the mean maternal age for all Amish births, 29.68 years) or double in number every 23 years.
BIRTH INTERVALS
Due to interfamily variations in fertility, birth intervals must be arranged according to family size, and therefore only data from completed families can be used. The birth

intervals in Table 8 were obtained from interviews with completed Holmes County families (i.e., those in which the mother was at least 45 years of age) and exclude those with known fetal wastage.
In Table 8, intervals from marriage to birth of the first child include only marriages of 8 months or more duration in order to eliminate the majority of premarital conceptions. The mean of these intervals is 19.9 months, excluding one-child families since their interval to first birth is nearly twice as long as families with more than one live birth. Since this first interval is the only one which does not include a prior anovulatory period, it is estimated that the average married woman required 10.9 months of exposure to the risk of pregnancy before conception occurred. The mean intervals between births are longer, suggesting that the period of postpartum infecundity is of the order of 6 to 8 months, compared with the 5 to 7 month period calculated by Sheps (1965) for the Hutterites. For unexplained reasons, the interval preceding the last birth is usually longer than intervals between previous births. This is also true of the Indiana Amish (Juberg, 1966) and certain other popula-

tions, but the Hutterites appear to be an exception (Sheps, 1965).
It has been reported (Renkonen and Lehtovaara, 1962; Renkonen, 1964) that the sex of the preceding child may influence the length of the interval to the next birth, but this is not true in the Hohnes County Amish. Data from 7,108 births (excluding first births) revealed no significant difference in the length of the interval to the next birth whether the previous child was male or female.
DISCUSSION
Comparison of the age pyramids (Fig. 1) of the Holmes County Amish and their rural living neighbors provides graphic proof of the cultural and social isolation of the Amish. Their self-sufficient agrarian existence renders them independent of cyclic depressing and stimulating effects of political, economic, and social changes which produce variations in the size of non-Amish age groups. Similar evidence of isolation has been found in the Hutterites (Eaton and Mayer, 1953; Steinberg et al., 1967).
The sex ratio of Amish over the age of 55 (1.216) is much higher than that of the general United States population. For reasons as yet unknown, Amish men tend to outlive their wives. A predominance of males among older age groups was also noted in the Hutterites by Eaton and Mayer (1953) and confirmed in a later census by Steinberg and colleagues (1967). Eaton and Mayer (1953) suggested that multiparity may have an adverse effect on longevity. Additional evidence for their hypothesis comes from the study of Indiana Amish by Juberg (1966) who found the lowest mean number of offspring among older women. Hohnes County Amish women do have a high fertility, but no direct evidence is available to confirm the Eaton and Mayer hypothesis.
Amish marital patterns in all communities are characterized by monogamy and

strict endogamy. Divorce is forbidden and, although on rare occasion marital discord leads to separation of the partners, they may not remarry until the spouse has died. The choice of marital partners is not limited to a single community, but rather to members of the entire clan. In practice, of course, the pool of available mates is greatly reduced by the limitations of horse-and-buggy transportation. This limits courtship to the local settlement although rare exceptions occur as the result of the limited practice of "hiring out" to other Amish communities for short periods. Even this travel between communities is not random, however, but is strongly influenced by family ties and certain less visible ideological similarities. For example, the Hohnes County community, which contributed most of the settlers of the Northern Indiana community, has considerably more contact with the Indiana Amish than with the eastern Pennsylvania Amish. The latter are in many ways more traditional and conservative, although these ideological differences in most cases do not result in formal "shunning" of each other's members. As might be expected, other communities in Ohio have the greatest interchange with the Holmes County community (Table 2).
The wedding season of Amish in northern Indiana is comparable to that of the Holmes County Amish. Among a sample of Amish families in Indiana, 42.6% married in November and December while 78.1% married in the months of October through February (Juberg, 1966), compared to 46.0 and 81.2% for the same periods in Holmes County. Among the Amish of eastern Pennsylvania, however, Smith (1960) found that 92.0% of 1,231 weddings during 1890 to 1959 took place in November and December.
An Amish wedding is an elaborate affair in which the majority of friends and relatives are expected to participate. Their antiquated farming methods require dawn-todusk labor during the spring and summer, leaving little time for social events. This is

96

largely responsible for the seasonality of weddings shown in Fig. 2 which illustrates not only the conformity in this rigid society, but also demands an explanation for the 1.9 per cent of weddings which occur in the summer months of June, July, and August. Though obviously not the reason in all cases, premarital conception is probably the most urgent cause of "out of season" weddings. A strong sense of responsibility plus religious sanctions influences the vast majority of biological fathers to marry their pregnant mates. Among marriages which occurred during the summer months and in which couples had lived together for at least nine months when the census was taken, 55.9% recorded the birth of a child less than seven months after the date of marriage. This premarital pregnancy rate is nearly seven times greater than the rate among all marriages.
Remarriages may be less seasonal because the social event is less elaborate and timeconsuming. Smith (1960) found that 36.1% of all remarriages among Pennsylvania Amish occurred "out of season" compared to 8% of first marriages. The wedding season of 87 remarriages recorded in Hohnes County, however, differed little from that of first marriages. The majority (89.6%) were remarriages of males and 77% of these chose previously unmarried females.
Contrary to a prevailing impression, the Amish do not marry at a younger age than the rest of the population. The misconception has probably persisted because the Amish have several characteristics of groups in which marriages occur at a young agerural living, poor education, and large families. However, Amish mothers frequently urge their daughters to delay marriage in order to limit their eventual family size, and this no doubt is one reason for the more advanced age at marriage. The same reason probably also explains in part the unusually high proportion of wives who are older than their husbands.
Premarital intercourse is strongly dis-

couraged, even condemned by the Amish theocracy. Those who transgress are expelled from the membership and are required to make oral confession before the entire church membership before reinstatement. It is important to note, however, that when premarital conceptions do occur, illegitimacy due to uncertain paternity usually does not result since in most cases the biological parents marry. Juberg (1966), for example, using ABO, Rh, and MN blood typing, found no paternal exclusions among 1,098 offspring of 155 couples. In even more extensive continuing family studies, mainly in the Pennsylvania Lancaster County Amish, W. Bias (personal communication) has found no inconsistencies pointing to false paternity.
Data on premarital conceptions among the Amish are all retrospective and tabulated from information voluntarily supplied by couples during the course of généalogie or census studies. No doubt a certain unknown amount of error results from juggling of marriage and first birth dates, but this error is probably small since the moral stigma of premarital violations, once confessed, does not remain among the Amish.
Smith (1960) calculated a somewhat lower percentage of premarital conceptions for Amish families in southeastern Pennsylvania, an average of 4 . 1 % among couples married between 1890 and 1949. It is not known what accounts for the lower rate of premarital conceptions in the Pennsylvania than in the Ohio community.
In spite of religious pressures, Amish females have approximately the same premarital conception frequency as females in other rural United States communities. For example, Christensen (1963) found that 9.7% of births within wedlock in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, were premaritally conceived compared with 7.8% in Defiance County, Ohio (in which some Amish live), and 3.7% among the Mormons in Utah. These percentages are much lower than

those found in urban United States communities and some European countries (Pratt, 1965; Hair, 1966; Goldstein, 1967).
The lack of an increased amount of sterility in inbred groups such as the Hutterites and the Amish suggests that recessive genes are not a significant cause of sterility. It is also possible, of course, that such genes, if they exist, were by chance not segregating in either of these populations.
The frequency of twin births varies among countries and ethnic groups due principally to differences in the frequency of dizygotic twin births (Komai and Fukuoka, 1936). Such ethnic differences together with occasional familial aggregation have been cited as evidence for the role of genetic factors in twinning. The fact that the frequency of dizygosity in the two inbred Amish groups is more than 60% greater than the frequency of 7.4 per 1,000 livebirths among whites in the United States suggests that recessive genes are involved.
In addition to genetic factors, however, the frequency of dizygotic twins is also influenced by increased maternal age and increased parity (Stern, 1960; Scheinfeld, 1965). These influences act individually and in the same direction. Among the Indiana Amish, Juberg (1966) found that, on the average, twin pregnancies were located among the latter one-half of all pregnancies, but the mean maternal age for twin pregnancies was the same as the mean maternal age for all pregnancies. The mean parity position for Hohnes County twin births is 4.35, which is also in the latter one-half of the average of 7.19 pregnancies per female. The mean maternal age for twin births is 30.0 years compared with a mean maternal age of 29.7 years for all Ohio Amish births. Although few accurate data are available, the median age of United States women at the birth of their last child is probably between 25.5 and 27.5 years, and the average number of children ever born is approximately 2.35 (Glick, 1957). I t is estimated

(Scheinfeld, 1965) that the probability of a twin birth is increased four-fold for fifth or sixth pregnancies in mothers aged 35 to 39 compared with primípara 15 to 19 years old. Therefore, the higher parity and increased maternal age in Amish mothers alone may account for the increased frequency of dizygous twins.
Since some familial aggregation of twinning is present in the Hohnes County population, genetic factors cannot be ruled out entirely, however. Eleven, or 9.9% of the families with twin births, accounted for 17.5% of all twin births (Table 4).
The Holmes County Amish demonstrate several characteristics previously noted in other ethnic groups with high fertility (Juberg, 1966; Sheps, 1965; Henry, 1961; Tietze, 1957). The more fertile women have shorter intervals between births, as one might expect, because the reproductive span is finite. However, factors other than shortened intervals alone are involved, since such women also continue reproducing for a longer period after marriage.
Birth intervals lengthen with increasing birth order for a given family size. This has been attributed to maternal aging (Tietze, 1957), although other factors such as parity and length of cohabitation have not been ruled out. Even paternal factors may be important hi a manner similar to the decrease hi the sex ratio of offspring caused by paternal aging (Novitzki and Kimball, 1958). Evidence for an effect of parity and against a maternal age effect alone is suggested by the fact that mean intervals for a given birth order are remarkably stable when all families (with mothers of various ages) are included.
Other than delayed marriage, the Amish have not attempted to limit their family size in the past, and there is no evidence that their attitudes toward procreation have changed recently. Smith (1960) found no increase in the percentage of childless couples and no decrease in the size of Amish

families between 1890 and 1949. Among the northern Indiana Amish, Juberg (1966) found no evidence that attempts were made to limit family size. Huntingdon (1956), in the most recent sociological study of the Holmes County Amish, concluded that they do not practice birth control by mechanical or chemical means, and although a few couples illegally attempt to use the "rhythm method," they have little success. Surgical sterilization is reserved for exceptional cases. Two studies (Huntingdon, 1956; Cross, 1967) encompassing a total of 8 years of observation of the Holmes County community revealed only two couples in whom surgical sterilization was performed. Direct inquiries to several Holmes County Amish deacons brought emphatic denials that birth control in any form is permitted today.
It was previously noted that the Hutterites have a higher fertility than the Amish, although the two groups are similar in standards of living and medical care and neither apparently uses modern methods of birth control. Several factors, both cultural and biological, may explain the differing reproductive performance since apparently all act in the same direction.
Firstly, Hutterite women marry about one year earlier than Amish women. Secondly, the mean interval from marriage to birth of the first child is 13 months for Hutterite women (Sheps, 1965) compared with nearly 20 months for Amish women.1 Thirdly, mean intervals between births in the Hutterites are less than 25 months, and the longest interval found was that leading to the thirteenth birth: 24.8 months (Sheps, 1965). Among Amish women, however, all intervals are greater than 24 months; the longest is 37.8 months, and the overall average is 28.2 months (Table 8). The number of years between marriage and birth of the last child is nearly the same in the two ethnic groups, although Amish women with smaller

families actually reproduce 3 to 5 years longer than do Hutterite women.
The Hutterites provide communal care and education for all offspring and thus can accommodate large numbers of offspring more readily than can the Amish where each family is individually responsible for all facets of family life and education. That such cultural factors may play a role is suggested by the nearly equal age-specific nuptial fertility rates among young couples in both populations followed by a rapid drop in reproductivity among older Amish women. Thus, the Amish may be effectively reducing total family size by means of practices as yet not admitted or identified.
It is difficult to accept cultural influences on family planning as playing an important role, however, since no discernible trend toward smaller Amish families can be detected. Increasing knowledge and availability of contraceptive methods as well as economic pressures due to scarcity and cost of tillable farmland would lead one to suspect that, if family limitation is practiced, Amish families today should be smaller than in previous decades. However, the number of pregnancies (Table 9) and live births of women from completed Ohio Amish families shows no consistent or recent decrease. Similarly, Juberg (1966) found no decrease but rather a slight increase in mean number of offspring born to younger mothers. Smith (1960) also noted a slight increase in the average number of children born to more recently married couples compared with all couples married between 1890 and 1929; and, in addition, the proportion of Pennsylvania couples with 10 or more children also increased. These data indicate that the number of offspring per Amish couple has been nearly constant for at least six decades. Furthermore, using available estimates of the growth of the Old Order Amish population in North America (Hostetler, 1963) and considering that some defections do occur, the actual growth rate corresponds reason-

Vol. 17, No. 2

ably well with the calculated potential increase of 145%per generation. From 1905 to 1930, the Amish population increased by 125% and from 1930 to 1960 it increased 134%. Without evidence for any significant variation in the defection rate during this period, these figures provide additional evidence for the constancy of Amish fertility rates throughout this century.
The higher Hutterite fertility is apparently due to shorter birth intervals for whatever reason. A miscarriage or stillbirth prolongs the interval approximately three months (Potter, 1963), but there is no evidence of greater pregnancy wastage in the Amish. The data presented here suggest that the period of post-partum infecundity is slightly greater in the Amish, although data on the length of post-partum amenorrhea and the number of anovulatory cycles would

be required to establish this. A significant difference in fecundity or probability ofconception in the twogroups is suggested by the fact that nulliparous Amish women require about seven more months of exposure to the risk of pregnancy before conception leading to a livebirth occurs.
SUMMARY
Members of the Old Order Amish who live in the Holmes County, Ohio, community shun modern means of birth control in spite of having relatively high standards of living and medical care. Population studies of the entire population of 9,724 individuals were undertaken in1964.
The broad-based population pyramid of this community is characteristic of a young population in which the majority of individuals are under 20 years of age. The social
