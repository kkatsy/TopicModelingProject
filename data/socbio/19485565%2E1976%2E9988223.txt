son with general populations norms, the sample should include: more males than females; more broken than intact homes, especially for females; and more large than small families, especially for males.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects studied were 182 delinquents, aged 10-20 years, referred consecutively by probation officers for psychological evaluation for "treatment planning."
Intact homes were defined as those in which the child resided with both natural parents. Small families were defined as containing 1-3 children; large families, 4-13 children.
Expectations for the general population were estimated from census figures (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, p. 69) in order to compute the significance of deviations from those expectations by means of a chi-square test.
RESULTS
As expected, the delinquent sample contained more males than females (70 per

cent vs. 30 per cent; chi-square equals 28.48, p < 0.001).
The hypotheses about the incidence of broken homes were also verified in this sample. Delinquents came from broken homes more often than would be expected from norms for the general population, and broken homes were more typical of delinquent females than of delinquent males (Table 1).
As expected, delinquents tended to come from large families, whether intact or broken. Large family size was more typical of male than of female delinquents. Males' mean family size was 5.27 compared to 4.13 for females' families (t equals 2.59, p < 0.05).
Of the 127 males, 16 came from families of 9 children or more; of the 55 females, only 1 came from so large a family. The difference is significant by a post-hoc Fisher's exact test (p < 0.05).
A three-way analysis of variance was performed on family size, by sex, broken/ intact home, and Anglo/non-Anglo ethnic groups. Family size varied significantly by
