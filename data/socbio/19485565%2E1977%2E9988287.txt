ABSTRACT: Abortions performed in upper New York State and in New York City over a six-year period were examined for monthly variation in conception. Significant differences in the month of conception were observed which correlated strongly with monthly conception indices from previous studies of conception leading to illegitimate and legitimate births. Since, for the most part, aborted pregnancies were unwanted, the current findings support the notion that cyclical changes in fecundity may be responsible for seasonality of conception rather than seasonal preferences for marriage followed by an increased risk of conception in the early months after marriage.

Seasonal variation in births has long been recorded in the United States (Huntington, 1938; Waggoner and Schachter, 1959; Rosenberg, 1966). As early as 1933, September was observed to be the "season of birth" and although subsequent shifts in intensity of the birth-season relationship have been observed, the underlying shape of the seasonal trends have remained uniform (Rosenberg, 1966).
Various causal interpretations have been proposed for these observations including work patterns and festivals (Huntington, 1938; Smolensky et al., 1972). Seasonal fluctuations in birth have been found to correlate highly with principal holidays in Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece (Takahashi, 1964). Seasonality of birth has been found to be related significantly to climate in Hong Kong (Chang et al., 1963) but to be unrelated to geographic region in the United States (Rosenberg, 1966). Other investigators have examined the relationship between month of marriage and month of first birth (Waggoner and Schachter, 1959) and between birth seasonality and socioeconomic status (Pasamanick, 1960).

Seasonality of births could be due to either seasonality in conceptions or seasonality in fetal deaths, or both. Spontaneous abortion rates in Canadian women were found to peak in the spring (March to June) and prompted speculation of a causal relationship with infective agents which thrive in the spring (McDonald, 1971). A seasonal rate of spontaneous abortion, however, would occur if conception was seasonal and fetal mortality remained constant. Alternatively, changes in conception and fetal mortality could both result from the same underlying endogenous seasonal rhythms.
Seasonal variation in conception could be due to either changes in the frequency of coitus or changes in female or male fecundity. Udry and Morris (1967) found no seasonal variation in coital rates of married New York couples. This finding, however, can not be generalized to unmarried couples among whom seasonality of coitus may occur. However, seasonal variation among illegitimate births has been reported to follow the same seasonal pattern as legitimate births, with conceptions occurring more frequently in No-

to standardize the data for the number of days per month, they were adjusted to provide the average number of abortions a day each month. A "ratio to twelve-month moving average" was utilized to remove underlying fluctuations in the data. While this procedure had the disadvantage of losing twelve data points, it yielded a smoother data base for trend analysis.
These data were entered into an analysis of variance to see whether the differ-

ences between months could have occurred by chance. The results are shown in Table 2. In both samples the observed intermonthly variation in abortions was significant at the 0.01 level.
The component for each month was computed by utilizing the mean values of each of the monthly arrays of the percentages of the twelve-month moving averages; for example, the mean of all the January percentages of the twelve-month

Examination of Table 3 shows that in each sample more abortions are performed in the earlier part of the year. The Upstate New York data peak in March and the New York City data in February-March. There is a steady decline in both samples from April through December except for two smaller peaks in June and August. Calculation of Kendall's coefficient of concordance showed very high agreement between the two samples in the monthly abortion rates {W = 0.96, p < 0.0S).
Since abortion almost entirely reflects unwanted conceptions, it was of interest to correlate the abortion ranking with a seasonal index of illegitimate births. For this analysis, Rosenberg's (1966) index was used (Table 4). The gestational age of pregnancies terminated by abortion in New York at this time was 82.3 per cent under 13 weeks, 15.3 per cent at 13 to 20 weeks, and 2.4 per cent over 20 weeks, giving an average gestation of between 10 and 12 weeks (Tietze, 1973). The birth data were lagged by six months to adjust for time of conception in both groups. A single abortion index was developed from the joint ranks of the two abortion samples. A Spearman rank correlation coefficient in-

dicated very strong agreement between the month of conception in our combined abortion sample and Rosenberg's sample of illegitimate births (r, = 0.82, p < 0.01).
A similar analysis compared Rosenberg's index of legitimate births (also shown in Table 4) with the abortion index. Here also a very strong level of agreement between the time of conception in the two groups was found (rs = 0.88, p < 0.01).
DISCUSSION
Before discussing the results of the analysis, we would like to point out that during the six-year period covered by this study the number of abortions performed in New York rose considerably through early 1973 as more women took advantage of their availability and then declined as the United States Supreme Court ruling of January, 1973, made abortions easier to obtain in other states. Also, a great amount of publicity resulted from legislative actions and court cases which may have influenced abortion-seeking behavior and timing.
Future investigations might analyze abortion data only for women who are not married at the time of abortion (a distinction that was not made in our own data set). This distinction would permit a more sensitive examination of the hypothesis

that monthly variation of conception follows the incidence of marriage. Moreover, we would recommend that more precise adjustments for gestational age of the pregnancy at abortion be made so that time of conception may be more accurately estimated. The three-month mean used in our analysis is based upon a range from approximately 4 to 24 weeks gestation.
Since marriages in New York City peak 35 per cent above their annual mean in June and 20 per cent above the mean in August (Erhardt et al., 1971), it has always been tempting to speculate that this peak is responsible for a higher incidence of conceptions toward the end of the year. While it has been suggested that conception occurs more frequently in the first month of marriage (Whelpton et al., 1966), rather than in the fourth to sixth month demanded by the observed seasonality of conceptions in New York (Erhardt et al., 1971), it is possible that contraceptive practice which is widely used among married couples is delaying conception until then. Certainly contraception would be expected to reduce the amplitude of seasonal trends in conception.
Rosenberg's (1966) analysis of illegitimate births does not support the marriage hypothesis, nor does the current analysis of unwanted conception among abortion patients in New York. The agreement between our own data and Rosenberg's index of seasonality for both legitimate and illegitimate births is highly significant.

The unwanted products of conception aborted by women in New York during the six years studied showed the same monthly variation in conceptions that would be predicted from women delivering both legitimate and illegitimate children, namely conception in November and December.
Monthly variation in abortion is also of considerable interest to the providers of abortion services. The present analysis indicates that the utilization of abortion facilities is likely to rise between 20 per cent and 25 per cent from December to March. This relatively sudden increase in abortion applications could result in ineffective planning and poor service unless preparation is made for it.
We would conclude that there appears to be significant and predictable variation in the monthly rate of abortion during any one year. Monthly variation in the conception of aborted unwanted pregnancies is significantly and positively correlated to seasonal variation in conception of illegitimate and legitimate births reported by other investigators and lends support to the notion that biological phenomena are responsible for seasonal changes in fecundity and, therefore, of conceptions.
