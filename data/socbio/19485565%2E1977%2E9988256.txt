ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether air pollution in the Los Angeles Basin is affecting birth weight. The data base for the study consisted of daily air pollutant averages from the Air Pollution Control District of Los Angeles County, California, obstetric records of births at the University of Califoria at Los Angeles Hospital for the year 1973, and smoking information on each gravida. The effect of total pollution level was significantly negatively associated with birth weight after removing the effects of other variables significantly associated with birth weight. Infants born to nonsmoking women who lived in the more polluted areas ofthe city weigh an average of 314 grams less than infants born to women living in the less polluted areas.

The constituents of polluted air occur The proposition to be tested is that in-

of most pollutants are toxic. Studies of the effects of moderate levels
of these substances recorded in polluted air have focused on direct health effects such as respiratory illnesses, mortality, hospital admissions, etc. Recent evidence indicates that the correlation between air pollution and mortality is significant (Lave and Seskin, 1970; Kitagawa and Häuser, 1973). The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether air pollution levels are correlated with a reduction of birth weight, which is one measure of the maturity of a neonate and is predictive of a neonate's relative probability of survival (Kara andPenrose, 19S1;Yerushalmy, 1970; Armstrong, 1972).

1. Women whosmoke onepack of cigarettes a day have infants who weigh 100-300 grams less than nonsmoking mothers (Rush and Kass, 1972). 2. Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels from 6 to 10per cent measured on women who are smoking one pack of cigarettes a day are thought to be theprimary causal components in the observed weight reduction of infants born to these women (Younoszai et al., 1968; Longo, 1976). 3. Carbon monoxide levels of 300 parts per million are often recorded in the LosAngeles Basin (APCD Annual Report, 1972). These levels and durations of CO in ambient air produce COHb levels equal to those recorded on persons smoking one pack of cigarettes a day. In addition, persons living in Los Angeles have been observed to have significant COHb concentrations in their blood (Stewart et al., 1973).
4. The reproductive success of experimental animals has been impaired in atmospheres containing not only CO, but also NO2and O3 at levels simulating those recorded in the Los Angeles Basin (Hueter et al., 1966; Lewis et al., 1967).

toring station were computed.
Each woman in the study was assigned the station number of the nearest air pollution monitoring station to her residence.

The region from which the data were obtained to test this proposition was the Los Angeles Basin, California. Because of the combination of meteorology, geographic location, climate, sunlight, and heavy automobile traffic, the Los Angeles Basin has been plagued by air pollution. Air pollution zones, each monitored by a recording station, have been established, and elevated levels of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) which are known to be toxic are often recorded (APCD Annual Report, 1972).

The averages were then incorporated into each woman's record such that the ninemonth average covered the gestation period and the three-month averages specified the mean level for each trimester of the pregnancy.
The third major source of data was smoking information. A systematic sample of 1,500 gravidae was selected, and letters explaining the research were sent to these women. The women were requested to complete and mail a postcard which contained two questions on smoking habits during their most recent pregnancy. The

Several modes of interaction between pollution constituents or concentrations and birth weight were hypothesized because of the complex chemical and temporal nature of pollutants. These hypotheses included that one, several, or all of the pollutants affect birth weight during one or more trimesters, or the effects were limited to particular seasons of the year irrespective of the particular trimester of the fetus.
Data from the nonsmoking respondents were tested by stepwise regression for the relationship between each of the pollutants, CO, NCh, and Cb, and birth weight

The average for the monitoring station with the highest annual level in this sample, Station 83, was set to Level 10, and each lesser station assigned the relative proportion compared to 83, times 10, so that the range was index values from 1to 10. The women residing in areas on the periphery of LosAngeles were classified as having exposure to negligible amounts of pollution and served as the control group. These annual averages, referred to as total pollution level, plus the relative pollution concentration of the stations are listed in Table 4.

All three pollutants were tested for the effect of seasonal variation in their concentrations. Regression analysis failed to reveal any relationship between seasonal fluctuations in pollution concentrations and birth weight. Also, when respondents' infants were divided into four groups by season of birth, mean birth weights among groups did not vary, validating the lack of seasonal effect on birth weight.

Of the 121 intermediate and internal variables recorded for each grávida and her infant, only nine were found to be significantly associated with birth weight of the infant. These variables, along with total pollution level, are listed in the matrix of simple correlations shown in Table 5. The nine variables are defined as follows:

2. Maternal age.is years completed at the time of birth of the infant. 3. Parity is defined as the number of pregnancies a woman has had, excluding her current pregnancy. 4. Antenatal care is the total amount of antenatal care a grávida received, measured in weeks. 5. Prepregnantweight is the weight before becoming pregnant. 6. Weight gain is the difference between the weight at the time of delivery and the prepregnant weight.
7. Sex is sex of the infant. 8. Gestation length is measured in weeks. 9. Smoking is the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Patients were divided into five groups ranging from zero cigarettes per day to more than one pack a day.

It is evident from Table 5 that all of the above variables except socioeconomic status are significantly correlated with birth weight. In addition, socioeconomic status and sex of the infant are significantly correlated with pollution level as well as with birth weight. Therefore, regression analysis was undertaken to determine the extent of the independent effects on birth weight of the nine variables listed above and the extent of the interaction among the variables. The computations reveal that socioeconomic status, maternal age, and antenatal care are not significantly associated with birth weight, the positive effect of parity is still significant after controlling for maternal age, and the interaction effects between sex of infant and pollution level and between socioeconomic status and pollution level are nonsignificant for respondents (Table 6).

And, third, although the birth records from UCLA were randomly selected, perhaps women who deliver at UCLA are not a random sample of all those who deliver in Los Angeles.

tributes to a reduction in birth weight is of concern because of the predictable relationship of birth weight to mortality. Specifically, the reported infant mortality rates increase from 6.86/1,000 for the 3.5014.000 kg birth weight class to 8.85/1,000 for the lighter 3.000-3.500 kg class, for

predictably could lead to a 17 per cent increase in infant mortality.
This estimate of increased mortality is conservative since the data are for U.S. whites who tend to be of higher socioeconomic status and to live in less polluted areas of the cities than nonwhites. A decrement of 314 grams in the nonwhite groups could be associated with an even greater loss of life if there is an additive or synergistic effect of lower socioeconomic class and pollution. In addition, the monitoring zones included in this study are not the most polluted zones in the Los Angeles Basin, and there may be even more of a reduction in weight associated with heavier pollution levels.
Until now, the health effects known to be associated with pollution are increases in respiratory illnesses and in adult mortality rates. Since adult mortality comes after childbearing age, there is presumably no selection pressure from pollution.

However, if pollution is causing a reduc-
tion in birth weight, then there is evidence
of pollution as an agent of selection; and
certain subpopulations living in the less
desirable parts of urban centers may suffer
relatively more intensive selection due to
the effects of pollution.
