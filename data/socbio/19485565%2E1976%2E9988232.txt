Jerome H. Waller
Human Genetics Program Departmentof Biostatistics University of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ABSTRACT: Data from this study and five earlier studies are analyzed to determine the magnitude and significance of the influence of sex combinations of prior children upon the ultimate (or completed) number of children in the family. In addition to confirming the observation of earlier investigators that the influence of combinations of sexes in the first two children differs by geographic area, it is shown that a difference has occurred in a single region over time, and the data for the most recent cohort suggest an effect of social class as well. Three measures of association (the corrected odds ratio, the natural logarithm of this ratio, and the fourfold point correlation) point to a small magnitude of the influence studied even when it is present at a statistically significant level. Notes on sample size relative to levels of  and  errors are included, as is discussion of a valid method of combining contingency tables.

Among the factors determining the number of persons to be supported by a finite earth are birth rate, age at reproduction, and mortality. Ultimate (or "complete") family size reflects the interaction of these three variables and can serve as an indicator of the rate at which a population is expanding or contracting in size. Several recent studies have indicated that the combination of sexes among the offspring already present may influence ultimate family size by affecting the decision of parents to limit their reproduction (Loyd and Gray, 1969; Ayala and Falk, 1971; Gray, 1972; Gray and Morrison, 1974).
Empirical evidence on this point has been found to differ by geographic location and by (inferred) social class of the parents. An investigation of this question some twenty-five years ago (Thomas, 1951), using 470 families related to medical students at the University of Glasgow, found that the frequency of families having more than two children was sig-

nificantly higher when the first two children were of the same sex than when they were of opposite sex. Loyd and Gray (1969) reported similar results when they studied 690 families of college students from central Kentucky.
On the other hand, Ayala and Falk (1971) examined data for 425 immediate families of college students resident in New England and found no significant difference in these frequencies. In addition, they reanalyzed the data presented by Gray and pointed out that owing to the lack of independence between those families having only two children and those having more than two, Gray's statistical test was of "doubtful validity". Ayala and Falk then concluded that the sex of the first two children had indeed influenced family size in the Glasgow sample, but not in the two American studies.
Three years after his first study with R. C. Loyd (Loyd and Gray, 1969), Gray
(1972) collected data for 415 additional

backgrounds. In this connection, Rainwater (1965, p. 131) found that "concern about the sex of children seemed to be at its low point in the upper-middle class and at its high point in the upper-lower class." If this was so in the general population of each of the American studies, the findings of no significant difference between the reproductive behavior of parents having children of the same sex and those having prior children of both sexes would be expected a priori. The one anomalous case from this point of view would be the sample from Vanderbilt University (Gray and Morrison, 1974), and that anomaly might vanish if it were shown that the sample had included relatively more students from lower-class families due to recently broadened admission policies.
With these studies in mind, the primary objective of the present investigation was to examine the reproductive history of a sample of persons representing a general regional population (the Upper Midwest of the United States or more particularly the state of Minnesota and its neighboring states) for an influence of combinations of sexes of the first two to four offspring upon ultimate (or completed) family size. A secondary objective was to investigate the effect of social status upon concern about the sex of the offspring, insofar as this could be inferred from the sex composition of completed families.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Two earlier publications (Rao et al., 1973, and Waller et al. 1973) have discussed other aspects of a sample of 2,393 unions drawn from those in the pedigrees published by Elizabeth W. and Sheldon C. Reed (1965). Of this total number, 2,247 unions constituted the starting point of the present investigation. The difference (146 couples) is due to incomplete information for one or both spouses or for at least one of their offspring.

Table 1 delineates the number of couples excluded from the present study and presents the reasons for their exclusion. The exclusions were done in the order stated and are nonoverlapping. The interval 1843 to 1927 for year of birth of the adult women resulted from two considerations. At first, the upper limit was conservatively established as the year 1917, taking into account that maternal age of 40 years signifies the completion of fertility for 98 per cent of the women in this population (see Waller, 1971) and that the bulk of the field work was completed by the Reed group around 1957. An additional 272 families were available from follow-up work done by the present author, completed in 1967 (see Table 2), and which consisted of the ten-year cohort by birth of mother between 1918 and 1927. Examination of the published data for 73 women from the larger sample born in this latter interval showed that the outcome of those unions did not differ significantly from the cohort more recently reexamined in either sex composition of the

offspring or in mean number of offspring. Hence the upper limit for year of birth of the women was raised to 1927. Since the generation length in human populations is approximately 25 years, it was possible to work backward from the ten-year cohort dates and include women born as early as 1843. The end result was three 25-year cohorts containing 99, 319, and 400 women respectively, and one ten-year cohort containing 375 women.
Limitation of the present study to persons having two or more children further restricted the sample sizes to 75, 221, 258, and 336 (see Table 3). These data were then analyzed to shed light on the primary question: whether the combination of sexes in the first two to four children influences the decision to enlarge the family. Values of the occupational and educational status of the male parent were available for only 272 of the 336 couples in the 1918-27 cohort. These data were examined in an attempt to meet the second objective of the study, namely, whether concern about the combination of sexes among the children shows any association with socioeconomic status.
Several nonparametric techniques were employed in addition to the straightforward contingency table analysis of earlier workers. Comparisons were made among the four possible combinations of sex of the first two children, in addition to grouping them as "same" vs. "different." This amounts to partitioning a 4 x 2 contingency table into three orthogonal components, each with a single degree of freedom. This partitioning ultilized adjustment for the variance of the column sums, as described by Li (1961, pp. 9597). Analysis for differences among cohorts, combinations in the first two children, and outcomes (Table 7) employed a three-way multiple chi-square technique. The Fortran program MCHISQ developed by the Learning Research and

Development Center of the University of Pittsburgh was used in this comparison. For certain 2 X 2 tables Fisher's Exact Test was used, owing its use to small numbers in one or more cells. For this test, the Fortran program FEXACT (Sokal and Rohlf, 1969) was modified by the present author for use in time-sharing mode on the PDP-10 computer of the University of Pittsburgh.
Probabilities of the values of chi-square were calculated using Jaspen's approximation (Jaspen, 1965) where noted; otherwise, they were obtained by use of the Monroe 1770 desk calculator. This last method was possible only where the degrees of freedom equaled one and took advantage of the fact that Xi2 d.f. = Z2. Hence one can take the square root of the chi-square value and use the Monroe 177O's preprogrammed calculation of areas under the unit normal curve to find the probability of the given chi-square value.
RESULTS
Taken together, the data of Tables 2 and 3 serve to characterize this sample more specifically. In Table 3, the data show a sharp decline in mean number of offspring for "all families" between the first and second cohort, no significant difference between the second and third, and a rise between the third and fourth. This last cohort includes women whose fertility was completed in the years after World War II. While the number in that cohort of this study is very small, the data at hand are at least consistent with national trends (Campbell, 1973). The distributions of numbers of offspring (Table 2) show that the observed changes in means (Table 3) were produced by a combination of decreasing proportions of childless women and decreasing proportions of families having six or more children. All of these means are higher than would be the na-

in each cohort, the total number of families increasing should equal the total number of families in the next comparison. That they do not is due to the deliberate omission of cases in which the third or subsequent birth was either a multiple birth, a retarded person, or an infant death. One example may suffice to illustrate this point. Examination of the data for the cohort 1918-27 shows that 247 families had more than two children; yet only 244 were included in the next comparison. Of the 157 having more than three children, only 152 qualified for inclusion in the third comparison. Hence in the first case three were omitted, and in the next case five were omitted.
By partitioning the total chi-square value for the dichotomy "Stop vs. Increase" by four combinations of sexes among the first two offspring, it is possible to examine three orthogonal comparisons. In addition to testing the "Same vs. Different" dichotomy among combinations, one may test two further hypotheses: (1) that there is no difference in proportion increasing when the first two were both male (BB) as compared with both females (GG); and (2) that in families having both sexes represented in the first two, the

proportion increasing was no different whether the male was the first-born (BG) or the female was the first (GB). The data in Table 6 show a difference under Hypothesis 1 for the second and fourth cohorts, reaching a low level of probability (p = 0.034) only for the most recent (fourth) cohort. In this latter case, the difference could be interpreted as "desire for a girl." We fail to reject Hypothesis 2 for any of the cohorts studied; the inference is that there is no influence of order of the first two upon increasing the number of offspring.
Omitting the first cohort (Cl) solely because of its small sample size (N = 75) leads to comparisons among the remaining three, which may be thought of as three generations of families. These three are designated C2, C3, and C4 in Table 7, a multiple chi-square analysis. The hypothesis of independence of cohort and outcome is rejected (p = 0.0080). This low probability value for the overall comparison is attributable to the fact that the most recent cohort (C4) is different in the portion increasing across all combinations of the sex of the first two (p = 0.0031). This difference is also reflected in the comparison of mean family size alluded to above

Complete information for calculating the Hollingshead Two-Factor Index of Social Position was available for 272 families (see Table 2); however, five of these

families were omitted from Table 8 because there were twins as first or second births. In the comparison of proportion of families increasing for "Same vs. Different," examination of the data for the middle and lower classes shows a suggestive reversal of preference. Insofar as these proportions indicate a "concern" about the sex composition of the family, it appears that whereas there is no significant effect

shows a marked difference in proportion

The speculation that parents who intend to limit their family size are more concerned about the sex composition of their offspring is invited by this kind of data, but the evidence of studies done to date is contradictory. Ayala and Falk (1971), for example, failed to find any influence of the sex of the two prior children upon increase of family size in a group of families having a mean family size of 3.09 children. In all the above cases, the families studied had two or more children, but as the data of Tables 2 and 3 show, the decline in mean family size for those with two or more children parallels that for the total adult sample in each case. This decline is accompanied by an increase in the proportion of nonreproducing adults from 0.10 (1843-67) through 0.1S (1869-92) to 0.19 (18931917). These factors parallel the general experience of U.S.' women for this time period (Campbell, 1973). The fourth

increasing after four children of the same sex, even though the sample size is too small for the comparison to reach statistical significance. In contrast, the next cohort (1868-92) shows the effect after two children, but not after three or four. The 1893-1917 cohort shows a difference in proportion increasing after three children, but in the opposite direction and only at p = 0.09; this same direction of difference is also seen at this point in the two earlier cohorts. The most recent group, which is probably comparable in span of reproduction to the other American studies, shows a consistent and increasing difference in proportion after the second, third, and fourth. The probabilities stated in this table are all from Fisher's Exact Test and are appropriate for one-tailed tests of hypotheses; their values are consistent with but are not expected to be identical to the chi-square values of Table 6, since chisquare is two-tailed.

cohort shows a rise in mean family size for the 73 families ascertained in the present investigation (Table 3), and this too is similar to the reproductive behavior of the general population. These are the parents who contributed to the "baby boom" after World War II.

Returning to the consideration of the sex of the first two children, the partition of the total chi-square values into single degree-of-freedom contrasts is shown in Table 6. While generalization of these results is limited due to the small number of families observed, these data show some

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The observed data from five earlier studies and the present investigation of the influence of the sex combinations ofprior children upon the ultimate (or completed) number ofchildren in the family are presented. Data from all sources are discussed in terms of three measures of association: the corrected odds ratio (o')> the natural logarithm of this ratio (Z,*), and the phi coefficient (<£) or fourfold point correlation.
