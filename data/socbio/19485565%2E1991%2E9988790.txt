ABSTRACT: Published infant mortality rates (IMR's) for Mexican-American populations frequently are lower than expected given the socioeconomic status (SES) of these populations. It has been speculated that this is due to bias or incompleteness in Mexican-American vital statistics. In this paper an extensive genealogical data base constructed from Catholic church records and civil records for the border city of Laredo, Texas is used to study this problem. The infant mortality probabilities (IMP's) since 1950 are compared to conventional IMR's, both based strictly on the population at risk defined by baptisms, in which the deaths are a proper subset of the denominator, and these are compared with IMR's calculated in the usual way from aggregate civil records of births and infant deaths for Laredo. We find that when these data are used, the IMR's for the most recent years are about twice the conventional rates computed from registered vital statistics.

Infant mortality rates (IMR's) often are considered to be indicators of the socioeconomic wellbeing of populations. In the United States, risk of infant death has always been highest among minority and economically disadvantaged populations (Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973; Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977; Stockwell et al., 1978; NCHS, 1984). This finding has been attributed to such risk factors as inadequate pre- and post-natal medical care, high parity, inadequate nutrition, higher incidence of high risk adolescent pregnancies, poor familial support, increased exposure to infectious diseases--factors which are most prevalent in populations of low socioeconomic status (SES) (see Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973; Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977, for example). Yet despite the apparently clear relationship between infant mortality rates and SES, the infant mortality rates reported for Mexican-American populations are

puzzlingly low (Teller and Clyburn, 1974; Markides and Hazuda, 1980; Eberstein and Pol, 1982; Gee et al., 1976; Selby et al., 1984; Griner-Powell and Streck, 1982; Palloni, 1978; Williams et al., 1986).
By most measures, MexicanAmerican populations are on the low end of the socioeconomic scale, particularly along the U.S.-Mexico border (U.S. Census of the Population, 1970, 1980). However, IMR's in these groups consistently are markedly lower than those in other populations of similar socioeconomic status and, indeed, sometimes even lower than those of U.S. white groups (for example, Markides and Hazuda, 1980; Teller and Clyburn, 1974). It is not surprising, then, that many investigators treat these rates with skepticism and either question the validity of official vital statistics for Hispanics (Markides and Hazuda, 1980; Selby et al., 1984; Teller and Clyburn, 1974), or doubt a contin-

ued association between infant mortality and SES (Stockwell et al., 1978), or suggest that the favorable measures may be due to "migration selection," the possibility that immigrants from Mexico are healthier than nonmigrants and so produce healthier infants (Markides and Hazuda, 1980). Understanding possible biases, and developing better estimates, can have important consequences for health planning in this group and for our understanding of the demography of MexicanAmericans.
Several possible sources of error have been suggested to explain why Hispanic IMR's may be spuriously low, including the miscoding of race on birth and/or death records (Rogers, 1989), underreporting of births and deaths of infants delivered by lay birth attendants or born to Mexicans illegally in the United States, or overestimation of the number of births to Mexican-Americans because of the large number of births in South Texas to nonresidents, primarily Mexican nationals who travel to the United States to give birth and return to Mexico shortly thereafter (Teller and Clyburn, 1974;Selbyetal., 1984).
In this paper we report on the infant mortality experience of a sample of seven birth cohorts from 1950 to 1977 for the Mexican-American border city of Laredo, Texas. We believe these figures to be free of these particular sources of bias because we have not used birth certificates to determine the population at risk nor have we relied on coded ethnicity.
Our source of data is the extensive genealogies we have reconstructed from all of the Catholic baptismal and marriage records and the civil death

records registered in Laredo between about 1850 and 1977. We also have civil birth records and aggregate birth statistics from 1910 to the present. In this paper we compare three measures of infant risk. First, we have computed infant mortality rates from public vital statistics records. Second, for the seven selected years, we have computed the IMR using total births determined from baptisms as the denominator and linked infant death records as the numerator. Finally, we have computed the infant mortality probability (IMP), that is, the probability that an infant born in a year will die before reaching its first birthday. A comparison of these different measures of infant death permits us to estimate the extent of error in published infant mortality rates which apparently is due to the use of recorded births to estimate the population at risk. The IMR's for Laredo are also compared with IMR's for U.S. whites and U.S. nonwhites for this century.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SOURCE OF DATA
The city of Laredo lies on the U.S. border with Mexico along the Rio Grande in South Texas. Laredo was part of Mexico until 1846 and has remained predominantly MexicanAmerican (most recently, 90 to 95 per cent, according to the U.S. censuses of 1970 and 1980) and Catholic, and by most measures, generally of low socioeconomic status (U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 1970, 1980). Data for this study are derived from genealogies we have reconstructed from Catholic Church and

civil vital records for the city of Laredo. We have computerized all baptismal and marriage records from the 12 Catholic parishes in Laredo from the 1850's through 1977, and all Laredo death records from the beginning of registration at the end of the nineteenth century through 1988. The genealogies have been supplemented by morbidity data from a sample of hospital records from admissions occurring between 1910 and 1980.
The construction and genetic analysis of the data base have been described elsewhere (Buchanan et al., 1982; Buchanan et al., 1984; Norton, 1981; Schwartz et al., 1984; Schwartz et al., 1985). The data base includes any Laredoan for whom record of at least one of six possible vital events was found: either his or her own baptism, marriage or death, or the baptism, marriage or death of a child on which he or she was listed as parent. For computer record linkage purposes we created a birth record for every individual for whom we knew date of birth. For about 98 per cent of the people in the data base, this information was derived from the baptismal record, but about 2 per cent of the birth records were created from information on a marriage or death record. Individual vital histories were reconstructed by linking birth and marriage records (and death records, if deceased) which had matching names and dates. Individuals were then linked into nuclear and extended families when relatives were found, again identified by name and date matching. After matching records were identified by the computer algorithm, the links were all verified by hand. Because the primary purpose for which this data base was constructed was the study of ge-

netic disease, the matching criteria were very stringent. When necessary, rather than reconstructing families erroneously, ambiguous matches were left unmade. The data base includes about 254,000 individuals and about 83,000 nuclear families.
For several reasons, we have made no attempt to exclude non-Hispanics from the data base. First, Laredo is so ethnically homogeneous that the effort to identify the approximately 5 per cent of the population that is nonHispanic would have been too expensive for the small gain. More importantly, identification of Hispanics using a list of Hispanic surnames, as is sometimes done, would introduce some degree of classification error and ambiguity itself. Therefore, we have done no classification of ethnicity and assume that the data base represents a Mexican-American population as cleanly as could be done with current formulae for coding Hispanic ethnicity.
STATISTICAL METHODS
The standard method of computing the infant mortality rate is the number of deaths to infants less than one year of age registered in calendar year i, Dt, divided by the number of births registered during the same year, Z?,:

IMR =

(1)

(Shryock and Siegel, 1971). For this study, we have applied this equation in three different ways. First, we used registered birth and death records for Laredo to compute the IMR as in Equation (1). Second, we computed IMR's strictly from the data base using total baptisms in a given year for B, and total linked deaths recorded in the

same year for D,. Finally, we computed true cohort IMP's directly; that is, where D, is the number of deaths occurring to the B, baptized infants (identified individually by record linkage from the death certificates) before they reach their first birthday ( x 1000), whether occurring in year / or year / + 1.
Cohort IMP's, whether defined on the basis of all infants born or all infants who die in a given year, are the most intuitively meaningful measure of infant risk, but they usually cannot be constructed easily. While methods exist to estimate the IMR from the IMP, there is always some uncertainty in this approximation due to the rapidly changing nature of the instantaneous risk of death during the first year of post-natal life (e.g., Elandt-Johnson and Johnson, 1980; Shryock and Siegel, 1971). In this case we have both measures directly. Although the IMP is a more meaningful measure, we include IMR's for Laredo so that Laredo rates can be readily compared with IMR's from other populations.
Stillbirths are sometimes baptized in Catholic hospitals, including the hospital in Laredo. To ascertain only liveborn infants, therefore, cause of death for infants who died on their birthday was used to determine whether the infant was liveborn or stillborn. The resulting stillbirth rates were 6 to 7 per thousand per year, which is close to stillbirth rates reported for other populations (NCHS, 1984). (Removing these infants from both the numerator and denominator had the effect of raising the IMP's by about 0.1 or 0.2 per 1000, so that even complete precision in this determination would have had minimal effect.)

RESULTS
INFANT MORTALITY PROBABILITIES
AND RATES
Laredo IMP's and IMR's for the period from 1950 through 1977 are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1, along with comparable U.S. white and nonwhite IMR's from 1950 through 1977.
The IMR's for U.S. whites, nonwhites, and for Laredo are plotted in Figure 2. In 1950, the IMR in Laredo was 69.3 per 1,000 live births; by 1977, the rate had fallen to 25.5, a 63 per cent decline in 27 years.
IMR's FROM VITAL STATISTICS
vs. CHURCH RECORDS
Table 1 shows the IMR's estimated from registered births and deaths in Laredo compared to IMR's calculated from the data base. For the first half of this century, it is clear that estimates from vital statistics are much too high, presumably because of underreporting of births in a population in which many births occurred in private dwellings. After the 1960's, however, the number of registered births is much higher than the total births for which we have evidence in the baptismal records, and the IMR's are quite low. This suggests that births to transient parents are being recorded in significant numbers. Compared with the conventional infant mortality rates we have presented here, the 1970 figure is a 42 per cent underestimate, and the 1977 figure is a 54 per cent underestimate of infant mortality in Laredo.
Laredo infant mortality rates constructed from baptisms are very close to the U.S. nonwhite infant mortality rates, which, given the generally low SES of the population of Laredo, is

more in line with what is expected than are the IMR's from registered births.
DISCUSSION
This study differs from most studies of Mexican-American infant mortality in that we are able, through record linkage, to follow true cohorts and to compute the actual probability of death during infancy rather than to estimate the risk of death as the infant mortality rate. The critical issue is not the numerical difference between these two quantities but the fact that rates computed from public vital statistics involve numerators that are not proper subsets of the denominators, as well as other problems of data uncertainty.
The results of this study suggest that

current Hispanic infant mortality rates based on vital statistics are indeed biased downward, and perhaps increasingly so. The numbers we use here are not subject to the usual sources of error that can affect the accuracy of vital rates for Hispanic populations, including inconsistent classification of ethnicity between births and deaths, overestimation of the population at risk of infant death due to U.S. registration of births to residents of Mexico, or underregistration of infants born to Mexicans in the country illegally. It has often been suggested that these problems bias the IMR's downward, but the extent of such bias has been difficult to quantify. Although the use of baptismal records to represent the population at risk may introduce a different set of problems, discussed below, the

by public health policy developers. Accuracy in assessing health service needs is especially important in the Hispanic population of the southern tier of U.S. states, because this population is one of the poorest in the nation. In most populations in developed countries, the number of registered births is a valid indicator of the number of infants at risk of death in a defined population. For Mexican nationals, especially along the U.S.-Mexico border, however, the possibility of acquiring a U.S. birth certificate for an infant entices many women to cross into the United States to give birth, so that the number of births registered in the cities on the U.S. side of the border is much higher than the number of infants born to residents of those cities.
Thus, researchers and public health

officials interested in accurate estimates of infant mortality in these areas must either estimate and subtract the number of births to Mexican nationals (using residence information on hospital records, for instance), or find an alternate source for the estimation of the number of births in the community. Certainly, it is not always practical to estimate Hispanic IMR's or IMP's from church records, but it may be possible to use direct computer record linkage to do so in many areas. Given the controversy over the accuracy of Hispanic infant mortality rates, the rates we offer here may be useful in determining whether more effort should be expended to correct Hispanic birth statistics, particularly for border areas, and whether rates from vital statistics are credible enough to use as a basis for
