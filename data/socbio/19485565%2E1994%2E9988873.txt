ABSTRACT: Over the period 1969-86, Mauritian mortality declined rapidly, accompanied by substantial change in its age pattern of mortality and cause-of-death structure. Using cause-ofdeath data for this period, this paper studies the influence of cause-of-death structure on age patterns of mortality. Infectious and parasitic diseases had marked influence on age patterns of mortality for young Mauritian males, while circulatory causes of death influenced the age pattern of mortality for older Mauritian males. For females, their unique age pattern of mortality remained unique, largely because of the uniform and smooth change in cause-of-death structure.

Mauritius is a small island of approximately 720 square miles situated in the Indian Ocean, 500 miles east of Madagascar and some 1,000 miles from the southeast coast of Africa. In 1987, the population was about one million, made up of three broad population groups: the Indo-Mauritians, the SinoMauritians, and the "General Population." The Indo-Mauritians, comprised of immigrants from India and their descendants, make up about 66 per cent of the population, while the Sino-Mauritians, comprised of immigrants from China and their descendants make up about 3 per cent. The remaining population, about 31 per cent, is known as the "General Population," made up of persons of European or African or mixed descent.
The Island of Mauritius has experienced one of the most spectacular declines in mortality in the Third World, yet does not receive as much attention as states like Kerala (India) or Sri Lanka. In four decades, from 1942-46 to 1982-84, life expectancy at birth in

Mauritius increased from 32.8 to 64.38 years for males and from 33.8 to 71.23 years for females. This sharp decline in mortality was accompanied by a drastic shift in cause of death structure. This paper aims to describe the influence that this change in cause-of-death structure had on the age patterns of mortality. The study period extends from 1969 to 1986, a period during which Mauritian mortality experienced transitional changes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data used for the analysis was obtained from censuses and from vital statistics on causes of death. In Mauritius, data on death and other vital statistics is collected by the Registrar General's Department, which by 1982 maintained 48 Civil Status Offices located throughout the country. Mauritius is known to have a tradition of very good birth and death registration statistics as well as censuses. According to the UN (1982, p. 2):

Research and evaluation by national and international organizations have shown that recent censuses in Mauritius have been quite accurate . . . Civil registration of vital events is compulsory and in the last few decades, with the exception of marriages, has been nearly complete.
In the case of mortality, the completeness of death registration has been confirmed again using an independent analytic technique. Using the technique of Bennet and Horiuchi (1981), Bah (1992a) estimated that for the intercensal period 1972-83, death registration for males was 100 per cent complete while for females it was 98.6 per cent complete. While registration of vital events has been compulsory for several decades, medical certification of causes of death only became compulsory for all districts in 1982 (CSO, 1988). The statistics of causes of death from Mauritius are submitted to the data bank of WHO in Geneva from which the data set used in this study was obtained.
The causes of death in that data bank are classified according to the code of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Over the period under study, two versions of the International Classification of Diseases were used; the eighth revision of the ICD (ICD-8), from 1969-80; and the ninth revision (ICD-9), from 1981 to 1986. As those classifications were very detailed, it was necessary to regroup the causes of death into meaningful categories for subsequent analysis. Following the lead of previous studies in cause-of-death analysis, I used eleven groups of causes in the analysis, including all causes combined and the residual group of all other causes, "all others." The final list and their equivalent

codes in ICD-8 and ICD-9 are given in Table 1. For each of these eleven groups of causes, the age-standardized cause-specific death rate was computed separately for gender for each year. The unit of analysis used was one year. Hence, for the period extending from 1969 to 1986, the total number of data points used in the analysis, by gender, was 18. In analyzing a long-term series of cause-of-death data, the problem of change in ICD is often encountered. In such a situation, the problems of comparability caused by the revisions of the ICD are minimized by grouping the causes of death into large categories as has been done in this case.
To describe the influence of causeof-death structure on age patterns of mortality, the method employed is to relate two measurable quantities, one reflecting causes of death and the other reflecting age patterns of mortality. According to Preston (1976), the two quantities which are measurable and which are also mathematically related are the life table death rate or its equivalent measure, log(lx+n/lx), and the age-standardized cause-specific death rate for cause /, ASCDR1'. In Preston's work analyzing the impact of cause-ofdeath structure on age patterns of mortality, he used these two quantities together in a multiple regression model, with log(lx+n/lx) as the dependent variable. In this analysis, the regression methodology has been modified slightly. Instead of using a multiple regression model with all the groups of causes of death serving as independent variables, I attempted to remove the effect of multicollinearity among the causes. Thus, several "diagnostic" techniques were added before the application of a multiple regression

model. This extra step was necessary to overcome the problems of multicollinearity whose effect is much greater when dealing with small sample sizes such as the case in the present study.
RESULTS
Detailed description of the trend in causes of death can be found in Bah (1992a and 19926), while that of age patterns of mortality can be found in Bah and Teklu (1992). The agestandardized crude death rates have been plotted in Figures 1 and 2 for males and females, respectively.
From Figure 1, four stages can be identified from the trend of standardized death rates for males for all causes combined. The period 1969-74 witnessed slight fluctuations, but close to a mean level. The period 1975-77 witnessed a rapid rise to a plateau level

after which the rates returned again to the pre-1974 level over the period 1980-82. The period 1983-86 saw a rapid decline to new low levels.
For females, Figure 2 shows a steadier decline. For the period 197073, the rates were almost constant, followed by a steady decline which was sustained until 1984 when the lowest level was reached. There has been a slow rise in the rates after 1984. Upon further analysis of the mortality by causes, Bah (19926) summarizes the main findings below:
The trend of the age-standardized cause-specific death rates shows that changes take place in the magnitude of the rate as well as in the ranking. A few of the causes, like diseases of the circulatory system, nutritional disorders, and digestive system show an increase, while others, such as infectious diseases, respiratory causes, and "all oth-

ers," show a decline. Others, like neoplasms, external causes of injury and poisoning, and congenital malformations, show little change.
In summary, during the period under study, the changes in rank of various causes can be classed into three groups. First are those causes which have hardly changed rank for either gender. These causes include external causes of injury, diseases of the digestive system, and diseases due to pregnancy and puerperium. Second are those causes which changed rank by one. These causes include respiratory diseases. Last, there are those causes which changed by more than one rank. These causes include neoplasm, for females, nutritional disorders for females, and "all other causes," also for

females. Changes in rank for more than one cause occur more often for females than for males.
Of the different causes of death, the ones that show a clear declining trend for both genders are infectious diseases and "all others." The causes that show a clear rising trend for both genders are diseases of the circulatory system. For the rest of the causes, there were fluctuations of differing magnitudes. The trends of some causes rise to peaks and then decline sharply, while for others the trends were almost constant.
Figure 3 and 4 show the age patterns of mortality for six different years, namely, 1969, 1973, 1976,1980, 1983, and 1986. For males, Figure 3 shows a U-shaped curve which gradually changes to a J-shaped curve. The

figure shows changes occurring in ages below 5 and in ages above 45. For the ages 5-45, there have not been many changes. For ages below one, there has been a uniform decline in the rates, from 799.4 per 100,000 in 1969 to 122.8 in 1986--a remarkable reduction of 551 per cent. For ages 1-4, there has been a decline, but a less spectacular one. For ages above 45, the graph is marked by cross-overs. There was an increase in male mortality in 1976 and a slight increase in male mortality in 1986.
For females, Figure 4 is also U-shaped, but becomes less so over time. Uniform decline in the rates is observed on the graph for ages below 5 and for ages above 45. There are, however, fewer cross-overs of the curves in the higher ages than there are for

males. Between ages 60 and 70, the curves are clustered together and cannot be separated from each other, which shows the uniformity and the slow pace of mortality decline in the higher age groups.
As for the main results of the present study, Table 2 shows the regression of an age-specific mortality measure (log (npx)) with time. The ages covered infants and children, adults and the elderly. For males, only the infant and child ages (below age 10) show uniform decline with time. For adult ages above age 20, the R2 was very low suggesting that the decline in mortality, if present at all, could not be linear.
From Table 3, one observes that the correlations with time for these three age groups are all significant and lie

above 0.7. The beta value is highest for age 0-1, followed by age group 1-4 and then age group 5-9. For females, however, the correlations with time for all age groups are significant, except for the older ages above 60. The beta values for all the age groups below 60 lie above 0.8, being highest for the age group 20-39. This finding is consistent with previous findings that over the period 1969-85, mortality declined uniformly for females for almost all ages, while for males only the infant and child ages showed secular decline (Bah, 1987).
Table 4 shows the regression of standardized cause-specific death rates with time. The causes that showed a uniform decline with time were infectious diseases (INF), respiratory diseases (RES), and "others" (OTH) for

both males and females. The causes of death which showed a uniform rise with time were disease of the circulatory system (CIR) for both genders and diseases of the digestive system (DIG) for males. With the exception of OTH, the diseases which show a uniform decline are those that respond easily to intervention efforts. These have been dubbed "diseases of underdevelopment." On the other hand, those causes which show an increase with time are those that increase along with development and which have been dubbed "diseases of development."
To confirm this finding, correlations were run among the different causes as shown in Table 5. For males, the causes of death showing a high positive association are: INF and OTH, RES

and OTH, DIG and CIR and to some extent CIR and NEO. Here one can see the pairing between diseases belonging to the same group. This relationship is even more significant in the case of females.
Because of the high collinearity among the causes of death, multiple correlation regression cannot be applied on all the causes together. Some adjustments need to be made. Several options are possible. First, the sample size could be increased, an option not viable in this case. Second, ridge regression could be applied. Third, factor analysis could be done, followed by multiple regression. Here, the third option is used, partly for expediency, and partly because it does not involve manipulation of data but rather assists the researcher in the selection of vari-

ables for inclusion in the regression model.
In the first stage of resolving the multicollinearity problem, I employed factor analysis. Oblique rotation of the Mauritian male data yielded a simple structure shown in Table 6. The table shows three factors underlying the cause-of-death data. The causes of death loading heavily on the first factor are NEO and CIR. The first factor reflects causes with a rising trend. The causes loading heavily on the second factor are INF, RES and OTH. The second factor reflects the declining causes of death. The causes loading heavily on the third factor are NU, DIG, CON and INJ. The third factor reflects the "non-directional" causes of death which show more fluctuation, rather than showing any clear rising or

"See Table 1 for meaning of causes-of-death categories.

Since studies in Mauritian mortality have shown that male mortality increased during the 1970's, this information was included in the analysis to see how it would help to improve the regression modeling. Since the breaking point for changes in the cause-of-death structure in Mauritius was found to be around 1978 (Bah, 19926), the data were then split into two subsets: pre1978 and post-1978. The results of the same regression model is shown in Tables 7B and 7C. Table 7B, for pre1978, shows marked improvement in R2 over that in Table 7A for the adult ages between 20 and 70. For these ages, the highest beta values occur for CIR, and they are all negative. For these ages, increase in deaths due to CIR caused marked decline in survivorship. For post-1978, the results of the regression model is given in Table 7C. Again, as in Table 7B, the marked improvement in the R2 occurred for adult ages above 20. For these ages, the cause with the highest beta coefficient is INJ. In the age 70-80 group, the cause with the highest beta is CIR, and the R2 for the model at this stage is very high at 0.94.

From Table 8A it can be seen that for males, the regression model for the three other causes--NEO, INF, and INJ--is adequate for ages less than 20. For these ages, the table shows that declines in the rates of INF is accompanied by increase in survivorship. The effects of INJ and NEO are hardly significant.
As was done above for the first set of causes, the male data were also split in two--pre-1978 and post-1978--and the same regression model (with NEO, INF, and INJ) was run on both data sets. The results are shown in Tables 8B and 8C. Table 8B and Table 8C show marked improvement in R2 over Table 8A for ages under 20. For these ages, the result obtained is still the same, namely, that the greatest effect on the age pattern was from INF.
In the case of females, it was not necessary to split the data because there were no natural breaks in cause of death structure as was the case for males. The change in cause of death structure was smooth over the period of study. The results of the regression models using the two different sets of causes of death are given in Tables 9 and 10.
From these tables, we see that the causes having the most effect on the age pattern of mortality for females are CIR and INF and, to a lesser extent, RES. The causes INF and RES had their greatest effect for ages below 20, while CIR had its greatest effect for adult ages above 20.
DISCUSSION
The effect of cause structure on age pattern has not been uniform either in the intensity or in the type of causes.

ages (above 20). However, the crucial changes in male age patterns of mortality arose as a result of changes in infant and child mortality about 1978. These changes came about mostly be-

cause of drastic decline in infectious and parasitic diseases, INF and respiratory diseases, RES. Because of the rapid decline in these causes of death, the age pattern of childhood mortality

which was similar to the South Asian pattern prior to 1978, deviated strongly from that pattern after 1978.
As young age mortality was undergoing changes, old age mortality was also simultaneously undergoing opposite changes. Mortality was experiencing a slow-down in decline due to the rise in CIR. The effect of CIR on the adult age pattern of mortality was higher pre-1978 than post-1978. The Far Eastern pattern of mortality is one characterized by high old-age mortality relative to younger ages. This paper has shown that the cause of death which contributed the most to making the Mauritian male age pattern of mortality resemble the Far Eastern pattern is that of CIR.
For the female population, none of the Coale and Demeny (1966) or the New United Nations (1983) families of model life tables adequately described the age pattern of mortality. Its mortality pattern was found to be rather unique. The closest that any of the model life tables came to being similar to Mauritian females is the Far Eastern pattern (Bah and Teklu, 1992). The findings from this study suggest that it was the uniform change in the female cause-of-death structure that helped to maintain this uniqueness in the female age pattern of mortality.
CONCLUSION
Cause-of-death structure was found to have influenced age patterns of mortality more in the case of males than females. For both males and females, the most prominent causes of death affecting age pattern of mortality were infectious and parasitic diseases (INF)

and circulatory causes of death (CIR). Under the period of study, INF showed a declining trend while CIR showed a largely rising trend. The greatest effect of INF on age pattern of mortality was on the young ages below 20. The rapid decline in INF caused the male age pattern of mortality in the young ages to change from one resembling the U.N. South Asian Pattern prior to 1978 to one different from it after 1978. For males, the increase in CIR contributed to relatively high adult mortality which helped the age pattern of adult mortality to continue resembling the U.N. Far Eastern Pattern. For females, the unique age pattern of mortality (different from all Coale-Demeny or United Nations model life tables) continued the same largely because of the very uniform and smooth change in cause-of-death structure.
Part of the explanation why Mauritius, with its low mortality, would have infectious and parasitic diseases as the most important determinant of age patterns of mortality has to do with the transitional phase in Mauritian mortality over the course of the study period. The early seventies saw Mauritian mortality undergoing a transition from the second to the third stages of its epidemiologic transition. During the study period, infectious diseases were reduced markedly, losing their first position to circulatory causes of death, but nevertheless still remained important causes of death.
There are two major implications we can identify from this study.
(1)--It increases our understanding of the age patterns of mortality. The study of age patterns of mortality is a serious endeavour in mortality research. Such

228 Bah Social Biology

efforts have resulted in the compilation of various model life tables such as those of the United Nations, Coale and Demeny, etc. More specifically, in the case of Maritius, the study has offered explanations on why the age pattern of mortality resembled certain model life tables and why it differed from such tables later.
(2)--Theories of mortality decline
are being formulated without much idea
about the mechanism of the impact of
the cause-of-death structure on age pat-
tern of mortality and subsequently on
mortality trends. For example, one the-
ory of mortality decline argues that mor-
tality decline is not cause-specific, i.e.,
the elimination of certain causes would
not affect the trend in mortality (Tur-
shen, 1989). From this study, we see
how specific causes helped change the

mortality trend and age structure. This finding would suggest that such theories, even if found to be valid elsewhere, cannot be generalized for all countries, at least not in the case of Mauritius. This finding has direct relevance in the development of techniques for the indirect estimation of demographic parameters and also in shaping health policies.
