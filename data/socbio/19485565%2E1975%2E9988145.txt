ously considers all three of these measures of socioeconomic standing for the wide range of ages represented in the Tecumseh sample (4-92) has been reported.
The results of previous studies have been varied. Marks (1967) summarizes quite well the work published up to 1967 pertaining to socioeconomic effects. The relevant findings may be stated briefly. In a study of 1,400 Chicago blacks (Berkson et al., 1960), no statistically significant difference in serum cholesterol levels between bluecollar and white-collar workers was found. Similarly, in a Chicago utility company study (Berkson et al., 1960) and in a survey of railroad employees (Taylor et al., 1966) in the northwest and midwestern United States, serum cholesterol level was not found to be statistically related to an occupational identification.
In contrast, a number of investigations have provided data supporting a relationship between some measure of socioeconomic status and serum cholesterol. A comparison of 147 officers and 121 enlisted men in the Chinese army, aged 30 to 59, (Alexander et al., 1965) showed the officers to have significantly greater serum cholesterol levels. Evaluation of data collected from 288 Guatemalan male and female school children, aged 7 to 12, showed that children of higher income parents had higher serum cholesterol than children of lower income parents (Scrimshaw et al., 1965). Studies of 75 healthy individuals and 75 coronary cases (Chattopadhaya et al., 1966) and 363 males (Mathur et al., 1959) in India found that serum cholesterol increased with the increase in socioeconomic status. An investigation by Komachi et al. (1971) of 8,587 Japanese males, aged 40 to 69, observed that urban executives and physicians had higher average serum cholesterol and greater incidence of hypercholesterolemia than urban manual or clerical workers or rural and semi-rural inhabitants.

Other research has turned up different relationships between indicators of socioeconomic status and serum cholesterol in different age groups. In Evans County, Georgia, white males in "high" social classes had significantly greater serum cholesterol than those in "low" social classes after age 45 but not before (McDonough et al., 1965). White-collar workers in New Zealand had higher serum cholesterol before age 40 than industrial workers but not after (Hunter, 1963). Glazunov et al. (1964) found that a sample of Moscow clerks had higher serum cholesterol than factory workers for those 50 to 59 years old but not for those 40 to 49 years old; and a comparison by Pell and D'Alonzo (1961) of 1,585 "top" executives, "lower" executives, and white-collar nonexecutives of duPont in Delaware showed that serum cholesterol increased with position for those subjects between 40 and 49 years of age, while there was no significant difference in serum cholesterol between the three groups for those subjects aged 50 to 64.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
From 1959 to 1970 the Tecumseh Community Health Study collected data with the intent of defining predictors of health and disease in a total community. Our data set comes from this study. It consists of 14,310 serum cholesterol observations, representing one or two measurements on each of 4,619 males and 4,730 females. Age was recorded with each observation. Occupation, educational class, and the income of the family unit within which an individual resided were also recorded. Individuals who had a cholesterol measurement but who did not have one of the socioeconomic variables recorded were placed in a separate category (Table 1) for that variable. These data were collected in two "rounds," the first from 1959 to 1960 and the second from 1963 to 1966. Serum cholesterol was de-

termined in both rounds for 2,457 males and 2,504 females, while the remaining individuals had a measurement in only one round. Serum cholesterol was determined in both rounds by the procedure of Abell et al. (1952).
It was established by Sing et al. (1975) that the most reasonable method of dealing with the serum cholesterol data wasto take the natural logarithm of each observation. Then, for each sex and round separately, ln-cholesterol was fit to age (measured in months) by a third-order polynomial; after that, each ln-cholesterol value was adjusted for age by the appropriate polynomial. If a person was measured in only one round, this measurement became his adjusted ln-cholesterol value; if he was measured in both rounds, the two values obtained were averaged to arrive at hisfinal adjusted value.
The socioeconomic variables considered here were obtained by interview. They are: (1) combined income of all members, 18 or more years of age, of the respondent's family living in the same household in the twelve months prior to the interview; (2) the respondent's occupation; and (3) the highest level of education that he attained if he was 18 years of age or older. The codes for and the numbers of individuals in each of the classes for each of these three variables are given in Table 1. Whenever an individual's occupation, his educational class, or the income of his family unit were

not available, he was assigned to a "not available" class. Individuals who were under 18 years of age were considered to belong to a separate educational class. If an individual participated in both rounds, he was assigned for each socioeconomic variable the code for Round II, unless his code in Round II was "not available," in which case he was assigned his code for Round I.
Having ascertained the values of the variables of interest for all subjects, we examined by analysis-of-variance techniques the adjusted In-cholesterol values for variation attributable to different classes of education, occupation, and income. Due to the unbalanced structure of the problem (number of observations in each combination of the three indicators not being equal), it was not feasible to examine all three socioeconomic variables simultaneously in a three-way analysis.
To examine the variation removed from the data by accounting for the combination of education, occupation, and income, we followed a sequential analysis of variance procedure. On the basis of the analysis of In-cholesterol completed on education, each person's adjusted In-cholesterol value was readjusted by subtracting from it the "effect" (deviation of the class mean Incholesterol from the grand mean of all In-cholesterol values) of his education class; and another analysis of variance was done on occupation using these newly-adjusted In-cholesterol values. Similarly, an adjustment was made for occupation followed by an analysis of variance of the new values on income. In this way, a test for the effect of all three socioeconomic indicators taken together on serum cholesterol variation can be made on the basis of a "socioeconomic status sum of squares," which is the sum of three sums of squares: those accountable by differences (1) among education classes, (2) among occupation classes

after adjustment for education, and (3) among income classes after adjustment for education and occupation.
In addition, one-way analyses of variance of In-cholesterol were carried out separately on education, occupation, and income variables. In these analyses, we estimated the mean values of each class for a variable, ignoring the other two variables, and considered the F-statistic as a test of the hypotheses of equality of the class means. We also searched for possible interactions between pairs of the socioeconomic variables. To measure and test for an effect of interaction between education and occupation on serum cholesterol, for example, we considered the difference between the sum of squares among education classes within occupation classes and the sum of squares among education classes over all the data, ignoring the occupation class designation. At the same time, we examined the F-tests and effects for the conditional (as described in the previous paragraph) analyses of variance.
RESULTS
Tables 2 and 3 present evidence that variation in serum cholesterol may be related to socioeconomic status (as indicated by class of education, occupation, and income taken together) in males but not in females. The test for effects of socioeconomic status is significant at the 0.001 level for males (Part A in Table 2), but it is not significant at 0.10 for females (Part A in Table 3). However, an assumption on which the test is based is violated and must be considered to evaluate this outcome properly. Since some subjects were measured in two rounds and the others only in one round, the error variances of the Incholesterol measurements considered in Part A in Tables 2 and 3 are not the same for each individual. Because of this fact, our estimates of error variance (and hence,

To get some measure of what this bias might be, we analyzed each round of data separately. In this case, the "residual" observation variances are all based on one measurement and the F-statistic will not be subject to the aforementioned bias.
The results for each round are presented in Part B in Tables 2 and 3 for comparison with the analysis of the pooled data. In each round, for males, the test of the socioeconomic status effects is still significant at the 0.001 level of probability; for females, the test is not significant at 0.10 in Round I and significant at 0.05 in Round II. The result for females is not disturbing, in light of the fact that in Round II only 13 of the

3,841 are coded with occupations, the rest being "not available." One occupation class (with only one subject) accounts for onethird of the total sum of squares due to socioeconomic status in Round II. Of the total variation in the age-round-replicateadjusted ln-cholesterol data, socioeconomic indicators account for 1.80 per cent in males and 0.S7 per cent in females; of the total variation in the ln-cholesterol data unadjusted for any other variables, socioeconomic indicators account for 0.76 per cent in males and 0.23 per cent in females.
As with the test of socioeconomic status effects taken together, the separate tests for differences among classes for each of the socioeconomic variables were significant for males but not females (Part A in Tables 2 and 3). The inference about occupation and income from the pooled data does not

change when each round is analyzed separately (Part B in Tables 2 and 3). There is an inconsistency between rounds for education, as we will note below.
The socioeconomic classes which actually provided no information about education (Classes 1 and 2), occupation (Class 1), or income (Class 1) were included in the analysis to maintain the sample and will be used along with all other classes to adjust the data to reduce its variation in preparation for further analyses. With the no-information classes removed from the analyses, the inferences which are drawn from Tables 2 and 3 are essentially unchanged. For males, deviations among occupation and income-class means are still significant at the 0.001 level of probability, and deviations among education-class means, while not quite significant at 0.01, are significant at 0.025. For females, devi-

ations among class means for each of the three socioeconomic indicators taken separately are not significant at 0.10. Ignoring the no-information classes, the changes in the estimates of the effects (Table 4) of socioeconomic status are constant among classes within each socioeconomic indicator and small (the largest in absolute value being 0.00272, for education. Therefore, comparisons among classes (Table 4) are not distorted by including the "not available" class for education, occupation, and income and the "under 18" class for education.
In testing for interactions (for both sexes) between each pair of the three indicators, we find that none is significant at 0.05. This suggests that education, occupation, and income are statistically independent in their ability to identify variation in serum cholesterol. Therefore, as we next ex-

aminé the means of the individual classes of each indicator, we feel justified inconsidering each indicator apart from, as well as in conjunction with, the others.

Due to the fact that the effect on lncholesterol of socioeconomic indicators (taken separately or combined) isstatistically significant inmales but not females, the rest ofthis paper will be confined toa consideration of the effects on serum cholesterol of each socioeconomic outcome for males only. The test for equality of education class means (in males) is significant at the 0.01 level of probability; but looking at each round individually, we find that the Round I test issignificant at 0.001 while the Round I I test is not significant at 0.10 (Table 2). Therefore, there is an indication that the connection between educational level and serum cholesterol may not be consistent between rounds. Although we could have taken those people measured in only one round and used analysis of variance to test for around by class interaction here, we chose not to reducethe data set inthis way, preferring instead to keep the sample intact.

Hence, we proceeded toexamine the in-

dividual effects based on the rounds pooled.

Given education, the tests are still significant at 0.001 for the rounds pooled and Round II and 0.01 for Round I. Hence, there is strong evidence for a relationship between occupational class and serum cholesterol, even after an adjustment for educational class. The occupation classes with the highest levels of serum cholesterol in the data unadjusted for education are sales personnel, managerial and office personnel, and professional and semi-professional individuals; those with the lowest levels of serum cholesterol are unskilled, unemployed, and clerical and kindred workers (Table 4). Other classes with sizable negative effects are agricultural and semi-skilled workers. Those with effects nearly zero are "not available," skilled, and domestic workers.
The individual effects of occupation given education are essentially the same as those for occupation considered independent of education, except for the professional and semi-professional class, which has a negligible effect after adjustment for education, of serum cholesterol in the professional class This result is not unexpected, since the professional occupation class contains mostly people in the college-educated classes, which have high serum cholesterol; the high level (with education not accounted for) is eliminated when education is taken into account.

For multiple comparisons among class means, the occupation classes were rearranged into "white-collar" (professional, managerial and office, clerical and kindred, and sales), "blue-collar" (skilled, semiskilled, domestic, and unskilled), and agricultural workers along with those who are unemployed or for whom there is no information. Scheffé simultaneous 95 per cent confidence intervals show that white-collar workers have statistically significantly greater serum cholesterol than a combined class made up of blue-collar and agricultural workers; this contrast is not significant when education has been accounted for. Contrasts of all other pairs of the classes considered above (which were chosen in advance) are not significant. Of the comparisons chosen after we looked at these data, a number are significant (Table 5).
Testing for a relationship between serum cholesterol and income, we find the pooledround test for equal class means to be significant at 0.001 ; the test is significant at 0.001 for Round I and 0.01 for Round II. Given education and occupation, the tests are significant at 0.01 for the rounds combined and Round I, and 0.05 for Round II. An increase in serum cholesterol with increasing income (with education and occupation accounted for) is indicated. In the data unadjusted for education and occu-

pation, those classes with individuals with family income over $7,000 have aboveaverage serum cholesterol (Table 4). The "no-information" class has the smallest of the negative effects.
For income given education and occupation, the effects are essentially the same as for income examined independently, although all are smaller in magnitude. The Scheffé 95 per cent simultaneous confidence intervals show those individuals with high incomes (over $7,000) to have significantly greater serum cholesterol than those with low incomes (less than $7,000) ; this contrast is not significant when education and occupation are accounted for. Of the contrasts not chosen in advance, we find those individuals with income between $7,000 and $15,000 to have statistically significantly higher serum cholesterol than those with incomes between $2,000 and $5,000, even when the data have been adjusted for education and occupation.
SUMMARY
Data collected on 4,619 males and 4,730 females sampled by the Tecumseh Community Health Study provide evidence for

a relationship between sodoeconomic status, as measured by occupation and level of education and income, and serum cholesterol in males but not in females. There is also, for males, a statistically significant relationship between serum cholesterol and each of the three socioeconomic indicators taken separately. Greater than average serum cholesterol is associated with those individuals with more education and higher family income. Sales, managerial and office, and professional people have higher than average serum cholesterol, while unskilled, unemployed, and clerical workers have lower than average serum cholesterol.
The socioeconomic status of an individual accounts for only a small portion of the natural variation among age-round-replicate-adjusted ln-cholesterol values in the sample of Tecumseh, Michigan (1.80 per cent in males and 0.57 per cent in females).
