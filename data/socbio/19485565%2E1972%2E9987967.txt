This paper examines the relationship between seasonal variations in births and socioeconomic status. The analysis presented here is a replication and extension of earlier studies by Pasamanick, Dinitz, and Knoblock (1960) and Zelnik (1969). Pasamanick and his coauthors examined the indicated relationship using births to residents of Baltimore, Maryland, during the five-year period 1952-56, whereas Zelnik's analysis concerned births to Baltimore residents during the period 1961-65. In both studies, the socioeconomic status of the mothers was determined by census tract of residence, with median rental or value of the dwelling property being the determinant of the socioeconomic category of a tract.
The Pasamanick study divided the white population into five socioeconomic levels; nonwhites were treated as a single group. Their analysis indicated a rectilinear pattern of births for the highest socioeconomic one-fifth of whites, but not for nonwhites or the lowest three-fifths of the white socioeconomic continuum (Pasamanick et al., 1960). (The authors are silent on the pattern of second highest fifth.)

Zelnik's study restricted itself to the highest and lowest fifths, for whites and nonwhites. His analysis indicated a nonrectilinear pattern for all four groups, and further that the monthly patterns for the whites (and possibly also for the nonwhites) in the highest and lowest fifths did not differ from each other (Zelnik, 1969).
The discrepancy between the findings of Pasamanick et al. and Zelnik regarding the pattern of birth for the upper fifth led Zelnik to reanalyze the pattern of births for the period 1952-56, the data used by Pasamanick et al. His reanalysis indicated that contrary to the writings of Pasamanick et al., the births of the upper fifth of whites and nonwhites for the period 1952-- 56 deviated significantly from a rectilinear pattern (Zelnik, 1969).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The present study is also based on births to Baltimore residents for a period of two years, 1968-69. In this study the socioeconomic status of the mothers is measured by two indices: (1) education of mother, with college education four years and above as the highest education category and school education of six years and below as the lowest education category; and (2) the

2 Births have been adjusted for differences in the number of days in the months. There is an anomaly for whites. The number of births in the highest education group exceeds the number of births in any other education group. This anomaly is still noticed for the whites when the births are classified by socioeconomic fifths.

and highest and lowest socioeconomic fifths for whites and blacks will be examined to see whether they differ from a rectilinear pattern. According to Zelnik's findings, a test of this question would be expected to show that the births of all socioeconomic groups, both for whites and blacks, would not be rectilinear. This question is examined through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov onesample test (of goodness of fit), a nonparametric test based on the maximum absolute difference between the cumulative per cent distribution of observed and expected (in this case of 8.3% of births per month) events. The Kolmogorov-Simirnov test of goodness of fit is more sensitive than the chi-square test used for the same purpose (see Guilford, 1965, p. 262).

question was tested using the KolmogorovSmimov two-sample test. This test is based on the maximum absolute difference between the two cumulative per-cent distributions of the two samples. Thenull hypothesis of the test assumes that there is no difference in the two distributions and that they arise from thesame sample. The acceptance of the null hypothesis will arise from theabsolute difference in ogives that is not statistically significant.

If we accept education as a better measurement of socioeconomic status than the census tract, we find no significant variations in monthly distributions of births for the highest socioeconomic group, whether white or black. If weuse census tract asa measure of socioeconomic status, asused in the earlier studies, we still find no significant variations in monthly distributions of births, at least for whites. These findings disagree with those of Zelnik who found

SUMMARY
An examination of births occurring to Baltimore residents during the period 196869 reveals no signficant variability inthe distribution of births in thehighest education groups, either for whites or for blacks. The above conclusion also holds true for the highest socioeconomic one-fifth for whites. The present analysis also suggests that the distribution of births for the highest and the lowest socioeconomic groups in the case of whites differs significantly, i.e., theybelong to two different populations. This conclusion is true for the whites in both sets

Thus, on the basis of the present findings, we cansay that at least for theperiod of 1968-69 thebirths of thehighest socioeconomic fifth for whites, as measured bycensus tract, andhighest education groups for both blacks and whites do not differ significantly from rectilinearity. No seasonal variations in births occurred for those highest socioeconomic groups and, therefore, they do not conform to the pattern of seasonal variability in births for highest socioeconomic groups aswould be expected from the findings of Zelnik (1969).
