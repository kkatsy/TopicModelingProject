Lalor Foundation Research Fellowship Program for 1974

The Lalor Foundation has announced a new procedure for its 1974 grants for research in its areas of emphasis in mammalian reproductive physiology.
Discontinuing its former system of awards to individuals, the Foundation will make grants up to $12,500 each to qualified tax-exempt institutions for conduct of approved projects. Foreign institutions may in general achieve a similar eligibility.
The applicant institution has the obligation and freedom to make its own designation of a Lalor Fellow for conduct of the research from among its own personnel or elsewhere. The Fellow designated should have achievement matching the Ph.D. or

M.D. degree, or better, with younger people preferred, i.e., under 36 years.
Applications are restricted to research projects bearing (a) early amniocentesis in fetal development, or other means for detection and evaluation of dysgenic factors or prospects of congenital disabilities, and means toward their disposition; or (b) uterine and cervical physiology relevant to pregnancy interruption, particularly for second trimester terminations.
Forms and details for institution application are available from the Lalor Foundation, 4400 Lancaster Pike, Wilmington, Delaware, 1980S. Deadline for filing is January 15, 1974. Appointments will be announced March 15, 1974.
