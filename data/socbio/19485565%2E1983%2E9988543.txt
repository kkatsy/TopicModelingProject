ABSTRACT: Since the early 1970s, considerable attention has been given to U. S. trends in childlessness. Studies have shown that childlessness rates have been increasing in recent years; many believe that the bulk of the increase has been due to increases in voluntary childlessness. However, there have been few methodological and empirical analyses of trends in voluntary and involuntary childlessness. This paper has two objectives: to develop two procedures for measuring voluntary and involuntary childlessness with fertility survey data; and to apply empirically these approaches to five fertility surveys conducted between 1955 and 1973.

42.1 per cent for voluntary [childlessness] . . . and 57.9 per cent for physiological causes [i.e., involuntary childlessness] (Whelpton and Kiser, 1950, Vol. 2, p. 335).
These generalfindingsare roughly in line with an earlier report of Lorimer and Osborn (1934) suggesting that between 25 and 40 per cent of a group of childless women studied in the 1920's might be described as voluntarily childless. Moreover, in an analysis of women in New York City during the fall and winter of 1935-1936, Kiser noted that over 75 per cent of the "never-pregnant women reported that neither they nor their husbands had ever done anything since marriage to prevent conception. . . . Furthermore, two-thirds of the never-pregnant women reported that they were disappointed in their childless condition, and 57 per cent declared that they had, in the past, consulted a physician to ascertain why they could not have a child" (Kiser, 1939, p. 14). Nevertheless, at least 25 per cent of them could be classified as voluntarily childless.
Phase Two of the voluntaryinvoluntary childlessness trends in the United States began after World War II and was characterized by an overall reduction in childlessness, with little if any of the remaining childlessness due to voluntary factors. Among women interviewed in the 1955 growth of American Families Study (known also as GAF-I), Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell (1959) found first that childlessness had declined significantly since the early 1940's, and that "childlessness now results mainly from fecundity impairments. Few of our couples with no fecundity impairment will be voluntarily childless, that is, will deliberately avoid having any children throughout their

married life" (Freedman et al., 1959, p. 46). For example, of the 51 childless couples in GAF-I who were married 15 years or longer, only 2 of them were fecund.
Phase Two continued beyond 1955, so that the same phenomena (the very low incidence of childlessness and the virtual absence of voluntary childlessness) were found by Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson in the 1960 Growth of American Families study (known also as GAF-II). They noted that nearly all American couples in the childbearing ages demonstrated "a strong aversion to childlessness. . . . The proportion of young couples who will remain childless throughout marriage . . . will probably be in the neighborhood of 6 to 8per cent . . . [and that] the major cause of this childlessness is the existence of fecundity impairments. Voluntary childlessness is nearly extinct" (Whelpton et al., 1966, pp. 162-163).
Phase Three began in the 1960's and is characterized generally by increases in overall childlessness, as well as by increases in voluntary childlessness. The increases in the overall rates of childlessness are evident in the data presented earlier in Table 1. And the increases in voluntary childlessness during this phase (the 1960's) have been documented in a number of studies. In an analysis of 1961 Canadian census data, Veevers (1972) estimated that close to half of the childlessness occurring to women over the age of 30 may have been voluntary. In a similar vein, Rao's (1974) analysis of fertility data collected from Rhode Island women during the late 1960's suggested that among the childless women aged 30-49 living with their husbands, half of them were voluntarily childless. In still another analysis (Waller et al., 1973), it was suggested

Vol. 30, No.3

that families without children were comprised of couples who were biologically fertile, and couples who were biologically or deliberately sterile. While the study did not employ a voluntaryinvoluntary dichotomy in conceptualizing childlessness, it demonstrated that childlessness today is no longer the sole result of involuntary factors. And in a study based on data for white women collected in the 1965 National Fertility Survey, Poston (1976) examined the distributions of childless women by voluntary and involuntary categories. He estimated that over 61 per cent of women with no children who were not anticipating having children were voluntarily childless (Poston, 1976, Table 1).
Most studies of childlessness in the 1960's reported significant increases in the voluntary category during this time period. Indeed, data gathered from a variety of sources allow one to conclude with Veevers that "it seems premature to presume, as Tomasson (1966, p. 328) and others have, that a 'virtual disappearance of deliberate childlessness has already occurred' " (Veevers, 1972, p. 273). Such a prognosis perhaps would have been appropriate for the time period after World War II through most of the 1950's (Phase Two above), but clearly not for the period of the 1960's to the present (Phase Three). And the work of DeJong and Sell (1977) of changes in childlessness in the United States supports this general interpretation. Specifically, they note that the increases in childlessness in the 1960's are not "attributable primarily to changes in involuntary (i.e., biological, disease) factors" (DeJong and Sell, 1977, p. 140).
Despite the recognition, indeed, the conviction among some scholars, that voluntary childlessness has become the

prevalent form of the phenomenon in recent years, few have attempted directly to establish procedures for drawing empirical distinctions between the voluntary and involuntary categories. Some have endeavored to estimate the extent of sterility and subfecundity among very old women (the 1901-10 birth cohort in the U. S.) on the basis of retrospective reproductive histories (Ridley et al., 1979; Ridley and Dawson, 1980). Others have used more mathematically derived procedures in an attempt to analyze the voluntary and involuntary parameters (Dietz, 1979; Waller et al., 1973). Still others have used U.S. and Canadian census data to estimate indirectly the incidence of voluntary childlessness (Veevers, 1972; Poston, 1974, Wolowyna, 1977). As best as we can ascertain, except for the above mentioned paper by Poston (1976), no childlessness investigations have ventured to identify directly the actual distributions of voluntary and involuntary childlessness among married women on the basis of current information contained in national fertility surveys. Such is the first objective of this paper.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Two PROCEDURES FOR SEPARATING
VOLUNTARY FROM INVOLUNTARY
CHILDLESSNESS
Here, we describe the development and implementation of measurement strategies for separating childlessness into voluntary and involuntary categories. We then, in the next section, apply these methodologies to five fertility surveys conducted in the United States between 1955 and 1973in an attempt to ascertain levels and changes over time in types of childlessness.

There are at least two models for distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary childlessness: a cognitive model and a behavioral model. These alternative perspectives define voluntary and involuntary childlessness on the basis of either one's knowledge of fecundity or one's behavior. The two distinctions are described below.
In attempting to separate various categories of childlessness, one begins with a population of childless women who are not pregnant. We omit childless women who were pregnant at the time of the survey because their accurate categorization is ambiguous, if not impossible. For example, should childless women who are pregnant be classified as childless or childed? Working thus with childless women who were not pregnant, we then ascertain their future fertility intentions. Those who had no children at the time of interview but intended to have children in the future are set aside as temporarily childless.
It is at this point that the distinction between the behavioral and cognitive approaches becomes apparent. We have available for analysis a population of childless women who were not pregnant and who did not plan to have children in the future. But there are at least two ways to determine whether or not their childlessness can be designated voluntary. One procedure involves examining their contraceptive behavior. If a childless woman who did not intend to have children in the future was contracepting, then one could assume that she was choosing of her own volition not to have children in the future. If a childless woman was not contracepting, but did not intend to have children in the future, one cannot immediately conclude that she was involuntarily childless. She might not have been contracepting be-

cause she (or her husband) were sterilized for contraceptive reasons. Thus the noncontracepting woman with no operation, and the one who was sterilized but not for contraceptive reasons, are both assumed to be involuntarily childless. And, to the voluntarily childless woman who was so defined because of her contracepting behavior must now be added another type of voluntarily childless women, the noncontracepting woman who had (or her husband had) had a sterilization question principally for contraceptive reasons. This is the line of reasoning that characterizes the behavioral approach for distinguishing voluntarily from involuntarily childless women.
Another procedure involves inquiring about the woman's knowledge of her fecundity. If a woman with no children who was not pregnant at interview time knew that she was capable of having children, yet planned to have none in the future, we assume she was voluntarily childless. On the other hand, if a woman with no children who was not pregnant knew that she was unable to have children in the future, she is assumed to be involuntarily childless, as long as her inability to conceive does not stem from a sterilizing operation performed for contraceptive reasons. This second approach distinguishes between involuntarily and voluntarily childless wives on the basis of their knowledge of their fecundity or sterility, and not their contraception behavior. This distinction characterizes the major differences between the behavioral and cognitive approaches to separating voluntarily from involuntarily childless women. Figure 1 portrays these basic two approaches.
These categories of childlessness, of course, are plagued with reliability and validity problems. Some of the VOLUN-

Thomas' observation that if persons "define situations as real, they are real in their consequences," (cited in Merton, 1957, p. 421) would appear to be applicable in this context.

Veevers (1973b) is especially applicable here. She reports that two-thirds of the childless women in her sample did not decide on childlessness prior to marriage, but "remained childless asa result of decisions to postpone having children until some future time, a future which never came" (Veevers, 1973b, p.359).

U.S. surveys should provide tentative approximations.
The above are two alternative strategies for separating the phenomenon of childlessness into voluntary and involuntary categories. In the next section we apply both alternative strategies to data from fertility surveys conducted in 1955, 1960,1965,1970, and 1973.
APPLYING THE TWO CHILDLESSNESS
SEPARATION PROCEDURES TO FIVE
FERTILITY SURVEYS
Five fertility surveys conducted between 1955 and 1973 provided the basic data to be used in the empirical application of the two childlessness separation procedures. The five surveys used are the following: the 1955 Growth of American Families study (known also as GAF-I) (see Freedman, Whelpton and Campbell, 1959, for further information); 1960 Growth of American Families Study (known also as GAF-II) (see Whelpton et al., 1966, for additional information); the 1965 National Fertility Survey (known also as the 1965 NFS) (see Ryder and Westoff, 1971, for additional information); the 1970 National Fertility Survey (known also as the 1970 NFS) (see Westoff and Ryder, 1977, for additional information) and the 1973 National Survey of Family Growth, Cycle 1 (known also as NSFG-I) (see Pratt, 1977 for additional information and technical documentation). All five surveys are based on cross-sectional samples, and to the best of our knowledge, no woman was included in more than one of the surveys.
Given the fact that the five surveys were conducted over an eighteen-year period and by different groups of investigators, one would not expect the various questions pertaining to pregnancy status, fecundity, contraceptive prac-

tice, fertility expectations, etc., to be identical from one survey to the next. Surprisingly, although there are many differences between and among the sets of questions, the similarities in question form, content, and intention are indeed remarkable. We have compared and contrasted elsewhere (Poston and Kramer, 1981, pp. 32-37) the various questions from the five surveys which are employed in developing the cognitive and behavioral approaches. Limitations of space preclude our presenting these comparisons here. We are of the opinion, however, that the questions are similar enough in the five surveys that reliability issues are not a problem when applying the two childlessness separation approaches in the various surveys.
To illustrate the actual application of the two procedures, we draw now on data from the 1973 National Survey of Family Growth, Cycle 1. This is a survey of 9,797 civilian noninstitutionalized women living in the coterminous United States, who are less than 45 years of age, and either single with natural children presently living in the household, currently married, or previously married. The survey was directed and administered by the National Center for Health Statistics over a period centering on September 1973.
The cognitive approach to childlessness separation is portrayed in a decision tree in Figure 1. Using the data from the 1973 NSFG, we begin with the 9,797 women in the study. The 3,933 nonwhite women are first excluded from the analysis. Nonwhite respondents are excluded due to their different trends in childlessness when compared to whites (Poston and Gotard, 1977). Also, the 350 women who were pregnant at the time the interviews were conducted are excluded because of the difficulty in

classifying them accurately. Remaining for analysis are 5,514 women, 903 of whom were childless. These 903 women reported never having a live birth in response to the question, "Altogether, how many babies have you had born to you, including any who died very young?"
At this point, the temporarily childless women are separated out by examining responses to the question, "Do you and your husband intend to have another baby?" More than two-thirds of the women answered that they intended to have a child; 257 women answered they intended to have no children in the future.
These 257 women who intended to remain childless are then separated into voluntarily childless and involuntarily childless groups. Following the cognitive approach, reference is made to a questionnaire item concerning fecundity. Those women who did not "have any reason to believe it would be difficult or impossible for you or your husband to have a (another) baby" are classified as normally fecund. There are 113 women thus categorized. However, 144 women had reason to believe it would be difficult or impossible to have a baby, and they are designated sterile or subfecund. Of these, 19had not had an operation; 125 women had had an operation which resulted in their sterility, 23 of whom had the operation for contraceptive reasons, and 102 not for contraceptive reasons.
The number of voluntarily childless women, therefore, are identified by adding the 113 normally fecund women to the 23 sterile women who had an operation for contraceptive reasons, for a total of 136voluntarily childless women. The number of involuntarily childless women is determined by adding the 19

sterile women who had not had an operation to the 102 sterile women who had had an operation but not for contraceptive purposes, for a total of 121 involuntarily childless women.
After applying the cognitive approach of separating voluntary from involuntary childlessness to data from the 1973 National Survey of Family Growth, we conclude that almost 72 per cent of the more than 900 childless women are temporarily childless, 15 per cent are voluntarily childless, and 13 per cent are involuntarily childless. We turn next to an illustration of the behavioral approach.
In the behavioral separation strategy, temporarily childless women are identified in the same way as in the cognitive procedure. The behavioral and cognitive approaches differ only in the manner used to separate permanently childless women into voluntary and involuntary categories (see the bottom part of Figure 1).
After identifying the 257 women intending to remain permanently childless, their responses to a question on contraceptive behavior are examined. Those who responded affirmatively to the question "Are you using a method to prevent pregnancy" are assumed to be voluntarily childless (N= 152). In addition, noncontracepting women who had (or whose husbands had) had a sterilizing operation and who also responded affirmatively to the question, "Was the operation done at least partly so that you would not have any (more) children," are labelled voluntarily childless. No women fell into this category in 1973. If there was no operation (N= 19) or if the operation was not performed for contraceptive purposes (N=86), then the noncontracepting childless women are designated involuntary.

In this final section of the paper we first summarize and examine the results on childlessness according to the cognitive and behavioral approaches of determining voluntary and involuntary categories. The basic trends in childlessness between 1955 and 1973 are then examined, and an interpretation is proposed to assist in understanding the data.
This paper has developed two approaches for separating childless women

As seen also in Table 2, following the cognitive approach, we find there were more involuntarily than voluntarily childless women in 1955 and in 1960, but the trend reversed itself in 1965,1970, and 1973 with more women in the voluntary than the involuntary category.

age group sampled in the 1955 survey were among these low fertility and high childlessness cohorts and are not fully representative of most of the others studied in 1955. Relaxing the effects or influence of the 1955 groups, the trends in childlessness for the older women partially resemble the decreasing and then increasing pattern observed in the total population.
The general pattern of childlessness from 1955 to 1973observed in the populations studied should mainly be reflecting changing patterns of voluntary childlessness. That is, the voluntary component of total childlessness should be varying inversely with fertility. The involuntary component should be tending more toward stability than variation over the periods studied. Accordingly, the pattern of decreasing childlessness through the 1960's, followed by increasing childlessness in the 1970's, should be

particularly prominent among the voluntarily chi.idless.
Examination of the percentages of women voluntarily childless in Table 3, however, does not indicate such a pattern in the total population. But among younger women, the trend is very apparent. Two per cent of the younger women were voluntarily childless in 1955, and over one per cent in both 1960 and 1965; the percentage then increased to 2.2 in 1970, and even higher to 3.7 in 1973. This trend follows in an opposite manner the general course of fertility over the same period. Although the trends in involuntary childlessness do vary somewhat over the period, they do tend toward stability since 1965. Observe in particular the near-constant involuntary percentages for women of 30 or more years of age in 1965,1970, and 1973.

and large fractions of the temporarily childless women remain childless through the end of their childbearing years, we can expect to observe even greater percentages of voluntary childlessness than those described in the preceding paragraphs. The emergence of voluntary childlessness as a less than deviant lifestyle (if only in terms of numerical frequency) would appear thus to be a very real possibility, based upon the data of this report. Why should this be so? Why should there be increases in voluntary childlessness in the United States? As we observed earlier, most of the childlessness occurring among U.S. women from 1940 to 1960 was due mainly to involuntary sterility or subfecundity. However, since the 1960's, data and studies, many of which were reviewed earlier in this report, suggest an increase in overall rates of childlessness, particularly its voluntary form. Why have there been increases in voluntary childlessness? What types of societal level mechanisms may be related to the emergence of this phenomenon?
It may well be that the emergence of voluntary childlessness is linked with broader changes in the fabric of the U.S. society regarding fertility control, contraceptive technology, sexual and family norms, and female work patterns and preferences. Bumpass (1973, p. 67) has noted that
significant proportions of the population [now] . . . expect fertility control to be both complete and unobtrusive. . . . [Therefore] childbearing can now be voluntary in a radically different sense than ever before. Under the previous fertility regime, women could not confidently plan a lifetime of childlessness, nor even the prevention of unwanted fertility. Obviously, some women could and did avoid unwanted fertility but no individual could be sure of that outcome in advance. . . .

The gestalt that accompanied this regime was one in which the adult role expectations of women were structured around motherhood, and the separation of work and home in industrial society buttressed this role structure. Cultural values with respect to fertility were, in part, rationalization of the inevitable.
Important for our understanding of the increasing trends in childlessness is the fact that the changing values of this fertility control revolution have legitimized and have begun to make possible the realization of equal opportunity between the sexes because nonfamilial roles for women are now a realistic option.
The potential for complete fertility control makes childbearing--when and if--a matter of choice in an ultimate sense that never before existed. For the first time motherhood itself is fully a matter for rational evaluation. Since i t . . . [no longer must] be rationalized because inevitable, costs as well as virtues must be weighed. . . . Obviously, childbearing roles offer much that is rewarding, but these rewards are not likely to be experienced equally by all women. . . . [Motherhood has become a competitor] with other social roles. (Bumpass, 1973, p. 68).
The above arguments have been set forth in an attempt to provide an interpretation of recent changes in fertility control, especially as they relate to the question of childlessness. If the reasoning is true and the society is indeed experiencing a major change in fertility control values, these kinds of explanations may aid in accounting for the increases in voluntary childlessness occurring in the United States in the late 1960's and early 1970's among the cohorts of young white women. They suggest that the increasing childlessness is voluntary, and the increases have not been due to increasing sterility and subfecundity stemming from involuntary factors.
