ABSTRACT: We studied the phosphoglucomutase phenotype in relation to fertility parameters in a consecutive series of 204 women who had delivered a normal live-born child in Rome. A highly significant association was found between age of the women and phosphoglucomutase phenotype, suggesting a reduced rate of reproduction among women of phosphoglucomutase Type 1. Previous spontaneous abortion appears related to both age and phosphoglucomutase enzymatic type. An increased incidence of abortion in women of older ages was observed only in phosphoglucomutase Type 1. Gestational duration and fetal intrauterine growth rate are also significantly associated with maternal phosphoglucomutase phenotype. The pattern is complex, but also in this instance the influence of maternal age was evident. Considered altogether, the data suggest that phosphoglucomutase may have an important role in zygote development and survival through the whole span of intrauterine life.

One of the most challenging problems in human reproductive biology is to explain the very high mortality rate at the early stages of zygote development. A mortality rate of 80 per cent has been recently demonstrated (Diamond, 1987), and it raises many important questions. Is the loss of zygotes due to mechanisms similar to those operating later during intrauterine and extrauterine life, or is it due to unique events? What is the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic phenomena? It is possible that genomic instability (Hicks, 1987; Vogel and Motulsky, 1986) prevails during the early stages of development producing a great number of lethal aberrations. Recent observations point also to genetic polymorphisms which may be involved through a balance between prenatal advantage and postnatal disadvantage (Dronamraiu et al., 1984; Wadheim et al., 1986).

The understanding of such a high embryo mortality rate may be relevant to important clinical problems such as infertility, habitual abortion, and in vitro fertilization.
PHOSPHOGLUCOMUTASE GENETIC POLYMORPHISM: POSSIBLE ROLE IN
INTRAUTERINE DEVELOPMENT
Phosphoglucomutase (PGM) is an enzyme widely distributed in nature which catalyzes the reaction glucose-1phosphate ^ glucose-6-phosphate, an essential step in carbohydrate metabolism. Four separate loci determine distinct sets of PGM isozymes: PGM1; PGM2, PGM3, and PGM4 (Spencer et al., 1964; Hopkinson and Harris, 1968; McAlpine et al., 1970; Cantu and Ibarra, 1982). Placental extracts are very rich in PGMX isozymes (Hopkinson and Harris, 1968). The PGM4 locus seems to be active only during lac-

tation and controls a set of isozymes present in milk.
PGMX and PGM3 are usually polymorphic. PGM2 is polymorphic only in some populations. PGM4 has been found to be polymorphic in the population in which it was discovered (Cantu and Ibarra, 1982).
Starch gel electrophoresis reveals three common PGMt phenotypes: PGMj-1, PGMj2-l, and PGMj2 corresponding to two common alleles PGM} and PGM? at an autosomal (chromosome n. 1) locus (Spencer et al., 1964). By isoelectric focusing, the existence of four alleles of PGMi and ten common PGMj phenotypes has been demonstrated (Sutton and Burgess, 1978).
Studies on enzyme activity of different red cell PGMX phenotypes have shown that the activity associated with the PGM] allele is about 10 per cent higher than that associated with the PGM} allele (Scacchi et al., 1983).
In 1972 we observed an association between the PGMX phenotype and neonatal jaundice in black newborn babies who were incompatible with their mothers in the ABO system (Orzalesi et al., 1972). Ananthakrishnan et al. in 1973 reported a significant deviation of PGM! phenotype distribution from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with a decreased proportion of heterozygotes among newborn infants. Such deviation was not present among adults.
In more recent studies we have shown associations of PGMX genetic polymorphism with spontaneous abortion and intrauterine development both in normal and diabetic pregnancies (Nicotra et al., 1982; Bottini et al., 1983; Bottini et al., 1985; Gloria-

Bottini et al., 1986). In the present paper we have extended the sample study of normal pregnant women and have directed our analysis to possible relations between PGMj and fertility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLES
A consecutive sample of 204 Caucasian women, each delivering a single live-born infant, was studied from the population of Rome. All women had normal pregnancies. An independent series of 366 consecutive singleton newborn infants from the same population was also considered.
METHODS
P G M I was determined by starch gel electrophoresis on red blood cell hemolysates according to Harris and Hopkinson (1976). Cord blood was obtained at birth for newborn infants, and venous blood in the first few days after delivery was obtained for women.
Statistical analyses were performed according to SPSS programs using a UNIVAC 1100/80 computer (Nie et al., 1975).
FERTILITY PARAMETERS
We have considered the history of previous spontaneous abortions, gestational duration, intrauterine growth, and age of women in relation to PGMj phenotypes.
The value of the first three variables as fertility parameters is well established in the literature (MacCluer, 1978). The fourth parameter needs some elucidation.
Since in contemporary populations the number of children produced by a

fertile woman is much below her natural reproduction rate, it is impossible to measure directly her reproductive potential by means of parameters traditionally used in population genetic studies such as total live births or offspring surviving to maturity (MacCluer, 1978). However, assuming that the number of children is planned by the couple, it should take a shorter time to produce this number by women whose reproduction rate is higher. Moreover, it can be reasonably assumed that socioeconomic status and the family-planning strategy chosen by the couple do not depend on the PGMX genotype of the woman. Therefore, in a random sample of pregnant women from an ethnically homogeneous population, genotypes with a higher rate of reproduction should be over-represented among women of younger ages and under-represented among women of older ages, whereas the reverse should be true for genotypes with a lower rate of reproduction. Based on this conceptual framework, a mathematical model of age-related differences in the distribution of types among pregnant women has been recently proposed (Gimelfarb and Bottini, 1989).
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the mean age of fertile women according to PGM! pheno-

type: PGM! 1 women have an average of 29.2 years, and PGMX 2, an average of 24.7 years. PGMX 2-1 women show an intermediate value. The differences are highly significant.
Table 2 shows the PGMt phenotypic and allelic distributions among four age groups of pregnant women delivering a live-born infant. The differences in the phenotypic distributions between the age groups of pregnant women are attributable to the differences in the phenotypic proportions of PGMj 1 and PGMj 2. The proportion of PGMj 1 phenotypes is higher and that of PGMX 2 phenotypes is lower among pregnant women of older ages than among pregnant women of younger ages. The relation between age and phenotypic proportion is linear, i.e., the proportion of PGMX 1 progressively increases and that of PGM! 2 progressively decreases with age of women. The increase of the PGM} factor (and the decrease of PGM]) with age of women is clearly evident also from the analysis of allelic distribution. For comparison, PGM! phenotype and allele frequencies in newborn female babies from the same population are also shown in Table 1. Fertile women aged 24-28 years show PGMi phenotype and allele frequencies superimposable upon those observed in female newborn babies. In younger women there is an increase of

Table 4 reports the effects of maternal age and PGMj phenotype on gestational duration. PGMi 2-1 phenotype shows the longest gestational duration and PGM: 2 phenotype shows the shortest gestational duration. A highly significant association between PGMi phenotype and gestational duration is present only among women of younger ages. No significant interaction is observed between PGMX and maternal age. This finding indicates that the pattern of association between gestational duration and PGMX phenotype is the same in both age groups, but it is much stronger among younger women than among older ones.
Table 5 shows the effects of maternal age and PGM! phenotype on birth weight. A highly significant association is observed between maternal PGMX and intrauterine growth. The proportion of infants between the 10th and 90th percentiles decreases with the dose of maternal PGM] allele (i.e., PGMt 1 < PGMx 2-1 < PGMj 2), and correspondingly there is an increase of both small-for-dates and macrosomic infants. The association is highly significant among women of younger ages,

and it is much less strong among women of older ages. No significant three-way interaction is observed, thus indicating that the pattern of relations between intrauterine growth and PGMx is the same in both age groups and that there is only a difference in the strength of association.
No significant association of fetal PGMj phenotype with gestational duration and intrauterine growth was observed in the sample of newborn infants (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
The present study shows significant differences in the proportion of phenotypes PGMX 1 and PGMt 2 among pregnant women of younger and older ages. The proportion of PGMX 2 is higher, whereas the proportion of PGMi 1 is lower, among younger than among older women. A comparison with a sample of female children shows the absence of any age trend in the distribution of PGM! 1 and PGMX 2 phenotypes as well as in the proportions of PGM! alleles. The frequencies of

class of women (i.e., low proportion of PGMt 1 and very high proportion of PGMj 2) argues against this hypothesis.
Table 3 shows that there is a significant effect of PGMX also on the relation between age of women and probability of having a positive history of spontaneous abortion. In the interpretation of these observations, however, it should be considered that spontaneous abortion represents a small fraction of the total spontaneous loss of zygotes. The data suggest that in older ages PGM! 1 women share an increased incidence of spontaneous abortion as compared to other PGMX types. The data also show that in younger ages the incidence of clinically recognizable spontaneous abortion is lower in PGM2 1 women than among other PGMj types. It is possible that PGMX 1 women have an increased probability of early spontaneous loss as compared to other women, and this may cause a lower incidence of abortion in later stages of pregnancy.
In PGM! 2 mothers the distribution of gestational duration is shifted toward the lowest values, whereas in PGMi 2-1 mothers it appears shifted toward the highest values. Considering also the association with intrauterine growth rate, the data suggest that both fetal growth and timing of fetalmaternal relationship are anticipated in PGMj 2 mothers as compared to other mothers. PGMj 2-1 mothers show the longest duration of gestation with an intermediate value of fetal growth variability. This may give a reproductive advantage to the heterozygote genotype, thus contributing to the maintenance of PGMt polymorphism.

The fact that the association between maternal PGMj and developmental parameters tends to disappear in women of older ages may be explained considering that the subtle effects of normal genetic variability are gradually obscured by stronger factors emerging with reproductive senescence.
Chakraborty et al. (1986) have examined possible relations between a series of fertility parameters (number of pregnancies, number of live births, number of children alive at the time of survey) and heterozygosity for a number of polymorphic loci. No association was found with PGM! heterozygosity. It would have been interesting to consider also possible differences between the two homozygotes PGMX 1 and PGMj 2. Our data clearly show that differences in fertility parameters between homozygotes are much greater than those observed between homozygotes and heterozygotes. We do not think that the fertility parameters considered by Chakraborty et al. (1986) are the most suitable to detect possible effects of maternal common genetic polymorphism on survival at early stages of implantation and on development during intrauterine life. It is very unlikely, in fact, that the action of such maternal genes have measurable effects on survival during the first years of extrauterine life.
The very high mortality rate of zygotes at the early stages of life suggests that factors intrinsic to developmental processes are much more important than environmental factors. It is likely that stochastic and genetic factors are the most important determinants of such high mortality rates. Their effects

are probably amplified by the instability of cellular systems during the early stages of life. On the contrary, it is well known that the most important determinants of child survival after birth are nutritional and infectious factors.
PGM! is a key enzyme in glucose metabolism and its activity may have an important role in survival during development. Although the placenta is very rich in PGM1; the enzyme is controlled by fetal genotype in this tissue. It is, therefore, unlikely that the relation between maternal PGMj and fertility is due to a mechanism operating primarily at the placental level. PGMX may contribute to the maternal glycemic control and, on the other hand, the stability of nutritional support may be of critical importance during the early stages of zygote implantation. Furthermore, in the very early stages of development the contribution of the maternal genotype to the enzymatic and metabolic makeup of the zygote may overshadow that of the paternal genotype, and the slightly lower activity of the PGM} product compared to that of the PGM^ allele may influence zygote survival negatively.
Confirmation of possible effects of the maternal PGMX genotype at implantation and/or in subsequent stages of intrauterine development may be gathered through the analysis of success rate in the practice of "in vitro" fertilization. On the other hand, determination of the PGM! phenotype may reveal a useful predictor of risk of failure.
Considering the whole pattern of associations between PGMi and the set of fertility parameters (age of women, gestational duration, birth weight, and

history of spontaneous abortion), it appears very unlikely that it represents a mere sampling chance phenomenon.
An association between two variables does not prove, however, a direct cause-effect relationship. In general, various other possibilities should be excluded. Some of these are depicted in Figure 1 in which possible effects of family-planning strategy and socioeconomic status (variable z) have been considered. Path (A) shows a statistical association between x and y without causal relation. In fact, x and y represent independent effects of a third variable (z). Since PGMj is a primary genetic factor which is determined at zygote formation, its genotype cannot be caused by other variables. Therefore, Path (A) can be excluded.
It can also be reasonably assumed that socioeconomic status and familyplanning strategy are independent of the PGMX genotype of the women. This consideration allows the exclusion of Path (B).
In the remaining path (C), the variable z does not appear to be responsible for the association between PGM1 and age of women. It is possible, however, that if one controls for familyplanning strategy, the association may be stronger in some categories than in others. Therefore, it is conceivable that the length of planned period to complete family size may influence the strength of association between PGMX and age.
A spurious association between x and y may result from the sampling of two different populations. Suppose that the sample is composed of individuals from a population showing a high frequency of PGM! 2 and a tendency to
