ABSTRACT: Using data from the 1988 Two-Per-Thousand Survey of Fertility and Birth Control, this paper examines the effects of gender, birth order, and other correlates of childhood mortality in China. Controlling for family-level factors, childhood mortality is found to be associated with the child's gender and birth order. Among firstborn children the difference between male and female childhood mortality is not statistically significant, but among others, female children between ages 1 and 5 experience higher mortality than male children. Childhood mortality is slightly higher for children who have older brothers only than for those who have older sisters only, and it is highest for those who have both older brothers and sisters. Other factors affecting childhood mortality in China include mortality of older siblings, birth interval, urban/rural residence, mother's level of education, and mother's occupation. All interactive effects between gender and family-level characteristics are found to be statistically insignificant.

China has experienced rapid mortality decline during the past four decades. Official statistics show that measures of mortality, such as crude death rate, infant mortality rate, and life expectancy, have all changed by more than 50 per cent in the 35 years from 1950-54 to 1985-89. Life expectancy gained by 70 per cent, reflecting an exceptionally rapid mortality decline by international standards. In comparison, Latin America experienced a 29 per cent increase in life expectancy, and Asia as a whole experienced a 49 per cent increase during the same period. Demographers identify the main causes of the rapid mortality decline in China as improved nutrition resulting from a more egalitarian distribution of wealth and the government's ambitious rural health care programs emphasizing preventive care (Banister, 1987; Banister and Preston, 1981; Coale, 1984; Hao, 1994).

While there has been an impressive reduction in mortality, not everyone seems to have enjoyed the benefits equally. Certain segments of the population have been, and still are, subject to higher risks of mortality than others. Estimates of female life expectancy in 1981 varied by local area, from 73.6 years in Beijing Municipality to 61.9 years in Xinjiang Province. Substantial differences were also observed among types of location: from a female life expectancy of 72.7 years in cities and 73.4 years in towns, to 68.6 years in rural counties. These differentials are found to be associated with differences in medical facilities, availability of professionally trained health workers, and levels of development (Hao, 1994;Poston, 1989). Besides the regional differences, one of the most noteworthy characteristics of differential mortality in China is its unusual age-sex pattern, characterized by higher female than

male mortality during early childhood (Hao and Wang, 1992).
In most populations with moderate to low mortality, male mortality is higher than female mortality at all ages. According to the Coale and Demeny model life tables, which represent actual experiences of mortality in a variety of populations, the male-tofemale ratio of age-specific conditional probabilities of dying between ages 1 and 5 (4Çj values in life tables) ranges from 1.1 to 1.4. The ratio is higher in populations with lower levels of mortality. A similar pattern has been observed in Japan. During the period 1950-69, when the level of female childhood mortality (conditional probability of dying between exact ages 1 and 5) declined from 35.46 to 3.79 per 1,000 infants, the average male-tofemale ratio of childhood mortality was 1.15 (Nanjo and Kobayashi, 1985). This ratio gradually increased with time.
Excess female mortality during childhood has been found elsewhere, especially in populations characterized by strong son preference such as those in South Asia (Chen et al., 1981; Das Gupta, 1987; Koenig and D'Souza,

1986; Muhuri and Preston, 1991; Phillips et al., 1987; Simmons et al., 1982; Schultz, 1982) and East Asia (Choe, 1987; Hao and Wang, 1992; Park, 1955; Ware, 1981). In this paper, we examine the patterns and covariates of childhood mortality in China in order to identify the extent of gender differentials and related factors. By doing so, we seek to achieve a better understanding of the links between son preference, family building, and childhood mortality.
Excess female mortality, when it is observed, is most evident between ages 1 and 5 when a child's health and mortality are most strongly linked to parental care (Hobcraft et al., 1985; Muhuri and Preston, 1991; Waldron, 1987). This is not surprising when we examine the leading causes of death at different ages in childhood. During infancy, most causes of deaths are related to genetic and prenatal conditions, but the leading causes of death between ages 1 and 5 are known to be respiratory infections, other infectious and parasitic diseases, diarrheal diseases, and accidents (Table 2). Whether young children die from these causes depends, to a large extent, on

52

the quality of care provided to them by adults. Higher female childhood mortality, which represents a departure from the usual pattern, suggests the unequal treatment of male and female children within a family in such areas as immunizations, quality of care during illness, exposure to risks, and allocation of resources including food. Studies on childhood mortality in India and Bangladesh have identified some gender-biased parental behaviors that may lead to excess female childhood mortality. Among these are feeding practices (Amin and Pebley, 1991; Caldwell, Reddy, and Caldwell, 1983; Chen, Huq, and D'Souza, 1981) and the use of health care facilities (Amin and Pebley, 1991; Basu, 1989; Das Gupta, 1987).
The traditional family system in China is based on patrilineal and patriarchal principle, which has developed a culture favoring sons over daughters. In modern China, the Communist revolution and industrialization have brought changes in the government-protected rights of individuals and in social and economic conditions. Nevertheless, evidence of son preference has frequently been documented in behavior related to family formation. Analyses of large-scale survey data have shown that behaviors of married couples--such as contraceptive use, fertility, and use of induced abortions--vary according to whether or not they already have sons (Arnold and Liu, 1986; Choe et al., 1992) and whether a fetus is male or female (Zeng et al., 1993; Coale and Banister, 1994). It is conceivable that son preference, which results in differential fertility behavior, may also affect parental behavior in caring for young children,

which in turn results in differential mortality.
While we hypothesize that female children experience more exposure to mortality risks than male children as a result of parent's discriminatory behavior, we also hypothesize that the discrimination against female children is not uniform across socioeconomic groups within the population. At the family level, those who are more educated or are engaged in daily activities in more modernized sectors of society may have more egalitarian attitudes toward gender roles and may be less likely to discriminate against female children.
At the intrafamily level, discrimination against female children may depend on birth order and the gender composition of other children. A crossnational study on the value of children and son preference documents that parents in societies where sons are strongly preferred wish to have daughters as well, but fewer in number than sons (Arnold and Kuo, 1984). Parents are also found to have preferences related to order of sons and daughters. Older daughters are preferred because they often perform housework and provide care for younger siblings. In many East Asian countries, older female children are also found to contribute to family finances, especially by working to help pay for the education of younger male siblings (Greenhalgh, 1985; Mintz, 1977; Lebra, 1984).
Thus, excess female mortality, originating from parents' discrimination against less desirable children, would depend on birth order and the gender of siblings. Recent studies document that this is often the case. Gender effects on childhood mortality are found

to be more pronounced among highorder births in India (Das Gupta, 1987), Bangladesh (Muhuri and Preston, 1991), and South Korea (Choe, 1987). Our analysis examines the gender effects on childhood mortality and its interaction with birth order, gender composition of older siblings, and family-level characteristics in China.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We use the data from China's 1988 Two-Per-Thousand Survey of Fertility and Birth Control. The survey, carried out by China's State Family Planning Commission, collected birth histories from nearly half a million ever-married women aged 15-57, constituting a nationally representative sample excluding Taiwan and Hong Kong (Lavely, 1991). Information is provided on the date of birth and survival status of each child these women have borne, as well as on the date of death of any child who

died before the survey. The survey also collected information on the socioeconomic characteristics of the women and their husbands such as ethnicity, residence type, education, and occupation as well as some characteristics of the family.
From a 10 per cent sample of the survey data available to us, we analyze records of 89,086 children born during 1965-87 who survived the first year of life. We limit the analysis to births during 1965-87 for two reasons. First, because the survey collected birth histories of women aged 15-57 in 1988, the births available for analysis as we go back in time are limited to women of progressively younger ages. For example, the births in 1978 are limited to women aged 47 and younger, and births in 1965 are limited to women aged 34 and younger. Second, the Chinese population experienced a series of unusually severe famines and political upheavals during the 1958-60 period,

which caused a short-term but drastic increase in mortality. By limiting our analysis to births after 1965, we avoid most of the effects of this unusual mortality change, focusing rather on the usual pattern of differential mortality.
We also limit our examination to childhood mortality occurring between ages 1 and 5 because our study focuses on the gender differentials of childhood mortality associated with parental discrimination. As discussed earlier, before age one, the most frequent causes of deaths are associated with genetic conditions: the quality of parental care does not have a large impact. Further, Chinese data based on retrospective reports of births and deaths, which are otherwise of exceptionally high quality, are known to suffer from a substantial degree of underreporting of very early infant deaths, especially for females (Coale and Banister, 1994; Smith, 1994; Zeng et al., 1993). The

reporting of deaths after infancy is found to be relatively complete.
We first compute levels of childhood mortality for four groups, based on gender and birth order. This is done by the life-table method using monthly probabilities of dying. We then examine the effects of gender and other covariates on childhood mortality by fittingproportional hazard models separately for firstborn and later-born children. We fit the hazard models to mortality between ages 1 and 5, estimating the average effects of the covariates.
Table 3 shows the list of variables we examine as covariates of childhood mortality together with simple descriptive statistics. Some variables are computed from pregnancy histories: birth interval, maternal age, number and gender composition of surviving siblings at the time of each birth, and childhood deaths of older siblings.

These variables and the gender of the child are child-specific factors. At the family level, we include mother's education, occupation, ethnicity, and urban/rural residence. To control for the secular trend in mortality, we also include the year of birth and its logarithm in the model. We assume a nonlinear relationship between maternal age and the risk of childhood mortality and include maternal age as well as its logarithm in the estimation model. The descriptive statistics of covariates shown in Table 3 reflect fertility trends and differentials in China. There are fewer births of Order 2 or higher in recent years, and such births are less likely for mothers who are younger, are Han, have formal education, and work in the nonfarm sector.

RESULTS
Figures la through Id show the monthly probability of dying at ages 6-59 months for the four groups of children classified by gender and birth order (firstborn and others). They reveal a small amount of heaping in the reported ages at death, at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. The heaping at age 12 months results in a slight underestimate of infant mortality and a slight overestimate of childhood mortality, because infant deaths at just under age one would be reported as deaths at age one. The age heaping, however, is not likely to affect the estimates of gender differentials because there is no evidence that the misreporting of age at death is related to a child's gender.

Table 4 shows the results of the lifetable analysis. For children classified by gender and birth order, the conditional probabilities of dying before age 1 (infant mortality) and between ages 1 and 5 (childhood mortality) were computed based on monthly probabilities of dying. The table also shows corresponding figures for Japan for the period 1953-60 and model life tables by Coale and Demeny (1983) for comparison. Both infant and childhood mortality are lower among firstborn children than among other children. Part of this difference is attributable to spurious associations. Women's characteristics associated with higher fertility are also associated with higher mortality of their children. For example, women with no formal education are more

likely to have children of high birth orders than women with some formal education, and at the same time, children from mothers with no education are likely to experience higher mortality than children from mothers with some formal education. In addition, because the level of fertility has been falling rapidly in recent years, children of higher birth orders are more likely to have been born at an earlier time, when the general level of mortality was much higher (Hao and Wang, 1992).
The sex ratio of mortality varies by birth order and age of children. Infant mortality is 23 per cent higher for males than for females among firstborn children, but the difference is very small for higher-order births. However, the possibility of underreporting

early infant deaths, which may include sex-selective infanticides (Coale and Banister, 1994; Smith, 1994; Zeng et al., 1993), makes it difficult to interpret the sex ratios of infant mortality.
Contrary to the Japanese pattern and the model life tables, childhood mortality in China is higher for females than for males among both firstborn and higher-order children, although the difference is greater for higherorder children. We make a tentative conclusion that female children suffer excess mortality at ages 1 through 4, and that this excess female mortality is higher among children who have older siblings.
We conducted statistical tests of excess female mortality through multivariate analyses. Table 5 shows the

estimated effects of covariates on childhood mortality when proportional hazard models are fitted to the data. Table 6 shows the net effects of the covariates on childhood mortality in terms of the expected probability of dying between ages 1and 5 for children belonging to different groups. These probabilities are computed from the estimated proportional hazard model by substituting specified values for the factors under consideration and mean values for all other factors in the model.
Tables 5 and 6 show that, after controlling for the secular trend, all of the family-level factors (urban residence, mother's education, and mother's occupation) included in the model are statistically significant in explaining

differential childhood mortality. These findings are consistent with results from other studies on childhood mortality in China (Tu, 1989) and elsewhere (e.g., Hobcraft et al., 1984). Also consistent with findings elsewhere, children born to families that have already experienced childhood mortality are much more likely to die during childhood than are children born to other families. Children born after a short birth interval also experience much higher mortality (e.g., Hobcraft et al., 1985) than other children.
The child's gender is not a statistically significant covariate of childhood mortality among firstborn children. It is statistically significant at the 10 per cent level, however, among higherorder births. A more meaningful test

of significance, however, would be whether the observed gender difference in childhood mortality departs from the usual male-to-female ratio, which ranges between 1.1 and 1.4. The estimated relative risk of childhood mortality in China differs significantly at the 5 per cent level from the lower limit of commonly observed values for later-born children, but not for firstborn children. In other words, the excess female childhood mortality observed in China is statistically significant at the 5 per cent level for children of birth order two or higher but not for firstborn children. Table 5 also shows that none of the interaction terms between gender of the child and socioeconomic covariates is statistically significant, implying that parental

later-born children, females experience higher levels of mortality than males. On the assumption that differential childhood mortality is largely due to differential parental care, our findings suggest that female children with older siblings receive less favorable care than their male counterparts. Chinese parents seem to value a firstborn female child nearly as much as a male. This finding is consistent with results from other studies on the status of female children in East Asia. Such studies have found that firstborn female children are likely to contribute

to family welfare, not only by performing household duties and child care, but also by contributing to household income by employment. Parents are thus willing to invest in the eldest female child (see, for example, Greenhalgh, 1985). Another possible explanation for the lack of gender differential in childhood mortality among firstborn children is the simultaneous effect of parent's attitudes on both fertility and childhood mortality. Parents with egalitarian attitudes toward sons and daughters are more likely than others to have only one child.

Among children who have older siblings, the level of childhood mortality also depends on whether they have sisters or brothers. In general, childhood mortality is highest in families with both older brothers and sisters and lowest in families with older sisters only. Among families with older sisters only, female children are at a much higher risk of childhood mortality than are male children. This gender differential is smallest for children who are born to families with male children only. In other words, among female children in families with more than one child, girls who have only brothers experience the least discrimination: dis-

crimination against female children seems to start with second daughters.
What makes female children in China experience higher levels of mortality than male children? As we have seen earlier, the leading causes of death between ages 1 and 5 are preventable to a certain extent and depend on the quality of parental care. Although we do not have direct information on the quality of child care, there are some indirect indicators. One documented indicator is mothers' breastfeeding behavior. In China the length of exclusive breastfeeding does not differ much between male and female children, but the median length

of breastfeeding with supplemental food is about two months longer for males (Tu, 1990; Wang, 1991). Although the direct effect of breastfeeding on child survival is not strong after the first year of life (Tu, 1989), we consider breastfeeding to be an indicator of parents' affection and care, especially after the introduction of supplemental food.
Another measurable behavior is the probability of having additional births. The probability of having another birth, and of having one after a short interval, is much higher in China after the birth of a female (see Choe et al., 1992, for example). A short subsequent birth interval is known to be strongly associated with high childhood mortality in China and elsewhere (Retherford et al., 1989;Tu, 1989). Female children may receive less parental care and allocation of resources than male children because they are more likely to have a younger sibling at a very early age. We do not have information on other possible behaviors such as feeding, immunization, and child care arrangements.
Our analysis shows that discrimination against females is not evident for firstborn children. This finding may partly be because parents who do not discriminate against children according to their gender may also be more likely to have just one child.
Parental behavior in China seems to be influenced strongly by a desire to have at least one son combined with a preference for a small family.2 In this

sense, excess female childhood mortality can be viewed as a part of a strategy to build ideal families that are small in size but include sons. Other behaviors related to this strategy include sexselective induced abortions, resulting in high sex ratios at birth, and female infanticides (Coale and Banister, 1994; Zeng et al., 1993).
Our analysis also found that among those parents who have more than one child the discrimination against female children is more or less uniform across families with different socioeconomic characteristics. This finding suggests that developmental changes that improve the socioeconomic status of families in China will not necessarily improve the status of female children. Eliminating gender-based discriminatory attitudes among parents will depend on fundamental changes in the norms that prevail throughout Chinese society.
