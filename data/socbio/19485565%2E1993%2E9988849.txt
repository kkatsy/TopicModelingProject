ABSTRACT: Both breastfeeding initiation and duration increased in Peru during 1977-86. Although one would have expected that the average incidence and duration of breastfeeding would have declined as a result of changes in population characteristics, the potential for an overall decline was more than overcome by changes in behavior. A net increase in initiation and duration is shown for all subgroups of interest. The largest absolute increases are documented for children who, in 1977, were the least likely to be breastfed and who were breastfed for the shortest durations.

In developing countries, breastfeeding is one of the most important determinants of infant health during the first year of life (Habicht et al., 1986; Holland, 1987; Knodel and Kintner, 1977; Millman and Cooksey, 1987; Palloni and Millman, 1986; Palloni and Tienda, 1986; Pebley and Stupp, 1987). Besides being a clean source of important nutrients, breast milk provides the infant immunological protection against disease. Prolonged breastfeeding further contributes to a child's wellbeing through stimulating the emotional ties between the mother and the child and through causing longer birth intervals (for a review, see VanLandingham et al., 1991).
Reports of an apparent decline in breastfeeding initiation and duration in many developing countries during the 1970's and early 1980's have focused renewed attention on the determinants of breastfeeding behavior (Chayovan et al., 1990; Stewart et al., 1991;Trussell et al., 1992; Zohoori et al., 1991) and have led to the adoption of breast-

feeding promotion as one of WHO'S and UNICEF's top policy priorities (Grant, 1988). Concern over diarrheal disease, one of the leading causes of child morbidity and mortality in most Third World societies, has also focused more general attention on weaning practices (Ashworth and Feachem, 1985; Chayovan et al., 1990; Feachem and Koblinski, 1984).
Most analyses of differentials in breastfeeding duration have examined breastfeeding behavior only at one point in time rather than over time. Designing successful policy interventions requires a better understanding of trends and changes in differentials over time. For example, much of the reported decline in breastfeeding duration may be due primarily to changes in population characteristics over time rather than to behavioral changes within subgroups of women. The results from a recent study (Guilkey et al., 1990) that examined changes in the determinants of breastfeeding behavior in the Philippines between 1973 and

1983 are instructive in this regard. Although breastfeeding initiation had declined in the Philippines over this tenyear period, the decline was explained almost entirely by shifts in population characteristics over time (the different characteristics of women in the two samples) rather than by behavioral changes within population subgroups. Women in all residence and education subcategories had increased their duration of breastfeeding. Similar results, based on data from both the World Fertility Surveys (WFS) and the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), have been reported by GrummerStrawn (1991a) for fifteen developing countries. The author found that changes in the distribution of women across population subgroups have exerted a downward pressure on the duration of breastfeeding in nearly every country examined, while trends within subgroups in most countries have generally been positive, leading to an overall net increase in breastfeeding duration.
In this paper, we examine changes in breastfeeding initiation and duration in Peru between 1977 and 1986. Peru makes an interesting case study of trends and determinants of infant feeding. Breastfeeding duration is longer in Peru than in most other Latin American countries, and between the mid1970's and mid-1980's, breastfeeding duration in Peru increased more substantially (by two to three months, depending on the measure used) than in other developing countries (Trussell et al., 1992). Furthermore, as one of Latin America's poorest countries, Peru has one of the highest child mortality rates in the region--112 per thousand in 1980-85 (Hill and Peb-

ley, 1989). Information on changes in breastfeeding behavior over time can thus provide valuable insights to health policy makers responsible for the design of breastfeeding promotion campaigns and child health interventions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our analyses use data from two nationally representative retrospective surveys: the 1977-78 WFS and the 1986 DHS. Details of the sampling and data collection procedures for the two surveys can be found elsewhere (Instituto Nacional de Planificación, 1979; Instituto Nacional de Estadística, 1988). ' These surveys collected comparable data on socioeconomic status, mother's background, and demographic characteristics. They also obtained similar information on breastfeeding initiation and duration. "Breastfeeding" refers to any breastfeeding, whether or not children are given supplemental foods. Both surveys asked questions on whether a child was ever breastfed and, if so, for how long. These questions, however, were asked for a different subgroup of births in the two surveys: in the WFS, for the last and next-to-last births only (Ferry and Smith, 1983),2 in the DHS,
1While both surveys used a multi-stage cluster sampling technique, our analysis implicitly assumes that a simple random sample was employed. As a result, the standard errors we report are slightly underestimated. We do not expect that accounting for the complex sampling procedures would substantially affect our conclusions.
2If the woman was currently pregnant, breastfeeding information on the next-to-last child was not included in the file, because of the decision to code breastfeeding information in terms of open and last closed birth intervals. For currently pregnant women, the last closed interval was defined as the interval between the last birth and the current preg-

for all children born within five years of the survey date. Under the assumption that women do not breastfeed a child after the birth of a subsequent child, one can determine in both surveys whether or not each child was still being breastfed at the time of the interview.3
The differences in data collection had important implications for our choice of methodology. An analysis of trends over time requires using a comparable sample of children and eliminating problems that might arise from the way information was obtained for the dependent variable of interest. For these analyses, we considered two alternative approaches. To study duration and its determinants, we could have employed retrospectively reported ages at weaning with techniques of survival analysis. We decided against this for two reasons. First, retrospective reports commonly display heaping at durations of 6, 12, and 18 months (Lesthaeghe and Page, 1980; Trussell et al., in press). Although such heaping could represent
nancy. These women did not have an open interval (Trussell et al., 1992).
3In the DHS, women were asked explicitly whether or not they were currently breastfeeding their most recently born child. In the WFS, if women reported that they had ever breastfed a child, they were then asked for how many months the child had been breastfed. "Still breastfeeding" was an acceptable coded response. In the WFS, women thus could have reported an intended duration of breastfeeding for currently breastfed children. For this reason, when the reported duration of breastfeeding exceeded the current age of the child in the WFS, these cases were coded as still breastfeeding. This coding approach was previously adopted by Knodel and Debavalya (1980) and Trussell et al. (in press). Also, in the WFS standard recode data file, all women who were currently pregnant were coded as not currently breastfeeding. To produce comparable estimates from both surveys, we coded all currently pregnant women in the DHS as not currently breastfeeding.

real preferences for weaning times, previous research has demonstrated that the age heaping that is common in retrospective reports primarily reflects misreporting of weaning times (Grummer-Strawn, 1991a). Haaga (1988) has further shown that the tendency to report that a child was weaned at popular durations differs by subgroups; such variations in reporting could have affected our estimates of differentials and trends over time.4
Second, an unbiased analysis of breastfeeding duration requires a sample of all births from a given reference period. Otherwise, estimated durations would be biased upward because of the exclusion of births from women with short birth intervals (John et al., 1988). Because the WFS collected information only for the last two births, we would have been forced to narrow the reference period to roughly two years to have data for all births in the WFS. Such a restriction, however, would have led to an underestimate of the mean duration of breastfeeding since all infants would not have been weaned within this time period.
An alternative approach that overcomes both of these problems is to use current-status data, which indicate whether a child was currently being breastfed at the time of the survey. John et al. (1988) have shown that current-status measures produce unbiased estimates of mean survival time.
4Trussell et al. (1992) have demonstrated that, on average, durations of breastfeeding based on data for current status are shorter than those based on retrospective data from the WFS, whereas this relationship is reversed in the DHS. This discrepancy is likely caused by misreporting of ages at weaning in retrospective data. Current-status data are considered more reliable because respondents can more easily report their current behavior than recall the date of some previous event.

For the analysis of breastfeeding duration, we restricted our sample to singleton, live births born to ever-married women5 within five years preceding the survey. Sample sizes were 6,657 for the WFS and 2,943 for the DHS. Because the length of breastfeeding can be truncated by the death of the child, the influence of mortality on trends and differentials in breastfeeding behavior had to be separated from the effects of socioeconomic and demographic factors. Therefore, we first examined trends in breastfeeding behavior among all and surviving children between the two surveys to determine the contribution of any decline in mortality to the observed change in mean duration. All subsequent analyses of the relative effects of population and behavioral change over time were based on surviving children only.
By including all surviving children in calculations of breastfeeding duration, the duration measure we report implicitly combined information on whether or not children were ever breastfed, and among those that were, the age at weaning. To analyze the duration of breastfeeding among only those who were ever breastfed would have required truncating the reference period to roughly two years, since information on whether the child was ever breastfed could be obtained only from the retrospective data.
In addition to examining changes in breastfeeding duration, we also conducted a separate analysis of trends in breastfeeding initiation among surviv-

ing last-born children only.6 For these analyses, our sample sizes consisted of 3,560 surviving singleton live births from the WFS and 1,816 from the DHS. In summary, we analyzed two measures of breastfeeding behavior: (1) mean duration among all surviving children, and (2) proportion ever breastfed among surviving last-born children only.

METHODS

The estimation of the mean duration of breastfeeding from currentstatus data was calculated by summing the proportions currently breastfeeding each month:

CS-Mean = ViS(0)+

where we define the survivorship curve S(i) = StillBF(i)/N(i), where StillBF(i) represents the number of children aged i still being breastfed, N(i) represents the total number of births / months ago, and survivorship is understood in this context to be the proportion still breastfed (GrummerStrawn and Trussell, in press).
The use of current-status data in a multiple regression format, on the other hand, is more problematic and has been considered by several authors (Diamond et al., 1986; McDonald, 1981; Vanderhoeft, 1982; Page et al., 1982; Trussell and Rodriguez, 1990). In related research, we have compared several proposed techniques and found one method to be particularly flexible
6By restricting the analyses of initiation to lastborn children only, we slightly overestimated the proportion ever breastfed. Based on data from the DHS, the proportion ever breastfed among all surviving children born in the five years before the survey was 95.3 per cent. Among surviving last births, the proportion was 95.8 per cent.

and parsimonious in the analysis of current-status data (Grummer-Strawn, 19916). This method involves the use of logistic regression in which the baseline log-odds of currently breastfeeding each month are modeled with a natural cubic spline. A cubic spline is a series of third-degree polynomials defined separately for specified age intervals. The age segments are joined together at specified points called knots, and constraints on the polynomials ensure that they join together smoothly (for a discussion of splines in regression analysis, see Smith, 1979; Wegman and Wright, 1983). Fairly few knots can produce a smooth yet flexible survivorship curve that falls monotonically with increasing duration. In our analysis, we fitted natural cubic splines by using four age intervals: 0-12,12-24,24-36, and 36-60 months (for a definition of natural cubic splines, see McNeil et al., 1977). Estimating the multivariate model involves including four variables needed to define the spline function along with chosen determinants of breastfeeding behavior:

10, otherwise

The dependent variable is coded " 1 " if the child was currently breastfed, and "0" otherwise. Coefficients on the explanatory variables (the ßs) have the standard interpretation as in any logistic regression model: positive coefficientsraise the log-odds of still breastfeeding at any duration. Thus, positive coefficients indicate a longer mean duration of breastfeeding. Logistic regression techniques are also used in the analyses of breastfeeding initiation, where the dependent variable is coded " 1 " if the child was ever breastfed and 0 otherwise; positive coefficients in this case indicate a higher probability that the child was ever breastfed.
VARIABLE SELECTION
Several previous studies have discussed models of breastfeeding behavior and various individual, household, and community-level factors associated with breastfeeding initiation and duration (Akin et al., 1981; Laukaran et al., 1981; Popkin et al., 1983). We based our choice of explanatory variables (Table 1) on both theoretical considerations and the availability of comparable data from both surveys. To capture residential and regional variations in breastfeeding behavior, we included two factors that distinguished between urban and rural residence and regions of the country. The coastal and the selva (jungle) regions were combined into one category because we found that these two regions had no significant differences in breastfeeding behavior. Both factors measured influences of modernization, access to breastmilk substitutes, and modern health care providers. Besides current residence, we included the woman's childhood place of residence.

of specifications of this variable but found no differences in the effects of agricultural, manual, and service occupations (not shown).
Our demographic variables included sex of the child, maternal age, and family composition. The family composition variable combined information on parity and the number of siblings less than five years old in the household. Young siblings may compete with the infant for the mother's time as well as for resources (e.g., food) but may also increase the value of time the mother spends at home. We experimented with a number of specifications of this variable but found no significant differences among births of orders two and above when the presence of young siblings was incorporated into the covariate; thus, birth order was merely dichotomized (first versus higher order births). We also incorporated a variable denoting the presence of older siblings (aged 7-15), who may contribute to family resources by working or providing child care. Maternal age was included to capture cohort effects. Finally, we included a variable on prior use of contraception; such practice would indicate contact with modern health care providers and, generally, would indicate less traditional attitudes toward

In the DHS, a more restrictive question was asked first: "In the past 7 days, have you worked?" Further questions, however, refined the definition of work by asking the woman whether she had worked (but was on vacation, sick leave, etc.), whether she received "cachuelo," and whether she worked in a family business or farm. We relied on all of these questions to define work in the DHS, since we believed that such a definition was closest to that specified in the WFS. Occupation was available from both surveys for currently working women.

childrearing. Preliminary analyses indicated that ever-use of modern methods was a more powerful predictor of breastfeeding behavior than current use, perhaps because the effects of current use were confounded by such factors as pregnancy, infecundity, or current desire for pregnancy.8
RESULTS
TRENDS IN BREASTFEEDING BEHAVIOR
Both breastfeeding initiation and mean duration increased in Peru between 1977 and 1986. At the time of the WFS, roughly 90 per cent of all children were ever breastfed; this proportion had increased to about 95 per cent by the time of the DHS, a decade later (Table 2). The mean duration of breastfeeding increased by 3.0 months (from 13.2 to 16.2 months)--a 22.7 per cent increase. The trends in both initiation and duration were statistically significant at a 95 per cent level. Since the death of a child could truncate the duration of breastfeeding, breastfeeding was observed to be about a month longer among children who survived to the time of the survey than among all children. Mortality among children under five declined between the two surveys (Hill and Pebley, 1989). Not surprisingly, the observed increase in duration was somewhat smaller among surviving children (2.8 months). Thus, a small portion of the increase in mean
8It could be argued that mother's work and contraceptive use were endogenous to the model and thus caused a bias in the estimated coefficients and standard errors. To test this, we examined results from models with and without these covariates. There were no important differences in the significance levels or sizes of the coefficients for any of the other explanatory variables from those presented here.

duration (0.2months) appeared tobe due to a decline in mortality (Table2).
Because our measure of mean duration combined information on whether or not the child was ever breastfed, andamong those that were, the ageat weaning, a small proportion of the observed rise in mean duration could also be attributed to theincrease in the proportion of children ever breastfed. If the increase in breastfeeding initiation were taken into account, the increase in mean age at weaning among surviving children who were ever breastfed would be about 2.2 months (WFS: 14.3/.917 = 15.6; DHS: 17.1/.958 = 17.8; calculated from Table 2) instead of 2.8 months. Thus, both breastfeeding initiation andduration clearly increased in Peru from the mid-1970's to the mid-1980's.
Table 3 provides mean durations of breastfeeding and proportions ever breastfed among surviving children by the explanatory variables of interest for both the WFS and the DHS. Both the incidence and mean duration of breastfeeding were highest in rural areas and in the sierra (the Andean mountain region) and tended to be

inversely related to socioeconomic status. Children whose mothers had ever used modern contraception (especially the pill) were considerably less likely to be breastfed--and for shorter durations--than children whose mothers hadever used modern contraception. For all categories of our explanatory variables, breastfeeding initiation and mean duration increased between the WFSand the DHS. Although increases in breastfeeding initiation could have confounded the estimates of mean duration, we should note that in only one subcategory of our explanatory variables (no siblings < 5 years old in the household) could increases in breastfeeding initiation account for the observed rise in mean duration. In most remaining subgroups, only a relatively small proportion (less than 25 per cent) of the increase in breastfeeding duration reported in Table 3could beattributed to the rise inbreastfeeding initiation. The absolute changes in both initiationand mean duration were most pronounced among children of women who were least likely to initiate breastfeeding or who breastfed for relatively short

reference category. Higher socioeconomic status was also negatively associated with breastfeeding initiation and mean duration. The effects of husband's occupation were significant, however, only for manual and service occupations compared to agriculture, Husband's education was associated negatively only with mean duration.
Two of the most striking differences between the determinants of breast-

feeding initiation and duration were related to mother's employment status and her age. First, women who worked in professional occupations breastfed for shorter durations than other women but were not less likely to initiate breastfeeding. Second, women who were older were less likely to initiate breastfeeding than younger women, but we found no significant association between maternal age and

breastfeeding duration. These results suggest a positive association between maternal age and duration among children who were ever breastfed. Competition among young siblings for mother's time did not result in shorter breastfeeding duration or lower levels of its initiation. Rather, the presence of young children was positively associated with both initiation and mean duration. The presence of older siblings also had a positive effect on breastfeeding duration, but was not associated with its initiation.
The interaction terms in the bottom of Table 4 reflect behavioral changes between the two surveys. We included in our model only interactions significant at the 10 per cent level or below. The most important changes in the determinants of breastfeeding initiation were related to the regional and residential covariates. The positive influence of residence in the sierra strengthened over time. The increment to the log-odds of ever breastfeeding increased from 0.44 in the WFS to 1.30 (0.44 + 0.86) in the DHS. Residential differentials, on the other hand, narrowed between the two surveys, although only the differential between Lima and other urban areas narrowed by a statistically significant amount. Also, although children whose fathers were in sales or service occupations were among the least likely to be breastfed in the mid-1970's, they were the most likely to be breastfed in the mid-1980's.
We also found several significant changes in the determinants of breastfeeding duration. In the mid-1970's, children of women working in professional occupations were breastfed for significantly shorter durations

than children of nonworking women (ß = -0.90). This differential was virtually nonexistent in the 1986 DHS (ß = -0.90 + 0.88 = -0.02). Differentials by husband's education were likewise eliminated. The effects estimates increased from --1.02 in the WFS to -0.20 (-1.02 + 0.82) in the DHS. The effects of husband's occupation also changed between the two surveys. In the WFS, children of manual workers breastfed for significantly shorter durations than children whose fathers worked in agriculture; in the DHS, the relationship was reversed. We also found that female children were breastfed longer than male children in the DHS but not in the WFS. Finally, ever-use of modern contraception, other than the pill, was associated with shorter breastfeeding only in the WFS; in the DHS, the effect was eliminated and perhaps even reversed.
PREDICTED INCIDENCE AND DURATION
OF BREASTFEEDING: RESULTS FROM A
SIMULATION EXERCISE
To help interpret changes in breastfeeding behavior over time, we performed a simulation exercise that calculated predicted proportions of children who were ever breastfed and mean durations of breastfeeding based on coefficients estimated separately for the two surveys.10 To do so, we calculated a predicted value for each child and then obtained a mean value for all children in the sample.11 Predicted val-
10These regressions used sample weights to accurately reflect population values.
11Predicted durations were calculated by numerically integrating the area under the survivorship curve. The height of the survivorship curve at each age was calculated by taking the anti-log of the predicted spline function.

within subgroups over time. Several important changes occurred in the population characteristics between the two surveys. For example, women's average educational attainment rose rapidly, a larger proportion of women used modern contraceptives--at least partly because of an increase in the availability of modern contraceptive methods--and women became more integrated into the labor force. Given such changes in population distribution, we might have expected decreases in breastfeeding incidence and duration. On the other hand, women

within specific subgroups may have become more likely to breastfeed, and to breastfeed for longer durations.
To examine the effect of behavioral changes within subgroups, we predicted how breastfeeding initiation and duration would have changed were breastfeeding behavior, but not the population distribution, allowed to change. This simulation could be accomplished in two ways. First, we applied the DHS coefficients to the WFS data to obtain predicted values in our simulations. These results showed what breastfeeding incidence

breastfeeding initiation and duration had behavioral changes not occurred. The proportion of infants who were ever breastfed would have declined by 1.6 percentage points, and the mean duration by 1.0 month, had there been no changes in behavior. Behavioral changes that took place during the decade, however, more than compensated for the declines predicted by shifts in population characteristics. A net increase in both breastfeeding initiation and mean duration resulted. In fact, this was true in every population subgroup. The net effect in all cases was an overall increase in the proportion of children who were ever breastfed, and in mean duration. Finally, since increases in breastfeeding initiation confound the estimates of mean duration, note that in the results based on the multivariate analysis, increases in breastfeeding initiation could not account for the rise in mean duration for any subgroup.
DISCUSSION
Most of the changes in characteristics of women between the WFS and the DHS would have predicted a decline in both breastfeeding initiation and duration in Peru. In contrast, our analyses demonstrated that both breastfeeding initiation and duration increased in Peru between 1977 and 1986. Although increases in the proportions of children who were ever breastfed accounted for a small portion of the observed rise in mean duration, in no subcategory of interest did such increases account for all of the observed rise in mean duration.
Furthermore, although changes in the distribution of women across pop-

ulation subgroups would have been expected to lead to decreases in both the proportion of children who were ever breastfed and the mean duration of breastfeeding, the potential for decline was more than overcome by changes in behavior. For all categories of our explanatory variables, we found a net increase in breastfeeding initiation and duration. The largest absolute increases in both initiation and duration generally occurred among children of women who were least likely to initiate breastfeeding and who breastfed for shorter durations than other women. These findings were similar to those reported by Grummer-Strawn (1991a) for a number of other developing countries. Our results thus suggest that declines in breastfeeding initiation and duration that are attributable to modernization in developing countries are not inevitable. This fact has important implications for health policy makers and those concerned with such potential declines in developing countries.
Two factors could account for the increases we found in breastfeeding initiation and duration in Peru between 1977 and 1986. In the 1980's, the Ministry of Health began breastfeeding promotion campaigns and encouraged breastfeeding during diarrheal episodes as a key component of its policy to combat diarrheal morbidity and mortality (Altobelli, 1988; Instituto Nacional de Estadística, 1988). Because the effectiveness of such campaigns likely depends on access to health care professionals and the news media, increases in breastfeeding initiation and duration among urban women, among highly educated women, and among women who were users of modern contraceptives (and

242

Elo and Grummer-Strawn

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

thus had contact with modern health care professionals) may indeed reflect that the campaigns are having a positive impact. The severe economic downturn during the first half of the 1980's may also have played a role in increasing both breastfeeding initiation and duration, since breast milk may have served as a substitute for other infant foods. Economic circumstances are likely to have influenced behavior among the poor and the uneducated. Like the more socioeconomically advantaged women, these women were more likely to ever breastfeed their children and to have done so for longer durations in the mid-1980's than a decade earlier, although the increases were of smaller magnitude.
The reasons behind the observed changes in behavior have important implications for future trends. If the

economy is a key factor here, we might expect some decline in breastfeeding initiation and duration, at least among the poor, if the economy improves. On the other hand, if breastfeeding promotion campaigns are responsible for the observed changes in behavior, the increases are more likely to have a lasting impact.
