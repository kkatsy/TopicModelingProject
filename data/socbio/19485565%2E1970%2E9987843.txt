sophistication among users of other methods in interpreting the question of how long it takes to become pregnant. Neither of these explanations, however, accounts for the finding that pregnancy appears more likely in the third month than the second, and more likely in the fourth than the third, after discontinuance of the pill. It is the pill-users' pattern which is abnormal (see Fig. 1) and unexpected, so that it seems more likely that some factor is acting to depress their fecundability than that the results for other users are distorted.

We have assumed that there are two populations of pill-users, one of which (approximately 80% of users) is unaffected by the use of the pill and exhibits the same probabilities of conception, month by month, as users of other methods. The other population experiences a carry-over of the contraceptive effect of the pill either for two or for three months after discontinuance (half of the population for two months, and half for three months).
Table 2 shows the monthly probabilities of conception deduced from this model and

We therefore conclude that for 20% of women using the pill there is a delay of either two or three months before their capacity toconceive isrestored. This ismost probably due to thepersistence forthis time of anovulatory cycles, and we look forward to clinical evidence of this phenomenon.
