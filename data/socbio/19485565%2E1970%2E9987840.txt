Among human populations, the selection of a spouse is conditioned by many factors involving not only natural but cultural determinants. The social regulation of marriage, common to all human societies, narrows the range of potential spouses in a way which interferes with random mating. At the genotypic level, this nonrandomness is referred to as inbreeding (Li, 1961; Wallace, 1968) and is a function of the frequency of consanguineous marriages. At the phenotypic level, nonrandom mating is referred to as assortative mating (Falconer, 1961; Wallace, 1968) and is usually ascribed to the exercise of "choice" in spouse selection, though genetic relationships may be a factor as well (Crow and Felsenstein, 1968).
Many studies have detected significant amounts of phenotypic assortative mating for traits such as education, intelligence, religion (Burgess and Wallin, 1943; Garrison, Anderson, and Reed, 1968), many of which have no heritability at all. However, other authors have detected assortative mating for physical characteristics, most notably height and weight (see summary article by Spuhler, 1968). These associations, measured by the magnitude of the coefficient of correlations between spouses,

have been low positive and led Spuhler to conclude that "the degree of assortative mating experienced in contemporary European peoples probably has a small influence on the population distribution of inherited physical characteristics" (p. 139).
In his comprehensive survey, Spuhler, however, found only two non-European populations sampled, the Ramah Navaho and the Japanese. Neither sample yielded significant associations for height or weight. However, neither of these groups represents small, isolated, primitive populations. In such small populations, interruptions in random mating could have a more profound effect on the distribution of genotypes and permit greater changes in gene frequency through the action of selection, drift, or differential migration. For this reason, I have undertaken an analysis of phenotypic assortative mating among just such a population, the Cashinahua Indians of the Peruvian rain forest.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The Peruvian Cashinahua are a small unacculturated tribal isolate who live along the Curanja River, a tributary of the Purus, in northeastern Peru, a few miles from the

In 1966, when the anthropométrie data were gathered, they numbered but 206 individuals grouped into three neighboring, but endogamous, villages They have been described demographically and genetically in previous publications (Johnston et al., 1968; 1969a; 1969&; Jantz et al., 1969) emanating from our 1966 studies, and repetition is not necessary. It should be noted, however, that, due to small population size, village endogamy, and

polygyny, considerable pressure is exerted upon both men and women to marry. Almost all women are married before puberty; our census showed no females unmarried who were over 14 years of age, while only 4 of 12 males between IS and 19 were single and none beyond 19.
A single observer measured all inhabitants of the three villages, except for the infants. Since our demographic data indicated that, in the population, there were 42 females who were or had been the first wives of 42 male villagers, this made possible the study of assortative mating within these pairs. The degree of phenotypic association between men and their first wives was determined by the product-moment r, calculated for the following variables:
1. Age, as estimated from detailed ethnographic records, to the nearest year.

2. Stature (in centimeters). 3. Weight (in kilograms). As there were four
females among the 42 who were pregnant, sample size was reduced to 38 for this dimension. 4. Bi-epicondylar diameter of the humerus (in mm.). This variable was selected as one measurement highly unlikely to show any assortative mating. 5. Body fat, as estimated from the sum of the triceps and subscapular skinfolds. Since measures of body fat are highly skewed, normalized values obtained by a logarithmic transformation (Edwards, 1955) were utilized.
In addition, to provide an additional control, the males were paired at random with females of the sample; stature within these random pairs was correlated.
Assortative mating may be a consequence of genetic relationship (Crow and Felsenstein, 1968), as well as the exercise of any choice in mate selection. The small effective population size (Ne = 61; Johnston et al., 1969¿>) and the estimated coefficients of inbreeding (F = 0.024), when considered in the light of the high rate (86%) of village endogamy, made this a possible cause of any detectable assortative mating. To control this aspect, I investigated the existence of any nonrandomness in mating types among my sample at the haptoglobin locus. The distribution of the six possible mating types was compared to that expected under conditions of random mating.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the comparisons of observed and expected distributions of mating types at the haptoglobin locus. It can be seen that the two distributions do not differ significantly, as indicated by the x2 of 1.226.
Table 2 presents the correlations obtained for the above-mentioned variables. It can be seen that the highest coefficient is for the association between the age of a man and his first wife (r.= 0.759). This is not unexpected and falls within the range reported by Spuhler (1968) for 14 samples, though considerably below the value of 0.99

which he found among the Ramah Navaho. A positive correlation, significant at the
0.025 level, exists among the Cashinahua for the stature of a man and his first wife (r = 0.346). This becomes more notable when compared to the random pairs correlation of -0.009.
Weight is positively correlated among the husbands and wives of my sample at an r of 0.313, quite close to the values obtained for stature. However, this is not simply a matter of body fat, since the correlation for fat, as estimated by the sum of triceps andsubscapular skinfolds, is not significantly different from zero (0.020).

might, in part, be affected by age. (Nine of the females in the sample were less than 20 years of age.)
Table 3 presents the age-constant partial correlations of husband/wife height and husband/wife weight. Two partial correlations are given for each measurement, since the results depend upon whether the wife or the husband is used as the source of the dependent variable. Regardless of which spouse is used, the within-measurement partial correlations are similar; correlations for height are likewise similar to those for weight. In every case but one, removing the effect of age reduces the initial values of r

More cryptic anthropométrie variables do not seem to be correlated, as indicated by the association of the breadth of the elbow joint (r = --0.025; not significant).
The apparently simple relationship between a husband's stature or weight and that of his first wife is complicated by the fact that both height and weight are positively correlated with age.This is particularly true in the Cashinahua, since marriages occur at very early ages. Due to the delayed rates of maturation noted among children of this group (ms.in preparation) a significant amount of growth in height and weight occurs after marriage. In view of the high association between husband and wife's ages, it seemed more than possible that the high correlations obtained for stature and weight

to non-significant levels, although they approach the 0.05 level. Thus the 0.346, obtained for stature, is reduced to 0.296 and 0.239. The correlation for weight is reduced from 0.313 to 0.245 when the husband's age is used; however, when the wife's ageis used, the partial correlation is the same as the original one, 0.313.
DISCUSSION
The mating systems of small, relatively isolated populations differ from those of large communities or nations with high population densities. In many non-Western societies such as the Cashinahua, the difference is further magnified by a marked regulation of marriage along kinship lines. The ideal marriage among the Cashinahua is

40

endogamous with respect to village, but exogamous with respect to moiety. Also, a man may not marry a woman one generation removed from his.
Although deviations from this "ideal" do occur, they represent only about 17% of 90 recorded marriages (Johnston et al., 1969). Even when tolerated, such unions are looked upon with suspicion, and resulting pregnancies may frequently be terminated through the use of abortive drugs.

sortative mating for stature is not present. The correlation of randomized pairs in the sample, which would also remove the effects of age (the total age range was from 12 to 5 0 + years old), resulted in a correlation for stature of --0.009. When compared to the partial, age-constant correlations of 0.296 and 0.239, this suggests that some positive assortative mating may exist.
The same holds true for weight. In fact, if the age of the wife is used in computing

Thus, in such populations, deviations from panmixia become more numerous and potentially more important in leading to evolutionary change. Phenotypic assortative mating, if present, can be a more important factor under these conditions than in the large, modern groups usually sampled.
The detection of assortative mating for stature and weight among the Peruvian Cashinahua is complicated by the relationship of both variables to age. When the effects of age are removed, of the four resulting partial r's only the one for weight remains significant. The others are reduced to levels which, at best, are of borderline significance.
This does not mean that positive as-

the partial correlation, there is no reduction in the presumably age-independent value of 0.313. This failure of the partial r to reduce the original one is due to the fact that the correlation of the weight of the husband and the age of the wife is quite low (0.215). On the other hand, the correlation of the age of the husband and the weight of the wife is considerably higher (0.454), due to the greater tendency of females to become fatter with age (ms. in preparation).
It is difficult from these data to determine the nature of the age effect. It is possible that the effect is merely a statistical one, that is, that the average amount of size increase between adolescence, when marriages occur, and the cessation of growth is such

The effects of assortative mating upon the genetic structure and eventual evolutionary dynamics of the Cashinahua are,for the above reasons, not completely clear. Certainly themagnitude of the correlations are all low and the explained variance is quite small. On the other hand, if there is
