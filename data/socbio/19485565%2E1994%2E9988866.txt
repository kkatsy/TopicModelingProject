The Gruter Institute for Law and Behavioral Research and the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for the Social Sciences at Dartmouth College are pleased to announce the Second Annual Faculty Seminar on Biological
Perspectives in the Social Sciences at Dartmouth College from Saturday, August 13 (evening) to Friday, August 19 (noon). Directed by Roger D. Masters (Department of Government, Dartmouth), visiting lecturers will represent diverse fields in the biological and social sciences. Afternoon and evening programs will include roundtable sessions with participants as well as free time for individual meetings with the lecturers. The seminar is limited to 40 participants.
Although lecturers for 1994 are not yet confirmed, last year staff included Robert Trivers (Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz); Michael T. McGuire (Neuropsychology, UCLA); Miguel Marin-Padilla (Neuroscience, Dartmouth Medical School); Lionel Tiger (Anthropology, Rutgers); Helen Fisher (American Museum of Natural History, New York); Robert Frank

(Economics, Cornell); E. Donald Elliott (Yale Law School); and Edward Berger (Biology, Dartmouth). Participants in 1993 included scholars in economics, sociology, political science, anthropology, and psychology from both the United States and Europe.
Single dormitory rooms, with shared bath, have been reserved at Dartmouth College at $35 per day with maid service (if desired, other lodging accommodations in the Hanover area are available); participants purchase meals through the College dining services. There will be a registration fee ($100). A limited number of grants covering the cost of room, board, and registration, are available to scholars or graduate students whose research or teaching utilizes theories and findings from the life sciences.
