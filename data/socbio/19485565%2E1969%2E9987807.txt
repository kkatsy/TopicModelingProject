Census underenumeration of teen-age males is believed to be substantial. Siegel (1968) estimates the net undercount of males of ages 15-19 at 4.7% in 1960 and at 5.1% in 1950, and other investigators have suggested similar or higher percentages (Coale, 1955; Zelnik, 1964; Siegel and Zelnik, 1966). As registration for Selective Service has been continuous and mandatory since 1948, these annual data appear to provide an independent basis for evaluating the accuracy of the census counts or extensions of them in the relevant ages over a period of years.1
Although it would be possible to make annual comparisons of the number of Selective Service registrants with postcensal and intercensal estimates of the population in the appropriate ages based on census counts, it seems desirable to make a somewhat different comparison involving fewer uncertainties as to how the Selective Service
1 The present study complements a recent article by M. Zelnik on "The Census and Selective Service." After summarizing the findings of earlier studies (Price, 1947; Myers, 1948) which attempted to evaluate census data (for 1940, in particular) for young adult males on the basis of Selective Service data, Zelnik compares the number of Selective Service registrants in 1950 and 1960 with the equivalent figures derived from the 1950 and 1960 censuses. He concludes that the Selective Service data for these years are themselves so deficient that they are inadequate for the purpose.

figures should relate to census figures. Accordingly, the present study compares the annual increase in the number of Selective Service registrants with estimates of the number of males reaching 18 annually from 1949-50 to date.
The intercensal and postcensal estimates of the population reaching age 18 from 1949-50 to 1967-68 are based on census counts of the population from age 8 to 28 in either the 1950 or 1960 census depending on the number of calendar years from each census and the type of estimate, whether intercensal or postcensal. For example, the approximate age on census dates of the cohorts reaching age 18 in selected years is given in Table 1. The estimates for the intercensal years relate to combinations of shifting ages, with increasing weight being given to age in 1960 as the year of estimate approaches 1960 or increasing weight being given to the age in 1950 as the year of estimate approaches 1950.
The comparisons between the censusbased estimates and the annual change in Selective Service registrants are admittedly only approximate since the Selective Service figures are not available in the detail necessary to develop strictly comparable figures

the Selective Service data indicate a net undercount in the census figures for certain ages in these years. It is more likely, however, that these large differences, especially that for 1950-51, resulted from the increased pressure on 18-year-olds to register and the delayed registrations of youths over age 18 on the occasion of the Korean conflict.
From the years 1954-55 to 1964-65 the relationship between the two series was fairly close, being within about 4% of agreement each year. Generally, the annual increase in registrations exceeded the census estimates from 1954-45 through 1964-65, but in three of these years the net increase in living registrants fell short of the census estimates.
For the eleven-year period as a whole, the net increase in living registrants of 15,077,000 exceeded the census estimate by only about 155,000, or 1%. The year 196566 again saw a forward surge in Selective Service registrations, presumably due to the tightening of the military situation in Vietnam.
The net increase in registrations may be represented as

Ri - Ro = / - O,

(1)

There are other components which affect the above estimates of / and O, but they are small and tend largely to offset one another. The new registrants in fact include: (1) persons leaving military service who entered by enlistment at age 17; (2) persons leaving institutions who were in institutions on reaching 18. The new registrants thus exclude: (1) persons who reached age 18 in military service after enlisting at age 17; (2) persons in institutions on reaching 18.
The enlistment of 17-year-olds (and some 18-year-olds) before registration occurs may cause fluctuations in the annual registration figures, but it should not affect the overall level of the figures over a period of years because these men must register once they leave military service. The same is true of men in institutions, since they must register upon release.
Disregarding the components just listed and using the symbols previously introduced, we can solve equation (1) in terms of the number of men reaching age 18 as follows:

Ri = Ro =

- d - me. (2)

If m (net immigrants) = w,- --me, then 1,8 = Ri-Ro + (d- m). (3)

where
Ri = living registrants at end of year; Ra = living registrants at beginning of
year; 7 = number of new registrants (equal
essentially to the number of males reaching 18 in the year (lig) and immigrants 18 and over entering the U.S. registration area during the year (mi)); 0 = number of "departing" registrants (equal essentially to deaths (d) in the year to registrants, and registered emigrants 18 and over departing from the U.S. registration area during the year (me)).

That is, the number of males reaching age 18 equals the net increases in registrations plus the difference between deaths and net immigrants. The comparison in Table 2 assumes that the difference between net immigrants and deaths approximates zero.
Let us examine in detail the factors which weaken the comparison made in Table 2. Although young men reaching age 18 form the bulk of new registrants, an unknown proportion register at other ages. For example, those 18-year-olds who have already enlisted in the Armed Forces at age 17 legally need not register until they complete their military service. They may be somewhat lax about registering even then without get-

ting into serious trouble with the Selective Service System.
The number of 17-year-olds delaying registration until after completion of military service may be inferred from the number of 17-year-olds in the Armed Forces each year. The annual average for the eleven years from 1955 through 1965 was 54,000, with a low of 37,000 and a high of 88,000. Related to the registration for any one "fiscal" year, fluctuations from this factor could thus account for up to 3 % variation (since the average size of the 18-year-old group was 1,300,000 during the period), even though in the long run nonregistration of 17year-old volunteers would be canceled out by post-service registrations.
The same thing is probably true of the registration of institutional inmates, who are required to register only upon leaving the institution. In 1960 there were about 12,000 males aged 18 in the types of institutions specified in the Selective Service regulations. One would expect much less year-to-year fluctuation from this factor than from military enlistment of 17-year-olds.
Other factors weakening our comparison between the census estimates and Selective Service data are the registration of immigrant aliens and the removal from the list of deceased or emigrating registrants. Since all alien immigrants born after September 15, 1925 are supposed to register for Selective Service within six months of arrival in the United States, the age range of immigrants subject to registration expands with the passage of time.3
Since immigration has been relatively constant during the period examined, the size of the annual immigration group subject to registration has grown at something like the rate at which the number of living regis-

trants has grown, since both groups are adding years to the older end of the age range. By coincidence, the number of immigrants 18 years and over and estimated annual deaths of registrants are about equal and change through time in the same manner. Rough estimates for the age cohorts involved suggest 62,000 deaths and about the same number of immigrants for 1963-64, 42,000 deaths and 43,000 immigrants for 1959-60, and 20,000 deaths and 14,000 immigrants for 1950-51. Emigration of registrants has been a minor factor and may be disregarded for the present purpose.
Theoretically, we should make allowance for the two factors of death and immigration in the estimates in Table 2; for example, by adding deaths of registrants to net change in living registrants (giving gross registrations) and then subtracting alien immigrants in the registration ages. However, because of the approximate equality between the two categories, we have ignored them in our comparison. In fact, both categories are probably incompletely reflected in Selective Service statistics to a considerable degree. Immigrants are told of their duty to register when applying for a visa, but only when applying for naturalization papers are they systematically required to register. Naturalizations for the period 1956 through 1963 represent about one-half of the number of alien immigrants admitted five years before. Those immigrants over 26 years of age would probably not be in serious trouble for failing to register under the conditions prevailing from 1955 to 1965. With respect to deaths, there is no formal procedure for notifying the Selective Service System of the deaths of a registrant. The local boards rely on relatives or friends of the deceased to notify them; yet perhaps more than one-fifth of registrants over age 23 no longer reside in the same state of residence as they did at age ·18.

the Department of Defense believes that there may be a considerable duplicatior. in the Selective Service data, resulting particularly from the high mobility of. young rr en. Some duplications are eventually detected and subtracted from the total in obtaining the net registration figure. However, the greater part probably remain undetected.
Since it is impossible to measure adequately the degree of incompleteness of the registration of immigrants, the number of unreported deaths of registrants, and the number of duplications in Selective Service data, the practical assumption employed in the comparison developed in Table 2 is that the annual number of unregistered alien immigrants equals the number of unreported deaths and that there are no duplications. If there actually were more unrepoited deaths than unregistered aliens, then the annual change in registration as shown in Table 2 is high in relation to the nuirber reaching age 18 in the table; in the reverse case, annual change in registration is low in relation to the number reaching age l'i in the table (see equation [3]).
In view of the crude assumptions which one must make in order to compare the census estimates with Selective Services statistics on an annual basis, it is reasonable to conclude only that the per cent of completeness of the two series is about equal. The hypothesis that Selective Service registrations are not complete is supported by the sharp excess of the increase in registrants over the estimates of males reaching age 18

during the three years of conflict in Korea, and then again as the Vietnam conflict intensified in 1965-66. This excess suggests that some males who should have registered earlier did so as a result of a sharpened awareness of the demands of military service. In the "normal" situation, as from 1954-55 through 1964-65, there are fairly large compensating factors affecting the number of registrants and the census and Selective Service series show little difference. These factors make it impossible to determine the degree of error in the census estimates in any precise way.
Unfortunately, no figures are available showing gross registrations, nor are separate figures available for Whites and Nonwhites. If gross figures on registration were available by color, it might be possible to evaluate the accuracy of the data more definitely, at least for the Nonwhites. A recent estimate of the net undercount of Nonwhite males aged 15-19 is 12.5% in 1960 and 15.2% in 1950 (Siegel, 1968).In 1952, race classification was removed from the basic reporting forms, and no data of this kind have been recorded or tabulated since that time. The Selective Service Research Division has some data on the race of registrants for the period 1948 to 1952, but in view of the apparent deficiency of total registrants for this period as outlined above these data may be of limited value. In addition, Myers (1948) has pointed out serious inaccuracies in race classification in World War II Selective Service statistics, inaccuracies which may have carried over into the period after 1948.
