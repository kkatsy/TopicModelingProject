ABSTRACT: Marital distance, exogamy, inbreeding, admixture, and fertility were studied in 513 families of mixed and unmixed Arabian origin living in São José do Rio Preto, Brazil. The 212 unmixed Arabian families were divided into two subgroups: 83 couples married before migration and 129 couples married after migration. The exogamy index and marital distance were significantly higher for the couples married after migration, and the coefficients of inbreeding for both autosomal and sex-linked genes were also higher for this subgroup. Admixture was studied in 301 families, most of which were comprised of an Arabian man married to a non-Arabian woman. The frequency of mixed marriages has increased in recent years. The unmixed Arabian group has a significantly higher fertility, but it seems to be dependent upon cultural changes over the years.

The history of migration to Brazil shows roughly two kinds of immigrant groups: those who mix more easily with the recipient population (Italian, Portuguese, Spanish) and those who have a tendency to remain as genetic isolates (Japanese, Jews, Dutch). The kind of relationship between Brazilians and immigrants seems to be determined to a large extent by the communities into which the immigrants have moved as well as by their distribution in urban or rural areas (Saldanha et al., 1960; Freire-Maia et al., 1960; Saldanha, 1962; Beiguelman, 1964). Cultural and biological assimilation naturally takes place slowly when the immigrants settle as isolated colonies.
Immigration often causes changes in gene frequencies, particularly when the immigrants come from geographical regions distant from the receiving population. However, attempts to avoid mixed marriages can also lead to unions involving people of the same ethnic origin, but from geographical regions farther apart than those that would have been involved if the marriage had occurred in the land of

origin. This fact can cause an apparent paradox, the breakdown of the "isolate" within itself.
After World War I, a current of Arabian migration to Brazil began, with most of the immigrants being settled in the southern states. This movement lasted until World War II, when the incentives formerly offered by the Brazilian government were eliminated, and the political, religious, and economic causes that had stimulated the enormous emigration of Arabs ceased (Knowlton, 1960). This report summarizes data on marital distance, exogamy, inbreeding, admixture, and fertility obtained among Arabian immigrants and their descendants who live in a southern Brazilian town. Other genetic and anthropological information gathered will be presented elsewhere.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total of S13 families of Arabian origin, living in the urban area of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, were divided into two groups: Group I, 212 families of unmixed

Arabian origin, comprised of 83 couples married before immigrating (Subgroup la) and 129 couples married in Brazil (Subgroup ft); and Group II, 301 families with admixture. The Arabian immigrants in both groups were mostly from Lebanon (84.1 per cent) and Syria (13.9 per cent).
Marital distance, the exogamy index, the consanguinity rate, and inbreeding were studied in Group I; aspects of admixture were studied in Group II. Fertility was studied in both groups.
Data were collected on the number and sex of live-born and living children born during the first twenty years of marriage, by five-year periods, to women now past reproductive age (over age 45).
A sample of 12,100 non-Arabian couples, married in the urban area of Sao Jose do Rio Preto from 1948 to 1969, was studied to estimate the inbreeding rate of Brazilians in this region.
For each Arabian family, consanguinity data were obtained by interviews with one or both consorts. For the non-Arabian sample, information on consanguinity was drawn from Roman Catholic Church records. In order to marry, a couple must ask for a dispensation if they are second cousins once removed or more closely related. Nearly all marriages in the town are Catholic.

RESULTS
The average straight-line distances between birthplaces for the 83 couples married before migration (Subgroup la) and for the 129 couples married after migration (Subgroup 16) were 5.4 ± 1.4 km. and 33.4 ± 3.5 km. {t = 8.09, 210 df, P < 0.001). Similarly, the exogamy index, defined here as the frequency of marriages involving immigrants born in different localities, was higher in Subgroup 16 (67 per cent) than in Subgroup la (18 per cent).
Table 1 shows the frequencies of consanguineous and nonconsanguineous marriages in Subgroups la and ft. Although they do not differ significantly (x2 = 0.64, 1 df, P > 0.30), the mean coefficients of inbreeding for autosomal genes are strikingly different (0.00245 and 0.008S4 for subgroups la and ft, respectively), the same being true for the mean coefficients of inbreeding for sex-linked genes(O.OO5O8 and 0.01078).
The coefficient of inbreeding for the Brazilian population as a whole was estimated by Freire-Maia (1957) as 0.00200. Presumably because of the town's recent remarkable growth from extensive internal migration, the Catholic sample of Sao Jose do Rio Preto showed a very low fre-

and a sample taken from the same group in which the couples had more than fifteen years of cohabitation (98 couples in the sample from Group I and 219 couples from Group II). Significant differences were found when the comparison was made in Group I (x2 = 20.83, 11 df, P < 0.05), but not in Group II (x2 = 7.01, 10 df, P > 0.70). This result suggests the existence within Group I of two kinds of families: older families with more than fifteen years of cohabitation and with a large number of children, and younger families with a smaller number of children.
The average number of live-born children for prolific post-reproductive women of unmixed Arabian origin was 4.6. While birth control has been practiced in recent years by some families in Brazil, the birth rate for the population as a whole according to the 1970 census (Fundagao IBGE, 1972) was still 5.4, one of the world's highest.
At first glance, the greater fertility of the unmixed Arabian group compared to the

mixed group could be attributed to ethnic factors or to nonhybridity. However, when the fertility of the 28 pairs of brothers married to Arabian and nonArabian women is examined, the fertility difference between mixed and unmixed couples is not maintained. Considering the similar age at marriage for women in the mixed and unmixed groups, the ten-year difference in mean age for couples with completed families in the two groups, and the evidence of fertility reduction through time in both groups, it seems that sociocultural variables were influential in determining final fertility.
