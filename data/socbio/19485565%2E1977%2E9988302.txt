ABSTRACT: A survey of 1,155 girls aged 10 through 20 was conducted in a rural area of Bangladesh in March, 1976, to assess the impact of nutritional status on the onset of menarche and the association between age at menarche and age at marriage. In recent years there has been an increased age at onset of menarche which appears to have been associated with malnutrition caused by war, postwar inflation, floods, and famine in the period 1971-76. Body weight was highly correlated with the age of onset of menarche. A seasonal trend in onset of menarche was noted with the peak occurring in the winter months corresponding to the largest annual rice harvest. An increased age of marriage was also noted, which may be correlated with the increased age of menarche.

The age of menarche in developed countries has declined in the last hundred years. This decline has been attributed to improved diets, lowered rates of infection, and improved environmental and sanitary conditions (Tanner, 1968; Cagas and Riley, 1970). Numerous studies in both technologically advanced and developing countries have focused on the variables affecting the onset of menarche. None of these studies, however, has examined menarche in relation to worsening external conditions and the effect adverse changes can have on the onset of menarche.
Bangladesh offers an unique opportunity for the study of such a situation because since independence (1971), the socioeconomic condition of the country has declined. For the past five years, there has generally been a decreasing per capita dietary intake. Chen and Chaudhury (1975) estimated that the per capita intake of calories declined from 1,715 in 1960-65 to 1,680 in 1965-70 and 1,618 in 1970-74; and the average per capita protein intake declined from 43.4 g in 1960-65 to 42.5 g

in 1965-70 and 40.6 g in 1970-74. The quality of protein consumed has also declined during this period.
Using FAO/WHO standards, adjusting for body weight, climate, activity, and making allowances for lactation and pregnancy, Chen (1975) calculated that the minimal per capita consumption necessary for health is 1,600 calories and 40 g protein. These calculations illustrate that if available food were distributed among the population according to need, each person would have only the minimum requirement. However, as was shown in the National Nutritional Survey of 1962-64, more than half of the rural population consumed less than their calorie and protein requirements (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1966, pp. 232-243). This study was conducted more than ten years ago when more food per capita was available. It is probable that due to the worsening economic conditions, the disparity in distribution is even greater at present, with an even larger proportion of the rural poor con-

present nutritional status and age of menarche. In a ten-year prospective study of sexual development in American girls age 8-10, Zacharias et al. (1976) related onset of menarche to body build. They reported a significant positive correlation between the ponderal index, a function of height and weight, and age of menarche. It is suggested that a girl's age of menarche is more closely associated to her shape than to her size; late menarche is associated with thinness and early menarche with heaviness. Dreizen et al. (1967) observed in a U.S. study that well-nourished girls had an average age of menarche of 12.43, compared to 14.45 among poorly nourished girls.

The 1974 census data for the 132 villages was used as the sampling frame for this study. The study was designed to interview over a thousand girls aged 10 to 20 years, irrespective of their marital status. A purposeful pick of 13 villages was chosen to provide a larger proportion of Hindus than normally found in this population. A list was prepared of girls aged 8-18 in the 1974 census residing in 13 villages. The initial survey conducted in March, 1976, obtained information on 1,155 girls whose ages at the time of the study were 10-20 years.

F, = 5.65 + 0.67X, (Muslim); 7 2 = 5.83 + 0.68 X2 (Hindu).
These equations illustrate that Muslims and Hindus have similar coefficients and near equal ages of menarche.
Table 2 shows the distribution of girls by age, body weight, and percentage who have reached menarche. This table clearly reflects that both age and weight arerelated to the proportion reaching menarche. When ageis controlled for, theprominent effect of weight on menstrual status is evident. When weight is controlled for, the relationship of age is less striking, though still positively correlated to menstrual status. Overall, 98 per cent of the girls whose weights were 40 kg(88 lbs.) or greater had reached menarche, compared to only 1 per cent of those weighing less than 30 kg (66 lbs.).

years. When body weight is controlled for, height shows little relationship to the proportion reaching menarche. However, when height is controlled for, weight shows a significant relationship to the per cent of girls attaining menarche. Again, body weight seems to be one of the most important factors for the determination of onset of menarche.
A seasonal pattern of onset of menarche was observed in this study. Of the girls who attained menarche, 49.4 per cent reported doing so in the months of November through February, whereas only 19.3 per cent attained menarche in the months May through August. The months of November through February encompass the

winter season when food prices are low and staples such as rice are abundantly available in Bangladesh (Chen et al., 1974). It is possible that the nutritional status of the population improves at this time, leading to increases in body weight necessary for the initiation of menarche.
Table 5 presents the cumulative per cent distribution of girls who attained menarche by their year of birth and age of onset of menarche. This table illustrates that those who were born in 1960 or earlier have a different distribution of onset of menarche than the cohort born after 1960. Those who were born after 1960 exhibit a cumulative distribution of onset of menarche parallel to their older cohort, though shifted later by at least one year. The average age of menarche for the cohort born in 1961 or later will be at least one year older than the previous cohort if this pattern continues. This younger group (1961-66 cohort) was 5-10 years old when they experienced the famine of 1971-72 and 8-13 years old when they were subsequently confronted by another severe famine in 1974-75. During 1971-75, Bangladesh faced war, postwar inflation, floods,and famines which resulted in economic crises for the country. These events

Table 6 illustrates the relationship of marriage with menarche, controlling for age. It indicates that the proportion of ever-married girls is much higher among

some girls of this type who in fact are older. The single-year age distribution shown in Table 1apparently reflects little of this type of bias.

earlier. In a similar study, Damon and Bajema (1971) reported that the age of menarche was recalled after 39 years to be two years earlier than the actual event. However, they conclude that recalled age of menarche is accurate enough for epidemiological purposes. It is interesting to note among South African Bantus, Kark (1943) observed that older girls reported a later age of menarche than younger girls. She suggests this difference was due to inaccuracy of recall. If this were the case in our sample, the older girls would have begun menses even earlier than reported.
CONCLUSIONS
1. In recent years in a rural area of Bangladesh, the age of onset of menarche has increased.
2. This increase seems to be associated with malnutrition caused by the war, postwar inflation, floods, and famines during the period 1971-75.
3. Body weight is one of the most important factors associated with age of onset of menarche.
4. There exists a seasonality of onset of menarche with a peak in winter.

5. Age of marriage among this rural population has increased and may be associated with the increasing age of menarche.
6. Since both age of menarche and age of marriage have increased, it may be expected that fertility among females age 15-19 will decrease in the future if this pattern continues.
