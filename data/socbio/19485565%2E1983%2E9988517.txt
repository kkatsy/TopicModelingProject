ABSTRACT: Various studies on marriage patterns in India have indicated that the incidence of consanguineous marriages varies according to linguistic groups. This study was carried out in an area of culture contact of several different linguistic groups. A study of five endogamous tribal groups showed that the degree of consanguinity and type of consanguineous marriages were closely related to the linguistic area to which each population belonged. The Raj Gonds, Kolams, and Pradhans had a high inbreeding coefficient similar to that of rural populations of Andhra Pradesh; the Andhs showed a lower coefficient similar to that of Maharashtra, their area of origin; and the Mathuras, a nomadic North Indian group, showed a very low inbreeding coefficient, which is characteristic of North India.

guistic affinities with them. The Raj Gonds speak Gondi, and the Kolams speak Kolami, both being dialects of the Dravidian group of languages (Emeneau, 1955).
The Pradhans are closely associated with the Raj Gonds as their bards and geneologists. They are bilingual, speaking Marathi among themselves, and also speaking Gondi fluently, reciting poems in Gondi. They are treated as an untouchable caste in Maharashtra (Hivale, 1946). Although the Raj Gonds do not treat them as an untouchable group, they consider the Pradhans inferior and do not eat food cooked by them.
The other two groups, the Andhs and Mathuras, are recent migrants to Utnoor taluka. The Andhs are a Marathispeaking group of settled agriculturists, a small group having migrated from the Nanded, Parbhani, and Yeotmal districts of Maharashtra State to settle in villages nearer the taluka headquarters. The Maturas are a nomadic group of salt traders and cattle rearers, who claim a history of migration from North India. They are said to be a subcaste of the Banjaras (Russel and Hiralal, 1916, Vol. II) to whom they have a close cultural and linguistic affinity. Like the Andhs, they have settled in villages close to the taluka headquarters along the main communication networks.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data were collected according to a multi-stage sampling technique. Each of the five groups was treated separately so as to constitute a universe within which villages were the first-stage units and adult individuals within the villages were the second-stage units. The total number of married couples surveyed were 397,283,114,99, and 93 in the Raj

Gonds, Kolams, Pradhans, Andhs, and Mathuras respectively. The type and time of marriage as well as place of birth of the spouses was collected. The marriage distance was calculated in kilometers by recording the road distance between the place of birth of spouses. The average inbreeding coefficient a was defined (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971) as 2P,F; where P, is the proportion of each type of consanguinous marriage and Fito the inbreeding coefficient, i.e., the probability that two genes in the offspring are identical by descent from one common ancestor.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The highest average inbreeding coefficients were found in the Pradhans, Kolams, and Raj Gonds, being 0.032, 0.028, and 0.021 respectively. The coefficients were lower in the two immigrant populations, the Andhs from Maharashtra and the Mathuras from North India, being 0.0145 and 0.0047 (Table 1). The inbreeding coefficients of the three local tribal populations of Andhra Pradesh were comparable to those of the rural populations of the northeastern part of Andhra Pradesh to which this area of study belongs.
The consanguinous marriages were predominantly of the first-cousin type (cross-cousins) with a negligible number of uncle-niece or other related marriages. In all these tribal populations, except the Mathuras, the cross-cousin type of first-cousin marriage is the most prevalent. This type of marriage is a general feature of the kinship systems of most South Indian populations as well as of tribal populations of Central India and Northeastern India. The major tribes of Central India, such as the Bhils and Gonds as well as the Northeastern

tribes, such as the Nagas (except Angamas), Galongs, Daflas, and Miris, practice cross-cousin marriages. Besides a preference for consanguinous marriages, low occupational mobility in these groups may also account for the very high frequency of consanguinous marriages in these four groups. Although the Mathuras migrated from North India where consanguinous marriages are taboo, the practice of firstcousin marriage on a small scale may be due to restricted choice in a small population which has taken up settled cultivation and left its original nomadic activity, hence becoming isolated from the rest of its group.
Since age at marriage was difficult to obtain accurately in these populations, whose members are not literate, the time of marriage was determined by whether it occurred before or after menarche (first menstruation) which is an important event that can be easily remembered. The frequency of marriages before menarche was highest in the Andhs, Raj Gonds, and Pradans, being 88 per cent, 79 per cent and 71 per cent respectively (Table 2). It was much lower in the Kolams and Mathuras, being 52 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. The high frequency of marriages occur-

ring before menarche in the Andhs, Raj Gonds, and Pradhans may be due to the influence of local Hindu customs. It was less frequent in a primitive shifting agricultural group like the Kolams and in a nomadic group like the Mathuras who are relatively less influenced by local Hindu customs.
The mean marriage distance in all five groups was small, indicating restricted mobility and genetic migration (Table 3). It was highest in the Andhs, being 54 kilometers, and much lower in the Mathuras, Pradhans, Kolams and Raj Gonds, being 27 km., 26 km., 23 km., and 19km. respectively. However, the median values (Table 3) were different from the mean values in all five groups, indicating a non-Gaussian distribution. The higher mean marriage distance in the Andhs indicates that migration had occurred between the main parent group living in the Vidharbha area of Maharashtra and the smaller group in Utnoor taluka which had split from the main group (Fig. 1). The older

generation of Andhs who had migrated over large distances contributed to this higher average value, whereas the present younger generation preferred marriages at short distances (40 per cent of marriages occurring within the same village). The maximum genetic migration was up to a distance of 320 km. in this group. The other four groups had smaller average marriage distances, migration occurring at a maximum distance of between 100-150 km. The low mean marriage distance in the Mathuras indicated that this group, which was originally nomadic has now adopted a settled occupation which has isolated it from the rest of their people in North India.
The marriage distance distribution was calculated (Table 3) for all five groups and indicated that the Kolams and Pradhans are more mobile than are the Mathuras and Raj Gonds (Figs. 2 and 3). The probable reason is that the Kolams have a tendency to change their villages permanently (diffusional migra-

tion), being shifting agriculturists. The Pradhans being bards, visit various Raj Gond villages but return to their residence after their work is completed (gravitational migration). The frequency distributions of marriage distance in the Mathuras and Raj Gonds were skewed to the left, indicating less mobility due to a more settled agricultural occupation. The Andhs have a high percentage of marriages occurring

over 50 km. in distance (Fig. 4),the reason being that there is an influx ofAndhs into Utnoor taluka from the parent group in Southeastern Maharashtra.

lations belong. Karve, (1965) has found that a linguistic area is a culturally unified area and that a common language is a symbol of an underlying cultural synthesis which includes all aspects of social life. The Raj Gonds, Kolams, and Pradhans in northern Andhra Pradesh have a high inbreeding coefficient similar to that of rural populations of Andhra Pradesh. The Andhs, a Marathispeaking agricultural group which has recently migrated from Maharashtra show a lower inbreeding coefficient similar to that of the Maharashtra area. The Mathuras, a North Indian nomadic group, show a very low inbreeding coefficient, which is characteristic of North India where there is strict prohibition of marriages between two individuals related through a common male ancestor up to the seventh generation on the father's side and the fifth generation on the mother's side.
The marriage distance distribution indicates the influence of occupational

mobility as well as the migratory habits of these populations. The average marriage distance is low in all five populations, indicating restricted mobility due to the fact that their occupation is settled agriculture. However, out of these five groups, the Andhs show a greater range of marriage distance indicating that until a generation ago they were still migrating from Southeastern Maharashtra (Fig. 1). The Mathuras, originally a nomadic group of salt traders, have now settled down to agriculture as revealed by their marriage distribution which is skewed to the left, very similar to that of the Raj Gonds, a settled agricultural group.
