I t is generally agreed among students of these concerns are explored using interview social change that a major obstacle inhibit- data collected in a rural Colombian com-

ing social and economic improvement in the less developed nations of the world is the persistence of high fertility (Micklin, 1973; Revelle, 1971). Also clearly recognized is the importance of fertility norms and ideals for explaining variations in reproductive performance and family size (Davis and Blake, 1957; Freedman, 1963; Davis, 1967; Bogue, 1969, pp. 839-841). Nevertheless, conceptual, theoretical, and methodological problems still inhibit understanding of the mechanisms through which these norms and ideals are translated into actual family building activities (Häuser, 1967; Namboodiri, 1967; Hawthorn, 1968; Yaukey, 1969; Simmons, 1971, 1974; George, 1973). One such idea that has received relatively little attention is that of the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the limits and range of normatively evaluated reproductive performance, their relationship to processes of sociodemographic change, and their effect on family-size preference.

munity.
With few exceptions (Blake, 1966,1967; De Jong, 1968, p. 75-82; Rainwater, 1965, pp. 118-138) prior studies of family-size norms have focused on mean or median values rather than on proportional distributions over the range of reported preferences. Furthermore, even those investigators who have examined the empirical distribution of these ideals have grouped their observations into a few categories, the net result being that upper and lower limits are not identified, let alone systematically explored. Within any population there exist extreme values of family-size preferences that reflect the socially acceptable range of reproductive performance. For example, conceptions of families that are "large," "small," "too large," and "too small" can be translated into quantitative estimates of this normatively acceptable range (Westoff and Potvin, 1967, pp. 135-139). Persons exceeding these limits, in either direction, should be subject to social sanction. These

144-145, and Wagley, 1951). It should be evident that the greater the difference between upper and lower "ideal" limits within a population, the greater will be the variation in reproductive performance and attempts to control that performance. Moreover, the higher the upper limit, the greater the probability of high fertility. Significantly, these limits vary almost independently of the central tendency measures of family-size norms.
Analysis of the normative boundaries of acceptable family size may be carried further by considering their qualitative dimensions. For example, whatever the numerical value attached to the concept "large family," members of a population may evaluate it with positive or negative affect, or perhaps with indifference. And, whatever the evaluation expressed, it is important to know its existential basis. In other words, what is there about a "large family" that evokes a particular evaluation? Relatively few investigators have gone beyond the quantitative analysis of fertility ideals to assess these qualitative factors (but see Stycos, 1955; Rainwater, 1965; Simmons, 1971, 1974; and Hoffman and Hoffman, 1973). Additional questions emerge as one seeks to explain differences in these quantitative and qualitative dimensions of extreme family-size norms: How are they distributed among the various social groups and categories of a population? How are they influenced by processes of sociodemographic change? A number of studies have indicated that average familysize norms are, like levels of reproductive performance, lower among the "modernized" sectors of populations (Freedman, 1963; Mauldin, 1965), and one might expect extreme values to exhibit this same pattern. One heretofore unexplored aspect of the demographic transition is the question of whether there is a constriction of the socially acceptable range of family-size

preferences and/or a change of the existential bases for evaluating families of different sizes.
The issues outlined above should have direct bearing on fertility control programs. On the one hand, relevant data could be of utility for determining the potential market for family planning services and, on the other hand, they could provide a basis for structuring educational propaganda and presenting incentives for fertility limitation. Before it can be argued that "large" or "small" families are becoming more prevalent or that they are subjectively desirable, knowledge must be available as to how people define these categories and of the criteria by which they are evaluated. The study reported here is a step in this direction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All data analyzed in this paper were obtained from female residents of a rural town in the department of El Valle, Colombia. The town, a county seat with a population of about 2,500, is located on the edge of the fertile Cauca River Valley. Although almost all residents work either there or in the surrounding farm area, bus and auto travel to nearby cities is regular and easy. Most of the children living in the town were born there, but this is true for only about half the adults. A considerable turnover in population was experienced during the Violencia of the 195O's, although no great change in population size has occurred during the past thirty years, suggesting a continuing flow of out-migrants.
As part of a larger study dealing with natality-related health care, 91 recently delivered and currently pregnant women were interviewed during the summer of 1970. This represents almost all such women who were then residing in the community. Interviews were conducted in Spanish, in the homes of the respondents,

that might be found among other nonisolated rural women in Colombia. Although not directly comparable in all respects, a recently reported study (Simmons, 1974) provides some relevant data for a sample of 1,712 Colombian women. It will thus be possible to contrast our results with those from this more ambitious investigation and thus to determine the extent of agreement between the two.
Family-size boundaries are measured in terms of four questions designed to elicit quantitative estimates of "large" and "small" families. Each woman was asked to give the number of children she thought to constitute "a large family" and "a small family" and, in addition, the number of children felt to be "too many" and "too few." Interviewers were explicitly instructed

1 One reader of this paper commented that these two questions differ in that "brings problems" versus "is a blessing" is not a mutually exclusive pair of responses, while "is a good idea" versus "is not a good idea" is mutually exclusive. Whether or not such a difference would influence response patterns is a reasonable question, but one the authors cannot answer. However, we are not at all convinced that the first pair of responses is any less exclusive than the second. From a practical point of view, a condition that "brings problems" will not generally be viewed, at the same time, as a "blessing," and vice versa.
Moreover, there was a rationale underlying the differential wording of these two questions. We were trying to minimize the likelihood that a respondent's evaluation of "large family" would dictate her evaluation of "small family." We felt that if the two questions were worded exactly alike, e.g., "a good idea" versus "not a good idea," conflicting or ambiguous evaluations of these two family-size types would be unlikely to show up. In other words, the first response could potentially provide a cue to the second, assuming the respondent wished to appear consistent. We believe our decision to word the two questions differently reduced this possibility.

size preferences. Three are considered in this paper. First, the women were asked, "If you were to start your family all over again today, how many children would you have?" A second question was, "What do you think is the ideal number of children for a family in the same economic conditions as your present one?" Finally, respondents were asked, "If you were advising one of your own children about his own family, how many children would you like him/her to have?" Once again, interviewers were requested to allow respondents to answer freely without any assistance.
Two brief scales designed to measure traditional-modern value orientations, "integration with relatives" and "preference for urban life," are employed (Kahl, 1968, pp. 18-44). Three other variables are utilized as indicators of traditionalismmodernism as well. These include husband's education, respondent's education, and marital status, i.e., whether legally married or living in consensual union. I t is assumed that higher education indicates greater modernity (Fawcett and Bornstein, 1973, p. 125) and that legal marriage is more "modern" than consensual union in the cultural context in which observations were made.
RESULTS
FAMILY SIZE BOUNDARIES AND THEIR EVALUATION
Consider first the upper and lower boundaries used to circumscribe family-size norms. These boundaries are the mean number of children perceived by respondents to constitute a "large" family, a family with "too many" children, a "small" family, and a family with "too few" children. Table 1 presents these data according to a variety of respondent background characteristics. Results indicate, first, that the mean values for "large" families are con-

sistently greater than those for families with "too many" children, while "small" families are viewed as larger than those with "too few" children. Furthermore, older respondents indicate higher norms with regard to "small" families as well as those with "too many" children, and the mean values shown are smallest for women with lower parity (although it should be remembered that the majority have probably not completed their childbearing). Higher family income appears to be associated with lower values attributed to families with "too many" and "too few" children. Finally, respondents exhibiting greater traditionalism generally indicate higher values for all four categories of norms (Table 2).
Further variation is seen when respondents' patterns of evaluation for "large" and "small" families are examined. These women are almost equally divided regarding positive and negative evaluations of "large" families, with approximately 46 per cent saying that a "large" family is a blessing while SO per cent feel that it brings problems. A striking contrast is seen, however, when one considers evaluations of "small" families. Roughly three-quarters of these respondents think small families are a good idea while only IS per cent think they are not. Quite clearly then, according to these aggregate measures, the women surveyed do not hold fixed and consistent ideas regarding the evaluation of "large" and "small" families. Background characteristics have little influence on evaluations of "large" families, but a number of differences are related to indicators of traditionalism (Table 3). Traditional respondents are more likely to see "large" families as a blessing, while those who exhibit modern characteristics more often think that "small" families are a good idea.
The reason respondents give for evaluating "large" and "small" families as good and bad are of interest here (tables avail-

able from the authors). In many respects, the accounts provided by these women are similar to what Rainwater (1965, pp. 139-- 1S8) calls "rationales for family size." With respect to the desirability of "large" and "small" families, health-related factors are relatively unimportant. Nearly a third of the respondents for whom data are available (iV = 82) feel that provision for the welfare of children is more problematic in larger families, e.g., children receive inadequate care and guidance at home and too little formal education in "large" families. Economic factors such as inadequate resources for family support and inability to acquire savings are cited by about 45 per cent of the women as arguments against "large" families. Family-related factors are seen as positive attributes of "large" families with about 81 per cent of the respondents expressing a general liking for children or beliefs that family harmony is increased, that children may provide companionship and help for their parents, or that they may add to the prestige of the family name. It should be noted that only 19 per cent of these women feel that there is nothing good about "large" families and 24 per cent feel that there is nothing bad about them. In any case, it is clear that the great majority of women do weigh the relative merits of having "large" families though the evaluations are not greatly imbalanced.
With respect to the rationales given in evaluating "small" families, the general pattern of response shows that health factors are again seldom considered. Welfare of children and economic factors are seen overwhelmingly as positive attributes of the "small" family. The former category includes advantages in providing child care, education, ·and other socialization activities for children. Such considerations account for about 62 per cent of the positively perceived attributes of "small" families.

Economic advantages are cited only about half as frequently and consist of statements to the effect that family income will go further, savings are possible, inheritance is less problematic, and that the family's general economic welfare is better than would be the case with a "large" family. Family-related rationales are given as both positive and negative aspects of the "small" family, but the ratio is about four to one in favor of the latter. Positive aspects refer primarily to greater harmony and happiness, while negative factors suggest less harmony and happiness, lower family prestige, and greater loneliness for the parents. While only two respondents indicate that there is nothing good about "small" families, slightly more than four-fifths say that there is nothing bad about them. Clearly, in contrast to the balanced feelings these women apparently have toward "large" families, their evaluation of "small" families is overwhelmingly positive.
FAMILY-SIZE PREFERENCES
The data presented thus far suggest relatively flexible views regarding the acceptable range of reproductive behavior. Furthermore, as a group, these women appear to be somewhat ambivalent about the desirability of "large" families and generally in favor of "small" families even though they are rather consistent in their recognition of positive and negative aspects of these quite distinct (by their own definitions) family types. An interesting question may be raised as to where personal preferences fit in relation to these uncrystallized and sometimes inconsistent views regarding extreme values of family-size norms (cf. George, 1973, p. 363). Do they tend toward the "large" or "small" end of the continuum? Are values for family-size preferences affected by background characteristics and traditionalism in the same manner as are the more extreme limits considered earlier?

Micklin and Marnane

Social Biology

Several measures of family-size preferences are presented in Tables 4 and 5.Considering overall variations, it is evident that the ideal number of children respondents would advise their own children to have is consistently lower than their "subjective ideal" (i.e., the number of children the respondent would have if she could start over again) which is, in turn, consistently lower than the "objective ideal" (i.e., the number of children the respondent would suggest for. a family in similar economic circumstances).
Table 4 indicates that family-size

ideals and a smaller family advised for their children. An increasing number of pregnancies is related to higher objective ideals. Women in higher income families show lower subjective and objective ideals as well as preferences for fewer children for their own offspring. Finally, the number of children in the respondent's family of orientation is inversely related to subjective ideals and directly related to objective ideals and to ideals for their children.
Table S presents family-size preferences according to measures of traditionalism. The higher the respondent's level of edu-

siderably higher objective ideals. Further variations are evident according to value orientations, with those respondents who indicate higher preference for urban life showing lower objective ideals and lower ideals for their children. Women scoring lower on integration with relatives have slightly higher objective ideals and higher ideals for their children.
It is evident that these respondents' family-size preferences approximate much more closely their concept of "small" than of "large" families. In fact, though their mean objective ideal exceeds by about half a child the norm for a "small" family, their mean subjective ideal is about two-tenths of a child less than this number, and the mean ideal they would advise for their children is fully half a child less. In no case, however, are these preferences less than the lower limit defined as "too few." It is also apparent that background factors and measures of traditionalism are

frequently, though not always consistently, related to these norms.
EVALUATIONS, BOUNDARIES, AND PREFERENCES
Earlier in this discussion it was demonstrated that respondents varied somewhat in their evaluation of "large" and "small" families. It is reasonable to ask whether these global judgments regarding extremes in family-size norms exert an influence on the associated numerical values as well as the intermediate family-size preferences (cf. Simmons, 1971). Evidence regarding this question is presented in Tables 6 and 7. Overall evaluations of "large" and "small" families affect the numerical limits attributed to each only with respect to these extremes (Table 6). It is apparent that mean values for both indicators of "small" families are quite close regardless of overall evaluations of either "large" or "small" families. On the other hand, the lowest value for number of children that

constitutes "too many" is obtained from respondents who say "large" families "bring problems," -while the highest values are evident for those women who say "large" families are "a blessing" and "small" families are "a bad thing." Similarly, the highest mean value attributed to "large" families is given by respondents who say "small" families are "a bad thing," although, perhaps unexpectedly, the lowest value for "large" families is indicated by those women who say "large" families are "a blessing." Once again, greater inconsistencies are encountered with respect to ideas regarding the upper limits of familysize norms.
In Table 7 the influence of family-size evaluations on family-size preferences is considered. Not only do overall evaluations make a difference, but these differences are consistently as expected. That is to say, those women who negatively evaluate "small" families have the highest mean values on all three preference measures. The next highest values observed appear in the case of those respondents who feel that

"large" families are "a blessing." Values for those who feel "large" families are problematic and that "small" families are "a good thing" are smallest, and differences between the two are minimal. Thus, it is evident that with respect to family-size preferences, respondents' orientations toward "large" and "small" families, especially the latter, are highly consequential for their personal ideals and the counsel they would provide their children as well.
DISCUSSION
In this section we discuss our overall findings and, where possible, contrast them with the Colombian data presented by Simmons (1974). A clear pattern emerges from data reflecting the rank order of mean values of family-type categories. The number of children in a "large" family is highest, followed by number of children considered "too many," number of children in a "small" family, and number of children considered "too few," in that order. It is encouraging to observe that our respon-

tive ideal, with the ideal for one's own children having the lowest value. Whereas definitional criteria, overall, show an inconclusive pattern, it is evident that mean values for number of children that are "too many" and number of children in a "small" family are depressed in the cases where "large" families are viewed negatively and "small" families are viewed positively. In accord with this pattern, it was determined that the ideals themselves are lower for those who view "large" families negatively and "small" families positively in all measured instances. This finding clearly implies that attitudes toward variable levels of family size affect the quantitative criteria by which they are defined as the projected ideal reproductive behavior. Confirming evidence is once again provided by Simmons (1974, p. 136, Table 7).
With respect to traditional-modern value orientations, definitional means are depressed among the more modern categories of respondents in almost all instances. Moreover, "modern" women are more likely to view "large" families negatively and "small" families positively than are their more traditional counterparts. When considering links between bases for qualitative evaluation of "large" families, the traditional-modern differences are somewhat mixed, although there is a tendency for more modern persons to mention welfare of children and economic reasons more frequently and family reasons less frequently. Analysis of judgments regarding the advantages and disadvantages of "small" families does not permit clear differentiation between traditional and modern groups.
Regarding both subjective and objective family-size ideals, it is apparent that more modern women tend to exhibit lower mean values than do traditional women, while the pattern is mixed with respect to the number of offspring they would advise for their

own children. It is interesting that examination of standard deviations indicates that the more modern respondents, those with lower family-size ideals, and those with lower quantitative criteria for various classes of families show less variation about the mean. Furthermore, it can be observed that ranges between categories of family size and categories of ideals tend to be more constricted for the moderns as well. This suggests that modern persons may better communicate their norms than traditional persons, which is perhaps to be expected where fatalistic acceptance of norms and "the lightness of what is" are associated with traditional orientations toward patterns of social conduct.
Results regarding the positive and negative aspects of "large" and "small" families are in agreement with Stycos' Puerto Rican data (1955, pp. 158-181), as well as the more extensive information presented by Simmons (1974). While economic considerations in particular suggest the undesirability of "large" families, contradictory sentiments, focusing on contributions children make to family cohesion and family security, work in the opposite direction. The simultaneous existence of these conflicting evaluations probably works against the crystallization of an effective universalistic smaller family norm. The ambiguity in evaluations, although weighted in favor of "small" families, may well result from conflicting cultural influences. On the one hand, there is the traditional norm associated with rural life and Catholicism that emphasizes the value of "large" families while, on the other hand, women are influenced by a shared awareness of the economic and family responsibility difficulties involved in raising numerous children. These women are probably much like their poor and lower-middle-class counterparts in the United States who reflect the idea that numerous children are desirable, but

one should not have more children than the family can support (Rainwater, 1965, p. ISO).
IMPLICATIONS
Stycos (1971, p. 8) has argued that "there is little doubt that there is at least a latent preference for a moderate size family rather than a small one [in Latin America]." These rural Colombian women show family-size preferences more closely approximating "small" families as defined by their own normative criteria. This suggests that, in a normative sense, "small" families are considered desirable; but the definition of "small," from their point of view, is still higher than demographers and family planners would view as moderate size.
An important implication of this finding for fertility control programs is that planners who aim at bringing about a depression of fertility rates must emphasize the value of families of a specific size rather than of the "small" family as a generalized concept. If parents and potential parents in their observations and conversations with others determine that the implicit norm for "small" families is three or four or five children, then the motivation for limiting family size early in their reproductive life cycle is not going to be great. And if families do not seriously consider the utilization of reliable contraceptive methods until their reproductive performance far exceeds replacement, the goal of family planning programs, that is, reduction of population growth, becomes largely irrelevant to their means. If, in the face of increased longevity, the ideals of family size are not quantitatively decreased, then the planning of births by families can only lead to continued high rates of population growth.
I t would appear from the data presented here that women, as they become more "modernized," do tend to see greater

advantages in smaller families. Still, their concept of what quantitatively defines a "small" family is far greater than required for replacement. Consequently, even if the cultural norm favors "small" families and family planning by couples is absolutely effective, the net result could be at best a small decline in overall rates of population growth. It is for such reasons that Davis (1967) argues that family planning programs as they currently exist are largely ineffective in achieving the goals of fertility control.
It has been demonstrated in numerous KAP studies that there is a general desire to limit family size in almost all areas of the world, leading some optimists to conclude that norms have emerged which favor the use of effective contraceptive techniques in family planning (see Bogue, 1967). But family planning programs aimed at providing the assurance that couples will have "no more children than they want" or even "small" families, as observed in the present research, are hopelessly inadequate to the task of reducing growth rates. Policy must explicitly emphasize reducing quantitative norms to levels that are considerably lower than those which now obtain. Vagueness in population policy, as in all such statements, tends to subvert the goals of planning.
SUMMARY
Quantitative and qualitative dimensions of family-size norms have been examined for a nearly complete enumeration of currently pregnant and recently delivered women residing in a rural Colombian town (N = 9l). Attention is focused on perceived numerical boundaries for families that are "large," "small," "too large," and "too small" as well as on evaluations of these normatively defined family units, and on family-size preferences. Variations are assessed in terms of selected respondent

background characteristics and measures of traditional-modern value orientations.
Results indicate that quantitative norms are highest for "large" families, followed by the norms for families with "too many" children, those that are "small," and those with "too few" children, respectively. Smaller norms are indicated by younger women who have had fewer pregnancies, are of lower economic status, come from larger families of orientation, and hold more modem values.
While "large" families are equally evaluated as a blessing and as problematic, "small" families are given positive evaluations by over three-quarters of the women interviewed. The quality of interpersonal relationships is seen as a positive aspect of "large" families and a negative aspect of "small" families, whereas economic and child welfare factors are viewed as negative aspects of "large" families and positive aspects of smaller ones.
Family-size preferences are lowest when advice for respondents' children is considered, higher when the possibility of beginning one's ownfamily again is contemplated, and highest when considering economic circumstances, and preferences are generally related to respondent characteristics in the same direction as were norms for familysize boundaries. Furthermore, positive eval-

uations of "large" families and negative
evaluations of "small" families are con-
sistently associated with larger boundary
estimates and family-size preferences.
Discussion concentrates on the ambigu-
ities evident in these estimates and evalu-
ations of family-size norms and their
implications for family planning policy.
Many of the findings reported here are
highly consistent with comparable data
pertaining to a much larger sample of rural
Colombian women (Simmons, 1974), thus
providing independent confirmation for
these data.
