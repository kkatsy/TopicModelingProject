A Regression Approach to the Projection of U.S. Fertility Based on Past Fertility Data

ABSTRACT: The method of fertility projection used by the U.S. Bureau of the Census involves assumptions about the ultimate cohort total fertility rate and the ultimate cohort mean age at childbearing based on recent levels of fertility and women's birth expectations. This paper provides an outline of a general regression approach to fertility projection based on past data which would generate these two ultimate cohort characteristics. The technique is illustrated by using the U.S. single-year age-specific fertility rates up to 1986 for total women and projecting them indefinitely into the future until they become stable for both calendar years and cohorts.

For the past twenty-five years, the basic steps involved in the projection of fertility by the U.S. Bureau of the Census have been as follows: (1) assume an ultimate cohort total fertility rate consistent with recent levels of fertility, women's expectations of future births, and social and economic trends that affect fertility; (2) assume an ultimate cohort mean age at childbearing consistent with the assumption in Step 1; (3) generate a set of ultimate age-specific fertility rates by studying the past shapes of the cohort fertility schedules which is consistent with assumptions in Steps 1 and 2; and, finally, (4) obtain the age-specific fertility rates between the base year and the year when they are assumed to have reached stability by interpolation and other means to make sure that the generated fertility schedules maintain unimodal shapes and converge smoothly to the ultimate values for both periods and cohorts.

In its recent published report on projection, the Census Bureau assumed ultimate cohort total fertility rates of 1.5, 1.8, and 2.2 per woman for the low, middle, and high series, respectively, and an ultimate cohort mean age at childbearing of 26.92 for all three series (Bureau of the Census, 1989, p. 23). Although the total fertility rate rose to as high as 3.7 in 1957, it has been under two children since 1972. Therefore, any value of ultimate fertility outside the range of 1.7 to 2.1 would hardly be acceptable to demographers at the present time. The assumption of an ultimate cohort mean age at childbearing consistent with the ultimate cohort total fertility rate has never been easy for the Census Bureau because of an apparently unclear relationship between these two variables. Over time, they are sometimes positively (e.g., 1957-1964,1982-1990) and sometimes negatively (e.g., 1964-1982) correlated (compare the dashed curves

tility rates for successive years, and hence the ultimate total fertility and the ultimate mean age, are obtained from the estimated regression equations by repeated applications of them with new sets of values for the independent variables as the projection proceeds. The technique is illustrated by using the U.S. single-year age-specific fertility rates up to 1986 for total women and projecting them indefinitely into the future until they become stable for both calendar years and cohorts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The method of projection proposed in this paper is a multiple linear regression technique, where the fertility rate in an age is the dependent variable, and the independent variables are one or more variables created from the past age-specific fertility rates.
For the purpose of illustration, we choose three independent variables which can.represent, in a very crude sense, the age, period, and cohort effects in fertility (Hobcraft et al., 1982). Each of the 36 equations for the 36 ages 14,15,. . . , 49 has the general form

Xi=A+ B2X2

, (1)

where the dependent variable Xi is the fertility rate at age a in year t, and the independent variables X2, X3, and X4 are, respectively, the total fertility rate in year t--1 (period effect), the cumulative fertility of the cohort in the preceding ten years (cohort effect), and the sum of six fertility rates, viz., those at ages a -- I, a, and a + 1 in years t--1 and t -- 2 (age effect).
While the period effect X2 is an objectively defined variable, subjective elements are involved in the definitions of X2 and Xt. The fertility of a woman at

age 32, for example, is expected to depend more on her cumulative fertility in the preceding few years rather than on her fertility at age 31 or on her life-time fertility up to age 31. However, there is no obvious reason why this cumulation should be done over the preceding ten years (and not, say, over the preceding nine or eleven years). This problem in the definition of the cohort effect X3 may be resolved easily by computing the actual correlation coefficients between Xi and X3 (eliminating the effects of X2 and X^ corresponding to various possible cumulation periods. Again, the fertility rate at the same age ain the preceding year t--1 may be a good choice for the age effect Xt, on theoretical grounds. However, the error in this individual rate relative to the rates at other ages around it and at other years preceding it calls for the use of several rates centered at age a in the definition of Xi. The use of six rates that we have chosen is just one such possibility. We should emphasize that the names given to the effects of the variables X2, X3, and Xi as period, cohort, and age effects may not be purely scientific; but no matter how we describe them, the real test for the variables lies in how acceptable they are in terms of the correlations and the goodness of fit of the regression equations.
The single-year central birth rates in ages 14 through 49 for all women from 1917 through 1986 are available from Heuser (1976) and from the National Center for Health Statistics (published and unpublished). The period total fertility ratesfluctuatedrelatively smoothly over time starting from the late 1940's (Figure 1). We, therefore, discarded the data for the earlier years. In order to test the sensitivity of the method to the beginning and end of the years of data used, we obtained nine sets of projec-

of the regression equations are satisfactory and that each of the independent variables contributes significantly to these fittings.
A prudent choice of the variablesin the multiple regressions should lead to convergence of the age-specific fertility rates to some stable values, although this cannot be proved mathematically. Again, ifwe have a reasonable number

in mind that we would like to see as the ultimate total fertility rate, that number can be generated, at least approximately, by varying the number ofyears of data asour input. This opens up the possibility of providing three sets of projections (low, middle, and high), as does the Census Bureau, byusing past data for three different lengths ofthe period without changing the basic method.
