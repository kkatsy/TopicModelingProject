The study of human fertility has long been an area of critical interest to social and biological scientists. Myriad social and biological variables have been investigated in order to determine the factors that influence the wide variation in fertility rates in various populations at different points in time. An independent variable that has generated considerable interest among researchers has been the impact of the size of one's parents' family (the family of orientation) upon the size of one's own family (family of procreation).
Pearl (1939) evaluated a number of research attempts to biometrically determine the impact of genetic inheritance upon human fertility. He ranked various studies on the strength of the correlations between the size of the family of orientation and the size of families of procreation. The strength of the correlation coefficients range from the Pearson et al. study (1899) in which an r of 0.213 was obtained to a --0.037 reported by Fetscher (1933). Pearson et al. reported data on the correlations of the family size of both the father and the mother while the other studies confined themselves to the family size of one parent only. A recent replication of Pearson's classic study by Williams and Wil-

liams (1974) virtually substantiated the correlations obtained by Pearson.
Berent (1953) points out that Pearson et al. (1899) investigated intergenerational fertility from a hereditary standpoint, assuming that man inherits the capacity to reproduce. The Pearson study somewhat obscured the important distinction between fertility (the actual rate of reproduction) and fecundity (the biological capacity to reproduce). This same obfuscated perspective was shared by Huestis and Maxwell (1932) who looked at the inherited desire to have children, all but ignoring fluctuations in fecundity or the biological capacity to reproduce. Their rationale was that with the increasing popularity and effectiveness of birth control techniques, parents could then choose the size family they desired.
Berent (1953), on the other hand, separated birth "controllers" from "non-controllers" and correlated the results of each group with the size of their respective families of orientation. In both cases, he found the patterns of procreation to be similar to the patterns of the family of orientation. He concluded that both the biological ability to have children as well as "family building habits" are inherited.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

we proposed that, given a random and equally fecund population, fertility rates would largely be the result of socialization or training within the parental household. Freedman (1961) contends that the ques-

problem in most cases. These norms are likely to prescribe a range of acceptable or desirable numbers of children, and this range is then amplified through the interpretation and transmission of such norms from parents to children.
Rainwater (1960, p. 55) has proposed:

These data are contained in 800,000 rolls or 80 million feet of microfilm and 100,000 books. In addition, the library serves as a repository for individual pedigrees of Mormons and

to find. It was discovered that a few families had completed only three generations prior to 1925. This partially accounts for the slight incongruence in the total number in the following statistical tables.
I t proved to be a formidable task to trace all of the children within each respective family of orientation across four successive generations. Therefore, we decided to trace each family line through the eldest and the youngest children who had been married. This procedure maximized the within-group variance in each family, thus eliciting rather conservative correlations. We assumed that siblings who were in contingent birth order would have the most similar fertility patterns. Thus, we intentionally selected the oldest and youngest children in order to insure that, if indeed strong positive correlations in intergenerational fertility did occur, this would not be the result of selecting only those children whose fertility, for various reasons, may most closely approximate that of their parents or siblings. In order to control for the influence of multiple marriages, persons married more than once during their childbearing years were excluded from the study.
The size of the family of orientation for both the husband and the wife was obtained whenever possible. The data were coded from 1,070 family group sheets consisting of 402 families in the first generation (wife born between 1825 and 1850), 329 second-generation families, 248 thirdgeneration families, and 89 families from the fourth generation. The third and fourth generations were predominantly Mormons, including recent converts, living within the western United States. The two earlier generations, however, consisted of many non-Mormons since the Church was not founded until 1830, and most of those in the first generation had not yet been converted. The ancestry of those included

in the sample was predominantly AngloSaxon, Northern European, and Scandinavian in origin. Each successive generation was determined by the lines of lineal descent from the initial families referred to as the first generation.
I t was hypothesized that a positive correlation would be found between family sizes in successive generations and that the magnitude of this correlation would decrease as the families approached the present.
RESULTS
We first examined the mean number of

children born to couples married during successive decades beginning with 1840. These data reveal that family size remained fairly stable between 1860 and 1900 and then dropped rapidly, reaching its lowest point for couples married during the 1920's. The mean number of children declined from a high of 8.87 for couples married between 1851 and 1860 to a low of 3.61 for those married between 1921 and 1930 (Table 1). This finding is consistent with Riser's (1970) observation that, with the exception of the 1860 census, there was a steady decline in fertility within the United States from 1800 to

1936. As expected, the standard deviation also decreased considerably from a high of 7.66 between 1851 and 1860 to a lowof 1.69 during the Depression.
When the families are grouped by generation, the decline in family size is quite apparent, with average decreases of 0.94 children between the first and second generations, 2.46 between the second and third generations, and 0.76 between the third and fourth generations (Table 2).

Also apparent was the decrease in the variance within generations. The standard deviation for the first generation was S.49; it declined to 2.31 within the fourth generation (Table 2). This reduction in variance is, of course, at least in part a function of the diminution of family size itself. Nevertheless, there is a definite trend in the recent generation toward a more uniform family size.
The correlation coefficients between the size of each parent's family of orientation and the size of their family of procreation by marriage cohort revealed a great deal of fluctuation with regard to which marital partner exerts the stronger influence upon fertility. Huestis and Maxwell (1932) and Berent (1953) maintained that the mother's family accounted for more of the variation in the family of procreation than did the father's family.
In a more recent analysis of intergenerational fertility in Japan, Imaizumi et al. (1970) found stronger mother-offspring correlations in four out of the five ten-year

cohorts investigated. Correlations ranged from 0.272 for mothers and their offspring to a low of --0.002 for fathers and their offspring.
However, an analysis of the partial correlations for cohorts within our data (Table 3) shows that in five out of nine cohorts there was a higher correlation between the father's family of orientation and procreation. These findings substantiate the observation of Duncan et al. (196S) that the wife's family does not exert a substantially stronger, relationship to fertility than does the husband's family of orientation.
Correlation coefficients between the size of the respective families of orientation of the father and of the mother with the size of their own respective family of procreation are also somewhat enigmatic (Table 4). The correlation between the family size of the first and second generations is 0.21 for the fathers and 0.23 for mothers. Family size during those early years remained fairly stable, and the differences between the mean family size for those two generations is slightly less than one (Table 2).
When the correlations between the second and third generations are examined, it is apparent that the relative influence of the size of the father's family of orientation has decreased (0.17) while the mother's influence has risen slightly (0.24). This change is borne out by a comparison of differences between the means for the two generations. Although there was a sharp drop in the number of the children born in the third generation, the strength of the positive correlation between the size of families of orientation and procreation remained relatively strong. This finding would indicate a sustained tendency for those from large families to still bear large families of procreation even though these families were not as large as those of their

respective parents. The same general trend would also hold true for those from small families who themselves bore small families.
Between the third and fourth generations, the mean number of children declined only 0.76 (Table 2), but the correlation coefficients indicate an inverse relationship between the size of the family of orientation and the family of procreation (--0.03 for fathers and --0.1S for mothers). A partial correlation between the mother's family of orientation and her

own family of procreation, controlling for father's family size, is even larger (--0.217), indicating a definite shift toward the tendency for those from large families to bear small families and vice versa.
DISCUSSION
It is apparent from the results of this study, and those cited previously, that the size of the family of orientation has a relatively small influence upon the size of the family of procreation. Since the
