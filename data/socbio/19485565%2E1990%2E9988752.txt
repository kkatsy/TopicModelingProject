ABSTRACT:This study investigated assortative mating in a series of monozygotic twins in terms of anthropométrie variables. Initially the twins were analyzed independent of each other, and the results showed fairly clear homogamy among female MZ twins and their spouses, after correcting for age. Further, when stature was partialled out, several anthropometric measures remained significantly correlated. The results for male MZ twins and their spouses were not nearly so clear-cut. A second analysis treated the co-twins together, and once again, the female MZ sets tended to show assortative mate choice for stature while the male MZ twins/spouses were not significantly correlated. A follow-up analysis investigated whether husbands of the female twins were correlated to each other, and negative results were found for all of the 46 anthropometric variables. An apparent contradiction was resolved in the case of stature by regressing spouse stature against that of the co-twins. It was found that although each of the twins was assortatively mating, one member of the twin set consistently married a taller husband, but the difference was not constant. This had the effect of producing divergent regression lines.

tion, (c) attrition from the sample through divorce of those who were least similar, and (d) a confounding with agerelated variables, that is, a tendency for aging humans in general to share certain changes in common, such as weight gain or stature reduction. Clearly, these factors must be reckoned with before any theory of assortative mating can be properly tested.
In this paper we have sought to determine the degree to which identical twins and their prospective spouses practiced assortative marriage. Also, we were interested in the question of whether the spouses of each twin pair closely resembled one another. The spouses might be expected to be quite similar if, (a) the twins'were controlling the mate selection process, and (b) the twins made similar choices of mates, in line with their other shared behaviors and common lifestyles. The latter of these two considerations would more likely apply to the female MZ twins than to the male twins, based on informal discussions we had with the twins concerning their patterns of preferences and decision making.

The measurements were taken between 1974 and 1976 by a single anthropometrist; namely, Dona Thompson-Jacob. She was trained by one of us (PLJ), and her techniques followed those of Hertzberg et al. (1963) and Weiner and Lourie (1969). The primary method of analysis was linear correlation, and all data were processed on a CDC 855computer using the SPSS packaged programs.
The families generally resided in the Indianapolis area, although some lived in surrounding communities and a few came from bordering states, most often Illinois. Regarding racial background, all of the twin families indicated only Caucasian ancestry with these exceptions. Two of the female twin pairs reported having American Indian grandparents while one male twin pair had a Mexican ancestor in an unknown past generation. In these cases of mixed ancestry as well as in the great majority of the remaining twin families, northern European countries (particularly Germany, England, and Ireland) were reported to be the prevalent sources of ancestors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

RESULTS

This study was part of a long-term examination of adult monozygotic twins, their husbands or wives, and their children undertaken by the Medical Genetics Department, Indiana University Medical School, Indianapolis. Zygosity of the twins was determined by the similarity method and utilized more than 20 heritable blood and salivary markers (Nance et al., 1974). Each of the sets of twins were reared together.
Our data consist of 46 anthropométrie variables measured on 16 male and 32 female twin pairs and their spouses.

Table 1 presents data on assortative mating for the Indianapolis twin panel for three variables: age, stature, and weight. Comparative studies on assortative mating are also included. For this part of the analysis, co-twins were treated independent of one another, but because of missing data the sample sizes are reduced to 25 males and 52 females rather than twice the number of twin pairs reported above. Table 1 indicates that the Indianapolis twin/spouse sets are clearly mating assortatively for age. Indeed, for the female twins and their

ficantly correlated with stature and hence could be coincidental with respect to assortative mating. That is, they might not be directly involved in mate selection but are significant only because of their strong association with stature.
Conversely, since more than strictly linear measurements are involved, it is possible that assortative mating was based on a general physical phenotype. Indeed, that is what the stature controlled variables in the main portion of Table 2 seem to suggest. Most of these are breadth dimensions of the extremities and facial area, and therefore they are not expected to co-vary with stature. Of interest, all of these measures except ear breadth remain significantly correlated after also correcting for body weight. It would appear that these female twins and their spouses are assortatively mating for selected physical characteristics or appearances in addition to general body size.
Up to now we have analyzed the twins independently. Our next question considered whether both members of the twin pair were participating in assortative mating along a similar direction and to a similar degree. To examine this we first needed a way to assign the twin members to separate groups. We opted to use birth order on the basis of an earlier study (Jamison et al., 1989) that showed the first-born of the twinpair generally to be a larger adult than the second-born co-twin. By grouping on the basis of birth order, we would help to preserve any body size differences that might enter into the assortative mating process. Results of this analysis can be seen in Table 3.
Again referring to the lower half of this table, we see that male-twin/spouse correlations for stature were not signi-

ficant. However, the female-twin/ spouse correlations were significant in the first-born-twin/spouse group and closely approached statistical significance in the second-born group. Thus, we can say that assortative mating for stature seems to follow similar lines for both members of the female twin pairs.
The next obvious question to ask is whether mates of co-twins closely resemble one another. We looked at this matter only in the female twins and their spouses; hence, we were asking whether the husbands of co-twins were phenotypically similar. Our results showed no significant correlations between the husbands for any of the 46 anthropométrie variables. This result was rather puzzling, particularly in light of ourfinding that co-twins were each assortatively mating for stature; yet the stature correlation between their husbands was only r= -0.013 P = 0.96, ,/V = 22).
An explanation for this apparent contradiction might be found when looking more closely at the relationship between the husband's heights. Figure 1 shows the regression of spouse stature on twin stature analyzed by first- and secondborn twin groups. As can be seen, there is indeed an assortative distribution whereby stature increase in the twins corresponds to stature increase in their

but in the case of the Ann Arbor study (Spuhler, 1968) there was limited support for the idea that assortative mating and fertility are linked. Indeed, Lewontin, et al. (1968) are of the opinion that there is very little selection in the form of differential fertility operating at the present time on humans. Hence, assortative mating in the absence of a measurable fertility differential, if intense enough and of long enough duration, could lead to a redistribution of genes toward homozygous genotypes, as well as an increase in population variance, but would not likely alter gene frequencies.
Finally, in this paper we have not ascribed directionality to the assortative mating process. In other words, we assumed that mate selection is a mutual decision among prospective partners. On the other hand, identical twins could

well depart from this expectation, and as our results suggest, female MZ twins may in fact be controlling the decision. No less an authority than Darwin concluded that, "antipathies and preferences" in mate choice are more commonly found in the female than in the male (Darwin, 1981, p. 273). Since the male twins did not show any assortative mating in anthropometries, it can be asked whether this finding should be considered an expression of their independence in actions and therefore attributable to modes of behavior not explored in this study. Accordingly, future research involving mate choice and anthropometry might do well to integrate a behavioral component into the design in order to assess directly the decisionmaking process which led to the measured phenotypic correspondence, or lack thereof, between spouses.
