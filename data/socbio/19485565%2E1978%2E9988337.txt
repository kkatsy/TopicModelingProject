ABSTRACT: This study concerns the fertility of Sherpa and Tibetan women living at altitudes over 3,400 meters in Nepal. The average completed fertility (4.77 live births) and estimated crude birth rate (31 to 33 per 1,000) are low relative to low altitude peasant populations as well as to high altitude Andean peasants. Environmental phenomena (hypoxia, iodine deficiency) may be associated with retarded menarchial age and high infant mortality; but the major factors causing the low fertility appear to be cultural rather than environmental. Traditional ceremonial requirements delay the age at marriage until the mid or late twenties. Religious practices promote male and female celibacy. Migrant females and women married to migrant males report reduced fertility, probably because of poor nutrition and health care. Nonmigrant women living in villages that participate extensively in the cash economy have greater access to the growing market economy, health care, and education and report higher numbers of live births and fewer child deaths.

The inhabitants of the Dudh Kosi River Valley in northeastern Nepal, are generally referred to as Sherpas. The traditional homeland of the Sherpas can be divided into three areas: Solu, Pharak, and Khumbu (von Furer-Haimemdorf, 1964). Figure 1shows the altitude and associated vegetation types of these areas. Most of the Khumbu population is concentrated in six major villages, all located above 3,400 meters and below the winter snow line (4,000 meters). The population of these villages ranges between 250 and 800 inhabitants. Temporary settlements exist between 4,000 and 4,800 meters, but they are used only during the summer for agriculture and pasturage. Two large monasteries are located near the major villages, and a number of isolated homesteads are scattered throughout the area.
In this region of severe climatic conditions and poor vegetation, the Sherpas

have traditionally depended upon a mixed herding and agricultural base, with trading activity carried out by a small percentage of the population. There is only one agricultural season, from early May to late August. Potatoes, along with some buckwheat and vegetables, are grown during this time. Although the potato is the dietary staple of the Sherpas, considerable time and effort are expended on the care of yaks and crossbred stock. They provide some meat and dairy products, but are primarily thought of as prestige items.
Although most of the Khumbu's inhabitants share the same culture, differences in socioeconomic status exist within villages, and differences in acculturation exist between villages. These differences make it possible to examine whether the extreme environment or intragroup cultural variation more significantly affects Khumbu demographic structure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Two teams independently collected demographic data during 1970 and1971. The first survey was undertaken bytwo New Zealand physicians working at a hospital in one village. Both physicians had resided in the area for about six months before the survey was initiated and were well known. With twoassistants trusted by local inhabitants, they conducted a house-to-house survey in the fall of 1970.An effort was made to contact and enumerate all inhabitants of the Khumbu. A preliminary report of this survey has been published elsewhere (Lang and Lang, 1971). A second team, together with different assistants, resurveyed two-thirds of one village and about one-fourth of the other villages in the winter and spring of 1971.
In both surveys, respondents were asked to relate information on age, village of birth, village of spouse's birth, occupation, and number of marriages. Females

were asked to relate ageat menarche, age at first pregnancy, number of pregnancies, number of live births, number of miscarriages and stillbirths, number of neonatal, infant, and child deaths and the number, age, and sexof living children. Theresurvey also gathered data on clan affiliation, geneology, and age at marriage. An attempt wasalso made to expand mortality information beyond the childhood years. However, a disinclination to relate the names of dead adults prevented these data from being systematically gathered.
The determination of age was often problematical, both because age categories are defined in a non-Western manner and because of the low literacy level. However, formal Western-style education in local schools enabled most individuals under the ageof 30to calculate their ages in terms of a Western calendar with reasonable accuracy (i.e., within one or two years). Theages of older individuals were determined by recall of important events

to migrant men and unmarried women who are not living in the village of their birth.
In some cases, a man may move to another village to marry a woman who has no brothers and who consequently will inherit her father's property. Such marriages are relatively rare, however. More commonly, men (sometimes with their wives) move into a village where no family connections exist. Under these circumstances, access to land, animals, and material items is restricted to what migrants can afford to purchase. Often, this is very little.
Most of the Khumbu's residents were born in the area and reside in the village of their birth or one nearby. About 10 per cent, however, were born in Tibet, and another 2-3 per cent were born in other regions of Nepal. Most Tibetan residents immigrated to the Khumbu in 1959 and were among over 6,000 migrants camping in the area at that time (von Furer-Haimendorf, 1964). In 1970 and 1971, only 287 Tibetans remained. They comprise

the bulk of Socioeconomic Category 2. Of the unmarried women in this category, almost 60 per cent are Tibetans. Of the married women in this category, most of whom are Tibetan themselves, 65 per cent have Tibetan spouses and another 8 per cent are married to men born in another part of Nepal, mostly the Solu or Pharak areas. Most Tibetans, regardless of their sex, occupy low positions in the Khumbu social hierarchy and maintain cultural patterns that are often distinguishable from those of larger Sherpa society. Tibetans tend to participate in the cash economy, rather than in the traditional Sherpa agrarian pursuits, and therefore reside primarily in acculturated villages. Many Tibetans in the acculturated villages are expedition guides or work at crafts they sell locally. A large number of Tibetans are also associated in some manner with local village Gompas (Buddhist temples).
Because the great majority of migrant males possess little property and because Tibetan migrants of both sexes are subject to social discrimination, women in Socio-

The average age at menarche does not differ significantly between women in the three age groups. The average age at first pregnancy reported by women in the two oldest groups is similar, but it declines somewhat among the youngest women, The average number of live births and the average number of surviving children increases with the age of the mother.

The percentage of infant deaths added to the percentage of child deaths and to the percentage of surviving children may not total 100 per cent because of deaths in adolescence and early adulthood. This is mainly true for women in the oldest age group, all of whose 333 surviving children are over age 12 (average age, 21.9 years). The children of women in the two youngest age groups are mostly under age 12. For this reason, the responses of women age SO and older probably provide a more accurate understanding of survivorship through childhood.

dren arranged by age of mother, socioeconomic category, and residence. Differences are analyzed by means of a chisquare test. In all three age groups, no statistically significant residence or socioeconomic related differences exist in the percentage of infant deaths. In the two older age groups, the percentage of child deaths reported by women from unacculturated villages is nearly twice as high as that reported by women from acculturated villages. Differences are statistically significant at the 0.05 level of probability. Among children of women aged 29 and under, infant and child deaths are more common in Socioeconomic Category 1. However, differences between the two socioeconomic categories are not statistically significant.
Among women in the two older age groups, a slightly higher percentage of surviving children is reported in acculturated villages. However, differences are not statistically significant. Among women in the youngest age group, survivorship is slightly higher among children of women in Socioeconomic Category 2. However, here too, the differences are not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
FERTILITY
The fertility of Sherpa women is somewhat low compared with peasant populations at low altitude (Henry, 1961; Weiner, 1964) as well as with other highaltitude groups (Hoff and Abelson, 1976). The average completed fertility among women over SO is fewer than five live births, and the estimated crude birth rate (31 to 33 per 1,000) is considerably below that reported at high altitudes in South America (between 46 and 56 per 1,000) by Baker and Dutt (1972).
One contributory factor may be the late onset of menarche. The average age at menarche reported for the Sherpa, both

here and by Pawson (1976), is considerably later than that of high-altitude Andean women (Cruz-Coke et al., 1966). Recall problems may exist, and the frequency of women reporting fifteen and twenty years as their age at menarche is quite high. However, the existence of late menarchial age is supported by responses of younger women, who are more likely to remember the occurrence of menarche accurately, as well as by the results of probit and radiographie analyses carried out in an independent sample (Pawson, 1976).
The cause of this extremely late menarchial age is presently unclear. The data presented here suggest that it is unaffected by the economic, nutritional, or health care differences associated with residence or socioeconomic category. Since these factors are associated with variable menarche at low altitude (Petersen, 1975), their lack of effect at high altitude may suggest the action of a more universal phenomenon. Noting that the menarchial age of low altitude Tibetans is equally late, Pawson (1976) posits a genetic basis. Ibbertson et al. (1971) have demonstrated that goiter and cretinism are endemic among the Sherpas and that both are associated with hypothyroidism. These conditions are known to retard sexual maturation (Whipple, 1966) as well as physical growth and development (Greene, 1973). Hypoxia, too, may operate to retard menarche (Frisancho and Baker, 1970; Hoff, 1968) as part of its general effect on the pattern of growth and development at high altitude.
A two- or three-year retardation in the average age at menarche may only partially explain the low fertility of Sherpa women. Of greater importance may be the social requirements placed on the families of betrothed couples. Traditionally, these requirements involved a series of gift exchanges and ceremonies that delayed marriage until the mid or late twenties. Among the two older age groups, resurvey

among the Sherpa. Continuous Westernstyle medical services were initiated only five years before our study took place. While the impact of Western medicine has been appreciable, particularly in the acculturated villages, various childhood exanthemas as well as tuberculosis and pneumonia are still common (Lang and Lang, 1971; McKinnon, 1968), and goiter is endemic. These diseases are pervasive, occurring in all villages and in both socioeconomic categories. Consequently, their effect on infant mortality may be equal to or even greater than that of hypoxia.

Only menarche and infant mortality seem unaffected by socioeconomic and/or residence category. Retarded menarchial age and high infant mortality are also reported among high altitude Andean populations and therefore may be influenced by hypoxia. However, it is equally likely that they could be affected by endemic goiter and cretinism, by hypothyroidism, or by the general level of nutrition and health care.

curs before birth, a period for whichdemographic information is rarely complete. Studies directed toward understanding intrauterine development at high altitude may therefore offer the best opportunity for assessing the possible influence of hypoxia on fertility. Postnatal events at high altitude in Nepal seem more directly related to cultural factors.
