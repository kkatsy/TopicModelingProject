ABSTRACT: Small but consistently positive correlations between standing height and general intelligence (the unrotated first principal component across the battery of cognitive tests) were found across sexes, racial/ethnic groups (Americans of European vs. Americans of Japanese ancestry), and generations in data from the Hawaii Family Study of Cognition. Sibling data produced significant height-intelligence correlations for sibling pair means (i.e., betweenfamily differences) but not for within sibling pair differences. The lack of within-family heightintelligence correlations suggested that the two traits were linked due to cross-assortative mating and/or between-family environmental influences (e.g., nutrition) affecting both traits. Some evidence for both of these explanations was found.

As Humphreys et al. (1985) describe in their literature review, numerous studies have obtained small (around 0.20) but consistently positive correlations between standing height and intelligence or correlates of intelligence (e.g., academic achievement, occupation, social class, etc.). Jensen (1980a) proposed that the correlation between height and intelligence was an "extrinsic" correlation appearing between families (i.e., when sibling pair means for height and intelligence are correlated) but not within families (i.e., when sibling pair differences are correlated).
A within-family correlation would suggest pleiotropy, that the same genes are involved in the development of both height and intelligence. When there is only a between-family correlation, however, the two traits may have become linked as a result of (1) cross-assortative mating, where although height and intelligence have no functional relationship to each other, people possessing a

greater degree of one trait are married to spouses possessing a greater degree of the other trait; (2) genetic linkage, due to the genes controlling the two traits being in close proximity on the same chromosome (this correlation, however, would be expected to diminish over several generations of random genetic recombination); and (3) an extrinsic environmental factor operating between but not within families (e.g., social class, cultural background, family nutritional status, etc.) (Jensen, 1980ft). A sibling study by Laycock and Caylor (1964) and a twin study by Husen (1959), in fact, found no evidence for a within-family genetic basis for the height-intelligence correlation.
Jensen has argued for cross-assortative mating as the basis for the height-intelligence correlation, while Husen has argued for the influence of the common intrauterine environment shared by siblings. As noted by Humphreys et al. (1985), either argument would have dif-

ficulties accounting for the changes in the height-intelligence correlations across ages and sexes found by Humphreys et al. Data from the Hawaii Family Study of Cognition (HFSC) (DeFries et al., 1979; Wilson et al., 1975) allow for replications of previous findings and for some tests of hypotheses regarding the basis of the height-intelligence correlation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS
A total of 1,816 families (both biological parents and one or more of their teen-aged or older offspring, for a total of 6,581 individuals) took part in the HFSC (see DeFries et al., 1979, and Wilson et al., 1975, for descriptions of the HFSC). Americans of European ancestry (AEA; 926 families) and Americans of Japanese ancestry (AJA; 368 families) were the two largest racial/ ethnic groups tested in Hawaii. There were 369 AEA families and 115 AJA families with two or more offspring tested, allowing for analyses of between- vs. within-sibship correlations.

across sexes and generations (Nagoshi et al., 1984). First principal component scores were age-corrected by standardizing scores within age bands (DeFries et al., 1979; Wilson et al., 1975). All subjects in the HFSC were also measured on their standing height. Offspring height was age corrected for the present analyses through regression procedures.
In calculating the between-families (BF) and within-families (WF) scores for height and intelligence, only one pair of siblings was used per family, i.e., the oldest and next oldest tested son for brother pair analyses, the oldest and next oldest tested daughter for sister pair analyses, and the oldest tested son and daughter for brother-sister pair analyses. BF scores were the mean score for a sibling pair on a variable, while WF scores were obtained by simply subtracting the score for the second member of the pair from the first. As noted by Jensen (19806), WF difference scores are less reliable than the BF mean scores, but since cognitive factor scores typically have high reliabilities and measured height near perfect reliability, this should not greatly bias the reported results.

MEASURES
The 15 tests that make up the HFSC cognition battery, as well as the alpha reliabilities of the tests and their loadings on the unrotated first principal compoment, are presented in DeFries et al. (1979) and Wilson et al. (1975). Thefirst principal component is a measure of general intelligence and has been found to correlate 0.73 with full-scale Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) scores (Kuse, 1977). The loadings on the unrotated first principal component have been found to be virtually identical across racial/ethnic groups, as well as

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table 1 presents the correlation of height with first principal component scores by generation (parent vs. offspring), sex, and ethnic group (AEA vs. AJA). These correlations are small, but all are positive and consistent with previous studies. We have no obvious explanations for the lower magnitude of the offspring correlations. The magnitude of the offspring correlations did not change when separate correlations were calculated for offspring younger vs. those older than 18 years of age, ruling

out maturational factors as an explanation.
Table 2 presents the BF and WF correlations of height and first principal component scores for offspring brother pairs, sister pairs, and brother-sister pairs separately for AEA and AJA families. These results generally confirm previous findings that the height-intelligence correlation is an extrinsic correlation, i.e., the correlation only exists between and not within families.
For approximately 870 pairs of AEA parents, the spouse correlation for height is 0.22 and for the first principal component 0.23, while for approximately 310 pairs of AJA parents, the corresponding spouse correlations are 0.12 and 0.15. The generally lower spouse correlations, as well as familialities, for AJA compared to AEA families on various HFSC variables have been reported previously (e.g., DeFries

et al., 1979) and may be due to a greater degree of genetic and/or cultural homogeneity in the AJA sample.
If there were no cross-assortative mating for height and intelligence, then the expected correlations of father's height and mother's intelligence and of mother's height and father's intelligence would simply be a product of the separate spouse correlations presented above and the within-individual correlation of height and intelligence presented in Table 1. The expected cross-trait spouse correlation would hence be essentially zero. The actual correlation of father's height and mother's intelligence for AEA parents is 0.12 O < 0.001), while the correlation of mother's height and father's intelligence is 0.07 (p < 0.05). For AJA parents, the corresponding correlations are 0.08 (n.s.) and -0.02 (n.s.). There is thus some evidence for cross-assortative mating for
