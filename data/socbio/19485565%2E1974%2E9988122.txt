Fertility studies done in North America since World War II have generally ignored the gender of respondents as a potentially important factor in accounting for variations in either achieved or preferred family size. Although a number of investigators (see, especially, Blake, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1974) have reported research findings showing clear patterns of differences in fertility values and attitudes between males and females, this fact has so far failed to attract attention as a major focus of analysis and discussion.
The purpose of this paper is to explore this topic and its implications using data on fertility preferences of unmarried male and female students attending selected North American colleges and universities between 1967 and 1973. Documentation of sex differences in family size desires is presented, and social science researches offering possible explanations for the sex differences are reviewed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Since 1963, the authors, independent of each other, have undertaken college and university surveys at eight campuses located in the Northwestern United States and in the Atlantic provinces of Canada. Among our mutual interests was the in-

vestigation of fertility preferences reported by male and female subjects.
A summary of our findings is reported in Table 1 along with those of Westoff and Potvin (1967) and of Buckhout (1972). Our principal interest lies in documenting substantive patterns. Generalizations with respect to the population universe of North American male and female students enrolled at institutions of higher learning is, of course, not possible due to the diverse nature of our samples from the standpoint of design, size, geographical location, and date of execution. With this limitation in mind, the figures at the extreme right of Table 1 indicate clearly that sex differences do exist. On the average, women want more children than do men, and the differences vary from two- to seven-tenths of a child depending on the religious faith of the respondent.
The figures shown in Tables 2 and 3 permit a more detailed analysis of the sex differentials with a variety of relevant demographic-sociological factors controlled. In Table 2, mean desired family sizes are compared between sexes for the combined samples of Catholic students attending Seattle University and the University of Washington in 1967. The following simultaneous controls were introduced: race (all

Caucasian), age (21-23), marital status (all single), religious affiliation (all Catholic), amount of schooling (all seniors), amount of Catholic schooling (all,some, or none), and five separate measures of parental religiosity (high-low). Both the GAF and Princeton studies had shown these variables to be correlated with desired and actual family size.
Again, with due respect for the small sample sizes, a pattern of larger female family size desires is clearly discernible. The differences between men and women amount to an average of approximately seven-tenths of a child which is of the same order of magnitude as that shown for the separate samples in the second row of Table 1. Furthermore, no substantial

changes are evident when number of respondent's siblings is substituted for the index of parental religiosity.
In Table 3, the five academic institutions surveyed in Atlantic Canada in 1969 are combined to make the data more manageable as well as comparable with those shown in the previous table. The controls employed include those cited above with the exception of amount of schooling (freshmen and seniors are combined). Here again, we find substantial differences between males and females, irrespective of respondents' religious affiliation.

Some might argue affirmatively, not uncommon and provide some indication in that it is an unreasonable expectation of the difficulty the respondents had in to believe that young unmarried students determining a preferred family size, of either sex are ready to seriously choose An alternative approach would be to ask a specific family size value and defend it respondents to indicate a size range for with any cogency.

The modal family size range category frequently cited in the fertility literature as descriptive of the "moderately sized North American family" is two to four children. Figures from different publications show that a high proportion (over 80 per cent) of the attitudes sampled fall within this range. Most of these preferences are indicated by married respondents and derived from the summation of responses to particular family size choices; that is, by adding the proportions of respondents who prefer two, three, and four children. Our approach provides a more conservative test of the degree of preference for the 2-4 child range among college students by seeking to document the range itself. The remaining two family size range categories in Table 4 provide some indication of the proportion of respondents who expand the 2-4 range to below replacement level (i.e., 0-4, 1-4, 0-3, and 1-3) and to above four (i.e., 2-5 plus).
The data show that despite the conservative nature of the test most of our respondents (40-50 per cent) still endorse the 2-4 family size range. Sex differences within this range are minimal. However, on the lower and upper sides of the twoto-four range, differences between the sexes obtain. More men than women signify commitment to the lower (A) range; conversely, more women than men prefer the higher (C) range. Even more interesting are the differences between Protestant men and women in the A and C ranges. In the A range, the difference favors the males (38 per cent) over the females (27 per cent). In the C range the difference favors the women (26 per cent) over the males (12 per cent). In sum, the data in Table 4 provide further indication that substantial differences in family-size preferences exist between males and females.
To gain more insight into these differences we examined the frequency distribu-

tions of the family-size preferences in four separate sample surveys--Westoff and Potvin, 1963; Nobbe, 1967; Okraku, 1969; Nobbe and Okraku, 1973. The results of the analysis (Table 5), done separately for Catholics and Protestants in each sample, corroborate the differences noted earlier. The data also suggest that important changes in the proportions of men and women indicating preference for various family-size values may have been occurring since 1963. We have summarized these changes separately for Catholics and Protestants in light of the apparent influence of religious affiliation in the dependent variable. However, we are aware that there is an obvious methodological limitation in interpreting the data in Table 5 in terms of changes over time. Because of the diverse nature of the samples involved, it is quite conceivable that the differences evident in Table 5 reflect not so much changes in family size preference patterns as differences in the types of institutional and geographical environments sampled.
It appears that increasingly smaller percentages of Catholic men and women endorse preferences for five or more children, the rapidity of this decline being especially prominent among women (53 per cent in 1963 down to 14 per cent in 1973). In fact, in the 1969 and 1973 samples, the sex differentials at this value level are virtually nonexistent.
Approximately one-third of our male and female subjects at three time periods (1967, 1969, and 1973) are partial to a four-child family. Again, slightly greater percentages of women than men favor this fertility value.
Most dramatic perhaps are the apparent increases in the preferences for two or fewer children, and also for three children. For Catholic women, the attractiveness of a three-child family seems to have increased

steadily over the decade. The percentage of women of all religions who desire two or fewer children has also increased markedly. At the same time, it appears that Catholic male students have been increasingly interested in a two-child family, Thirty-two per cent of our 1973 male respondents chose that value compared with IS per cent in the 1967 sample.
In sum, the impression created by these data is that of an optimal range between three and four children preferred by Catholic students, with women favoring the higher of the two values at the present time.

Unfortunately, the sex comparisons among Protestants are available only for 1969 and 1973. Even with that limitation, changes are evident. There are substantial declines in the number of men and women desiring five or more children. Proportionately, however, twice as many women as men at both time periods fall in this category.
The proportionate declines over time are also evident for males and females in the four-child family category, although the declines here have been more pronounced among males. Three times as many women as men preferred this particular fertility

value in the 1973 sample, whereas there was virtually no difference between the sexes in the 1969 sample.
While there is considerable agreement among the sexes concerning the desirability of three children in both the 1969 and 1973 samples, the comparison of greatest surprise occurs in the two-children-orfewer category. Though the sex differentials remain in the expected direction (i.e., more men than women desiring two children or fewer), there is a substantial increase in the magnitudes of the percentages of both sexes choosing this category during the four-year interval.
Our data suggest that the optimal range of children wanted by Protestants lies between two and three, with males preferring the former value and women the latter figure.
DISCUSSION
The data we have presented above demonstrate clearly that substantial differences in family size preferences exist between college men and women, with the latter preferring higher values than the former; and that these differences remain after the effects of a variety of demographic and social factors have been taken into account. The socialization process by which humans acquire their sex roles from family, school, and significant reference groups such as peers is usually invoked as a possible explanation of these sex differentials. Of direct relevance here, of course, is the acquisition of roles that eventually translate into marriage, motherhood, and housewife for women and marriage, fatherhood, and work for men (Parsons and Bales, 1955). In the words of Judith Blake (1972, p. 5):
Role differentiation by sex in American society makes actual or anticipated parenthood a pre-condition for all other aspects of men's and women's roles. The content of sex roles--men's and women's "spheres"--

uses as a bench mark the sexually differentiated relation to child-bearing and rearing. The feminine role is normatively maternal and, hence, intra-familial, "integrative," emotionally supportive, and "expressive." The masculine role is normatively paternal and, as a result, primarily the complement of the maternal role--extrafamilial, protective, economically supportive, and "instrumental" (or "task-oriented") . . . .
Her summary aptly characterizes the responses given by our student subjects in the 1973 sample to a question concerning their most important reason for indicating a specific family value preference. Fortyeight per cent of the females, as compared to 27 per cent of the males, answered in terms of content that centered around such themes as family cohesion, interpersonal relations between the children themselves and/or mother-child, and biological fulfillment, and size of family of orientation.
By contrast, the modal category of response to this question by males was in terms of content that related to work and income. The importance of breadwinning, developing a career, and meeting financial ends was stressed by 25 per cent of the men and 15 per cent of the women.
Recent empirical studies (Rosenkrantz et al., 1968; Broverman et al., 1972) of college students dealing with self-concepts and sex role stereotypes lend further credence to this view at the psychological level. Broverman et al. (1972, p. 75), for example, summarize their findings as follows:
Women are perceived as relatively less competent, less independent, less objective, and less logical than men; men are perceived as lacking interpersonal sensitivity, warmth, and expressiveness in comparison to women. Moreover, stereotypically masculine traits are more often perceived to be desirable than are stereotypically feminine characteristics. Most importantly, both men and women incorporate both the positive and negative traits of the appropriate stereotype into their self-concepts. Since more feminine traits are negatively valued than

286

Nobbe and Okraku

Social Biology

are masculine traits, women tend to have more negative self-concepts than do men. The tendency for women to denigrate themselves in this manner can be seen as evidence of the powerful social pressures to conform to the sex role standards of the society . . . .
The pronatalistic implications of such findings are evident. Women want children and within a range determined by the extent of their endorsement of prescribed as well as proscribed role expectations. Several studies (e.g., Clarkson et al., 1970; Hoffman and Wyatt, 1960), as well as reviews of studies (e.g., Blake, 1965) provide indirect evidence in support of this view. Unfortunately, none of these studies was able to establish a direct causal link between sex role attitudes and actual fertility. A closer approximation is achieved in a recent investigation of single Catholic college females (Broverman et al., 1972) in which the authors observed that ideal family size desires and maternal employment aspirations varied as a function of the women's perceived self-concept measured in terms of a cluster of male-valued competency traits. High competency scores were associated with low family-size preferences and strong propensities for work outside the family as a married mother. Most regrettably, there seems to be no similar research in which young males are also the object of study.
In recent years, demographers have also become more aware of the importance of early socialization in the shaping of fertility norms of young adolescents and teenagers (e.g., Westoff and Potvin, 1967; Gustavus and Nam, 1970). Westoff and Potvin (1967) have argued that number of siblings may be an important determinant in shaping family size norms during the period of late childhood to early adolescence. Their research established modest but positive correlations between size of family of orientation and size of

family desired among Protestant and Catholic females. If it could be shown that the relationship between these two variables was' substantially higher among women relative to men, then this factor could be investigated as a possible explanation for sex differences in family size preferences. However, our analyses do not support this view. Our correlation coefficients for number of siblings and preferred family size were positive in sign and of almost exactly the same order of magnitude for Protestants and Catholics as those shown in the Westoff-Potvin research; but there were no differences by sex worthy of mention.
Another possible source of explanation for the family size differences established in this study is the socialization experiences of adults. Smuts (1959) in a thorough demographic review argued that changes in the feminine role, such as increased employment, should not be taken to mean that women were forsaking their traditional family obligations of childbearing and childraising. In fact, he points out that married women are particularly likely to work before the birth of the first child and after the last child has been enrolled in school. The latter trend in particular accounted for the major increase in the female labor force participation in the United States between 1940 and 1960 (Oppenheimer, 1957). Hartley (1960, p. 156) subsequently undertook extensive indepth interviews with a small sample of working mothers and arrived at a similar conclusion. She writes:
Most of the working mothers we interviewed consider their work as an aspect of the nurturant function. It is another way in which they can serve their families--they add to it the traditional roster of womanly duties and see it as another way of helping their husbands and providing for the needs of their children . . . .
Other writers have explored different implications of the wife's employment out-

side the home. Research on changes in the role structure of the family, for example, has shown that the wife's power in rolebargaining is related to her employment (Heer, 1958). However, the evidence in support of this finding is not conclusive (Hoffman, 1960). Furthermore, the connection between an increase in a woman's effective social power and the change in her family size preference has never been examined to our knowledge.
SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
Sex differentials in desired family size may be profitably studied in the years ahead by more sustained and intensive research on male and female subjects (both unmarried and married) using family size preference as the dependent variable. However, what is problematic with such survey work is the penchant for adhering to "global" variables (e.g., social class, religion, race, ethnicity, place of residence, size of family of orientation) and establishing the existence of relationships between these variables and some measure of fertility. Occasionally, the demographer is content to terminate the analysis at this point. More frequently, however, some effort is made to interpret the relationships, often in terms of social psychological factors which are usually not amenable to further empirical scrutiny and analysis because the appropriate data were never collected. We suggest more longitudinal studies (e.g., Gustavus and Nam, 1970) conducted on smaller samples of men and women starting with the period of early adolescence (say, age 8 to 13) and continuing through later years. The interviews should be in-depth and of an unstructured nature, designed to get at the qualitative content of family life that is routinely passed.
As for the sex variable in this type of research, we would suggest work along

two possible lines of inquiry. First, a more

thorough investigation is needed to assess

the impact of working and nonworking

mothers on their children's (especially

daughters') attitudes about what family

and work roles they will choose as adults.

Research findings show, for example, that

significantly more daughters of working

mothers indicate interest in selecting non-

traditional vocations than do daughters of

nonworking mothers (Hartley, 1960). This

finding is consistent with research con-

ducted on career saliency as perceived by

college women (Almquist and Angrist,

1971). Here, it was found that career-

directed women students had been signifi-

cantly more strongly influenced by college

professors and occupational role models

than were noncareer-directed students. By

logical extension, it may be found that

prospective wives influenced by such

"models" will prefer fewer children rela-

tive to young women not exposed to such

models.

A second line of research inquiry centers around studies of family social structure and value consensus. Writers such as Winch (1963) have noted the increase of the isolated nuclear family in the United States as the ideal type of family form espoused by the urban middle class. Characteristic of this family type among middle-class populations is the stress on egalitarianism between spouses, involving decreasing differentiation of stereotyped parental sex roles and a greater emphasis on compromise, cooperation, and joint decision-making concerning all vital aspects of family life. The implications for fertility would seem to be an increased sensitivity on the part of marriage partners towards differences in their attitudes about number of children wanted. How these differences are resolved requires that we view the prospective couples' family-formation behavior as an outcome of a decision-making
