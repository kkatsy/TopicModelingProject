Is it a coincidence that Hermes was the Greek god of both science and travel? The brain drain, or the migration of scientists and technologists from one country to another, may well have originated in the conjunction of these two pursuits in one deity. Dedijer (1968) has chronicled the peregrinations of early scientists. One of the reasons for travel has always been the desire to be where the scientific action is. For example, during the Middle Ages, Erasmus recorded how bitterly a young Cambridge don complained to him about his inability to get out of that isolated spot and into the center of culture at Rome (Hayes, 1973, p. 106).
After World War II, permanent migration, as opposed to temporary migration for the purpose of study or research, became a much more significant part of international science than it had been previously. The reasons for this change are widespread and have been commented on extensively (Beyer, 1972; Spiegel-Rosing, 1973, pp. 251-254): the increased ease of international travel, the unprecedented growth of science in the more economically advanced countries, and so on.
The concern over the emigration of scientists could be divided into two parts. The first dealt with the movement of European

scientists to North America; the second, with the movement of scientists from the developing countries to Europe and North America. Because of the larger numbers involved, the Europe-North America transfers attracted the most attention. Anxiety over this scientific migration reached a peak in the middle and late 1960's. The readjustment of national currency values since then has alleviated to some extent the salary imbalance between the two continents which was one of the main impulses for the migration.
However, the brain drain from the developing countries may be greater now than a decade ago. A New York Times story (March 24, 1974), headlined "Loss of Skilled is Worrying India," emphasized the problem. One doctor was quoted as claiming that 80 per cent of her medical class of 1967 had left India for the United States, Canada, and Australia. According to an Indian report referred to in the story, about 45,000 scientists, engineers, and physicians have departed permanently over the past fifteen years.
The object of this paper is to evaluate the significance of the brain drain on developing countries. Because the migration of scientists is an economic and social loss, legal barriers have sometimes been erected

to control it. Surreptitious activities, such as the nonreporting of movements across borders, have resulted, with subsequent doubt being cast about the validity of official statistics. Also, definitions of what constitutes technical personnel vary from country to country, further obscuring data on migration. A relatively standardized method of measuring the brain drain, by using the numbers of scientists publishing in the major technical journals of the world, can be used to diminish some of these statistical problems.
In order to be regarded as a substantial loss, a country's brain drain should encompass a significant proportion of the stock of trained personnel of that land. Unfortunately, information on the overall number of these personnel is difficult to obtain. One of the few available statistics (Coutsoumaris, 1968, p. 170) shows that Greece lost about 7 per cent of her scientists during the period 1961-65, a significant proportion by any measure.
Because India has by far the largest number of scientists and engineers of any developing country it was chosen for this study. Data on Indian migration to the United States have been published, but data are less accessible for migration to other countries. The number of scientists and engineers entering the United States from India rose as follows from 1956 to 197O1: 41 in 1956; 89 in 1965; 875 in 1966, the year after a change in immigration laws; 1,415 in 1969; 2,760 in 1970. While these numbers have shown a dramatic increase, their significance in terms of the total number of Indian scientists and engineers remains to be explored.
Who is Publishing in Science (WIPIS), published by the Institute for Scientific Information, Philadelphia, lists alphabeti-
1 Figures for 1956, 1965, and 1966 are from U.S. Congress, 1967. Figures for 1969 are from Fortney, 1972. Figures for 1970 are from Matley, 1973.

cally first-named authors of publications in most of the major journals of the world. The limitations of WIPIS have been discussed in an earlier article (Inhaber, 1974). While the list gives only those scientists who published in a given year, and not their absolute number, it is a method for producing a standardized count.
To compare the extent of the brain drain with the number of scientists left in India, the place of publication of uniquely Indian names was considered. If the brain drain from a country like Japan had been considered, the measurement would have been complicated by the substantial Japanese migration to Western countries, especially the United States, for a considerable length of time. As a result, a scientist with a Japanese name may have been born outside Japan. The problem is slight in the Indian case, since most immigration from India has been comparatively recent.
Results for 43 groups of common Indian names are shown in Table 1. The difference between the years 1967 and 1972 was taken as a measure of the brain drain over a reasonably long length of time. The names in Table 1 were, generally speaking, the most frequently encountered in the WIPIS list of scientists in India for both 1967 and 1972. They made up 37.3 per cent of all scientists in India in 1967 and 32.8 per cent in 1972. The total number of scientists rose considerably by the latter year due to more complete coverage by WIPIS and natural increase.
Table 1 shows that some names are more concentrated in India than others. For 1967, the highest concentrations in India were the groups Sastri, Basu, and Verma; the lowest were Shah, Srinavasan, and Patel. For 1972, the corresponding groups were Sastri, Srivastava, and Tiwari; Shah, Patel, and Ganguli.

be the same for the two years considered. To test this statement, thefraction of scientists in each name group in India in1967 was correlated with the same fraction in 1972. The coefficient was 0.64, significant at the 1 per cent level. A similar test was applied to the fractions in the United States. Thecorrelation coefficient was 0.57, again significant at the 1 per cent level. The coefficients for scientists in the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries did not meet this test of significance. This finding is probably due to the smaller numbers of scientists involved, producing some large proportional variations in the fractions.
Has the Indian brain drain since 1967 been a significant part of the total number of Indian scientists? Figure 1 shows the answer to this question. The data were divided into six geographical areas: India, United States, United Kingdom, Canada, other European countries, and all others. Based on thenames of Table 1, the proportion of Indian scientists in India dropped 1.0 per cent a year for the five years under consideration. The proportion of these scientists in the United States increased by almost the same amount, 0.9 per cent a year. As fractions of the 1967 proportions, the number in India had fallen by 7.S per cent and had risen by 23 per cent in the United States five years later.
The other areas of the world showed comparatively little percentage change, as shown in Figure 1. The proportion of all Indian scientists showed a slight drop of about 0.0S per cent a year in the United Kingdom, while the fraction in Canada increased by about 0.26 per cent a year, from 4.4per cent to 5.7per cent. Compared to its 1967 fraction, Canada showed the largest proportional change of about 30 per cent.
Other areas of the world showed comparatively little change. The proportion of

FIG. 1.--Change in proportion of Indian scientists in various countries and areas, from 1967 to 1972.

Indian scientists in other developing countries remained very small for both years considered. The small numbers recorded for countries outside of Europe and North America (Col. 6 of Fig. 1) show that there

was comparatively little distortion of the data due to the similarity of some Pakistani and Indian names.
How significant were the changes in proportion? The number of scientists in each

of the six areas of Figure 1 expected on the basis of the 1967 proportions was compared to the actual number in 1972,holding the total number constant. The chi-square value, with five degrees of freedom, was 60.8. The change from 1967 to 1972 was significant at the 1 per cent level. To consider the statistics from another point of view, simple extrapolation of this trend shows that if the 1967 to 1972 trend continues, by 1982the number of Indian scientists in the United States could be about 63 per cent of those in India, and only about half of Indian scientists will be in their native land.

In summary, Western interest in the brain drain seems to have dropped during the very years that it was becoming important for the developing countries. Figure 1 shows that a significant proportion of the stock of Indian scientists was lost from 1967 to 1972, primarily to economically advanced countries. Because India has the largest number of scientists of any developing country, the results are disturbing. Similar calculations mayshow the same results for other developing countries. The brain drain evidently did not cease when many British and German scientists returned home from the United States.
