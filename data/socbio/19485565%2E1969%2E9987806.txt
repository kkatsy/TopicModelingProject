Historical data from Norway and Sweden are used to illustrate the methodology as well as to present a clear picture of the trend of illegitimacy in those countries.
Some remarks about the main features of our methodology may be appropriate here. Let us assume we have sets of data on four demographic factors at ten-year intervals, and we would like to study the trend of illegitimacy in terms of these four factors on a decade-to-decade basis. For each decade we want to identify one or more demographic factors whose change brought about the observed change in the level of illegitimacy, and then we want to determine the relative contribution of each factor. The direct approach to this goal involves many standardization processes. Thus, the analysis may become tedious to the researcher and reader alike. For example, in the case of four factors one has to perform fourteen different standardizations to exhaust all the possibilities.1 In this paper we describe a simple procedure of demographic manipulation by which the observed change in the level can be almost fully explained by performing only one or two standardizations. Our procedure enables us to quickly select the most important factor or combination of factors; then the relevant standardizations can be easily performed.
An important aspect of standardization technique is the selection of a standard population. There are no fixed rules, and the population selected largely depends on the problem at hand. We believe that the selection should be conceptually meaningful so that the results of standardization can be interpreted easily. For our purposes, we have chosen the population for the first year of each decade as the "standard population," rather than selecting one common "standard population" for the whole analy-

sis. For example, if we wanted to explain the change in the level of illegitimacy during 1950-60 in Sweden in terms of changes in the marital distribution, it is more meaningful to select either the 1950 or the 1960 marital distribution as "standard" than to select some other marital distribution, such as that of 1900 (which is the beginning year in the illustrative examples in this paper). An example wherein the selection of a common standard population is quite appropriate is provided by Coale (1967) in his

We have not attempted to determine the exact contributions of each of the demographic factors in terms of their independent effects and their interaction effects. The necessary methods are available, but they are quite lengthy and complicated. An authoritative account of such methods is given by Kitagawa (1955).

macy between two dates (e.g., two consecutive census years).
For the purpose of this study, an illegitimate birth is one which occurs to an unmarried (single, widowed, or divorced) female; consequently, any birth occurring to a currently married female is legitimate. The following symbols will be used:
x = age group xto x-f- 4 years, or age x if data are in single years of age;
Fx = number of females at age x; fx = proportion, at age x, of all females in
childbearing period (15-44 years); qx = proportion of total females at age x
who are unmarried; ix = age-specific illegitimate fertility rate
(number of illegitimate births per unmarried female of age xper year); j x = age-specific legitimate fertility rate (number of legitimate births per married female of age xper year).

^L,x(l

Thus, the Illegitimacy Ratio, which represents illegitimate births as a proportion of total births, may be presented as follows:

the Illegitimacy Ratio, the standardized Ratio would be given by
3. These expressions are helpful in visualizing the direction of change in the Rate or the Ratio when one or more demographic factors changes its level. For example, a change in the level of qx would have little effect on the Rate because it occurs both in the numerator and denominator (equation [3]). On the other hand, if the level of qx rises, it has a dual effect on the Illegitimacy Ratio. A rise in qx, and consequently the decline in (1 -- qx), would sharply reduce the value of the quotient
Hence the Illegitimacy Ratio would increase sharply. This is what we mean by a dual effect.
4. The Illegitimacy Rate as expressed in the form of equation (3) clearly indicates that it is a weighted mean of ix's--the agespecific illegitimacy rates. The weights are fx qx. Thus, it would remain more stable with respect to changes in fx and qx than the Illegitimacy Ratio.
5. Each of the sums has useful qualitative and quantitative meanings:
S/t^i = the overall probability of being single in the childbearing ages. It can also be phrased as the overall proportion single in the childbearing ages.
2fxqxix = the overall probability of giving birth to an illegitimate child by afemale (not an unmarried female, but any female) in the childbearing ages in a population with a given age and marital distribution. It can also

called the general rate of illegitimacy.
2/r(l -- qx)jx -- the overall probability of giving birth to a legitimate child by a female (not a married female, but any female) in the childbearing ages in a population with a given age and marital distribution. It can also be called the general rate of legitimacy.
It should be noted here that the sums 2fxqJx and S/^l -- qx)jx are not the exact expressions of the respective probabilities. They should be regarded as estimators or approximations of the probabilities, because ix and/* are the central-rates for the period rather than the probabilities. In spite of this limitation, we have used the word "probability" because it provides a consistent way to define the term "level of illegitimacy" and its measures in our following discussion.
The term "level of illegitimacy" can be interpreted as the probability of occurrence of an illegitimate birth to a specified female. Since, by definition, a birth occurring to an unmarried female is classified as illegitimate, the level of illegitimacy is best measured by determining the probability of an unmarried female bearing a child during her childbearing years. This probability is measured by the Illegitimacy Rate as defined above by equation (3). The denominator consists of a population (unmarried females in the childbearing ages) exposed to the risk of the event (illegitimacy) mentioned in the numerator. Thus, it is a probability measure of the level of illegitimacy.
Now we can relax the specifications for the female. If the population exposed to the risk of illegitimacy is defined as being composed of females in childbearing ages (irrespective of their marital status), the probability measure of the level of illegitimacy would be the sum 2fxqJx. Therefore, depending on the question asked, both measures,

96

the Illegitimacy Rate and 2fxqxiz, can be used to indicate the level of illegitimacy.
In this paper, we have designated the sum 2/x^x^ as the general probability of illegitimacy or general rate of illegitimacy and the sum 2/3(1 -- qx)jx as the general probability of legitimacy or general rate of legitimacy. The general probability of illegitimacy is the probability of joint occurrence of two independent events--first, the probability that the female is unmarried, and second, that she bears a child. Thus, according to the laws of probability of joint occurrence of independent events, we would get
2fxqxix = Illegitimacy Rate X
This is the same expression as equation (3). In this paper we have used both measures (the general probability of illegitimacy and the Illegitimacy Rate) primarily because their comparison yields the relative influence of the marital distribution on illegitimacy.
As defined in equation (1), the Illegitimacy Ratio shows illegitimate births as a proportion of all births in a given year. If the object is to measure the prevalence of illegitimacy in relation to legitimacy, the Illegitimacy Ratio would be an appropriate index; but it is not a proper measure of the level of illegitimacy as defined above. Therefore, when the Ratio is described as the "level of illegitimacy," as sometimes happens in the literature, it could be misleading. The popularity of the Illegitimacy Ratio is due to its simple meaning and to the simplicity of collecting the data. One source, the vital registration system, is sufficient to compute the Ratio. We have already discussed the fact that the Ratio could be influenced in many ways without any change in ix. As an additional example, a decline in the level of marital fertility, j x , would increase the Illegitimacy Ratio, and this could lead to an incorrect conclusion that the level of illegitimacy (in the probability sense) is rising. Therefore, the Ratio should be used

with great caution. We shall encounter examples in the present analysis which show its misuse.
Keeping the above discussion of this section in mind, we now formulate the general mode of analysis. When one compares the values of the three sums (2/x^, ~Zfxqxix, and S/*(l -- qx)jx) at two successive dates, the comparison provides certain clues as to which demographic factors have caused a change, if any, in the level of illegitimacy during the period.
Here, a question can be raised as to why the demographic factors are identified by comparing the three sums rather than by directly observing the data. Generally, the basic data are stated in six quinquennial age groups in the childbearing ages. There will be no problem in identifying a demographic factor if all six values encountered have changed in the same direction. Then we can say conclusively that this demographic factor must have contributed to the observed change in the level of illegitimacy. But, when the age-specific levels have changed in opposite directions, we cannot state conclusively the overall direction and significance of the demographic factor. The problem becomes more acute when data are given in single years of age. To state the answer with some confidence, one must compute an overall index of the demographic factor; but, to do so in the case of ix and j x , we may be begging the basic question. The Swedish age-specific illegitimacy rates in 1940 and 1950 are an example of the problem (see Table 11). In any case, the method of comparison of the three sums (as described below) can take care of all the situations. It also reduces the number of calculations.
The following systematic method can be used to identify the demographic factors for standardization by comparing the values of the three sums. It should be noted that the various implications of different situations in the following classification are most likely to be true in the domain of demographic pos-

We shall compute the Illegitimacy Ratio and the Illegitimacy Rate corresponding to a given set of four demographic variables, fx, qx, ix, and j x , for which the basic data are presented in Tables 2-5. It would be a very space-consuming task if we were to reproduce a detailed computational table in each case. Therefore, only the final results of the computation are presented. However, we shall illustrate the detailed computational procedure with reference to Norway, 1900, in Table 6. The sum 2/#* means that 58.4%

of the females aged 15-44 years were unmarried; the sum 2fxqJx implies that the probability of bearing an illegitimate child by a female aged 15-44 years was 0.0099 (9.9 illegitimate births per 1,000 females of childbearing age in 1900); and the sum 2/x(l -- qx)jx implies that the probability of bearing a legitimate child by a female 1544 years old was 0.1280 (128.0 legitimate births per 1,000 females of childbearing age in 1900). Incidentally, it can be easily seen that the general fertility rate, that is, the number of births per female of childbearing age, equals [ 2 / ^ + 2/^(1 -- qx)jx]. Thus, the general fertility rate for Norway was 137.9 per 1,000 females 15-44 years of age in 1900.
The trends of illegitimacy ratios, illegitimacy rates, and general probabilities of illegitimacy (2fxgxix) are shown in Table 7. The illegitimacy ratios and rates do not fol-

low the same trend. Although their 1960 levels areabout half of those in 1900, they have different patterns during the intervening period. Apart from significant differences in the magnitude of the per cent decline since 1900 (compare cols. 3 and 5), the rates and ratios even show different directionsof change during some periods. Between 1930 and 1946, the index of the ratio declined by 18 points while that of the rate showed a rise of 17 points. Onthe other hand, theillegitimacy rate and general probability of illegitimacy follow the same trend up to 1930. But, in 1960, thegeneral probability of illegitimacy is 66% of the1900 estimate as against 46% inthe case ofthe illegitimacy rate. Thedifference in the two indicesoccurs because of changes in themarital distribution (2fxqx). In this case, the mean age

at marriage seems to have reduced significantly during 1930-60. We shall attempt to explore thedemographic causes of changes in the level of illegitimacy during each successive period.
1900-10. Table 8 contains thevalues of the three sums and other necessary computations for theperiod 1900-10. A comparison of the values of the sum 2fxqx shows that there were no significant changes in marital distribution during 1900-10, but the sums 2fxqxix were reduced considerably over the same period (cols. 2and 3). This means that there was a significant reduction of ix's, age-specific illegitimacy rates. There is also some reduction in 2/x(l -- qx)jx, the probability of bearing a legitimate child.
With these clues regarding the behavior of demographic factors affecting the il-

legitimacy level, we may now test our hypothesis that ix is the major demographic factor which has caused changes in the level of illegitimacy asindicated by the Illegitimacy Rate and Efxqxix. The 1910 ratios and rates are recomputed byreplacing the ix column with the ix column of 1900, that is, standardizing the 1910 rates and ratios with respect to the age-specific illegitimacy rates. Using the computational procedure outlined in Table 5, we get the standardized Ratio and Rate for 1910 as shown in column 4of Table 8. The standardized Illegitimacy Rate and the general probability of illegitimacy are equal to those in 1900, implying that there was a real decline inthe illegitimacy level between 1900 and 1910 (since there was no change in marital conditions). However, the standardized Ratio (81.3) is higher than the 1900 level (72.1). This occurred because the level oijx's, age-specific legitimacy rates, have also declined. This is one illustration of the procedure which accounts for changes in theillegitimacy level in terms of the demographic factors.
1910-20 (cols. 2, 3, and 4in Table 9). To avoid duplications, we shall present the analysis oftrends during the years 1910to 1960 in Table 9. The calendar-year column headings with an asterisk denote an Illegitimacy Ratio and Rate which are standardized with respect to thedemographic factor mentioned in theheading (the new level of the demographic factor always corresponds to its level at the previous date).
During this period, there were no changes in 2/xffc, that is, marital distribution did not change. But, there wasa reduction in 2/z(l -- qx)jx, and an increase in 2fxqzixTherefore, we have standardized the 1920 indices with respect to both ix and j x . The resemblance between the 1910 and1920 (col. 4) illegitimacy indices is very close. This implies that the changes inix and j x (age-specific illegitimate and legitimate fertility rates) were wholly responsible for thf

observed changes in the illegitimacy indices between 1910 and 1920.
1920-30 (cols. 3, 5, and 6 in Table 9). Comparing the three sums from Table 9 listed above, we find that there are drastic declines in the probabilities of illegitimate and legitimate births. Columns 6 and 3 show that when we standardize the 1930 Ratio and the Rate with respect to both ix andjx, the changes during the decade are clearly shown. One interesting thing to observe is that there was a drastic decline (from 14.6 to 8.7) in the Illegitimacy Rate, but comparatively little decline in the Ratio. The decline in the levels of ix and j x tend to counterbalance their net effect on the value of the quotient (2/x[l -- qx]jx)/(^Mxis), and consequently on the Ratio. The direction of change in the Ratio depends on the relative speed of the decline of 2/^(1 -- qx)jx and 2/x<7ziz. In the present case, the speed of decline of the latter sum is greater than that of the former, and therefore the quotient increases; hence, the ratio decreases (equation [2]). This was the underlying mechanism of decline in the Illegitimacy Ratio from 75.7 to 70.0 during the decade 1920-30.
1930-46 (cols. 5, 7, 8, and 9 in Table9). A comparison of the three sums between 1930 and 1946 (cols. 4 and 7) reveals that there are significant reductions in the probability of remaining single (about 17%) and the probability of bearing a legitimate child (about 32%). Though there is a less significant rise (about 7%) in the probability of bearing an illegitimate child (2/#x4), the observed illegitimacy rate shows an increase of 29%.
What can we learn from these figures? The level of qx has certainly gone down (and some changes have also occurred in/x). This fact could account for a good part of the observed increase in the value of 2/x(l -- qx)jx during this period. We can say something about the behavior of ix's only after we have established the role of changes in the level of qx. Therefore, qx is selected as a first factor

of standardization (col. 8). The standardized sum 2/xgz becomes almost equal to the 1930 value and the standardized sum 2/^(1 -- Qx)jx accounts for about two-thirds of the total increase during 1930-46. Thus, there was a substantial decrease in the level of qx's during this period. In addition, the standardized value of the general probability of illegitimacy becomes about 24% more than the 1930 level, while the observed difference is only 7%. This fact implies that there was a significant increase in the level of ix's during 1930-46; otherwise, in the face of a substantial decrease in the level of ?x's, the standardized sum Xf^Jx should have decreased. Thus, the level of all the demographic factors has changed during this period. Column 9 standardized the 1946 values with respect to qx, ix, and j x , and they compare very well with those in column 5. Obviously, the remaining differences are due to changes in the level of fx.

1946-50 (cols. 7, 10, and 11, in Table 9).

Comparing the three sums, we note that

2/xjx and 2>fxqJx have reduced appreciably. Thus qx and ix may be the important demographic factors which have caused the

change in the illegitimacy level.2 Column 11

shows the results of standardization with re-

spect to qx and ix. We observe that the change in the Illegitimacy Rate is fully ex-

plained and the difference in Illegitimacy

Ratio is reduced. The remaining difference

in the Illegitimacy Ratios (between 57.3 and

65.3) would be explained byjx since there is

a significant difference in magnitude of

2/x(l -- qx)jx between columns 7 and 11.

1950-55 (cols. 10,12, and 13 in Table 9).

This is an excellent example to illustrate the

"dual" effect of change in qx on the Ratio.

By standardizing the 1955 illegitimacy indices with respect to qx, the resulting indices of 44.3 and 8.6 (col. 13) become very close to those of 41.3 and 8.5 (col. 10). Thus, the decline in the level of gX) meaning that the proportion married has increased, was responsible for the decline in the Ratio but had absolutely no effect on the Illegitimacy Rate during 1950-55. How could this happen? A decline in the level of qx implies a rise in the level of 1 -- qx. These two appear in the numerator and denominator of the quotient (2/41 - qAjxffl&jx). The result is that both acted in the same direction, that is, towards increasing the value of the quotient--the dual effect of qx. This, in turn, decreased the valueof the Illegitimacy Ratio from 41.3 to 34.6 during 1950-55.
1955-60. There were relatively minor changes in the illegitimacy level during this period; therefore, there is no need for any analysis.
Conclusion. The analysis of the Norwegian data makes it quite clear that a description of the trend of the illegitimacy level is not as simple as Table 7 tends to show. An in-depth analysis is a precondition to drawing any conclusions concerning the trend and level of illegitimacy. There were genuine declines in the level of illegitimacy shown by the fact that we had to standardize with respect to ix, age-specific illegitimacy rates, four times in six periods to find the explanation for the trend. Another important conclusion is that we would have been terribly misled had we relied wholly on illegitimacy ratios as indices of the level of illegitimacy. Since 1930, changes in the marital distribution of females have affected the illegitimacy ratios considerably. Marital fertility rates, j x , have also been an important cause of change in illegitimacy ratios in Norway. Finally, the sums 2 / ^ , 2fxqxix, and 2/^(1 -- px)jx have declined by 39%, 67%, and 33%, respectively, during 1900-60. These remarkable changes reflect the fact that the demographic factors which

determine the level of illegitimacy have undergone drastic changes in Norway.
SWEDEN
The methodology of analysis in the case of Sweden will be the same as we have described in detail for Norway. Therefore, we shall describe the rest of the analysis by presenting detailed tables with brief descriptions, highlighting only the important features. The data for demographic factors are shown in Tables 10-13.
Table 14 shows that the illegitimacy rates and ratios reveal an entirely different trend. During 1900-60, the Ratio did not decline much, but the Rate dropped by 23% and the general probability of illegitimacy (2fxqJx) by 49%. The general probability remained constant, around 0.0075, during 1940-60 but the Illegitimacy Rate has increased significantly (from 14.8 to 20.0). This would mean that qx is acting as a counterbalance. During 1910-20, 1920-30, 1940-50 and 1950-60, the rates and ratios follow opposite directions of change. The following paragraphs offer a brief explanation of the causes of the trend of illegitimacy in Sweden.
Table 15 gives a more or less self-explanatory analysis of the trend of illegitimacy in Sweden. The brief notes for the decades are as follows:
1900-10 (cols. 2, 3, and 4, of Table 15). The significant rise of the Ratio, but with no such change in the Rate, was caused by a decline in the level of legitimacy (compare the sums 2/^(1 --qx)jx) during this period. This fact becomes obvious from column 4.
1910-20 (cols. 3, 5, and 6, of Table 15). A comparison of the three sums between 1910 and 1920 suggests an appreciable decline (about 10%) in the level of general probability of legitimacy (2/^(1 -- qx)jx). At the same time, there is no significant difference between the 1910 and 1920 values of 2/x<fc. Therefore, j x is chosen as a factor of standardization. Column 6 shows very

er than that of 'Zfxqxix. The observed figures, showing a 38.4% and 35.4% decline respectively from 1920 to 1930, support this conclusion.
Since the difference between the rates of decline of the two components is small (3%), it resulted in an insignificant increase in the Ratio (4%) during 1920-30. However, the 35.4% decline in the 2fxqJx resulted in the decline of the Illegitimacy Rate by the same magnitude. In other words, the marital distribution did not affect the illegitimacy level during this period. Finally, the standardized Ratio and Rate (with respect to ix and jj; simultaneously) of 1930 (col. 8) compare very well with those of 1920.

In view of this decline, the observed significant rise in the probability of a legitimate child, 2fx(l--qx)jx, should be interpreted carefully. It is more likely to be due to increase in (1 --qx) rather than in j x . To support our conjecture we note that in 1940 2/z(l -- qx)jx = 0.056407 and in 1950 (col. 13) 2/x(l - qx')jx = 0.056318 (where qj = 1940). This is the reason we did not include j x as the factor of standardization.

macy Ratio during 1950-60. We note that the sum 2/^(1 -- qx)jz has decreased, while the other two sums did not change significantly. Therefore, asastarting point,we should select j x asafactor of standardization. However, inthis case, we prefer to depart from the general approach. Table 10 shows remarkable differences infx values between 1950 and 1960. Therefore, we have standardized the 1960indices withrespect to fx (see col. 15). Although we get approximately thesame values of Illegitimacy Rate and Ratio asthose of 1950, we are tempted to call this acoincidence. After the standardization, instead of mimimizing the differences, the differences in2 / ^ and SfxqJz were increased (compare col. 12 and 15). We also know from the observed figures that the level of j x has changed during this period. The whole situation can be partly explained by thefact that~2fxis always unity. Consequently, the standardized sums have adjusted themselves insuch away that they have produced the 1950 levelof Illegitimacy Rate and Ratio. Of course, the level ofillegitimacy, as indicated by the Rate and the general probability, has not changed much during this period.
Conclusion. Onthe whole, the influence of changes in thedemographic factors in Sweden were ascomplicated asinthe case of Norway. Thegeneral probability of illegitimacy, 2fxqJx, remained stable during 1900-20, dropped abruptly by 35% in 1930, and since then has fluctuated aroundthe level of 0.0075. Looking at the other angle, there were significant changes inthe levels of ix, since it was chosen as a factor of standardization infour out of six decades. The probability of remaining single remained unchanged during 1900-30, and dropped sharply during the next two decades. This wasthe main cause of the significant reduction in the Illegitimacy Ratio from the level of 160 in 1930 to around 100 during 1950-60.
Added tothis, the same pace of changes in the level of marital fertility (2/x(l -- qx)jx)

In this study, the term "level of illegitimacy" is explained as the probability of occurrence of an illegitimate birth to a specified female.

The Illegitimacy Ratio (number of illegitimate births per 1,000 total births) and the Illegitimacy Rate (number of illegitimate births per 1,000 unmarried females in childbearing ages) are two wellknown measures of the "level" of illegitimacy. We have presented the necessary mathematical expressions of these measures in terms of the four demographic factors and listed various properties of them. By our definition, the Illegitimacy Ratio does not
