The relative frequency of congenital malformations in various population groups has received considerable attention in recent years. The problems associated with comparing malformation rates in various groups are well recognized and have been discussed in depth by many authors (Neel, 1958; Stevenson et al., 1966; Morton et al., 1967; Kennedy, 1967; Lilienfeld, 1970). Despite the problems of comparability, a variety of hypotheses and models have been set forth which relate to the etiology of such malformations.
Comparison of malformation rates among races and of the effects of interracial crosses has been of particular interest in understanding the genetic basis of birth defects. Thus, in studies of Japanese infants, Neel (1958) observed that the total malformation rate was similar to those reported in other diverse populations, even though rates for specific malformations varied considerably. Subsequently, he proposed that a significant fraction of human congenital defects might be segregants from multilocal homeostatic systems. Morton et al. (1967) in a study of racial crosses in Hawaii obtained similar results in regard to total rate

of malformation among different races. However, their data showed no effect of outcrossing and "therefore no evidence that multiple homozygous 'phenodeviants' are of importance in the etiology of congenital defects" (p. 112). More recently, Carter (1970) suggested that the proposition that the total malformation rate is constant among racial groups may not be true.
The purpose of the present report is to document the overall malformation rate as well as frequencies of certain specific malformations in the American Indian. Since the American Indian is considered a migrant population long separated from its parental stock, comparison of these results with those available for other Mongoloid groups is of interest. A further objective of this paper is to examine the effects of admixture on the malformation frequencies from this population. A preliminary report of a part of these data has been published previously (Adams and Niswander, 1968).

Health Service hospitals were obtained for this study. The Indian Health Service operates a system of 51 hospitals. The inpatient capacities of these facilities range from 6 to 276 beds (Figure 1). All use an identical recording form which includes a newborn physical examination section completed by the attending physician. A discharge summary containing parental tribal affiliation, residence, and other vital statistics, along with a list of coded diagnoses and/or operative procedures relating to the infant was also available.
We estimate that approximately one-half of all American Indian births occur within the Indian Health Service (IHS) hospital system. More than 95 per cent of those families residing on federal reservations or within the 51 service unit areas utilize the IHS hospitals. The majority of those births for which we have no record represent families who have migrated to urban centers or areas not served by IHS. Many of these families do receive medical care under contract from local hospitals. However, because of the nommiformity in records and reporting systems and the difficulty in defining the base population served by such hospitals, no attempt was made to include this source of data.
The sample reported here represents a nearly complete ascertainment of Indian live births (95 per cent) on major federal reservations and therefore should contain no important ascertainment biases, such as preferential selection by choosing to utilize IHS facilities for delivery. The degree of representativeness of these data compared to that for nonreservation population is difficult to define.
VARIABLES REFLECTING OUTCOME OF PREGNANCY
During the period covered by this study, a total of 44,269 infant births was reported from IHS hospitals. These births are sum-

marized in Table 1. Newborn records were not routinely completed for stillborn infants. Because of the gross underreporting of stillborns and their importance in evaluating malformation frequencies, an attempt was made to supplement the hospital data. Thus, certificates of all recorded Indian fetal deaths occurring in Arizona between July, 1967, and July, 1969, were reviewed and tabulated.
The classification of malformations follows that used in a preliminary report (Adams and Niswander, 1968) and is in accordance with that of Neel (1958), Stevenson et al. (1966), Morton et al. (1967), and Woolf and Turner (1969). The designation of a major versus minor abnormality is arbitrary, but corresponds to these cited studies.
Since no information was available after discharge from the hospital, we have no method by which to assess neonatal deaths that occurred after hospitalization. Nevertheless, 398 liveborn infants died before discharge--usually within the first day of life. This group is referred to as "newborn deaths."
The data include 348 twin pairs and one

set of triplets. The twin data will be discussed in detail in another report (Morgan and Niswander, unpublished).
VARIABLES RELATING TO EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND GENETIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SAMPLE
The independent variables considered include a variety of indicators and measures of social, medical, demographic, and genetic factors with potential influence on pregnancy outcome. Specifically, we included sex of the infant, year of birth, maternal age, number of previous pregnancies, absence of prenatal care, legitimacy, maternal serology, nonhospital birth, residence (on and off reservation), and endogamy (parents of same or different linguistic group). If no information pertaining to the father appeared on the records, the birth was

considered illegitimate. Infants born outside of IHS hospitals, but admitted within 48 hours received regular newborn records.
The newborn record contains space for recording tribal affiliation of both mother and father. If the parents were of different tribes, the child was arbitrarily assigned to the father's tribe. Since 95 different tribal groups were encountered, it was necessary to classify tribes into more discrete groups. The tribes were grouped by major language families following classifications given by Hodge (1912), Swanton (1925), and Wissler (1938). Six specific language groups were delineated: Aleut-Eskimo, Athabascan, Algonquian, Iroquoi-Muskhogean, Hokan-Siouan, and Uto-Aztecan. These six groups encompassed over 90 per cent of the sample with "other" and non-Indians com-

prising the remainder. The original geographic distribution of these language groups was modified from Underhill (19S3) and is shown in Figure 2. The eight language groups were coded by use of seven "dummy" variables indicating deviations from the Uto-Aztecans (Uto-Aztecan, X i X7 = 0; Athabascan, Xi = 1, X2-X7 = 0; Aleut-Eskimo, Xx = 0, X2 = 1, X3-X7 = 0; etc.).
Information relating to non-Indian admixture was available from the newborn record as "degree of Indian blood" and was recorded as a fraction for each parent. For analytic purposes, the degree of Indian blood was coded in eights (0, non-Indian; 8, full blood) with the infant scored as the average of the parents. If the degree of

blood was recorded in finer fractions, it was arbitrarily rounded down to the nearest one-eighth. Since ABO and Rh blood types of the mother are included on the newborn record, it was possible to obtain an overall appraisal of the reliability of the stated degree of blood. For each mother's degreeof-blood category (0-8), frequencies of the B and r alleles were calculated. Assuming that both alleles are absent in pure Indians and that all intermixture was Caucasian, admixture estimates were calculated for each "blood" category using 0.074 and 0.387 as the respective Caucasian frequencies of B and r. A high degree of correlation was obtained between stated degree of blood and admixture estimates based upon blood typing (Figure 3). Although the

degree of blood clearly underestimates admixture, particularly at the lower levels, it does appear that degree of blood is a justifiable measure of intermixture.
In addition to the general descriptive data presented, we have employed stepwise regression to analyze total as well as selected specific malformation rates for effects of (1) linguistic groups, (2) medical-cultural variables, and (3) non-Indian intermixture. Our approach was first to test for differences between linguistic groups using the seven "dummy" variables (as previously mentioned). This procedure considers variation among groups in the regression model. After linguistic group variables were added, the various significant medical-cultural variables were added in stepwise fashion. The next step was to introduce the

child's degree of blood into the regression equation. If the effect of the child's admixture was not significant, the analysis was terminated. If the child's degree of blood was significant, we introduced the square of this term and tested for deviation from additivity; then as a separate procedure, we entered the mother's degree of blood to obtain information regarding maternal effects. This methodology results in a test of genetic admixture which is to an extent free of concomitant environmental variation.

Excluding multiple births, there were 43,526 infants recorded in the study. These births represent 33,755 different mothers and 8,874 sibships or half-sibships of two or more infants. A listing of the major malformations occurring within the same sibship is given in Table 3. In only seven cases

was there more than one affected child born to the same mother. Major genes are certainly indicated in the two instances of albinism and possibly for polydactly. The occurrence of this large number of sibs in the sample creates a potential problem for analysis. However, the very low recurrence rates involved suggest that such a factor will have very little effect on the overall results, and therefore it has not been considered in further analyses.
Among the 119 stillbirths reported, ten (8.14 per cent) were malformed. Since this small sample of stillbirths is likely to be biased with respect to malformation, we examined fetal death certificates for Indians reported in Arizona for the years under study. During this period, 20,559 Indian births were reported in Arizona with 247 (12.0/1,000) stillbirths recorded. Of these births, 11,466 occurred in IHS hospitals and 126 (10.6/1,000) were stillborn. A

listing of the sixteen (6.5 per cent) malformations recorded among these 247 infants is presented in Table 4.

Mean frequencies for specific malformations among different linguistic groups are given in Table 5. Results of regression analysis for various malformation categories and newborn death are given in Table 6. Although a number of statistically significant effects are noted, the J?2's are all quite low, indicating that, collectively, the variables studied have little predictive value with respect to the individual infant.

DISCUSSION
MAJOR MALFORMATIONS
The most striking aspect of these data with regard to total major malformation is the variation between the different linguistic groups. The observed frequencies range from 2.6 per cent in the Aleut-Eskimo group t o U per cent in the Uto Aztecans. These difference are highly significant

The two-fold differences which we observe between subgroups of Indians, a Mongoloid population, ascertained in a relatively homogeneous hospital system in a single study are difficult to reconcile with Neel's assertion of similar frequencies of

total malformations for Caucasian and Mongolian populations. The frequencies of specific malformations tend to vary between linguistic groups more or less independent of total malformation frequency. A notable exception is congenital heart disease 'which parallels total malformation frequency with respect to linguistic groups.
Major malformations were more frequent in males and increased in later births and among infants born outside the hospital. The effect of nonhospital births is most likely due to ascertainment bias in that a malformed infant born at home is more likely to be hospitalized than a normal child. No effect of admixture was detected.

MULTIPLE MALFORMATIONS
Multiple malformations, including those involving the same system, comprised 9.8 per cent of all malformed infants, while those involving different systems made up 7.1 per cent. This figure is in close agreement with other studies (e.g., Woolf and Turner, 1969; Neel, 1958; Chung and Myrianthopoulos, 1968). Significant positive effects were noted for later year of birth and advancing maternal age, but no effect of intermixture was found.
NEWBORN DEATH
As stated earlier, our classification of newborn death represents liveborn infants who survived for varying periods of time, but died before hospital discharge. I t cannot be equated with neonatal death as usually defined. Significant differences occurred among linguistic groups. The frequency of death increased with year of birth, birth order, and illegitimacy. There is a highly significant decrease in newborn death associated with the occurrence of prenatal care. This effect has been discussed in aprevious report (Iba et al., 1973) in which it was also found that birth weight

was lower when the mother did not receive prenatal care.
MINOR MALFORMATIONS
Differences regarding minor malformations were found among linguistic groups as well as by year of birth and legitimacy status. However, because of the variability in definition and reporting, these data are not considered reliable.

gest that our intermediate frequencies are the result of Caucasian admixture (Table 5). On the contrary, the highest rates occur among the Athabascans (Table 4) who tend to be among the least intermixed of the Indians in the United States. Based on B and r allele frequencies, the Athabascans show an average Caucasian admixture of 17 per cent, whereas all other groups collectively average 30 per cent admixture.

CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEFECTS
No significant effects were found in this category which is perhaps due to the relatively small numbers involved. Neel (19S8) has previously emphasized that relatively low frequencies of anencephaly and spina bifida appear to be characteristic of the Mongoloid race in general. Morton (1970) suggested that these low frequencies may in part be due to the low representation of stillbirths in the Mongoloid groups which have been studied. We have attempted to gain some additional information on this question by supplementing our present data with fetal death certificates for Indian births in Arizona for the years covered by our hospital records.
For the period from July, 1964, to June, 1969, there were 11,344 live births in IHS hospitals in Arizona and 122 fetal death certificates recorded for these hospitals. Among these 11,466 births, there were 14 cases of midline neurological malformations recorded: 11 cases with spina bifida, two with encephaloceles, and one with anencephaly, for a total frequency of 1.22/ 1,000. This frequency is similar to that among Japanese in Hawaii as reported by Morton (1970) and approximately four times higher that that reported by Miller (1964) for Indians in British Columbia. Nevertheless, the Indian frequency remains considerably lower than that for Caucasians after including the frequency in stillbirths. There is no evidence from our data to sug-

CLEFT LIP WITH OR WITHOUT CLEFT P A L A T E -- C 7 ( P )
As previously reported (Niswander and Adams, 1967), the frequency of C1(P) in American Indians is intermediate between that of Japanese and Caucasian--1.7/1,000 compared to 2.13 and 1.2/1,000, respectively. In this regard, we note that the only significant effect found in Table 5 for C1(P) is that of the child's degree of blood. There is no evidence of nonlinearity or maternal degree of blood. These findings are compatible with a high degree of genetic determination by multiple genes with additive effects and thus tend to support the multifactorial threshold model.
ISOLATED CLEFT PALATE
A significant positive relationship was found between CP and maternal age. This finding is in agreement with results reported by Hay (1967) who ako found a significant parental-age effect for C1(P). She also noted in her data that the parental-age effect was most pronounced for those clefts which occured in conjunction with other major malformations. The only other significant maternal age effect in our data is for the multiple malformation category.
DOWN'S SYNDROME
Significant effects were found for increasing birth order, nonhospital birth, and illegitimacy. The birth-order effect represents the well-documented effect in which the

frequency of Down's syndrome increases with increasing maternal age. Since maternal age and birth order are highly correlated and individually are both highly significant, it appears that birth order was entered first in the stepwise procedure, reducing the effect of maternal age to nonsignificance. Therefore, the significance of birth order rather than maternal age in Table 5 is probably of chance occurrence, reflecting this well-documented association of Down's syndrome with maternal age.
POLYDACTLY
A more detailed description of polydactly in these infants has been published elsewhere (Bingle and Niswander, 1974). The overall incidence of 2.4/1,000 is approximately twice that reported for Caucasians (Woolf and Woolf, 1970; Woolf and Myrianthopoulos, 1973). As shown in Table 5, there is significant effect of sex, with males being most frequently affected. Infants born outside the hospitals and later admitted were more frequently affected than those born in the hospital. This finding presumably reflects an ascertainment bias characterized by a tendency to seek medical consultation for an infant with a recognizable anomaly. We also found a significant positive effect of non-Indian admixture with a suggestion of a maternal effect. In view of the known genetic heterogeneity in polydactly, the interpretation of such a finding is unclear.
CLUBFOOT
The term "clubfoot" is imprecise and, as commonly employed, includes three etiologically distinct entities, namely, talipes equinovarus, metatarsus varus, and talipes calcaneovalgus, as well as a number of other less frequently occurring entities which are often poorly defined and may be relatively mild. Unfortunately, the newborn records did not always include a description adequate for precise classification, but an at-

tempt was made to limit the diagnosis of "clubfoot" to those entities which were either adequately described or appeared to represent definite abnormalities of a serious nature.
Among infants born in Hawaii, Morton et al. (1967) and Morton (1970) reported a higher frequency of clubfoot (primarily talipes equinovarus) in Caucasians than in Orientals. These findings were later confirmed by Ching et al. (1969). WynneDavies (1965) reported a total frequency in England of 4.04/1,000 for talipes equinovarus, metatarsus varus, and talipes calcaneovalgus. Our observed frequency of 1.8/1,000 among Indians in conjunction with the Hawaiian studies suggests that a low incidence of clubfoot is characteristic of Mongoloids in general. However, defintive conclusions are complicated by our inability to adequately subdivide our data by diagnostic categories.
Ching et al. (1969) found significant racial effects, which were predominantly additive, for talipes equinovarus but no racial variation in the incidence of metatarsus varus. Moreover, they found inconsistent racial effects for talipes calcaneovalgus which were interpreted as suggestive of nongenetic factors. We found no significant effects of any of the socio-environmental variables, which is consistent with their findings for talipes equinovarus; however, they did find a significant effect of maternal age on the incidence of metatarsus varus and an effect of father's occupation on talipes calcaneovalgus. Thus, while certain similarities exist between our results and those of previous studies, sound conclusions are hindered by the quality of our data.
CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE
Because of the uncertainty of the diagnosis in the neonate and the heterogeneity within this group of defects, our data are of very limited usefulness. For the present
