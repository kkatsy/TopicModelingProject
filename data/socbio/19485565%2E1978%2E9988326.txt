ABSTRACT: Chromosomally normal 46,XY males can have 47,XYY male offspring as a result of fertilization of a normal ovum by a YY spermatozoon, produced by nondisjunction in the second meiotic division or by mitotic nondisjunction of the Y chromosome in early stages of embryonic development of a 46,XY fetus. If such meiotic and mitotic nondisjunctions were random events and if these were the only source of 47,XYY males in the population, the incidence of 47,XYY males would remain constant. Two cases have been reported, however, in which 47,XYY males produced 47,XYY male offspring. If there are 47,XYY males who are a source of 47,XYY males in the population, there is the possibility that the incidence of 47,XYY males is changing. A discretegeneration model is presented which describes (1) the change in incidence of 47,XYY males from one generation to the next; (2) the incidence at equilibrium; and (3) the incidence as a function of the probability that a 47.XYY male has a 47,XYY offspring, and as a function of the mean number of offspring of 47,XYY males relative to the mean number of offspring of 46,XY males.

In considering the incidence of the 47,XYY male in the population, one generally assumes that the fathers of 47,XYY males are 46.XY males. Such 47,XYY males may result from fertilization of a normal ovum by a YY spermatozoon produced in gametogenesis by nondisjunction in the second meiotic division or may be produced by mitotic nondisjunction of the Y chromosome in early stages of embryonal development. If there were no systematic variation in the frequency of occurrence of the mechanisms by which 46,XY males produce 47,XYY male offspring, and if all 47,XYY males were the offspring of 46,XY males, the incidence of the 47.XYY karyotype would remain constant.
In contrast to cases of other sex chromosome variants in which sterility is the rule (e.g., 45,X and 47,XXY), instances have

been documented in which 47,XYY males have produced chromosomally normal offspring (e.g., Thompson etal., 1967) and 47,XYY males (Tzoneva-Maneva et al., 19661; Sundequist and Hellstrom, 19692). Viable YY spermatozoa could be produced in the 47,XYY male by primary nondisjunction in the second meiotic division as in the 46,XY male or by secondary nondisjunction. These cases of 47,XYY fatherson pairs provide evidence of a second source of 47,XYY males in the population and raise the possibility that the incidence of 47,XYY males is changing.
We now present a discrete-generation model which assumes that 46,XY males and 47,XYY males can produce 47,XYY male offspring and which describes (1) the change in the incidence of 47,XYY males

from one generation to the next; (2) the incidence at equilibrium; and (3) the incidence as a function of the probability that a 47,XYY male has a 47,XYY offspring, and as a function of the mean number of offspring of 47,XYY males relative to the mean number of offspring of 46,XY males. Since the model demonstrates the relationship between the incidence of 47,XYY males and reproductive characteristics of 46,XY males in comparison to reproductive characteristics of 47,XYY males, it delineates the kinds of data which would be required for a better understanding of the population aspects of the 47,XYY karyotype.

THE MODEL
We propose a discrete-generation model using standard modeling techniques. The assumption of nonoverlapping generations is commonly made in population genetics; it yields results which can be generalized to overlapping generations, but with a loss of clarity. The model describes: Ap, the change in the incidence of 47,XYY from one generation to the next;/), the incidence of 47,XYY males in the population at equilibrium; and y, the incidence of the production of 47,XYY males by 46,XY males. These parameters are defined as functions ofr, the probability of a 47,XYY male having a 47,XYY offspring, and of NJN2, the ratio of the mean total number of offspring of 47,XYY males reaching reproductive age to the mean total number of offspring of 46,XY males reaching reproductive age.

provided estimates for r and NJN2 are available. The estimation of p, the probable limits of r andiVj/iV2, and the characteristics of p as r and NJN2 vary are presented below.
ESTIMATION OF f>
The incidence of 47,XYY males is approximated by the prevalence of 47,XYY males in randomly selected or consecutive newborn males. Thirty-five 47,XYY males have been detected in six samples of newborn males totaling 37,634, resulting in a prevalence of 0.0009, or approximately 1 in 1,000 (Hook and Hamerton, 1977). If one assumes that differences in prevalence among the studies from different geographic areas reflect random rather than regional variation, the estimation of the incidence is based on a large sample size and should therefore be reasonably accurate.
ESTIMATION OF r
If the supernumerary Y chromosome of 47,XYY males segregated randomly and gametes were equally viable, the value of r could be determined on the basis of probability. The four types of expected gametes and the probability associated with each type would be: X (1/6), Y (1/3), XY (1/3), and YY (1/6). Accordingly, 1/6, or approximately 17 per cent, of the offspring could be expected to be 47,XYY males. Also, 47,XYY males would be expected to produce 47,XXY offspring and twice as many

chromosomally normal males as females. The research done on the presence of the supernumerary Y chromosome during gametogenesis in 47,XYY males has been reviewed by Hulten and Lindsten (1973). Several 47,XYY males studied had only normal XY bivalents. However, YY bivalents have been noted in the cells of two 47,XYY males and identified by fluorescence in one case. This finding confirms that, at least in some 47,XYY males, a supernumerary Y chromosome can be perpetuated throughout rather than being eliminated from the process of gametogenesis.
One method of estimating r is to determine what per cent of spermatozoa of 47,XYY males are YY-bearing. Diasio and Glass (1970) found S per cent YYbearing spermatozoa in 1,000 ejaculate spermatozoa of a 47,XYY male. In this subject, 70 per cent of the 1,000 spermatozoa contained one Y chromosome (or XY) in comparison to 36 to 49 per cent in spermatozoa of normal controls. Faedetal. (1976) found 1.6 per cent YY-bearing spermatozoa in 250 ejaculate spermatozoa of a 47,XYY male in contrast to 0.8 per cent of a normal control; Chandley et al. (1976) found 2.4 per cent in 1,600 spermatozoa of a 47,XYY male, and Hulten and Pearson (1971) found 2.9 per cent YY-bearing testicular spermatozoa.
In contrast to the studies of 47,XYY males, Diasio and Glass (1970) found no YY-bearing spermatozoa in spermatozoa of an unspecified number of 46,XY males; Sumner et al. (1971) found an average of 1.3 per cent of YY-bearing spermatozoa in 4,000 ejaculate spermatozoa of four subjects, three of whom were attending a subfertility clinic; and Pawlowitzki and Pearson (1972) found an average of 1.3 per cent in 10,692 ejaculate spermatozoa of twelve healthy fertile subjects. These studies suggest that the percentage of YY-bearing spermatozoa may be higher in 47,XYY

These YY-spermatozoa reported in 46,XY findings on randomly selected 47,XYY

males. YY-bearing spermatozoa may not be as viable as normal spermatozoa and/or the percentages reported may represent substantial overestimations due to technical problems in identifying YY-bearing spermatozoa. In either case, it is likely that the percentages of YY-bearing spermatozoa reported for 47,XYY males will be overestimations of r.

males constitute the only direct data on the viability of 47,XYY male infants and suggest a probability that a 47,XYY male will reach the age of reproduction which is roughly equivalent to the probability for 46.XY males.

of whom were found to have impaired spermatogenesis. Three of the four had reduced sperm counts resulting from the presence of tubules with spermatogenic arrest as manifested in testicular-biopsy specimens. The fourth 47,XYY male had tubules with complete spermatogenesis, but with a reduced number of spermatids. Although one of the 47,XYY males had a son, these data on 47.XYY males who were not detected in an institutionalized or fertility clinic population strongly suggest that the fertility of 47,XYY males may on the average be lower than that of 46,XY males.

number of offspring as a function of incarceration and subsequent lack of opportunity to reproduce.
In summary, there have been no direct studies of the viability or reproductivity of the 47,XYY male which would indicate that Nt/N2 differs from 1. The data on gametogenesis in 47,XYY males strongly suggest that NJN2 may be less than 1. However, since this parameter has not been systematically investigated, a rangeof values of NJN2 will be assumed in the discussion of the relationship o{N1/N2top and 7-

To our knowledge, no data have been published on the mean number of offspring of 47,XYY males in comparison to that of 46,XY control males. It may be significant that the prevalence of 47,XYY males in mental-penal institutions is elevated. The nature of the relationship between the elevated prevalence and the supernumerary chromosome is unclear (Hook, 1973); nevertheless, the possibility exists that 47.XYY males have a reduced mean
