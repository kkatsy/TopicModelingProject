Hypotheses put forward to explain the inheritance of schizophrenia include at least: (1) a one dominant gene, (2) a one recessive gene, (3) a two gene, and (4) a polygenic theory (see Rosenthal, 1970, for a summary). Uncertainties in the diagnosis and variability of expression of the disease lead to difficulties in attempting to decide among these hypotheses and have led many to consider schizophrenia as a heterogeneous disease. The main complicating factor seems, however, to be the existence of important environmental contributions whose presence is clearly documented, but whose nature remains largely uncertain.
The magnitude of environmental effects is such that disbelief or minimization of the role of inheritance in schizophrenia is not uncommon. Evidence in favor of a genetic component comes from two sources: (1) the concordance in monozygotic twins, which ranges from 14% to 79% in eleven different studies (see Rosenthal, 1970), but is practically always higher than that in dizygotic twins (ranging from 2% to 15%); and (2) by corroborating adoption studies of the progeny of a schizophrenia parent (Heston, 1966; Kety et al., 1968),

and a small number of MZ twins brought up apart. The evidence thus speaks in favor of an important genetic contribution; on the other hand, the relatively low concordance of MZ twins clearly points out that the role of environmental differences is also important. The relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors remains to be assessed.
In spite of a confusing situation, the test of genetic hypotheses may be useful, provided the importance of the environment is duly considered. We have been interested in retesting the two extreme hypotheses, the one gene and the polygenic models, using in both cases the threshold approach. One assumes that every genotype has a given expectation (i.e., mean) of liability to manifest the disease with a distribution of liability around the mean which is entirely of environmental origin. In either model, the environmental variation is assumed to be independent of the genotype; thus, we ignore genotype-environment interaction. Only those individuals whose liability, resulting from the joint effects of genetic and environmental factors, is above a certain threshold value will express the disease.

In the case of the polygenic model, the

schizophrenia by Gottesman and Shields (1967) using the approach of Falconer (1965). The same threshold approach can be applied to the single gene model (see Figure 2). A figure similar to Figure 1 is given by Motulsky (1970) to explain some congenital malformations on the basis of a single locus with multiple alleles. We have simplified the approach by using only two alleles with which there are already four parameters to be fitted to the data. These parameters are the environmental variance, e2, which is assumed to be the same for all genotypes and is responsible for the three normal distributions of Figure 2; the gene frequency, q; the position of the threshold on the scale of the trait, T; and the position of the heterozygote relative to that of two homozygotes, h'.
THE SINGLE GENE MODEL
We have chosen to use the data in Rosenthai (1970), taken from tables presented

seem, however, to alter substantially the means. Table 1 gives a simple statistical analysis of these data. The high heterogeneity of available studies is immediately apparent. Most x2 values between studies are significant, even though some x2 a r e underestimated by the use of the number of probands instead of the number of children.
In view of the significance of most heterogeneity x2, standard errors of the observed percentages were computed from the binomial values, multiplied times Vx2/df if X2 were significant. This corresponds to using an ordinary weighted standard error for cases of significant heterogeneity. This heterogeneity at once makes the analysis difficult and throws doubt on the possibility of using more exact methods of segregation analysis, without selecting from the body of data. Some sources of heterogeneity--the variation in severity of the disease and that of the diagnostic criteria employed by dif-

ferent authors--are clearly recognizable and are discussed by Rosenthal (1970) in some detail. In the tabulation of MZ and DZ twins, for instance, the outcome of studies is given by a low and a high figure, usually depending on the severity of the criterion employed. The same is true of the S X S data. We have therefore computed two means--one from the low values and one from the high values--whenever a choice of values is indicated in the tables by Rosenthal. The two figures are indicated by the subscripts I and h respectively.
Further uncertainties arise from the large and significant discrepancy between the frequency of schizophrenia in parents of schizophrenic offspring, ascertained through the offspring (P/O = 4.4%), and the frequency of the disorder in offspring of one schizophrenic parent (N X S = 12.8%). Many explanations have been offered in the

literature. We have used these two estimates, however, as low and high limits in Table 2, although clearly the explanation is likely to be different from that of low and high values in other cases. The expectations for the two types (P/O and N X S) are, under a one gene model, very close, and if anything that for N X S is smaller.
Still a third source of heterogeneity both within classes and between classes is the inclusion of some risk values that have not been age corrected and others that have been age corrected. In particular, the values for S X S computed for the Rosenthal table are not age corrected, while those for N X S are. Erlenmeyer-Kimling (1968) gives age corrected values for S X S which are higher and are included in Table 2 for comparison.
The high heterogeneity observed throws doubt on the usefulness in this case of the

posed is that the general incidence, computed on the basis of the parameter values, had to lie between 0.8 and 2%. The examples in Table 2 are not exhaustive, but are representative of many sets satisfying these criteria.
Without attempting a more precise fit, which may be a useless exercise for a variety of considerations already mentioned, the sets of parameters satisfying the imposed restrictions all indicate an essentially recessive gene: h', the expected liability of the heterozygote is less than the mean of the expected liability values for the two homozygous types. The gene frequency is around 10% or higher. The threshold is such that 50% or more of the homozygous recessives would manifest the disease. Table 3 gives

expected while those for DZ co-twins or sibs are smaller; (2) expected values for S X S lie between the age-corrected and non-age-corrected values; and (3) expected values for P/O-N X S are closer to the incidences ascertained through affected children. All these deviations are in agreement with a schizophrenic effect of a schizophrenic close relative, a factor not included in the model. One other possible factor is the greater similarity in environments of MZ twins.
It is interesting that Elston and Campbell (1970) have analyzed a model which, although formally different, can be considered equivalent to the above one. They also have four parameters, the gene frequency and a penetrance for each genotype, that

the penetrance of each genotype for each set of parameters and the proportions of all schizophrenics that would belong to each genotypic class. Schizophrenics would be mostly, but not entirely, homozygous recessives according to this model. In particular, between 13% and 25% of all schizophrenics would have the homozygous normal genotype and manifest the disease only because of environmental factors; they might be called phenocopies. Thus, a single-gene threshold model predicts a heterogeneous etiology for schizophrenia.
It may be noted that the differences between the data and the expectations seem consistent over the four sets: (1) observed values for MZ co-twins are larger than the

can be converted into the parameters used by us. Although they have used a smaller and selected body of data (by only one author), so that the data they use differ from ours, our conclusions are in agreement with theirs, and the estimates they obtain are not excessively different from ours.
Heritability can be computed for a set of parameter values by first calculating the genetic variance from the formula:
Vo - 2pq[h'2(l - 2pq) - 4h'q2
which is easily derived from the value scale used for h' and the genotypes given in Table 2. Heritability in the broad sense is then calculated as H = VO/(VO + e2). The

260

heritability estimates for the four sets of parameter values are 13.6%, 11.6%, 11.6%, and 15.0%.
Finally, a recessive gene is in agreement with a higher incidence in the progeny of consanguineous matings as observed in a few sets of data (see Rosenthal, 1970). It should be noted, however, that a recessive gene with such a high frequency is expected to show, even if fully penetrant, a rather modest increase in the frequency of consanguineous parentage.
Before considering the polygenic model, we should emphasize the simplifying assumptions in the single gene threshold model. We assumed the environmental variation to have the same variance for each genotype and to be normally distributed; we assumed only two alleles in HardyWeinberg equilibrium; we have considered only presence versus absence of schizophrenia. As will be discussed later, this latter simplification applies also to the polygenic model. These assumptions are useful in simplifying the treatment of the data, but are recognized as limiting the validity of the description thus obtained. It does not incorporate all potential variables, but at least considers those that are likely to be of greatest importance.
THE POLYGENIC MODEL
Even greater difficulties are encountered in attempting an exact fit of the polygenic model. As already mentioned, Gottesman and Shields (1967), who first used it in schizophrenia, employed the approach introduced by Falconer (1965) to explain diabetes and other diseases on a polygenic basis. This approach (see Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971) is highly approximate, and the suggestion by J. Edwards (1969) to employ tetrachoric correlation coefficients seems far more satisfactory. The latter is exact as long as the underlying distributions are normal. Edwards gave a graph for esti-

mating the tetrachoric correlations from observed data and also an empirical formula to approximate the values obtainable from the exact tetrachoric correlation. Heritabilities (or more precisely correlations) above 80%, in the range indicated by some of the most informative data in schizophrenia, are not given in Edwards's graph.
Rather than using the approximation, especially in this higher range, we have computed the true tetrachoric correlation from the series expansion originally employed by Everitt (1910). We find these correlations to be substantially higher than those obtainable by Edwards's empirical formula, which appears to be a valid and good approximation only within the range in which his graph was drawn (see also Mendell and Elston, 1971; Smith, 1970). From these correlations we have computed the heritabilities given in Table 4 from

various values of incidence in relatives given in Table 1. Because of the uncertainty of the source of the discrepancy between N X S, and P X O, these values were not used.
The tetrachoric correlation, r, is computed from the incidence in relatives versus that in the general population, respectively equal to b / ( b + c) and (b -f- c ) / N in the symmetric tetrachoric ( = 2 X 2) table shown in Figure 3.

It is then divided by the genetic correlation, p, expected for the same type of relationship, to obtain the heritability. For MZ twins, p is 1 (i.e., the heritability is equal to the tetrachoric correlation). For DZ twins, one has to make further assumptions on dominance. Assuming no dominance, P = Y2, and the heritability is twice the tetrachoric correlation. Values obtained are given in Table 3, assuming, as Gottesman and Shields (1967) did, two possible levels of incidence of schizophrenia in the general population.
The heritabilities obtained do not differ much in the two sets of data. If the higher incidence figures are correct, this fact may reflect greater differences in environment of DZ twins than of MZ twins. Further tests of agreement can be made for the other crosses. In particular, S X S seems interesting, but the computation of expectations in this or other crosses, under the polygenic model, raises new computational problems. We have used in this case a Monte Carlo approach which is described in detail elsewhere (Cavalli-Sforza and Kidd, 1972). The outcome of the computations is given in Table 5.
The incidence observed in S X S matings seems somewhat lower than expected, suggesting a heritability below 80%, while data in Table 4 suggest a higher heritability. This difference is not large and may be mostly due to the simplicity of our simulation. We make no allowance for correlations

between environment and genotype or for interactions between the two. Matthysse and Shortliffe (1972) have considered two possible explanations: assortative mating among schizophrenics and a positive correlation between the total liability (environmental and genetic) of the parents and the environmental contribution to the liability of the offspring. They have shown that including such factors in the simulation results in much better agreement with the observed levels of incidence. Thus, it would seem that a polygenic model also cannot be ruled out.

DISCUSSION
The sources of heterogeneity discussed make it unlikely, but not impossible, that more precise methods of segregation analysis, employing individual family data, may reach more substantial conclusions. At any

262

rate, it seems difficult on the basis of the present analysis to discard either the one gene model or the polygenic model or both. We are thus in agreement with the supporters of either theory. Elston and Campbell (1970) did not fit a two-gene version of their model to the data, but we think that a two-gene threshold model could fit the data. In fact, since either extreme version, single gene or polygene, can account for the observed data, it seems intuitively likely that any intermediate version, in particular, the two-gene model, would also give a satisfactory fit to the present data. The same can be said for any model of genetic heterogeneity, since an increase in the number of parameters can only improve the fit.
Both of these threshold models, single gene and polygene, consider schizophrenia as an all or nothing disease; this is a great oversimplification. Heston (1970) has considered the possibility that there is essentially a continuum from normal to schizophrenic. There is, in addition, a gradient in severity among schizophrenics, and the concordance rate among twins has been shown to be positively correlated with the severity of the index cases (see Gottesman and Shields, 1967; Rosenthal, 1970). However, both models are based on an underlying continuous variable. Thus, there is no conceptual difficulty involved in subdividing this continuum into many segments corresponding to the types and degrees of severity in a schizoid spectrum, but the quality of the data do not seem to warrant the estimation of many separate thresholds at this time.
The correlation between concordance and severity has been used to support the polygenic model (Gottesman and Shields, 1967), but, in itself, it cannot discriminate between the two threshold models. Elston and Campbell (1970), relying on the large environmental effect, suggested the shared environment of twins was a plausible explanation. For threshold models, as here for-

mulated, it is not necessary to invoke environmental correlations to account for this observation. It is only necessary to postulate that the more severely affected individuals are higher on the liability scale to see that, by either model, these individuals thereby have a higher probability of being schizophrenic because of a schizophrenic genotype than the more mildly affected individuals. Concordance rates would thus be correlated with severity on either model.
The severity-concordance correlation already mentioned points out a possibly significant source of heterogeneity among studies. Thus, twin studies based on resident hospital patients have higher concordance rates than those based on general population surveys (Rosenthal, 1961; Gottesman and Shields, 1966). Future work on the single gene model presented here should include an attempt to fit the data separately for each type of study, thereby eliminating this source of heterogeneity. Should we find that only the threshold need be varied to account for the differences between the types of studies, it would be strong support for the threshold model but would not necessarily favor the single gene or polygenic versions.
There are three other considerations which emerge from this analysis which may be worth further comment. The first is that, if we cannot at this stage discard either a one gene hypothesis or a polygenic hypothesis, the former is more attractive, both because it is favored from the application of Occam's razor and also because it gives more hope of resolution in simple biochemical terms. Eventually, the answer to such complex cases of inheritance will be in the hands of biochemical researchers. Whichever the answer, it is more gratifying at this stage to think that there is no real evidence yet, against the hope that the answer may be relatively simple (i.e., that there is one major locus, though greatly complicated by

environmental effects). If the data force us to accept a truly polygenic hypothesis, the explanation in physiological or biochemical terms is unlikely to be as simple. Naturally, a great number of alternatives to the simple one-recessive-allele or the simple polygenic hypothesis remain available. The multiplication of parameters would improve thefit, but the acceptability of any of these more complex hypotheses would remain, at the moment, scarcely greater than that of any other explanation.
Another consideration refers to thevalues of heritability thus computed. The same set of data analyzed as a polygenic system yields a heritability of 80% or higher, but as a one gene system, it yields values that vary from 10% to 15%. Thus, on one hypothesis, the role of genetics (as denned by the heritability concept) is more important. The two theories fit almost equally well--or equally poorly--the data, but well enough that both theories have been accepted by competent, though different, research workers. Should one attach much meaning to a quantity such as heritability which may fluctuate so widely depending on the genetic hypotheses employed, and among which, at this stage, it seems to be difficult to make a firm choice?

SUMMARY
Data on the inheritance of schizophrenia indicate that both genetics and environment contribute in an important wayto the manifestation of the disease. However, heterogeneity of thedata makes an accurate analysis very difficult. For this reason, the solution is unlikely to come from statistical techniques alone. Future advances in physiological, toxicological, and biochemical research are more likely to supply a firmer basis to the understanding of the genetic component of this disorder. A crude analysis of a threshold model, using a polygenic or a single gene hypothesis, shows that both are in approximate agreement with the data.
Though argument about genetic models seems futile when virtually any model can account for the data, the single gene hypothesis is unavoidably more attractive at this stage. If a single gene is involved, the allele predisposing toward schizophrenia should be considered as essentially, though not entirely, recessive; all genotypes would be strongly affected by unknown environmental factors; and even some genetically normal individuals would manifest the disorder.

Finally, it maybe mentioned that if the one gene hypothesis is correct, then thegene predisposing toward schizophrenia should be considered an essentially recessive gene of relatively high frequency (of theorder of 10% or higher) although there may be some affected persons who are of the heterozygote type, and some of the homozygotes for it may be normal. Schizophrenics would be in fact of all possible genotypes, though predominantly (about 70%) of the homozygous recessive type.

In the case of schizophrenia, the restriction thus imposed limits therange of possible solutions to gene frequencies between approximately 0.06 and 0.15. In this range all solutions are equally acceptable. Thus, a single gene two allele model can fit the data. If a single locus is involved, the gene frequency must be in the neighborhood of q = 0.10 (with range 0.06-0.15 by James' approach). A very similar range of solutions was found with our
