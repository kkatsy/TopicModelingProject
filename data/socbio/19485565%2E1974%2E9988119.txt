Marital Distances and Inbreeding in Porto Alegre, Brazil

Inbreeding coefficients have been calculated for a large number of populations (reviews in Freire-Maia, 1957, 1968; Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971). Another measure of population structure is the distance which separates the spouses' birthplaces (marital distance). Much less is known about its distribution in different human groups (see, for instance, Morton, 1964; Krieger, 1966; Azevedo et al., 1969; Yasuda, 1969; Coimbra et al., 1971, for researches in Brazilian populations; Imaizumi and Furusho, 1972, and Lasker et al., 1972, for studies in Japan and Italy, respectively).
The relationship between these two parameters, as well as between them and other estimates of population migration, is not well established. Bresler (1970) observed a curious effect of greater fetal loss as the distances between birthplaces of mates increased. On the other hand, Wolañski et al. (1969, 1970) found a positive correlation between the stature, chest circumference, and Quetelet's index of 1,896 Polish children with the increasing distances in the places of birth of their parents.
Our paper furnishes data on marital dis-

tances and inbreeding coefficients from samples of the White and Black populations of Porto Alegre, Brazil; the relation between these variables was studied and the effect of marital distances on prenatal mortality and newborn morbidity investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The present work was done as part of a general long-term plan of study of the population of Porto Alegre, Brazil. The collection of information was made at two maternity hospitals. The data from Hospital Presidente Vargas was collected from January, 1965, to October, 1969; and data from Hospital Ernesto Dornelles, from March, 1968, to June, 1970. Each hospital was visited at least three times a week. Information about the newborn was collected from the maternity records, supplemented when necessary by personal examination and discussions with the physician in charge.
Afterwards, an interview with the mother was arranged, to obtain some additional data about herself and her husband. These included their past reproductive performance, their places of birth and those of

their parents, plus their biological relationship.
The estimation of marital distances was made using appropriate maps. When the members of a couple were born in Brazil, the computation used the mileage between the two points by way of the most common roads. For computation involving locations in a foreign country, a straight-line distance was used. The calculation of the inbreeding coefficient was made after a careful questioning of the mother; when she was biologically related to her husband, a simplified pedigree was drawn to ascertain in a precise way their degree of relatedness.
All data were coded, transferred to punched cards, and analyzed in the university's 1130 IBM electronic computer.
RESULTS
Table 1 and Figure 1 present the distribution of marital distances of couples from this and the past generation, subdivided according to race. All the distributions showed a marked leptokurtosis, similar to that observed in other series. As can be seen, in the present generation irrespective of race the marital distances of 26 per cent of the couples were equal to or less than 10 km. The frequency of this class increases from two to three times when we consider the wife's or husband's parents. Despite the general similarity between the distributions of Whites and Blacks, they are significantly different in the two generations considered; the dissimilarity is mainly due to long-range migration. Differences also appear when we compare within each race the data from the wife's and husband's parents.
The average and median marital distances observed in Porto Alegre are compared in Table 2 with the averages found in another Brazilian city, Belém, the capital of the state of Para. Considering Bra-

The medians of the marriages contracted in the past generation are extremely low in Porto Alegre. The Belém averages without foreigners are of the same order of magnitude as those observed in Porto Alegre; but since European immigrants to Brazil settled mainly in the south during the last century, the Porto Alegre

of the true migration. This mixed approach was followed in our analysis.
The average marital distances reported for Porto Alegre are relatively large especially when we consider all marriages (involving Brazilians and foreigners). Lower values were observed in Switzerland (Morton et al., 1968), three Japanese communities (Imaizumi and Furusho, 1972) and two Alpine Italian populations (Lasker et

al., 1972). As for comparisons within Brazil, the Porto Alegre and Belém data agree reasonably well, showing much more migration than that encountered by Krieger (1966) in the northeast (averages of 86.9 and S3.2 km. for the present and past generation respectively).
The differences which we observed in the results from the wife's and husband's parents may be due to our method of obtaining this information. Since the latter was collected through the wife, there is a possibility that she would know more easily the distances of her husband's parents when they were short than when they were long.
Our findings do not support those of Bresler (1970); the incidence of prenatal mortality was not greater at larger marital distances, neither could we detect any effect in the prevalence of malformed infants. Ethnic differences, with the exception of the distance distribution, were also negligible in our material.
The low inbreeding rates observed in Porto Alegre are similar to those found

in other southern Brazilian populations (Freire-Maia, 1957; Fonseca and FreireMaia, 1970). The negative relationship observed between F and marital distance was also found by Yasuda (1969) in northeastern Brazil.
SUMMARY
A total of 4,491 White and 951 Black couples ascertained a t the birth of one of their children was studied in relation to marital distances and inbreeding. Estimates of the first parameter are relatively large and differ among the indicated ethnic groups mainly because of long-range migration. No effect of marital distance on prenatal mortality and newborn morbidity was observed. The inbreeding rates arelow

and of the same magnitude in Whites and
Blacks. They show a significant negative
correlation with marital distance.
