Spontaneous abortion has been shown to be associated with both ABO incompatibility (Takano and Miller, 1972; Britisk Medical Journal, 1972) and placental alkaline phosphatase (PI) genotype (G. Beckman et al., 1972).
Data collected by our group during the past five years (Bottini et al. 1972a; 1972b; 1972c) have shown a complex interaction between the polymorphism of placental alkaline phosphatase and that of the ABO system. This interaction, confirmed at the population level by Ananthakrishnan et al. (1974), suggests a cooperative role of ABO and PI factors in the maintenance of the fertilized ovum in utero.
I t is likely, however, that spontaneous abortion represents only a facet of a process of selection which starts early in intrauterine life and continues later on with abortion and neonatal jaundice (Mourant, 1972). Moreover, since it is known that two other factors, Rh and haptoglobin (Hp), interact with ABO during intrauterine life (Levine, 1959," Cohen, 1970; Ritter and Hinkelniann, 1966; Kirk et a l , 1970) and that Hp interacts with PI (Ananthakrishnan et al.,

1974), at least four polymorphic systems may intervene simultaneously in this process.
In this report, an outline of our observations on ABO and PI interactions is presented, and some hypotheses are suggested on the possible role played by placental alkaline phosphatase and ABO blood groups in the maternal-fetal relationship.
THE INTERACTION BETWEEN A B O
AND P L POLYMORPHISMS
Placental alkaline phosphatase is a polymorphic glycoprotein normally produced only during fetal life. Its synthesis is controlled by an autosomal locus with three common codominant alleles (Plf*, Pl3i, and Pl!i). Correspondingly, there are six common electrophoretic phenotypes (S,F, I,SF,SI and F I ) . The enzyme, produced by the fetal part of the placenta, appears early in gestation in the maternal circulation where it persists for several weeks after delivery (Boyer, 1961; Robson and Harris, 1965; Robson and Harris, 1967; Sussman et al., 1968). The enzymatic activities associated with the three common alleles Plfi, Pl*i, and PI1!, are in

the following ratio (placental extracts): 0.90:0.81:0.33.
The observations indicating an interaction between PI and ABO polymorphisms are derived from a study carried out on newborn infants from various populations living in New Haven, Connecticut. Sampling and biochemical methods are described in a previous paper (Bottini et al., 1972c). The most relevant data obtained by our group up to now are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
The data in Table 1 show an association between PI and ABO system phenotypes; the pattern of this association is influenced by the presence of feto-maternal blood group incompatibility (in the ABO and/or Rh system). The distribution of PI alleles and phenotypes in newborn infants compatible with their mothers in

both systems (ABO and Rh) depends upon the fetal ABO phenotype. Newborns with blood group B show a proportion of phenotypes carriers of allele Pl'i which is significantly lower than expected. The pattern is different in newborn infants incompatible with their mothers in the ABO and/or Rh system. In this group, the proportion of phenotype carriers of allele Pl'i in infants with blood group B is significantly higher than in infants compatible with their mothers. These findings are more apparent in first-born infants.
The analysis of the incidence of fetomaternal isoimmunization in infants incompatible with their mothers in the ABO system, in relation to the PI phenotype (Table 2), has shown that in newborn infants incompatible in the B group the signs of isoimmunization (i.e., a positive

direct Coombs test and/or jaundice) are less frequent in infants who are carriers of allele Pl'i.
Further evidence in favor of an interaction between the ABO and PI polymorphisms was obtained by our group from the analysis of the correlations between the PI and ABO system gene frequencies in 19 different human populations. This analysis has shown a negative correlation between I B and Pl'i gene frequencies (Bottini et al., 1912a) which is in agreement with the observations in the newborn population.
The data on compatible subjects, reported in Table 1 suggest a heterogeneity of the interaction between ABO and PI polymorphisms among different populations. Indeed, the distortion of phenotype distribution seems very strong in Negroes, in which the frequency of Plfi is very low, and relatively weak in Jews in which the frequency of Pl'i is very high (Bottini et al., 1972a). It is interesting that a heterogeneity of the relationship between the frequency of spontaneous abortion and the presence of Plsi factor has been observed by L. Beckman et al. (1969; 1972).
As previously discussed (Bottini et al., 1972c), the most likely interpretation of our results is that of an interaction between the PI and ABO polymorphisms with strong selective effects. The presence

of the Pl'i allele, which is associated with the highest enzymatic activity, is advantageous for B-group individuals incompatible with the mother in the ABO system. On the other hand, in the absence of blood group incompatibility, the B-group subjects carrying allele Pl'i are at a disadvantage. Since our data were obtained from a newborn population, they should reflect a selection operating during intrauterine life; the lethal effects of this selection should produce significant distortions in the phenotype distribution. However, in subjects with ABO incompatibility, these selective forces also continue to operate during extrauterine life with significant effects on PI and ABO phenotypes. Therefore, although an interaction between PI and ABO is present both in compatible and incompatible subjects, the pattern observed in incompatible infants is symmetric with that observed in the compatible ones.
From our observations, an excess of Pl'i in spontaneous abortions might be expected. In fact, this excess has been reported by G. Beckman et al. (1972).
HYPOTHESIS ON THE ROLE OF A B O BLOOD GROUPS AND PLACENTAL ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE IN THE MATERNAL-FETAL RELATIONSHIP
Our data are consistent with the suggestion of Robson and Harris (1965) that

224

the PI polymorphism may play a role in the maternal-fetal interactions. More specifically, it is possible that placental alkaline phosphatase has some function in blastocyst implantation and/or the maintenance of the fetus in utero. Actually, the striking deficiency of the Plf* allele in subjects of group B, observed in compatible infants, suggests a role of both PI and ABO factors in the implantation and/or in the maintenance of the developing embryo in utero.
L. Beckman (1968) has suggested that the release of glycoproteins from the cell is related to the ABO genotype. On the basis of this theory, it is possible that the pattern of variability of enzymatic activity and/or of some cellular structure dependent upon the PI polymorphism is different among ABO genotypes. In this way, the ABO system could indirectly regulate some function of placental alkaline phosphatase.
The action of the PI factor may be immunological in nature. This hypothesis is supported by two circumstances: (1) The pattern of Pl-ABO interaction is less clear in the pregnancies following the first. This finding is consistent with the experimental evidence suggesting that the immunological response of the mother to her partner's antigens may undergo significant changes with subsequent pregnancies (Breyere and Barret, 1961). (2) The pattern of Pl-ABO interaction is dependent on the maternalfetal incompatibility status in the ABO system, showing a drastic change when considering compatible babies vs. incompatible ones.
SITES AND MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF PLACENTAL ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE
The function of placental alkaline phosphatase could take place through a physicochemical interaction with fetal antigens and/or through an action on the maternal immunocompetent system. In this respect,

the action of PI alleles could be related with the corresponding enzymatic activity; it could also be dependent upon the amount of glycoprotein as a structural component of the trophoblast membrane.
The action of PAP could take place (1) in the layer of trophoblast cells that separates maternal from fetal tissues and/or (2) in the maternal organism.
Possible action in the trophoblast.-- According to some views, the sialomucin (glycocalyx) which covers the trophoblast cells may have important functions in the maternal-fetal interaction (Billington, 1969; Simmons, 1969; Kirby, 1969; Currie, 1968; Curzen, 1970; Currie, 1970; Wynn, 1971; Beer and Billingham, 1971). It has been suggested that this layer masks antigens on the trophoblast membrane, thereby contributing to the immunological isolation of the conceptus.
On the other hand, an incomplete masking of the antigenic structures of the trophoblast membrane could be advantageous for several reasons. Implantation is associated with local inflammatory reaction (Beer and Billingham, 1971). Fetuses unlike their mothers may have increased chance of survival (Clarke and Kirby, 1966), and genetical dissimilarity with the mother seems to favor the implantation of the blastocyst (Kirby, 1970). It has also been suggested that ABOcompatible male blastocysts could implant more successfully than females owing to differences with their mothers in Y-linked antigens. This suggestion is in part supported by data on the sex ratio (Kirby, 1970). Placental "enhancement" may be a contributing factor in the maintenance of the developing embryo in utero (Beer and Billingham, 1971).
It is possible that the variability--for example, on a genetic basis--of some structural property of the sialomucin coat of

Vol. 22, No. 3 Abortion: ABO System and P I Genotype

the trophoblast could affect the implantation of the blastocyst and the maintenance in utero of the fetus. A heuristic scheme may be as follows. An excess of mucopolysaccharide increases the immunological isolation of the fetus and therefore is advantageous in the ^presence of maternal-fetal blood group incompatibility. On the other hand, an excessive "masking" effect on fetal antigens impairs some maternal reactions which may be very important for blastocyst implantation and/or for the maintenance of the fetus in utero.
The trophoblast membrane is very rich in alkaline phosphatase (Wachstein et al., 1963) and placental alkaline phosphatase has a very high content of sialic acid (Robson and Harris, 1967). These two observations suggest that placental alkaline phosphatase may contribute to the biochemical constitution of the sialomudn coat of the trophoblast and could therefore be responsible for a structural and functional variability of this pericellular layer.
Possible action in the maternal organism.--The enzyme present in the maternal circulation could act on the maternal immunocompetent cells, interfering with their response to fetal antigens. It is also possible that the enzyme interacts with fetal antigens, thereby changing their antigenic properties. Finally, the circulating enzyme could block already formed maternal antibodies.
Women with rheumatoid arthritis often show a clinical remission of the disease during pregnancy (Beer and Billingham, 1971; Persellin et al., 1971), and it has been suggested that subsidence of inflammation could be due to a serum component which stabilizes leucocyte lysosomes (Persellin et al., 1971).
Some glycoproteins can inhibit the lym-

phocyte response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Besides an alphaglobulin present in adult serum (Cooperband et al., 1969), a placental glycoprotein fraction and some preparations of human chorionic gonadotropin also possess this property (Riggio et al., 1971; Adcock et al., 1973). Moreover, during pregnancy, both a reduction in maternal lymphocyte response to PHA and a depressant action of plasma on normal lymphocytes stimulated by PHA have been reported (Leikin, 1971; Purtilo et al., 1972; Hill et al., 1973; Yu et al., 1975). A high rosette inhibition titre in pregnant mice has been also reported (Morton et al., 1974).
If PAP has a role in depressing the maternal lymphocyte responsivity during pregnancy, the intensity of such depression should be a function of both PI and ABO types of the fetus. In particular, the lowest degree of responsivity should be found in mothers pregnant with a B fetus carrying the Pl'i factor.
Since PAP and HCG are glycoproteins produced by the trophoblast cells and both are poured in the maternal circulation, it is also conceivable that PI and ABO factors may exert their effects through interactions with the release of HCG, the latter being the active substance.
SEX RATIO OF COMPATIBLE NEWBORNS OF GROUP B
An important point in the hypothesis presented in this paper is the assumption that the ABO genotype influences some structural and functional expressions of PI polymorphism which are relevant in the maternal-fetal relationship. In general, carriers of B factor may show a better immunological isolation and/or a lower responsivity of maternal lymphocytes. Assuming that blastocysts carrying chromosome Y are on the average more antigenically dissimilar from their mothers than XX bias-
