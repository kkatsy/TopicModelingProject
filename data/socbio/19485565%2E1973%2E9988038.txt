I t has been widely observed that the frequencies of fetal and neonatal deaths, congenital malformations, premature births, and maternal complications each differ with the age at which pregnancy occurs and the order of births. This is the first of a series of papers in which the attempt is made to determine the extent to which the observed differences in rates of occurrence of problems associated with pregnancy are caused by differences in age of the mothers and the degree to which age-specific rates merely reflect causal factors which are unrelated to aging. The initial focus is on stillbirth or late fetal death.
Marked differences in stillbirth ratio with age of mother are obvious upon inspection of vital data. I t is commonly assumed that these differences reflect changes in the risk of stillbirth to individual women as they age. Thus, Chase (1967) asserts that maternal age is selectively associated with fetal mortality and therefore the age distribution of women giving birth affects the mortality rate observed in a population. For this reason, before comparing stillbirth

ratios in the United States to other countries, she adjusted those ratios to the levels which would obtain if the age distributions at birth were identical. DeHaas-Posthuma and de Haas (1968) chose to adjust the Dutch stillbirth ratio actually recorded in 1962-63 to the ratio which would have been recorded had the age distribution been the same as that which occurred in 1952--53 before comparing ratios in those years. These and other authors routinely recognize that age and birth-order effects, if present, are confounded in the vital data.
Tabah and Sutter (1948) attempted to disentangle these effects and to test the reality of each separately. They concluded that all apparent increases in stillbirth ratios with increasing birth order were artifactual and resulted from the real increase in risk with increasing age. Such a conclusion forms the basis for alarm if individual women decide to delay their pregnancies. Other attempts to estimate age and birthorder effects typically conclude that both are real and that there are in addition nonadditive effects resulting from interactions between age and birth order as causal factors (e.g., Fischler, Peritz and Wingerd,

1971). However, these analyses all rest on the assumption that women who bear a child at one age and parity are on the average similar (except for age and parity) to those bearing a child at a different age and parity. But women of differing socioeconomic status have different risks of stillbirth at all ages and parities (Heady et al., 195S; Kincaid, 1965; Butler and Alberman, 1969) and are not distributed similarly among the age and parity classes. It is doubtful that the average woman who has her first recorded birth at age 40 -was twenty years earlier physiologically comparable to the members of her cohort who were bearing their first child at the age of twenty.
If we are to predict the consequences of decisions of individual women to bear their children at different ages, we must attempt to analyze the association of stillbirth ratio with age in a manner that permits estimates of the part of that association which is the result of changes in individual women as they age and that part which is the result of unequal representation among age classes of women who inherently have a high risk of fetal loss. The present study applies the idea presented by Illsley (1967) that each combination of age and parity has its own composition in terms of social and biological characteristics and that the pregnancy outcome which is experienced results both from effects of aging and parity and from effects which are attributable to the social and biological composition of the group. Prominent among the social factors should be the tendency of both the youngest mothers and the grand multiparae to come from lower social groups and to be generally less healthy. Among the expected biological factors would be the overrepresentation of chronic aborters at low parity with advanced age.
James (1968) has concluded that the increasing stillbirth ratio with increasing birth rank after the minimum at second

birth is not primarily due to secular changes within individual women, but to the overrepresentation at higher birth order of women who had been stillbirth prone at all times. Because any rapidly rising risk with increasing age of individual women should have produced a finding of increased risk at higher birth orders, his analysis provides grounds for doubting that there is such an age effect.
The present paper develops an attempt to estimate effects of changing patterns of childbearing on age and birth order specific stillbirth ratios from analysis of published vital data. Work in progress attempts to estimate changes in risk to individual women as they age based on the analysis of pregnancy outcome of the same women at different ages.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE
HYPOTHESIS
Attempts to compare stillbirth ratios among nations are complicated by varying definitions. Many countries follow the convention of the United Nations and define a late fetal death as one whose gestation period has been at least 28 weeks. The United States, however, includes gestations as short as 20 weeks. France chooses to report only legitimate births. Regardless of the convention adopted, the completeness of reporting is highly variable and generally not precisely known. In this paper some of the problems are reduced by using a relative stillbirth ratio which is obtained by dividing the reported ratio for the age or age parity group by the ratio for all recorded births in the country.
It has been traditional to estimate the changing risk of stillbirth as individual women age from Table 1. Thus, we can estimate that a woman in the United States who might have borne a child at age 22 is subject to a 57.5% increase in the probability of late fetal death if she decides to

defer that pregnancy until age 32. Fundamental to this estimate is the assumption that stillbirth ratios calculated for the age groups from vital data reflect physiological changes occurring with age ·within individual Wmen. Comparison of the age changes in ratios between Canada and the United States reveals a strongly similar pattern. The minimum stillbirth ratio occurs in the early twenties. Before that, women are presumed not to have reached their physiological optimum for childbearing and after that are presumed progressively to deteriorate.
Examination of the patterns in England and Wales, France, and Ireland reveals both similarities and differences. The minimum loss rate is again found in age 20-24. The rate of deterioration with advancing age is, however, notably slower. On the other hand, the reproductive performance of the under20 group tends to be worse than in the United States, especially in Ireland. Japan

provides a greater contrast. The age of minimum loss is shifted to the late twenties, while loss rates are very high for young mothers, and the rate of apparent deterioration after 35 is very steep. While these contrasts among countries might reflect basic differences in physiological changes with age, we may reasonably suspect that a major part of the difference is caused by cultural dissimilarities.
One pertinent cultural factor is displayed in Table 2. Within each country, age groups which account for large fractions of the births have low stillbirth ratios while age groups with few births have a high loss rate. Japan, which has the highest stillbirth ratio under 20, has the fewest births in that group. Japan alone has the minimum loss rate in the late twenties, and Japan alone has an intense concentration of births in those years. The inverse relationship between stillbirth ratios and the concentration of births by age group suggests that we

should look upon each country's population as composed of two classes of women: stillbirth-prone women who exercise relatively little control over the timing or numbers of their births and stillbirth-resistant women who constitute the substantial majority and who exercise more control over the ages of occurrence of their births.
The stillbirth-prone women are postulated to be primarily of two distinct groups, both of which should be disproportionately represented among the older birth-age groups. Women of low socioeconomic status have elevated stillbirth ratios at all ages and birth orders. Their births will appear widely scattered among the age groups, but will be a minority of births in the twenties and early thirties when the majority of all births occur. In the older groups, progressively larger fractions of the births recorded will be in this stillbirth-prone class because they have larger families on average and tend to bear them over a broader span of years than is typical for the society of which they are a part. They will be overrepresented in the older groups and will elevate those stillbirth ratios. They will also be disproportionately represented among exceptionally young mothers and high parities for all age groups.
Other women are postulated to be high stillbirth risks for physiological reasons which prevent them from reaching high parity at any age. This should include a subgroup of women whose basic defect is genetic. These are women who have difficulty conceiving, have many spontaneous abortions, and are also susceptible to late fetal loss. Among the lower age groups, their births will be a small fraction of those reported. Among the higher ages, their births will be a progressively greater fraction of those recorded at the lower birth orders, especially as first births. Thus, both groups will contribute to the inflation of stillbirth ratios calculated for older women, one group at low and the other at high

parity. Only the low socioeconomic status group should inflate the stillbirth ratios among the young mothers.
A specific example of a maternal condition which contributes to the class of physiologically stillbirth prone women is the "Incompetent Internal Os" (Armenia, 1963). Without specific treatment, these women lose nearly 100% of their pregnancies. Some losses occur too early in gestation to be registered as fetal deaths. A smaller fraction of these losses would be registered in countries which provide for a longer gestation period before registration is required. With medical treatment, many pregnancies are carried through to live births, but the loss rate remains very great.
TEST OF THE HYPOTHESIS
One prediction of the hypothesis is that the stillbirth ratio in a particular age class should decline if it becomes more fashionable to bear children at that age. In order to avoid the confounding of birth-order effects with age effects, each combination of mother's age and birth order will be treated separately. The prediction thus becomes: The stillbirth ratio for an age-birth order class should decline if it becomes more fashionable to bear children in that category.
The stillbirth ratio which will be used is the relative stillbirth ratio defined as the stillbirth ratio for the age-birth-order class (number of late fetal deaths/number of late fetal deaths plus number of live births) divided by the total stillbirth ratio for that nation for the year. Overall stillbirth ratios have dropped substantially over the period of time considered, presumably because of improved health and health care. Effects on age-birth-order ratios of such secular changes are minimized by using relative stillbirth ratios.
The estimate of the degree to which it was fashionable to bear a child in a specific

age-birth-order class is the relative live birth rate. This is the actual live birth rate specific for the age and birth order divided by the total live birth rate for women aged 10-49 in the population for that year. Changes in this measure reflect shifts in the age-birth-order specific rates relative to one another.
The critical question thus becomes: Is there an inverse relationship between relative stillbirth ratio and relative live birth rate? The answer to this question will come from examination of data for single agebirth-order combinations for single nations over a period of years.
It has been found empirically that graphs of relative stillbirth ratio against the natural log of relative live birth rate often approximate a straight line (for example, see Figure 1). For this reason, the statistical significance of the negative slope of the line calculated by the method of linear regression has been adopted as the criterion for affirming that an inverse relationship between the two variables does exist.
SOURCES OF DATA
Numbers of late fetal deaths, numbers of live births, and live birth rate for the United States were taken from Vital Statistics of the United States for seventeen years from 1947 through 1967. Figures were not published for 1952, 1953, and 1954. Also, 1955 was excluded because birth order was defined differently in the published data.
Data for Japan and France were obtained from Demographic Yearbook of the United Nations supplemented by late fetal death figures from Vital Statistics in Japan for 1958, 1959 and 1960 (supplied by S. Morifuku). The Japanese regressions are based on data from seventeen years, 1951 through 1967. Prior to 1951, the data were reported for late fetal deaths of shorter gestation. The French regressions are based on thir-

teen available years, 1951-53, 1956-8, and 1961-67.
EESULTS
Table 3 presents the results of the regression analyses for the first five orders of birth for each of six age groups. Four Japanese and two French age-birth-order combinations were represented by too few births to attempt analysis. Of the 84 completed analyses, 79 have negative regression coefficients and 5 have positive values. None of the five positive values approaches statistical significance and all come from data from the United States. However, 57 of the 79 negative values are significant at the five per cent or more stringent level.
Figures 1 through 5 display the data points for selected categories from Table 3. Figure 5 calls attention to results anticipated by the hypothesis. In each of the first three birth orders for women under twenty in France, the 1967 relative stillbirth ratio is sharply lower than is true for the other years and is notably lower than 1966, the immediately preceding year. This sharp drop in relative stillbirth ratio accompanied a sharp increase in relative live birth rate.
This relationship is shown in greater detail in Table 4. The overall live birth rate in 1967 continued the pattern of gradual reduction shown for the previous years. The overall stillbirth ratio for 1967 continued the pattern of slow improvement typical of the years before. The sharp drop in stillbirth ratios for the mothers under twenty is associated with the sharp increase in live birth rate for the same group. In contrast, the stillbirth ratio for mothers age 25-29 increased in the same year as the live birth rate for that group dropped.
DISCUSSION
The postulated negative relationship between relative live birth rate and relative stillbirth rate clearly existed for the United

States, Japan, and France during the years studied. The similarity of the relationship in the three countries is observed in the face of major differences in the data reported. The United States specifies registration of late fetal deaths with as little as twenty weeks completed gestation while the Japanese and French data are limited to gesta-

tions lasting at least twenty-eight weeks. The French data exclude illegitimate births and may be expected to reflect a different socioeconomic sample than the other two nations. The French live birth rates were reported as births per one-thousand married women.

birth ratio observed for a combination of mother's age and order of birth can be profoundly affected by changing fashions in the ages at which women within one society prefer to bear their children. This further indicates that vital data from these societies cannot be used to estimate a postulated biological effect of aging or parity on the risk of stillbirth. It further follows that the common practice in comparing stillbirth ratios between nations of standardizing those rates for differences in ages and birth orders between the nations is unwarranted.
This does not mean that there are necessarily no effects properly attributable to age or order of birth. It does mean that any

attempt to estimate these effects must be made from different kinds of data. Such an attempt is now in progress.
Restraint must be exercised in utilizing the regression analyses in this paper. The linearity is only an approximation within the range of the existing data. Extrapolation beyond the range of these data is unwarranted. It is proposed that the relationship between relative stillbirth ratio and relative live birth rate is the consequence of the occurrence of a relatively stable distribution of stillbirths experienced by stillbirth-prone women while the number of live births in any age-order group fluctuates widely in response to changing preferences among the

majority of stillbirth-resistant women. Social changes could upset the stability of the numerator and thereby destroy the linearity even within the range of live birth rates represented in the data. The rapidly expanding availability of inexpensive and safe abortions in recent years in the United States might have the effect of importantly reducing the contribution of women of low socioeconomic status to the numbers of stillbirths observed. The expected consequence would be that the relative stillbirth ratio should fall to a level lower than predicted by the regression analysis based on earlier years. The age-birth-order classes which

should be most strongly affected would be the higher birth orders at lowageof mother.
There is no reason to anticipate that the regression lines for different societies forone combination of age of mother and order of birth should be similar because the form of the line is determined by social forces which are likely to differ among the nations.
