ABSTRACT: Within SES categories in the United States, racial and ethnic minorities generally fare less well on a variety of health-related indicators than do majority groups. Important differences exist within subgroups, however, and at present, these differences are poorly understood. In this paper we address Hispanic subgroup (Cuban American, Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Central/South American) differences in utilization of prenatal care. Data from the 1986 and 1987 national Linked Birth/Infant Death files are used to assess patterns of prenatal care utilization across subgroups. Using Kotelchuck's Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index, we find that when controlling for other factors, Cuban American and Puerto Rican women are more likely to obtain adequate care than are Hispanic women of Mexican or Central/South American origin. Other factors important in understanding utilization patterns include marital status, education level, birthplace, and region of the country. We conclude with a discussion of the relatively weak link between prenatal care and birth outcomes and identify important cultural factors that may be important in understanding why this relationship is not stronger.

Despite important advances in health care in recent years, substantial class and race/ethnic differences in morbidity and mortality remain. In summarizing recent research in this area, Williams et al. (1994, p. 30-31) conclude that "one of the most firmly established patterns in social epidemiology is the relationship between SES and health. Persons with high levels of income, education, or occupational status live longer and have lower rates of disease than their counterparts of lower social class."
To illustrate, the death rate from heart disease in the United States is 2.3 times higher among blue-collar workers than among managers and professionals (Navarro, 1991). Similar differences are found in rates of cancer and diabetes (Mantón et al., 1987). In these as in other areas, present trends

suggest that the gap between social classes will only increase, and that unless major changes occur, the disadvantaged working and living conditions of low-wage earners will continue to be reflected in comparatively higher rates of death and disease.
The problem is often compounded for racial and ethnic minorities (Navarro, 1991). Within socioeconomic (SES) categories, minority group members have higher mortality rates from a number of health conditions including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and their children experience increased risk from such diverse problems as asthma, lead poisoning, and accidents (Blendon et al., 1989; Braithwaite and Taylor, 1992; Freeman et al., 1987; Lieu et al., 1993). While the relatively strong correlation between SES and race has led some to use the latter

as a surrogate for the former, Williams et al. (1994) demonstrate that the two are not equivalent and that both must be considered in addressing questions of vulnerability and need.
A simple recognition of the disparities that exist, however, does not mean that we understand what produces them, or, more importantly, that we know how to develop equitable and effective policies for their redress. Several researchers have noted the need for additional work that addresses the specific factors that contribute to group differences in morbidity and mortality (Novella et al., 1991; Williams et al., 1994).
This paper addresses a modest piece of this larger research agenda by examining one major health indicator--the nature and quality of prenatal care received by pregnant women--for one U.S. ethnic minority, women of Hispanic/Latino origin. This health indicator is accepted as one of the better overall measures of access to health care and one that is linked to what are typically used as sentinel events to describe the health status of a given population--infant mortality and the number of infants with low birthweight (Warner, 1991). Our focus on the Hispanic/Latino population is based on the recognition that it is one of the most medically underserved groups in the United States (Marks et al., 1990) and one that is seriously understudied (Novella et al., 1991). In addition, because of the growing evidence of differences in health outcomes among the major Hispanic subgroups-- differences that clearly have important policy relevance--additional research making intragroup comparisons clearly is needed.

BACKGROUND
SES AND RACE/ETHNIC DIFFERENCES
IN PRENATAL CARE AND BIRTH
OUTCOMES
Perhaps no area has yielded more substantial evidence of the relative disadvantage of the poor and race/ethnic minorities than has research on birth outcomes. While overall rates of low birthweight and infant mortality have declined, the gap between those of higher and lower socioeconomic class and between majority and racial minority populations has remained (Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977; Brooks, 1975; Floyd, 1992; Markides and Barnes, 1977; Markides and McFarland, 1982; Moss and Carver, 1992). Clearly, the goal of bringing the life chances for children born to more disadvantaged groups in line with the more advantaged will not be achieved so long as SES remains a clear indicator of likelihood of adverse outcomes and so long as the mortality for some minority groups remains approximately twice as high as for whites (Alexander and Comely, 1987; Cramer, 1987; Gee, Lee, and Forthofer, 1976; Geronimus, 1987; Geronimus and Bound, 1990; Hummer, 1993; National Center for Health Statistics, 1992; Yankauer, 1990).
Efforts to improve birthweight and mortality rates among infants must focus on those events for which causal links have been most clearly established. It has been assumed for a number of years that quality prenatal care is one such event and that improving care is a cost-effective way to decrease the occurrence of low weight births and neonatal and infant mortality (Brown, 1988; Committee to Study

Low Birthweight, 1985; Frank et al., 1992; U.S. Congress, 1988). To the extent this assumption holds, improving access to prenatal care remains an important goal so long as a significant number of infant births occur to women who delay care until at least the second or third trimester of pregnancy or who do not receive prenatal care at all (National Center for Health Statistics, 1991).
A number of variables have been identified in the research literature as important correlates of the nature of prenatal care received (see, for example, Ingram et al., 1986; Institute of Medicine, 1985; 1988). Cramer (1987) has noted that single mothers and highschool dropouts have significantly higher rates of obtaining late or no prenatal care. Others have focused on what they define as the major obstacles to care. Harvey and Faber (1993), for example, categorize the primary obstacles as either financial (such as lack of health insurance, transportation problems, and problems with child care) or personal (such as ambivalence about the pregnancy, excessive physical or psychological stress, and negative attitudes toward health professionals).
A number of these financial and personal barriers are directly related to individual socioeconomic circumstances or to race/ethnicity. The result is that prenatal care underutilization continues to be more pronounced among the most disadvantaged (St. Clair et al., 1989). Thus, bringing the task of improving birth outcomes into the broader arena of the development of policies and programs to improve the health and health care opportunities of the underserved remains one of our most important challenges (Floyd, 1992).

THE IMPORTANCE OF EXAMINING
HISPANIC SUBGROUPS
Recent evidence on the differences among Hispanic subgroups makes it increasingly important that they be considered separately for both research and policy development purposes. Hispanics of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and other Central and South American origin differ markedly on major demographic, economic, social, and health characteristics (Angel and Worobey, 1991; Bean and Tienda, 1987; Frisbie and Bean, 1993; Mendoza et al., 1991). These differences are large enough that analyses based on pooled samples can be clearly misleading.
However, only limited research has addressed the major health-related subgroup differences, particularly as these differences are reflected in patterns of prenatal care and birth outcomes. Hummer et al. (1992), for example, note that because of the homogeneity in national origin of the larger Hispanic subgroups in some states and the lack of large Hispanic populations in others, less attention has been directed to possible birthweight and mortality differences for Hispanic births. Both Hummer et al. (1992) and Becerra et al. (1991) found significant heterogeneity in how the different Hispanic subgroups use the health care system as well as significant differences in outcomes. In both studies, infants of Puerto Rican descent were at a higher risk of low birthweight and neonatal mortality, while the opposite was true for Cuban-American infants.
Other studies report similar findings. For example, in an analysis of vital records from the State of Illinois,

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

Prenatal Care

Collins and Shay (1994) found that the proportion of low birthweight Hispanic infants ranged from 4.3 per cent for Mexicans to 9.1 per cent for Puerto Ricans (the number of Cuban respondents was insufficient for separate analysis). Similarly, Cohen et al. (1993), using Massachusetts birth certificate data, observed wide variation among Hispanic subgroups, with the highest level of risk for negative birth outcomes occurring among Puerto Ricans.
Finally, Albrecht et al. (1994), using national linked birth/infant death records to assess the influence of a number of sociodemographic and medical care variables on prematurity, low birthweight, and mortality, also report significant differences among subgroups. The most consistent finding was the relatively advantaged position of Cuban-Americans and the relatively disadvantaged position of Puerto Ricans. Multivariate models indicated that while some of the subgroup differences are due to distinct sociodemographic profiles, other differences remained even when controlling for these factors.
While these studies have examined patterns of low birthweight and infant mortality among Hispanic subgroups, similar comparisons of prenatal care are less evident. Research on prenatal care among Hispanics overall suggests that, excluding Cubans, only about 60 per cent of Hispanic women initiate prenatal care in the first trimester, compared with 80 per cent of nonHispanic white women. Non-Cuban origin Hispanics are also three times more likely to receive no prenatal care at all, at least as measured through contact with the formal health care system (Council on Scientific Affairs, 1991). Thus, as a group, they tend to

be significant underutilizers of preventive health services (Marks et al., 1990).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study will address the utilization of prenatal care by Hispanic subgroups in the United States. Prior research suggests that the differential use of prenatal care from one group to another is a contributor to observed differences in birth outcomes (Frank et al., 1992). However, further understanding of this linkage is dependent upon research that addresses the question of the degree to which subgroup differences exist and an assessment of their potential causes.
DATA SOURCE
To address our research questions, we use data from the 1986 and 1987 national Linked Birth/Infant Death data set (National Center for Health Statistics, 1992). This data set contains information on births to Hispanic women in the United States and includes an identifier that allows examination of the major Hispanic subgroups. Two years of data were used to provide sample sizes within the subgroups that were sufficient for multivariate analysis.
The Linked Birth/Infant Death file is based on two existing data sources: state files for the identification of linked birth and infant death certificates and NCHS natality and mortality computerized statistical files, the source of computer records for the two linked certificates. The NCHS natality and mortality files are produced annually and include statistical data from birth and death certificates that are provided to NCHS by states under the

42

Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. State data are coded according to uniform specification. The national linked data set consists of two separate files for each year. The first file includes linked records of live births and infant deaths for the individual birth cohort. The second file is the live birth file for the given year. The files are compiled as a numerator/denominator data set to allow users the means to compute infant mortality rates. The 1986 birth cohort included 390,191 births and 3,292 infant deaths; the 1987 birth cohort included 407,225 births and 3,363 infant deaths.
The linked birth/death data set contains specific information that allows one to determine the nature of prenatal care received (timing, number of prenatal care visits, source of care), as well as information on parental sociodemographic characteristics and other pertinent predictors of care utilization and birth outcomes. However, there are also important limitations imposed by the data. For example, the quality of the information obtained on the birth certificate has always been a matter of concern. To cite just one example, data on gestational age, if reported incorrectly, can result in an overstatement of the effects of prenatal care on birth outcomes due to the positive association between the use of more prenatal care among women who have longer gestational periods. For this reason, the magnitude of the effects of prenatal care may sometimes be overstated.
Additionally, specific information on such theoretically relevant indicators as family income, access to medical care, or family structure characteristics is not included. As a result, some

of the most important potential predictors of prenatal care utilization among Hispanic groups are not available. Nonetheless, these data provide a starting point for making Hispanic subgroup comparisons and will allow us, through our focus on predictors of prenatal care utilization, to add to the work of Becerra et al. (1991), and Hummer et al. (1992) on Hispanic subgroup birth outcomes.
MEASURES
The primary dependent variable of interest is prenatal care utilization. Although there have been numerous attempts to measure the adequacy of prenatal care received by pregnant women (Kessner et al., 1973), the measure we employ in the current analysis is the "Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index" developed by Kotelchuck (1994). This index characterizes prenatal care utilization on two related dimensions--timing of initiation of prenatal care and adequacy of received services based on the gestation age of the infant and the number of prenatal visits received. The initial dimension assesses timing of initiation of prenatal care and assumes that the earlier care begins, the better. The second dimension characterizes the adequacy of received visits from initiation through delivery. This dimension determines if the woman received the appropriate number of visits for the period she was receiving prenatal care, i.e., a ratio of expected to actual visits based on date of entry into care. Using the two dimensions, we define adequacy of prenatal care utilization as (1) inadequate, (2) intermediate, (3) adequate, and (4) intensive. According to Kotelchuck, inadequate care is care begun after the

fourth month of pregnancy or fewer than 50 per cent of the visits recommended by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG). Intermediate care is that care in which 50 to 79 per cent of the ACOG recommended visits have been received. Adequate care must begin by the fourth month of pregnancy and the woman must have between 80 and 109 per cent of the ACOG recommended prenatal care visits. Finally, intensive care refers to a situation where the woman enters care by the fourth month and includes 110 per cent or more of the expected number of visits. A summary of the criteria for the prenatal care index is given as Table 1.
Kotelchuck's index does not take into account risk conditions of the mother, and although this is a limitation, the ACOG guidelines for determining adequacy were made in 1985 for women without additional risks. The result of using this standard is to create a conservative index, i.e., an index that understates what ACOG would consider appropriate for a woman with any type of elevated risk profile, or that overclassifies women into the intensive category. Although not a perfect measure of prenatal care adequacy, Kotelchuck's index is the best currently available.
A number of variables are used in the model to predict adequacy of pre-

natal care, as these variables are available in the Linked Birth/Infant Death data file. In addition to Hispanic subgroup (defined as Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Cuban American, and Central/South American), other variables in the predictive models include (1) race of the birth father (nonHispanic black, non-Hispanic white, or Hispanic), (2) region of the country (West, Midwest, South, or Northeast), (3) education of the mother, (4) age, and (5) marital status.
RESULTS
Table 2 provides the distributions by Hispanic subgroup of the variables included in the models. As can be seen, there are major differences among subgroups. For example, the proportion of women who were born outside the U.S. or Canada varies from over 90 per cent of those who were classified as Central/South Americans, to just over 46 per cent of Puerto Ricans. Puerto Rican women were more likely to be under 18 and not married, while Cuban Americans were least likely to fall into either of these categories. Cuban women had substantially higher levels of education with over 44 per cent reporting at least some post-highschool work. On the other hand, over 40 per cent of Mexican American women reported fewer than ten years

of education. Puerto Rican women were most likely to enter into prenatal care late, and Cuban American women were least likely to do so. Children born to Mexican American women were most likely to have a Hispanic birth-father, while this was least likely to be true for Puerto Rican women. Overall, these basic descriptive data demonstrate that Cuban women are

quite different from other subgroups of Hispanic women on several of the indicators and represent a category of respondents that, in many respects, is more like non-Hispanic white women than others of their broad ethnic classification. The bivariate relationships summarized in Table 2 are generally consistent with the existing literature in indicating that Cubans are the most ad-

vantaged and Puerto Ricans are the least advantaged on those factors generally assumed to be important predictors of birth outcomes (specifically, younger age, single marital status, and later entry into prenatal care).
APPLYING A PROBIT SELECTIVITY
MODEL
In order to compute Kotelchuck's measure of adequacy of care, we must have information on both the timing of entry into care as well as the number of visits completed. Although the linked birth/death data base described above includes the required variables, a significant number of women do not have all necessary data on their individual records to compute the index. Specifically, a large number of women donot have complete visit information on their birth record, meaning that selectivity bias may be a problem in the subsequent analysis. Selectivity bias is present when women with complete information on the number of visits differ systematically from those who have incomplete information. Such differences may be observable or unobservable. For example, in the context of the present study, if women from one Hispanic subgroup systematically had less complete records than women from the other subgroups, this could lead us to underestimate the effects of subgroup membership on level of care received simply because of the process whereby women completed information on the number of visits.
Because of the possibility of suchbiased selection into the sample, weemployed a modified Heckman's (1979) correction for selectivity bias in our analyses. This correction involved estimating a probit equation which

predicted whether the woman had complete information on number of visits. Subsequently, we statistically corrected for the selectivity bias when estimating the ordered probit model for adequacy of prenatal care.
The data in Tables 3 and 4, showing the results of the probit selectivity model, indicate that there was systematic selection into the final sample.1 Specifically, women who lived in the west and the northeast were more likely to have incomplete visit information and thus were less likely to be included in the final analysis of prenatal care utilization than women who lived in the midwest. Conversely, women who lived in the south were more likely to have enough information to be included in the final sample than women from other areas. The data in Table 3 also show that women who were pregnant by a white father were more likely to have incomplete information on visits than were other women. Finally, women with higher levels of education were more likely to have complete visit information and be included in thefinal analysis than women with less than ten years of education. This systematic self selection bias is statistically adjusted in the subsequent analysis of level of prenatal care received.

explain subgroup differences in prenatal care. To do that, we begin with the results of an ordered probit model that predicts level of adequacy of prenatal care received by each of the Hispanic subgroups. The analytic methodology is discussed fully in Zavoina and McKelvey (1975) and will not be elaborated here. However, because this particular method of analysis may be unfamiliar to some readers, we note that the interpretation of the coefficients is relatively straightforward. Specifically, for any combination of the independent variables, the probit equation allows us to predict the probability what the dependent variable is in each of the four categories of prenatal care adequacy. It follows from

this that the individual coefficients can be interpreted as measuring the amount of change in the dependent variable on its unobserved underlying scale associated with a unit change in the independent variable. However, since we only observe imperfectly measured or rank-ordered categories of adequacy, the coefficients measure the incremental change in the probability of being in the next higher adequacy category associated with a one-unit change in the independent variable. If the independent variables are categorical, as is the case with membership in a given Hispanic subgroup or marital status, the coefficient in the ordered probit model measures the increment in the probability of one being in the

next higher level of adequacy as a result of membership in one subgroup compared to another, or one state of matrimony compared to another (the excluded category in the analysis).2
To address the question of whether the level of adequacy of prenatal care received differs for the four specific Hispanic subgroups, we present a sequence of models, each of which adds additional variables that are theoretically important in explaining level of care. The first model formally addresses the finding observed in Table 2 that the level of adequacy of care is affected by subgroup membership. Each of the additional models sequentially adds additional variables to determine if the subgroup differences observed in the bivariate analysis (and the first model) are maintained. The variables added to the initial model (and reflected in each of the more specified models), include mother's birthplace, age, education, marital status, race/ ethnicity of the birth father, parity, and region of the country.
Cuban women have the best birth outcomes and are more advantaged economically. Because of this, we will use them as the comparison group. Given this reference point, the coeffi-
2The ordered probit model formulation employed in LIMDEP is that developed by Zavoina and McElvey (1975). The model is specified as: Z =  + ,  ~ N (0, 1), Y = 0 if Z µ0, 1 if µ0 < Z µ1, 2 if µ1 < Z µ2, . . . J if Z > µj-1 where the observed counterpart of Z is Y (the observed level of prenatal care), and µ is a vector of free parameters to be estimated. Estimates are obtained by maximum likelihood, and the probabilities which enter the likelihood function are: Prob (y = j) = Prob (zi is in the jth range) of the ordered category established by the values of µ. The ordered probit model with sample selection adds the selection mechanism: Wi* = 'Xj2 + u, ui ~ N (0, 1), Wi = 1 if W* > 0 and 0 otherwise, i.e., theunivariate probit model, and, most importantly, Y is observed if and only if Wi = 1.

cients in Model 1 in Table 5 show that Cuban women are significantly more likely to have higher levels of prenatal care than any of the other three Hispanic subgroups. Indeed, the magnitude of the coefficients for Central/ South American women (-0.24), Mexican women (--0.29), and Puerto Rican women (-0.28) indicate that compared to Cuban women, the probability of receiving higher levels of prenatal care decreases at roughly comparable levels for women of all other subgroups.
As a companion analysis to the probit model result in Table 5, Table 6 presents classification results indicating the degree to which knowledge of position on the relevant independent variable (i.e., subgroup membership) allows correct prediction into individual care levels. By examining the classification results for Model 1 in Table 6, we note that knowledge of Hispanic subgroup membership does not correctly place any women into the intermediate or intensive levels of prenatal care. However, simply knowing the subgroup membership allows for correct classification of approximately 90 per cent of the women receiving inadequate prenatal care. Conversely, knowledge of subgroup membership allows correct classification of only 20 per cent of those receiving adequate care.
The results of Model 1 indicate that, when other important characteristics of the woman are not formally considered, there are significant subgroup differences in levels of prenatal care received by Hispanic women, as was reflected in the bivariate results. The remainder of the analysis focuses on the question of what happens to these

subgroup differences when other factors are controlled.
Whether or not the birth mother was born outside the United States has been shown to impact the level of prenatal care received. Mother's origin was also shown in Table 2 to be related to Hispanic subgroup membership. Hence, there is an expectation that controlling for this factor may change, or even eliminate, some of the observed subgroup differences. The results of Model 2 address this issue. As expected, if the birth mother was born outside the United States, the probability of receiving higher levels of prenatal care decreases by --0.17. However, controlling for this factor does little to the originally observed relationship between subgroup membership and level of prenatal care received. Compared to Cuban women, each of the other subgroups still have deceased probabilities of higher levels of care ranging from -0.24 for Puerto Rican women to -0.28 for women of Central or South American descent.
Model 3 presents results when both birth place and age of mother are included in the analysis. As anticipated, older women have slightly increased probabilities of receiving higher levels of prenatal care. Further, when controlling for age, the net effect of mother's place of birth increases from -0.17 in Model 2 to -0.22 in Model 3.
As was true in both Models 1 and 2, there are important subgroup differences with Cuban women having significantly higher probabilities of receiving higher levels of prenatal care than any other group. However, controlling for age and birth place of the mother changes the original relationship. For Puerto Rican women, the

probability of receiving higher levels of care is -0.20 lower than for Cuban women. However, if the woman is of Central/South American descent, the decreased probability is --0.33. This figure indicates that a Cuban woman is over one-third more likely to receive higher levels of prenatal care than Central/South American women. An examination of the classification results presented in Table 6 for the third model demonstrates an interesting point. Knowledge of age increases the correct classification of women who receive adequate prenatal care from 20 per cent (Models 1and 2) to 32 per cent (Model 3). Knowledge of age also results in the classification of 3,287 women into the intensive prenatal care category although only 822 of the women are correctly classified in this level.
The data in Table 2 showed a relationship between level of education and subgroup membership of the women. Further, research has consistently shown a relationship between level of education and level of prenatal care received. The results of adding education to the model are presented in column four of Table 5. Consistent with other literature, higher levels of education are associated with increased probabilities of receiving higher levels of prenatal care. Of particular interest in the current study is what happens to the impact of subgroup membership when education is controlled. An examination of the coefficients shows that with education controlled, the disadvantage of Mexican women relative to Cuban women is decreased by over one-half. Central/ South American women remain the most disadvantaged (b = -0.29), and

the woman was born outside of the U.S. (e.g., in Puerto Rico, Mexico, or Cuba), the probability of receiving higher levels of prenatal care is significantly lower (b = -0.25) than for women who were born in the U.S. Similarly, the probability of receiving more intensive prenatal care decreases as the level of parity increases (b = --0.18). This finding is consistent with the idea that as the experience of pregnancy and childbirth becomes more familiar, the perceived need for prenatal care is reduced. However, this result is also consistent with a finding that access (as determined by financial indicators) may be more restricted for women with larger families.
The findings also demonstrate an impact of region of the country on the receipt of level of prenatal care received. Specifically, if a woman lives in the northeast, she is predicted to receive the lowest level of care followed by women in the south and the west, respectively. Women living in the midwest (the excluded category) have significantly higher probabilities of higher levels of prenatal care than any other region.
BINOMIAL LOGIT MODEL
The findings just presented identified those characteristics of the woman that lead to differential use of prenatal care. However, the classification matrix at the bottom of Table 4 indicates that the model fits modestly with only 42 per cent of the cases classified correctly. Further, the distribution of the cases in the classification matrix point out that the model was completely unsuccessful in correctly predicting women into the "intermediate" category, and only correctly predicted 5

per cent into the intensive category. Conversely, the model was relatively successful in predicting women who received either inadequate care (85 per cent correctly classified) and moderately successful in predicting women who receive adequate care (48 per cent). Consequently, we were interested in verifying the maternal characteristics that differentiated women who received less than adequate care from those who received care that was adequate or more. To accomplish this result, we estimated the binomial logit model presented in Tables 7 and 8. The results from the logit model are summarized below.
Consistent with the results from the ordered probit model, Central/South American women and Mexican women were significantly less likely to receive higher levels of care than their Cuban counterparts. The results from the logit model again place women from these two subgroups in a position of relative disadvantage compared to Cuban women. The measured odds of receiving adequate or intensive care are approximately 29 per cent lower for Central/South American women, and 21 per cent lower for Mexican women than for Cuban women. The results from the logit analysis further suggest that women who are married (b = 0.45), women who have more than twelve years of education (b = 0.61) and women who are older (b = 0.45) are more likely to receive care that is deemed at least adequate. The odds of receiving adequate care is 1.57 times higher for married women than for women who are not married, and women with more than twelve years of education are almost twice as likely (OR = 1.84) to receive adequate care

than women with less than ten years of education. Conversely, Hispanic women whowere born in their country of origin were 36 per cent less likely (b = -0.44) to receive adequate care than their counterparts whowere born in the United States. Further, and once again consistent with the results from the earlier ordered probit analysis, women are less likely to receive adequate care if they are giving birth to their second or later child.

DISCUSSION
Our findings confirm previous analyses that suggest that there will besignificant differences among Hispanic subgroups on indicators of health and health care utilization. Overall, Cuban Americans are relatively advantaged when compared to the other groups, The differences among subgroups in prenatal care utilization are at least as large as those that typically distinguish

between Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups in the United States. In a companion analysis (Albrecht et al., 1994) we have determined that in terms of birth outcomes, Puerto Ricans have rates of adverse outcomes that are typical of the black population in this country, while the Cubans do better than non-Hispanic whites. Our bivariate results are generally consistent with previous research in suggesting that Cubans are the most advantaged and Puerto Ricans least advantaged in our measures of adequacy of prenatal care. The multivariate analysis reveals that these differences are systematically reduced as other variables are entered into the model, but it is only when we get to the most fully specified model that the Cuban/Puerto Rican differences become statistically nonsignificant. Of all the variables that play a part in reducing the magnitude of the differences between these groups, marital status has the greatest impact on the size of the coefficients. It appears that the greater propensity for Puerto Rican women not to be married at the time they give birth is what most distinguishes them from Cuban women when it comes to explaining differences in prenatal care.
None of the controls that are entered into the multivariate models reduce to the point of nonsignificance the differences in adequacy of prenatal care between Cuban women and those whose ethnic origins are in Mexico or Central/South America. However, some of the controls do substantially reduce the size of the coefficients, as is the case when education level is added for Mexican women. While the Puerto Rican differences are reduced by the combination of the several variables

that are controlled in the models, this reduction does not happen for the other two groups. Our final results indicate that in terms of prenatal care adequacy, Puerto Ricans are more similar to Cubans when other factors are entered into the model, and both have higher levels of care than women of either Mexican or Central/South American origin. Taken together, these findings reaffirm the contention that Hispanic groups must be considered individually in health-related research and policy development. Grouping them into a single analytical category has the potential to mask too many important subgroup differences.
In addition to Hispanic subgroup, other variables in our analyses that were important in understanding prenatal care adequacy include marital status, education, birthplace, and region of residence: Married women obtain better care than single women; the higher educated score higher on the utilization index than those with less education; women born in the U.S. have better access to prenatal care than those born outside the U.S.; and those who live in the midwest obtain better care than women living in other areas of the country.
We conclude with some observations designed to bridge our present effort with future research that is sorely needed to move our state of knowledge forward. While we have noted that there are important differences among Hispanic subgroups in terms of utilization of prenatal care, the fact remains that whatever the level of care received, Hispanic birth outcomes (as measured by rates of low weight births and infant mortality) tend to be comparatively good. This finding does not

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

Prenatal Care

55

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

deny subgroup differences that result in Cuban American rates being generally more favorable than rates for non-Hispanic whites, at one end, and Puerto Rican rates more nearly comparable with non-Hispanic blacks, at the other. Nevertheless, even when controlling for their comparatively higher risk profiles, Hispanics do comparatively well on infant-related health measures.
What this means is that while significant attention has been given in recent years to increasing the quality of prenatal care as one way of increasing rates of positive birth outcomes, that link may not be as strong as has been assumed. Recent findings note, for example, that the substantial increase in the proportion of U.S. women who initiate care in the first trimester in the past two decades has not been accompanied by a-significant decline in lowbirthweight infants (Mustard and Roos, 1994). Clearly, this finding has important theoretical, empirical, and practical significance. The logic of many health-related reforms has been clear. If we increase access to prenatal care among disadvantaged populations, we will decrease the occurrence of low birthweight infants and infant mortality. Yet, if evidence for a beneficial effect of early and frequent prenatal care on birthweight remains ambiguous, then this finding calls into question a very important assumption.
Data indicating inconsistencies between risk profiles (as measured by entry into prenatal care) and outcomes for Hispanic Americans is supported by recent work on Asian Americans (Morrow et al., 1994; Singh and Yu, 1994). Compared to Anglos, Asian Americans have a lower proportion of

women who receive prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy and a higher proportion of women who receive no prenatal care at all; yet, like Hispanic women, they demonstrate lower rates of negative birth outcomes than their risk profiles would predict. What is increasingly clear from this is that much of the variance remains unexplained by current models. While our data have not allowed us to address these issues directly, we can briefly note some suggestions for future research that, we believe, clearly follow from the available literature.
One line of reasoning, with particular reference to Hispanics is that because Hispanics, and particularly first generation immigrants, choose a more healthy lifestyle, the absence of prenatal care as reflected in the timing and number of visits to a formal care provider may be less important. Much of what is emphasized during prenatal visits reflects on dietary patterns, rest, etc., all of which may more closely characterize a culturally defined lifestyle. Further, family relationships may be critical in translating cultural patterns into actual practice. Close family relationships may contribute to better prenatal care even when this does not occur through the formal health care system. As reported earlier by St. Clair et al. (1989), underutilizers are more embedded in networks of family and kin and this, in turn, can lead to decreased reliance on the services of professional providers.
Unmeasured family and cultural factors may be particularly important in the Hispanic context. Among Hispanics generally, the concept of "family" refers to more than just the nuclear family. It incorporates the idea of la

Social Biology

familia, or the greater family, which includes relatives that are traced on both male and female sides (Alvarez, 1993). Because of the importance of this greater family, Hispanics are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to live in extended family relationships and these extended kin generally assume greater responsibility for family wellbeing and quality of life.
If these arguments are correct, it may mean that there exists a greater family-driven tendency to encourage positive and to avoid negative health behaviors on the part of Hispanics, as compared with other groups, and this tendency may contribute to more favorable health outcomes. This situation may help account for the finding that as Hispanics become more acculturated, their health status actually worsens (Scribner and Dwyer, 1989). Acculturation may involve moving away from cultural and family patterns that have been protective of more healthy lifestyles, even in the context of less access to the formal health care system. In the specific case of prenatal care utilization, late or less frequent

contact with the formal care network may be much less of a liability in those instances where some of the more basic health-related needs are being met because of familial and cultural expectations and lifestyles. We emphasize that this link between family and cultural factors and birth outcomes is largely speculative. Research designed to address these specific relationships is clearly needed.
In conclusion, we believe that the relative ineffectiveness of current models in predicting birth outcomes remains an issue for at least two important reasons. First, the relationship between SES and race/ethnicity and morbidity and mortality in numerous other health-outcomes settings is clearly established. Why is it less important in research on birth outcomes? Second, the possibility that factors not included in current models that are protective against risk in some cultural settings may be generalizable to others deserves further exploration. Clearly, both issues require continued research attention.
