The purpose of this paper is to further examine the relationship of family size and school achievement. The argument is often made that children in small families "do better" academically because of the intensity of their interaction with their parents. This intensity of interaction is presumably demonstrated by parental involvement in the child's study, hence higher achievement. With an increase in size comes a diminution of this adult-child relationship, hence poorer academic achievement from the children of the larger families.
In a recent article, in which the relationship of family size and the well-being of its members was discussed, Lieberman (1970, p. 2) indicates:
In 1964, the Presidential Task Force on Manpower Conservation found that about 70 percent of Selective Service rejects came from families of four children or more, though only 33 percent of the nation's children came from such families. A further breakdown showed that 47 percent of the rejects came from the 11 percent of the children who were members of families with six or more offspring! Interpretation of these results is difficult because large family size and poverty were associated and could not be separated for analysis.
While Lieberman did point out the inade-

quacy of the data because control of socioeconomic status was not possible, perhaps his inclusion of the example cited as to how family size affects children is not warranted. Without such a control, the data really mean very little.
Wray (1971, p. 422-429) presents various findings relative to the size of family and intelligence. His conclusion states that the effects of family size on intelligence was not ameliorated by social class. A careful reexamination of these data was conducted by Thomas (1972, unpublished) who concluded that the effects of family size on intelligence is ameliorated by social class.
The above are only a few of many reports, generally produced by writers who treat population problems. However, several writers (Higgins, Reed, and Reed, 1962; Kennett and Cropley, 1970; and Cattell, 1951) have pointed out that academic achievement is not a function of family size.
The current question to be considered is the relationship of grades to family size. Other studies have reported an inverse relationship between family size and IQ. Our assumption is that when achievement

(grades) is examined, most of the variance can be explained in terms of social class; that is, larger families are generally from the lower classes and their class position would negatively affect the grades they receive. This tends to occur both because the schools are oriented to the middle class and because there may be organizational factors which work against the lower class students getting good grades.
It may be argued that parents who have few children would not only be able to provide more resources such as financial help, economic goods, etc., per child, but they would also be in a position to offer more "adult to child contact." The assumption is made that it is such conduct with adults which should promote better grades. On the other hand, one may argue that a child who has more sibs will have more interaction with them, including perhaps some assistance with school problems which would yield higher grades. A student today with a math problem, for example, may be hard pressed to obtain any help from a parent who received his training in mathematics years ago and has had no training in the "new math."
Responses from 2,926 male adolescents and 3,127 female adolescents {N = 6,053) from twenty-seven different high schools are reported in this paper.1 The sample approximates a cluster sample, but strictly speaking is an accidental sample. An attempt was made to have participating high schools in all major regions of the United States; however, the sample is slightly biased in favor of the Inter-mountain West. The Northeastern part of the country is underrepresented. Because of the interest of high school administrators in this re-

search, the refusal rate was lower than originally anticipated. Only seven school districts declined the invitation to participate in the research. Three of those districts were in the Northeast.
In some cases, all of the students who were invited to participate went into the school auditorium or gymnasium. In other cases, the questionnaires were administered in the classrooms. All students were instructed how to complete the questionnaire. Within each of the individual high schools the sample consisted of either the total population in school that day or a cluster sample selected from required classes such as English, mathematics, and health.
Table 1 represents the number of sibs the respondents had, along with their selfreported grades. Examination of the table indicates that for the respondents who reported having no sibs 73.8% of the respondents in the "upper class" reported grades of B or better; 47.3% of the respondents in the "middle class" and 47.4% of the respondents designated as "lower. class" reported "high" grades. S.E.S. was obtained using the McGuire Index which utilizes income, occupation, education, and religion to assign S.E.S. position (McGuire, unpublished). Examination of the other columns, with one to three sibs, four or five sibs, and six or more sibs indicate a similar class difference.
The very interesting point to be made from this table is that there is no significant difference moving across the rows, from "no sibs" to "Six or more sibs," while controlling for social class. Thus, the upper class indicates 73.8% of only-child respondents with high grades; 74.2% with one to three sibs, 72.5% with four or five sibs, and 69.6% with six or more sibs all reported high grades. The gamma is very low, less than 0.05 for each of the three groups.

These data do not support the position that larger numbers of children in a family produces lower grades because of lack of contact with parents. However, neither do they support the position that sibs cooperate and increase performance as far as high-school grades are concerned. Understandably, grades and intelligence are not the same, but grades may be a crude index of intelligence.
Inasmuch as we are interested in whether these findings would be mitigated in a subculture which is supportive of large families, as has been postulated (Hurley and Palonen, 1967), an additional study was made using a sample from such a subculture. This sample consisted of university students who, for the most part, are Mormon. The Mormon Church is very much in favor of its members having several children and in general not restricting births, except in a very few situations where the health of the mother is involved.
A 6% sample of the Brigham Young University student body was randomly drawn by using a computer program. General information contained on the computer file for each of those students was printed. This included some data on the parents such as education and residence as well as information about the students such as grades in high school and the university, major for each semester by department and college, and marital status. American College test scores (ACT) and high-school grade point averages were available for many of these students. University grades were available for almost all of them.
However, family size, the variable of interest in the present research, was not available. As a consequence, the researcher and assistants utilized several methods to obtain the number of sibs as well as additional data to be reported elsewhere. We telephoned the students for whom telephones were available and then mailed a

questionnaire to those who had no telephones or who could not otherwise be reached in order to supplement the file information. In fifty cases both the phone call and questionnaire were used for the same respondent. Comparison of the data from both sources indicate that the data are reliable.
This sample included 661 male and 565 female respondents (N = 1,226), all of ·whom were currently attending the university, or who had attended the previous semester and who were still on file and available to provide the additional information. The additional information was coded and transferred along with the data from the computer's file to IBM cards via scanning sheets. Pearson correlations were then computed for family size by the various measures of grade achievements. In some cases the N varies because of the unavailability of ACT scores which were missing for older students who did not take those examinations. They were not offered when some of them entered the University.
The achieved grade measures studied in this paper included the ACT scores for the English, Math, Social Science, Natural

All of the above are familiar to most people except for the high school core grade point average. The core excludes all classes such as physical education and chorus and generally includes only academic classes.

relationships between family size and grades for university students.
Closer examination of the relationship between the number of sibs and the university grade-point average is shown in Table 3. Unfortunately, we had no other indicator of social class than the father's education. Using this as a control, we are able to examine the association of family size with grade-point average and find that the father's education appears to make some difference in terms of the percentage receiving "low" and "high" grades.
While the number of respondents is understandably lower, note the tendency for larger families to have more of the "high" grades. However, for the left and right part of the table, there is no statistically significant difference.
Partial correlations of first, second, and third order, for number of children, father's education, and sex of the respondent also indicate no statistically significant differences. Difference of means tests (using the T-test) for the mean cumulative gradepoint average for small, medium, and large families while controlling father's education and sex were also not statistically significant. In short, the data do not support the idea that there are grade-point differences associated with family size.
The argument may be made that students at Brigham Young University do not represent the whole spectrum of Mormon society and therefore cannot be used to indicate the effects of the Mormon culture which has positive rewards for the large family. A closer examination of the data from the high schools, reported above, will provide data to examine the argument.
Data from Peterson's study permit us to examine Mormon high school students and to compare them with other religions. Table 4 presents the respondents who either indicated no religious affiliation or were Catholic, Protestant, or Mormon. Other groups
