The problem with this method is that the only way to test for correct separation is by using the sperm to fertilize a female and then checking on the offspring, a method which is not practical for humans. Electrophoresis of human sperm has been attempted, but there has been no test for X Y separation. It has been suggested that application of the differential staining of sperm (Barlow and Vosa, 1970) could allow this kind of separation to be developed (Markle and Nam, 1971). However, all of these methods require artificial insemination with sperm previously separated outside the body.
The second type of separation involves discrimination against selected sperm inside the female after natural intercourse. Use of an alkaline douche to discriminate against X sperm has been proposed, but results have been inconclusive. The fact that Y sperm swim faster than X sperm might also be used for discrimination purposes, but apparently no work has been done to try to apply this fact for these purposes.
The last determination method is that of selective abortion of offspring of the undesired sex. This would require some improvement of the present ability to sex an unborn child without harming the child if the abortions were to be performed early enough in pregnancy to avoid endangering the mother (Crawford, personal communication). This method would certainly meet very strong social resistance, and for that reason if for no other, it is likely that it would not be used on a large scale.
For more about these methods and for history of the subject, see Markle and Nam (1971) or Gordon (1958).
THE MODEL
To determine in a quantitative, if rough, way what the effects on the sex ratio at birth could be if the ability to predetermine sex were available and were used, a model

was developed. In this model, a "female" is represented by three variables: age, number of male children, and number of female children (or A, M, and F ) . In a given year of her life, four things can happen: (1) birth of a male child, (2) birth of a female child, (3) exit from the model due to either death or the voluntary decision to have no more children, or (4) the birth of no child, which amounts to direct advancement into the next age category. Probabilities for each of these events (PI, P2, P3, and P4, respectively) are determined from the three variables describing the female at the beginning of the year. By comparing these probabilities with a random number between zero and one, it is possible to decide which of the four events shall actually "occur" at each year in the reproductive span of a female. The births that do occur can be tabulated for as many females as is desired to determine what the actual sex ratio at birth would be for a real population with similar characteristics.
As it now stands, this model would require considerable data in order to determine the four probabilities. There are three independent probabilities per state that the females can occupy, and the number of such states is the product of the duration of fertility and ( » + 1) ( » + 2)/2, where n is the maximum number of children that can be in a family. In order to limit the possible data while still approximating reality in some sense, the following data were used: (1) birth probabilities for U.S. women by age (five year groupings, IS to 44 years) and by number of previous live births, or parity, taken from 1965 data (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1969), as shown in Table 1; and (2) mortality rates by age for white U.S. women, again for 1965 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1967), Table 2. Since these data are from a single year but are being applied to a cohort of women, the results

To provide a starting point with which to compare more complicated versions of the model, a simple version was made in which the birth probabilities were distributed between male and female children by simply taking the appropriate number from Table 1 and giving 51.15% of it to P I , the probability of a male birth, and the re-

attributed to socioeconomic factors (Teitelbaum and Mantel, 1971). If a more detailed model were to be constructed, it might prove worthwhile to incorporate dependence on these factors; but for the present purposes, the constant will suffice.
For this first model, the probability of exit from the model, P3, was taken directly from Table 2, the mortality rates, and P4, the probability of simply aging, is then 1 -- (PI + P2 -f- P3). No allowance was made for the possibility of a birth and maternal

death occuring in the same year. If the probabilities of birth and maternal death are assumed independent, as they arein this model, there is a very small joint probability, which has been ignored. Since the mortality rates used include deaths associated with childbirth, the total deaths in a large sample should be nearly correct. But, again, this is sufficient reason for limiting interpretation of the results to qualitative rather than quantitative statements.
Using a PDP-10 computer, this model was run through ten trials, each of which consisted of 10,000 females entering the model at age IS. The results of the ten trials were averaged, and this number appears in the first row of Table 3. It should

the model, it turns out that the number of male children has the same probability of lying in the range 1461 ± 30, not± 1 7 .
The average sex ratio is 1.047, which corresponds to a sex proportion of 51.15% males, as expected. The standard deviations of this value and of all the ratios in Table 3 are small enough to enable one to make meaningful comparisons between these values as the more inventive versions of the model are discussed.

be noted that the standard deviations given are an indication of the expected deviation from the mean of a sample of 10,000 females, although the numbers in Table 3are given per 1,000 females. For example, if 10,000 females are run through the model, the number of male children will have approximately a 0.683 chance of lying within one standard deviation of the number given as the mean in Table 3, or 14,610 ± 170. However, if 1,000 females are run through

This provides a more graphic description of the results of the model and will serve as a further point of reference against which the later models can be meaningfully compared. Notice the fairly smooth, regular form, slightly twisted toward an excess of males.
The next three models differ from the first in that sex predetermination is applied toward maintaining equal numbers of male and female children in each family (deaths of children are not accounted for, however, and could conceivably modify the results if taken into account). When males equal females, PI and P2 are determined as in the first model. When they are unequal, the minority sex is chosen at the appropriate fertility rate. Model 2 assumes that this choice is 100%effective. Model 3 assumes either that only half the parents employ predetermination or that the method is

effective only 75% of the time. Model 4 uses different values of method effectiveness for males than for females. Here 71.3% of female-directed efforts are successful, but only 63.7% of the male-directed efforts achieve the desired results. Although these numbers are those previously mentioned for experiments with rabbit semen, they were chosen not because they represented anything in particular, but rather because they are sufficiently different from each other and from 100 that the effects of the difference should be visible in the results. The results are given in Table 3.
The only significant difference from the first model is the shifting of a few children from male to female, as expected. But in model 4, and even in models 2 and 3 if one remembers that male mortality is slightly higher than female mortality at all ages (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1967), there could result an imbalance in the sex ratio in later years which could have noticeable social effects when those children become of marriageable age. Table 5 gives family composition for models 2, 3, and 4. Family composition given by model 2 reflects the rigid assumptions used in construction of that model. Compositions given by models 3 and 4 show the relaxation of that rigidity. Notice that even in model 4, where the sex ratio is less than one, males predominate in the small families, and female predominance becomes evident only as the family size grows. Although a result like this is easily rationalized from the parameters composing the model, it can be difficult to foresee such a result directly from those parameters.
Models 5, 6, and 7 are exactly like models 2, 3, and 4, respectively, when the number of female children in a family is not equal to the number of male children. When those two numbers are equal, the choice of sex for the next child is male, but the effectiveness of that choice still varies

as in the preceding set of models. The results can be found in Table 3. The added bias toward male children in these models results in a much higher sex ratio; but in general the results parallel those given for models 2 , 3 , and 4. Here the gradual lifting of the requirement that there can never be fewer males than females in a given family as one progresses from model 5 to model 7 has an even stronger effect on the sex ratio than the parallel changes in the previous set of models.
As can be seen by examining the compo-

sitions of families in models 5, 6, and 7 as given in Table S, as the rigidity of the model is relaxed and more families without an internal balance in sex ratio are allowed, the distribution of families by composition approaches to some degree the distribution of the first model (Table 4). Also, notice that for model 7, with its unequal efficiencies of predetermination for the two sexes, small families tend to be predominantly male. However, as the families become larger, the lower effectiveness of male-choice compared to that for femalechoice allows the distribution to become more balanced between males and females, although not to the extent of overpowering the bias toward males entirely, at least within the range of the results shown in Table 5.
The important point in the preceding discussion is that the sex ratio can be modified, severely modified for rigid enough assumptions, by the application of sex predetermination. The extent and direction of this modification depends upon exactly how the ability to predetermine sex is applied by the population.
Models 2 through 7 all have approximately the same total number of children as model 1; only the distribution of those children between male and female has been varied from model to model.1 Models 8
1 Summary of basic assumptions of the models: Model 1 assumes birth and death probabilities as in Tables 1 and 2, with a constant 0.5115 probability that any given child will be male. Model 2 is similar to model 1 except that when M = F, the minority sex is chosen with probability 1. Model 3 is like model 2 except that a given child of a chosen sex has 0.75 probability of actually being that sex. Model 4 is like model 2 except that a given child chosen to be male has 0.637 probability of actually being a male; and if chosen to be female, a given child has 0.713 probability of being female. Models 5, 6, and 7 are like models 2, 3, and 4, respectively, except that when M = F the next child is chosen to be male. Model 8 is like model 1 except that the probability that any given child will be male is the same as in Table 6. Models 9, 10, and 11 are like model 8 except that in the first year in any parity class the death

through 11 take a somewhat different approach in that predetermination is used to mold families toward an ideal composition. Here it is assumed that predetermination is 100% effective, and the four probabilities are used to choose which family composition is ideal for that particular family under consideration, to time the arrivals of children and to determine the time of maternal death if it occurs before voluntary exit from the model. The computations are almost identical to those of the previous models, but the interpretation of the computations is slightly different, and that difference is essential.
According to the work of Sheps (1963), if parents desire their family to contain at least B boys and at least G girls, the probability of achieving this with B + G children is at the most about 0.5 when B is equal to G, and it can be much smaller for an unbalanced family. This seems to indicate that family sizes may actually be somewhat larger than desired. Thus, in models 8 through 11, where it is assumed each family can achieve its own desired composition, allowance is made after the birth of each child for voluntary cessation of childbirth.
The "ideal composition" used here is a much modified form of the results of a survey of 283 college students concerning their ideas of ideal family composition and size (Markle and Nam, 1971). Those results were originally reported by giving the total number of students who wanted their «th child to be of a particular sex (or who did not express a preference) for n ranging from 1 to 6. For use here, PI is taken as the appropriate number from Table 1 multiplied by the number of students desiring a male child plus one-half of those expressing no preference, and then
probability from Table 2 has added to it a probability of voluntary cessation of childbirth from Table 6.
