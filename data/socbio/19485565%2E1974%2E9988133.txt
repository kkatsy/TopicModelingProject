There have been many arguments among students of Caribbean and Latin American demography on whether the instability of sexual unions enhances or suppresses fertility. A comparison of various countries reveals that the directions of difference in fertility by type of union often conflict (Miro, 1966). For some populations, fertility is higher for the consensually married (Caracas, Mexico City, and Rio de Janeiro). For others, it is lower (Bogota, San Jose, Buenos Aires). Mortara (1961) finds that differences in proportions of consensual unions among Latin American countries have little explanatory value for intercountry fertility differences. He concludes that no consistent overall fertility differences exist between different types of sexual unions.
In 19SS, Blake hypothesized that the instability of reproductive unions may affect fertility in two opposite ways. On the one hand, it may reduce the rate of reproduction by decreasing the total time of exposure to pregnancy. This reduction is the result of interunion periods of celibacy and periods with infrequent sexual relations as the union is nearing its end. On the other hand, it may increase the rate of reproduc-

tion because there is often a desire to have children born of each new union (Blake, 19SS), or simply because coitus is more frequent at the beginning of each new union.
This hypothesis, if true, may account for the seemingly conflicting results of Miro (1966), Mortara (1961), and others. The net effect of union instability on fertility would be a balance of these two counteracting forces. Although there have been many studies on the subject of union instability in relation to fertility, the two components of instability have never been studied independently. In this paper, we present independent measurements of the effects on fertility of these two components of instability, in order to test a modified form of Blake's hypothesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The source of data for this analysis is the Urban In-Migration and Fertility Survey conducted in Guayaquil, Ecuador, in 1971 (Scrimshaw, 1973). Traditional ethnographic research preceded and contributed to the design and testing of questionnaires for a survey of approximately two thousand urban families in the lower socioeconomic stratum. Although moderate vari-

ations exist in the income level, education, housing, etc., generally speaking, it is a relatively homogeneous sample.
The data from the survey include information from a probability cluster sample of women, ages IS to 49, single and married, concerning their reproductive history, sexual union history, employment history, knowledge, attitude and use of contraceptives, nutrition and beliefs about food, and migration history for urban in-migrants. The survey also collected similar information from men currently involved in a sexual union with a woman in the sample. Of particular importance to the present study, the survey obtained complete sexual-union histories of all women and men in the sample, including data on the dates of the initiation and dissolution of all their sexual unions as well as number of children born in each union. Our analysis was confined to the subsample of women who were currently in a sexual union at the time of the survey, and their spouses, if interviewed.
In previous studies on this subject, differential stability was frequently measured by the type of current union: legal marriages were considered the most stable; common-law unions were considered less stable; and, visiting relations were considered the least stable (Stycos, 1955; Onaka and Yaukey, 1973). There are several limitations in using type of union to indicate union stability.
Usually the data differentiate between legal, common law, and visiting relations only for the person's most recent sexual union. Thus, a woman who entered more than one union is placed in the consensualunion category if her last union was consensual even though her preceding union may have been legal. In fact, a number of studies have indicated that an adult may typically pass through three types of mating relationships: visiting, common law, and marriage (Nag, 1971; Yaukey and

Thorsen, 1972). Thus, a person classified as married may have gone through a number of sexual unions and suffered from significant loss in reproductive time. Therefore, it would be misleading to study the fertility differentials among the three types of union and draw inferences on the relationship between union stability and fertility.
In the present study, we consider a person's mating career as less stable if she (he) passes through many unions in her (his) lifetime and suffers from heavy loss in reproductive time. Hence, we measure the stability of unions by the number of unions a person has had and by the years of reproductive time he or she has lost. If Blake's hypothesis is true, we expect that (1) among people who have had the same number of unions, those who experienced more loss in reproductive time will have a lower fertility; and (2) among people who have lost the same amount of reproductive time, those who entered more unions have a higher fertility.
Fertility is measured by the number of children ever born and children ever fathered for women and men respectively. Since members of the study population are all currently in union, those who had been in only one union by definition have been in an uninterrupted union and hence have had no loss in reproductive time. Among those who have ever had two unions, a sizable portion entered the second union in the same year the first union dissolved. Their interunion time loss was negligible (less than one year).
People who have had two unions suffered from an interunion reproductive time lost. The effect of such a loss on fertility obviously is strongly linked to when the loss occurred. A one-year loss at the age of 20 may have the similar effect on fertility as a three-year loss which occurred at the age of 35, depending on the age-specific marital

for a 40-year-old woman, loss of one year at the age of 19 would give hera weighted loss of oneyear; loss of oneyear at the age of 26 would give her a weighted loss of 0.78 year.
The interval between marriage and the first birth is considerably shorter than the intervals between subsequent births. Reproductive time lost occurs after the first union, and on the average, after the first birth. Hence it is the interval for subsequent births that we should apply. Knowing the proportion of first births among women at different age groups, we were able to remove the disturbing effect of the uneven distribution of first births on agespecific marital fertility before we constructed the weights (Wolfers, 1974).
A small number of people professed to have had three or more unions. They are excluded from Tables 2 and 3 since there are not enough cases for the breakdown required. Seven per cent of the meninthe

sample have had more than one union concurrently in their lives. These polygynous men are also excluded from our analysis of union stability and fertility, because for them the multiplicity of unions has a different meaning and impact on the reproductive behavior.
RESULTS
Tables 2 and 3 show the fertility of Ecuadorian men and women by the number of sexual unions they have had and by the weighted years of reproductive time lost. All the tabulations are controlled for the number of years elapsed since a person entered into the first sexual union, which we shall call the "alliance span." All the averages of children ever born are standardized by the alliance-span composition of the population in order to remove its possible effect on fertility.
People with one union, who by definition have no loss in reproductive time, are com-

pared with people with two unions and negligible loss in reproductive time (less than one year). Our assumption is that the difference in fertility between these two groups is due to the number of unions they have had. The first column in Table 2 shows that the average number of children a man has is increased by 0.5 children (from 4.6 to S.I) when a second union is formed. Controlling for the loss in reproductive time and the alliance span, one additional union brought the fertility up 11.2 per cent. The experience of women is somewhat different from that of the men (Table 3, Column 1). Fertility is not significantly different between those with one union and those with two. The average number of children born is 4.66 for the former, and 4.5 for the latter.
Another attempt is made at examining the impact of additional unions on fertility. Men and women are grouped by the total number of years they have spent in sexual

unions (alliance span minus interunion waiting time) and by the number of unions they have had. Table 4 shows that when the duration of pregnancy exposure is controlled, the first additional union increases the average number of children ever born by 14 per cent (or O.S children). The subsequent additions increase the fertility by 15-16 per cent (or 0.6 children). The remarkable consistency between male and female data lends us confidence in our conclusion that there is a positive relation between fertility and the number of unions a person has had when the duration of pregnancy exposure is controlled.
To analyze the relationship between fertility and reproductive time lost, we have limited our observations to men and women with two sexual unions only, since all those with one union have not suffered any reproductive time lost. The lower half of Table 2 shows that among the men with two unions, increasing reproductive time lost consistently has a negative effect on fer-

tility. Those losing less than one year, 1-3 years, and 3-6 years of their reproductive time have an average number of 5.1,4.S, and 3.7 children, respectively. Therefore, for every weighted year of loss in reproductive time, there is an average loss of 0.35 children. These data seem to suggest that factors leading to increased fertility when new unions are formed could compensate approximately 1.4 years loss in reproductive time for the Ecuadorian men.
This relationship between fertility and reproductive time lost among the female population is not clearly observed. While there is a negative correlation between reproductive time lost and number of children born among the high-loss groups, such a correlation does not appear among women who suffered little loss in reproductive time. Women with 1-3 years of loss have 5.2 children, which is 0.7 children more than women with negligible loss in reproductive time (Table 3). We find no single satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Union instability manifests itself through increased reproductive time lost and a greater number of unions entered into by an individual during the course of a lifetime. We have examined independently the impact of each of these factors on fertility in Guayaquil, Ecuador.
When we control for the number of unions, we find among men a negative correlation between fertility and years of reproductive time lost. However, the evidence among the female population is not conclusive. Women with less than one year of loss have 0.7 children fewer than women with 1-3 years of loss. This is a significant difference which cannot be explained by sampling error. One possible explanation lies in the possibility that women with time loss of less than one year stayed in an unhappy union, toward the end of which sexual intercourse had become infrequent, until they were ready to enter another union. As our data show, the fertility rate per exposure year during the first union (births divided by the duration of that union) is significantly lower among these women than the rate among those women who have lost more reproductive time.
When we control for years spent in union (Table 4), people who have had two unions have a fertility 14 per cent higher than those who have had only one. People who have had three or more unions have a fertility 15 per cent higher than those who have had two. Similar results are observed among both the male and female populations. These findings support the hypothesis that multiplicity of sexual unions has a positive effect on fertility.
The multiplicity of unions would have a positive effect on fertility if there is a desire for children in each new union. Insofar as the Ecuadorian man desires any of the rewards for parenthood, he must have children in his present union because the chil-

dren born in past unions are normally not attached to him. Although the law requires economic responsibility for all children, including those from a previous union, men sometimes evade this by deserting their mates. They do not experience the pressure of too many offspring as frequently as women do. Because they do not wish to be childless, and because children are a convenient and effective means of assuring a woman's fidelity and dependence, men tend to desire children in the current union.
Women also view offspring as a means for promoting constancy and fidelity in their spouses. However, the desire for children in the current union seems to be stronger among men and is initiated by them. After the dissolution of unions, women have to worry more about the financial burden of childrearing. Therefore, it is not surprising that they are more in favor of family limitation than men; their desired family size is smaller than that of men, and a larger proportion of them wished they had had fewer children (Scrimshaw 1973). However, they do have to accommodate themselves to the men's desire for children and comply with it, since women are by no means independent of men for support and status (see Blake, 1961 for a similar situation in Jamaica).
However, the effect of a desire for children on fertility is potential rather than actual. If women in the study population habitually used contraception or abortion, the wish to have children in each new union would tend to increase fertility. If contraception or abortion was not widely practiced, the role of multiple unions in bringing about such a result may be quite limited. It is necessary for us to examine the prevalence of these practices in the study population.
Five per cent of the women admitted to having had induced abortions. A quarter of the women are currently using some
