ABSTRACT:Child mortality experience may affect subsequent fertility of couples by exerting the so-called "physiological" and/or "replacement" responses. The influence of either effect should become apparent upon an examination of individual reproductive histories. The impact of infant and early childhood mortality on subsequent reproductive behavior of couples is analyzed for the presence and intensity of these effects. Historical data are derived from 1,261 families in two communities in western Massachusetts. Relationships of intervals between successive confinements, and parity progression ratios, according to the fate of previous births, are examined. While forms of family limitation have been employed by the study population, indicating that the capacity for replacement existed, the data do not reveal any significant attempt at child replacement.

pothesis for Deerfield and Shelburne families during the time of fertility transition in these communities. Furthermore, it is difficult to clearly identify the influence of mortality on fertility in the presence of other, perhaps confounding, factors. It is conceivable that in some cases those who experienced child loss cannot, rather than do not wish to, replace that loss. Maternal physiological resources expended on each child are likely to be gravidity and age dependent. Both factors may not only affect child survival but may effectively diminish subsequent fecundity and fertility.
A number of other conditions may account for the observed lack of child replacement effect. First, in populations undergoing fertility transition with rather imperfect contraceptive technology, as was the case with the study population, parents may still expect to bear more than the "desired" number of offspring. Second, preference for the sex of children should effectively weaken the overall replacement effect since the death of a child of "undesired" sex will not be replaced (Preston, 1978). Any behavior in pursuit of a particular sex would have to be quite strong to result in a demonstrable demographic effect (Knodel and De Vos, 1980). Based on the sex ratio of last births and on parity progression ratios, there is some indication of preference for males in Deerfield but not in Shelburne. Given small sample sizes in categories with child deaths, rather weak indications of sex preference, and no support for the child replacement hypothesis it seems unlikely that further investigation of replacement by sex of child would yield additional information. Third, replacement need not be an immediate and full response to a loss but an incomplete response which occurs at the very end of the childbearing cycle.

Although this paper has shed some light on the observable patterns present in nineteenth-century New England, the precise relationship between fertility and child mortality remain far from clear. Past assumptions have usually included the notion that infant mortality was to be avoided at all costs and that in populations where high fertility is either valued and/or unavoided, the act of reproductive compensation for a loss would be very common. It appears that while child replacement may be present in some societies, it is relatively inefficient and perhaps infrequent (Preston, 1978, pp. 11-12).
To these concerns we must add the more important observation made by Scrimshaw (1978), Polgar (1972), and others, regarding the fact that in many high fertility-high mortality situations the parents stoically "permit" or even contribute to a certain fraction of avoidable infant mortality. This is a marked distinction from simply expecting some infant deaths to occur.
If nothing else, the lesson from traditional societies at this point, whether they are historical or contemporary, is that parents are not passive participants in a natural regime of births and deaths. The Deerfield and Shelburne inhabitants were actively participating in fertility reduction, and to the extent that child replacement was desired, some compensation was certainly possible. The results of this study do not indicate that child replacement was practiced to any significant degree.
