The assessment of racial differences in perceptual phenomena has been largely limited to traits for which a genetic mechanism has been demonstrated or to those for which a substantial cultural component might be expected (Spuhler and Lindzey, 1967). However, this approach has rarely been employed as a first step in the study of the genetic determinants of individual differences in behavioral traits. The strength of this approach rests on the assumption "that as a consequence of the manifold genetic differences among human populations there will be average differences for any kind of trait that has at least in part a genetic basis" (Mayr, 1963). Studies based on a similar rationale, utilizing inbred and selected strains of mice, have contributed significantly to the understanding of genetic determinants of the behavior of that species (McClearn, 1970).
Since race and culture are inextricably confounded in human populations, Spuhler and Lindzey (1967) have suggested that the study of racial differences in behavioral traits might most profitably be pursued through the study of basic processes. Here, cultural differences might be expected to be less seriously confounded. The robustness of the findings of population differences for

perceptual traits previously investigated-- taste sensitivity to PTC, and incidence of color blindness--suggests that the study of racial differences in other basic perceptual processes might prove a valuable tool in determining the possibility of genetic involvement. The basic processes studied in the area of perception and psychophysics, where reports of individual differences are often relegated to footnote comments, provide the behavioral geneticist with a wide variety of accurately measurable phenotypes for investigation.
In this area, critical-flicker-frequency (CFF), as measured by the frequency at which a flickering light appears to fuse, has been studied as the prototypic measure of the eye's capacity for temporal resolution for over two hundred years (Landis, 1953). Recent evidence suggests that the temporal resolution of the visual system is frequency dependent, and more than a single process may be involved (deLange, 1952, 1954; Kelly, 19616, 1969). The major changes in methodology which led to these discoveries were (a) the use of frequency as an independent variable, and (fi) the measurement of sensitivity as the reciprocal of the modulation amplitude, m, of the stimulus field which is required for flicker to be per-

ceived. Classical CFF is therefore the special case of sensitivity obtained with 100% modulation amplitude.
Employing these methods at a variety of frequencies, individual differences were noted in the sensitivity curves, obtained by plotting m~1 as a function of frequency, by both deLange (19S8) and Kelly (1962). In addition, the individual differences demonstrated by Kelly were relatively stable within individuals and varied considerably among individuals. These latter conditions suggest the possibility of genetic involvement in the determination of sensitivity to nickering light. This possibility is further supported by Murawski's (1960) findings that CFF obtained from four pairs of identical twins showed closer agreement than those of unrelated individuals.
The objectives of this research were twofold: (a) to determine the extent of individual differences in the ability to detect flicker in a sinusoidally modulated stimulus at each of five frequencies and for CFF, and (b) to determine whether population differences might account for a significant proportion of the observed variability.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects were twelve males and twelve females from each of four racial groups (Caucasian, Chinese, Japanese and PartHawaiian), students enrolled in introductory psychology at the University of Hawaii. Each subject reported the racial background of each of his grandparents. In addition, each was asked to report whether the dominant culture in his home was Chinese, Hawaiian, Japanese, American, or a combination of any two.
The optical design of the stimulus generator was based on that reported by Kelly (1961a) and produced a 25° circular "edgeless field," with a luminance of approximately two millilamberts at its center, through the mixture of two beams of white

light from a single source. The beams were polarized at right angles to each other, and one was sinusoidally modulated through the introduction of a rotating polarizing filter. By rotation of an analyzer placed in the final compound beam, the relative proportion of light contributed by each beam could be varied continuously while maintaining constant average luminance. The stimulus was projected on a piece of ground glass and was viewed from the opposite side through an artificial pupil, l.SS mm. in diameter. The temporal characteristics of the sinusoidally modulated field, showing luminance as a function of time, are presented in Figure 1.
A single staircase procedure for threshold determination was used. Each subject was presented 20 one-second trials at each of five frequencies: 18, 14, 10, 2, and 30 Hz., in that order. Between trials, the stimulus was constant and of the same time average luminance as the test stimulus. Subjects were asked to report whether the stimulus was constant or flickering during each trial, and modulation amplitude was varied from trial to trial. A report of "flicker" led to a decrease in modulation amplitude on the following trial while a report of "constant" led to an increase in modulation amplitude. Forty values of modulation amplitude, selected to approximate a logarithmic scale, were used. The threshold value was defined as that selected value above and below which 50% of the "flicker" responses on the last 14 trials occurred. Finally, CFF was determined by increasing modulation amplitude to 100% and varying frequency in 0.5 Hz. steps over the final 14 of 20 trials presented as above. All subjects except those who wore contact lenses were tested with uncorrected vision using the dominant eye.
The logarithmic relationship between stimulus intensity and threshold value, generally demonstrated for a wide variety

Thus, all values were subjected to logarithmic transformation, prior to analysis. All data were corrected for regression of sensitivity on visual acuity, and values obtained at frequencies above 10Hz.

race, and on culture are presented in Table 4. The extent to which culture is able to account for variance, over and above that accounted for by race, can be estimated by subtraction of the second value from the first. Similarly, to estimate the contribution of race, independent of culture, the third value is subtracted from the first (Cohen, 1968). These differences and their significance values are also presented in Table 4. This analysis indicates that culture can account for from 4% to 8% of the variance over and above that accounted for by race alone. The variance accounted for by race, independent of culture, does not differ significantly from zero.

DISCUSSION
The results of this research suggest that the search for genetic determinants of individual differences in sensitivity to flickering light might be pursued most profitably through the comparison of members of the Chinese and Caucasian races and their crosses for each of the three measures of sensitivity. From the regression analyses, it might be argued that environmental variables have a significant effect on these dependent measures. However, race and culture are inextricably confounded, and this argument implicitly assumes that cultural differences are determined entirely by environmental variables. In point of fact,

cultural differences may also be a function of heritable differences.
SUMMARY The comparison of members of four populations on three measures of sensitivity

to flickering light suggests the possibility of genetic involvement in observed differences. Evidence consistent with a hypothesis that sensitivity at high and at low frequencies is under the control of independent mechanisms was also found.
