In a previous paper by this title (Post, 1966) deformities of the nasal septum were described and classified. Two studies of the frequencies of deformities in twins were reviewed, both yielding higher rates of concordance between identical pairs than between fraternal pairs, with resulting "heritability estimates" of 0.4 and 0.6; and the frequencies of normal and abnormal septa were reported in samples of skulls from 22 populations, aggregating 2,343 individuals. Six of the skull samples were from populations described as "long civilized"--two of Chinese, two of recent Egyptians, and two of Europeans. Most of the sixteen other samples were from simple paleolithic cultures of hunters and food gatherers. The former group of samples is contrasted with the latter, on the whole, in having higher frequencies of deformed septa, particularly of "marked" or exaggerated deformities. Moreover, the relatively few skulls with deformities classified as "very marked" are almost all confined to the "long civilized" group of samples.
Discussion of possible explanations of the contrast in frequency of septal deformities between the two groups of samples led to the hypothesis that maladaptations with ge-

netic components--always in a state of equilibrium between input flow (from mutations) and selection--have not been eliminated from post-paleolithic populations as effectively as from populations of more simple habitats, due to a partial relaxation of the rigors of natural selection concomitant with the growth of culture.
The present paper comments on the ontogeny and typology of septal deformities, summarizes additional family studies, and presents data on the frequencies of septal deformities in samples of skulls from four additional populations: contemporary American colored and white, neolithic (late Stone Age) white, and fairly recent Eskimo. All four are subdivided by sex; all but the Eskimo are also subdivided by age, in five-year classes. The samples of contemporary American colored and white are further classified and analyzed by several morphological observations and measurements including bilateral asymmetry, trauma, dental malocclusion, and associated abnormalities. The neolithic skulls provide a test of the hypothesis of relaxed selection by comparison of the frequencies of septal deformities among contemporary whites with the frequencies among their ancestors some four to five thousand years ago.

ONTOGENY AND TYPOLOGY OF SEPTAL
DEFORMITIES
The septal cartilage is a continuation into adult life of the fetal or "primitive" septal cartilage. All but the anterior part of this cartilage disappears during early childhood as the left and right lamellae of the perpendicular plates of the vomer become ossified. The part of the septal cartilage which lies between the lamellae is then absorbed, allowing the left and right membrane bones to fuse, forming the septum of the adult skull. Details are given in Hillenbrand (1933). Evidence of the bilateral origin of the vomer is demonstrated by the two alae and the intervening groove, which forms the superior

margin of the vomer, and into which the septal cartilage fits. The anterior part of the septum, which remains cartilaginous throughout life, is almost never preserved in adult skulls, whether disinterred or macerated.
The most frequent type of deformity in adult skulls is a "shelf" or "ledge" of bone projecting laterally and horizontally from either the left or right side of the groove which contains the septal nerve and accompanying vessels. Viewed from the front of the skull, looking slightly downward into the nasal orifice, the groove appears widest at its anterior end, that is, the one closest to the nasal spine. Posteriorly it tapers, to

become fairly narrow at about one-quarter to one-half, occasionally to three-quarters, of its length, along the superior margin of the vomer (Figs. 1 and 2). In the living, the inferior margin of the septal cartilage lies in and extends upward (anteriorly) from this groove. Representing the groove in crosssection as a capital Y with very short, thin, and cup-shaped arms, concave surfaces

directed upward and facing each other, the deformity consists of one arm being longer than the other and bent downward to become almost horizontal, intruding into the nares. The resulting obstruction may impede air flow on that side (Figs. 3 and 4). This deformity usually produces a bending, bowing, warping, or buckling of the septum, which impedes air flow even more.

In the second most frequent type of deformity, the lateral and horizontal projection of one of the arms of the Y-shaped groove is restricted to a rather obtuse point, forming what is often called a "spur." A large spur may protrude as much as a centi-

meter, or even more, into the air passage. The profile of the spur, if it could be viewed in the sagittal plane of the skull from below looking upward vertically, would appear as a gently sloping hillock, becoming steeper near the summit, the anterior slope always

Gross deviation into the left nasal passage is maximal in 3; it forms a typical spur in 4. Ethmoid bone is above the spur; vomer, below it.

HEREDITY AND ETIOLOGY

(Fig. 5). Continuing the simile of a hillock, a spur
viewed from this aspect might be called a pointed, steep hillock; a "ledge" or "shelf," a longer, more gently sloping one. When viewed at right angles to this aspect but again in the sagittal plane, that is, looking into the nasal orifice full face, a spur can hardly be distinguished from a ledge. From this aspect the septum usually appears

Two reports of almost identical deformities of the nasal septum in pairs of allegedly monozygotic twins may be added to the studies summarized in the previous paper, those of Schwarz (1928) on 84 twin pairs and Schnitzler (1933) on 61. Howie (1946) describes cases of gross, severe septal deformities which were indistinguishable in male twins aged 22. Reid (1946) describes a

bowed or warped, with the deformity on

the convex surface. The ethmoidal region of

the septum lies above the hillock, the vomer-

ine region below it.

A third type of abnormal ossification,

rather rare, is a spur arising from one or the

other of the very shallow bilateral grooves

of the ethmoid which contain the left and

right spheno-palatine (naso-palatine) nerves

and companion vessels. Such a spur lies

slightly above the position of the first and

second types of abnormality.

In all three types, the bone of the summit

of the hillock is thickened, suggesting that

it may contain an accessory ossification cen-

ter, or, probably more likely, that the ossifi-

cation center of childhood may have become

abnormally overactive. The bony surface of

the septum is apt to be considerably rougher

on the convex than on the concave side,

which is usually notably smooth. Occasionally in types one and two there
is a "crater" at the summit of the hillock. The crater is rather circular in a spur, elongate or oval-shaped in a shelf. This crater is

type of deformity was the ridge or ledge-like form. Bending or buckling of the septum without ridge, ledge, spur, or process was rare.
Additional reports have been found which attribute most septal deformities to what might be termed constitutional or developmental factors. Hillenbrand (1933) concludes that septal deformities result from maldevelopment of the vomer. Jackson and Jackson (1959, p. 38-39) and Klaff (1956) assert that the great majority seem to be developmental. Zuckerkandl (1882) explains almost all cases by irregular growth of either the left or right lamellae of the perpendicu-

lar plates of the vomer, or, more rarely, of the ethmoid, a conclusion with which the present observations are in agreement.

death, cause of death, often a photograph of the cadaver, and various clinical and anthropological notes. All skulls of individuals under the age of 50 and over the age of 60 were included, to give maximum contrast between prime of life and older age, provided they had sufficient teeth to permit observations on dental occlusion. American colored female skulls were too few to warrant reporting. Total numbers examined, including those with damaged septa, were: white males, 183; white females, 88; and colored males, 169.
European neolithic. Two hundred skulls in three neolithic areas of Western and one of Central Europe are reported as one series since area frequencies of septal abnormalities are indistinguishable.
Neolithic of Egypt. Sixty-nine skulls from three neolithic sites of Egypt were examined at the Department of Anatomy and Histology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cairo: (a) Archaic, from Kostal (Quostol), Nubia, near the border of Sudan, a pastoral culture with some agriculture, about 2000 B.C. (14 skulls); (b) Badarian, from the Nile banks near Asyat, aneolithic (some copper artifacts), about 3500 B.c. (22 skulls); (c) Early Predynastic (33 skulls). Skulls of the first and third groups are usually large and dolichocephalic with highbridged noses and no evidence of Negroid admixture like that observed in nearly all of the Badarian skulls. Sex was noted as marked on the skull, in all cases acceptable. The Egyptian skulls are reported as one series, as are the European neolithic skulls, since the three subsamples are indistinguishable in the frequency of septal abnormalities.
Eskimo. Forty-eight male and thirtyseven female Eskimo skulls were examined in the large collections at the U.S. National Museum in Washington. They are from western Alaska--St. Lawrence Island, the Seward Peninsula, Golofin Bay, Norton

Bay, and Point Hope, in approximately equal numbers.
The procedure and standards of classification into four classes, described previously (Post, 1966), were followed for deformities of the inferior osseous (vomerine) and superior osseous (sphenoid) regions of the septum, namely: normal and slightly, markedly, and very markedly abnormal. Observations of the cartilaginous region were discontinued. Data on normal and abnormal septa in the above-described populations are given in Tables 1, 2, and 3.
A test sample of sixty-two skulls which had been classified two years previously was examined anew and reclassified in all three regions with only 4% error.
POPULATION COMPARISONS
Comparisons in the frequencies of septal deformities between population samples of the present study and those reported in the previous paper (Post, 1966, Tables 2 and 3) require pooling of the sexes, since sex was not designated in the latter. The sexes are fairly equally represented except for the American colored, which are all male. The percentages of deformed septa, in ascending order, are shown in Table 4.
These frequencies are fairly consistent with the previous frequencies, as shown in Table 5 by the selections of samples from Tables 2 and 3 of the earlier study. Scanning the data from both present and previous compilations, Eskimos have the lowest rates of abnormal septa; contemporary American whites and Europeans, the highest. American colored are intermediary, as are European and Egyptian neolithics.
The numbers and frequencies of deformities (three classes) in the samples of five populations here reported for the first time, subdivided by sex, are presented in summary form in Table 1. Details of the present samples of contemporary American colored and white are presented and discussed be-

low. Data on the European neolithic samples, subdivided by sex, age and locality, are presented in Table 2.
To these data may be added the results of recent examinations of overall septal deformity in any region (see Table 6). While not directly comparable with the above, since many skulls are deformed in both vomerine and ethmoidal regions, they contribute toward establishing the dichotomy of "civilized" versus "primitives." The skulls were examined in the American Museum of Natural History, New York. They are presented more fully in Table 3.
Although population differences are distinguished clearly by these data, no statistics can reflect their full dimensions and depth. By examining the septa of any two of these population samples together, or in immediate sequence, one ascertains a still

greater magnitude of population difference. The most distinctive septa are those of the Eskimos and Aleuts, with extremely rare deformities, all of the lowest degree. Their regularity of form is striking, to the point of monotony. In greatest contrast are the septa of contemporary whites, whether European or American, almost all misformed to at least a tiny degree, insufficient for recording. They exhibit the highest frequencies of "slightly abnormal" deformities, with unrivalled frequencies of "very marked" cases. But again, no statistics could reflect the enormous variety of the deformities, their bizarre and grotesque natures, each form unique, yet all so obviously without function. Other populations are intermediary between these two extremes, the American Indians being closer to the Eskimo and Aleuts, with relatively rare and moderate

deformities, while the American colored are closer to the whites.
Four references from medical literature to racial differences in the frequency of septal deformities may be added to those cited in the previous paper. Ballenger (1959, p. 38) notes that septal deformities are less frequent among Negroes than whites. Keogh (1952, p. 90) asserts that "most writers agree that deflection of the nasal septum is commoner in civilized peoples than in savage races." Zuckerkandl (1892)

comments on their relative infrequency among non-European races. St. Clair Thomson (1926) estimates frequencies of 75% among Europeans, contrasted with great rarity among "primitives," including notably the "red" (American) Indian. The last two authors interpret this contrast as evidence against the trauma theory of the origin of septal deformities. One of the studies mentioned previously should be cited again. Talbot (1894, p. 251-293) examined 7,600 British skulls, of which 5,762 (76%) showed marked septal deformities; among 687 ancient Peruvian skulls only 147 possessed deformed nasal septa (21%).
ASSOCIATED ABNORMALITIES AND FEATURES
Questions have arisen about possible associations between septal abnormalities

and other abnormalities of the face or crani-
um that might provide clues for explaining
their basic origins. Therefore, each of the
macerated skulls from the Washington
University collection was inspected and
scored for evidence of trauma (1), asymme-
try in three regions (2-4), and any other
type of osteological abnormality observed in
the face or nasal aperture (5). Four anthro-
pomжtrie measurements were made: upper
facial height; nasal length; diameter and
length of tear duct (lacrimal canal), right
side only (6-9). Skulls were also examined
and classified for three anatomical features
(traits) which vary widely, usually within
normal limits, but occasionally exceed these
limits sufficiently to be considered abnormal
(10-12) ; and for six features under the ru-
bric "dental occlusion" (13-18). These 18
features were selected as possible sources of
clues for suggesting explanations of the
causes of septal deformities. They were
selected, after consultation, from sources
which included medical literature and com-
ments received from readers of the previous
paper.
1. Trauma--of any bone of the face. 2-4. Asymmetry--scored separately for
(a) nasal sill; (b) sides of nasal aperture; (c) nasal bones. 5. Additional osteological abnormality, if any observed. 6. Upper facial height (nasion to prosthion). 7.

Skulls were scored for these abnormalities at the same time as for septal abnormalities. About 10% were scored a second time, at separate sessions, as spot tests of accuracy. The four anthropomжtrie measurements and scores for observations on palate height and molar malocclusion were found to be quite accurate, as might be expected, since maxillary and mandibular molars can be juxtaposed with precision in the skull. If too many teeth were missing to permit reasonable certainty, the skull was bypassed. Scores for asymmetry and trauma were least accurate, but not unsatisfactorily so. Four categories were employed in scoring: normal and slightly, markedly, and very markedly abnormal.
Association tables were made for the purpose of comparing the variation data for each of these eighteen features (traits) with those for the four classes of septal normality or abnormality. Vomer and ethmoid were scored separately. Association tables were made for each of the following five subsamples, distinct in race, sex and age, viz:
o) 102 colored males, 15-40 ("younger"); b) 67 colored males, 60 and over ("older") ; c) 88 white females, 25-50 and over ("older") ; d) 93 white males, 15-50 ("younger") ; e) 90 white males, 60 and over ("older").

In conclusion, since no other explanation has been found for septal deformities, they are tentatively attributed to excessive ossification of one or the other of the paired lamellae of the vomer, or, occasionally, of the ethmoid. This is believed to produce the bowing or deviation of the septum, which in the living is almost always more clearly manifest than the ridge or spur itself, but which usually is secondary to it. The primary abnormality is best observed in skulls. The basic cause is genetic control--or malcontrol--of ossification.
Additional material for a small side study of the relationship between septal abnormality and malocclusion of molar teeth was

Of the 180 resulting tables (18 X 2 X 5), only one showed an association of statistical significance--that between vomer and facial asymmetry among "younger" white males. The results of combining the three classes of facial asymmetry into one class are shown in Table 7. In the remaining 179 tables no association was revealed greater than might be expected by chance alone. Pooling of any two or more of the five subsamples would not be justified since they are not homogeneous, due to differences of age, sex, or race. Examination of the individual skulls which exhibited septal deformity together with another abnormality or extreme variation was unavailing.

obtained from frontal head radiographs of Japanese children fully described and reported by Schull and Neel (1965). Complete records of the material, stored at the Department of Human Genetics of the University of Michigan, were kindly made available by these authors. Septal abnormalities were appraised subjectively from the radiographs, with the same criteria and definitions as for the skull (Post, 1966, p. 102, 104), by the amount of protrusion into or blocking of the left or right air passage due to a ridge or spur of bone, disregarding abnormalities of soft tissue. Septa were classified as normal, possibly abnormal, or decidedly abnormal. Among the 356

cephalograms examined, all of children aged 10 and 11, only 36 (10%) were placed in the last category. This frequency of decidedly abnormal septa is lower than expected from skull samples of adult Caucasians, most of whose frequencies are over twice as high. The difference is attributable partly to the limitations of X-ray photography, possibly also to racial differentiation, but mostly to the subjects' immaturity, since ossification of the vomer is not complete until puberty.

quencies of deformed septa rose from 23% under age 5 to 53% at ages 10-20, and to 85% at ages over 25 (see Table 8).
Ali (1965) attributes septal deformity to developmental factors and comments on their tendency to be familial. It is clear from his results that observations of septal deformity should include record of age. Ali found no sex difference in their frequency, and he makes no comment on the bilateral differences which he reports (see Table 9). I t would appear from this study that age is an important factor through early adult years, but much less important beyond the third decade.
In the present study, age differences in the frequencies of septal deformities could be estimated only among the contemporary male skulls, since too few female skulls of
TABLE 9
BILATERAL DIFFERENCES IN SEPTAL DEFORMITIES I N AN IRAQI POPULATION*

Among the 36 children with decidedly abnormal septa, 31 or 86% had normal molar occlusion, as determined by direct examination. In contrast, among 2,911 children whose parents were not related, pooling the sexes and including cases of abnormal and normal septa (which were not examined), 1,252 or 43% had normal occlusion (Schull and Neel 1965, p. 231, Table 10.2). These results do not indicate an association between septal abnormality and dental malocclusion.
DIFFERENCES OF AGE, SEX, RACE, AND ANTIQUITY
Increased frequency of septal deformities with age has been demonstrated by Ali (1965). School children, students of various ages, and adults (all patients in Iraqi clinics) were examined by anterior rhinoscopy as part of ear, nose, and throat procedure, excluding cases of diseased patients.

older age were available and the age estimates of neolithic skulls are not exact. Comparisons between the frequencies of "older" (60 and over) and "younger" skulls (15-40 for American colored males and 15-50 for American white males) give conflicting results as can be seen in Table 10. The differences are small, and even the largest difference (5.9%) is of no statistical significance. Males have a slightly higher frequency of deformities than females in all three comparisons (Table 11).

Race difference is marked. The American colored male skulls have lower frequencies of deformities than the American whites, at both age levels (see Table 12;.
Neolithic skulls have clearly lower frequencies than modern American skulls of corresponding sex. The Egyptian neolithic skulls were too few in number to justify making estimates of statistical significance, but the differences are sizable (see Table 13).

Neolithic skulls of northwestern Europe present a slightly less marked contrast with contemporary skulls than do the Egyptian neolithic samples, but the differences are statistically significant at the 0.001 level for both vomerine and ethmoidal regions of the septum, in both sexes, as shown in Tables 14 and 15.
The lower frequencies of septal deformities about four or five thousand years ago (some 160 to 200 generations) in an ancestral population is noteworthy, representing very rapid change.

DISCUSSION
The relaxed selection hypothesis arose from population comparisons, as described earlier. Among "primitive" populations, septal deformities of the skull are rare, under 18% (in the inferior osseous region, or vomer). There are three exceptions: 72 Dakota Indians, 36%; 77 Illinois Indians, 27%; 27 Australian aborigines, 26%. In contrast, 27% to 67% of "long civilized" samples are deformed. Males have higher rates than females, and older age is a factor. I t is believed that all the samples represent septal defect fairly, without selectivity, since persons who died from or with septal defects have never been buried separately from others. All are believed to have little or no white ancestry, and to reflect "primitive" diet.
The hypothesis comes to mind also from clinical observations. A typical listing and classification of symptoms of deformed septa is found in Heatley (1937): (a) mild deformity--no symptom; (b) marked deformity--vasomotor disturbances, frequent colds, low catarrh, either chronic or recurrent, which often leads to otitis media, tinnitis, loss of hearing, and perhaps to a loss of sense of balance; (c) severe deformity--any of the above to elevated degrees, plus chronic mouth breathing, which diminishes the efficiency of the nose in warming and moistening inhaled air. This in turn leads to a less than normally moistened pharynx, producing recurrent infections of the throat and sinuses, frequently with diminished acuity of taste and smell.
The selective disadvantage of chronic mouth breathing is effectively demonstrated by subjects on all-day hikes, even at leisurely paces. If hurried, such as by fear of hunger or enemies, on flights of several days-- not unusual for paleolithic people--the results can be easily imagined. Short sprints are of course a minor consideration. The penalties of mouth breathing become acute
