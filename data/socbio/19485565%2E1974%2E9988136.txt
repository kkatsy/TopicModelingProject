Our oldest historical records document that man has been persistent in his attempts to unravel the mystery of human sex determination (Cederqvist and Fuchs, 1970). Sincere, well-meaning philosophers and medical researchers have presented a myriad of "critical" factors which they felt could have a preconception influence on the sex of a child. Everything from lunar forces to autosuggestion to aperitifs of wine and lion's blood have at some point held the spotlight as the most effective means of preselecting the conception of either a son or a daughter.
In addition, since the time of Hippocrates, there has been support for the hypothesis that the timing of intercourse within the menstrual cycle is an important variable in determining the sex of the forthcoming child. However, the early insemination timing theories were not well grounded in the facts of human reproduction and the physiology of sex determination. They revolved around the belief that menstruation and ovulation occurred simultaneously; that is, that human females, just as lower animals experienced vaginal bleeding at the time of maximum fertility.

Even among those guided by these similar, although incorrect, views about reproductive processes, there was no agreement as to which portion of the cycle favored male or female conceptions.
What follows is a review of the various historical hypotheses that linked human sex ratio to cycle day of insemination and a presentation of the conclusions of the most recent research in this area.
FOSTMENSTRUAL INSEMINATION
Hippocrates was possibly the first to present the argument that male births were most likely to result from coitus in the immediate postmenstrual period. According, to Guillemeau (cited in Guttmacher, 1935, p. 162):
Hippocrates writes in his booke (concerning superfoetation) of the means how to get man or woman childe. Hee that will beget a son must know his wife as soon as her courses are staved, and then try to the utmost of his strength; but if hee desire to get a daughter, hee must company with his wife a good while after her courses or at the time when she hath them.
During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a number of researchers, some of whom determined coital dates

by ascertaining when their subjects' soldier husbands were home on leave, presented data which supported Hippocrates' hypothesis. As indicated in Table 1, the per-

ones, favored male conceptions. Dechman and Tucker based their timing advice on variations of the "parental strength" theory of sex determination. Presenting what he

centage of male births following early cycle insemination was reported by these researchers as being between 52 and 84 per cent, as compared with a male birth percentage of between 13 and 52 per cent for inseminations on days 15-23.
However, not all the data presented in the early 1900's supported the view that early inseminations favored males. For example, Blumenfeld (1925, cited in James, 1971) found that "postmenstrum" conceptions yielded only 43 per cent males. Similarly, Nurnberger (1918, cited in James, 1971), using data supplied from the German War Office, reported a slight increase in male births (55 per cent) when insemination took place during days 15-23 following the beginning of the menstrual flow, as compared to a 51 per cent prevalence of male births when insemination occurred in the first 9 days of the cycle.
INTERMENSTRTJAL INSEMINATION
Dechman (1916), Tucker (1925), and Carr (1938) were among those who claimed that intermenstrual inseminations, not early

termed the "Law of Latent Reserve Energy" (for which he reserved a copyright), Dechman (1916) claimed that the sex of a child was the result of a struggle between the egg and sperm, the victory going to the one that was weakest at the time of conception. In response to what Dechman called the "Law of Preservation of Kind," the victorious cell then engendered a child of the "opposite" sex. The timing advice which resulted from this rather enigmatic pattern of events was that couples desiring a male should focus intercourse midcycle when the egg was allegedly deteriorating. The egg would thus "win" the struggle, which would lead to the conception of a child of the "opposite" sex, in this case a male.
Tucker (1925), who also believed in midcycle insemination for male births, discarded the "latent reserve energy" theory and merely claimed that the child was always the opposite sex of the parent who was "stronger" at the moment of insemination. Tucker thus maintained that since a woman was naturally weak at or around

the time of her menstrual flow, prospective parents seeking a son should focus their coital activity in the intermenstrual phase of the wife's cycle when she was in her full vigor.
Carr (1938) agreed with Dechman and Tucker's timing advice, for a different reason. He believed there was a natural struggle between the "female" egg and "male" sperm, but that the victor cell directly determined the sex of the child without any "crossover" activity. His fundamental law was that all female germ cells strive to produce a girl; all male germ cells, a boy. Thus, during the intermenstrual phase when the egg was allegedly in an advanced stage of aging, the sperm would easily win the struggle, and a male conception would result. As stated by Carr (1938, p. 27), it "appears that the life of every boy is a spark caught by the flickering failing torch of the dying mother germ" while a girl originates "in full flame of mother power."
Much earlier, in 1863, French veterinary surgeon Thury had observed that queen bees lay their female eggs first. He assumed this general theory was also applicable to humans and therefore recommended that couples seeking sons have intercourse some 13-17 days after the beginning of the wife's menstrual period (cited in MacFadden and Clinton, 1935). Thury based his theory on the belief that the sex of the child was a function of the age of the ovum, the more fully ripened ovum leading to a male, the imperfect one resulting in a female. Thury believed that insemination during the transition from the female to male ovum phase might result in a hermaphroditic child.
PREMENSTRUAL INSEMINATION
At least three independent twentieth century writers vigorously denied that early

or middle cycle inseminations were desirable for male births.
Cox (1923), who claimed that any woman with ordinary common sense and careful observation could determine the duration of her own ovum, generally agreed with Thury's theory that the sex of the child was determined by the age of the ovum. However, Cox counseled would-be parents of a boy to postpone coitus until around day 21 of the wife's cycle to ensure that the ovum had matured to the fullest stage of its development.
McElrath (1911) also recommended late inseminations for male conceptions, although he arrived at his conclusion in a different manner. McElrath wrote that a male birth followed the fertilization of a newly released fresh ovum. Intercourse around the nineteenth day of the cycle might trigger ovulation well before it would have occurred spontaneously (that is, just before menstrual flow), and thus a fresh ovum could be fertilized immediately after its release from the ovary. McElrath felt that at least two pieces of sociological evidence supported his theory. Conceptions occurring during the first month of marriage were more likely to be male since it was the prevailing custom to schedule weddings about two weeks after the end of the menstrual flow. Conversely, according to McElrath, illegitimate births were more likely to be female, since harlots were less likely to abstain from intercourse in the days during and just after the menstrual flow, thus maximizing the probability of fertilizing a "stale egg."
MacFadden (1935) was also a member of the school that advocated late insemination for male births. In addition to correlating intercourse patterns with moon phases, he recommended intercourse on the 21-23 days of the cycle, or 5 to 7 days

Shettles (1970,1961,1960), Guerrero notes an excess of girls following artificial insemination three or more days before ovulation (as indicated by an upward shift in basal body temperature) or one or more days

after it. Onthe other hand, he reports that the opposite trend is observed for natural insemination. An excess of boys is associated with inseminations taking place four or more days before the shift orone ormore days after it. The probability of males resulting from natural insemination is decreased in the days around the thermal shift.
The underlying causes of this marked differential in the effect of insemination timing between natural and artificial insemination are yet unclear. Perhaps the physiological changes that occur during the menstrual cycle and those which may occur during sexual intercourse but not during artificial insemination (particularly female orgasm) play a significant role in the selection process of androsperm and gynosperm.
DISCUSSION
The late nineteenth century and early twentieth century observations that inseminations early in the menstrual cycle favor male births, the artificial insemination statistics which correlate inseminations at ovulation with increased male births, and the Guerrero (1971, 1970) data which appear to resolve those apparent discrepancies, all suggest that the timing of insemination within a woman's menstrual cycle mayplay a role in determining the sex of her child. More clinical research which correlates date of insemination, menstrual-cycle day, and sex outcome is necessary to further elucidate this relationship.

In the collection and presentation of data in this area, it isimportant that both sensitive and standard means of ovulation detection be employed to avoid confusion in methodology. For example, Benendo (1970) uniformly identified the time of ovulation as "14 days before the beginning of the menstrual flow," thus rendering his results incomparable to those of Kleegman (1966, 1954) and Guerrero (1971, 1970) who relied on individual basal bodytemperature readings.
In addition to further research onthe correlation of menstrual histories and insemination dates, more information is needed about the biological factors which may be operative in bringing about the insemination timing effect. For instance, if shifts in vaginal or cervical pH are important in determining various sex ratios, one might expect that contraceptive failures associated with those birth control methods which may alter the pH of the reproductive tract (the progesterone-only pill, vaginal spermicides, intrauterine devices) would reflect a skewed sex ratio. Similarly, one might note an unusual sex ratio among women who consistently had orgasm prior to insemination.
A closer analysis of anthropological, demographic, and epidemiologic data on natural variations in the sex ratio would also beinvaluable toboth the evaluationof clinical hypotheses related to insemination timing and to the development of new areas of investigation.
