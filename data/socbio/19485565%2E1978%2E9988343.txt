ABSTRACT: This effort to locate correlates of violent crime found that the most violent delinquents were males from large intact families. Although males were generally much more violent than females, this was not true among small intact families where violence was low and equal for males and females.

The prediction of violence has been a difficult task (Glaser et al., 1966). As a result, rather than attempting longitudinal predictive studies, most researchers have focused upon identifying correlates of violent behavior. In this way, several violence-related variables have been identified. According to Palmer (1973, pp. 16-17), the foremost variable is maleness; the second is youth. Males in their late teens to early twenties compose the vast majority of the population of violent offenders. Both the incidence of delinquency and its more violent expressions have also been related to socioeconomic, geographic, ethnocultural, situational, and family variables. Family variables long prominent in explaining delinquency include the broken family, poor supervision and discipline, and lack of love from the youngster's parents (McCord et al., 19S9).
The present study examined two family variables--broken families and large families--within a sample of delinquents in order to test their association with violent crimes.

BACKGROUND
BROKEN FAMILIES
Perhaps because "love" is still somewhat difficult to measure, and the "broken family" fairly easy, more research has concentrated on the effects of father-absence than on the more subtle variable of the quality of the father's presence. Fatherabsence, usually associated with broken families, has long been associated with delinquency, despite evidence that there may well be no relationship between the two (e.g., Burgess and Price, 1963, p. 184, cited in Herzog, 1973, p. 48; Linder et al., 1974).
Further, a recent study (Andrew, 1976) found that,broken homes in themselves related to the incidence of delinquency for female delinquents only. Since females constitute only a small portion of the delinquent population, this finding suggests that the effect of broken families on delinquency may be minimal. When we turn from considering the incidence of delinquency toward examining the violence of delinquency, the larger number of males becomes even more prominent (Andrew, 1974a). Therefore, the effect of broken homes on the overall violence level within

the population might be expected to be even more minimal.
Some authorities have found that the intact family may, under some circumstances, produce more violence than the broken family. Intact families may display a "cohesive familism" (Linder et al., 1974) and an emotional intensity that can precipitate violence (Gorney, 1975). The large intact family may encourage stereotyped sex roles (Eagly and Anderson, 1974) and perhaps evoke the historical stereotype of the violent American male. Also, in terms of modeling influences, having a pathological father may be more damaging than having no father at all (Robins et al., 1975) or than having a stepfather (Lessing et al., 1970).
However, in contrast to the above studies, two studies have linked father-absence to violence among delinquents (Chilton and Markle, 1972; Toby, 1966). The relation between broken families and violence is thus still unclear.
FAMILY SIZE
This second family variable is as easy to measure as are broken homes, and the data also seem contradictory. A review by Thompson (1974) and a survey by Linn (1973) suggest that the public still, to a great extent, glamorizes large families and stigmatizes small families, and especially "only children," viewing such children as maladjusted, "spoiled," and generally deviant. Yet large families produce more delinquents than smaller families (Andrew, 1976; Breckinridge and Abbott, 1912; Burns and Stern, 1967, p. 391; Wolkind, 1974).
The large-family effect has been associated with the incidence of delinquency among males (Andrew, 1976: Bandura and Walters, 1959; Bennett, 1960; Breckinridge and Abbott, 1912; Burns and Stern, 1967; Wolkind, 1974). It is easier to find reasons why large families may create

delinquency in general than to find reasons for a specific effect on males. It may be speculated that males may be more vulnerable than females to those influences that seem to incline to delinquency.
Children from large families have lower IQ's than those from small families (Anastasi, 1956; Belmont and Marolla, 1973) and poorer verbal ability in particular (Kellaghan and McNamara, 1972), which in turn has been linked to delinquency (Andrew, 1974¿>,c).
Secondly, motivations for producing large families may involve "instrumental values" (Rabin and Greene, 1968; Thompson, 1974), perhaps a disinclination toward care in contraception (Meléis, 1971) or a need to "act out" traditional family values. Such motivations may lead in some cases to a devaluing of the individual child which may lead to brutal or subtle neglect. One evidence of such neglect may be the poorer nutrition which, surprisingly enough, has been found in children from large intact families but not in those from small broken families (Cook, et al., 1973).
Thirdly, the large family may impose density, which in itself may produce stress (Loo, 1973; Newman and Pollack, 1973; Rodgers, 1972). Crowded surroundings may also increase noise levels which may make verbal learning difficult. By this route, that is, by decreasing verbal skills, crowding may increase acting-out (Andrew, 1974¿>,c).
The above studies again refer only to the incidence of delinquency, not of violence. Recently, violence too, at least among male delinquents in Germany, has been found more often among those from large families than from small ones (Schindler, 1975).
ETHNICITY
It was considered important for several reasons to examine different ethnic groups

separately to determine whether findings would be consistent across ethnic groupings. First, ethnicity may relate to family size (Andrew, 1976). In violence studies, ethnicity is usually mentioned as a variable, together with disclaimers suggesting that other variables, such as family variables, may be responsible (Glaser et al., 1966; Palmer, 1973). Further, three of the cited studies (Cook et al., 1973; Linder et al., 1974; Schindler, 197S) were conducted in non-American cultures (England, Canada, and Germany, respectively). It would be of great interest if ethnic differences were found; and, if none were found, this would contribute to generality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study hypothesized that violence among a group of delinquents on probation would be greater (a) for males than females, (b)for those from broken families vs. intact families, and (c) for those from large families vs. small families. It was also expected that these trends would be consistent across ethnic groups.
SUBJECTS
Subjects were 214 delinquents, aged 12-20, referred consecutively by probation officers for psychological evaluation to aid in treatment planning. They were predominately of lower socioeconomic class.
All probationers had been assigned to San Diego's experimental probation program which features intensive supervision and availability of psychological consultation in lieu of incarceration. Data were retrieved from psychology files.
VIOLENCE MEASURE
"Violence" was defined as the likelihood of causing bodily harm to another, and secondarily, nonbodily harm. The measure of violence shown in Table 1 was the Violence Scale (Andrew, 1974a) which provides numerical values for each crime,

ranging from 1.00, smoking by a minor, to 56.00, voluntary manslaughter. The Violence Scale represents the averaged judgment of four professionals in probation as to the probability of a given crime resulting in harm to another. Rap sheets were examined, and the numerical value was read from the Violence Scale for each delinquent's most serious crime. For instance, if a youngster had been charged with an assault (score, 48.50), and a petty theft (score, 25.50), then his or her score would be 48.50. The average score of the present sample, 36.81, would correspond approximately to 37.00, burglary.
STATISTICAL TREATMENT
An analysis of variance was to be performed within ethnic categories, using as independent variables the sex of the delinquent, the broken/intact family variable, and the family size. The dependent variable was to be the score on the Violence Scale (Andrew, 1974a).
However, several empty cells occurred. To make possible an appropriate statistical analysis, the following adjustments were made. Anglo-Caucasians and Mexican-Caucasians were combined into a group called "Caucasians." Blacks and "others" were combined into "nonCaucasians." One empty cell remained, in that there were no non-Caucasian male delinquents from small intact families. The separation by ethnicity was therefore approached indirectly by examining first the total sample, and then the Caucasians only. Differences between the two analyses would then be attributable to the influence of the non-Caucasian sample.
RESULTS
As hypothesized (a), male delinquents were far more violent than female delinquents (Tables 2 and 3), which supported many previous studies (Andrew, 1974a; Palmer, 1973).

· From Andrew, 1974a.

Contrary to the hypotheses, however, the analysis of variance showed no main effect upon violence scores of either (b) broken families or (c) large families. There was a significant interaction between all three of the independent variables (sex, family intactness, and family size) as is shown in Tables 2 and 3. From the data in Table 2, the effect was traced to the greater violence of males from large intact families as compared with all other subgroups (Table 4).
Hypothesis (d) was only partly supported. Both the Caucasian subsample and the total sample showed a main sex effect, supporting generality across ethnic groups. Further, generality appeared in

the finding that large intact families produced more violence than other family types among Anglo and Black males and Black females, F (1,139) = 11.74, p < 0.001, with Anglo females reacting differently. Further, within the formallyplanned analysis of variance, interaction effects (sex x family size; sex x family size x intact/broken family) appeared stronger for the Caucasian than for the nonCaucasian subsample.
These interactions appeared to stem from the greatest violence among Caucasian females being associated with the small intact family, whereas among males the least violence is produced by the small intact family. Within this one family type,

react quite differently. Further, the uneven incidence produces small numbers within some family and ethnic groups, making the findings quite tenuous, espedaily in regard to females. In any case, it would appear that family/violence relationships cannot be generalized across all ethnic groups and that further research should include adequate numbers of sex/ ethnicity/family subgroupings.
Keeping in mind, then, the tentative nature of these speculations, we may question why there should be a sex difference within most family types with the exception of the small intact family. Clues from

prevalence of these patterns among more violent delinquents. The pattern of large intact families was more productive of violence than were small broken families, The present data, then, support Thompson's (1974) formulations about a cultural blind spot and suggest that further exploration be made of the nature of this bias,
It is, of course, possible that the bias lies within the present study, due to lack of random assignment from the total population of delinquents. However, the evidence of prior studies appears to support the present formulations, with exceptions as noted.

other studies (Dion, 1974; Gerber, 1973; Toby, 1966) suggest that a child may have a special need for the cross-sex parent, perhaps in order to complete the formation of a balanced superego. The broken family would usually imply father-absence; the
