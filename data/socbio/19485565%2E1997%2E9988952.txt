ABSTRACT: Assortative mating results both from social homogamy (coming for similar environments) and active phenotypic assortment (seeking a mate with desired attributes). Dating advertisements provide a means of assessing the role of active phenotypic assortment in the absence of social homogamy. The relative frequency of mention of different attributes (given limited advertising space) is informative regarding the salience of these attributes in active phenotypic assortment. Sex differences in self descriptions and in attributes desired in others in dating advertisements provide a means of evaluating sociobiological issues. Data were analyzed from 191 ads placed by females and 253 ads placed by males seeking to meet members of the opposite sex. The most frequently mentioned attributes are age, race, occupation, moral characteristics, and physical attractiveness. While close to 80 per cent of the advertisers provided information concerning their own race/ethnicity, only a minority of those providing such information limited their quest for a partner to members of their own race/ethnicity. There is substantial assortative mating for religion, family background, status, and educational attainment, yet these attributes are rarely (religion and education) or never (family background) mentioned in advertisements, suggesting that assortative mating on these dimensions may be solely a consequence of social homogamy.

Persons marry individuals similar to themselves, demonstrating positive or homogamous assortative mating. Homogamous assortative mating results from both social homogamy (propinquity; sharing the same environment), since persons from the same milieu are likely to be somewhat similar to one another on many dimensions, and from active phenotypic assortment (a search for a mate with desired characteristics) (Heath and Eaves, 1985).
Newspaper dating advertisements are pure cases of active phenotypic assortment and, as such, can provide a means of establishing the relative importance of different attributes to males and females actively searching for a partner, that is, assessing

the role of active phenotypic assortment in the absence of social homogamy.
Dating advertisements often have been used in prior research (see studies cited by Jason et al., 1992; Greenlees and McGrew, 1994), but not as a means of examining the relative influences of social homogamy and active phenotypic assortment on mate selection. Greenlees and McGrew (1994) derived a number of hypotheses from the sociobiological literature that they put to the test in their own research. They found that men more often offer and women more often seek cues concerning resources; that women seek males older than themselves and men seek women younger than themselves; that women, more than men, report on their physical

appearance and men, more than women, seek out information concerning potential partners' physical appearance; and that women more often than men seek permanent monogamous relationships while men more often seek extramarital or "casual" relationships.
Neither the papers cited by Greenlees and McGrew (1994) not their own report examine the personal attributes not used in self descriptions by advertisers and not sought for as information concerning the prospective partner. Attributes mentioned concerning the self and the sought-for partner are those of importance in active phenotypic assortment. Attributes neither mentioned nor sought for in active phenotypic assortment also are of research interest. This lack of mention presumably results from their being regarded by the advertiser as unimportant in establishing a successful relationship with the person responding to the advertisement. The present report is of attributes used and not used by advertisers to describe themselves and the attributes sought for in prospective partners by males and females placing dating advertisements in a daily newspaper.
It is well known that racial homogamy in marriage is substantial. The debate concerning race differences in attributes has continued for decades. It seems reasonable to believe that if racial groups differed markedly in attributes likely to influence the success of marriage or a marriage-like relationship, ordinary citizens should be sufficiently observant to note these differences, and there should be a high degree of active phenotypic assortment for race. If, on the other hand, homogamous assortative mating for race results largely from social homogamy, then race should not loom large in the

specifications for prospective partners in dating advertisements. The issue of race differences has been subject to sufficient controversy that the role of race in dating advertisements will be considered separately from other attributes in the analyses presented below.
The major theme of this paper has to do with active phenotypic assortment in dating advertisements. The analyses permit a replication of the sociobiological research of Greenlees and McGrew (1994), and these data also will be reported.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Before describing the S's who provided data for this report, we should note that these data are from Hawaii, a multiethnic state. The total population of Hawaii (State of Hawaii data book, 1993, p. 37; 1990 data) is 1,089,573. This figure includes 139,253 military and military dependents (basically, short-term residents), approximately 60 per cent of whom are Caucasians, but does not include military living in barracks or aboard a ship. Of the entire population, including the military and dependents, 24 per cent are of Caucasian ancestry, 20 per cent of Japanese ancestry, 18 per cent Hawaiian or part Hawaiian, 18 per cent mixed non-Hawaiian, 11 per cent Filipino, and the remainder from other groups. Buddhists, followers of Confucian philosophy, Shintoists, and other religious groups are present in large numbers, along with followers of the Judeo-Christian tradition.
SUBJECTS AND MATERIALS
The S's consist of 191 women and 253 men placing heterosexual ads ("women

seeking men" or "men seeking women") in "It's A Date" advertisements featured every Friday in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin during the time interval assessed. Stated advertising policy precluded advertisements for casual relationships and limited advertising space to five lines in one column (approximately 25-30 words). Data were examined from the advertisements published on one randomly chosen Friday per month for six months. The advertisements were carefully checked to assure that no ad was double-counted across months.
We sought to do two things in analyses of these advertisements. We sought to ascertain the relative importance of different attributes in active phenotypic assortment, as evidenced by the frequency with which these attributes were mentioned in the advertisements. We sought to replicate the Greenlees and McGrew (1994) analyses regarding sex differences in advertisement content as these differences relate to sociobiological theory.
Data were entered for each advertisement of male and female advertisers regarding whether or not the advertisements included each of a variety of items of information concerning the advertisers and the sought-for partners. These were age, race/ethnicity, financial security, occupational level (e.g., "professional"), specific occupation (e.g., accountant), height, weight, physical attractiveness, personality attributes divided into the major categories moral characteristics (e.g., trustworthy, sincere, reliable), personableness (e.g., fun-loving, enjoyable), and ambitiousness (e.g., ambitious, hard working), and hobbies and recreational choices (e.g., activities involving exercise or fitness such as hiking and surfing). Other "miscellaneous" personality attrib-

utes that did not fall in those groups listed above also were mentioned but are not reported on herein. This categorization of information was adopted from Greenlees and McGrew (1994). Advertising policies precluded us from assessing sex differences in seeking a long-term stable vs. casual relationship, an important part of the Greenlees and McGrew study.
RESULTS
Data obtained shown in Table 1 are the number of females and males who included specific kinds of information concerning themselves and about the person sought. Data regarding hobbies and recreational activities yielded little useful information and are not included in Table 1. Data are presented in terms of numbers and per cents of persons providing specific kinds of information. There are four kinds of possible significant differences: 1. females more often described themselves than the person sought, 2. males more often describe themselves than the person sought, 3. the two sexes differ in the frequency with which they use an attribute to describe themselves, and 4. the two sexes differ in the frequency with which they use an attribute to describe the person sought. Significant differences in the per cents of S's, for each of the four kinds of comparisons, were assessed through obtaining the significance of differences between per cents (McNemar, 1949). Those differences that are significant are cited at the right hand of Table 1, using the following code: FS (female self) greater > or less < than MPS (male partner sought), MS (male self) greater > or less < than FPS (female partner sought), FS > or < than MS, MPS > or < than FPS.

As noted above, newspaper rules precluded seeking casual affairs. Probably for this reason, few advertisers listed marital status. Only seven of the 444 advertisers mentioned own religious affiliation or the expected involvement of a prospective partner. Only ten S's (all male) specified their own level of educational attainment and only one (male) specified the desired educational level of a prospective partner. Not one advertiser mentioned his or her family social background/social status.
A total of 355 of our 444 S's (79.95%) provided information concerning their own race; 145 of 191 (75.92%) females and 210 of 253 (83.00%) males. Of those providing information, 108 (74.48%) females and 156 (74.28%) of the males were Caucasian. The comparatively small numbers of persons from other groups caused us to combine them into single "non-Caucasian" category. The very substantial over-representation of Caucasian advertisers compared with their frequency in the population probably is because most newcomers to the islands are Caucasians. This is true for military and military dependents. It is also the case for college students (Johnson and Ogasawara, 1988) and probably is true for the general population as well. The frequency with which S's who listed their own race sought members of different races as partners is shown in Table 2.
Among the non-Caucasians there were seven females and three males who specifically sought other non-Caucasians, but non-Caucasians of a different race than their own (e.g., Chinese male seeking Hawaiian female). An additional 19 females did not list their own race but specified the race of a partner sought (eleven Caucasian and eight non-Cau-

casian). Ten males did not list their own race but specified the race of a partner sought (three Caucasian and seven nonCaucasian).
In one sense, race is important. Close to 80 per cent of advertisers listed their own race. This may be because of the multi-racial nature of the population, making one aware of the existence of race as a variable. However, given 25-30 words to use in ads, about 20 per cent of advertisers did not list their race. Of those who provided information concerning their own race, approximately 51 per cent of the Caucasians and 44 per cent of the non-Caucasians did not specify the race of this desired partner, 26 per cent of the Caucasians specifically sought other Caucasians, and 33 per cent of the nonCaucasians sought other non-Caucasians. Of the non-Caucasians seeking nonCaucasians, 33 per cent sought nonCaucasians of an ethnic group other than their own. It seems clear that the desire to limit one's search for a mate to members of one's own group is relatively uncommon in an environment in which members of different racial/ethnic groups frequently interact.
DISCUSSION
We sought to assess the degree to which active phenotypic assortment, independent from social homogamy, resulted in homogamous assortative mating. Some attributes for which there is substantial assortment, such as religious affiliation, educational attainment, and family background are rarely or never mentioned in advertisements, suggesting that assortative mating on these dimensions are a consequence of social homogamy. Age, occupation, attractiveness,

and personality characteristics having to do with moral character loom quite large in advertisements, suggesting a substantial degree of active phenotypic assortment regarding these attributes. Given the importance of race in scientific controversies we believe our results in this area are of importance. Race is important enough for advertisers to note their own race with considerable frequency. Age information is provided more often than race, as are personality attributes (moral attributes such as trustworthy, honesty, etc., by far the most frequently mentioned personality attributes), and occupational information is provided by advertisers almost as frequently as race. Race is of importance in the sense that most advertisers provided information concerning their own race. Yet less than a third of persons providing information concerning their own race/ethnic ethnicity race specifically seek members of their own race. Race is not important in terms of the partner sought.
It is true that there are very few African-Americans residing in Hawaii (16,180 according to the State of Hawaii

data book, 1993, p. 37), and the current debates concerning race differences usually have to do with African-American/ Caucasian-American differences. However, it should be recognized that the same kind of negative beliefs expressed concerning African-Americans were held in the 1920's with regard to persons of southern and eastern European ancestry (e.g., see Brigham, 1923) and held until recently (may be still held in some areas) regarding persons of Asian ancestry ("the wily oriental") and of mixed ancestry ("the treacherous half caste"). Hawaiians were described as being savages during the 1920's, most often by west coast Hearst newspapers (see Packer and Thomas, 1966). These beliefs no longer seem to be widely held. They certainly are not expressed in the scientific literature.
Our results are quite clear, but their generality can be questioned. Are persons placing advertisements in dating columns representative of the population from which they were drawn? The scanty data available suggest that they are not "rejects," but are people who, because of
