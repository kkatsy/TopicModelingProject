In 1960, studies were initiated to determine the etiological importance of genetic and certain nongenetic factors for various congenital malformations in the state of Utah. The results of several of these studies have been published (Woolf, Woolf, and Broadbent, 1963a, 1963J, 1964,1965; Woolf, 1963; Woolf, Koehn, and Coleman, 1968). Other studies are in progress. These investigations have been carried out in Utah, taking advantage of a population that is relatively close-knit because of religious (Mormon) background. Another advantage is the availability of genealogical records for families affiliated with the Mormon church (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). These records facilitate genetic studies.
It was evident from the outset of these studies that incidence values for various congenital malformations were needed for the determination of control values. Since these values were not available for any segment of the Utah population, an effort was made to obtain them by using nursery records in the Latter-day Saints Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. When a newly born infant is admitted to the nursery of this hospital, specific information is logged in a

record book: surname, date of birth, and sex. Any malformation or disorder noted by the attending physicians at the time of birth, or during the sojourn of the infant in the nursery, is made part of the record. These records were surveyed for the years 19511961. During these years, 59,561 live births occurred in this hospital, representing about 23% of the total live births in the state for this period. The great majority of patients who enter this hospital are Caucasian. Hence, the nursery records reflect incidence values among live births for Caucasians living in or near Salt Lake City, Utah. The nursery records contain reliable information for obvious congenital malformations; however, by their nature, they are not as complete as medical records. Nonetheless, nursery records are more complete than birth certificates, a source frequently used to obtain incidence data.
Neel (1958) has emphasized the importance of obtaining reliable incidence data for congenital malformations in various populations. He has proposed that a variation in incidence values for specific malformations among populations (racial group) may reflect differences in the frequencies of polygenes. This proposal is based on a con-

cept proposed by Lerner (1954) that Mendelian populations carry polygenic reserves that increase the probability of normal development through a buffering action. These polygenes are maintained in a population by selection for the heterozygote. "Phenodeviants" occur when the number of heterozygous loci falls below a threshold value. Certain types of congenital malformations may qualify as Lerner's phenodeviants, and through the action of natural selection, populations may have evolved different polygenic systems; hence, a specific phenodeviant may occur at a higher frequency in one racial group than another.
Since little has been published on the incidence of congenital malformations in the various populations in the United States, the incidence values based on the nursery records are presented here. These incidence values have merit because of the welldefined structure of the population and the relatively large size of the sample.
STRUCTURE OF THE POPULATION
The population of Utah is predominantly Caucasian. Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. Salt Lake Valley and the surrounding area soon became a "genetic melting pot" of individuals of different nationalities. Between 1847 and the coming of the railroad in 1869, 80,000 members of the church from the United States and Europe crossed the plains and mountains from the Midwest to the Salt Lake Valley with ox- or mule-driven wagons or by walking and pushing handcarts. From 1850 to 1900, over 30,000 converts emigrated to Utah from the Scandinavian countries (Mulder, 1955), and from 1850 to 1929, over 52,000 emigrated from Great Britain (Evans, 1937). Converts arrived in smaller numbers from Germany, Holland, Austria, France, Switzerland, and elsewhere. In 1880, twentyfive different nationalities were represented (Mulder, 1956).

Although Mormon communities were established in many locations in the intermountain West, and many of these relatively isolated communities were colonized by groups of families, the rate of inbreeding in the state never went as high as might have been expected. A study of the frequency of consanguineous marriages among the Mormon people and their relatives living in Utah and in ten geographic regions in the United States revealed that inbreeding has been minimal when compared with populations in other parts of the world (Woolf et al., 1956). The Mormon people in Utah, especially those residing in cities, are highly outbred, a situation resulting from the continual flow of emigrants to Utah and the social pressure, especially in recent years, against the marriage of closely related individuals. The composite and outbred nature of the population dictates that traits resulting from rare autosomal recessive genes and polygenes (quasi-continuous variation) should be relatively infrequent.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A summary of the congenital malformations listed in the nursery records is presented in Table 1. The malformations are grouped into systems, following the procedure of Neel (1958), Morton, Chung, and Mi (1967), and Adams and Niswander (1968). At least one malformation was listed for 1,227 (654 males, 573 females) of the 59,561 infants (30,674 males, 28,887 females). The frequency of males with a malformation (2.13%) is not significantly different (0.20 > P > 0.10) from the frequency of affected females (1.98%).
The total frequency (2.06%) ranks among the top of those values reported for other populations with or without stillbirths included. Neel (1958) observed a total malformation frequency of 1.02% for the Japanese population (live births and stillbirths). Frequency values of 1.58% and

2.44% among Caucasian and Negro births, respectively, including live births and fetal deaths, were observed by Chung and Myrianthopolous (1968). Adams and Niswander (1968) found a malformation frequency of 1.86% among North American Indian infants (live births and stillbirths). Using birth and death certificates, Morton et al. (1967) found a total frequency of 0.93% among the various racial groups in Hawaii.
The relatively high incidence (2.01%) obtained in this study is explicable by certain idiosyncrasies of the nursery records. As a part of a resident training and research program, the majority of the infants in the nursery were given an extensive orthopedic examination during the years 1951, 1954, and 1955 (Coleman, 1956). An emphasis was placed on the detection of hip dysplasia and club foot. Anomalies of the muscularskeletal system are described in detail and occur at a high frequency in the records during these years. The incidence of hip disease

and club foot, based solely on the data in the nursery records, is extraordinary. The problem of obtaining a valid incidence value for hip disease from the nursery data has been discussed elsewhere (Woolf et al., 1968). The removal of only club foot (484 cases) from the calculations reduced the total malformation incidence value for the period 1951-1961 from 2.06% to 1.24%, a rate which might be anticipated for live births.
Minor cases of club foot and hip dysplasia can be detected by a rigorous examination. Questions also obviously exist concerning the definition of these disorders. For club foot, the data in the nursery records indicate that variation in diagnosis was most apparent for talipes calcaneovalgus. The incidence values (frequency per 1,000) for the years 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, and 1955, were 21.61, 2.48, 3.66, 19.02, and 10.79, respectively, with an overall value of 11.38. The incidence values for metatarsus varus for these same years were 9.7, 1.45,

0.00,6.48, and 3.91, with an overall value of 4.23. Incidence values for the most severe type of club foot, talipes equineovarus, showed relatively minimal yearly variation during this period: 2.87, 1.66, 1.63, 3.24, 1.68. The overall incidence (2.20) is similar to that (2.32) reported by Chung and Myrianthopolous (1968) for the incidence of talipes equineovarus in Caucasians and

may reflect the true incidence of this disorder in the Utah population.
A comparison of incidence values obtained for different populations is quite meaningless when there is variation in the criteria of diagnosis and reporting procedures. The completeness of the nursery records for club foot during 1951-55 is contrasted with their incompleteness during 1956-61. During the latter period this anomaly is usually listed merely as club foot and is not categorized as to type. Such brevity was rare during 1951-55. Yearly incidence values for club foot (all types) are shown in Table 2. For comparative reasons,

the incidence is also given for cleft lip with or without cleft palate.
The absence of the orthopedic examinations during 1956-61 apparently resulted in the under-reporting of minor malformations. For this reason, the incidence values reported here are more valid for those malformations that are obvious at birth, not only to the attending physicians but also to the nurses who care for the infants in the nursery. Incidence values for these malformations are summarized in Table 3.
The use of the nursery records obviously leads to a biased estimate of the incidence of any malformation increasing the probability of fetal death. An example is anencephaly. An anencephalic fetus is rarely carried to term. It is born dead or dies shortly after birth; hence, it would tend not to be registered in the nursery with the live births. Only 6 cases were reported in the nursery records (3 males and 3 females) giving an incidence of 0.10 per 1,000. The incidence of anencephaly will be higher if records of fetal deaths are included. For example, using live births and stillbirths, Neel (1958) found an incidence of 0.63 per 1,000 for the Japanese; Chung and Myrianthopoulos (1968) observed an incidence of 1.40 per 1,000 for Caucasians in the United States; and Adams and Niswander (1968) noted 0.32 per 1,000 for the American Indians.
The incidence of multiple malformations involving more than one system (71 cases) was 1.19 per 1,000, with a sex ratio favoring males (42 males, 29 females). The frequency among total malformed infants was 5.8%. If club foot is removed from the calculations, the frequency among the total malformed infants is increased to 9.6%. Even though major multiple malformations may increase the probability of fetal death, the observed incidence value and frequency among total malformed infants are relatively similar to those observed in other studies

missing radius, giving an incidence of 2 in 59,651, or about 1 in 30,000. Birch-Jensen (1948) found that the prevalence of congenital absence of the radius in the adult population of Denmark is about 1 in 55,000. Because of the high mortality in these cases during the first two decades of life, he estimated that the incidence at birth is near 1 in 30,000. It is of interest that his postulated value agrees so well with the one obtained in this study.
Of importance are incidence values that characterize racial groups. The Japanese show a high incidence of cleft lip with or without cleft palate (Neel, 1958). The American Negro is noted for a very high incidence of polydactyly. Using birth certificates in Baltimore, Maryland, as the source material, Frazier (1960) showed that nonwhites have a higher total malformation rate than whites; however, if polydactyly cases are removed from both samples, the total rate is higher among whites. This trend was also noted by Chung and Myrianthopoulos (1968). The data of Adams and Niswander (1968) suggest that the American Indian also has a relatively high incidence of polydactyly (2.45 per 1,000). The population in Utah attending the Latter-day Saints Hospital shows incidence values expected of a Caucasian population. Incidence rates for cleft lip and polydactyly, and other major malformations apparent at birth, are of the same magnitude reported for other Caucasian populations, when reporting differences are considered (Neel, 1958;

Chung and Myrianthopoulos, 1968). This fact enhances the nursery records as a source for obtaining control values for genetic studies. These control values may also be useful in the long range study of any possible induced mutation in the Utah population because of its proximity to the Nevada site for the testing of atomic devices.
SUMMARY
Nursery records on file in the Latter-day Saints Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, were used to obtain incidence values for various congenital malformations for the years 1951-61. The population of Utah is largely Caucasian, with a well-defined structure because of the impact of the Mormon church.
The nursery records yield valid incidence rates for major malformations readily diagnosed in live births. These incidence values are of the same magnitude as those obtained for other Caucasian populations. These values are useful for obtaining control values in genetic studies.
Evidence for subjectivity in the diagnosis of club foot and hip dysplasia is well documented in the nursery records. This points out the need of similar methods of diagnosis and reporting in any comparative studies of the incidence of certain types of anomalies.
