When the Chilean National Health Service expanded its network of rural posts in 1968, a prospective study was begun to compare trends in natality and health in communities where family planning would be included among health services with others where it would not. By replicating the comparisons in a series of small, matched, relatively isolated populations, the effects of the family planning programs might be measured, essentially freed from the influence of other variables. The costs of the programs were also to be measured and related to any attributive benefits.
Before any changes were introduced, a base-line survey was made with maps of IS villages, censuses of their 3,982 households with over 20,000 members, and interviews with 3,528 resident women of reproductive age. This initial report describes the demographic conditions and the family planning attitudes and practices existing in rural Chile before contraceptive education and materials were offered in selected localities.
MATERIAL AND METHODS To achieve maximum representativeness in the sample, suitable communities were

sought throughout the area starting several hundred miles north of Santiago, beyond which most rural people live in small oasis settlements or around scattered mines, to about a thousand miles south where rain and cold impose their constraints. The IS communities1 eventually selected, however, were all located in the country's principal agricultural zone between 150 and 600 miles south of the capital. While farming of various types was the primary economic activity in most of the localities, lumbering predominated in two towns in the Andean foothills and fishing in two others on the coast.
The sample was chosen on the basis of the following criteria: It was essential that each site have approximately 1,000 to 2,500 people; that it match another, preferably dependent upon the same base hospital, in its demographic and socioeconomic characteristics; that it be relatively remote from the nearest city and hospital while remaining accessible to the interviewing team;

During the early phases of the investigation, Rauco began to be visited daily by a physician and was therefore dropped from the longitudinal study.

and that it have a Health Service post with a resident auxiliary and periodic visits by a physician. Ideally, all of the population theoretically dependent upon the post would have been included, but those families in the most inaccessible parts of the area of attraction were necessarily excluded. Because of these factors in selection, the final sample was not strictly representative of all of rural Chile.
Every community was mapped to localize the households and respondents precisely. The map established the boundaries of the study area and facilitated covering every house, making supervisory checks, and returning for subsequent interviews or clarification.
A de jure census was made of each household to identify its head and all members by age, sex, education, occupation, marital status, and relationship. Information on the house and its facilities (e.g., water supply, radio, sewage disposal) was also recorded.
The censuses and interviews were conducted by female students and graduates in social work or related professions from the regional branches of the University of Chile in Talca and Temuco. All had had interviewing experience but were further trained in theory and practice for this particular investigation.
Of the 3,677 women of fertile age ( 1 5 ^ 4 inclusive) identified by the census, 96% were interviewed.2 All of the communities were visited on at least three separate occasions to accomplish this, but the high success rate was principally attributable to the respondents' receptive cooperation. Although this seemed characteristic of rural Chileans, it may have been enhanced by the survey's focus on an area of special concern to the families: their health prob-

lems. The interviewing team was always accompanied by the authors, one of whom (Milanesi) completed some of the more difficult interviews and spot-checked others for reliability. Each census form and questionnaire was reviewed on completion, and the necessary clarifications were made immediately whenever feasible. The interviewers were quite well paid, but only for their satisfactorily completed questionnaires; they were persistent.
To facilitate comparisons, a number of items developed and tested by investigators at CELADE (the United Nations' Latin American Demographic Center) and the University of Chile were utilized in the questionnaire. Complete reproductive histories were recorded. An additional series of questions was asked of women currently pregnant or having had a delivery or abortion within the preceding five years. Information was obtained on medical service utilization and on relevant sodoeconomic and personal data. After a pretest, the open-ended questions were closed and precoding completed.
The first 1,817 interviews included a question on the woman's attitude toward family planning education. This question was then modified to elict reactions from the other 1,711 respondents to the possibility of having family planning programs in their local health posts.
The field work was carried out between February 19, 1969 and February 18, 1970.
DATA
DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
The age and sex distribution of the 21,246 residents covered by the censuses is shown in Figure 1 along with the same information for all of Chile (CELADE, 1969). The most notable contrast between the two population profiles is the deficit of young adults in the rural area and the corresponding preponderance of children and the old.

Consequently, the rural dependency ratio was 30% greater than that of the country as a whole. The proportional difference was even greater for the aged than for the children (Table 1). The pattern reflects the limited opportunities in the rural sector and the consequent emigration of young people, especially girls, to the larger towns and cities (Elizaga, 1969).
The distortion of the population pyramid was also conditioned by the high fertility of the women who remained and by some emigrant mothers leaving children behind with their grandparents. As a result, the child/

woman ratio of 778 was roughly a quarter above the national figure. The ratio may have declined somewhat in the last few years, judging by Figure 1 which shows more children aged 5-10 than under 5. Although this could have resulted from underreporting of babies or overstating young children's ages, it is consistent with the recently increased contraceptive use in these communities reported below.
According to recent data (United Nations' Demographic Yearbook, 1969), women marry later in Chile than in any other American country, and this seemed to hold true in the rural area as well (Table 2). Only 7.7% of those interviewed between the ages of IS and 19 were married and 0.6% were living in consensual union in contrast to women of the same age in Colombia, for example, among whom the cohabitation rate was almost double (11.2% married and 4.2% in consensual union). Even in the age group 20-24, Chilean women would be expected to have

bians simply because nearly 20% fewer of them were married. Adding to the effects of late marriage, about 15% of the rural women remained single throughout their fertile years. As a consequence of these nuptial patterns, only 51.9% of all women interviewed were currently married or in consensual union.

Countering the demographic, social,and contraceptive restraints on natality was the general practice of early weaning (Plank and Milanesi, in press). This tended to shorten birth intervals and thereby increase fertility.

in 1968. By the definition generally employed in Chile of 6 months menstrual age as the dividing line (CELADE, 1968), 20 of these were stillbirths and 71 were abortions, 4 admittedly induced. Omitting the abortions, so that only fetuses at risk were included (Shapiro et al., 1971), the stillbirth rate was 28.2 per thousand pregnancies. This was nearly twice the rate observed by Shapiro and his coworkers (1971) in New York City for fetuses of the same age. The greater mortality was associated with substantially lower levels of prenatal attention. Almost 90% of the New York women were already under medical supervision by their sixteenth week, whereas nearly a third of these rural women had no such care at any time. Part of the difference, of course, may have been due to misclassifying early neonatal deaths as stillbirths in the study areas.
The spontaneous abortion rate, on the other hand, was considerably below that noted in New York, (86.6/1,000 pregnancies vs. 131.5/1,000), and even there losses to women not presenting themselves for professional care went unrecorded. While biological explanations could be suggested, the apparent difference may have resulted entirely from defective recall. Milanesi, Berquo, and Silva (1972), for example, used home interviews to ascertain the events of the preceding year, as here, and then followed the respondents prospectively. The latter method detected 85% more spontaneous abortions, and probably at least that much recognizable pregnancy wastage went unreported in these rural communities.
It seems clear, therefore, that the retrospective method was inadequate for measuring early fetal deaths. It was the technique used in other studies of abortion in Chile, however, and the findings are compared in Table 4. Examining data from the year immediately preceding their interviews

in Santiago, Armijo and Monreal (1965a) found that 186 pregnancies in every thousand (excluding induced abortions so that the denominator contained only fetuses at risk) reportedly ended in spontaneous abortion. Requena (1965a) published data, also from Santiago, which yielded a rate of 146. Most of their difference was evidently due to Requena's inquiry having extended back a full ten years with consequent memory loss and lower ages and parities; the rural rate dropped nearly 30% when lifetime reproductive histories were considered. Correcting Requena's figure by this proportion would yield a rate almost identical to Armijo and Monreal's.
The urban rates calculated were more than double the rural one of 87 and would still have been significantly higher (p < 0.001) even if induced abortions had been included in the denominator. Since the interview method was the same, the discrepancy apparently resulted from environmental conditions or differences between the city and country women. Although multiple factors may have contributed, it is difficult not to conclude that respondents in Santiago frequently claimed that their criminal abortions were spontaneous.
The rural rate of 6 induced abortions per

1,000 pregnancies is likely an underestimate too; but the combination of high fertility, low reported spontaneous abortion rate, and fairly extensive contraceptive practice (see below) in the region indicates that the abortion problem there was not nearly of the magnitude reported for the rest of Chile (Armijo and Monreal, 19656/ Requena, 1965a; Requena and Monreal, 1968; Viel, 1969).
CONTRACEPTION
The health and financial burden from illegal abortions led the Chilean National Health Service to begin incorporating family planning into its activities in 1963. These efforts were concentrated in the cities, of course, so the finding that 33.0% of the rural couples were currently practicing contraception was unexpected. More importantly, the result demonstrates that even in the absence of such an intensive program as that of San Gregorio (Faundes, Rodriquez, and Avendano 1968), included abortion is not inevitably the initial phase in the evolution of family planning acceptance as Requena (1968) hypothesized from previous Chilean and international data. Rather, abortion may emerge as a problem only when effective contraceptives are not available to a population motivated to limit or space births.
The level of contraceptive use reported

here corroborates contemporary findings in two other rural areas (Schulz, 1968; Hall, 1970), but is quite different from those obtained 5 or 6 years earlier in Colina (CELADE, 1965) and Santiago (Requena, 19656) (Table 5).
The earlier authors found far fewer contraceptors and much less efficient methods being used. Since then, oral contraceptives and IUD's have gained rapid and diffuse acceptance. As Table 6 shows, these two

law wives included) were asked, so the calculation that 11.7% of all women aged 20-24 were using pills or IUD's represents a minimum. The rate for the same age group, regardless of marital status, in urban Santiago was estimated at 11.2% only two years before (Monreal and Armijo, 1968).
Of those using IUD's and pills, 66.1% said they were provided by the National Health Service while the rest indicated other health agencies, private physicians, or pharmacists directly. Among those naming the Service, fewer than a third used oral contraceptives in contrast to almost 70% of those cared for by private doctors. These two groups also differed in that twice as many private as Service patients had employed their method for two years or more. Although part of the difference may have resulted from a lower dropout rate for private patients, the data are consistent with the trend to incorporate contraceptive care into Service activities during the past several years. The integration has apparently been greatly facilitated by the inclusion of family planning rationale and methods in Chilean medical curricula. Recently graduated physicians and midwives assigned to the regional hospitals recognize contraception as an integral component of their health care responsibility.
FAMILY PLANNING ATTITUDES
The 1,711 women who were asked their thoughts on including family planning among their posts' activities were 89.2% in favor, 8.5% opposed, and 2.3% without opinion. Those favoring the policy did so principally on the basis of the economic difficulties of feeding, clothing, and educating children in the straits in which they saw themselves. Lesser numbers cited the health needs of mothers, the dangers of induced abortion, or the rights of couples to determine and spacing of their children. One cited the population explosion.

Opposition originated almost entirely in religious and health concerns, with moral objections about twice as common as fears of health hazards from contraceptive use. Religious opposition among the 3,100 Catholics was less than half that of the 293 Evangelists and other Protestants (4.6% vs. 10.3% ) . Clearly, at least in this population, Catholicism is not the obstacle it is stereotyped to be.
Among the 1,817 women who were asked the alternative question of whether or not education on how to prevent pregnancy ought to be available to any married woman wanting it, 81.7% were in favor, 16.9% opposed, and 1.4% without opinion. While married women were considerably more favorable than single women (86.7% vs. 76.7%) on this question, those in consensual union were the least so (71.1%). (Some in these latter 2 groups objected to the question's implicitly excluding them from the privilege, arguing that married women needed contraception less than the unmarried). But even the common-law wives were more receptive than the rural men (54%) in Hall's sample (Hall, 1971). Although those with 9 or more years of education were more favorable than others, no linear correlation with years of schooling was noted. By age, the youngest and the oldest were the least favorable and those 25 to 29 the most so, apparently reflecting the woman's perception of her own immediate benefit. Eighty per cent of respondents thought that schools should offer family planning education, but there was no consensus on the appropriate age for this education.
DISCUSSION
The moderate birth rate of these communities was determined by multiple factors among which the population structure, affected by selective emigration of young women, was one. A second was the complex

158

Plank and Milancsi

of sodoeconomic forces leading to fertility control motivation. Rural Chileans are probably less bound by traditionalism than are the dtizens of most developing countries and literacy rates are high; about 80% of the respondents claimed that they could read. Also, more than half of them thought that the economic situation of the region was worse than it used to be, and economic duress was the most frequently cited reason for favoring family planning.
Contraception was the third major influence on natality. Modern, effective contraceptives were available to the population through their health services. While it is obvious that these would have accomplished little in the absence of motivation, they facilitated achieving family-limiting objectives where these existed and prevented such motivation from being channeled into illegal abortions. Chile has a relatively large number of physidans and universitytrained midwives and through its National Health Service has sought for an equitable access to their services. These professionals consider fertility regulation as part of their responsibilities. Even in the fairly remote villages, the majority of mothers had been delivered in hospitals and others had had prenatal or infant care at their local posts. Such contact with the health sector appears to have been directly responsible for the use by a quarter of all couples of pills, IUD's, and surgical sterilization. Since these most effective methods are medically dependent, the frequently neglected factor of health care should be recognized as a key variable in studies of human fertility.
SUMMARY
Conditions are described in IS rural Chilean communities with 21,246 inhabitants at the beginning of a prospective controlled study of the effects of family plan-

ning programs on natality and health. From the census data and interviews with 3,528 women aged 15--44, the general fertility rate in 1968 was estimated at about 192 ·while the birth rate was only 33, due to the emigration of young women. Delayed marriage was characteristic of those who stayed. Even including common-law wives, only about half of the women of reproductive age were married, and 15% were still spinisters at ages 40-44. This pattern was distinct from other parts of Latin America. Illegitimacy was also below the regional norms, although more than half of first conceptions occurred before marriage and one single woman in 8 was a mother.
Nearly 90% of the respondents favored having family planning included among the activities of their local health posts, and a third of all couples were already controlling their fertility. The great majority (75%) of these couples were employing the pill, the IUD, or had been surgically sterilized. Induced abortion was only a minor fraction of its magnitude in urban Chile, and with the increasing availability of modern contraceptives may never emerge as a problem. The relatively high use rate of effective contraception was attributed in large part to the incorporation of family planning into medical curricula and into the comprehensive maternal-infant programs of the Chilean National Health Service.
