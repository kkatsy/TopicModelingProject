Social Biology and its sponsoring society have reaped more than reasonable shares of benefits from the largely unrewarded efforts of our currently retiring Editor, Richard H. Osborne. It is appropriate therefore that we now firmly set down our obligations and our gratefulness so that his prodigious efforts no longer go unheralded.
Since 1961, Richard H. Osborne has been Editor of this journal, bringing it to maturity in both size and scope from its early days as the slender arm of the American Eugenics Society when it was titled Eugenics Quarterly.2 At that time, the journal published only solicited manuscripts, and it was he who wisely terminated this restriction in order to sample better "the push and direction of thought in the [entire] scientific community."
In the past seventeen years, the journal has grown and prospered under his direction, achieving both national and international prominence for its publication of original research in the biological and social sciences. In addition, the journal has been a leader in helping to define the new area of social biology.
Today Social Biology draws both contributors and subscribers from all over the globe. It is now a self-supporting sci-

entific journal, abstracted and indexed by all the major services and represented in the Council of Biology Editors. Perhaps the most succinct indicator of the journal's development under Dick's editorship lies in the compilation of substantive primary periodicals in the biological sciences made in 1970 by the Council on Biological Sciences Information. After applying their criteria for research content, availability in national and foreign libraries, and listing by the major announcement services, they classified only 190 journals published in the United States as primary serial publications in the biological sciences. Social Biology was one of these few.
And Dick Osborne has not nourished Social Biology in a vacuum. During his editorship, he has held elected offices in the American Society of Human Genetics, the American Association of Physical Anthropology, the International Society of Cranio-Facial Biology, and the American Eugenics Society. He was Chairman of the Organizing Committee when the American Eugenics Society sponsored the formation of the Behavior Genetics Association and served as President Pro Tern of the fledgling association. He has also served on committees for the National Institutes of Mental Health, the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, and the National Research Council.

These assignments reflect a broadness of training, his degrees attesting to competence in more than one area of the life sciences. His doctoral degree, for one instance, was earned at Columbia University's Institute for the Study of Human Variation; it was awarded as an interdepartmental doctorate in genetics, anthropology, and the health sciences. Through the years, his primary research interests have been in genetic-environment interaction in both health and disease.
Since 1964, Dick has been Professor of Physical Anthropology and of Medical Genetics at the University of WisconsinMadison.3 Prior to that appointment, he was Head of the Human Genetics Section of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research. For his work in cancer, he received the Career Scientist Award from the Health Research Council of the City of New York. He has also taught in the departments of preventive medicine at Cornell University Medical School and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and has held research and hospital appointments at the Forsyth Dental Center, Newington Children's Hospital, the University of Connecticut, Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases, and Columbia University.
He has coauthored, edited, or coedited no fewer than four well-received books, three of them during his tenure as Editor:
OSBORNE, R. H., and F. V. D E GEORGE. 1959. Ge-
netic basis of morphological variation. Harvard University, Cambridge.
OSBORNE, R. H., ed. 1961. Genetic perspectives in disease resistance and susceptibility. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 91:595818.
'Professor Emeritus, 1985-present.

LAUGHLIN, W. L., and R. H. OSBORNE, eds. 1968.
Human variation and origins. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco.
OSBORNE, R. H., ed. 1971. Biological and social meaning of race. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco.
His publications in the form of journal ar-
ticles number more than three dozen with
some selected for anthological reprinting.
Other pertinent publications and activities
on Dick's part as they relate to the society
are discussed in Frederick Osborn's "His-
tory of the American Eugenics Society
(Social Biology, 1974, Vol. 21, No. 2, pp.
115-126).
It is perhaps appropriate to conclude
by switching from retrospect to prospect.
Looking back at his seventeen years of dedicated service (1961-1977)4, the Offi-
cers and Board of Directors of the Soci-
ety for the Study of Social Biology wish
to express their profound appreciation to
Richard H. Osborne for the building of a
fine scientific journal for the society.
Looking toward the future, we sincerely
hope that he will continue to use his
many talents in fostering the goals of the
society as he has so generously and so
ably done in the past.
4Richard Osborne's second term as Editor of Social Biology,1982-1999, is discussed separately on pp. 172178 of this issue. He continues his work on geneticenvironment interaction in human health and disease through research appointments at the School of Medicine, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland, and at the Alaska Quaternary Center, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, Alaska. He also continues active participation in research ongoing at the American Museum of Natural History, New York City.
In ceremonies in Oulu in May 1994, Osborne received an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Oulu for his contributions to genetic-odontometric studies. In ceremonies in Fairbanks in May 2001, he will receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Alaska for his contributions to science.
Richard Osborne had made his home in Washington since 1989 (at 1129 East Eighth Street, Port Angeles, WA 98362) and can be reached by e-mail through his Columbia University address (rho6@columbia.edu).
