that the two sets of families compared were living in the same villages with approximately the same life style.
Frederick Hulse, in a study of Italianspeaking Swiss in both Switzerland and the United States, found that village endogamous unions produced more children than did village exogamous unions, whether in Switzerland or in the United States (Hulse, 1957). Similarly, Bresler reported that among New England whites fetal loss increased with the number of countries represented in the great-grandparents' genera-

tion (Bresler, 1970). The results of these two studies are in the opposite direction to that of Boas. The Hulse and Bresler studies suffer most obviously from the fact that age at marriage is uncontrolled. We know that those people who marry further out tend also to marry at a later age. This fact alone could explain the findings.
In short, while it may be true that a significant dominance deviation exists for fertility in some populations, a study with adequate controls to demonstrate such a finding has not been done.

Demography, to be presented for the second are no specific requirements as to age,na-

time in 1976 and every second year thereafter. The award has been established by the Mindel C. Sheps Memorial Fund and is sponsored by the Population Association of America and the University of North Carolina School of Public Health. I t is given in recognition of outstanding contributions to mathematical demography or demographic methodology.
Individuals should be nominated for this award on the basis of important contributions to knowledge, either in the form of a single piece of work or a continuing record of high accomplishment. The award is in-

tionality, or place of residence, nor is the award restricted to members of the Population Association of America.
The award is named for Mindel C. Sheps who, at her death in January, 1973, was Professor of Biostatistics at the University of North Carolina School of Public Health and Second Vice-President of the Population Association of America. She enjoyed a distinguished career as physician, biostatistician, and demographer, applying mathematics and statistics to studies in these areas.

Lalor Foundation Research Fellowship Program for 1976

The Lalor Foundation has announced its 1976 program of postdoctorate grants for research in special areas of mammalian reproductive physiology.
The Foundation will make grants up to $13,500 each to qualified tax-exempt institutions for conduct of approved projects up to one year. Foreign institutions can in general achieve a similar eligibility.
The applicant institution has the obligation and freedom to make its own designation of a Lalor Fellow for conduct of the research from among its own personnel or elsewhere. The Fellow designated should have achievement at least equivalent to the

Ph.D. or M.D. degree. Upper age limit is 35 years.
Applications are restricted to research projects bearing on: (a) early amniocentesis in fetal development, or other means for detection and evaluation of dysgenic factors or congenital disabilities, and means toward their disposition; or (6) uterine and cervical physiology and phenomena relevant to pregnancy interruption, particularly for second trimester terminations.
Forms and details for institution application are available from the Lalor Foundation, 4400 Lancaster Pike, Wilmington, Delaware, 19805.
