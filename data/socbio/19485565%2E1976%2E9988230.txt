Childlessness, Health, and Marital Satisfaction

ABSTRACT: Data on the health and well-being of 2,480 married couples in an urban areaprobability sample suggest that parenthood detracts from the physical and psychological health of husbands and wives, particularly among younger couples. Rates of joint marital satisfaction also were lower for active parents than for former parents and childless couples, regardless of the duration of the marriage and the wife's age and employment status. That parenthood may be detrimental to both health and marital satisfaction is suggested by the finding that former parents were better off than active parents on both indices, though not as well off as childless spouses.

Back in 1947, data from the 1941 Indianapolis fertility study were published showing that childless couples were happier with their marriages than couples raising children (Reed, 1947). Since then, no one has investigated this relationship with a sample even as representative as the one used for the Indianapolis study. The absence of research in this area doubtless reflects American values for, until recently at least, we have considered childlessness a misfortune, not a way of life any married couples would choose voluntarily.
Most of the large-scale fertility studies conducted in the past thirty years show that very few Americans will say that they prefer to remain childless; few even go so far as to indicate a preference for only one child. Nevertheless, childless marriage is now a fashionable topic, due no doubt to the combined effects of the women's liberation movement, anxiety about overpopulation, and the high cost of rearing children. Ellen Peck's The Baby Trap (1972) reached a large audience, and childless marriage has been advocated with enthusiasm by journalists (e.g., Rollin, 1970)

and popular psychologists (Silverman and Silverman, 1971). Even McCall's magazine, a stronghold of traditional femininity, recently printed a sympathetic account of the activities of the National Organization for Non-Parents (Lester, 1974).
Scholarly attention to childless marriage has largely been confined to its incidence (still low) and to its demographic correlates (e.g., Whelpton et al., 1966; Kiser et al., 1968), although the previous tendency to treat childlessness stricly as a manifestation of sterility has been replaced by attention to "voluntary" childlessness (Gustavus and Henley, 1971; Veevers, 19716, 1973; Rao, 1974). But sociologists have rarely discussed, much less investigated, childlessness as a factor in marital satisfaction, despite Peck's argument to the effect that mothers make unsatisfactory wives and Rossi's influential "Transition to Parenthood" (1968) which explored the many negative consequences motherhood has for the health and well-being of women.
The possibility that the first child creates a difficult situation ("trauma") for its parents has been explored, inconclu-

sively, in a series of small nonrepresentative samples (results summarized by Jacoby, 1969). Dissatisfaction with the spouse and with the marriage increased after the birth of the first child in two independent panel samples drawn from predominantly white, middle-class, urban populations (Feldman, 1971; Ryder, 1973). But the relation between marital satisfaction and parental status has evidently not been investigated in a large representative sample since the 1941 Indianapolis study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data I shall present here were taken from a large area-probability sample of households in Alameda County, California, in 1965. These data were collected by the Human Population Laboratory of the California State Department of Public Health, whose publications (California Department of Public Health, 1966, and Hochstim and Athanasopoulos, 1970) describe the sampling procedure and the sample in detail. Generalization from this sample to other American metropolitan areas is legitimate; for even though Alameda County may be distinctive with respect to population characteristics such as ethnicity, age, and occupation, there is no evidence that within this population relationships involving the major variables presented here are markedly different from those in similar populations elsewhere.
In an earlier publication from this study (Renne, 1970), I reported in passing that married persons in this sample who had never had children were happier with their marriages than those who had had children--regardless of race, family income, or duration of marriage. Since then I have discovered that childless couples not only were happier, but those in the younger age groups were healthier as well,

which suggests that factors other than physical malfunctioning may be contributing to childlessness among urban couples.
The present paper is confined to the 2,480 couples in the sample, that is, to those who were married, living with spouse, and whose spouse also returned a questionnaire. The total sample, based on 4,452 households, consisted of 6,928 adults--persons age 20 or older, or ages 16--19 and ever married--who completed a 23-page mail questionnaire concerned primarily with health. For most of the couples there was sufficient information to distinguish childless couples (14 per cent), those rearing children (61 per cent), and those who had had children but were no longer active parents (25 per cent). These three categories comprise the variable "parental status."
Parental status as defined here is primarily a social rather than a biological variable; and it refers to couples, not to individuals. Couples who were living with children classified as their own were considered "active parents"--regardless of whether both spouses, or neither one, were the biological parents--as were individuals who had never had children of their own but were living with the spouse's offspring.
The definition does incorporate a biological element in distinguishing between "childless couples," where neither spouse had ever had children, and "former parents," where at least one spouse had in the past had children. Most of the former parents, of course, were couples whose biological offspring had become adults or had left home; but a divorced and remarried man, for example, whose children had remained with their mother, was classified along with his wife as a former parent unless his household included his current wife's children, in which case both spouses were classified as active parents.
It should be emphasized that the

Alameda County survey was not intended as a study of family characteristics except insofar as they were related to health. Its overall purpose was to investigate the relation between health and "way of life" as represented by a number of social and demographic variables. Race, marital status, income, and occupation were emphasized more than family size, which was used principally to evaluate income adequacy; and the questionnaire did not cover spacing of children, use of birth control, attitudes toward family size, or other characteristics that might account directly for the presence or absence of children.
RESULTS
PARENTAL STATUS AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS
Age and length of marriage.--Childless couples were comparatively young. About

a third of the wives were under age 25, compared with about one in ten of the wives raising children. Former parents, of course, were older--88 per cent of these wives were over age 45, compared with 19 per cent of the active mothers. Table 1 (extreme left-hand column) gives the wives' age distribution in each of the three parental-status groups.
Childless couples were also likely to have married recently, as Table 1 shows; but in the older age groups this difference was not a large one. Among childless couples with wives aged 45-64, 87 per cent had been married at least ten years--not much less than the 92 per cent of active parents in the same age group who had been married that long.
Thus, childlessness was not confined to recent marriages or to a particular age group. It was naturally more common among recent marriages; but when the wife was over age 45, couples married re-

* This table and all subsequent tables are based on questionnaires returned by heads of household and their wives. Twenty-eight couples who were not heads of household were excluded because their parental status could not be determined.
t "Childless" means that neither partner had ever had children. Childless individuals whose partners had had children may have functioned as stepparents and therefore cannot be assumed to have had the same experience as those whose partners had never had children.
t "Former parents" are those who had had children in the past but were not living with any at the time of the survey, or whose children, though still at home, were 16-19 and ever married, or over 19. Children in the latter categories were classified as adults.

cently were no more likely to be childless than those married longer. In this older age group, the rate of childlessness was higher for those married 3-19 years than for those married 20 years or longer. This finding reflects a positive relation between childlessness and age at marriage, also reported by Veevers (19716, 1972a) for ever-married women age 45 and over in Canada in 1961 and by Mitra (1966) for American women in 1960.

Comparison between the age-group totals in Table 2 and rates of childlessness reported for American wives generally (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1974, Table 50) indicates that in 1965 childlessness was more common in Alameda County than in the country as a whole among wives under 25, but not among older wives. Alameda County's rate for wives under 25 was also higher than Rao (1974) reported for comparable age groups in his Rhode Island sample.
These comparisons suggest that young

(1974) and Veevers (1971a) note a decline in childlessness since the 1940's in Rhode Island and the United States respectively, noting that voluntary childlessness was more prevalent during the 1930's (when women over 45 in 1965 were entering their reproductive years) than in the "babyboom" period of the 195O's when women 25-44 in 1965 were entering their reproductive years.
Both Rao and Veevers assume that childlessness will continue to decline, and they attribute the high rates among women under 25 to a delay in first births. Our data show, however, that among those married at least three years, childlessness is, if anything, more common for wives under 25 than for wives 25^4. In other words, by 1965, childlessness was

Race and religion.--The traditional ideological differences between Catholics and Protestants might lead one to expect higher rates of childlessness among Protestants, as Rao (1974) found in Rhode Island; but in Alameda County this higher rate for Protestants occurred only among foreign-born white (including Mexican) wives under 65. (Catholics are a minority in Alameda County and represent different ethnic groups than they do in Rhode Island where they are a majority.) Among native-born white wives there was vir-

tually no difference between Catholics and Protestants, although wives aged 25-44 who claimed no religious affiliation were about three times as likely as Catholics to have remained childless.
Black wives under age 25 were only about half as likely as native white wives under age 25 to be childless (19 per cent vs. 41 per cent); but among wives aged 25-44 Blacks did not differ from whites, and among those over age 45, Black wives were twice as likely as white wives to be childless (25 per cent vs. 12 per cent). A similar age difference also occurred among Catholic wives, which suggests that physiological factors may have contributed to childlessness among older couples of lower socioeconomic status. In this regard, Veevers (1971a) suggests that the rapid decline of childlessness among nonwhite women since 1940 may have been due partly to "improvements in the control of venereal disease."

not consistently support this expectation. Table 3 shows that among younger wives, the college-educated were more likely to be childless, but that among women age 45 and older education had no such effect. Rao (1974) reported a similar pattern for the women in his Rhode Island sample. This finding suggests that female college graduates born after 1920 were more likely than those born earlier to remain childless. The comparisons between childless couples and active parents in Table 3 indicate a possible generational effect, since they show that childless wives under age 45 were more highly educated than active mothers, while among older wives active mothers were more highly educated. To be certain that this finding reflects a declining interest in motherhood among collegeeducated wives, we would, of course, have to know what proportion of the women aged 25-44 in 1965 were still childless 5 to 25 years later.

wives were not in the labor force, however, and the proportion working parttime was about the same for active mothers as for childless wives. Among wives under 45, housewives with full-time work experience were less likely to be childless than other housewives, indicating that motherhood may have induced women in the former category to leave the labor market.
What kind of job the wife had was evidently less important than whether she worked or not. Among working wives aged 25-44, professional and technical workers did have a higher rate of childlessness (25 per cent) than any other group, but among working wives aged 45-64 the rate of childlessness was about 20 per cent regardless of occupation.
In summary, childless couples were

likely to be young, although more than a third were over 45, and married relatively recently, although almost two-fifths had been married more than ten years. A majority of childless wives under age 45 had attended college, compared with less than a third of active mothers under 45; and about half of those under 65 were working full time, compared with about a fourth of active mothers. Neither the husband's occupation nor the wife's was related consistently to the couple's parental status, although in the younger age groups childless spouses were somewhat more likely than active parents to be in the higher-status white-collar occupations.

assumption being that any "normal" woman would have at least one child if she could.1 Even in 196S, this attitude was prevalent enough to warrant the assumption that some large proportion of the childless couples in the Alameda County

Mayer (1954, p. 20) found only 10 women (3 per cent) who had never had children among the 340 women over age 45. This finding suggests that the 10 per cent sterility rate usually cited for American couples (e.g., Freedman et al., 1959, p. 18; Whelpton et al., 1966, Chapter 4) may overestimate the amount of physiologically-based childlessness in the population. Rao (1974, p. 156) found only 22 women (4 per cent) who said that it was not physically possible for them to have children among 555 wives ages 30-49, and an equal number were evidently childless by choice. Similarly, Veevers (1972b) estimated that no more than 50 per cent of childless couples in Canada in 1961, or about 5 per cent of married women, were
physiologically unable to have children.

population were childless for reasons beyond their control, particularly in the older age groups, although we have no data with which to check this assumption. If childlessness in this population were a function of physiological impairment, however, one would expect to find that childless couples reported more physical health problems than those who had had children.
On the contrary, Table S shows that childless wives and husbands were less likely than active parents to report physical disabilities, impairments, chronic illnesses, or other physical symptoms.2 These differences are small, but they occurred in every age group under 65. The small differences in the 45-64 age group and the reversal after age 65--and particularly the large proportions of childless husbands and wives in the over-65 group who reported two or more chronic illnesses or a disability--do suggest that childlessness was associated with poor health in the past.
Among older people then (in this sample, those older than the median age of 45 years), most childlessness was probably not voluntary, but due primarily to physiological impairment. Although we have no direct evidence that childlessness was more likely to be voluntary among younger couples than among older couples, it seems more reasonable to infer that it was voluntary than to conclude that sterility was more common among younger persons without other health problems than it was when the older wives were of childbearing age.
Respondents were asked for a subjective appraisal of their health as well as for specific illnesses and symptoms. Their an-

swers were categorized as shown in Table 6. Again, childless spouses in the younger age groups were healthier, especially wives. Forty-three per cent of childless wives under 25 described their health as excellent or better than that of others the same age, compared with 24 per cent of active mothers under 25; for husbands in this group, the percentages were 56 per cent and 41 per cent. The association between parenthood and poor health, or at least low morale, is evidently stronger for mothers than for fathers.
In each of the three older age groups, however, the difference between childless spouses and active or former parents is successively smaller, and among women over 45, mothers were more likely than childless wives to describe their health as excellent. Again, this finding suggests that childlessness on the part of women born before 1920 was not voluntary and may have been a consequence of poor health. On the other hand, the reversal after age 65 may also reflect the fact that none of the parents in this group were actually raising children.
For women under 45, the association between health and childlessness may reflect a causal process in the opposite direction, that is, it suggests that parenthood may have had a deleterious effect on health or at least on the individual's evaluation of his or her health. Mothers under age 25, for instance, were almost twice as likely as childless wives to describe their health as fair or poor, or worse than that of others the same age.
The parental-status difference for both spouses was larger for the subjective health measure than for the more objective measure based on questions about specific symptoms and illnesses. Lacking any direct evidence on the actual physiological effect of parenthood on health, we may infer that to some large extent these responses represent differ-

* Respondents were asked to check which (if any) disabilities, conditions, and symptoms they had. Disabilities are "functional": trouble feeding or dressing or moving around; inability to work or to work a normal schedule; trouble climbing stairs; etc. Chronic conditions include high blood pressure, heart trouble, bronchitis, rheumatism, diabetes, cancer, etc. Symptoms include pain in the heart or chest, leg cramps, back pains, stomach pains, headaches, paralysis, trouble breathing, constant coughing, etc. impairments--a missing limb, trouble seeing even with glasses or hearing even with a hearing aid--are included with chronic conditions here.)
In this table, people with two or more chronic conditions or impairments are classified "chronically ill"; those with only one chronic condition are grouped with those who reported one or more symptoms. All persons reporting a disability are in the first 'category, "Disabled or chronically ill."

* Respondents were asked: "Is your health better or worse than the health of most other people your age?" and "All in all, would you say that your health is generally excellent, good, fair, or poor?" Answers to these questions were combined to make the four categories shown in this table.

ences in morale rather than health. Husbands' and wives' responses to eight questions about emotional or "feeling" states (e.g., how often they felt "very lonely or remote from other people," "bored," "on top of the world," etc.) support this inference. In all four age groups, childless wives and husbands were more likely than active parents to display a relatively high level of psychological well-being, and those under 45 were also less likely to display an absence of well-being.3
PARENTAL STATUS AND MARITAL HAPPINESS
Knowing that childless couples tended to enjoy better health and higher morale, we should not be surprised to find that they were happier with their marriages, and indeed they were. Responses from both spouses to six questions about their marriages were scored in such a way as to yield three groups: the "unhappily married," who expressed serious dissatisfaction; the "happily married," who expressed no dissatisfaction at all or had only minor complaints; and an intermediate group who could be classified as neither happily nor unhappily married. For example, a wife who said she had seriously considered divorce or separation recently would be classified as unhappily married, no matter how she answered the other five questions, while a wife who said she sometimes regretted her marriage would be classified in the intermediate group unless she also expressed more serious dissatisfaction in responding to other questions. All respondents in the "happily married" group described their marriages as happy "all in all" and said they had never regretted their marriages.4
In a comparison of active parents with childless couples, as couples, the largest

4 This index and its correlates are described in detail in Renne (1970).

difference is in the proportions of both spouses who were happily married. Forty-five per cent of the childless couples agreed in assessing their marriage as happy, compared with only 24 per cent of active parents; and both spouses expressed serious dissatisfaction in 13 per cent of the active-parent marriages, compared with 6 per cent of childless marriages. Number of children made less difference in the percentage happily married than simple parental status, a finding also reported by Reed (1947).
Controlling for wife's age does not affect this relationship, although the difference between childless couples and active parents was smallest in the 45-64 age group. Duration of marriage does affect the relationship, however, as Table 7 shows. Among couples married 10-19 years, childless couples were only slightly more likely than active parents to be happy with their marriages; rates of joint happiness were low in this time period for all couples, and rates of joint unhappiness were high.
Low rates of marital happiness (or satisfaction) have been associated in other studies not with the duration of marriage but with the presence of school-age children (see Rollins and Feldman, 1970, for a summary of several of these studies). But our finding that even childless marriages of 10-19 years duration were less satisfactory than others suggests that it is not the couple's "life-cycle" stage (i.e., children's ages) but rather the duration of marriage itself that is associated with satisfaction. (Rollins and Feldman (1970) excluded childless couples from their own study on the grounds that they were "atypical.")
For durations shorter than ten years or longer than twenty, however, childless couples retained a clear advantage over active parents and former parents alike. Differences were largest in early marriages
