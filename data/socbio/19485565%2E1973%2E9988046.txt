Genetics
An Epidemiologic Justification for Genetic Counseling in Family Planning. H. A. Sultz et al. Amer. J. Pub. Hlth., 62(1972):1489-1492.
The presence of a chronically ill child in a family does not naturally induce either restriction or compensation in number of subsequent births. In an upstate New York population, the annual fertility rate of 291 mothers after diagnosis of chronic disease in a child was higher than in control families, but not significantly so. Fertility decreased significantly in a subsample of 62 where the diagnosis was a genetic condition with high recurrence risk, and also in a subsample of 25 that obtained family counseling. Genetic counseling was not available.

COMMENT: The author does not say how she estimated recurrence risks from twin data. The pairwise concordance rates would underestimate the risks.
Correlation in Liability among Relatives and Concordance in Twins. Further Results. C. Smith. Human Hered., 22(1972):97-1O1.
This paper extends earlier predictions of the familial incidence of threshold traits to conditions occurring in more than 10% of the population. It also explores the relations between three measures of twin concordance. Genetic interpretation of concordance, always difficult, is not facilitated by Holzinger's famous index of heritability.

Empiric Risks for Genetic Counseling in Families with Allergy. M. E. Lubs. / . Pediat., 80(1972):26-31.
The genetic influence in allergy is much smaller than has often been supposed, but if a person has severe or multiple allergies, the risk for his children may be as high as 12%. A family history questionnaire was completed by 7,000 pairs of adult twins from the Swedish twin registry. The pairwise concordance rate for different allergies varied in monozygotic twins from 10% to 21% and in dizygotic twins from 1% to 14%. The DZ rates are only a little higher than population prevalences.

Immunoglobulins, Secretor Status, and the Incidence of Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic Heart Disease. F. J. Grundbacher. Human Hered., 22(1972) :399404.
The relatively greater susceptibility to rheumatic fever observed in persons of the nonsecretor phenotype may be due to a reduced level of circulating antibodies. A lowered level of immunoglobulin G found in Michigan is confirmed in a Virginia population. The deficiency is significant in both whites and blacks, but is more marked in whites.

Inherited Uterine Inadequacy: An Alternate Explanation for a Portion of Cases of Defect. F. M. Ahern and R. C. Johnson. Behav. Genet., 3(1973): 1-12.
Some portion of undifferentiated familial mental deficiency may result from hereditary reproductive malfunction in women. Comparison of male and female relatives of defectives shows that the latter have a higher frequency of both mental retardation and perinatal mortality among their offspring. Exclusion of retarded relatives from tabulations lowers the frequencies, but has little effect on the sex differences.
COMMENT: Such highly heritable reproductive malfunction is hardly compatible with natural selection. The higher marriage rate oj female than of male borderline defectives might explain these findings on the usual basis of genetic and cultural transmission of intelligence and the correlation of intelligence with obstetric care.
Genetics of Uricemia: A Study of Three Indian Tribes of French HauteGuayne. (In French) E. Bois and J. Feingold. Ann. Genet., 15(1972):257264.
Some South American Indians have high blood levels of uric acid, and this appears to be at least partly genetic. Among 110 healthy representatives of three tribes, 30.9% had levels that would be considered abnormal among Europeans. Environmental effects were in the wrong direction to explain the difference, since subjects who lived near culturally modern areas had the higher uric acid levels.
The Finnish Population Structure. A Genetic and Genealogical Study. H. R.

Nevanlina. Hereditas, 71(1972): 195236.
The pattern of variation in frequency of marker genes indicates that breeding populations in Finland have been small, averaging a few hundred, since the initial wide dispersal of the population founders. A nationwide survey made use of military servicemen, and intensive studies were conducted in seven communities. The average inbreeding coefficient is 0.0087. Atypical frequencies of many rare genes in Finland confirm the large effects of genetic drift.
COMMENT: A combination of history, homogeneity, and until recently, stability, make the Finnish population unique in Europe. It has been wisely utilized in this excellent study.
The Evolutionary Development of Modifier Genes. S. Karlin and J. McGregor. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA), 69(1972): 3611-3614.
Minor genes that modify genetic parameters like mutation rate are subject to positive and negative natural selection within a population, even though they have no fitness value for the individual. The mathematically demonstrable effect is to maximize the mean fitness of the whole population at equilibrium, but the selection pressure is feeble.
Competition, Competitive Repulsion, and Coexistence. P. J. Darlington, Jr. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA), 69(1972): 3151-3155.
Terms referring to competition, resources, or ecological niches are more ambiguous than is commonly recognized, and writers should define them carefully for any particular application. "Extended competition" is suggested to describe a spec-

trum of "weapons of competition" including predation and even cooperation. Among other ideas that need wider currency, niches are delimited not by the environment, but by the organisms that occupy them.

lated rules of gene interaction are applicable only in a coherent, wild population, whereas inbred strains contain peculiarly selected genes, quite unrepresentative of any natural gene pool.

Water-Escape in Weanling Rats: A Link Between Behavior and Biological Fitness. J. Wilcock. Anim. Behav., 20 (1972): S43-S47.

Crosses among five laboratory strains of fruit fly showed unimpaired complementarity ("heterosis") between chromosomes of different geographic origin. Previous experimenters, using other species, have found heterosis only when the homologous chromosomes came from the same gene pool, signifying slight genetic incompatibility between geographic races.
COMMENT: The fly strains used here had been established each from one inseminated female, and one strain had been maintained in the laboratory for at least four years. They may therefore not adequately represent natural populations. But this is not an important objection, and the findings are consonant with those on human race crossing.
Behavioral Adaptation and Biometrical Genetics. S. C. Maxson. Amer. Psychol., 28 (1073): 268-269.
The diallel cross technique commonly used in genetic analysis of inbred strains of animals is not likely to yield information about the survival value of traits, as some experimenters have supposed. The postu-

An attempt to validate inferences about survival value from crosses between laboratory strains (see preceding abstract) was mainly successful. Young hybrid rats escaped from water more rapidly than the inbred parent strains, indicating the expected dominance of a trait important for survival in nature (rats often live near water). However, no dominance was evident when genetic analysis was limited to the animals' first encounter with water, and this raises some doubts.
