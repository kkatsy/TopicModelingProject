ABSTRACT: Married women in Benighat, Nepal stressed old age security and continuity of lineage as prominent reasons for wanting sons. In addition, women clearly desired daughters too--an important finding that is less often stressed. Religious reasons and help with household chores were the most common reasons reported for wanting a daughter. Strong desires for sons could increase fertility in settings where fertility is controlled. Additional desires for daughters could have an additional pronatalist influence. For Benighat we document a pervasive desire for at least two sons and at least one daughter. If realized, these sex composition preferences would increase fertility by 50 per cent. Actual effects are no doubt smaller, but the effects of sex preference on the desire for more children and on contraceptive use are clearly visible.

I do not have any son. I could not bear a son. God haspunished meand will continue to punish me evenafter my death because there is no son to look afterme in this state of mineand also no son for the salvation of my soul after the death. So, I am aliving dead.
The words above were spoken by an elderly Benighat woman who lived alone and still performed all of the household chores. Her comments illustrate two of the reasons commonly given for wanting sons: to support parents in their old age and to perform religious rites for deceased parents. But in Benighat, parents value daughters too. In this village we document a widespread desire for at least two sons and at least one daughter. If couples could realize this desire, then family size would be relatively small (three children per woman). But sex composition cannot be readily controlled1

and, as a result, some couples will have more than three births before achieving their desired sex composition. A decision rule of "stopping" childbearing only after two sons and one daughter have been born, produces an average family size of 4.38 (see Sheps, 1963; Bongaarts and Potter, 1983). Thus, sex composition desires could inflate fertility, in this example by (4.38 - 3.0 =) 1.38 births per woman.2
This paper documents sex composition desires and their pervasiveness in a Nepali hill area. Our evidence comes from micro-demographic research that combines survey research, direct observation, in-depth interviews, and
areas of India and elsewhere in Asia (see Park and Cho, 1995, pp. 79-80), this technology was not known by, or available to, the people of Benighat in 1988. If this technology were to become available and to be used, then effects of sex preference on fertility would be reduced but unbalanced sex ratios might result (see Park and Cho, 1995).
2We have assumed that the "stopping rule" is to continue bearing children until 2 boys and 1 girl have been born. The impact of such rules provide an upper bound for the effect of sex preference (McClelland, 1979, p. 381).

case studies. The study area is in the midst of a fertility transition. Using the survey data to be described later, Niraula (1990) estimated that the total fertility rate declined from 6.4 in 1976/78 to 5.3 in 1983/86. Contraceptive prevalence among married women who want no more children was 23 per cent in 1989; couples with higher socioeconomic status were the main users. The primary contraceptive method was male sterilization. Data more recently collected in Benighat suggest further declines in fertility and increases in contraceptive use (see Morgan and Niraula, 1995).
The onset of the fertility transition is not limited to our study population. Recent studies indicate that after prolonged high fertility, fertility has started to decline in Nepal (Tuladhar, 1989; Niraula, 1990; His Majesty's Government [HMG], 1993). The total fertility rate was estimated at 6.1 in 1975 and at 5.1 in 1990 (His Majesty's Government [HMG], 1977, 1993). Other indicators provide further support for claims that fertility has declined recently. For example, knowledge of family planning methods has increased considerably: as of 1990, 9 out of 10 women of reproductive age, knew at least one method of contraception. Contraceptive prevalence rates among currently married, nonpregnant women have increased from 3 per cent in 1976, to 15 per cent in 1986, and to 24 per cent in 1991 (HMG, 1987, 1991). Similarly, literacy rates among women have increased from 11 per cent in 1971 to 25 per cent in 1991 (Central Bureau of Statistics, 1992). The Nepali government has also been attempting to provide basic health care facilities to its population. These ef-

forts have increased survival prospects for children, reducing somewhat the demand for large families. Legal provisions, such as minimum age at marriage, have also been introduced. All these factors may have contributed to recent fertility declines in Nepal.
Sex preference in transitional settings may impede the fertility transition. One can also think of sex preference as a measure/consequence of gender inequality. Findings in this paper lead us to conclude that gender differentiation of tasks and roles is so great that the roles of sons and daughters cannot be interchanged. Couples in Benighat conceptualize family size desires not as a single number but as a minimum number of surviving adult sons and daughters. This frame of reference has relevance for population policies and programs in Nepal, a country which may be in the midst of the transition from high to low fertility.
BACKGROUND
PREVIOUS STUDIES ON SEX
PREFERENCES
Social scientists have shown sustained interest in sex preference (see Sheps, 1963; Coombs et al., 1975; Williamson, 1976; Cleland et al., 1983; Arnold, 1985, 1991; Bongaarts and Potter, 1985; Lightbourne, 1985; McClelland, 1979, 1983a, 19836; Levine, 1987; Rahman and DaVanzo, 1993). A preference for sons is widespread, especially in South Asia, East Asia, and in some areas of the Middle East and North Africa (Williamson, 1976; Arnold, 1991). More specifically, there is strong evidence of son preference in Nepal and within the hill region of

Nepal on which we focus (Karki, 1988). But it is rare even in these areas for women to say that they want no daughters.
While there is a strong consensus on the existence of sex preference, there is less agreement on whether sex preference substantially increases fertility. Briefly, Arnold (1991), in an analysis of the 1991 DHS data, finds weak evidence of sex preference effects on fertility across countries, but McClelland (1979,19836) points out that the most commonly used strategies for assessing effects are flawed, usually seriously underestimating the effects of sex preference. Formally, the pronatalist impact of a particular sex preference depends on the degree of fertility control and on the degree of control over the sex of children which are born (McClelland, 1983a). If the former is high and the latter low, then sex preference could exert a powerful influence. Sex preference will exert a powerful influence if the desire for certain sex compositions overwhelms concerns about the number of children. Thus, the impact of sex preference is specific to particular contexts--those with substantial fertility control, those without effective control of sex of children, and those where sex composition is relatively important vis-a-vis number of children. We will argue that the transitional setting we study, Benighat, has these features.
Explanations for the existence and persistence of sex preference are also specific to particular contexts. Williamson (1976) outlines possible parental motivations for son preference under the broad headings: economic, social, and psychological. The relative importance of these broad categories or of particular elements within them could

vary from setting to setting. Few studies provide thorough explanations for the existence and persistence of sex preference. Instead, most social demographic work has been aimed at measuring sex preference or estimating its impact on fertility as opposed to identifying reasons for its existence. In this paper we focus on both the socialeconomic-cultural basis and the fertility impact of sex preference.
BENIGHAT
Ecologically, Nepal is divided into three parallel regions: the mountains, the hills, and the terai (plains) each running from east to west. The hills, with roughly 46 per cent of the total population in 1991 (CBS, 1992) have been considered the heart of Nepali culture and society. Our data are taken from the Benighat Survey, 1988 (Niraula, 1991). The study area lies 75 km southwest of Kathmandu in the central hills.
The village (or gaon) is the most common term for referring to a settlement or cluster of settlements. These villages can vary in size from 2-3 households to hundreds of households. Our data were collected in eight main settlement clusters where we interviewed all women aged 15-54. Within these main settlement clusters, there are many more subsettlement areas (or compounds) often delineated by caste and ethnicity or by stream and topography.
Our study can be usefully compared to one by Karki (1988). His study was conducted in the hill region about ten years earlier than our study. His respondents lived in Gorkha, a rural district, and Pokhara, a town of 36,000 at the time of the 1979 survey. Our study

site lies roughly halfway between Pokhara and Kathmandu. A focus of the Karki study was sex preference, and many of our empirical findings are consistent with those he reports. But, as we note in the discussion, our assessments of the import of sex preference are different.
Culturally, the study area is a microcosm of the central hill Nepali society. All major caste-ethnic groups are represented in the study population. Caste-ethnicity is an ascribed characteristic and is the basis for traditional social stratification in Nepal. It is somewhat related to the Indian caste system based on the Varna. Casteethnic groups represented include Bahun, Chhetri, Kami, Damai, Newar, Gurung, Chepang, Muslims, and others. Bahun is the highest caste, followed by Chhetri. Kami and Damai, who were untouchables (and still are in practice even though prohibited by law), belong to the lowest strata of the society. The indigenous and tribal populations, which are scattered in different pockets of the Kingdom, still maintain their uniqueness despite concerted efforts to bring them into the caste-fold through unification of Nepal and use of Mulki-Ain (civil code). Gurung, Magar, Rai, and Limbu, predominantly Tibeto-Burman groups, belong to this category and are taken as middle castes for the purpose of this study.3 Almost half of our respondents were highercaste Hindus (Bahun and Chhetri). Of the remaining half, 17 per cent were
3This group is usually known as a hill tribal population. While we are not sure of their status in the caste hierarchy, they are usually above the untouchables and below the higher caste Brahman and Chhetris. For details, see Bista 1972; Gaige 1975; Gurung 1989; Hofer 1979; Bishop 1990.

from the Tibeto-Burman group, about 15 per cent were service caste untouchables, and the remainder form a heterogenous residual group. The form and intensity of sex preference could vary by caste (see Williamson, 1976, Chap. 1).
The structure of Nepali society, and Benighat in particular, is patrilineal and patriarchal. These structures encourage son preference and reinforce its existence. To a large extent, a woman's status is tied to her ability to produce children, especially a son. Through her children, a wife gains limited control over her husband and greater autonomy in other spheres of life. A childless woman is pitied.
Niraula (1991) argues that differential socialization for boys and girls starts at a very early age and is maintained throughout the life cycle, thereby maintaining gender segregation and differentiation. Sons are considered as bread-earners while daughters are raised and trained to be good housewives. Educational opportunities reflect the differential opportunities available to males and females in Benighat. The project area is served by a number of primary schools and two high-schools. About 66 per cent of boys and 55 per cent of girls of school age (6-15 years) were attending school. However, as the level of schooling goes up, the percentage of girls in school falls sharply, producing a sex disparity in educational attainment.
The rural agricultural economy makes children an economic asset. As stated earlier, a large majority of people in Benighat depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Seasonality of the agricultural operations make

Sons of any age can claim inheritance rights to their parents' property. But a daughter cannot claim it until age 35, and only then if she remains unmarried. Inheritance of parental property binds sons to the family in both directions. Parents hope that their sons will care for them in their old age, while sons try to maximize the benefits from inheritance (Niraula, 1991,1995).
In terms of development, Benighat provides a changing social context. Since the mid-1970's, Benighat has been linked to Kathmandu and India

The survey questionnaire contained several questions on values and disvalues of having children. One of the open-ended questions asked: Why do you want to have at least one son? We followed the procedures developed for the Value of Children Study (VOC) described by Fawcett et al. (1974) to code this open-ended question.5 Answers were grouped into the following five categories:

1. Old age support 2. Lineage 3. Religious reasons 4. To provide labor 5. Companionship/emotional

Values attached to children are a manifestation of current economic realities and historical/cultural heritage. Nearly two-fifths of the respondent reported that old age support was the prime motive for desiring a son. As in the rural areas of many other developing countries, there are virtually no old age insurance systems instituted by the government or private industries for the general public. Agriculture is the main source of subsistence and sustenance. Saving cash to meet future exigencies is a rarity in this setting. Given these facts, intergenerational transfers by rural householders provide a solution to old age dependency.
The second most important reason given for wanting a son was continuity of lineage, mentioned by 35 per cent of the respondents. As noted earlier, Be-

5Only one response (first) is included in the table. Open-ended questions were coded following sets of values and dis-values developed by Fawcett et al. (1974, p. 4-6) for the Value of Children Study (VOC). However, only a few categories could be used because of the lack of a wide range of answers in different categories and the small number of cases for each category.

nighat is predominantly a Hindu area. Continuity of clan or lineage is considered an important role of progeny in the Hindu religion. The Hindu code of conduct considers continuity as one of the duties of a family member. The continuity of the family name can only be achieved through a male offspring who will keep the title of his father that has been passed from generation to generation.
Closely tied to the lineage or the continuity value of sons is his religious value. People in the Benighat area believe that it is the earnest duty of a son to mourn the death of his parents and to help them achieve moksha (salvation of soul) after their death. A son(s) can do this through observance of appropriate mourning and worship procedures. A couple without a son is called aputro (without a son), and there are many rituals designed to help a couple avoid being aputro.
Other reasons for wanting a son included: help with farm operations or the family business (9 per cent) and companionship (8 per cent). To be assured of a good harvest in seasonal agriculture, the family needs a pool of family labor available for cultivating or harvesting the crop. Family labor is important because there may be no available labor for hire or exchange at the time of peak agricultural operation because all families are busy in their own cultivation. Moreover, certain agricultural tasks such as ploughing, supervising, and arranging labor are gender specific. Only men can perform them.
Lastly, about 8 per cent of respondents in the survey said that they wanted a son for companionship. In Benighat, women gain status through children, and especially sons. Mothers

will be called after their child's name
such as Rame Ki Aama (Ram's
mother). Children, especially sons, are
also a source of power for the younger
mother in communication and bargain-
ing with family elders. It is therefore
not surprising that some respondents
wanted a son mainly for companion-
ship and emotional reasons.
Successful and powerful families in
Benighat have many sons, and villagers
point to them as evidence of the value
of sons.
Mr. Y had four sons and twodaughters. About ten years ago, he was almost bankrupt and was barely able to meet the subsistence needs of the family. Because of the family's deteriorating conditions, the eldest sonleft the household to look for a job. He got a job in India. This was an important transition, and he began to support his family by sending money now and then.
In the village, the agriculture extension service was providing incentives for innovators of new crops, mostly vegetable crops. The eldest son encouraged the family members, especially the next oldest brother, to plant new crops. The initial capital was provided both bythe eldest sonandthe agricultural extension service.
The crop was a success. This was a critical juncture in the success of the family. They continued to take advantage of the new crops which provided cash for the schooling of the two younger sons and the grandchildren. This wealth also enabled Mr. Y to organize the marriage of his daughters.
When the survey team wasin the village, both of the younger sons wereemployed, one as a teacher and the other one in a road construction company. The second son was looking after the farm assisted by his twoyounger brothers and all other family members. Nowadays, Mr. Y is considered one of the

luckiest persons in Benighat with all the luxuries of life. He is very proud of his sons. (From field notes.)
Most of the villagers point to Mr.
Y's household as evidence of the ad-
vantage of having sons. A large num-
ber of successful sons in the village can
increase political power. In a study of a
Tamang community, Fricke (1990, p.
139) noted that "village-wide political
leadership may be thought of as an
extension of the more domestic orders
of prestige and status." The political
benefits of having a large number of
successful sons is illustrated in the fol-
lowing case study in Benighat:
One of the most influential families in Benighat consisted of four sons. The first was the area member of the now dissolved district Panchayat. Thesecond was the president of the farmers organization at thezonal level. Thethirdwas looking after the interest of an estate in the terai and the fourth was the president of the local youth organization. Together, they exercised a strong political, economic, and social force over all other groups. Because of their influence among the people in the village and in the neighborhood, not only were they able to oust powerful rival contenders allied to a powerful lobby group at the national level, but also to strengthen and improve their own position in the village. (From field notes.)

REASONS FOR HAVING DAUGHTERS

Interviewers also asked respondents why they desired daughters. We were surprised by the strength of the desire for at least one daughter. Answers given can be grouped into categories below:

Most respondents gave religious motives for wanting a daughter (41.6 per cent). Hindus attach great importance to marrying their daughter at a relatively young age, especially the higher castes. Marriage of the prepubertal (kanya) virgin daughter is associated with the attainment of punya (merit). That is why daughters are given away as daan (gift), and it is disgraceful to obtain financial or other support from the person who receives the gift. She is paraya dhan (others' property). By marrying-off their daughter at a young age (kanya-daan or gift of a virgin), parents have not only fulfilled an important act of their life-cycle, but have also assured themselves a place in heaven by performing an important duty. Daughters are also considered as a source of wealth (laxmi) and are though to bring good fortune to the family. There is a special festival {Bhai Tika) devoted to the well-being of brothers and sisters.6

A girl's physical development is carefully watched, and her reputation guarded. One reason school attendance for girls declines at higher levels of education is that parents fear emotional and sexual attachments may develop, and they want to avoid any embarrassment that might result from them. These fears lead parents to search for a groom and to marry their daughters at a young age.

6Sisters worship their brothers to ward off devils and back luck as a reciprocity for the protection and help brothers provide to them. Brothers reward their sisters paying due respect. However, modalities of the worship may vary for ethnic groups and caste groups.

Help around the household which includes farm operations and livestock raising is the second most common reason given for wanting a daughter (22.5 per cent). In an agricultural society, demand for labor is high at certain periods of time. In Nepal, women (compared to men) are reported to contribute more labor in agriculture, in caring for livestock, and in housework (Acharya and Bennett, 1981; APROSC, 1992; WDPC, 1992). Young children, and especially daughters, contribute significantly to the labor pool of the family. Young daughters are frequently seen fetching water, fuel, and fodder, or taking care of younger siblings and helping mothers in their errands. Women find relief in a helping hand from a daughter. Not surprisingly, women expressed the importance of help from a daughter as one of the reasons for desiring a daughter.
More than 13 per cent of mothers mentioned companionship and emotional support as the prime reasons for having daughters. Others stressed lineage continuity (15.2 per cent) and old age security (7.4 per cent). Since daughters are given to the grooms as a gift, people do not expect old age support from their daughters. Support from daughters is generally looked down upon by others in the community. It is viewed as "borrowing" from the family to which one has given the daughter. However, if a couple does not have a son, then they must turn to their daughter (and son-in-law) to provide old age support. Existence of tribal-ethnic groups in the population has contributed to the lineage expectations reported in the surveyed population.

Because the values associated with either sons or daughters are not interchangeable, and because of the high value placed on both sons and daughters, pronatalist attitudes permeate the village community. The old age security motive and demand for child labor do not account fully for the pronatalism. Lineage and religious reasons are also important. Therefore, we concur with other researchers that the preponderance of economic theorization has neglected the cultural and normative
values attached to children (Cleland and Wilson, 1987; Levine, 1987;Vlassoff, 1990).
DOCUMENTING THE IMPORTANCE OF
SEX AND COMPOSITIONAL PREFERENCES
Analyses of responses to several questions allow us to demonstrate the existence of son preference and the desire to have at least one daughter. Table 1 shows the cross-classification of answers to two hypothetical questions: If you could begin your life over again, how many daughters would you have? . . . How many sons? The first thing to notice is that the row and column marginals are dissimilar. Women are more than eight times more likely to report " 3 , 4, or 5 + " sons than to report this number of daughters. At the aggregate level then, there is son preference. But without looking within the table, one cannot tell to what extent individual women desire more sons than daughters. At one extreme, there could be two classes of women: those who want only sons and those who want only daughters. The observed marginals could reflect more of the former than the latter. Alternatively, every woman could desire the

number of daughters less than or equal to ( < = ) the number of sons,
Observed frequencies indicate the latter scenario. They show that respondents tend to cluster on or below the main diagonal. Only 10 women report that "if they could start over again" they would have more daughters than sons. In contrast, 377wives report that they would have more sons than daughters; 296 wives report they would have equal numbers of sons and daughters. Thus, both at the aggregate level (the marginals) and for individuals (respondents), there is evidence of widespread son preference.
Characterizations of the data are represented by the selected models in Table 2 and by the "pattern matrix" of the preferred model in Table 3. This pattern matrix captures the important features of the data in Table 1 (e.g., it produces expected frequencies that match the observed data very closely) and represents the preferred model for these data. Specifically, " F " reflects the extent to which row and column marginals are dissimilar. Women are more likely (by a factor of 8.5 = F) to give answers of " 2 , 3, and 4 + " to the son question compared to the daughter question.

Net of these marginal differences, given an answer of 0 to 4 on the daughter question, the odds are raised by a factor of "f" (f = 8.2) that the number of sons is greater than or equal to the number of daughters. In addition, there is a heightened tendency (frequency increased by a factor of 3.2, net of other effects) for women to choose the "one girl-one boy" response. Thus,

the evidence of son preference is unmistakable and is captured by the F and f parameters. Nevertheless, note that few would have no girls. Most women report a desire for one or two girls and for two or more boys.
A second set of questions allows us to address related issues. Married women were asked:
You have sons and daughters. Are you satisfied with this number? Yes No Do you intend to have another child? Yes No Are you currently using any method of contraception? Yes No
Which number and sex compositions produced the highest level of satisfaction, the greatest intent for no more children, and the highest level of contraceptive use? A cursory examination of data in Table 4 shows that the odds of being satisfied (Panel 1), wanting no more children (Panel 2), and using contraception (Panel 3) rise with number of living children. Some women are still in the midst of the childbearing years and will have additional children. But few express satisfaction (intend no more children, or use contraception) until they have at least two, and especially three or four children.
If we examine satisfaction for those with a given number of children, then substantial sex preference is obvious. For those with two children, few with only two daughters are satisfied. If there are sons, then the odds of being satisfied are much higher. But most women want more than two children, which explains why satisfaction is much higher at subsequent parities. Also note that dissatisfaction can be expressed by the deficit of women with given sex/number compositions.

Women with "unsatisfactory" compositions would try to have an additional birth. For instance, women with only two children are 2.8 ([17 + 14]/ [2 + 9]) times more likely to have two sons and no daughters compared to two daughters and no sons. There should be roughly the same number of two-son and two-daughter families if there were no sex preference.7
7One would expect slightly more boys to be born because the sex ratio at birth (males/100 females) is generally found to be in the 102-106 range.

We fit a set of logistic regression models to these data. Coefficients are shown in Table 5. Model 1 includes only an effect of number of children. Model 2 includes three sex composition contrasts. At parity two,there is a contrast for those who have two sons versus two daughters, and a second contrast for those who have one son and one daughter versus two daughters. Relative to two daughters, note that the odds on being satisfied are 5.5 and 8.8 times greater if there are two sons and one son and one daughter

respectively. The third contrast is for those with three or more children. This contrast is between those who have at least two sons and those who do not. Specifically, for those with three or more children, having at least two sons raises the odds of being satisfied by a factor of 5.5.8
We repeated this analysis substituting "Do you intend another child?" for the "Are you satisfied question?" analyzed above. As can be seen from Panel 2 of Table 5, the model chosen
8The first and third sex composition contrast could be constrained to be equal in all three models. Such a constraint does not affect substantive interpretation, but produces a slightly more parsimonious model (as measured by degrees of freedom). We have not constrained these effects to be equal because our models selection strategy searched for preferred sex compositions at each parity. Thus, we prefer this parameterization because it is more consistent with our substantive understanding and model selection process.

to describe these data is identical to, and the substantive interpretation is the same as, the above.
Finally, the behavioral measure, currently using contraception, varies as these items do across number and sex composition of children. But the magnitude of sex composition effects on contraceptive use is much smaller than on responses discussed above. At parity three and above, those with two sons are 70 per cent more likely to be using contraception than those who have fewer than two sons. The failure to translate satisfaction and desire for no more children into contraceptive use is consistent with claims of substantial unmet need for contraception in this population (see Karki, 1988; Shrestha et al., 1988; Niraula, 1991).
We have formally compared our results with those of Karki (1988). We

find no evidence that the effects of sex composition vary between study populations (Table 6). In sum, the results above appear very robust and provide strong evidence of sex preference effects on satisfaction, intentions, and contraceptive behavior.
Substantively, these effects perfectly fit expectations gathered in less formal ways (visual inspection of the data, observation in the village, and conversations with residents). Thedesire for sons results from the important roles sons must fill. Having only one son is a risky strategy because this one son may not be able to fulfill all the family obligations or maydie.
PERVASIVENESS OF SEX AND
COMPOSITIONAL PREFERENCES
Without a question, caste and sizeof landholding provide the basis for key

differentiating statuses in Benighat. Caste andlandholding are also strongly and positively associated with one another. The key question we ask here: Are sex and compositional preferences pervasive in Benighat or are they stronger in some segments of the community?
The "land-security" hypothesisposits that ownership of land exerts a negative long-term effect on fertility because of income returns to equity and subsequent increase in old age security (Schutjer and Stokes, 1982; Stokesand Schutjer, 1984). It can be speculated that son preference would be greater among the landless than among those with more land. The reason is that land can provide old age support, thus reducing dependence on sons. Alternatively, lineage issues may be judged more important byhigh caste or landed

Vol. 42, No. 3-4

Son and Daughter Preferences

families. We find some evidence of the latter when we examine reasons for wanting a son by caste and by landholding (results not shown here). That is, women in landless families mention old age security more prominently than do those with more land; women with more land report continuity of lineage more frequently. Niraula (1995) has found that parental expectations of old age security is strengthened if they have both large landholdings and sons.
In short, the reasons for wanting sons are numerous. Some reasons are more salient for certain groups than for others, but these differences appear to offset one another. The desire for a daughter is also based on a broad number of factors and thus appears quite pervasive.
In order to test this hypothesis more formally, we replicated the analysis in Table 5 with a control for caste. We were unable to reject the hypothesis that sex composition effects estimated in Table 5 were the same across five caste groups. Likewise, we uncovered no evidence of differential effects across four landholding groups.9 Thus, we conclude that the sex composition preferences documented earlier are pervasive across caste and socioeconomic groups.
SEX PREFERENCE EFFECTS
ON FERTILITY
In the introduction we noted little consensus on the impact of sex preference on fertility. Just how pronatalist is sex preference? We have stressed that the answer to this question varies by
9 T h efour categories of ownership of landholding were: landless, small (up to 0.5 hectare), medium (0.51 to 1.5 hectare) and 1.51 hectare and above.

features of the social context. In Benighat, the potential effect is large, and the actual effect is substantial. The potential effect can be estimated by comparing desired number of boys plus girls with the mean family size required to achieve that sex composition. If we take the data in Table 1 and assume that women would stop childbearing when the number of children equaled to sum of boys plus number of girls desired, then the mean number born would be 3.3. If on the other hand we assumed that women would continue to bear children until they satisfied their desired sex composition, then they would bear approximately 4.8 children, nearly a 50 per cent increase.10 Clearly, strong sex composition desires (in the absence of sex selection technology) could increase fertility substantially. The desire for a minimum number of sons can have a pronatalist impact. And if a minimum number of daughters is required too, then an additional pronatalist force is possible. We are not suggesting that the actual effect of sex preference will be a 50 per cent increase in fertility. Rather, we see this figure as the maximum possible effect.
Past effects of sex preference can be seen in the parity distributions in Table 4. Actual effects on behavior were also
10The 3.3 value is simply the weighted mean of boys plus girls calculated from Table 1. The 4.8 figure is obtained by taking the weighted mean births required to obtain the population's desired sex composition (see Sheps, 1963,Table 1, or Bongaarts and Potter, 1983, Table 9.1). The 4.8 is an approximation because we have assumed the 4 + category equals 4 and because we have assumed that those having more than 4 births would have only 2 extra births to achieve the desired sex preference. These assumptions could affect the 4.8 estimate by only a modest amount because relatively few women reported a desired family size larger than 4 children.

evident in the proportion using contraception by parity distribution. We assess the pronatalist impact as substantial, although precise quantification of its impact is difficult and is not our goal here.
Throughout we have compared our results with those of Karki (1988) who studied Nepal hill populations using procedures similar to ours. By and large, empirical results from our studies are very similar (as shown formally in Table 6). Yet his conclusions deemphasize the import of sex preference compared to our conclusions. Specifically, Karki (1988, p. 177) notes that strong sex preference does not mean that fertility cannot be reduced. In fact, substantial numbers of women in Benighat and in Karki's study wanted no more children, yet were not using contraception. Clearly, family planning programs can play a role in reducing this "unmet need" for family planning. This point is a good one, but it does not suggest that sex preference is an unimportant factor. Secondly, Karki argues:
. . . the percent of couples who donot have asondecreases quite rapidly as the number of living children increases. Thus, only 10 percent of respondents with three children have no sons. It is this small group whose contraceptive and fertility behavior would be affected by the lack of ason.

cent of those with three children will not have this desired composition (see Bongaarts and Potter, 1983, Table 9.3).
In short Karki reaches the sameconclusion as does Arnold (1985, p. 287) in his examination of Korean data:
. . . it is likely that son preference will have some dampening effect on thefertility decline in Korea, but it will notbe a major obstacle to the achievement of Korea's fertility goals.
Arnold's study includes tables like Table 6. We have formally compared the Arnold results with those from Karki (1988) and from our study.11 We cannot reject the hypothesis that sex preference is equally strong in all three settings. So differing assessments of the import of sex preference lie in the investigators' interpretations not in the data.
A closer look at Arnold's evidence suggests a problem. Specifically, Arnold proposes a measure of sex preference consistent with the following hypothetical question: How much would overall levels of contraceptive use (for instance) change, if at each parity the behavior of those most satisfied with the sex composition of their children were shared by all at that parity? The Arnold measure is shown in Table 7 for Benighat, Karki's Hill Region data and Arnold's Korean data.12

This claim is misleading because it suggests that only small proportions of parents are dissatisfied with the sex composition of their families. If only one son is desired, then only 10 per cent of those with three children will be disappointed. But if, as we document, there is a widespread desire for two sons and one daughter, then 62 per

11Fit of selected models to data in Table 6 (not shown here but available upon request from the authors) shows that the additive effects of sons oncontraceptive use is identical in all the three settings. But the conditional effects of one son on contraceptive use increases contraceptive use in Arnold's Korean population and Karki's Nepali population, while two sons increases contraceptive use in both the Nepali settings and the Korean population has effects identical to additive effects.
12Details of calculations for results shown inTable 7 are available from the authors.

"Estimated contraceptive use is the level of contraceptive use in the absence of sex preference, calculated as suggested by Arnold, 1985. Calculations available from authors on request.

This measure attributes modest differences to sex preference. The measure's fundamental weakness is that it ignores the effects of sex preferences that operate through past fertility. For instance, and as we noted in the previous section, the Benighat data (Table 4) show well over twice as many two-son families as two-daughter families. The prevalence of these daughter-only and son-only families should be relatively equal. The fact that they are not demonstrates that sex preference acts not only on current contraceptive use but also has increased past fertility. In short, some of those couples using contraception at parity three would have used contraception at parity two if they had boys. This effect of sex preference on fertility (e.g., current parity) is substantial and is ignored in the Arnold procedure.
In sum, we find strong effects of sex preference in Benighat. Others who have presented similar empirical results have downplayed the import of sex preference. We question these interpretations.
CONCLUSIONS
Benighat women stressed old age security and continuity of lineage or religious reasons as prominent reasons for wanting sons. These reasons are

similar to those reported by Karki (1988) for another Nepali hill setting in 1979. They are also similar to answers given by women in other Asian countries. For example, in Korea and Taiwan, continuity of the family was frequently cited as a reason for wanting a son, while in the Philippines financial and economic support was the most common response (Bulatao, 1975; Wu, 1977; Lee and Kim, 1979). In both Korea and Taiwan, old age security was the second most important reason given for wanting a son.
In addition, the Benighat survey data and other data from the hill region (see Karki, 1988) show clearly that daughters are desired too. This finding is important, but less often stressed. The rationale for a degree of balance in the sex composition comes from the sharp sexual differentiation in Benighat. The roles played by boys and girls, and by men and women, are not functionally interchangeable. Moreover, in Benighat both sexes have important roles to play in their family of orientation. The roles of sons are more crucial and more long-term, but daughters also contribute and are valued. As a result, family size desires are formulated in terms of number of sons and number of daughters. Number of children desired comes from adding number of sons to number of daughters.
