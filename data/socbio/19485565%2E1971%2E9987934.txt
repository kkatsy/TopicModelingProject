Migration has a special interest for the human biologist and population geneticist because it is an important evolutionary force. Its action depends of course upon the size of the migrant population and the gene frequencies which obtain in the migrants as well as the host population (Cavalli-Sforza, 1963; Riser, 1965). Recognition of the importance of migration in shaping human populations has prompted geneticists to attempt to measure rates of population exchange and to relate these measurements to other biological parameters. Of special interest have been the causes and characteristics of the migratory phenomenon and the migrant individual (Elizaga, 1966). Central to genetic arguments, however, are the distances migrated, and the distribution of migrants over these distances. The commonest measure used by geneticists has been the interval between an individual's place of birth and place of marriage. The latter is presumed to be the place of birth of one's offspring, and the aim is to measure the distance as it relates to human generations (Cavalli-Sforza, 1963).
The present report is an effort to characterize in a preliminary manner the migrant

population of Valparaiso; it is preliminary because the findings to be set forth stem from research not especially designed for the analysis of migration. We present the distribution of immigrants, in this case spouses, to Valparaiso by sex, distance, and region of Chile. A relationship will be established between the immigrant spouses and the places of birth of their parents, and some characteristics of the individuals in relation to whether one, both, or none of his (her) parents were born in Valparaiso will be described.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The data stem from a survey of the city of Valparaiso in which the birthplaces of 827 individuals were determined together with the places of birth of their parents and four grandparents (Pinto-Cisternas and Figueroa, 1967). Since interest centered on movement toward Valparaiso and the places of origin of the migrants, the parents of each individual have been classified as nonmigrant or migrant depending upon whether they were or were not born in the city. To determine the distance of migration, the parents or spouses were divided into two groups, namely, (1) both

spouses born in the same geographic locality and (2) spouses born in different geographic places. Insofar as Group 1 is concerned, obviously either both spouses were migrants or neither were, but in Group 2 several alternatives arise. These are: (a) husband born in the city of Valparaiso (hence a nonmigrant) and wife born elsewhere (a migrant); (¿>) wife nonmigrant and husband migrant, and (c) both husband and wife migrants, but from different places.
To determine the migration distances the city of Valparaiso was viewed as the point of origin (more properly, destination) and from it the different geographic points were measured in terms of the kilometers of shortest road intervening between the place in question and Valparaiso. For a better analysis in view of the sample size, some grouping occurred; this involved different places within the province of Valparaiso, and of the provinces of Santiago and Aconcagua as well as in zones more than 200 kilometers north or south of Valparaiso. Foreign individuals were not subdivided but merely treated as a single group, i.e., foreign-born. In this form, ten

different zones were considered in the analysis.
Individuals were also divided on the basis of the number of their parents born in the city of Valparaiso, and each of the subsequent three groups were further subdivided on the basis of whether 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of the grandparents were born in the city. These various groups were then examined in terms of their ABO blood group distributions, socioeconomic standing, and the presence or absence of Carabelli's cusp (Pinto-Cisternas and Figueroa, 1968). Individuals with one or more grandparents of unknown place of birth were excluded from these considerations.
RESULTS
Tables 1 and 2 present the basic data on the birth places of the parents of 723 residents of Valparaiso. Examination of these data reveals Valparaiso to be the most common birthplace of the 1,446 parents and that the frequency with which parents come from other areas of Chile is approximately inversely related to the distance of that area from Valparaiso. This is clearest to the south; to the north there

is an excess of individuals from Zone 1, the farthest from Valparaiso. The reasons for this are to be found in the demographic characteristics of each zone and in the places of origin of the migrants. Thus, in Zone 1, most of the migrants are drawn from seaports and their migration to Valparaiso, Chile's major port, undoubtedly reflects occupational opportunities. Valparaiso is, of course, a major focus of migration in Chile as are Santiago, Concepción and Valdivia (Elizaga, 196S).
When these data are compared with those from the 1960 census (Dirección Estadística y Censo, 1964, Table 3), which revealed the number of individuals in Valparaiso in that year born in other provinces, we find relatively fewer individuals from the provinces of Santiago and Aconcagua and more from Tarapacá and Antofagasta. This difference reflects, we believe, the fact that the census data are from the entire province of Valparaiso whereas our data are from the city alone. It can also be seen that a slight disproportion exists in the number of men and women who migrate to Valparaiso, 52% and 48% respectively. This difference arises from the number of

men migrating from Zones 2, 4, 7, and abroad. Most studies have shown men and women to migrate in almost equal numbers (Elizaga, 1965).
Figure 1 abridges the findings of Tables 1 and 2 and shows the parent's birthplace distribution in the ten zones in which the sample was divided. Further, it reveals that most of Valparaiso's migrants are drawn from other urban areas rather than from nonurban localities, because in this figure the 76% of the geographical places where five or more individuals were born are cities with more than twenty thousand inhabitants. The only exception is Zone 8. All this agrees with the characteristics of the different zones according to the census data (see Table 3).
The general distribution of the individuals relating their parents' and grandparents' birthplaces to the three variables previously mentioned revealed great heterogeneity. For this reason, some chi-square analyses were made considering only the most contrasting groups, namely, the individuals with 2 parents and 4 grandparents born in the city of Valparaiso, and the individuals with no parents or grand-

parents born in the city. None of the chi-square figures were statistically significant. Only a few tendencies could be observed in relation to ABO blood groups and socioeconomic index.
In the first case there was an increase in the frequency of the O phenotype with an increasing number of migrant parents and grandparents. Individuals with 2 parents and 4 grandparents born in the city of Valparaiso had the following blood group frequencies: A, 40.38%; B, 9.16%; andO, 50.00%. For individuals with no parents or grandparents born in the city the frequencies were: A, 38.34%; B, 6.01%; and O, 56.39%.
In the second case, the data suggest a better socioeconomic status among those families which have migrated than among those which have not.Each home wassomewhat arbitrarily evaluated from a socioeconomic point of view, and five alternatives were recognized, namely, very good, good, acceptable, deficient, and bad (PintoCisternas y Figueroa, 1967). To these alternatives were given the successive integral values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, averaged over individual homes, and the means which emerge were:
individuals with 2 parents born in Valparaiso city,2.92
individuals with 1 parent born in Valparaiso city,2.66
individuals with 0 parents born in Valparaiso city,2.55
individuals with 2 parents and 4 grandparents born in Valparaiso city, 2.79

individuals with 0 parents and 0 grandparents born in Valparaiso city,2.59.
We can not presently account for this finding which is at variance with most other studies.
CONCLUSIONS
The most common birthplace of parents of residents of Valparaiso is the city itself. Migration to the city is approximately inverse to the distance of a given place from Valparaiso.
Relatively more of the migration from neighboring provinces is into the province of Valparaiso rather than into the city proper.
There is a slight disproportion in the frequency with which men and women migrate to Valparaiso.
Migrants come primarily from other urban areas.
There is somewhat higher frequency of blood group 0 among those individuals with the fewest Valparaiso-born parents and grandparents.
Inexplicably, the general socioeconomic status of the migrants is slightly better than that of the nonmigrants.
