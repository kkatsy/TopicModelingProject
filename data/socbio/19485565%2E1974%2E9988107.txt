Blood Group and Behavioral Differences Among Dizygotic Twins: A Failure to Replicate

Pakstis et al. (1972) reported positive correlations for 26 pairs of dizygotic twins between the number of blood groups on which the twins differed, their dissimilarity of appearance, and their behavioral dissimilarity (behavioral measures being several indices of activity level). The authors interpreted these correlations as reflecting different degrees of genetic dissimilarity among the twins. That is, those pairs with greater genetic differences also differed more physically and behaviorally. While three correlations out of the dozen or so reported reached a nominal 5 per cent significance level, the hazards of obtaining some large chance correlations when working with a number of variables in a small sample are well known. Consequently, it seemed advisable to try to confirm these findings using other data.
A sample of dizygotic twins was available from the Louisville Twin Study (Vandenberg et al., 1968; Vandenberg, 1969) for whom both blood group data and cognitive test scores had been obtained. Similarity of appearance was not assessed for this sample, which consisted of 85 white same-sex dizygotic pairs, 55 of which were female. The few Negro pairs in the original

sample were omitted, because the sample used by Pakstis et al. included only whites.
A blood group difference score was obtained for each pair by counting the number of blood group reactions out of the following set for which the pair differed: M, N, S, s, Pa, D, C, E, c, K, Le", Fya, JK% Ai, A2, B. Obtained scores ranged from 1 to 7, with a mean of 3.4 differences. These blood group difference scores were correlated with composite ability-difference scores representing verbal-educational, spatial, and perceptual-speed factors, plus a total ability composite. (For a description of the original tests, see Vandenberg, 1969, and for the scoring of the composites see Osborne and Suddick, 1971, or Loehlin, Vandenberg, and Osborne, 1973.)
The results of the present analysis are shown in Table 1. It is clear that there is little or no evidence here for a correlation between blood group dissimilarity and dissimilarity on the ability measures. Thus, these results do not support those obtained by Pakstis et al. (1972).
Why were we unable to replicate results? I t may, of course, be because of a difference in subjects or measures. The Pakstis study used Scarr's (1966) Boston sample

of pre-adolescent female twins; the present study used high-school-age twins of both sexes from Louisville, Kentucky, and vicinity. The blood group systems tested in the two studies differed somewhat. We counted differences by alleles while they counted differences by loci. However, it is difficult to believe that these discrepancies were of sufficient magnitude to make a large true effect in one study simply vanish in the other. There was indeed a major difference in the behavioral measures used: activity-level tests and ratings in the one study and cognitive ability measures in the other. Nonetheless, the logic of attributing a behavioral correlation to differing degrees of overlap in genotype would appear to be fully as cogent for ability as for temperament measures--perhaps even more so, given the somewhat more consistent and substantial evidence of heritability in the cognitive domain.
In retrospect, one might raise doubts about the ability of 8 or 10 blood group ·loci to provide a good estimate of genetic

resemblance over the whole set of chromosomes. One possible interpretation of the discrepancy in the results of the two studies would be that genes affecting activity level and physical appearance happen to be concentrated on the same chromosomes as the tested blood groups, whereas genes affecting cognitive abilities happen to be concentrated on other chromosomes. The linkage data offered by Pakstis et al. (1972) do not strongly support this interpretation; yet they do not clearly contradict it either.
At present, we can only recommend caution concerning the Pakstis et al. (1972) findings until such time as they may be successfully replicated. Our speculation is that positive correlations of the type described by those authors may indeed exist, but that they will generally be small in magnitude and require more genetic loci and larger samples for their dependable detection.
