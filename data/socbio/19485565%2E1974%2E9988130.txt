Although numerous reports have been published on the demographic structure of farming societies (Early, 1970; Erickson et al., 1970; Kunstadter, 1971, 1972; Halberstein and Crawford, 1972), incipient agriculturally based populations (Chagnon, 1967, 1968, 1972; Chagnon et al., 1970), and hunting and gathering societies (Birdsell, 1968; Yengoyan, 1968; Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1969; Laughlin, 1972; Turnbull, 1972), little is known about the demography of the itinerant populations of Europe. There is considerable information on the genetics of the Romany Gypsies of Europe (Verzar and Weszeczky, 1922; Cazal et al., 1952; Ely, 1961; Beckman and Takman, 1965; Nicoli and Sermet, 1965; Avcin, 1969; Galikova et al., 1969; Rex-Kiss and Szabo, 1971; and Clark, 1973). However, most of these studies include little information on the fertility, mortality, and migration patterns of the itinerant populations. A recent article by Avcin (1969) presents data on the reproductive histories and consanguinity of a sample of Gypsies from Slovenia.
This paper focuses upon an itinerant population in Ireland, known as the Tin-

kers (also called Travellers or Travelling People). Some demographic data were collected by the Irish Police (Garda) in 1960 and 1961 in order to develop strategies for integrating Tinkers into settled Irish society. The results of these censuses were published in the Report of the Commission on Itinerancy (Government of Ireland, 1963) and are a basic demographic source in this report. An additional census taken by the Department of Local Government in 1971 and a questionnaire sent to local authorities in 1972 yielded more data. To date, no other genetic studies have been performed on the Irish Tinkers and little information has been available on gene frequency distributions in Ireland. Most genetic studies of Irish populations focus upon the gene frequencies of one or two loci (Hart, 1944; Hooper, 1947; Dawson, 1952, 1958, 1964; Hackett, 1958; Hackett and Folan, 1958; Lundman, 1962; Casey et al., 1969; Kopec, 1970). More extensive surveys of blood group frequencies have been conducted by Palsson et al., (1970), Sunderland et al. (1973), and Wai ter and Palsson (19 73).
The primary purpose of this paper is:
(1) to describe the demographic structure

of the Irish Tinker population, and (2) to discuss the genetic and evolutionary implications of these population parameters.
THE POPULATION
Like the Romany Gypsy, Tinkers were traditionally wanderers. They traveled regular circuits, usually within the confines of one or two counties, in patrilineally related groups of two to four families. Tinsmithing was their major occupation, but they also traded workhorses and asses, swept chimneys, peddled small wares, and performed various odd jobs, all in rural areas. They originally traveled on foot, then in horse-drawn carts, and more recently in brightly painted barrel-top wagons. They camped on the roadside, usually on the outskirts of a town, in tents and wagons. Viewed with fear and suspicion, they were unwelcome in the settled community and were only permitted to remain in an area until their work was done, rarely more than two weeks. This forced social isolation contributed greatly to their endogamy.
In the last two decades, the Tinkers' traditional way of life in rural areas has been disrupted. Modernization in Ireland has led to the introduction of new goods and machinery which have made the Tinkers' traditional trades obsolete. Plastic containers and enamelware, for example, have eliminated the demand for the Tinkers' handmade tinware. Farm mechanization has replaced the need for workhorses. Improved roads, the private automobile, and the expansion of bus service have led to the demise of peddling, since farm women are no longer isolated and are now able to travel to towns to shop.
With the decline in their traditional occupations, Tinker men have turned primarily to collecting scrap metal and the women to begging--a direct outgrowth of peddling but without the pretense of

offering something for sale. These new subsistence patterns are most successfully pursued in the towns and cities, where scrap metal and other castoffs are more plentiful and begging is easier. Simply because housing is concentrated in urban areas, female beggars are able to go to many more homes each day. By the late 1960's, a substantial majority of Ireland's Tinker population had migrated from the countryside into population centers. By 1971, 248 of Ireland's 1,302 Tinker families were living on the outskirts of Dublin alone. In response to the large number of Tinkers moving into urban areas, the Itinerant Settlement Movement began in 1965 to help settle Tinkers. The movement, which originated in Dublin but soon spread nationwide, has used government financing to construct approximately seventy serviced campsites for Tinker families.
Today, approximately 300 families are living on government sites. Some are permanently settled while others remain only a few months before traveling on to a new location. An additional ISO families have been housed within the settled community. The remaining 800 families are still living on the roadside. Some are highly mobile (e.g., teams of four to five families who lay asphalt), while others change camp only a few times each year. Table 1 shows the per cent of Tinkers inhabiting different types of accommodations in 1960 and 1972.
The Tinker community has thus far survived these dramatic changes. Tinkers remain a social isolate having little contact with members of the settled Irish community. Furthermore, they still retain a distinct argot, called Gammin or Cant which is unintelligible to the settled Irish population.
MacMahon (1971) has summarized some of the popular theories of the ethno-

genesis of the Irish Tinkers: (1) The Tinkers are descendants of the outcasts who chose to live beyond "the circle of the Brehon Laws," the ancient body of common law of the prehistoric Irish island. (2) The Tinkers are descendants of native chieftains and their families who, dispossessed in the successive English plantations of Ireland, assumed an itinerant life style. MacMahon claims that the Tinkers of today bear the names of some of the noblest Irish clans and are associated with the territories inhabited by their chieftain ancestors. (3) The Tinkers are a hybrid population resulting from admixture between the Irish and the Romany Gypsies. (4) The Tinkers are displaced peasants and laborers driven from their lands and occupations by economic upheavals, famine, and conflict. Cromwell's invasion and conquest of Ireland (1649-50), followed by the Act of Settlement in 1652, uprooted much of the native Irish population, forcing them into an itinerant existence. These new itinerants swelled the ranks of those artisans and tinsmiths who traditionally traveled the roads of Ireland. The blood group frequency data and the genetic distances between the Tinkers, sedentary Irish, and Romany Gypsies support the latter hypothesis (Crawford, 1974).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data were collected both from recently settled Tinkers and from Travellers on the roads. Three government settlements on the outskirts of Dublin--Labre Park, Finglas, and Rathfarnam--were the primary sites of investigation. The annual turnover in these settlements is approximately 50 per cent, according to one government official, so that there is a constant influx of Travellers, some permanently assuming a sedentary life while others return to the road. Out of the 238 Tinkers interviewed and tested, 126 were encountered on the roads in the counties Dublin, Wicklow, and Wexford. The remaining 56 per cent of the sample came from the three government settlements listed above.
Demographic and genealogical information were collected by using a demographic proforma specifically designed for the'Irish itinerants. The data were obtained during two periods of time, during the summer of 1970 and during 1971-72. Additional data were also collected by one of us who spent one year in the field (1971-72). The demographic data were analyzed and tested for consistency through comparison of responses from related individuals on family size, mortality, place of origin, and age of spouse. If contradictory responses from relatives could not be resolved, the interview was deleted from the sample.
RESULTS
The size of the Tinker population in Ireland is increasing according to the government censuses. In 1960,the population of 6,591 itinerants was divided into 1,198 families spread over all of Ireland's 26 counties. The greatest concentrations of Tinkers were in Galway, Cork, and Mayo, in predominantly rural areas. The 1971 census registered an increase in population size with a total of 7,778 Tinkers, divided into 1,302 families. The greatest

concentrations of Tinkers were in the urban areas of Dublin, Limerick, and Galway, reflecting the massive rural-urban migration which had taken place since the previous census.
The Tinker population is young, with 52 per cent of the 1960 and S3 per cent

due to the greater likelihood that males will assume the itinerant way of life. I t is estimated that about 10 per cent of the parents of today's Traveller families in Ireland had left behind them a settled way of life (Government of Ireland, 1963). The disproportionate number of males may also reflect the extreme youthfulness of the Tinker population.

of the 1961 population under IS years of age (see Table 2). This high proportion of children in the population contrasts markedly with the age structure of the Irish population, in which only 31.8 per cent of the males and 30.8 per cent of the females were under IS years of age during the 1968 census. The disparity in the age structure of the Irish and the Tinker populations reflects the high fertility of the Tinkers.
The Irish Tinker population exhibits a slight preponderance of males over females. The tertiary sex ratio, the number of males per 100 females in the total population, was 106.16 for 1960 and 106.46 for 1961.
There is some geographical variation in the relative number of males and females in the Tinker population. Kilkenny County exhibits the greatest numerical disparity, with a sex ratio of 153.26. In contrast, County Kildare has more Tinker females than males, with a sex ratio of 87.71. The disproportionate number of males to females among the Irish Tinkers may be

This figure is roughly consistent with the traditional traveling patterns described in Table 4, in which 49.66 per cent of the Tinker community followed circuits within one county and an additional 23.32 per cent within one province. Although the latter group traveled a circuit covering several counties within a province, they generally identified themselves with one county and usually wintered there. The traditional pattern of choosing mates from the same county has not been greatly upset by recent urbanization. Although some

of the lineages which formerly exchanged mates are now dispersed, most urban Tinkers continue to arrange marriages with families from their home county and increasingly from within their own lineage.
Of the 190 marriages where family names were recorded, 24 or 12.63 per cent were isonymous (marriage of two individuals who have the same family name). This frequency of isonymy among the Tinkers is comparable to the frequency reported in two isolated Italian Alpine communities, Bellino with 13.82 per cent isonymy in 1851-70, and Casteldelfino with 11.59 per cent isonymy for marriages occurring in 1866-77 (Lasker et al., 1972). Lower isonymy rates were detected in contemporary Mexican Indian farming communities, with 2.16 per cent of the marriages being isonymous in San Pablo, Tlaxcala, and 1.3 per cent in the City of Tlaxcala (Halberstein, 1972).
Unfortunately, the exact levels of inbreeding cannot be computed since a number of the genealogies are incomplete. Numerous instances of first- and secondcousin marriages were identified in several of the more complete genealogies. Masterson's (1970) study of the frequency of consanguineous marriages between Catholics in all of Ireland from 1958 to 1968 revealed that only 1 in 625 marriages were contracted between first cousins. However, five first-cousin marriages were observed in the Rathfaram settlement in 1971-72. These data support Masterson's contention that the itinerants may contribute substantially to the1 published consanguinity figures.
AGE OF MARRIAGE
It appears that the Tinkers are presently marrying at a younger age than during the previous generation. The combined mean age of marriage of the Tinkers interviewed is 18.17 years for females and

21.61 years for males. However, a subdivision of the sample into two generations (those born prior to 1930 and those born after 1930) suggests that members of the present generation marry at an average of 2 years younger than during the previous generation (see Table 5).

The earlier age of marriage has been attributed to the parents' desire to marry off their daughters as close to puberty as possible in order to protect their virginity and prevent an illegitimate pregnancy (Gmelch, 1973). Parents are careful to protect girls from having premarital affairs because the loss of virginity would ruin a girl's reputation and make it very difficult to find her a suitable marriage partner. An illegitimate child would disgrace the family and most likely result in the unwed mother being ostracized from the group.
Traditionally, the activities of single girls were closely supervised. Girls were never permitted to be alone in the company of boys their age. In the traditional rural setting, close supervision was possible because camps were small and isolated from nearby villages as well as from other Tinkers. If parents discovered or suspected that their daughter was secretly seeing a boy in camp, they simply left the group.
Today, however, camps tend to be large and much less isolated. In these camps, particularly in urban areas, there are many

326

opportunities for undetected meetings between the sexes. Also, most teenage girls are absent from the camp and therefore beyond their parents' supervision several hours each day while begging. Because Tinkers are more sedentary today, it is not so easy for parents to leave camp every time that they suspect that their daughter is seeing a boy. Powerless to prevent illicit courtship and thus to protect their daughter's reputation, Tinker parents today are arranging marriages ("matches") for their daughters at an earlier age.
FERTILITY
The Tinkers exhibit a high rate of achieved reproduction; the mean number of children per prolific woman 40 years of age and older is 10.43, with a variance of 22.39 (see Table 6). The mean fertility

rate of the Tinkers is one of the highest recorded in contemporary human populations, surpassed only by the highly prolific Hutterites. The mean number of children per prolific married woman in the population is 7.94 with a variance of 2.68. The Report of the Comrhission on Itin-

erancy (Government of Ireland, 1963) estimates an average of 6-7 children per family of Tinkers. The disparity between the mean derived from interviews and the lower government census results may be the result of the slight fertility increase noted earlier in the paper.
This high fertility of the Tinkers can be explained in part by the long reproductive careers of the females who, on the average, are married at 18 years of age and continue reproducing until age 40 or 45. Upon the completion of its reproductive activity, the average Tinker family has produced at least 13 live births, and one still birth. Three of their children will die during the first IS years of life. Given a reproductive span of 22 to 27 years, Tinker women conceive more frequently than once every two years.
These frequent pregnancies are a nutritional drain on the female. The number of calories estimated to be necessary to sustain a single pregnancy is 80,000 (FAO, 1957). The caloric cost of 14 pregnancies carried to term is 1,120,000 calories over and above the required intake of 2,200 calories per day. More important are the additional protein requirements of a lactating female, who would need an intake of 98 grams of protein daily. If a woman breastfeeds each child for nine months, the additional protein requirement is 26,460 grams (White et al., 1964). Thus, an Irish Tinker female with 14 pregnancies would require an additional intake of 1,120,000 grams of protein. Since the diet of the Tinkers is marginal at best, the additional protein needs would place a great deal of stress on the organism.
Undoubtedly, these fertility and reproductive wastage rates are gross underestimates of the actual rates of neonatal mortality, stillbirths, and spontaneous abortions, since these figures were collected through the use of a demographic pro-

forma. Although these questionnaires have built-in tests for internal consistency and are cross-checked by interviewing close relatives, these results must be considered preliminary. v
There appears to be a significant difference in the achieved reproduction rates of the recently settled Tinkers and those Tinkers still living on the roadside. The mean number of children in the three government settlements is 9.73, in comparison to 5.70 children among the Tinkers who have maintained a more mobile life style. This fertility difference is probably due to the earlier age of marriage and to a reduction in the infant mortality rates. The settled Tinkers have better access to med-

vealed that 32.00 per cent of all children born fail to reach IS years of age. For a Western European population, this death rate is exceptionally high; however, in a Mexican agricultural community, Cuanalan, more than 50 per cent of the children born fail to reach IS years of age.
A population such as the Irish Tinkers, with high neonatal mortality and high fertility has the potential for rapid evolutionary change. Crow (1958, 1966) proposed an index for the opportunity of natural selection based upon the mortality and fertility structure of the population. In comparison with agricultural and urban societies, Crow's index is of medium intensity among the Irish Tinkers. In Table 7,

MORTALITY
A more complete treatment of mortality and morbidity, of the Irish Tinkers will be presented in a subsequent paper. The Travellers experience high mortality and morbidity during the first year of life and until IS years of age. The Report of the Commission on Itinerancy (Government of Ireland, 1963) claims that 12.50 per cent of 13,033 children born failed to reach two years of age. Reconstruction of reproductive wastage and infant and child mortality based on questionnaires re-

the total indices and the fertility and mortality components of the Tinkers are compared to published values for other societies of various economic and cultural types. The demographic attributes of the Irish Tinkers suggest that if disease favored a specific genotype, selection would proceed at an intermediate level of intensity.

frequencies of the Irish Tinkers are similar to those of the Kilkenny and Irish composite. Some significant gene frequency differences between the Tinkers and the Irish are also evident. At the Rhesus blood group locus, the cDE chromosomal segment has an exceptionally high incidence among the Tinkers--more than twice the frequency found in the Kilkenny population. The Tinkers also exhibit anomalous frequencies of the pa allele at the add

lations. It provides a measure of divergence based on differences in frequencies over any number of loci (Sanghvi, 1953). Computation of distance was based upon 14 alleles and chromosomal segments from four genetic systems, ABO, Rh, MN, and Haptoglobin. Although allelic frequencies for IS systems were available for the Irish Tinkers and Kilkenny, fewer systems are available for other populations, and the greater the number of populations used in the analysis, the fewer the available allelic frequencies. Table 10 summarizes the computed genetic distances between ten populations or geographical groups. The allelic frequencies representing England and Iceland were compiled from Mourant (1954) and Giblett (1969); Hungarian Gypsy, Hungarian, and Punjab frequencies were obtained from Rex-Kiss et al. (1973). Ireland is represented by the Palsson et al. (1970) study.
These genetic-distance measures suggest that the Tinkers are closest genetically to the Irish populations. What is surprising is that the Hungarians appear to be closer genetically to the Tinkers than to the English. The Tinkers differ most from the Icelandic sample, which is surprising considering the known historical relationship between Iceland and Ireland. This difference can in part be explained on the basis of the Tinkers' social isolation. While the

Tinkers are the closest genetically to the surrounding Irish populations, they appear to have diverged at a number of loci.
CONCLUSIONS
This study reveals that the Irish Tinkers constitute a social isolate, but the population does not appear to have diverged significantly in all of the genetic systems. Significant differences between the Irish Tinkers and the sedentary populations exist at certain loci, but these differences are often obscured by the problems associated with sampling.
Demographically, the Tinkers appear to be in a state of transition resulting from

the governmental attempts at settling them. Judging from the recent changes in the age of marriage and in the preliminary fertility data, it is likely that the Irish Tinkers will continue to show an increase in achieved reproduction. With the possible settlement of these traveling people, it is probable that this social isolate will continue to break down and may eventually lose its genetic and cultural distinctiveness.
