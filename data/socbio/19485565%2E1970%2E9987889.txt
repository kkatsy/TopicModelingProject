Reed (19696) has reviewed studies which attempt to estimate the amount (M) of Caucasian gene flow to American Negro populations. These studies provide information about the genetic heterogeneity among various populations, and M values for different loci may indicate genes which have been subject to the action of natural selection during the past 250 to 350 years (Hertzog and Johnston, 1968; Reed, 19695, 1970; Workman, 1968, 1970; Workman et al., 1963). The basic argument for detection of selection by comparison of M values for different loci is that although selection pressures may be too weak to be detected with data covering only two generations, directional changes in gene frequencies accumulated over 10 generations or so should be detectable.
Both Reed and Workman as well as Hertzog and Johnston have discussed the problems inherent in the genetic data and in the statistics of estimation. Their discussions should be consulted for details and criticisms (see References at end of article). I will summarize some of the results in order

to indicate the complexity of population structure which one attempts to describe by the single statistic,
M = (qn - qa)/(,q, - qa) ,
where qa represents the frequency of a given gene in the African ancestral population, qc is the frequency in the ancestral Caucasian population, and qn is the frequency in a present-day American Negro population. Thus, M is a measure of total Caucasian admixture for a given gene in a specified hybrid population of biracial origin. Most studies are concerned primarily with static and historical aspects of hybridization (with the exception of studies attempting to detect the operation of natural selection); few admixture studies emphasize the rate of racial intermixture and the establishment of dynamic equilibria (see, for example, Glass and Li, 1953; Roberts, 1955; Roberts and Hiorns, 1962).
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT GENETIC STRUCTURE OF HYBRID POPULATIONS
One of the basic assumptions inherent in any attempt to describe the genetic structure of a hybrid population as the result solely of intermixture or of both intermix-

ture and selection is that the ethnic compositions of the ancestral populations are known. Basically, the equation for M given above describes the situation wherein only two genetically different populations have contributed to the formation of the hybrid population, and gene flow is in one direction only. In the present case it is assumed that gene flow has been unidirectional from Caucasian to American Negro populations.
With regard to the probability of triracial origin of United States Negro populations, Herskovits (1930), on the basis of limited information reported in genealogical questionnaires, concluded that a significant proportion of American Negroes had some American Indian ancestry. However, Glass (1955) was unable to demonstrate any significant proportion of American Indian admixture in blood group samples composed predominantly (or exclusively) of urban Negroes. As Glass pointed out, this is not surprising under the assumptions of an originally small contribution of Indian genes and no differential fitness in favor of IndianNegro matings and their descendants. Herskovits (1930, p. 41) recognized that "crossing with the Indians is a matter of some generations ago, and today is an exceptional occurrence." Pollitzer (1958) commented that some physical and verbal evidence for Indian admixture exists in Negro populations surveyed in the sea-island area of South Carolina and Georgia. Furthermore, he noted that serological studies of tribes most likely to have been involved in intermixture with Negroes were not available in the 1950's. In subsequent work, Pollitzer (1964) has described a tri-racial isolate in North Carolina. This group, and probably others of this kind, consider themselves Indian rather than Negro, although estimation of the amount of admixture from the putative contributing populations for this group indicates more Caucasian and Negro ancestry than Indian. Thus, not only would these isolated populations not be considered "Ne-

gro" for most studies, but they are also rare today and quickly dissolving.
Undoubtedly there was gene flow from Indians as well as Caucasians to some American Negro groups. The fact that the American Indian component is not detectable in any given Negro sample is partly a reflection of true historical differences in the genetic composition of various hybrid populations, of difficulties in detection of a small amount of gene flow, and of difficulties defining and obtaining samples from the correct ancestral components. Furthermore, genetic samples of Caucasians, Indians, and Negroes are rarely, if ever, mutually exclusive with regard to the allelic states at any given locus. Finally, it must be pointed out that almost all of the studies of North American Negro populations tacitly assume the absence of gene flow from American Indians.
Given the model of bi-racial origin of American Negro populations, Pollitzer (1958) and Reed (19695) have used information on the distribution of slaves from the major slave-trading areas to attempt a reconstruction of the ethnic composition of the African ancestral component. Coupled with the assumption that gene frequencies in present-day African populations in the slaving areas have not changed, mean gene frequencies can be obtained weighted by the proportionate contribution to the slave trade. In order to obtain estimates of the gene frequencies in the ancestral Caucasian component, it must also be assumed that these frequencies are the same as in presentday descendants. It has been pointed out to me by Pollitzer (personal communication) that knowledge about the ethnic composition of slaves imported to the United States is applicable with confidence only to Negro populations with a long history of residence in the Charleston, South Carolina, area. In other words, we know little about the actual ethnic composition of the African component for Negro groups which have had a long

history of residence in other areas of the United States.
An additional set of assumptions must be met which requires that the samples be drawn from the correct present-day descendants of ancestral Caucasian and African populations, and from the Negro population under study; and that these samples be unbiased and with as small standard errors of gene frequencies as possible. Both Glass (1955) and Reed (196%) have excluded certain series of American Negro blood-group samples on the basis that they were biased by attempts of the investigators to preferentially include individuals of darker skin color and/or exclude individuals with physical traits indicative of white admixture (for examples, see Table 1). Pollitzer (1958) detected an association between some morphological traits indicative of more or less negroidness and the frequency of the genes for hemoglobins S and C, the Duffy blood

groups, and the B allele of the ABO blood group system when he divided the Charleston Negro sample (composed predominantly of Gullah Negroes) into two moieties according to morphological measures. Since even unlinked genes can be correlated in hybrid populations which have not reached equilibrium for gametic phase, and since the approach to gametic phase equilibrium-- although rapid under most conditions, in the absence of selection--is retarded by assortative mating within the population (see Crow and Felsenstein, 1968), it is not entirely unexpected that some Negro isolates have yet to reach equilibrium for all gametic combinations.
There is evidence that a complex pattern of assortative mating has been practiced in the past within some urban, nonsouthern American Negro populations. From data on the skin color of 174 pairs of husbands and wives from the Harlem district of New York

City investigated in 1925-26, Herskovits (1926, 1930) concluded that the darkest women tend to marry men of their own or lighter color while the lighter women marry men decidedly darker than themselves. However, the overall association which I computed by the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient was r, -- 0.43 (corrected for tied ranks). This positive association for skin color among Harlem couples is significant at the 0.001 level (for a two-tailed test). Herskovits also noted positive correlations for lip thickness (r = 0.22) and width of nose (r = 0.13) among these couples. However, his method used in calculating these latter two correlations may not be entirely valid. Pollitzer (1958) suggests that mate selection in favor of those Negroes with indications of Caucasian admixture may have operated among Negroes in close association with a dominant white society in large numbers, whereas among Negroes long isolated in the coastal counties of lower South Carolina, and of distinctly more negroid appearance, mate selection was against those showing signs of Caucasian admixture. This latter process may have been strong enough to impede Caucasian gene flow to or to lead to differential migration of hybrids from Negro isolates of the coastal area.
As Reed (1970) has reiterated in his reply to comments by Workman (1970), both ethnically correct as well as statistically accurate gene frequencies are needed for proper estimation of the amount of genetic admixture in any defined population. Glass and Li (1953) first pointed out that one should choose genes which exhibit the maximum divergence in frequency between the two putative ancestral populations in order to reduce the standard error of the estimate M. Furthermore, since the exact ethnic composition of the African component cannot be known, the chosen gene should be uniformly distributed over the entire slave-trade area. Ideally, one would like to have a gene, selectively neutral, which can be shown to be

absent or rare in the ancestral African populations which contributed slaves to the New World, but common in Caucasians. The Gm alleles Gm1, Gm1'*, and Gm6 may be of this type (Reed, 1969a). An even stronger case has been made for the Fya gene of the Duffy blood group system (Reed, 1969J). Workman (1968, 1970) has argued that it is mainly the consistency of the magnitude of M values among different Negro samples which indicates those genes which may have been subject to stronger or weaker selection. Furthermore, there is corroboration from other lines of evidence to suggest that some of the genes detected by this method are under the action of natural selection.
It is curious, however, that although effort and discussion have been devoted to obtaining reliable African and American Negro gene frequencies little has been said about the accuracy of gene frequencies used in representing the ancestral Caucasian component. Surely most of the gene flow must have occurred early in the history of rural Negro populations. Nevertheless, inspection of early censuses of the United States by state and by country of origin suggests a large degree of variation in European origin of nineteenth-century residents of the United States. To what extent this heterogeneity extended further into the past and to what extent it represents effective genetic heterogeneity with respect to admixture with African slaves and American Negroes probably cannot be determined (see Roberts, 1955).
It is necessary to consider, then, that the genetic heterogeneity as revealed by estimates of gene flow among various United States Negro populations represents different histories of amounts of admixture with a Caucasian gene pool as well as the operation of other evolutionary factors which have modified the genetic composition of the hybrid populations. With regard to the last point, one must recognize the possibility of founder effects occasioned by the extreme

mortality suffered by slaves prior to their arrival in the United States and by their segregation into more or less isolated populations on large plantations in the South.
GENETIC HETEROGENEITY AMONG HYBRID POPULATIONS
Estimates of the total amount of Caucasian admixture in different American Negro samples reviewed by Reed (1969J) are not strictly comparable with regard to sample size, chosen gene, and estimated ancestral gene frequencies. Nevertheless, two patterns of consistency emerge which have biological significance. First of all, some authors have suggested that higher than average M values, of the order of 0.34 to 0.70, indicate the operation of natural selection on the gene in question. Thus, Workman (1968; Workman et al., 1963) was able to conclude that there is evidence for selection acting against the T, TfD1, Hb^, Hbc, Hp1, and G6-PD deficiency genes and the Ai allele (of the ABO system) in United States Negro populations. In addition, M values indicate that selection has acted in favor of the A2 allele of the ABO blood groups and against the Gc*gene in American Negro groups, and that it is the haptoglobin subtype Hp1F which is under strong selective pressures. Hertzog and Johnston (1968) using a similar approach conclude that there is evidence for strong selection favoring the Rh-negative gene, r, which is more than enough to offset the effects of incompatibility selection.
The second pattern, which is most obvious among the series of genes other than those just mentioned, is the smaller average M values (0.04 to 0.12) for various southern samples as compared to higher M values (0.13 to 0.31) for nonsouthern, urban samples. Estimates of the maximum M derived from the frequency of the Fya gene in three nonsouthern samples, presumably unbiased, yield values in the range of 0.189-0.260; while the predominantly Gullah Negro sample from Charleston, South Carolina, pro-

vided M = 0.037 and another, less isolated, group sampled from this area yielded M = 0.106 (Table 1). The same Caucasian frequency of the Fya gene--that of Oakland Whites provided by Reed (1968) and equal to 0.4286--was used in all of these estimates. Furthermore, since the ancestral African gene frequency was assumed to be zero, the formula for M reduces to M -- qn/qc
The low estimates of Caucasian admixture for both series from the Charleston, South Carolina, area accord well with comparisons based on anthropometric data. Furthermore, the Gullah isolate also evinces a linguistic distinctiveness akin to languages of West Africa. Pollitzer (1958) has also noted the survival of magic and other practices from West Africa among the coastal Negroes. The predominantly Gullah sample from Charleston is not only closer biologically to African populations but is also qualitatively different from other American Negro samples from outside of the Charleston area. Pollitzer concludes that differences in ancestral components as well as in the degree of Caucasian admixture are responsible for the divergence of Charleston from other American Negroes. It is also probable that genetic drift has played a role in contributing to the variation of gene frequencies among various Negro populations in the Charleston area (Pollitzer et al., 1964).
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO GENETIC VARIATION
Differences in the amount of Caucasian admixture must be the major factor responsible for the regional variation in M values demonstrated for United States Negroes. However, it was also suggested that various American Negro populations may well have differed in the genetic composition of the ancestral African and Caucasian components. For example, with respect to African mean gene frequencies for alleles of the ABO blood group system which is polymorphic in
