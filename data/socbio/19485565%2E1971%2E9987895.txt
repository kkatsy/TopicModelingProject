Congenital Hip Disease: Implications for Genetic Counseling

Although a genetic component has been established for congenital hip disease, symbolized by CHD, it is clear that certain nongenetic factors are of etiologic importance (Record and Edwards, 1958; Carter and Wilkinson, 1964; Rabin et al., 1965; Woolf, Koehn, and Coleman, 1968). Etiologic heterogeneity implies that some cases are more genetically determined than others.
An investigation was designed to compare the frequency of CHD in the close relatives of different types of propositi with CHD in order to test for etiologic heterogeneity and to gain more insight into the genetics of CHD. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of this study.
The data were obtained from a study carried out in Utah (Woolf et al., 1968) using propositi obtained from medical records made available by physicians in Salt Lake City, Utah. Each propositus had undergone therapeutic treatment for hip dysplasia or dislocation (or both). Field workers visited the homes of 290 propositi belonging to different sibships and obtained information of epidemiologic interest. The frequency of CHD was obtained in the following relatives of the propositi: sibs, parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and first cousins. The 290 propositi are classified in Table 1 as to sex,

type of disorder (unilateral or bilateral), and whether the birth was breech or nonbreech.
FREQUENCY OF C H D IN RELATIVES OF THE PROPOSITI
The frequencies of CHD in the various relatives of the propositi are given in Table 2. It has been suggested (Carter and Wilkinson, 1964; Rabin et al., 1965; Woolf et al., 1968) that a major genetic component consists of polygenes resulting in quasi-continuous variation. For this type of inheritance, the disorder occurs, or has an increased probability of occurring, if the number of genes is above a threshold. The coefficient of relationship (r) between propositi and parents, propositi and sibs, and propositi and children, is in each case onehalf. When a polygenic mode of inheritance is present, the frequency of the disorder should be similar in parents, sibs, and children of the propositi. No data are available in the literature on the frequency of CHD in the children of propositi since all major studies have used children as propositi.
The data of the present study for sibs and parents would, by themselves, tend to negate a polygenic mode of inheritance. A higher frequency of CHD occurred in the sibs (4.12%, n = 897) than parents (1.55%,

n = 580) of the propositi. This difference may be largely ascribed to under-reporting for members of previous generations when means of detection were less available. Many cases of dysplasia go undetected; the disorder progresses to normal without therapy. I t would be expected that any disparity between real and reported frequency values would be more marked for members of earlier generations.
A criterion for polygenic inheritance is a marked decrease in the frequency of affected individuals as one proceeds from first-degree to second-degree to third-degree relatives. The observed frequency values for first-degree relatives (sibs and parents), second-degree relatives (grandparents, aunts, and uncles) and third-degree relatives (first cousins) are 3.11%, 0.52% and 0.70%, respectively. The drop anticipated for polygenic inheritance is not realized.
Although this may be explained by under-reporting for parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles, it may also reflect etiologic heterogeneity for CHD. Carter and Wilkinson (1964) have proposed that at least two different genetic components exist for CHD, one affecting the depth of the joint socket and the other causing generalized ligamentous laxity. They propose that

the former is probably polygenic, while the latter is probably due to a dominant gene. When dominant inheritance is present, the frequency of affected individuals decreases by one-half as one proceeds from first-degree to second-degree to third-degree relatives.
The observed data would be compatible with dominant inheritance, assuming reduced penetrance, only if gross underreporting occurred for parents and seconddegree relatives. The frequency data in the various groups of relatives do not by themselves lead to any firm conclusion concerning the nature of the genetic component for CHD; it is plausible that polygenic and dominant types occur.
EFFECT OF FAMILY HISTORY ON THE RISK OF C H D
A feature of polygenic inheritance, as contrasted with recessive inheritance, is the influence of a family history of the trait on the risk of the trait in the sibs of the propositi. If the parents are normal, the expected frequency of an autosomal recessive trait in the sibs of the propositi is 25% regardless of the presence or absence of the trait in any other relative. Assuming polygenic inheritance and complete heritability, propositi will vary as to the number of genes they possess above the threshold number; their normal parents will vary as to the number of genes they possess below the threshold number. The higher the number of genes possessed by the parents, the higher the probability that their child will have the trait. Propositi with affected close relatives likely have more of the genes than propositi with no affected relatives. Furthermore, the higher the number of genes possessed by the propositi, the higher the probability they will have an affected sib.
A positive family history of CHD would also increase the frequency of CHD in the sibs of the propositi if the disorder was determined in some cases by a dominant gene

showing reduced penetrance and in other cases by exogenous factors. A positive family history of CHD would tend to distinguish propositi with the dominant gene from the exogenous types; the responsible gene would then be expected to occur in one-half of their sibs.
The overall data suggest that a familyhistory effect does exist for CHD (see Table 3). The frequency of affected sibs in the absence of a family history is 3.28% (n = 579); it is increased to 5.66% (n = 318) if there is a positive family history of CHD. The frequency of affected sibs is 5.84% (n = 291) if the parents were reported to be normal but some other relative had the disorder. The difference in frequency values in the sibs of the male propositi with and without a family history of CHD is statistically significant in support of the existence of a family-history effect (11.54% [« = 52] vs. 2.56% [n = 117]). Although possessing the sign specified by the family-history effect, the difference in the frequency of CHD in the sibs of the two types of female propositi is not significant (4.51% [n = 266] vs. 3.46% [n = 462]).
The data for the male propositi, but not those for the female propositi, support the concept that an affected sib increases the frequency of CHD in the other relatives (see Table 3). The frequency of CHD in the other relatives (parents, second- and thirddegree relatives) of the propositi is 2.41% (n = 166) when a sib is affected; it is decreased to 0.82% in these relatives of the male propositi when a sib is not affected. This difference is statistically significant. The respective values for the relatives of the female propositi are 0.59% (w = 846) and 0.66% (n = 6,962).
One possible explanation for the observation that a family history effect is more profound for male propositi than female propositi is that CHD is more genetically determined in males than females, i.e., for a given genotype, exogenous factors have a

greater influence in females than males in determining whether CHD will occur.
EFFECT OF SEX ON THE RISK OF CHD
Sex-modified polygenic inheritance is characterized by the more frequent hereditary transmission of the trait by the sex showing the lower population incidence of the trait (Carter, 1961). In the general pop-

ulation of Utah, as in other Caucasian populations, the sex ratio of CHD is about 5 to 1 in favor of females (Woolf and Turner, 1969)i Th;s marke(j sexual d;fference m a k e s

tives. The frequency of CHD would also be higher in the close relatives of male propositi than female propositi if the disorder were more genetically determined in males than females.
Although no differences are statistically significant, the close relatives of the male propositi do show an increased frequency of CHD. The male propositi have a higher frequency of affected sibs than the female propositi (5.33% [n = 169] vs. 3.85% [n = 728]). A higher frequency is also present in the other relatives (parents, second- and third-degree relatives) of the male propositi than the corresponding relatives of the female propositi (0.88% [n = 1,924]vs. 0.64% [n = 8,629]).
HERITABILITY OF CHD
Etiologic heterogeneity for CHD implies that genetic and nongenetic variation exists between affected and nonaffected individuals. Falconer (1965) developed a method for estimating heritability values for anomalies showing polygenic inheritance which employs the incidence of the disorder in the general population and the frequency in various groups of relatives. In the absence of nonadditive genetic variance, heritability (A2) is defined as the proportion of the total variance due to genetic differences between affected and nonaffected individuals.
Using incidence values of 0.02% and 0.10% for males and females, respectively, for the state of Utah (Woolf and Turner, 1969), Falconer's method applied to sibs (for which the frequency values are the most reliable) yields heritability values of about 82% and 58% for males and females, respectively. This method gives heritability values that are biased upwards if dominance or interaction between genes at different loci is present or if there are common family environmental factors of etiologic importance; however, even though the reliability of each estimate is in doubt, the difference between the two estimates does suggest that

exogenous factors are more important for females than males.
EFFECT OF BREECH MALPOSITION ON THE RISK OF C H D
Some cases of CHD might be classified as inborn errors of metabolism (Andren and Borglin, 1960, 1961a, 19616; Wilkinson, 1963). A developing fetus receives estrone and progesterone across the placenta. The fetal adrenal glands also produce progesterone, and the fetal ovaries produce estrone. These hormones produce minor degrees of joint laxity by their direct action on fetal ligaments. These hormones also stimulate the fetal uterus to produce a relaxin which accounts further for the greater degree of joint laxity in females. An enzyme system present in the normal fetal liver converts estrone and progesterone to inactive products which enter the maternal circulation and are excreted. A failure of this enzyme system may result in generalized ligamentous laxity which could initiate the chain of events leading to CHD.
Experimental work with rabbits has implicated the etiologic interaction of breech malposition and stress of hormones. Wilkinson (1963) splinted the hind limbs of young rabbits in breech malposition and stressed them with injections of estrone and progesterone. The females, but not the males, developed generalized joint laxity and atraumatic dislocation of the hip, resembling human congenital dislocation of the hip. Control rabbits, which were bound but not injected, showed neither joint laxity nor atraumatic dislocation. These results suggest that breech malposition in man may increase the likelihood of a hip disorder in those individuals with generalized joint laxity. (
Quasi-continuous variation for CHD would imply that a fetus with only a small number of the responsible genes (mildly predisposed to CHD) might demonstrate the disorder if stressed with breech malposition

The chi-square values for males border each side of the significance line while those for the females are substantially below the line. All differences have the sign specified by the breech-malposition effect. The frequencies of CHD in the sibs of the propositi who were nonbreech and breech cases, are 4.33% (n = 832) and 1.54% ( « = 65), respectively.

A season of birth effect for CHD has been well identified in the literature (Record and Edwards, 1958; Bailar and Gurian, 1965). Some exogenous factor such as temperature or cyclic maternal hormones may increase the probability of occurrence of CHD during the autumn and early winter months. The Utah data were used to test the hypothesis that cases born during the September-January period of the year are less genetically determined than those born during the FebruaryAugust period.

Instability of the pelvis, similar to generalized pelvic instability observed in infants with congenital hip disease, is not uncommon in pregnant women (Andren and Borglin, 1960).
