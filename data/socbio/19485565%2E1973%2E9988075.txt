Many individuals believe that marriage tends to induce the marriage partners to look like one another. The question to which this paper addresses itself is whether people perceive that a couple looks alike because of an actual preexisting or developed physiognomic homogamy or whether their perception is colored by the foreknowledge that the couple is married.
The psychological process of perception is an immediate one in which a subject simultaneously sees distinct objects, persons, configurations, and various aspects of continuity, contours, proportions, and directions. For example, optical illusions are determined for the viewer in part by his psychological set. Further, experience seems always to be selective, according to the motivational bias of the subject. Psychological selectivity illustrates this interrelationship between motivation and cognition, and between "effective" and "intellectual" processes (Sherif and Sherif, 1956). However, Cline and Richards in 1960 conducted a somewhat more complicated study of interpersonal relationships and rather surprisingly concluded that "there is a general ability to perceive others accurately. This particular general ability, however, consists of (at least) two

independent parts: sensitivity to the Generalized Other, and Interpersonal Sensitivity" (P. 6).
Since sincere people commonly assert that married people "look alike," the questions may be asked: Do married persons look alike to begin with? Do they grow to look alike? Or, is the "alikeness," simply a perceived phenomenon which can be correctly attributed to the "eye of the beholder"?
Freud presented the Oedipus selection concept of parent-substitution in mating, but no clear evidence has been produced. Sometimes there is physiognomic homogeneity between a man's wife and his mother or between a woman's husband and her father, but apparently these instances are coincidental, occurring no more frequently than by chance (Eckland, 1968). J. Richard Udry (1966), Anselm Strauss (1946), and others have investigated the idea "I want a girl just like the girl that married dear old Dad" and failed to find sufficient evidence that ideal mate image actually influenced ultimate mate selection.
In August, 1957, Evans' interview of Dr. Jung revealed agreement and disagreement with Freud relative to psychosexual

development. The expansion of the Oedipal complex as an example of archetype was expressed this way by Jung (Evans, 1964, p. 49):
. . . man has, of course, an inherited scheme of functioning which (is) expressed in the form of archetype forms . . . . You see, the archetype is a force. It has an autonomy, and it can suddenly seize you. It is like a seizure. So, for instance, falling in love at first sight, that is such a case. You have a certain image in yourself without knowing it, of the woman--a good imitation of your type, and instantly you get the seizure; you are caught . . . .
So psychologically inherited is your mate, Jung claims, that you instantly know when you see "her" that you should marry. However, so far as can be statistically stated at this point, there are no known physiognomic determining tendencies toward homogamously assortative mating.
J. N. Spuhler (1968) published a survey of the results of other researchers concerning the biological traits and physical characteristics of married couples with their estimates of the degrees of association. Of the 105 characteristics listed, Spuhler (1968, p. 128) notes that "aside from the 'age' and 'age at . . . ' characters, none of the associations . . . are strong" (our italics).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Over three-hundred college students were presented discrete head and shoulder pictures of five randomly matched couples of various specific durations of marriage to determine if marriage partners look alike close to their time of marriage and if they look more alike as years of marriage increase. In the study it was not feasible to procure pictures of proper quality of the same couple at the marriage date and subsequent anniversaries. Such a procedure would be very useful, however. We opted

to use a cross-sectional set of pictures of couples at various years of marriage.
Individual head and shoulder pictures of the married couples were taken of some residents of a small city in Utah who were in the middle socioeconomic bracket and who were willing to participate in such a study. Pictures were taken at the same time but each in a different frame. Tri-X film was used. A common plain background was used to control for any matching problems. The subjects were asked to look pleasant but natural so that no "posing" took place. Available lighting was used so that natural contrasting densities could be captured photographically.
Six groups of five couples each were used. In order to determine if there was any progressive growing to look alike, the sample was divided into the following categories: (1) less than one year of marriage; (2) approximately five years of marriage; (3) approximately 10 to IS years of marriage; (4) approximately IS to 20 years of marriage; (S) approximately 25 years of marriage; and (6) approximately 35 years of marriage. The couples whose pictures were used had been married only once. The members' ages within each group were homogeneous with a variance of not more than two years. The couples were of similar socioeconomic status, so that hair styling and dress quality were controlled. The pictures, grouped in sets of ten, were displayed on a screen by an overhead projector. The judges were told that the people were married and that we were interested in having them match those men and women whom they thought looked as if they were married to one another. No other information was given.
In order to obtain the expectations for each of the frequencies for correct matches, it was necessary to compute the probability of getting correct matches from zero through five. William Feller (1968) gave

the following probabilities for N = 5 in probability of correct matching and guessing problems: Po = 0.367, Pi = 0.375, P2 = 0.167, P 3 = 0.083, Pi = 0.000, and P5 = 0.008.
FINDINGS
Three hundred and five college students completed score sheets. Of these, 295 were used for the data in this study. The other

10 score sheets were coded improperly by the judges and were therefore not used. The number of judges in each age group was as follows: 16 to 19 years, 70; 20 to 25 years, 185; 26 to 30 years, 30; 31 to 35 years, 6; 36 to 45 years, 4. There were 170 males and 125 females. Of these, 226 were single and 69 were married.

rect matches by judges for couples married less than one year indicates that 13% fewer wrong responses were made in the zero row of correct matches than was expected by chance. The one row of correct matches was equal to chance. The 2, 3, and S rows matched correctly were significantly more than could be expected by chance, with 2 being the highest difference. This would appear to indicate that at least half of the couples are physiognomically homogamous.
For couples married approximately 5 years, the relationship between observed and expected frequencies of correct matches by the judges shows that in 0 and 1 rows fewer wrong responses were made than was expected by chance. In the 2,3, and S rows, again, the matches were considerably more than can be expected by chance, with the 3 rows of correct responses being the highest correlation. This would seem to indicate that there is a growing-to-look alike, physiognomically, as the years of marriage increase.
However, when we examine the couples of approximately 10 to IS years of marriage and compare the observed and expected frequencies of correct matches, there is a considerable drop in the observed over the expected frequencies, although it is only a negative 0.2% to a positive 1.6% difference. There is no significant difference between the observed frequencies and that expected by chance. Therefore, we cannot say that there is a continuing trend toward physiognomic homogamy.
For couples married approximately 15 to 20 years, the relationship between observed and expected frequencies of correct matches is only slightly better than that shown in the previous table for those couples married approximately 10 to IS years. The difference of correct matches ranges from a negative 0.8% to a positive 2.2%. Some sociologists have noted that

beginning around the ninth year of marriage, the quality of marital satisfaction decreases (Clark, 1965; Blood and Wolfe, 1960).
For those couples married from 20 to 25 years, a very significant departure from that expected by chance is indicated. 0 and 1 rows are well below chance expectations and 2, 3, and S rows are well above expectations and range from a positive 6.35% to 18.4%. This appears to indicate physiognomic homogamy.
For those couples who have been married for 35 years or more, the relationship between observed and expected frequencies of correct matches by judges shows the significance is at the 0.05 level. The difference is from a negative 0.8% to a positive 5.13%.
The pooling of chi-squares is shown in Table 2. The interpretation of this chi-

Table 3 shows the total distribution of correct matches and the gamma is a negative 0.02 which, interpreted, means that there is no significant association between slides one through six. The nega-

tive sign indicates that there is an inverse relationship, but, since the amount is so small, it cannot be considered significant.
DISCUSSION
The evidence apparently indicates that most couples that marry have some physiognomic homogamy. The correct matches by judges on couples in the first years of marriage support this position. This study does not support the first hypothesis that the. actual matches would be the same as or fewer than those which could be expected by chance. It does indicate (1) that people either seek out those who look like themselves; or (2) that, if the engagement period is of any length, the process of physiognomic homogamy has already started. The latter hypothesis could be tested by obtaining pictures of engaged couples and including them in the procedures herein described.
There is a peculiar disuniformity in the overall trend toward physiognomic homogeneity. There is a definite drop in the significance of matches for couples married between 10 and 20 years. There are factors which could contribute to what we might term here a "negative physiognomic trend" in marriage. These are the child-rearing years, in which much energy is devoted to the children, to separate social activities, and not to each other. The father, in particular, earning a livelihood, may be in-

volved much more with his work life than his home life. The ninth year and on (during child rearing) are considered the hardest for the marriage partners. With lack of communication probably involved, there maybe a tendency toward ever deepening, opposing attitudes, and perhaps, even antagonistic behavior patterns which could lead to physical changes.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
When asking if people who are married look alike, one must also define what is meant by "looking alike." Does the definition entail only physiognomic homogamy or do sociologically acquired traits ofmarried couples add to one's projection of homogamy?
There have been numerous studies since 1840 which have dealt with three general areas of assortative mating. First, exact measurements have been made on almost every physical characteristic (except physiognomy as defined herein). Second, the psychological traits of marriage partners have been measured. Third, sociological factors of monogamous marriages have been investigated. None of these studies has dealt with the question of physiognomic homogamy, which indeed could be the most effective predicator of all.
The inclination of the human mind to seek balance has been studied by several

researchers. They have found that interaction with others can change attitudes and behavior. Between marriage partners, close interaction and a desire to achieve unity can and does modify the individual's behavior and, possibly, ostensible physiognomical modifications occur (for an opposing view, see Knussmann, 1961).
Given pictures of couples at various stages of marriage, individuals were asked to match up partners. The findings indicate that there is physiognomic homogamy for married couples from marriage through approximately ten years. The years from 10 to 20 do not show physiognomic homogamy of any significance. The couples married 20 years and more again show a significant physiognomic homogamy as demonstrated by the number of correct matches. It is the

conclusion of this paper that there is indeed physiognomic homogamy among married couples (only one marriage era shows digression in detected physiognomic homogamy), but that there appears to be no significant trend in growing to look alike as persons live together as husband and wife.
Future studies should use more couples at each stage of marriage so that the judges have greater opportunity to make mistakes. Secondly, pictures might be obtained from couples for various points in their married lives and pictures prior to marriage might be obtained from school year books. Physiognomy among engaged couples could also be tested in this manner. It is hoped that further research along these lines will follow.
