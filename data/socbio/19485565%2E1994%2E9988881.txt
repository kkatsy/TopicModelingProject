We have observed that Micronesian populations are now and have been in the past characteristically highly masculinized at birth (i.e., secondary sex ratios of over 108-110). From an evolutionary perspective, we are interested in asking how this finding may reflect or promote microevolutionary change in this island setting. Particularly because sex-selective infanticide is not a plausible explanation of this pattern in the region, we have concentrated on examining aspects of reproductive behavior in Micronesia for clues to proximate/remote mechanisms that may promote this pattern of male versus female births. We have identified several key, unique features of the reproductive complex of Micronesian island populations (Brewis, 1993; Underwood, 1990a,b). One of the most singular defining features of the reproductive pattern of these groups is high coital rates, maintained against age and marriage duration.
Our initial forays into the possibility of an association between secondary, sex ratios (SSR) and coital behavior was precipitated by James' own extensive discussions (e.g., James, 1987, 1990), although he has recently expressed doubts about the nature of the exact mechanism, and whether the association is direct or indirect (James,

1994). Our argument is not that the sex ratios at birth represent a priori evidence of high coital rates with age, but rather, SSR patterns in Micronesia are a corollary of the unique biobehavioral reproductive features of these island groups, which includes high coital rates.
Professor James' concerns with our papers appear to relate to two considerations: (1) the statistical aspect of results from small scale populations: and (2) the veracity and reliability of results from ethnographic research. It is regrettable that Professor James appears not to be familiar with the techniques and methodology employed by modern ethnographers in their field studies. These methods entail extensive and intensive cross-checking, multiple verification, and repeated re-evaluation of information collected from a large number of independent sources. As observer-participants, we each used a wide range of data to reach actual findings rather than merely generate hypotheses about " . . . a Micronesian pattern of marital sexuality."
For example, in the Butaritari case, conclusions are drawn from several very different, but consistent, lines of evidence that show coital rates are maintained with age and marriage duration in this group: ethnographic data

showing the marriage relationship

maintains a highly sexualized and

charged emotional environment, de-

mographic data showing no effective

reduction in fertility through the first

two decades of marriage, and women's

own reports of frequent sexual activity

through their life cycles.

As two anthropological demogra-

phers working in the smallest-scale set-

tings, we use tools and data types that

are more appropriate to small samples,

often different than those for which

Professor James notes a preference,

namely large-scale survey or census

samples. We gladly acknowledge the

limits of the "minute samples," and

consistently argue against the overuse

of statistical inference under such con-

ditions, especially since the very defin-

ing demographic nature of small island

populations is the inherency of sto-

chasm.

r.

What we lose in statistical "power"

from working with small, relatively

circumscribed populations, we believe

we more than gain back in being able

to conceptualize, contextualize, com-

pare, and cross-check sufficiently to

make informed and balanced judg-

ments about such demographic scenar-

ios. So, while our counts are often

comparatively small (compared to the

21 million births recorded in England

and Wales in 1938-68, for example),

we are able to describe a population

sample that is essentially both geo-

graphically and temporally complete

(and effective). In fact, in the case of

the sex ratios arguments we have cov-

ered almost all births in these popula-

tions over the last century, and we have sample sizes in the thousands. We consider these acceptable for use of chi-square and sufficient to make inferences about variations in sex ratios by age group as they relate to coital activity.
Patterns of sexual behavior, including how often people have sex, vary markedly among human groups-- something anthropologists have long noted anecdotally and have more recently begun to document systematically and seriously. More specifically, Euroamerican marital sexuality does not define the universal pattern of our species--a fact for which some might be grateful.
If Professor James prefers data from larger (and specifically nonanthropological) samples, we offer the results of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), which have used very consistent methods and large sample sizes. Of the series of national samples discussed by Blanc and Rutenberg (1991), many showed declining coital rates with age when marriage duration was controlled. However, one stayed stable, and several actually increased. They conclude there is "no consistent pattern [of coital frequency] by age . . . once marriage duration has been controlled" (p. 171). In closing, might we suggest that a charge of a "return to romance" might be best applied to those who cannot accept fieldworkbased conclusions about human sexual behavior in island settings as anything other than exotic and erotic.
