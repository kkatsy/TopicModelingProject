ABSTRACT: It is often asserted that sexual promiscuity and drug abuse appears to share a common etiology in poor parental attachment. This study explores this claim empirically among 480 college students. Other variables--religiosity, masculinity/femininity, sex, age, and physical appearance--that may enhance or reduce the incidence of promiscuity and drug use were included in multivariate analyses. Parental attachment was significantly related to both variables, and the combination of poor parental attachment and drug use was a strong predictor of promiscuity for both males and females. In multivariate analyses, religiosity was the most important predictor of promiscuity for males, and attachment was the most important for females. The findings are examined guided by the three desiderata commonly accepted as relevant to biosocial attachment theory.

demonstrated. Individuals lacking a sense of parental attachment will tend to be anxious and insecure, making later peer attachments and committed monogamous romantic attachments problematic (Kernberg, 1974; Shaver et al., 1988).
Regardless of its origins, promiscuity is often viewed as a manifestation of some underlying pathology. Although in some contexts it may be adaptive (Buss and Schmitt, 1993), in the larger and more general context it may minimize fitness, and it runs counter to normative social expectations (Timmreck, 1990; Udrey, 1988; Hinde and Stevenson-Hinde, 1990). Frost and Chapman (1987) found "polymorphous sexuality" (the range of sexual interests, attitudes, fantasies, and behavior) to be related to psychosis proneness in two separate studies. However, they were careful to make a distinction between polymorphous sexuality and "hypersexuality" (promiscuity), which they indicate is more characteristic of manic-depression.
Some attachment theorists view sexual promiscuity as offering a series of temporary balms for anxiety, insecurity, and depression that achieve much the same effect as do the various tranquilizers, narcotics, and sedatives (Hatfield, 1988). Studies of the antecedents of substance abuse often find it linked to lack of emotional attachments/commitments to others and to self-rejection (Jessor and Jessor, 1977; Textor, 1987; Kaplan et al., 1988; Shedler and Block, 1990). Thus, it has been suggested that drug abuse and sexual promiscuity may be etiologically and functionally analogous in that they are alternative methods of dulling the

pains of anxiety and insecurity that are the sequelae of nonattachment (Shaver et al., 1988; Collins and Read, 1990).
Liebowitz (1983, p. 57) argues that promiscuous individuals are "love addicts" driven by the need for phenylethylamine (PEA), an amphetaminelike drug that is endogenously secreted in response to mating opportunities. He views the constant craving for new partners as craving for new highs as tolerance for the old lover (actually, for PEA) sets in (see also, Ellis, 1991a). Although there may be resistance to the idea that promiscuous sexuality may be chemically and psychologically equivalent to drug addiction, Peele and Brodsky (1975, p. 68) find it "not unreasonable to look for addiction among lovers when psychologists find the roots of drug addiction in childhood dependency needs and stunted family relations. . . . In this sense, addictive love is even more directly linked to what are recognized to be the sources of addiction than is drug dependency" (see also Timmreck, 1990).
From a biosocial perspective, Hinde and Stevenson-Hind (1990, p. 65) claim that there are three closely linked desiderata relevant to attachment theory: (1) to maximize an individual's inclusive fitness, i.e., the lifetime reproductive success of an individual and his or her close relatives; (2) to conform to the values of society; and (3) to achieve psychological well-being. Promiscuity and drug abuse violate these alleged desiderata. Evolutionary theorists assert that because of differential parental investment, males and females have evolved different mating strategies; sexual restrictiveness for females and sexual

unrestrictiveness for males (Symons, 1979, 1992; Wilson, 1983; Buss, 1989; Ellis, 1989/1990; Kenrick et al., 1990; Buss and Schmitt, 1993). Of course, mating strategies are facultative, not fixed, and it is clear that both strategies are open to both sexes.
However, the fitness penalties attached to female unrestrictiveness are potentially so severe that psychological and neurological mechanisms are rather strongly biased in the direction of restrictiveness for females, particularly in a long-term mate. The fear of cuckoldry leads males to abandon unrestricted women (Trivers, 1972; Wilson, 1983), and among dating couples, partners of restrictive females are more committed to them than are partners of unrestrictive females (Gangestad and Simpson, 1990). A national probability sample of 815 American males found that 67 per cent reported disliking women who made love too early in the relationship (Walsh, 1991a, p. 226), and Buss and Schmitt (1993) found that men considered promiscuity to be the least desirable attribute in a prospective long-term mate (although slightly desirable in a prospective short-term mate).
Some evolutionary theorists suggest that females with poor attachment experiences advance their reproductive fitness by adopting a strategy of unrestricted sexuality (Gangestad and Simpson, 1990; Belsky et al., 1991). These theorists agree that restricted sexuality, while generally constituting the "optimum" strategy for females in most environmental contexts because it increases the probability of paternal investment, is not always psychologically viable for women who have

learned that close relationships are undependable and ephemeral.1 The strategy of unrestricted sexuality allegedly increases a female's chances of mating with a "quality" (high status) male, thus producing a genetically "quality" offspring, despite the risk of losing paternal parental investment (see Hinde, 1991, and Maccoby, 1991, for critiques). Needless to say, neither strategy is consciously "chosen," but rather flow from differential expectations of stability/instability of interpersonal relationships based on past experience.
Because evolutionary theorists view males as more strongly selected for promiscuity than females, a measure of masculinity/femininity was included in this study. High scores on the masculinity scale of the Bern Sex Role Inventory (Bern, 1977) have been found to correlate positively with testosterone levels, extraversion, sensation-seeking, and a large number of sexual partners; high femininity scores have been found to be negatively related to these variables (Daitzman and Zuckerman, 1980).
Testosterone is the hormonal mediator of sexual arousal in both males and females. Thus, it is assumed that high masculinity scores (because masculinity has been linked to testosterone levels) will be associated with a greater number of coital partners for both sexes, independent of attachment. As Nyborg and Boeggild (1989, p. 29) put it, testosterone switches women off
1Symons(1992) writes that human beings are selected to strive for specific goals (to be "adaptation executors"), not for the general goal of being "fitness maximizers": "There can be no such thing as a generalized reproduction-maximizer mechanism because there is no general, universally effective way to maximize reproduction" (p. 139).

their "safety first approach and onto a more masculine approach" [to sexual activity]. In fact, although adult males have 10 to 20 times more unbound (activating) testosterone than adult females, elevated testosterone has a greater influence on female sexuality (Udry, 1988). Among androgennormal males there are "ceiling effects" beyond which additional testosterone has no activating influence (Ellis, 1986; Udry, 1988). Thus, high masculinity scores may have more effect on female than male sexuality.
The reviewed literature on promiscuity has been almost exclusively concerned with female promiscuity, the assumption being that males have a strong propensity to be promiscuous, and that what we need to explain in the male case is what makes them otherwise. A variable which may have an inhibiting affect on sexual behavior with multiple partners, as well as on drug abuse, is religiosity. Most major religions consider nonmarital sex to be immoral (Burkett and Warren, 1986), and there is perhaps no other behavior where violation of moral standards is so enduring and encompassing. Sexual promiscuity has been found to be significantly negatively related to religiosity, regardless of whether religiosity is measured attitudinally (Udrey, 1988; Rosenbaum and Kandel, 1990) or behaviorally in terms of church attendance (Libby et al., 1978). Although the cited research was conducted with adolescents, there is no reason to suppose that religiosity would not have a similar effect on adults.
Because it is usually the male who initiates sexual activity (Glaser and Thorpe, 1986; Ellis, 19916), variables that serve to inhibit sexual activity,

such as religiosity or femininity, should have greater impact on men than on women. Men ask; women get asked. Thus, the rate of asking should be related to various measured characteristics, but getting asked should be relatively unrelated to them. An exception to this may be physical attractiveness. Using interviewer's subjective assessments of attractiveness, Udry and Billy (1987) found no significant effects of attractiveness on coital behavior. It is difficult to believe that such an important facilitator of dating behavior (Feingold, 1990) has no effect on coital behavior, although the direction of its effect may be problematic. Attractive feminine women may be asked more often, but their attractiveness may afford them the luxury of being more discriminating. Buss (1988) found that women of high mate value (defined primarily in terms of physical attractiveness) were more discriminating than women of low mate value. On the other hand, more masculine women may go beyond the simple exercise of veto power and do the asking themselves. Therefore, it was deemed advisable to include a measure of selfreported physical appearance in the study. We expect that physical appearance will be positively related to number of coital partners for males and negatively related for females.
In summary, this paper explores the effect of poor parental attachment on sexual activity and drug abuse. It is hypothesized that individuals who have learned that interpersonal relationships are reliable and stable will have fewer sex partners and be less involved with drugs than those who have learned that such relationships are unreliable and transient. Other variables

that may impact these behaviors by predisposing, facilitating, or inhibiting them, such as religiosity, masculinity/ femininity, appearance, and age will be examined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The sample consists of 480 university undergraduates (211 males and 269 females) enrolled in three classes at Boise State University. The modal number of coital partners is 1 for both males and females, with the median being 5 for males and 3 for females. Males had a mean of 10.81 partners (95% ci. = ± 1.88), and females had a mean of 5.75 partners (95% ci. = ± 0.82). Means and standard deviations of all variables, broken down by gender, are presented in Table 2.
The childhood attachment index consists of six items in Likert format designed to tap the amount of love, caring, respect, value, and happiness subjects perceived themselves as receiving from their parents as children and adolescents (Table 1). Possible scores on this index ranged between 5 and 30; actual scores ranged frcm 8 to 30. A reliability coefficient of 0.865 was computed from these data.
Drug usage was assessed by asking subjects the approximate number of times they had tried illegal drugs. Actual values were coded between zero and 9 times, with a score of 9 indicating that the subject had taken drugs 9 or more times. It is acknowledged that this strategy resulted in the loss of variation in the higher range, but the analysis was constrained by data coding. The modal category for both sexes was zero (44.2 per cent for males and 52.7

per cent for females). The second largest category for both sexes was 9 or more times (34.6 per cent for males and 25.9 per cent for females). Thus, 21.2 per cent of the males and 21.4 per cent of the females were drug "experimenters."
Masculinity and femininity are measured by the Bern Sex Role Inventory (Bern, 1977). The reliability coefficient computed from the present data for this scale is 0.888.
Physical appearance was selfassessed. Each subject was asked to rate satisfaction with eight body parts (height, weight, chest/bust, buttocks, face, hair, genitals, and overall body build) on a scale ranging from 1 to 9. Scores ranged from 27 to 70. A reliability coefficient of 0.791 was computed from these data.
The religiosity variable was measured using both behavioral and attitudinal referents. Behaviorally, subjects were asked how often they attend religious services for the purpose of worship: never, a few times a year, once a month, once a week, or more than once a week. Subjects were also asked how important their religion was to

them on a 10-point scale (Udry, 1988). The two measures were highly correlated (r = 0.71) and were combined into a single religiosity factor. Scores on this index ranged from 2 to 14, with a possible maximum of 15.
RESULTS
Table 2 presents correlations (male above, female below) between all variables and their means and standard deviations. Correlations between pairs of variables that differ significantly (Fishers r to Z transformation) between the sexes are underlined. Table 3 presents f-tests for differences between male and female means for all variables. Males had significantly more coital partners, experienced more drug use, and rated their masculinity and appearance significantly higher than females. Females were significantly more feminine. There are no significant differences between the sexes on attachment, religiosity, and age.
The number of sexual partners means reported here underestimates male national means (12.26) and overestimates female national means (3.22) based on a NORC representative sample of 1,401 adult Americans (Smith, 1991). This finding is probably due to the smaller age variability in the present sample.
Subjects' evaluations of their parental attachment experiences are negatively and significantly related to sexual promiscuity (the less the attachment, the greater the number of sexual partners). The frequency of drug usage is positively related to number of sexual partners, particularly for females, although the f-test results show that

males were more likely to have used drugs.
Religiosity is significantly and rather strongly negatively related to promiscuity for males, but only weakly so for females, even though the i-test shows essentially identical religiosity means for both genders. Masculinity is significantly and positively, but weakly, related to number of coital partners for both genders; femininity has a significant negative effect for males, but no significant effect for females.
Masculinity and femininity are both negatively and significantly associated with drug usage among males, a finding that perhaps suggests a certain amount of sex-role ambivalence among male drug users. No relationship between drug usage and masculinity or femininity is observed for females.
A negative evaluation of one's appearance is associated with more sexual partners among females, but no significant relationship is observed among males. High masculinity among males is associated with a more positive evaluation of appearance, but high masculinity among females is associated with a negative evaluation of appearance. Femininity scores have no effect on appearance evaluation for either sex. High femininity scores are associated with high religiosity for both sexes, particularly for males.
I next regressed all variables on number of sexual partners. With the exception of appearance, all variables entered the equation with significance levels less than 0.05 (1-tail). The impact of childhood attachment and drug abuse is diminished given the presence of other variables in the model, with age and religiosity being the most powerful predictor variables. The model

accounts for an impressive 46.8 per cent of the variance in number of coital partners.
The determinants of drug usage were then addressed via multiple regression. Only religiosity, attachment, and femininity entered the model, all of which are negatively related to drug usage. Age, sex, and masculinity, all significantly related to drug usage at the zero-order level, failed to enter the regression equation. We are able to say, then, that the less attached, the less religious, and the less feminine a person is, the more likely he or she is to use drugs, with attachment being the most powerful predictor.
Turning to the gender-specific models regressing all variables on number of coital partners in Table 5, we note that, apart from age, religiosity is the most powerful predictor for males, but the least powerful for females. Drug usage is the most powerful predictor for females, and the least important for males. Attachment is the most consistent predictor across the two models. Of greater interest are the variables that operate in different directions for males and females. Femininity is negatively related with number of sexual

partners for males, but positively related for females. Likewise, a positive evaluation of one's appearance results in significantly more sexual partners for males, but significantly fewer for females.
The male model accounts for considerably more of the variance in number of coital partners than does the female model. The larger proportion of variance accounted for in the male model confirms suspicions that personal attributes have more influence on initiators of behavior (usually males) than on those who generally exercise only veto power (females). Similar differences in gender-specific models of sexuality among adolescents were reported by Udry (1988), i.e., adjusted R squared values of 0.49 and 0.32 for males and females, respectively.
DISCUSSION
Empirical support for the hypothesis that sexual promiscuity and drug abuse may have a common cause in the failure of parental attachment is provided by these findings. Subjects reporting weak parental attachment were more involved in unrestricted sexuality and reported more drug usage than subjects reporting stronger parental attachment. Unrestricted sexual encounters may function as chemical "balms" for the insecurity wrought by poor attachment experiences in the same way that drugs may function (Hatfield, 1988). The affectual process is a continuous one, with each stage preparing the individual for the next one in a straight-line progression (Hazan and Shaver, 1987). Any break in this chain leaves the individual without an adequate foundation from

which to build increasingly complex affectional relationships, including committed romantic pair-bonding.
How can these findings be situated within the theoretical framework of attachment theory? Within the present sample, the lack of attachment experience leads to promiscuity for both men and women. Thus, while this lack has predictable negative fitness effects for women, it apparently has positive effects for males. That is, for males, poor

parental attachment apparently enhances the male's alleged tendency toward promiscuity, and thus his reproductive potential. For females, poor parental attachment reduces the female's alleged tendency toward restrictiveness, which reduces the probability of male commitment and paternal investment.
Interpretation of these data must include the fact that we are cultural animals who direct our behavior toward

goals which often have nothing to do with the maximization of inclusive fitness and mayactually runcounter to it, even when thegoals aresexual ones. The plasticity of human beings is a double-edged sword that can lead to maladaptive as well as adaptive behavior (Symons, 1979, p. 307).The relationship between current behaviorand an adaptation depends on the consistency between the distal environmental features leading to selection of the adaptation andthemore proximate environmental context in which it is expressed (Thornhill and Thornhill, 1992). Within early evolutionary environments, male promiscuity mayhave exerted pressure for selection, but in terms of later cultural conditions such behavior might prove to be counterproductive to fitness. As Shaver et al. (1988, p. 94) put it, "The function of

attachment between adult lovers may be primarily to increase the likelihood of parental health, stability, andinvestment in offspring." Long-term evolutionary success may be better achieved by producing fewer, high quality offspring in a committed relationship than by maximizing number of offspring in promiscuous mating (Chisholm,1993, p. 3; Buss and Schmitt, 1993, p. 221).
Commitment to child rearing certainly conforms to social values, and religiosity supports such a value. Commitment to religious values serves asa brake to unrestrictive sexual behavior and to drug use. The fact that it inhibits male sexuality more than female sexuality is not surprising. Religiosity prevents males from pursuing sexual favors, but a female's religious values to not preclude her from being pursued. They can, of course, prompt her

to refuse sexual overtures. But if she is asked often enough, especially in the context of romantic involvement rather than in the context of impulsive sexual gratification, she will eventually accede (Juhasz and Sonnenshein, 1987).
Masculinity and femininity have diverse effects across the sexes. Masculinity is positively related and femininity is negatively related to number of coital partners among males, but only masculinity is associated (positively) with number of partners among females. Feminine women may be asked for coitus more often than masculine women, but masculine women may be more inclined to accept the offers they receive. Masculine women may also take the assertive approach in sexual matters and initiate the encounter themselves. A recent study found masculinity to be more strongly correlated with sexual "game playing" among females than among males (Walsh, 1993).
Drug use remained a significant predictor of number of partners for both sexes with all other predictor variables in the regression models. However, it plays a very minor role for males while for females it has about the same effect as attachments. Females with an extensive history of drug use can reasonably be considered more disinhibited than most other females, but while it is probably also true that males who use drugs are more disinhibited than males who do not, there is no reason to posit that this disinhibition necessarily pushes them beyond the already high level of sex-seeking that characterizes most males. Being part of a drug subculture, however, places them in the company of sexually unrestricted fe-

males, thus increasing their opportunities for sex.
Other than age, a variable not requiring comment, the remaining significant predictor variable is subjective evaluation of physical appearance. A positive evaluation is significantly positively related to number of sexual partners among males, but significantly negatively related among females. This finding is understandable if we consider the evaluation of one's physical appearance to be an indicator of overall self-esteem, and if we can agree with Robertson (1987, p. 250) that sexual intercourse is seen as a conquest for males and as a surrender for females, and that a man's status is enhanced by his conquest and a woman's cheapened by her surrender (also, see Juhasz and Sonnenshein-Schneider, 1987). A man who considers his appearance to be somewhat inadequate may be timid about approaching females sexually. Conversely, a lack of success in this area may lead him to devalue his appearance. This view is supported by Walsh (19916) who found that male virgins had significantly lower selfesteem than sexually active males, but female virgins and nonvirgins did not differ significantly on self-esteem.
A woman with a high evaluation of her appearance may feel that she has the luxury of being discriminating about with whom she becomes intimate, because she is likely to be the recipient of more dating offers (Feingold, 1990). She is freer than her physically less desirable sisters from the necessity to compromise with the shortterm mating strategy of males, and is thus more likely to "obtain a longterm mate of high quality who is willing to commit resources and parental
