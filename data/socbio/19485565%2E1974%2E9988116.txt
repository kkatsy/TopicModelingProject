Studies of the effect of interracial crossing on fetal mortality in man have failed to detect any effect due to hybridity of the fetus (Morton et al., 1967). In a recent analysis of the effects of minor outcrossing on fetal mortality in Rhode Island Caucasians, Bresler (1970) reported an increase of 2.S to 3 per cent fetal loss "with each additional country of birth in the great-grandparental generation (P3)." In order to further examine this question, we have reanalyzed the data of Morton et al. (1967) with respect to minor or intraracial hybridity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data were collected by Morton and his coworkers from the birth records of the state of Hawaii for 1948-58 inclusive (Morton et al., 1967).
For the present study, the data were divided into three subsamples: (1) Oriental, which includes Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and their hybrids; (2) Caucasoid, which includes Caucasians (primarily U.S. continental whites), Puerto Ricans, and their hybrids; and (3) Hawaiian, which

contrasts Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians with others (excluding Caucasians) and the different hybrids.
Within each subsample, an index of hybridity was assigned to each record according to a diallele cross model (Morton et al., 1967). As an example, the scheme for the Oriental group is presented in Table 1. Values range from 0, for an incross, to 1, for a cross between different ethnic groups. The basic model then is the regression of fetal death on this index of hybridity.
Because of large differences in sample size, for instance between Caucasians and Puerto Ricans, a variable reflecting the proportion of, in this instance, Puerto Rican ancestry was introduced into the regression as a correction factor. In addition, all socioeconomic variables considered by Morton et al. (1967)1 which were found significant by stepwise regression in the present analysis were included in the final regressions to eliminate their effect on the fetal death rate. The same analysis was then applied to neonatal deaths (less than one month) and to postneonatal in-

partial regression coefficients and corresponding values of t = Z>/a&. No significant effect of hybridity on fetal death was evident in any of the three groups. It is of some interest that the effect in all groups, although not significantly different from zero, is negative, showing decreased fetal mortality with increasing hybridity. This is contrary to Bresler's result, which gives internal evidence of inadequate control over socioeconomic factors in anamnestic material (Morton, 1974).

hybridity fails to reach significance even before correction for socioeconomic differences. Since it seems unlikely that these two samples of 55,995 and 44,835 pregnancy terminations would fail to detect an effect as large as that reported by Bresler (1970), this study does not support the model he proposes.
With respect to neonatal mortality, the effect of hybridity presents a somewhat different picture. The intraracial comparisons show no significant effect of hybridity,

while the Hawaiian analysis shows a very highly significant positive effect of hybridity. Further examination of the data revealed this effect to be due to hybridity of the mother, rather than the child, and suggests to us that this may be due to an uncontrolled bias due to the special environmental position of "Hawaiians" among the major ethnic groups in Hawaii (Morton et al., 1967).
The results of the analysis of postneonatal infant mortality (which is extremely sensitive to environmental factors) are even more heterogeneous. As can be seen from Table 2, the Caucasoid sample exhibits a highly significant positive effect of hybridity on infant death. The Oriental sample, on the other hand, shows no evidence of such an effect, while the Hawaiian sample has a negative effect which approaches significance at the 0.05 level. Uncorrected for socioeconomic variables, the Caucasian and Hawaiian samples show an effect of hybridity which is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign (Caucasian, b = + 0.0043 ± 0.0019; Hawaiian, b = -- 0.0047 ± 0.0018). We hesitate to assign genetic significance to these results. It must be remembered that this analysis does not consider interfamily variation, nor can it possibly provide perfect control over environmental variables, whose measurement is subject to error. As Table 2

shows, there is no consistent effect of hybridity on mortality, whether the error is taken to be binomial (xx2) or as residual heterogeneity (Fi,8).
SUMMARY
An examination of the effect of hybridity on fetal, neonatal, and postneonatal infant mortality is made in two intraracial samples, one Oriental (N = 55,995) and one Caucasoid (¿V = 44,835), and one interracial sample, Hawaiian with other non-Caucasians (N = 97,451). In the three analyses of fetal mortality, the effect of hybridity, although not significant, was in the direction of decreased mortality. There is no consistent effect of hybridity on neonatal or postneonatal infant death.
These data on registered births, based on very large samples and with covariance analysis for socioeconomic variables, provide no support for Bresler's hypothesis that with increased mixture of gene pools, fetal loss increases proportionately. I t is conjectured that his results were due to inadequate control of nongenetic factors in anamnestic data.
