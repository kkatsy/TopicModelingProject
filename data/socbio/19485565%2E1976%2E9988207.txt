The purpose of this investigation is to examine the influence of changing socioeconomic conditions on the distribution of maternal age in two small human populations closely connected with each other by immediate geographical proximity and administrative links but with entirely different histories.
The statistical data were collected from the birth registers of two neighboring parishes, Froso and Ostersund, in the province of Jamtland in Sweden for the two periods 1800-20 and 1840-60.
Froso comprises an island with the same name in Lake Storsjon and has been known since early historical times as a center of trade, administration, and culture. The ancient road from the far north to the central and southern provinces of the Scandinavian peninsula and to the European continent touched on Froso. It was also on the trade route of the Jamtland peasants when taking their wares--furs, leather goods, horses, copper, and silver ore--to Norway as well as to the markets of southern Sweden. As early as the thirteenth century, it was on the pilgrims' road to Trondheim. Its three annual markets, and especially the St. Gregor market, attracted numerous merchants, farmers, and

craftsmen from Norway and Sweden from the beginning of fifteenth century. Situated 468 meters above sea-level and 176 meters above Lake Storsjon, Froso was also an important military outpost. The fort, built in 1611, played an important role during the war against Norway. Froso School, founded in 1674, developed over a period of 170 years a significant educational activity and cultural influence.
At the end of the eighteenth century, Froso gradually lost its importance because a new town, Ostersund, was built on the opposite shore of the lake, and this town became the capital of Jamtland. Ostersund was founded by royal ordinance in 1786. The allocation of building plots for the settlers in the projected town began in 1788, but the interest was slight, and in 1790 the town had only 21 inhabitants. It was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that the number of inhabitants exceeded a thousand.
To stimulate the development of the new town, several institutions were transferred there, mainly from Froso: the pharmacy in 1788, the post office in 1797, the annual St. Gregor market in 1798, and the customs house from Duved in 1817. Yet, the development of Ostersund proceeded very slowly

As many as 19.3 per cent more women in Ostersund than in Froso had delivered below the age of 30 years. This fact can be attributed to the improved economic conditions in the town which made earlier marriage possible. At the same time, in impoverished Froso, the surplus of women aged 30 years and more at parturition rose from 2.1 per cent in the early period of the nineteenth century to 18.3 per cent in the years 1840-60. In all, as many as 66.9 per cent of mothers in Froso were 30 years and older at time of delivery as compared with only 47.6 per cent in Ostersund.
Compared with Sweden in the nineteenth century as a whole, the demographic situation in the new town must have been markedly different. In the first decades, 6.0 per cent fewer childbearing women in Ostersund than in Sweden as a whole were 30 years and over. During the following period, this difference increased to 12.8 per cent.
The mean maternal age during the first period under examination was 30.7 years in Ostersund and 31.6 years in Froso. During the following decades, the differences between the compared populations changed remarkably. The mean maternal age dropped in Ostersund to 28.8 years and, at the same time, increased in the neighboring parish to 32.2 years. Thus, the differences between the two populations increased from 0.9 to 3.4 years. In Sweden as a whole,

the mean maternal age remained constant during the nineteenth century at about 31 years.
In Ostersund, particularly during 184060, the risk of childbirth not only extended over a longer period of life but also was concentrated in the more favorable segments of the reproductive period. From this fact one might expect an increased effective fertility as well as a relative decrease of congenital malformations and diseases associated with high maternal age, e.g., Down's syndrome.
The expected incidence of Down's syndrome in the examined populations has been calculated with the aid of coefficients of age-dependent risk given by Coliman and Stroller (1962) with the results shown in Table 2. Because of the different maternal age distributions, the calculated incidence of Down's syndrome per thousand births is for both periods of time higher in Froso than in Ostersund. Figure 1 shows how the calculated incidence of Down's syndrome per thousand births in the population varies with the observed maternal age distributions in the two parishes and in nineteenth-century Sweden. The observations can thus be fitted into a model showing how social changes via maternal age changes have an impact on the incidence of congenital malformations in a population.
