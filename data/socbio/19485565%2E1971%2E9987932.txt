A number of authors have commented upon the relationship between the incidence of childlessness among women, and their age at first marriage (Grabill, Kiser, and Whelpton, 1958; Grabill and Glick, 19S9; Mitra, 1966; Relé, 1965; Thompson and Lewis, 1965; Titmuss and Grundy, 1946). The explanation for the observed correlation is generally implicitly attributed to the influence of physiological factors. For example, after noting that "voluntary childlessness is nearly extinct . . . and . . . fecundity impairments are now the chief cause of childlessness . . .", Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson (1966, p. 165) simply comment:
The influence of age at marriage on the proportion of couples with no children is striking. Among wives in the 1921-25 cohorts, the proportion childless for those who married at ages 21 or less (61% of all wives) is 6%, for those marrying at ages 22 to 25 it is 11%, and for those marrying at ages 25 and over it is 20%.
The purpose of the present research is to further exemplify the relationship between age at marriage and childlessness by presenting data for high and low fertility groups.
There are at least three logical reasons for expecting that the major variables in

the correlation of childlessness and age at marriage are biological in nature. First, women who marry relatively late in life are exposed to the risk of pregnancy for fewer years than younger brides. Thomlinson makes no direct reference to the factor of age at first marriage, but commenting on racial differences in childlessness he notes:
The higher proportion of childless women among whites than among nonwhites is partially explained by the fact that white women are married for an average of two thirds of their childbearing years, whereas nonwhite women on the average are married for only about half of their potentially fecund age period (Thomlinson, 1965, p. 175).
Second, fecundity tends to decline with age, and the later marriage is postponed, the lower the chances that one will be able to bear even one child (Womble, 1966, p. 382; Thomlinson, 1965, p. 148). Third, those women who marry for the first time very late, after the age of 40, may already be experiencing the beginning of menopause and rapidly approaching total sterility. It is suggested that even though each of these arguments are to some extent valid, demographers have generally tended to overestimate the importance of
