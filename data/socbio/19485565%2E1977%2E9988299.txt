ABSTRACT: The Lipoprotein Family Study of Japanese-Americans in Hawaii is described. Measured effects of the behavioral, social, and physiological milieu (apart from age and sex) account for little of the variance. Subsequent papers will consider the genetic and cultural causes of family resemblance in this material.

O.OScr and decreases HDL cholesterol by 0.Her even when other factors are held constant (Table 6).
Factors like acculturation, social class, exercise, and diet were assessed by questionnaire for the paternal sample only (Belsky et al., 1971). These factors were combined with age, sex, and other factors noted above into indices which estimate their effects on the various lipoprotein traits in the fathers (Morton et al., 1977).

For children and spouses, these unobserved factors were substituted for paternal values.
For each lipoprotein trait, multiple regression gave an index Y based on all covariates and an index Z when only age and sex variables were used. Then Y - Z is an index adjusted for age and sex. Table 6 shows that the adjusted index accounts for little more variation than the individual factors (smoking, alcohol, obesity, and hematocrit). Orr et al. (1975) reported that socioeconomic status accounts for only 1.8 and 0.6 per cent of the age-adjusted variance of In cholesterol in Caucasian males and females, respectively. In substantial agreement, we find that the adjusted index, which includes behavioral and physiological as well as social factors, accounts for only 2.3 per cent of the variance of cholesterol.

increase in coronary heart disease (Kagan et al., 1975).
Although behavioral, social, and physiological determinants as measured ac~ count for little of the variance of Iipoprotein concentrations, this finding does not prove that environment makes a small contribution to family resemblance. Path analysis gives an estimate of the unmeasured proportion of family environment. Providing this proportion is not too large,

cultural and biological inheritance can be resolved. The relative variance due to family environment is small in nuclear families (Rao et al., 1977), but is greater for twins (Iselius, ms.). Assessment of measurable determinants is a first step toward conclusions of this nature, providing indices which permit resolution of cultural and biological inheritance in nuclear families without requiring twins or adopted children (Rao et al., 1976).
