Postoperative questionnaire inquiries into psychological after-effects of vasectomy have shown consistent low proportions of men reporting deleterious effects in Western countries, over a period now spanning forty years (Popenoe, 1929; Alderman, 196S; Simon Population Trust, 1969). On the other hand, similarly conducted surveys of Indian populations have revealed very much higher proportions (Dandekar, 1963; Kakar, 1969; Batliwalla, 1967).
This large variation may be related to the fact that in the West vasectomy is usually freely chosen by men on their own initiative to serve their private purposes, while in Asia it is being solicited by governments with national rather than individual interests at heart.
However, recent research has aroused skepticism of the highly favorable reports of psychological adjustment recorded in postoperative questionnaires and interviews in the West too. Successful psychological adjustment to vasectomy requires of the vasectomized man a reduction in the anxiety aroused by associated unconscious fears of

castration, genital mutilation, and loss of masculinity. Defense mechanisms such as dissonance reduction, overcompensation, and selective perception are brought into play in the effort to reduce anxiety over the outcome of an unalterable decision, leading to demonstrable discrepancies between overt claimed satisfaction with the operation and neurotic postoperative behavior (Ziegler, Rodgers, and Kriegsman, 1966).
The implication of this research is that the questionnaire form (or superficial interview) is too simple a procedure for the valid investigation of the complex pattern of response triggered by vasectomy.
Accordingly, in 1969, a study employing a refinement of the usual questionnaire survey technique was undertaken by one of us (Wolfers, 1970). In this study, no questions relating to psychological or sexual adjustment were asked on the questionnaire form which was circulated to a subsample of the same British population investigated by the Simon Population Trust Survey (1969) by the conventional postal questionnaire survey technique. Instead, respondents were asked to request an appointment with a visiting psychologist if they believed that they had encountered any marital or sexual problems as a result of their opera-

tion. By this variation in technique, the percentage of men who signalled psychosexual complications increased from 1.5% to 12%.
Prevailing conditions did not permit a repetition of this procedure in Malaysia. Instead, care was taken not to draw attention to our interest in psychosexual effects. We did not specify whether medical or psychological effects were implied by "fears," "regrets," or "ill-effects." Nonrestricted replies to these questions were solicited and categorized afterwards. Only one direct question on psychosexual effects was asked and positive replies to this question were followed-up with a depth interview.
The procedure lacks the motivational involvement of the respondent of the United Kingdom study, but emulates it in keeping the questions open-ended and reducing "leading" to a minimum.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
In this study, a sample of 246 men living on three rubber estates on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was interviewed one to four years after undergoing contraceptive vasectomy operations. The men are

officer, and of the 246 men 186 reported having first heard of vasectomy from a visiting health officer, 27 from the mass media, and 33 from other sources.
The aim of the investigation was to examine the incidence and nature of psychological and medical complications reported after the operation. This report deals only with the psychological effects; the medical aspects will be published separately. Four psychological variables were investigated; regret at having had the operation, fears arising out of the operation, loss of libido, and marital problems attributed by the patient to the operation. The interviews consisted of an individually administered verbal questionnaire form of 27 questions. These were carried out by University students of Indian origin in the native dialect of the interviewee. Respondents who reported psychosexual problems arising out of the operation were reinterviewed in depth by the Indian coauthor Dr. Subbiah a month after the initial interview.

Four couples in the entire study had no living daughter, and of these three expressed either fears or regrets. Not a single couple without at least one living sonwaspresent in thesample studied, tending to indicate that men without heirs will not apply for vasectomy in Malaysia.
Naturally enough, anxiety is also significantly associated with the presence of physical ill-effects (real or imagined). The responsibility for the decision to have the

detailed discussion of this question, see Wolfers and Wolfers, (1973).
WEAKNESS
Approximately 17fo of the men complained of general body weakness in this study. The depth interviews revealed a possible connection between this complaint and fantasies of absorption of sperm by the body, as described in a later section.
The experience of weakness recurs in most published Indian studies, but not in European and American studies. The Family Planning Association of India (1970) report on vasectomy in Bombay concluded, "the data seem to suggest that either the fact of having undergone this operation or the specific knowledge that this operation means cessation of fertility, is associated with the feeling of weakness or loss of strength" (p. 49). Some 40% said their health had deteriorated and 23% reported body weakness.
The report of body weakness also appears in other contraceptive studies in developing countries. In the Singapore I.U.D. program "weakness" is the reason given by 5% of women requesting removal of the device (D. Wolfers, 1970). Further research is

needed to clarify to what extent the acceptors of contraception in developing countries, who are often anemic and suffering from malnutrition, do actually suffer a deterioration in physical wellbeing from specific causes connected with the contraceptive procedure and to what extent this experience is psychological in nature.
REASONS FOR HAVING THE OPERATION
The reasons most commonly given for having the operation in this as in most Asian studies are "enough children" and "to avoid having more children" respectively, while in most Western studies it is given as "economic." There is evidence from other inquiries that in terms of income people struggling to bring up children with hopelessly inadequate material means are not primarily concerned with the added financial burden which more children present. It would seem that five undernourished children present much the same problem as ten. Analyzing reasons for acceptance (of the I.U.D. in Singapore) by parity, D. Wolfers (1970) found that "finance" as a reason increases with parity to five children amongst Chinese and Indians and to four amongst Malays and then declines without

320

interruption for all three ethnic groups as parity increases. On the other hand, "too many children" as a reason increases steadily with parity in all groups.
For purposes of motivating people to accept vasectomy, it may be important to differentiate these two reasons. Below some level of prosperity, economic considerations appear not to be the dominant ones in determining the point at which a family is considered large enough. Knowledge is lacking as regards the more precise factors involved in the concept, of "too many children" or "enough children." What are the salient factors to those responding in these terms? It does not, for instance, appear to refer to the effect on wife's health of repeated childbearing, for again, from D. Wolfers' (1970) figures, "health" as a reason for acceptance accounts for only 3 % to 4% of reasons given at the high parity levels (7+)» One may speculate that after prolonged experience of the ties of infant care it represents a desire for personal freedom. If so, we should perhaps direct our efforts to motivating people in developing countries towards this desire at an earlier stage in childbearing. Whatever the real meaning of "too many children," it obviously represents a too-long-delayed awakening.
SONS AND DAUGHTERS
It is well known that in most developing countries sons are still considered (and often still are) economic assets providing among other things security in old age and the fulfilling of social and religious obligations in nonnuclear-family societies. Kakar (1969) notes in a study of 100 vasectomized men that 94 had at least two living sons and only one had no sons. In the present study not one of a sample of 246 vasectomized men had no sons and 234 (95.1%) had at least 2 living sons. In all, there were exactly 1,000 sons and daughters,

117 males per 100 females. In the vasectomy study by Dandekar in India, (1963) this ratio was as high as 140 sons to 100 daughters.
Nonetheless, complete absence of daughters in the family appears to be a strong contraindication for vasectomy since three out of the four daughterless fathers in this study expressed fears or regrets after the operation (see Table 4).
DEATHS AND MISCARRIAGES
There is a suggestion that parents who have lost children may need specialized counseling, as higher proportions of those who had experienced this misfortune reported anxiety than those who had not. Neither age nor parity was significantly associated with the loss of children or miscarriages.
WHOSE DECISION TO HAVE THE OPERATION
Of the present sample, 125 men (51%) said the decision to have the operation was made jointly by husband and wife; 112 (46%) stated the decision to have been made separately either by husband or wife; 9 men (3%) gave other answers.
As far as we know, the only time a similar question has been asked in a developing country study was by Kakar (1969) who gives the proportion who obtained wife's consent (67%) before undergoing the operation. Unfortunately, no analysis was made by other variables except for marital harmony; 75% of those reporting decrease in marital harmony had not sought wife's consent.
In this study, this was the strongest predictor of postoperative anxiety. It would appear that this is a rare instance where bringing a question seemingly more relevant to an alien culture has resulted in a productive discovery, for this variable is the most powerful predictor of anxiety to emerge from this study and the question is
