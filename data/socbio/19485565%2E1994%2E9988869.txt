ABSTRACT: In this paper, we calculate a base line of statistical data on the frequency of sexual activity at various ages of Taiwanese women. A cross-sectional study using questionnaires administered during personal interviews was conducted on more than seventeen thousand women who attended family planning clinics in the Taipei metropolitan area in 1991 and 1992. Of the women surveyed, 2.8 per cent were sexually inactive in the previous month, 83.67 per cent had intercourse one to nine times in the previous month, and 13.56 per cent had intercourse ten times or more. The mean frequency of sexual activity was 6.8 times a month. Age-specific mean coital frequencies for the age groups of less than 25 years, of 25-34 years, and of 35-44 years were 10.3, 7.3, and 6.6 times per month, respectively. Increased sexual frequency was associated with the following factors: young age, unmarried, lower educational level, fewer years of marriage and being on the pill. When logistic regression was used to control for confounding variables, we found that a woman's age is the most significant factor in predicting her sexual frequency.

Sexual activity may be the most central of all human activities. It is also important to a number of medical and social issues (Smith, 1991), such as sexually transmitted diseases, abortion, contraception, reproductive problems, marital difficulties, and divorce. Information about sexual activity is essential for dealing with these issues, yet accurate information on means of women's sexual activity remains incomplete (Mulligan et al., 1991). Udry and Morris (1982) conducted a study on married American white women between the ages of 15 and 44 in 1974 and found a mean sexual frequency of 9.5 times per month. Data on Thai women (Udry et al., 1982), based on interviews conducted with a sample of 900 currently married women between the ages of 15 and 44 in an area just outside Bangkok in 1969, showed a mean sexual frequency of 6.4 times per month. In a Japanese study (Udry et al., 1982) conducted on 1,020 married female pa-

tients under the age of 45 at eight hospitals in Tokyo and Yokohama between 1975 and 1976 mean sexual frequency was 8.3 times per month. Unfortunately, data from the above three nations may not be applicable to older or unmarried women, because they are based only on married participants under the age of 45.
Since there had not been any systematic and scientific research on the sexual activity of women in Taiwan, our country has called for a base line, or standard data for the comparison of the sexual frequency of various ages of women. In order to acquire such data, a large scale cross-sectional survey was conducted in the metropolitan area of Taipei between 1991 and 1992. This paper attempts to provide information on the contemporary evaluation of sexual frequency among Taiwanese women as well as to delineate social and demographic characteristics related to differences in sexual frequency.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

RESULTS

The study used questionnaires administered during personal interviews with 17,047 consecutive women who visited family planning clinics at twelve local health centers in the metropolitan area of Taipei between July 1991 and December 1992. Contents of the questionnaire included demographic and social data, focusing especially on reproductive history and sexual behavior. The data on the frequency of intercourse were collected through a question which asked each woman to report how many times she and her sexual partner had intercourse in the previous month.
Women interviewed ranged from 16 to 92 years with an average age of 35.24 years. Of the 17,047 women, 15,249 were married, 1,108 were unmarried, 298 were widowed, and 392 were divorced or separated.
Interviewers were public health nurses at the twelve local health centers in the Taipei area who received a minimum of eight hours of training about the data collection and interviewing techniques. One of the authors (Wang) supervised the work to ensure the consistency of the interviews.
Using a SAS package, we analyzed how sexual frequency varied with social and demographic characteristics. The major factors included in the analysis were age, ethnicity, current marital status, duration of marriage, and contraceptive methods. By logistic regression, we controlled for confounding variables and determined which factors were important in explaining sexual frequency. In addition, we used the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test for trends, when applicable.

Table 1 shows sexual frequency during the one month prior to the interview. The mean number of acts was 6.8. Among the women interviewed, 2.8 per cent were sexually inactive; 83.64 per cent had intercourse 1 to 9 times in the previous month; and 13.56 per cent had intercourse 10 times or more in the previous month. As was expected, sexual frequency varied in direct relation to age. For example, women who had intercourse once or more during the previous month segmented by age as follows: under 25 years old, 99.65 per cent; ages 35-39, 98.94 per cent; ages 45-49, 94.75 per cent; ages 55-59, 68.15 per cent; ages 60-64, 58.6 per cent; and ages 65 and over, 40 per cent.
A more marked difference in sexual activity between different age groups is apparent for those having intercourse 10 times or more during the month: under 25 years old, 38.02 per cent; ages 35-39,10.47 per cent; ages 50-54,5.55 per cent. While the per cent is practically nil for 10 times a month for women aged 65 and older, 40 per cent of women in the 65 and older age group were still having intercourse, although at varying frequencies.
By 45-49 years of age, about 5 per cent of women had become sexually inactive, and by ages 50-54, 12.21 per cent were inactive. This proportion rose to 31.85 per cent in women 55-59 years old, and to 41.40 per cent in women 60-64 years old. About 60 per cent of women more than 65 years old had no sexual activity. Both the differences and the trends were significant at P< 0.0001.

reported a slightly higher sexual frequency than women in urban areas, on average, but this relationship is not significant. There was also not any difference in sexual frequency by ethnicity.
In this study population, 64.55 per cent of widowed women were sexually inactive, as were 21.28 per cent of divorced or separated women. Women who had intercourse ten or more times in the previous month represented only 9.88 per cent of married women, but 54.15 per cent of unmarried women and 38.91 per cent of separated or divorced women. The percentage of women who had coitus frequently was actually higher among unmarried women than among married women. However, a far higher percentage of married women (88.18 per cent) than of unmarried women (35.47) had sexual intercourse 1-9 times in the previous month. Few married women had been abstinent (1.94 per cent). The difference was significant at P < 0.0001.
Education level was also related to coital frequency. Few women in the "college & over" group had been sexually inactive (1.14 per cent). In fact, a very high percentage of the "college & over" group (89.36 per cent) had sexual intercourse 1-9 times. The difference is significant at P< 0.0001.
Within our survey, occupational status had little apparent bearing on sexual activity. Employed and unemployed women participated in coitus to a comparable degree. However, no clerical workers had been abstinent during this period, and a much higher percentage of clerical workers (14.08 per cent) had coitus 10 or more times. The difference is significant at P<0.01. This finding may be due in

part to our study with a sample of 17,047 women, where small differences in coital frequency are statistically significant.
There is a fairly regular decline in the frequency of intercourse by the duration of marriage, from 7.8 acts per month among those in the first year of marriage to 3.7 acts among those married for more than 26 years. Both these differences and trends are significant ( P < 0.0001).
It will be noted that average coital frequency is associated with the contraceptive method. The highest frequencies are reported by women who are using the pill or sterilization method, whereas the lowest frequencies are associated with the use of the rhythm method ( P < 0.0001).
Table 2 presents the logistic regression analysis, which indicates that women's age, marital status, years of marriage, educational attainment, and contraceptive method all independently affect the frequency of intercourse. In particular, women's age is the most important contributor to the decline in frequency of intercourse (P< 0.0001).
DISCUSSION
Our data show that, on average, women under the age of 45 reported engaging in sexual intercourse 7.2 times in the preceding month, and that the age-specific mean frequencies for the age groups of 25 years and younger, 25 to 34 years, and 35 to 44 years were 10.3, 7.3, and 6.6 times per month, respectively. These agespecific mean frequencies are moderate figures when compared with those

in other countries (Table 3). However, the overall mean frequency of 7.2 times per month is far lower than in other countries and corresponds most closely to Thailand's data set.

As expected, we found a sharp decline in female sexual frequency with age, even when other confounding factors are controlled for. However, it is impossible to separate out aging

effects and cohort effects absolutely. It is well established that sexual frequency roughly halves between the ages of 20 and 40. The decline has been attributed by Kinsey et al. (1953) to waning physiological capacity, and this view was also supported by Runciman (1981), Udry et al. (1978), and Udry (1980). However this point has been challenged by Persky et al. (1978) who reported that sexual frequency correlates with women's testosterone level. This idea was disputed by James (1981) and Gartrell et al. (1977), who suggested that sexual frequency approximately halves during the first year of marriage and then takes perhaps another 20 years to halve again. They claimed that such a decline seems unlikely to reflect a biologically based decline in hormone levels.
On the other hand, culture plays an important role in shaping sexual frequency in two ways. First, marital status always affects a person's frequency of sexual intercourse. Second, social conventions and accepted practices have changed during recent generations. This change in behavior has been accompanied by increased social acceptance of premarital sex (Greeley et al., 1990; Niem et al., 1989; Smith, 1990). Also, the general literature on the "sexual revolution" (Cannon and Long, 1971; Chilan, 1978; Clayton and Bokemeier, 1980) suggests that since sexual behavior grew more permissive over time, women of a younger cohort are more sexually active than older cohorts were at the same age. These social behavior studies, when combined with the biological and hormonal studies reviewed above, suggest that any interpretation of the decline in sexual

frequency with age must be taken with caution. However, we believe that the most probable explanation is a combination of sociological processes interacting with biological processes to produce the observed patterns.
Coital frequency was also found to be higher among women with less educational attainment and among those who are likely to want considerably more children. In contrast, the cause of the apparent decline among those whose educational attainment was college or more was that they intended to have no more children (Westoff, 1974). These results remained relatively unaffected when we adjusted for age. In addition, it is often presumed that women who are engaged in "physical occupations" indulge in sexual activity more frequently than women who have "clerical" occupations (Finkle et al., 1959). Our data do not support this assumption. Clerical workers had a maximal frequency of 7.3 times monthly.
A factor which might influence coital frequency is the amount of interference with sexual intercourse that the method of contraception causes. A classification system for contraception employed by Gough (1973) was whether the method was coitusindependent (the pill, IUD, sterilization), coitus-dependent (condom), or coitus-inhibiting (rhythm, withdrawal). This classification produced some illuminating results. The highest frequencies occurred in pill users (9.4 acts), and the lowest frequencies in rhythm users (5.8 acts). Users of coitus-independent methods reported higher-than-average coital frequencies with the single exception of users of IUD's who reported a lower coital

frequency (6.3 acts). This finding isinfluenced by the fact that Taiwanese women electing the IUD method tended to be in the older, married group (Wang, ms.).
