In their already classic family study of mental retardation, Elizabeth and Sheldon Reed (196S) found 1,866 couples where IQ scores were available for both man and woman. In 132 of these unions the two scores differed by 31 points or more, with the difference favoring the woman in 90 cases and the man in only 42 cases. A chisquare test showed that these frequencies differed decisively from equality, that is, 66 cases in each direction {p <. 0.001). The result prompted the Reeds to make "a detailed analysis of the 132 nonassortative matings to see if any difference could be detected between the 90 women who "married down" and the 42 women who married "up."
The mean IQ for the 90 women who married down was 122.2, that for their spouses was 81.3. The mean IQ of the 42 girls who married up was 81.2, that for their spouses was 122.6. There was no significant difference between the two groups of women other than in average IQ score. Their educational status was the same, 11.8 years of schooling for those marrying down versus 11.4 years of schooling for those marrying up. Did early pregnancy force the high IQ girls into early and unsuitable marriages? No, the mean age at birth of first child for the high females was 22.3 years, for the low females, 22.0 years. Did the high female spouses

marry men like their fathers? Apparently not any more than the low IQ girls did. The occupations of most of the males in this group ranged around semiskilled and skilled categories so that meaningful comparisons could not be made. (Reed and Reed, 1965, p. 58).
At this point, the Reeds shifted to another, though closely related, question. In view of the substantial degree of homogamy for IQ in their data (the marital correlation was -f-0.326), what accounted for the nonassortative marriages in general? The Reeds concluded that the chief reason was "the poor education of the high IQ spouses." "It is clear," they write, "that poor socioeconomic status prevented the appropriate education and marriages of a number of individuals of unusually high intelligence" (p. 59). This conclusion may well be true but it leaves the direction of difference in nonassortative marriages unexplained. We still don't know why the woman had the higher IQ in roughly two thirds of the nonassortative marriages.
"It occurred to us," the Reeds continue, "that there might be twice as many women with high IQs as men, which would explain why so many girls 'married down' in terms of intelligence ratings" (p. 59). The Reeds

then report an average IQ for the 1,866 husbands of 100.7 and for the 1,866 wives of 103.5. They conclude by noting that "while the consistent superiority of women over men is obvious, there is no appreciable excess of gifted girls over boys that would account for their 'marrying down.' We cannot think of any explanation for this statistically significant marrying down process that is presumably of sociological origin" (p. 59).
This conclusion by the Reeds is unnecessarily despairing. The marrying down process has a simple explanation, requiring no data not presented by the Reeds themselves. The explanation rests on the fact that small differences in mean IQ can produce large differences in the direction of sexual dominance in highly nonassortative marriages. Given the mean difference of 2.8 IQ points between the sexes, what is the probability that a woman's IQ will exceed her husband's by 31 points or more? What is the probability that the man's IQ will exceed his wife's by 31 points or more? Plainly, the first probability is larger than the second since, on the average, the wife has a small advantage over her husband by reason of sex. But is this small difference in average IQ sufficient to account for the much more impressive two-to-one ratio of women marrying down over women marrying up?
In a normal bivariate population, as we may suppose the IQ's of husband and wife to be, at least approximately, the algebraic difference between the IQ's of man and woman is itself normally distributed with a mean equal to the mean difference, in this case, 2.8 points, and a standard deviation equal to
<%« = (om2 4-tf«o2-- 2rmwamaw)i.
The Reeds report standard errors of the mean equal to 0.36 and 0.33 for the men

and women respectively. Therefore, the standard deviations

cm= 15.55 < V = 14.26 and

= 17.34.

Now, the probability that the woman's IQ will exceed her husband's by 31 points or more is

/ 31 -- 2.8 \

p[[Vzz ^

I = 00..0520,

while the probability that the man's IQ

will exceed his wife's by 31 points or more

is

p[g>--_

=o0.i.0256.

In a sample of 1,866 pairs we should

find 97.3 women marrying down and 47.3

women marrying up. Both of these figures are somewhat higher than the observed frequencies, that is, there are fewer nonassortative unions in general than would be expected from an analysis based on the normal bivariate distribution. We may conclude that the distribution of differences is slightly

leptokurtic. The main point, however, is that the ratio of women marrying down to women marrying up is essentially the same in theory as in practice, 2.06 versus 2.14. The answer, therefore, to our question is yes. The 2.8 mean difference between the sexes is quite enough to generate the two-

to-one difference in direction of sexual dominance in assortative marriages. In fact, if the marital correlation were higher than it is the ratio could easily be more extreme.

Several investigators (Burt and Howard, 1956; Alstrom, 1961; Spuhler, 1962) have reported marital correlations higher than

the value of +0.326 obtained by the Reeds.

The most likely reason for this discrepancy is that the Reeds drew their data from the last three or four generations, whereas the other investigators worked with the current generation only. Since homogamy for IQ seems to be increasing as sodoeconomic position becomes more and more dependent on school success, the Reeds' use of data from earlier generations would be expected to lower the marital correlation.
In any case, suppose the marital correlation were +0.50 instead of +0.326. The ratio of women marrying down to women marrying up would then be 2.5 to 1. If the marital correlation were higher yet, even more extreme ratios could be obtained, still using the same cutoff of 31 points or more. Increasing this cutoff is another way we might increase the dominance of the women in nonassortative unions. Using a cutoff of 41 points or more, for example, would increase the ratio to 2.4 to 1.
In practice, these considerations mean that there is no point in looking for sociological differences between women marrying

up and women marrying down. As long as the mean difference between the sexes exists, the directional disproportion will continue. As for the mean difference itself, it is a large and complicated question in its own right. Terman's 1937 Revision of the Stanford-Binet and most IQ tests built or revised since then have been constructed to minimize sex differences. These efforts, however, have not been entirely successful and it could be, as the Reeds say (p. 59), that "femininity is not only condudve to longer life, but also to higher intelligence as it is measured by the IQ test." Another possibility lies in the small percentages of men and women who never marry. Since the observed difference concerns husbands and wives, it could have its origins in marital selection. In any case, the reasons are not directly relevant. Once we know that a mean difference in favor of the women exists and what the marital correlation is, we also know that women tend to marry down more often than up in nonassortative marriages.
