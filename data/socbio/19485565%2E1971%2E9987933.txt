Demographers and sociologists continue to evidence an interest in relationships between socioeconomic indicators and fertility (Duncan, 1964; Goldstein and Mayer, 196S; Kunz, 1965; Mitra, 1966a, 19666, and 1966c; Blau and Duncan, 1967; for earlier review of the literature see United Nations, 19S3). While many of the earlier studies rely on correlations between fertility rates and the socioeconomic characteristics of areas to infer the relationship between socioeconomic characteristics and fertility rates of individual couples, more recent studies have been concerned with the interrelationship between status characteristics of individuals vis-à-vis those of areal units as they relate to fertility (Westoff et al., 1961, 1963; Duncan, 1964; Goldstein and Mayer, 1965).
Students of the complex relationships between fertility, age of wife, status indicators, and residence have called for a more refined study of these relationships in a variety of areas (Goldstein and Mayer, 1965, p. 309). This paper represents an extension of the work reported by Duncan

(1964, p. 88) which concludes "analyses in which areal classification is examined simultaneously with several individual classifications of socioeconomic characteristics suggest that areal differentiation in fertility may not be completely reducible to areal clustered effects of some conventional individual variables." Specifically, the paper is directed at the question, "Do levels of income and education in the census tracts where couples reside add to explained variance in fertility of couples which is explained by individual characteristics like education of wife and/or income of husband?" An early study of fertility by type of residence suggests that some relationship may exist between house type and fertility (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1948, Table 13; Westoff et al., 1961, p. 272-273; Westoff, Potter, and Sagi, 1963, p. 160). The relationships between fertility and wife's education or husband's income have been reported in various studies (Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell, 1959, p. 288-302; Westoff et al., 1961, p. 323; Westoff et al., 1963, p. 217;

Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966, p. 96, 103, 104). Fertility level of tract is also considered.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The study is concerned with comparing the relationship between fertility and individual and/or census-tract characteristics. The dependent variable is measured in two ways: number of children under age five per woman ( F i ) , and number of children ever born per woman ( F 2 ) . The independent variables are: (Xi) wife's education--number of years of school completed; (X2) husband's income--annual income in thousands of dollars; (X3) tract education --per cent of persons age 25 and over in tract (where couple resides) who completed high school; (Xj) tract income--median income of the tract where the couple resides; (X$) tract fertility--child-woman ratio in the tract where the couple resides. Age of wife is a control variable (Westoff et al., 1961, p. 282-287; Westoff et al., 1963, p. 199-200).
Data for this study are taken from a larger study of fertility and occupational mobility by Otis Dudley Duncan ("Differential Fertility and Social Mobility," supported by research grant no. GM10386, U.S. Public Health Service, 1962). These data were collected by the U.S. Bureau of the Census as part of the March, 1962, Current Population Survey (Blau and Duncan, 1967, p. 10-19) and supplied in the form of tables because the basic data source is held confidential by the Bureau. The analysis is limited to white, married couples living in the twelve largest Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas of the United States.
These couples were coded according to three characteristics (cited above) of the census tracts where they reside. Limitations of time and resources prevented computa-

tion of within-tract variances, gathering information on additional characteristics or obtaining similar information for other categories of couples not included in this study. Cross-tabulations giving number of children per wife by individual and tract characteristics for first-order relationships were obtained from the Bureau of the Census. Wives were divided into four age groups: 22-26; 27-31; 32-36; 37-41. These unorthodox intervals were not specified according to needs of the limited analysis presented here; rather they were intended to permit intracohort comparisons with data from the 1960 census (which is beyond the scope of the present study).
Both linear and curvilinear regression techniques were attempted. However, the analysis assumes that the relationships are linear for a number of reasons. One is that the confidence bands about the regression lines are wide because the overall sampling fraction is small, and corrections are added which increase the width since it is impossible to accurately estimate variances in subgroups on the basis of information supplied by the Bureau of the Census.
Attempts to fit second degree parabolas were made, but addition of the squared term did not make much contribution to explained variance. Although F tests are accomplished to evaluate the additional reduction in total sum of squares due to the addition of one or more independent variables in the regression problems, the results of such tests should be interpreted with great caution since the sample is not a simple random one but an areal clustered sample (Blau and Duncan, 1967, p. 18). Hence, levels of statistical significance reported in the tables only provide crude, "rule-of-thumb" estimates (the tests were accomplished by underestimating sample N's and acting as if the sample were a simple random one). A brief summary of results follows.

RESULTS
Zero-order relationships. The results from the simple correlation analysis are consistent with those of previous studies (see Tables 1 and 2). Looking at relationships between fertility and individual characteristics, one sees that there is a significant negative relationship between children ever born/wife and wife's education. The relationship does not hold for number of children under age five/wife for older age groups. Women in these age groups are less likely to have children under age five. There is little relationship between the measures of fertility and husband's (rather than family's) income which is consistent with the findings of previous studies of

fertility patterns for whites (Freedman et al., 19S9, p. 293,29o).1
It is apparent that characteristics of tracts show less relation to fertility of individual women as the age of wife advances. This seems reasonable given the expectation that births are more likely to occur early rather than late in the childbearing period and the likelihood that a family will have
1 A check on the reliability of the regression analyses for children ever born by wife's education or husband's income was accomplished by using the Bureau of the Census 1/1,000 computer tape to produce tabulations roughly comparable to those used here: white married couples (spouse present) living in cities over 1,000,000 in size. The intercepts, regression, and correlation coefficients were sufficiently similar that one would not be badly misled by substituting one set for the other. Unfortunately the 1/1,000 data tape contained no information on tracts.

their previous place of résidence and their current place of residence.
Subsequent analysis is restricted to white married couples with wives in the youngest age group. Looking at the left half of Table 1, it is apparent that the fertility of young wives is more closely correlated with the fertility level of the tract in which they

reside than either wife's education or husband's income. This observation probably reflects residential segregation by fertility behavior and stage in the life cycle. The results are somewhat different where number of children ever born is the dependent variable (right-hand part of Table 1). Wife's education and educational level of

302

tract are somewhat more closely related to this measure of fertility than tract fertility. Tract income is less closely associated with either measure of fertility.
Multivariate analyses. Beta and multiple regression coefficients were computed for all regressions of possible combinations of independent variables on the two measures of fertility2 (see Table 3 ) . F tests were accomplished as a crude indication of the explanation gained by the addition of each variable to the remaining variables in each regression equation. In the case of children under age five per woman, the relationships with independent variables are not independent of one another, except for tract fertility which makes a robust contribution to variance in fertility. Tract income has little effect on fertility, while tract education has slightly greater effect, particularly in those equations which exclude one or more of the other tract characteristics. Although the contribution of husband's income is modest, it is partially independent of the effects of other variables.
The net regression coefficients for children ever born on these same variables show change in their relative importance (bottom half of Table 3). Wife's education is most closely associated with this fertility measure, with tract fertility and tract education also making substantial independent contributions to the explanation. (However, the effect of tract education is greater when wife's education is not included in the estimating equation.)
2 Also, cross-tabulations giving number of children per wife by individual and tract characteristics for first-order relationships were obtained from the Bureau of the Census for women in the four age groups. These first-order tabulations were used to see if there might be a possible interaction between an individual characteristic (e.g., wife's education) and a tract characteristic (e.g., level of education in the tract of residence) beyond their additive effect on fertility. Tests for interaction support the notion that effects of the independent variables are additive on both measures of fertility.

Neither husband's income nor tract income make much of a contribution.
One must acknowledge that none of the net coefficients are particularly large; but one would hardly expect to explain much of the variance given the variables employed in the table. Nevertheless, the four variables in combination account for almost a quarter of the variation in number of children ever born (see bottom right comer of Table 3).
Tract versus individual characteristics. Another way of looking at the data in Table 3 is to focus on which tract characteristic adds the most to individual characteristics in explaining variation in the child/woman ratios. It is easily seen that tract fertility makes the greatest independent contribution to variation in number of children under age five (Fi) when added to regressions of wife's education and/or husband's income (compare r V i = --0.0204, r V s = 0.0097, and rzY.12 = .0439 with appropriate R2's in top of Table 3). The results are similar when the dependent variable is number of children ever born (F2) (Comparerai r= --0.1457, r V 2 = --0.0015, and r2Y.12 = 0.1635 with appropriate .R2's in bottom half of Table 3). However, tract education adds somewhat more than tract fertility in regressions which exclude wife's education. Note that the combination of wife's education with tract education and tract fertility (or just tract fertility) accounts for nearly all of the explained variation in number of children ever born.
Those who might wish to substitute correlations of tract fertility ratios by tract levels of education and/or income as a substitute for (individual) correlations of parity by wife's education or husband's income would take little comfort from results of this study. In the case of fertility by education the individual correlations are stronger than the areal unit correlations

while the reverse is true in the case of fertility by income.3
DISCUSSION
These results give a partial answer to the question of whether or not characteristics of areal units add anything to characteristics of individuals or families in predicting fertility. The analysis has shown that the levels of education and fertility in census tracts in which white married couples reside make a contribution to explained variation in fertility which is independent of the couples' socioeconomic status as indicated by wife's education or husband's income. Both individual and tract characteristics carry less weight in the estimating equations for fertility of wives in the older age groups.
Given the cross-sectional design, the data are insufficient to support hypotheses concerning causal sequences. Although wife's education would usually precede choice of neighborhood (tract in this case), numerous other factors affect residential choice, one of which would be the birth of children. Since various types and prices of housing
3 The necessary data for two-variable relationships can be gleaned from Tables 1 and 2. Tract education and tract income together account for more of the variance in tract fertility than couple education and income account for variance in parity. The R2 for Y1 · X1X2 in the four age groups youngest to oldest are 0.0439, 0.0094, 0.0000, and 0.0041; for Y2 · X1X2 they are 0.1635, 0.0476, 0.0214, and 0.0069. These are compared with R2 for X5 · X3X4 which are 0.2185, 0.2798, 0.3375, and 0.2556.

are segregated, it seems likely that the correlations and regressions reported in this study reflect tract selectivity of persons at various levels of education or couples at various stages of the family life cycle. Presumably, the dormitory-type suburb attracts persons with one or more children while the area of small luxury apartments attracts singles or couples with no children. However, one would like to know whether the relationships noted above are entirely the product of tract selectivity (residential segregation by stage of the life cycle and size of family) or if there is some milieu effect which cannot be identified in this limited study. Would living in an area where all couples have large numbers of children cause a couple to have more children? The results of this study only hint at the answer. Tract characteristics give a more accurate estimate of number of children ever born per wife than of children under age five per wife. Since the latter is a better indicator of current fertility, the segregation hypothesis receives greater support than the normative (neighborhood climate) hypothesis. Further study is needed to test the merits of these alternative explanations.
