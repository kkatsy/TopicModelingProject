ABSTRACT: A regression model expressing the age-specific fertility rates at a given point of time as a variable dependent upon the same at the preceding points of time has been developed by Das Gupta for purposes of fertility projection. The model, judged by the values of the multiple correlation coefficients, appears to work very well with the U.S. data set, and it also produces limiting values of the fertility rates when the projection is carried far into the future. The conditions of convergence of such a model have been determined in this paper according to which the model's usefulness for purposes of long-term projection of fertility rates appears to be severely restricted.

In a very interesting paper, Das Gupta (1989) has presented a multiple regression model to project agespecific fertility rates at time t from the same at preceding time periods. Using different notations his model can be expressed as
fait) = BOa + BuF(t~\)
10

+ B3ay\ifa+i(t-l)+fa+i(t-2)
(1) where fa{t) is the age-specific rate at age a in year t and

f(t--\) = ^jfa{t-- 1)
a

(2)

is the total fertility rate in year t-\. The

multiple correlations for all ages were

found to be quite high ranging from a

minimum of 0.845 at age 49 to a max-

imum of 0.999 at all three ages, 41,42,

and 43. In fact, out of a total of thirty-

six multiple correlations computed for

every single year of age in the age interval (14,49) all but five were greater than 0.99. One of the interesting results that emerges out of the empirical investigation of this model is that the age-specific fertility rates and other functions based on them stabilize after reasonable lengths of time. Das Gupta (1989, p. 267) has noted that "More research is needed to decide how many independent variables should be used in the multiple linear regressions and what should be their precise definitions. . . . A prudent choice of the variables in the multiple regressions should lead to convergence of the age-specific fertility rates to some stable values, although this cannot be proved mathematically."
The purpose of this note is first to show that the convergence or lack of it can be established in a straightforward manner when the coefficient of Bla, i.e., the total fertility rate is the sole independent variable in (1). Second, under certain simplifying but realistic assumptions the same conclusion can

also be drawn, when additional variables, in the form of linear functions of the age-specific fertility rates, like those in (1), are included in the model. These will be dealt with separately in the next two sections.

because, as n--*», B"--*0. The convergence of F(t) assures the
convergence of fa(t) since these two are linearly related (See Eq. 3).

CONVERGENCE WITH ONE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE

Let us begin by writing the linear model as

/,,(') =

(3)

where the total fertility is the only independent variable. Summing both sides of (3) over a, we get

F(t) = Bo where

Bo --
and

(5)

(6)
The recurrence relationship in (4) can be used to write the following for

as = Bo + Bt F(0)
F(2) = Bo + B, ( )
BQ + B0Bt + B\ F(0)

(7) (8)

and so on. The general expression for t = n, (n > 0), can be written as
F(n) = BO(1+ B1 + B? + --
+ BY1) + BfFiO). (9)

It is easy to see that only when

(9) converges to

CONVERGENCE WITH MORE THAN ONE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE

We begin the proof by first writing

(12)

where m(a) is some sort of an average of the ratio of the age-specific fertility rate to the total fertility rate. The average may be based on the time span covered by the model Equation (1) which in Das Gupta's example is 38 years. The variable ba(t) is a measure of the deviation of the rate in year t from the average m(a) where the latter is independent of t. We can expect that 8a(/) assumes only small values positive as well as negative. Its expected value for any a and any t can be taken as zero.
Observe that the substitution of (12) in (1) produces another expression of the identity in the form of

/fl(0'= 0
+ C1OflF(M0) + E

(13)

where the C's are linear compounds of the m's and £ is a linear compound of 5's with weights proportional to Fs. Now we introduce our simplifying assumption that a linear function of a large number of these ba{t) with unrelated weights can be assumed to be equal to zero. Therefore,

£· = 0

(14)

which makes fa(t) a linear compound

of F(t)s with known coefficients. Next, summing (13) over age a, we
get

F(t) = Co +dF(M) + C2F(t-2) +

The solution of (15) can be obtained by the application of the principles of the generating function or of those of the mathematics of stable population. In the following, we have used the latter approach by first writing (15) in terms of its continuous form as

F(t) = Co + §TMF{t-u)C[u)du (17)
Equation (17) differs from the traditional Lotka's integral equation due to the presence of the constant Co. A similar equation appeared earlier in a different context (Mitra), and it was solved by differentiating (17) with respect to t under the standard assumption of continuity and differentiability of F[t). That operation reduces (17) to the standard form of Lotka's integral equation as

F'(t) =

(18)

where we make the additional assumption that the differentiation can be carried under the integral sign.
As is well known, the limiting value of the solution (Keyfitz, 1968) of the integral equation (18) is

lim r-*=

F'(t)

= Qe*

(19)

in which Q and w are constants. Also w < = > 0 according as

P = [wC(u)du< = > 1.
(20)

It may be noted that w can be compared with the intrinsic rate of growth and P with the net reproduction rate of the traditional stable population model. Accordingly, the convergence of (15) and therefore of (13) is guaranteed only when w<0 or P< 1. In that case,

= 0 (21)

due to (19) and, therefore,

Mm (22)

where K is a constant. Substitution of (22) in (17) produces the following for the limiting value of Fit) as

K = Co + KP

(23)

where P is given by (20).
Since Co and P are known, the limiting value of F(t) is now known as

(24)

from (23) and the same of fa(t) as

fa(t) -

Co 10

(25)

by the substitution of (24) in (13). Similarly, the parameters which are linear compounds of fa(i) can be shown to have their respective limiting values.
In conclusion, it may be noted that the regression model will produce a limiting value of F(t) only when w < 0 or P < 1. Further, when w =0 or P = 1, Fit) will keep on increasing linearly, and its pattern of growth will be exponential when w > 0 or P > 1. This may be verified for large t (Mitra, 1983) by following the steps similar to those outlined in (21) and thereafter.

DISCUSSION
Since the shape of the trajectory of F(t) and therefore of f(a,t), is completely determined by the value of P, it follows from (20) that the convergence of the trajectory to a limiting value is by no means guaranteed in any projection exercise. Fortunately, the model converges in Das Gupta's example with the U.S. data. It is also possible that in the same example the model may still converge to different limiting

values when the number of terms on the right hand side of (1) is changed. In that case, the different trajectories obtained in the process can be used for generating alternative sets of population projection. However, as has been shown in this paper, the model's usefulness for purposes of long-term population projection remains in doubt due to the severity of the restriction implied by the condition of its convergence.
