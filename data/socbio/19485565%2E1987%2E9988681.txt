sociated with early onset of ovulatory cycles. The times from menarche until 50 per cent of the cycles were ovulatory were about 1 year, 3 years, and 4.5 years, when the ages at menarche were less than 12.0 years, 12.0-12.9 years, and more than or equal to 13.0 years, respectively. These authors also found that Quetelet's index of adiposity was highest in the early maturing group.

Second, the equation given by Foster et al. in Footnote e in Table 1 does not quantify fat and is not the fatness index of Frisch et al., 1973. The fatness index described in Frisch et al, 1973, and later papers (Frisch and McArthur, 1974; Frisch, 1980; Frisch, 1985) is total water as per cent of body weight (TW/ BWt%). Fat/body weight per cent is inverse to TW/BWt% since fat has little

It would be interesting to know why the Bangladesh data differ from the definitive data of Apter and Vihko (1983) and the earlier data of Halewijn

al. cite. In any case, the data from Bangladesh are puzzling, and their use in fertility models is problematic.
Also, two corrections are necessary on the use of the fatness index in the

(kg). (4) Fat/Body weight per cent = 100-
[(TBW/BWt %)/0.72].
These equations give physiologically meaningful numbers, which can be checked with corpse dissections and other direct body composition measure-

ments (Frisch, 1980; Frisch, 1985). It should be noted that prediction of the threshold body weight for height for menarche andregular cycles (Frischand McArthur, 1974), which is now widely used clinically to evaluate and treat nutritional amenorrhea (Nillius, 1983), is from TW/BWt%, not fat/body weight percent, (Frisch, 1985).
