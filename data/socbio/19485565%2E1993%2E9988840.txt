ABSTRACT: The 1986 experimental Demographic and Health Survey in the Dominican Republic was one of the first retrospective, population-based surveys of a developing country to collect information on prematurity status as well as birthweight. We show that the relationships among birthweight, prematurity status, and infant mortality are consistent with corresponding patterns observed in other Latin American and Caribbean countries and in developed nations. Two notable irregularities in the birthweight data are the atypically high proportion of infants weighing 4,000 grams or more, and the high mortality rates among infants with missing birthweight. Problems with the prematurity status data include an unexpectedly low proportion of premature births, an unusually small proportion of low birthweight explained by premature births, and an extremely high neonatal death rate among premature compared to term infants. Inclusion of an explicit definition of "premature" may help avert similar problems in future health surveys.

Birthweight and gestational age are well-known indicators of an infant's health at birth and are highly predictive of morbidity and mortality in the first few months of life (Thomson, 1983; Luchenco et al., 1972; McCormick, 1985). Most studies of the relations among birthweight, gestational age, and infant mortality have been based on data from vital registration sources in developed countries. Opportunities to study these relations in developing countries have been fairly limited, however, because data on birthweight and gestation length are rarely available for national samples in these populations.
Several studies of birthweight and infant mortality in developing countries have been based on birthweight information that was collected at the time of birth (Puffer and Serrano, 1987; Villar and Belizan, 1982; Mar-

torell and Gonzalez-Cossfo, 1987). A major disadvantage of each of these analyses is that the data were collected from a small number of hospitals which may not be representative of all births in the national target population. Studies of prematurity in developing countries are even less common and are subject to similar types of selections biases (Villar and Belizan, 1982; Martorell and Gonzalez-Cossio, 1987).
In order to obtain national-level information on these important indicators of health at birth, several recent surveys in developing countries have included questions on birthweight. The resulting evaluations of the usefulness of the information offer mixed findings. A study of birthweight data from the Malaysian Family Life Survey concluded that retrospectively recalled data provided worthwhile information on birthweight patterns in spite of

missing information and response error (DaVanzo et al., 1984). An analysis of data from the Demographic and Health Survey in Peru demonstrated that data on birthweight appeared to be internally consistent, but that the high nonresponse rate to the birthweight question led to biases in the estimated incidence of low birthweight and in the estimated relations among birthweight, mortality, and their sociodemographic correlates (Moreno and Goldman, 1990).
Our study analyses data on birthweight and prematurity status from a recent survey in the Dominican Republic. The principal objective is to assess whether retrospectively recalled data on these variables are accurate indicators of what they are intended to measure. We evaluate the data by examining distributions of birthweight and prematurity status and patterns of mortality by these two variables, and by comparing the resulting estimates with available data from other sources, including other sample surveys in developing countries, vital registration, and clinical studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data for this analysis are from the experimental questionnaire of the 1986 Dominican Republic Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The general objective of this survey was to resolve a number of methodological issues in survey research in connection with the measurement of fertility, contraception, child health, and child mortality by using an "experimental" questionnaire in conjunction with the standard questionnaire previously developed for the Demographic

and Health Survey program (Westoff et al., 1990). The DHS program has conducted national health surveys using the standard questionnaire in more than three dozen developing countries since the mid-1980's. The main innovation of the experimental questionnaire was the inclusion of a six-year monthly calendar that collected information on pregnancies, contraceptive use, postpartum behavior, marriage, residence, and employment information. An additional feature of the experimental questionnaire was the inclusion of questions on birthweight and prematurity status that were not part of the standard questionnaire.
A national stratified sample of about 12,000 Dominican women aged 15-49 was selected, approximately two-thirds of whom received the standard questionnaire and one-third (A/ = 3,885) the experimental questionnaire. Since most fertility, mortality, and health-related information was obtained only for births in 1981 or later, the sample used in this analysis consists of the 2,714 singleton, live births between January 1981 and December, 1986).
Unless otherwise noted, the numbers cited here are based on the unweighted sample. However, for the figures to be nationally representative of the Dominican Republic, they must be weighted according to the weights calculated as part of the sampling design.1 Details of the sampling design are given in Consejo Nacional de Pobla-
1A two-stage stratified cluster design wasused to obtain a self-weighted sample within each of the country's eight administrative health regions. Each region was also stratified by urban and rural areas. As a consequence, weights must be used to calculate national-level estimates.

cion y Familia, (1987). We use weighted statistics when comparing rates from the Dominican Republic with those from other countries, but not for the purposes of assessing the internal consistency of the data. Where weighted statistics are cited, we also provide the unweighted figures for comparison.
Mothers were asked to recall the birthweight of their infants in pounds and ounces. We have converted birthweight into grams in order to facilitate comparison with other studies. A total of 10.2 per cent of births lack a reported numerical birthweight. Information on prematurity status was collected with the question: "When [your baby] was born, was he/she ontime or premature?" Unfortunately, no specific gestation length was used to explain what was meant by "premature."
Duration of gestation is evaluated during prenatal care in the Dominican Republic by measuring uterine height (Hay, 1988). Although nearly 95 per cent of births in our sample were to women who received prenatal care from a physician or trained nurse, we do not know whether they were informed of their infants' gestational age at the time of the birth. As a consequence, we term the mother's report of prematurity status "subjective" to distinguish it from gestational ages known to be based on standard means of assessment and recorded on medical records or in a vital registration system. The standard WHO definition of premature (or preterm) birth refers to a gestation length of less than 37 completed weeks since last menstrual period. A subjective assessment of prematurity status was available for all but one infant in the Dominican Republic

sample. Since gestational age is more difficult to assess than birthweight, it seems unlikely that this near-complete reporting of prematurity status is a reflection of accuracy.
RESULTS
BIRTHWEIGHT
The birthweight distribution (Table 1) exhibits the expected shape, with the modal weight category (3,0003,499 grams) accounting for roughly one-third of all births, and few births weighing less than 1,500 grams. However, the proportion of births with reported weights of 4,000 grams or more (95% confidence interval = 12.2% ± 1.2; 12.9% unweighted) is higher than that reported for Mexico (2.8% ± 0.7), Brazil (4.6%), Costa Rica (5.4%) (Puffer and Serrano, 1987), and Malaysia (8.0% ±1.1) (Moreno and Goldman, 1990).2 Only Sweden (16.2%), New Zealand (12.2%) (WHO, 1978) and Peru (13.3% ± 1.8) (Westoff et al., 1990) exhibit proportions of births over 4,000 grams comparable to that in the Dominican Republic sample. We note that the figure for Peru is probably overstated, since lighter infants were under-represented among those with reported numerical birthweights (Westoff et al., 1990).
The estimated proportion of low birthweight (LBW) infants (weighing
2Sampling errors (and thus confidence intervals) cannot be calculated for some of the comparison countries because the statistics are based on the full population of births from a given year, rather than a sample. Sampling errors are given for estimates based on sample surveys only and are based on the assumption of simple random sampling. Because design effects are not taken into account, our estimates of the variance are probably too low.

This estimate is several percentage points below the estimate for Caribbean countries (13 per cent) calculated by Martorell and Gonzalez-Cossio (Martorell and Gonzalez-Cossio, 1987) based on data from the World Health Organization, although it is quite close to their estimate of 11 per cent LBW for all Latin American and Caribbean countries (Table 2).

3A birthweight of 5.5 pounds converts to 2,500 grams (rounded to the nearest 10 grams). In the Dominican Republic sample, 2.5 per cent of births were reported as weighing exactly 5.5 lbs., with fewer than 1per cent of births in the adjacent weight range (plus or minus one-half pound). This heaping is part of a commonly observed tendency to report birthweights that are multiples of .one-quarter or one-half pound or of 500 grams (David, 1980). Infants with reported weights of 5.5 lbs. are not included in the LBW estimate.

3,190 grams, respectively; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1986); the median for U.S. whites is 3,410 grams.
In accordance with expectations, the distributions of births across 500gram birthweight groups differ considerably by subjective prematurity status (Figure 1): Roughly half of premature infants are reported as weighing less than 2,500 grams, compared to only about 6 per cent of term births. Mean (weighted) birthweights for premature and term infants are 2,459 and 3,352 grams, respectively. Sixteen per cent of preterm births and 10.0 per cent of term births are missing information on birthweight. Based on the results of other studies that suggest an association between nonreporting of birthweight and incidence of LBW (Moreno and Goldman, 1990; David, 1980), it is likely that the true differences between the birthweight distributions for term and premature infants are even more pronounced than those shown in Figure 1.
In order to determine whether certain subgroups of women were less likely to report a birthweight, we estimated multivariate logistic models of having a reported birthweight (not shown). These analyses demonstrate that infants delivered without professional medical assistance were only about one-twentieth as likely to have a reported birthweight as those delivered by doctors or nurses. This finding suggests that many infants for whom birthweight is missing were likely never weighed (Miller et al., 1992).4 Less
4The extent to which mothers are able to report birthweight appears to be directly related to the percentage of deliveries in the formal health system. In the Dominican Republic, 10 per cent of infants lacked information on birthweight and over 90 per

than 10 per cent of infants in the sample were delivered without professional medical assistance. Further, infants who died were less than half as likely to have a reported birthweight as those that survived. Mothers with no education or with primary education were only 30 per cent and 60 per cent as likely to report a birthweight as mothers with secondary or higher education. Women with less than a secondary-level education constituted nearly 70 per cent of the sample. Finally, mothers from rural areas were only about half as likely to report a birthweight as their urban counterparts.
PREMATURITY STATUS
Whereas the birthweight distribution reported for the Dominican Republic appears to be generally consistent with corresponding values reported elsewhere, the reported level of prematurity seems less so. The (weighted) proportion of births reported as premature in the Dominican Republic sample is 4.4 per cent ± 0.8 (3.7 per cent unweighted), a value which is slightly below levels reported for Costa Rica and Chile, and markedly lower than values reported for the United States, Uruguay, and Cuba based on data from vital registration or clinical records (Table 3).
In the Dominican Republic sample, the incidence of prematurity is considerably below the incidence of LBW. Prematurity is less common than LBW in many populations because while

The proportion of women who received "modern" prenatal care in the Dominican Republic is higher than in most currently developing countries.

most preterm infants are LBW, some term infants will also be LBW as a consequence of intrauterine growth retardation (Villar and Belizan, 1982). However, further exploration of the association between birthweight and prematurity status raises additional suspicion about the accuracy of the Dominican Republic data. The extent of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is often approximated by the proportion of overall LBW accounted for by term births (Kessel et al., 1982; Ferraz et al., 1990). The Dominican Republic stands out from the other six countries shown in Table 3 in that term-LBW births account for a relatively high percentage of the overall incidence of LBW in the Dominican Republic. More than 70 per cent of the overall incidence of LBW is accounted for by term births (75 per cent unweighted), compared to between 39 per cent and 66 per cent in the other countries shown.
In their cross-national study, Villar and Belizan (1982) do find other countries (e.g., India and Guatemala) in which term infants account for 70 per cent or more of the incidence of LBW.

However, those countries tend to have LBW rates that are two to three times as high as that observed in the Dominican Republic DHS sample.5 They found that in countries with LBW incidence comparable to our estimate for the Dominican Republic, preterm infants accounted for 55 per cent to 65 per cent of the overall incidence of LBW. They concluded that when the incidence of LBW is less than 10 per cent, preterm infants represent the primary component of LBW. Because it is generally considered to be more difficult to reduce the incidence of preterm birth than the incidence of low birthweight, the combination of a low percentage of preterm births and a (relatively) high percentage of IUGR is unlikely. These findings strongly suggest that the incidence of preterm birth is understated in the Dominican Republic DHS data.
5Villar and Belizan (1982) estimate a 68 per cent contribution of term LBW for the Dominican Republic in 1975-76, but that was associated with a much higher estimate of the overall proportion of LBW (17.8 per cent) than was observed in our 1981-96 sample. Their Dominican Republic sample consisted of only 304 infants and was based on clinical records.

Substitution of the estimates from Equation (3) into Equation (2) and taking square roots of the results provides the estimated standard errors used to calculate the confidence intervals shown in Figures 2 and 3.
As shown in Figure la, the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) declines sharply with increasing birthweight from more than 260 per 1,000 among infants weighing less than 1,500 grams to a minimum of about 12 for those in the 3,500-3,999 gram group, followed by a moderate increase to 28 for infants weighing 4,500 grams or more. NMR for infants under 1,500 grams are significantly greater than those for infants weighing 1,500 grams or more (p < 0.05). Although the rates for infants in the next two categories (1,5001,999 and 2,000-2,499 grams) are also substantially greater than those in the heavier groups, the corresponding differences are not statistically significant because of small sample sizes in the low-birthweight categories. The pattern of post-neonatal mortality (PNMR) by birthweight (Figure 26) shows a similar decline with increasing birthweight, although the relative differences are smaller than in the neonatal period and are not statistically significant.
Mortality rates by birthweight and prematurity status jointly are presented in Figure 3, along with their 95% confidence intervals. In the neonatal period, premature infants have much higher mortality than infants born on time, regardless of their low birthweight status. For example, the relative risk of neonatal death for preterm compared to term infants is 21.2 (p<0.01), while the corresponding relative risk for LBW and normal

birthweight infants are 19.5 (p < 0.01) and 14.3 (p<0.01), respectively. LBW infants are at higher risk of neonatal death than their normal-weight counterparts (RR = 4.5, p<0.01). LBW and premature infants also have higher than average mortality in the post-neonatal period, but the differentials are far smaller than in the neonatal period. The relative risk of PNMR among preterm infants is 4.4 (p < 0.01), while the relative risk for LBW infants is 3.2. Infants with missing birthweight have neonatal mortality rates quite close to those for LBW infants (75 and 77 per 1,000, respectively; Figure 3d), but are characterized by more moderate mortality in the post-neonatal period (44 per 1,000 compared to 79 per 1,000 for LBW infants; Figure 3b).
Among infants for whom both birthweight and prematurity status are known, the infant mortality rate (IMR) is highest for infants reported to be both LBW and preterm (397 per 1,000) and lowest for normal-weight term infants (37 per 1,000) (not shown). These patterns correspond well with those reported by Mata (1978) based on a sample of Guatemalan children. Within either weight group in the Dominican Republic, the relative risk of infant death for preterm versus term birth is quite high: 5.0 and 7.4 among low and normal weight infants, respectively (p<0.01). The effects of higher reported birthweight on infant mortality within each of the two prematurity status groups are much smaller (i.e., the corresponding relative risks are not significantly greater than one at the 5 per cent level). These results stand in contrast to evidence from several studies discussed in Thomson (1983), which

demonstrate that when both variables are considered together, the influence of gestational age is small compared to the effects of birthweight, and that increasing gestational age has its largest effect among infants weighing at least 3,000 grams at birth. Furthermore, the IMR for the preterm, normal-weight group is far greater relative to the IMR's for the other weight/gestation classes in the Dominican Republic than has been observed elsewhere (Mata, 1978; Starfield et al., 1982).
Another notable finding is the extraordinarily high mortality among premature infants for whom birthweight information is missing (857 and 199 per 1,000 for NMR and PNMR, respectively). A closer examination of

the data shows that nearly 80 per cent of these infants died in their first week of life (not shown). Infants in this category thus constitute a very select group, apparently composed of those who were very unhealthy at birth and may never have been weighed.
DISCUSSION

mated in this study are consistent with corresponding patterns observed in other Latin American and Caribbean countries and in developed nations. Nevertheless, certain anomalies characterize the birthweight data and especially the prematurity data.
Two conspicuous irregularities in the birthweight data are the atypically high proportion of infants weighing 4,000 grams or more, and the high mortality rates among infants with missing birthweights, a finding which suggests that mothers were less likely to provide birthweight information for infants who died shortly after birth. Birthweight was also less likely to be reported by mothers with low educational attainment, rural residents, and

those who did not have professional medical assistance at their delivery, all high-risk subgroups. Because only about 10 pr cent of births lacked a birthweight in the Dominican Republic sample, however, these missing data should not lead to substantial bias in the estimated relations between socioeconomic and biodemographic variables and risk of low birthweight.
Several results suggest misreporting of prematurity status. First, the proportion premature is lower than in other countries with available data. Also problematic is the small proportion of LBW explained by preterm births in the Dominican Republic compared with other countries with a similar incidence of LBW. One possible

FIG. 36.-95% confidence intervals by birthweight and subjective prematurity status. Postneonatal mortality.

Examination of mortality rates by prematurity status and birthweight casts added doubt on the quality of the prematurity data. Particularly suspect is the very high relative risk of neonatal

death among infants reported to have been born prematurely compared to those born on time. The relative risks of mortality for preterm versus term infants--for the entire sample and

within birthweight groups--are far higher than those reported in other studies and may reflect a tendency to report retrospectively infants who died in their first month as premature, rather than a "true" effect of short gestation on the risk of dying. The high relative risks for infants reported as premature could also result from the use of a low cutoff duration to define preterm birth. Another piece of evidence that raises concern about the quality of the prematurity status data is that infants born more than three years before the interview are only half as likely to be reported as premature, suggesting that the data may be affected by recall bias.
Despite these discouraging results, our study does not rule out the possibility of collecting data on gestational age through retrospective surveys. It is quite possible that the inconsistencies observed in the Dominican Republic sample derive primarily from the absence of a definition of "premature." We recommend that, in future surveys, questions on gestational age include prompts based on specific gestation lengths (number of weeks or months) in order to provide a consistent definition of the desired concept. Questions of this type have been included in other retrospective surveys. For example, in the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, a question on duration of pregnancy was supplemented by a question on whether the infant was born before the expected due date, and if so, by how many weeks (Center for Human Resources Research, 1988). A similar question was asked in Round II of the Malaysian Family Life Survey (RAND corporation).

We also recommend that all mothers be asked for their subjective assessment of prematurity status, in spite of the misreporting problems described above. This subjective information offers the analyst approximate estimates for the potentially large fraction of women who will not be able to recall a numerical gestation length. An analysis of the experimental Demographic and Health Survey in Peru indicated that approximate assessments of the infant's size at birth (e.g., very small, average, etc.) for the full sample of births, combined with numerical estimates (available for only 68 per cent of the sample), led to improved estimates of the incidence and correlates of low birthweight (Moreno and Goldman, 1990). The Peru findings suggest that estimates of birthweight and gestational age based on a combination of numerical and subjective information are apt to be less biased than those based solely on subsamples with the relevant numerical information. Such an approach would facilitate the study of birthweight and gestational age in countries where vital statistics are very defective or nonexistent, or where the number of births delivered in the formal health system is small. Coordination of these surveys with a nationally representative study of data on birthweight and gestational age collected at the time of the birth would also contribute to our knowledge about the quality of retrospectively recalled data on these important determinants of infant health. Finally, discussion of the concept of "on time" birth and its measurement in a focus-group setting could provide important information about the contexts in which high quality in-

formation on gestational age could be collected. For example, it may be unrealistic to expect accurate reporting of prematurity status in populations where few women receive prenatal care or calendar numeracy is poor.
