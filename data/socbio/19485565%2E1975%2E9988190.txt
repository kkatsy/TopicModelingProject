This paper will compare life expectancy in countries with high suicide and homicide rates before and after eliminating suicide and homicide as causes of death. Only two countries with high homicide rates, Colombia and Mexico, are included because of the unavailability of complete demographic data for other countries with high homicide rates. The United States is included in the study since both suicide and homicide rates are relatively high.
In previous research (Silins and Zayachkowski, 1968; Preston et al., 1972; Schoen and Collins, 1973), suicide and homicide were not considered as independent causes of death in constructing multiple-decrement tables. Rather, the research focused primarily on calculating the hypothetical gains in life expectancy resulting from elimination of organic diseases such as respiratory tuberculosis, infectious and parasitic diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.
The focus on suicide and homicide as causes of death is of special interest to sociologists and criminologists who attempt to assess the impact of these social problems by employing a demographic model.
A traditional approach to assessing the

importance of various social problems has been to evaluate their economic impact. The President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice presented its report on Crime and Its Impact--An Assessment (1967). In this report, willful homicide is estimated to cause a loss of 750 million dollars. This figure was reached by estimating the economic loss of the worker's productive life, the financial burden on the victim's dependents, medical bills before his death, etc. The report (1967, p. 42) acknowledges the fact that "The costs of lost or damaged lives, of fear and of suffering, and of the failure to control critical events cannot be measured solely in dollars and cents." Any assessment of human life in terms of dollars and cents creates uneasiness, since life itself is regarded as the highest value known to human beings.
The assessment of suicide and homicide in terms of their impact on life expectancy figures can be regarded as another approach to evaluating the importance of these social problems. The question raised is: What will be the average gains in life expectancy resulting from the elimination

of suicide and homicide as causes of death? Findings from this research cannot be of direct relevance to social planning or law enforcement agencies simply because no consensus can be reached about how many lost lives a given community can tolerate before it begins to consider suicide or homicide as a serious social problem. On the other hand, the comparison of the average gains in life expectancy by eliminating suicide and homicide in relation to eliminating major causes of death, such as cardiovascular diseases, can present a meaningful demographic comparison of the magnitude of the problem.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The mathematical-demographic model where a single cause of death is eliminated is known as the associated single-decrement table (Jordan, 1952; Preston et al., 1972). The theory and specification of such tables is presented by Greville (1948, 1954), Spiegelman (1968) and Preston et al. (1972). By constructing a life table, it is possible to divide the value of dx into specific causes of death, where dx is the number dying during each age interval for every 100,000 persons born alive.
Following Greville (1948) and Spiegelman (1968), I adopted the following mathematical-demographic model.

The probability ,,í**"* of surviving n years after reaching age x in a life table when the specific cause of death (»"th cause) is eliminated is colog ,,Px~{ = ,,>·*-'· colog nPx. Here, nPx is the value obtained from the life table when all causes of death are present. The parameters for the life table in which the cause i is eliminated are derived as follows: lx+n~* = h-*. nP*-* and nd«-< = 1.-* - *.+,,-« (/.) equals the number of survivors reaching exact age x. The formula for deriving «£*"', which is the life table population on the number alive in the age group x to x + n, was derived in the following way (see Greville, 1954):

nDx = the number of deaths occurring during the period between ages x and x -f- «.
,,DJ = a part of ,,Dx which denotes death rates between ages x and x -\- n resulting from a specific cause (»)·
The probability of dying from a specific cause (the *'th cause) is:

RESULTS
In the first step of the data analysis, the aim was to compare suicide as a cause of death to other major causes of death. Quiriby et al. (1972, pp. 38-39) demonstrated that heart disease was almost unanimously ranked as the leading cause of

ranked fifth, fourth, and sixth, respectively.
Quinby et al. classified adult deaths "according to a somewhat modified form of the internationally recommended 'Abbreviated List' of SO causes of death" (1972, p. 2). The International Classification of Diseases wasnot used in the report since the data were collected before the classification went into effect. No breakdown was provided by Quinby et al. (1972) on the specific breakdown of various heart diseases.

The selection of countries for the demographic analysis was based on the magnitude of suicide and homicide reported for the various countries and the availability of epidemiological and demographic data. The first country selected was Hungary, which reported the highest suicide rate in the world--28.6 per 100,000 persons in 1964. The suicide rate for males was 40.9 per 100,000. The life tables were constructed for males since men tend to commit suicide or to be victims of homicide

varied considerably from one society to Table 1 presents only the final product another. The mean rank of suicide as a of the life table analysis for males in Huncause of death was found to be 7.6. How-

ever, in Hungary it was ranked as the fifth leading cause of death, and in New Zealand and Norway it was ranked tenth. Quinby et al. (1972) did not report data on suicide in developing countries.

The data for this study were extracted from the World Health Organization Annual Epidemiological and Vital Statistics (1964). A major concern in utilizing this source of data is the assessment of its reliability and validity. Examination of suicide and homicide data from 1953-70 revealed that the rank ordering of countries with regard to suicide and homicide remained stable for the entire period. This fact does not imply, of course, that no change took place in suicide and homicide rates during these years.1
The establishment of the validity of the data is a rather complex issue. With im-

Column 4 presents the average life expectancy after the elimination of arteriosclerotic and degenerative heart disease, generally considered to be the leading cause of death among cardiovascular diseases. As stated previously, since heart disease is the leading cause of death in developed countries, the difference between the values of Column 1 and all the other columns will demonstrate the gain in life expectancy when a specific cause of death is eliminated; this is the value (e~l). Theaverage gain in life expectancy from eliminating suicide is 0.75years

The highest level of homicide reported is for Colombia--25.5 per 100,000 persons. Complete data on the average gain in life expectancy for males in Colombia due to the elimination of various causes of death is presented in Table 2. From this table it is evident that the elimination of homicide as a cause of death will result in an average life expectancy gain of 1.32 years for newborn males. The average gain in life expectancy due to the elimination of heart disease is relatively lower, 0.92 years. The elimination of suicide will result in an average gain of 0.16 years.

tion cannot be inferred from observing the effect of eliminating each individually" (1972, p. SI).A separate analysis was conducted combining suicide and homicide into a single category, and the results showed that the sum of average gain in life expectancy with homicide and suicide eliminated individually approximated rather well the average gain obtained when both were considered simultaneously. Generally, the average gain in life expectancy tends to be higher when both causes of death are considered simultaneously.

death from suicide and homicide, I have included infectious and parasitic diseases in the analysis. The elimination of this cause of death in developed countries showed a higher average gain in life expectancy than that obtained by eliminating homicide. However, the gain was relatively small (0.09) on the average. The United States was the only developed country where elimination of homicide produced a higher gain in life expectancy than the gain achieved by eliminating infectious and parasitic diseases.. For Colombia and Mexico, the elimination of these diseases produced a higher average gain in life expectancy than did the elimination of suicide, but less than homicide. However, the gain was less than that produced by eliminating homicide as a cause of death. The average gain in life expectancy was 0.94 for Colombia and 0.53 for Mexico.
SUMMARY
The demographic analysis in this paper demonstrates the average gain in life expectancy after the hypothetical elimination of various causes of death. For developed

countries, the elimination of heart disease will usually increase the average gain in life expectancy more than the elimination of suicide and homicide together. Furthermore, the elimination of infectious and parasitic diseases will increase the average gain in life expectancy more than elimination of homicide as a cause of death. This conclusion does not necessarily hold true for developing countries, which have a higher rate of violence, a higher rate of infectious and parasitic diseases, and a lower level of heart disease than developed countries.
The average gain in life expectancy for the United States caused by the elimination of heart disease is 10.5 times higher than the gain in life expectancy when suicide is eliminated. It is eleven times higher than when homicide is eliminated. Hungary, which has the highest rate of suicide in the world, will increase the average life expectancy by less than a year by eliminating suicide.
These hypothetical results are not incompatible with the sociological treatment of homicide and suicide as serious social problems. Although from the demographic

perspective a more substantial gain in life expectancy will result from eliminating organic rather than social diseases, suicide and homicide will continue to be of major concern to society since both result in loss of human life.
