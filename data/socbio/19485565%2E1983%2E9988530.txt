ABSTRACT: Comparison of birthplaces of parents and offspring in Longford, Ireland, shows a high proportion of offspring with birthplaces outside of Ireland. Upon closer examination it was found that the majority of these children had parents who themselves were born in Ireland. These findings indicate a high rate of return migration, whereby an emigrant returns to his/her place of origin. These findings have three genetic implications: (1) Return migration may act to lower the total rate of long-range gene flow into a population. (2) Comparison of parent and offspring migration data without taking return migration into account may lead to incorrect inferences of demographic change. (3) Failure to account for return migration may produce inaccurate estimates of genetic variation based on migration parameters.

A major interest in anthropological genetics has been the investigation of differing patterns of human migration and their subsequent effects on mate choice and gene frequency variation. While a variety of genetic and demographic models dealing with migration have been developed, a number of studies have shown human migration to be more complex than shown by simple models of gene flow. Such studies have revealed a number of interesting effects, such as non-Markovian migration (Kramer, 1981), effects of population size on rates of population interaction (Lalouel and Langaney, 1976; Relethford et al., 1981), differential migration to specific populations (Devor, 1980; Brennan and Relethford, 1983), and kin-structured migration (Fix, 1978). The last is particularly interesting, since it illustrates a means by which migration might act to increase,rather than decrease, interpopulational variaility.
One aspect of human migration which has not yet been looked at from a population genetic perspective is return

migration, which refers to movement of an individual back to his/her birthplace to resettle (Gmelch, 1980). Return migration has become more frequent during the last century, particularly in Europe. The reasons for return migration are varied, but most often are psychological in nature, such as family ties or strong feelings toward one's homeland. A detailed review of return migration may be found in Gmelch (1980).
The purpose of this paper is to provide an example of return migration using data collected in Ireland and to interpret potential genetic consequences.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data reported here were collected during the summer of 1977 in the city of Longford, County Longford, the Republic of Ireland as part of a growth study of Irish schoolchildren. Anthropometric and skin reflectance measures were collected for boys from St. Michael's School and boys and girls from the Melview School. Portions of these

data have been reported elsewhere (Relethford et al., 1978; Lees et al., 1979). A total of 361children, ranging in age from four to 14 years, were measured.
As part of our study we collected information on the county of birth for all children and their mothers and fathers. Complete birthplace data were available for 321 children (and 642 parents). We combined all birthplaces into three categories for analysis: (1) those born in County Longford, (2) those born elsewhere in Ireland (and Northern Ireland), and (3) those born outside of Ireland.
RESULTS
The number of mothers, fathers, and offspring are reported in Table 1 by birthplace. For both parents and offspring, the greatest proportion of individuals were born in County Longford, followed by the rest of Ireland, and then followed by those born outside of Ireland. Birthplace distributions of mothers and fathers are not significantly different (*2 = 4.62, df = 2, P > 0 . 0 5 ) . Birthplace distributions for the combined parent and offspring samples are significantly different (x2 = 38.36, df=2, P < 0.001). The sources of this difference were assessed using the Mest for equality of percentages (Sokal and

Rohlf, 1969) for each birthplace category. The proportions of parents and offspring born in County Longford are not significantly different (f = --1.41, df = oo,p > 0.05). A significantly greater proportion of parents were born in the rest of Ireland compared to offspring (f = 4.36, df = oo, P< 0.001), and a significantly greater proportion of offspring were born outside of Ireland compared to parents (t = 5.06, df=<», P < 0.001).
At first glance, these findings might suggest several demographic interpretations. For example, the greater proportion of long-range migrants among offspring could reflect an increase in such migration into Longford over time. Another interpretation is return migration, where a large proportion of offspring born outside of Ireland have parents who were born in Ireland. This interpretation is supported by an investigation of the birthplaces of parents of the 44 children who were born outside of Ireland, reported in Table 2. Here, a high percentage of these children have one or both parents who were born in Ireland (93.8 per cent). Also, a high percentage of these children have one or both parents born in County Longford (70.5 per cent). Thus, the majority of the longrange migration of offspring reported in Table 1is due to return migration on the part of the parents.

DISCUSSION
There are several genetic implications of return migration in human populations. The net effort of return migration would be to lower the overall rate of long-range migration. Given the fact that return migration tends to be a relatively recent occurrence (Gmelch, 1980), a decrease in total gene flow might be expected in certain populations during recent times. In genetic terms, this would mean a decrease in the rate at which local gene frequencies become closer to regional values, an increase in the potential effects of genetic drift, and an increase in the degree of random inbreeding. Obviously, the extent of such changes would depend on the rate of return migration relative to other immigration. Based on our findings here, rates of return migration might be expected to be rather high in some populations. More research is needed to ascertain the genetic effects of return migration under varying population structures.
Return migration also has an important implication when migration data are used to assess demographic change over time. As noted above, the high percentage of offspring born outside of Ireland (13.7 per cent) relative to the percentage of parents born outside of

Ireland (4.2 per cent) might suggest an increase in long-range migration from one generation to the next. Once return migration is accounted for, the actual percentage of long-range migrants among the children is considerably lower (2.2 per cent), suggesting a decrease in long-range migration over time. Of course, more data are needed to evaluate this hypothesis. The main point is that return migration can act to inflate migration estimates.
Another aspect of return migration relates to the use of estimates of longrange migration in measures of genetic drift and consanguinity (see CavalliSforza and Bodmer, 1971). The use of a migration estimate which includes return migration will clearly be an overestimate, resulting in lower estimates of random inbreeding and potential genetic drift. In situations such as the present study, where the long-range migration estimate of offspring is 3.3 times that of the parents, widely different genetic parameters could be estimated depending on which generation is sampled.
In sum, we note that there are a number of ways in which return migration could affect the genetic structure of a population. We hope future research will be geared toward a more complete understanding of this phenomenon.
