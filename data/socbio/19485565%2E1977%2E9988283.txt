ABSTRACT: The interactive behavior of two-year-old male twins (17 MZ, 29 DZ pairs) with their parents was observed in the home and laboratory. Behavior counts, ratings, and experimental measures were subjected to a biometrical genetic analysis. A model which included only withinand between-families environmental effects fitted most variables best, except for Instrumental Independence (a rating) and Speech Rate (a count variable) which showed a significant genetic component. Low reliability may explain the small proportion of genetic variation in count variables, but the greater reliability of ratings and experimental measures (the latter, however, of doubtful construct validity) did not produce greater genetic determination. The largest part of the variance was explained by between-families environmental differences', only a minor part of which was due to interobserver differences. The probability of detecting genetic determination with this sample size, although it was large for an ethological study, is rather low.

Ethological methods and outlook have recently attracted behavioral scientists and have led them to look at human behavioral characteristics from an evolutionary perspective. Thus, attachment behavior has been viewed from the point of view of its evolutionary significance (e.g., Bowlby, 1971) and so has compliance with the norms of the social group (e.g., Stay ton et al., 1971). An evolutionary perspective, however, inevitably implies partial genetical control of behavior, as evidenced by the question: "Why does this kind of animal solve those problems of survival in this way? (What is the evolutionary history of the behavior?)" (Blurton-Jones, 1974, p. 266). In the typical ethological study it is assumed, from a knowledge of the animal's ontogeny combined with observation, that learning plays little part in the development of certain kinds of behavior, which are then classified as innate. Both animal ethologists and those applying the ethological approach to human be-

havior have generally fought strangely shy of genetical studies proper (cf. Gould, 1974), although some exceptions exist, (e.g., Freedman, 1974).
Historically, ethological investigations have concentrated on describing "typical" patterns of behavior and have tended to ignore individual differences. Although this procedure may have been justified in the descriptive natural-history phase of the subject, an investigation of the causes of individual differences could lead to a more profound understanding of the biological importance and evolutionary history of the traits in question.
While it is possible to investigate human behavior and characteristics by means of questionnaires and tests, it is difficult to know how to approach the problem of social interactive behavior in the family or other group. It is in this area that the ethological approach has been increasingly used in recent years. When done with twins, such investigations provide a wel-

come opportunity to investigate the differences between individuals in observed interactive behavior from a genetical point of view.
This paper reports the biometrical genetical analysis of interactive behavior and other measures for two-year-old male sets of twins. The investigation was undertaken in order to assess the relative importance of genetical and environmental contributions to variation in certain social characteristics of young children, as well as to examine the development of these characteristics in the context of parent-child interaction. The characteristics focused on were compliance, attachment, independence, speech, and activity level. Child-parent interactive behavior was studied by means of naturalistic observation in the home, i.e., by an essentially ethological method, but was supplemented by interviews and ratings as well as by experimental procedures.
One assumption underlying the twin method, that parents make no greater distinctions between DZ twins than they do between MZ twins, is discussed (and essentially shown to be correct) in a separate paper (Lytton, 1977).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE
The sample consisted of 46 sets of male twins (17 MZ and 29 DZ), as well as 44 male singletons. Mean ages of the three groups were (in months): MZ, 32.0; DZ, 32.4; and singletons, 33.4. The age range was 25 to 35 months.
Twins were located through the birth registers of the local hospitals. The expectation is that after the first year of life surviving same-sex twin pairs represent 0.64 per cent of the population, and therefore 0.32 per cent will be same-sex pairs (Allen, 1955). This statistic provides an expectation of 25.6 same-sex male pairs

per year, given approximately 8,000 births per year in Calgary. We ascertained 25 born in 1969 and 26 born in 1970; therefore our ascertainment approximates the theoretical expectation very closely. Of these pairs, 14 were not included in the investigation: in three pairs, one partner had died, six families had left the city, two families did not speak English in the home, one could not be traced, and two refused to participate. While no data are available to compare those not included with those participating, the sample represents a very large proportion of the total male twin population born during those years, and there is no reason to suspect that the sample differs from the total population to any significant extent. Nine of the twin sets came from nearby towns. All available twins were seen, even if the mother was the only parent in the home (four families). The twin sample consisted of approximately one-third middle-class and two-thirds working-class families, based on father's occupation (Blishen, 1967), and singletons were chosen so that their social class distribution would be the same. The subjects were all white.
Zygosity of the twins was ascertained after the psychological investigation by blood typing of between 16 and 22 blood group systems. In five cases, when blood typing was impossible, zygosity was ascertained by finger ridge counts and physical similarity profile. By ascertaining zygosity after the testing, the chance was lessened of an observer having preconceived notions of how similar or different twins should be.
While many of the variables regressed on age, analysis of covariance showed that none of the differences in means of MZ and DZ groups and only three of the mean differences between twin and singleton groups (Variables 15, 16, and 23) could be accounted for by different age compositions of the groups.

Although every effort was made to obtain twin and singleton groups matched by father's occupation, when the sample had been ascertained it was found that groups differed slightly in the distribution of mother's education (see Table 1.) While the chi-squares for differences between twins and singletons and between MZand DZ groups are not significant, it is evident that mothers' education is somewhat higher among singleton compared with twin families and among DZ compared with MZ families. (The latter could, of course, not be matched before the experiment.)

included in the observation whenever possible, but in some cases they were unavoidably absent. Therefore, we have records for fathers of only 38 sets of twins. The behavior of the target twins, as well as any behavior of others that impinged on them, was recorded continuously by dictating coded statements into a microphone held close to the mouth. The observation records were transferred to punched cards and analyzed by computer. A second observer was present for the second session in each home for the purpose of interviewing and rating the mother.
Mothers were interviewed regarding

Differences between twins and singletons and between twin and singleton parents are discussed in a separate report (Lytton et al., 1977). In fact, only a fewof these differences could be accounted for by disparities between the groups in mother's education.
PROCEDURE
Since the method employed in-the-home observations, and its attendant problems are discussed in detail in Lytton (1973), only a brief outline will be given here. Data on parent-child interaction were obtained from two three-hour observation sessions, during which unstructured family interaction was noted in predetermined code by trained observers. Fathers were

their perceptions of the children's characteristics as well as their own childrearing practices and attitudes, and some fathers were given a questionnaire containing parallel questions. Mothers were also asked to write an hour-by-hour account over a 24-hour period of all the incidents concerning the children and their own reactions to them ("diary").
MEASURES
Behavior Counts.--Specified types of behavior were categorized from the observation record, and summed frequency counts were computed for child, mother, and father. The measure of compliance (called "comply ratio") was the ratio of all instances of compliance to the total com-

scale often made very little difference to the results of the analysis of second-degree statistics in «mall samples. It was therefore decided to carry out the initial genetic analyses on untransformed data in the belief that the extra refinement would not substantially affect the conclusions. Inspection of the distributions of variables displaying sum-difference regressions (6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 18) suggested that a squareroot transformation might remove the nonnormality of the distributions and the regressions. The transformation was successful for Variables 6, 9, and 18, but made little difference to the results of the genetical analysis of these variables.

The £ i model tests the hypothesis that all the mean squares are the same, i.e., that all the variance is due to error or individual environmental experiences and none is caused by systematic cultural or genetical effects. We can see that this model fits the data for four of the five playroom experimental variables, and the data for PPVT IQ, a test that was administered to nearly all subjects in the playroom. This finding confirms our suspicions aroused by the poor construct validity of the experimental variables (discussed in Lytton, 1974) and problematic standardization of the PPVT. It suggests that much of the behavior elicited in the playroom

that other causes account for the greater part of the between families variance, E2.
CONCLUSIONS
The only variables in this study for which the genetic contribution was significant were instrumental independence (a rating) and speech rate (a count variable). The latter variable which represents speech facility in a natural situation is probably a more reliable predictor of later intelligence than the PPVT score, a vocabulary score obtained in a test situation which depends on motivational and attentional factors that are very variable in two-year-old children.
The difficulty of measuring interactive behavior reliably by means of behavior counts has been noted. The low reliability over occasions and between observers and other anomalies were, no doubt, part of the reason why very little genetic determination of variation could be found in the count variables. But, although ratings and experimental scores showed greater reliability, the genetic contribution to these measures was no higher. (As discussed above, however, the construct validity of the experimental scores was doubtful.)
Furthermore, recent power calculations (Martin, in preparation) have shown that the probability of detecting even large amounts of genetic variation with samples of this size is rather low. Yet the authors know of no study involving detailed direct observation of behavior that has a larger sample, particularly since 44 singletons were also included in this investigation. This fact is not surprising in view of the expenditure of time involved. It took about 27 hours' work to gather and process all the data for one twin pair up to the time they were punched on cards. If such an ethological approach is thought useful because it increases ecological validity, one will have to be satisfied with what, for a genetical analysis, is a small sample.

The present results contrast with the findings of some earlier work, employing ratings (e.g., Scarr, 1969) and with those of some recent large twin studies (Eaves and Eysenck, 1974, 1975, 1976) which found intermediate heritabilities for a variety of adult personality dimensions assessed by self-report questionnaires. Furthermore, these studies suggested that environmental differences between families (E2) did not contribute significantly to variation in these personality dimensions. On the other hand, the low degree of genetic determination detected in our investigation is consistent with some earlier research in personality (e.g., Gottesman, 1966, compared with Nichols, 1969). However, since environmental influences and gene expression may well change with age (e.g., Eaves and Eysenck, in press), comparisons between our study and those of adult subjects could well be misleading.
For most of the present personality characteristics, the largest part of the variance was explained by differences between families. These differences were partly due to interobserver differences, but they also reflected varying childrearing situations and differences in cultural milieu. The systematic differences between twins and singletons, for instance (see Lytton et al., 1977) seem to be an expression of such environmental variations. An interesting question is whether an investigation at a later age could detect greater genetic determination in variables collected in an ethological study such as this one.
