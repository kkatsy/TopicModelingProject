In a study of hypotheses about aging, Damon and Roen (1973) use grayness of hair as an indicator of rate of aging. Grayness of hair is, of course, positively correlated with age (0.54 to 0.76 in 15 series studied by Damon and Roen). In testing the correlation of pulse rate with grayness, Damon and Roen found inconsistent results among various series studied. When age was held constant in one of their studies of 440 healthy white males, the positive correlation coefficient of pulse rate and grayness was statistically significant.
If age is held constant, does graying of hair remain a significant criterion of aging in other respects such as mortality? If the hypothesis that grayness of hair is symptomatic of aging even when chronological age is held constant, then one might expect positive correlations between grayness of head hair and likelihood of death from natural causes in a fixed period of subsequent years. The observation that men tend to gray earlier than women would also be consistent with the hypothesis,1 since age-specific death rates are lower in women than in men at all ages.
A follow-up study of mortality in a

population in which grayness of head hair had been observed and recorded 21 years previously presents an opportunity to test this question.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In 1948, we interviewed and examined 480 adult Mexicans in Paracho, Michoacan, and scored each as to occurrence of gray hair: 0 for none, 1 for slight, 2 for moderate, and 3 for general. The category "slight" included individuals with only one or a few gray hairs; "moderate" indicated individuals with some parts of the scalp showing a scattering of gray hairs among predominantly pigmented hairs; and "general" referred to individuals with numerous gray hairs in all parts of the scalp.
In 1969 the death registers for all the intervening years were examined; 75 of the men and 26 of the women had died (98 were listed; informants told us of the deaths of three others). Ages were recorded during interviews in 1948 and later checked with the death records.
Since few individuals under age 35 showed any gray hairs and there were no cases of precocious graying in our series, the analysis was confined to individuals aged 35 or older. The few individuals aged

70 or older in 1948 were not included in the analyses of mortality, since virtually all had died by 1969.
Comparisons of differences between the sexes was on the basis of i-score analysis of the differences of scores of the individuals of either sex from the mean for their respective five-year age group. Mean scores for each five-year age group of each sex were then separately calculated, and differences between those known to have died of natural causes and all others were

evaluated by i-score analysis of differences between the means of these age-sex adjusted scores. A comparison between those who reported their parents to be "/»digenes" (Indian) and those who considered their parents to be "Mestizos" (Indian and Spanish) or other was made in the same way.

Age groups 3 5 ^ 9 combined show a positive association of no graying (0) and likelihood of having survived (chi-square with Yates correction, 4.37 in males, 8.86 in females). Individuals of each sex aged 50-69 show a tendency in the same direction if separated into no (0) and slight (1) gray hair versus moderate (2) and general (3) graying, but the data yield low nonsignificant chi-squares.
Since the correlation with age within such wide age groups may account for at least some of the positive association, age was discounted by comparing each grayness score with the mean of its own fiveyear age group of the same sex. The 55 individuals of these ages known to have died nonviolent deaths average 0.25 units of graying above their age-sex means, and the 183 not known to have died average

POSSIBLE HAIR DYEING
If there were artificial dyeing of the hair by some individuals, and if these individuals also had lower mortality risks than others, our results could be explained by the association between the two factors. For instance, if dyeing of hair were practiced more by the healthy than by the ill, our findings could be seriously biased.
The possibility of hair tinting is suggested by the somewhat lower frequency of gray hair by age group for females than for niales. However, in 1948 we investigated the possible use of hair dye and found that while some women were aware of the practice, none we know of used it. By 1973, dyeing was practiced, but even then apparently only by young women. We find it hard to believe that hair dyeing could be a biasing factor in this study.

ASSUMPTION OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTION OF GKAYNESS
Our use of a rating scale of only four points (0, 1, 2, and 3), not necessarily equally spaced, leads to a distribution of score differences from the age-sex means which is not completely normal. For instance, when scored as we have done, the distribution is truncated at + 3 and -- 3 . Nevertheless, the actual distributions are roughly symmetrical and normal in appearance. Any departure from normality would have no effect on the direction of the difference and only a small effect on estimation of its significance. Non-normality does not warrant rejection of the implications of the /-score, provided that the level of probability (p) is not taken to be exact. An alternative nonparametric mode of analysis, such as the comparison of the medians of attainment curves, has the disadvantage of losing informational value from already scant data.

we did not record a majority of males with moderate or more grayness until age 55 in Mexico, while among the Irish a majority of males 45-49 years old already showed medium or pronounced grayness. In a comparable study of inhabitants of three communities on the north coast of Peru (unpublished), we found graying to proceed as among the Mexicans, but the onset was often even later than in Mexicans.
Both the Mexican and the Peruvian populations trace ancestry to both Indians and Europeans. Although any remaining significance tends to be cultural, racial designations retain some biological meaning (Kaplan and Lasker, 1953; Lasker and Kaplan, 1965). We therefore calculated the grayness scores of the Mexicans aged 35 or over who listed both parents as "Indigenes" separately from those of Mexicans who listed at least one parent as "Mestizo," white, or the like. The latter have higher age-adjusted grayness scores than the former (t = 2.96, ¿5 < 0.01).

individuals who were older than reported might be grayer and might also have a higher likelihood of death, and vice versa. Comparison of ages on the death records with those of the interviews revealed that 21 of them differed by more than 4 years. The death-record ages are reported by a member of the family and are probably less accurate than the birthdate or age given by the individual himself a number of years earlier and used in this study. In any case, in the few instances where age in the death records places the individual in a different five-year age group from that used, the associations of grayness with the likelihood of death are increased about as many times as they are reduced. After examining the influence of all discrepancies, we judge the influence of errors in reported chronological age to be small. The effect of this factor would be to produce the association we find, but the extent of the factor is very small.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In summary, among the 480 Mexican adults examined in 1948, 101 were known to have died by 1969. Of the 91 who died of natural causes, those between the ages of 35 and 69 when examined had, on the average, grayer hair than others of equivalent sex and age. None of various factors considered seems adequate to explain this finding. However, the data on nineteen additional deaths during 1969-73 do not strengthen the case for an association of earlier gray hair with earlier mortality, and the finding is far from unequivocal.
In conclusion, there may be a relationship of graying of hair to senescence. If confirmed, it may represent a tendency for pathological processes in some individuals within the population to cause earlier grayness and, occasionally, earlier death. If such a cause is merely an early stage of senescence and not recognizable as a disease, recognition of such a relation-
