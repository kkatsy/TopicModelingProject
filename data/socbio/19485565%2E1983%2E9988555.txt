The brain drain, or the migration of trained manpower from one country to another, is an important phenomenon in social biology. Discussing this problem, Gwee (1973) exemplified with India as follows: "A crash programme in education would help to solve the problem of shortage of brain power far better than most of the ineffectual efforts to reduce brain drain. An objection to this is the possibility of creating such an excess of trained persons that there is no way to utilize them, and a greater brain drain will result. This has in fact happened in India "
Inhaber (1975) dealt exclusively with India in his own contribution to this journal when evaluating the significance of the brain drain on developing countries. He used a relatively standardized method by compiling the numbers of Indian scientists publishing in the major technical journals of the world with reference to their residence in the host or home country. In particular, he employed 43 groups of common Indian names in tabular form to demonstrate

that "a significant proportion of the stock of Indian scientists was lost from 1967 to 1972, primarily to economically advanced countries."
The object of this paper is to study the brain drain from India by using the tabulated 43 common Indian names with another method for obtaining a standardized count. Elsewhere (Onuigbo, 1982), I have presented the novel method of counting reprint requests ·containing printing errors in order to gain some insight into communication processes. Here, let me provide total counts of the reprint requests which I received personally from Indian researchers resident at home or abroad.
During the decade from 1970 to 1979 inclusive, I published 44 papers on cancer as regards anatomical dissemination (18), geographical distribution (14), and historical disquisition (12). These papers appeared mostly in the United States and United Kingdom but were also purposely published in diverse countries, namely, Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Germany,

India, Ireland, Japan, Nigeria, Poland, and Switzerland. The publications yielded a total of 1,806 reprint requests from workers in numerous countries. These requests have been analyzed using the published 43 uniquely Indian names in order to distinguish between home-based and foreign-based researchers.
Table 1 shows that 14 of the listed names are represented in my collection. For a total of 29 requests, only 2 came from India itself, the rest being from the following host countries: United States, 17; Canada, 8; United Kingdom, 1; and Japan,1.
Of interest was the fact that there were in many cases no data to indicate whether the requester was permanently or temporarily domiciled in the foreign country. However, one researcher gave his status as Professor of Genetics and another as Chief of the Surgical Service. A third worker based in Canada made

six separate requests over a period of years, indicating thereby a degree of permanency in consonance with the brain drain phenomenon.
It should be mentioned that I received four other requests from domiciles of India which bore certain unlisted names: Kothari, Laumas, Mathan, and Sopory. Accordingly, such scientists bearing the less common Indian names are also likely to be numerous among those who requested my reprints from outside their home country. The probability, therefore, is that much larger series will throw optimum light on the full spectrum of the brain drain from India. Of course, such series should embrace diverse fields of research.
The element of clustering, which is noteworthy in science (Frame et al., 1977), was found in this study. Thus, of the 6 requests from India, as many as 4 were from New Delhi, notably 3 from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and 1 from the Jawaharlal Nehru University. Similarly, of the 17 requests emanating from the United States, only 7 of the 50 states were represented, namely, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Texas and Virginia.
Hence, reprint requests should not be regarded by Todd (1977), Dirckx (1981), and others as an unworthy "game." As I see it, each request performs what may be called a "tracer function." Thus, with collected requests, I was able to trace the bibliographic role of Current Contents in information science (Onuigbo, 1982). Likewise, in the present study, these requests have been used to trace cancer researchers whose domiciliary attributes were consonant with the occurrence of brain drain from India to some developed countries.
