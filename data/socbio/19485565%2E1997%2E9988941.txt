ABSTRACT: The data presented here are part of an on-going longitudinal study of the relationship between socioeconomic status and mortality in the major metropolitan centers of Ohio. Using a Standardized Mortality Ratio, we find that mortality in the seven-city urban aggregate exceeds that of the rest of the state by 39 per cent for the nonwhite population and only 1 per cent for the white population. Further, for the nonwhite population, living in a high income area has no discernible health benefit for nonwhites as compared to whites. On the other hand, for the AIDS virus, there is a clear inverse association between economic status and mortality from AIDS. It is clear that the interrelationship among race, economic status, and health continues to be a complex one on which further research is needed.

One of the most dramatic developments in health during the present century has been the largely successful conquest of the major infectious diseases that once ranked as the major causes of death. Progress in the control of infectious diseases was initially attributed to improved environmental sanitation measures that led to a sharp reduction in the incidence of such diseases; and these preventive measures were subsequently augmented by the development of effective therapeutic agents, such as penicillin, that significantly enhanced our ability to cure such diseases. However, despite major progress in these areas, infectious diseases continue to represent a serious public health problem in our society (Curson, 1989). On the one hand, this problem is due to the persistence of older diseases, such as influenza and tuberculosis; on the other hand it is due to the emergence of

entirely new diseases, most notably the HIV virus.
Not only have infectious diseases continued to represent a serious health problem, but also there is evidence to indicate that infectious disease mortality has been increasing in recent years (Garrett, 1994). To illustrate, the overall death rate from infectious causes in the United States increased by 58 per cent between 1980 and 1992 (Pinner et al., 1996). A number of factors have been cited to explain this increase. Population aging, for example, has contributed to the rise in the death rate from infectious respiratory diseases; whereas the spread of the AIDS virus reflects behavior patterns relating to sexual contacts and intravenous drug use (Heyward and Curran, 1988). Another factor that may be cited as contributing to this problem relates to the relatively stagnant economy of recent years and the exacerbation of

poverty in American society. In Ohio, to illustrate, median family income in constant dollars rose by only 3 per cent during the 1980-90 decade, during which time the state's poverty rate rose from 10 to 12 per cent (Stockwell et al., 1994). The relevance of these trends with respect to infectious disease mortality and its recent upward trend are much more characteristic of low income ethnic minority populations (Curson, 1989, p. 164-65; Pinner et al., 1996, p. 191). The latter, according to Curson (p. 163), experience higher levels of infectious disease mortality because of limited access to health care services and because they are more likely to experience unhygienic and hazardous working and living conditions. The purpose of the present brief note is to explore further the socioeconomic and racial determinants of infectious disease mortality in the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data presented here have been derived as part of an on-going longitudinal study of the relationship between socioeconomic status and mortality in the major metropolitan centers of the state of Ohio. To date, the bulk of our analysis, some of which has appeared in previous issues of this journal (Stockwell and Wicks, 1985; Stockwell et al., 1987; Stockwell and Goza, 1995), has focused on infant mortality. Presently we are in the midst of a major expansion of our data base to include adult mortality and so far have created a basic data file covering the three years centering on the 1990 census. As in our original infant mortality research, the basic relationship between cause-specific adult mortality rates and socioeconomic status is examined within an ecological

framework in which the primary analytical unit is the census tract in which the decedent usually resided. The independent variable has been defined as the percentage of low income families in each census tract at the time of the decennial census. The low income cut-off point, defined as roughly 50 per cent of the median family income in metropolitan Ohio, was $15,000. The dependent variable data consist of counts of the number of deaths by age, race, and cause-of-death, occurring in each census tract during the three years 1989-91. Such data have been extracted for seven metropolitan centers in Ohio: Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo and Youngstown.
For purposes of the present research, we are defining the adult population as persons 20 years of age or over primarily because there are so few deaths at ages below 20 that including them would introduce a potential problem of rate instability at these ages. Thus, the mortality measures presented in the accompanying tables are based on deaths and population at ages 20 and over.
Although we eventually plan to undertake more sophisticated multivariate analyses based on individual tract data, our work to date has been limited to a social area type of analysis in which mortality measures have been calculated for broad combinations of census tracts. Specifically, we used the family income measure to aggregate the census tracts of the seven study cities into four broad income areas so that approximately 25 per cent of the tracts fell into each area.
In order to measure the association between area economic status and mortality we have employed a technique known as a Standardized Morality Ratio, or SMR (Shryock and Siegel et al., 1976, p. 233-

234). This technique seeks to eliminate the effects of area differences in age composition by estimating the number of deaths that would have occurred in any income area if the population of that area had experienced the age-specific death rates prevailing in a "Standard Population" (in this case the total population of the state). For each area, the SMR is then calculated as 100 times the ratio of the actually observed number of deaths to the estimated number. As such, the SMR measures the extent to which the mortality of a given area deviates from the overall state level which is indexed at 100. An SMR greater than 100 indicates a level of mortality that is in excess of the overall state level, whereas an SMR of less than 100 indicates a mortality level that is below that of the total population.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the Standardized Mortality Ratios, by race, for all causes of death in the study population. The first conclusion to be drawn from these data is that the relative level of mortality is notably higher in the urban aggregate than in the state as a whole. For the total population, the overall SMR of 111 indicates that, with the state level indexed at 100, the mortality level of the seven-city aggregate exceeds that of the state by 11 per cent. Since the urban population has a disproportionate share of the low-income high-risk population, this finding is not surprising. Note, for example, that the urban excess is fairly large for the nonwhite population (39 per cent) but is negligible for the white population (1 per cent). The second conclusion pertains to the nature of the relationship between mortality levels and socioeconomic status. For the to-

tal population, and for whites, there is a very clear and strong inverse association between SMR levels and neighborhood economic status. For nonwhites, however, there is a general U-shaped relationship with the highest economic area having the highest mortality level. This nonwhite pattern is similar to that observed in our earlier research on infant mortality (Stockwell and Goza, 1996) and can be taken as further evidence that living in a high income area has no discernible health benefit for nonwhites as compared to the white population.
Similar conclusions can be drawn concerning the racial differences in the relationship between economic status and mortality levels from the major infectious causes of death (see Table 2). Except for pneumonia and influenza, where the white SMR is 5 per cent below the overall state level, infectious disease mortality tends to be higher in the urban aggregate than in the general population. Moreover, for both infectious and parasitic diseases and pneumonia and influenza, there is a clear and very strong inverse association between SMR levels and economic status for the white population, but for nonwhites there is again a general U-shaped pattern.
A decidedly different conclusion can be drawn from Table 3 which presents the SMR's for the human immunodeficiency virus. Once again the incidence of AIDS mortality is notably higher in the sevencity urban aggregate than in the state as a whole; but in this case both whites and nonwhites are characterized by a pronounced inverse relationship between SMR levels and economic status. Thus, while nonwhites may not benefit generally from living in higher status neighborhoods, it is clear that the kinds of risk-taking
