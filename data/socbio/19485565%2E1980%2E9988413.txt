ABSTRACT:This report compares the 1977 genetic demographies of Colonsay and Jura, adjacent yet isolated islands of the Scottish Inner Hebrides. Completed family analyses demonstrated that the residents of Colonsay have higher fertility, shorter generation length, and longer female reproduction span than those of Jura. Based on oral genealogies of five to six generations, the natives of Jura had a higher inbreeding coefficient (f= 0.0044) than did those of Colonsay (f= 0.0023). Each set of natives mainly derives from small groups of "founding" ancestors. Founder effects in the populations are transitory phenomena dependent upon population decline and the periodic emigration of native families. With their small sizes, the maximum sampling errors due to random genetic drift are ±0.063 for Colonsay and ±0.059 for Jura per generation. An unusual finding was that the effective sizes of Colonsay and Jura exceed their respective breeding sizes. Today Colonsay and Jura are former geographical isolates in dissolution through an increasing marital admixture with immigrants. Human migration dictated in large part by Hebridean economics dominates the microevolutions of Colonsay and Jura.

of any community shrinks the scope of human biocultural variation yet another increment.
Two other aspects of the Colonsay and Jura studies are of theoretical interest. The first is that few other demographic studies of human populations have considered "multiple microevolutionary forces simultaneously" but have concentrated a priori upon one agent such as selection or random genetic drift (Tripp-Reimer, 1980, p. 255). The second is the question of whether ostensibly similar, or even proximal, populations (e.g., island communities or enclaves of immigrants) demographically evolve in similar fashion (Tripp-Reimer 1980, p. 262). The com-

parative genetic demographies of Colonsay and Jura demonstrate how external factors (such as economics and related migration) can supersede internal factors (such as inbreeding) in the structures of contemporary isolates.
Fix (1977, p. 709) observed that "much classical population genetics theory tended to sacrifice realism for the advantages of generality and mathematical tractability." Human population geneticists now appreciate how new, unusually complete sets of demographic data and their genetic implications best measure departures from equilibrium, identify the forces and rates of microevolution, and hence aid development of more realistic

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Colonsay andJura are dependentcommunities in the marginal economic area of Highland Scotland. The industrialized Lowlands utilize this region for taking away "primary and extractive products" later used in manufacturing and/or distributed in the cities. The Highlands and islands have experienced many "boomand-bust cycles" depending upon Lowland and English markets and investment (Prattis, 1979,pp. 361-362; cf. Ennew, 1980).
Under one landlord (or laird), Colonsay still retains its traditional crofting economy plus a direct ferry service from Oban on the west Scottish mainland. Jura

has no direct transportation to the mainland and only nominal ferry service from the island of Islay to the west. It has little crofting due to a paucity of arable soil and maintains the more wage-based economy through a distillery and five lairds' estates. The Highlands and Islands Development Board assists the maintenance of each community. As in the past, Colonsay and Jura remain isolated from one another; public transportation does not exist between them.
With the cooperation of each island's physician, a demographic, genealogical, and medical survey was conducted on Colonsay and Jura during the summer of 1977. Name, age, sex,birthplace, and residence were collected for every inhabitant of each island. Additionally, interviews and a private medical proforma gathered native genealogies (later linked bycommon ancestry into onepedigree) and fam-

RESULTS
POPULATION COMPOSITION
Colonsay and Jura are composite populations of natives and immigrants. Complying with the population research of Morton et al. (1977, p. 249) on Barra island of the Outer Hebrides, this study also denned a native as one who has at least one parent born on that island. This operational definition excludes migrating spouses but includes the offspring of spatially exogamous marriages. On Colonsay and Jura such classification segregated the Gaelic-speaking adults and immediately prescribed a set of islanders who shared close genealogical relationships.

ulation pyramids and numerical compositions of Colonsay and Jura. Because human populations divide into three fertility cohorts based upon capacity to reproduce (Morton et al., 1971 p. 346), Tables 3 and 5 group the compositions into these age cohorts from the usual ages of first-born and last-born children of Colonsay and Jura females.
Colonsay and Jura share some similarities in population composition. Each population has an average age in the late 30's (Colonsay, 38.0 ± 23.6 years; Jura, 37.4 ± 24.7 years) and an overall sex ratio slightly in favor of females (Colonsay, 92.4M/ 100F; Jura, 93.6M/100F). Each population divides nearly equally into the respec-

tive fertility cohorts. The prereproductive cohort is the smallest fertility cohort on each island, possibly due to a small fertility dampening from the effective contraception now practiced by the women. The postreproductive cohorts have the largest proportions of native islanders because emigration seldom occurs during these years of life.
The internal sex ratio of the separate fertility cohorts follows a similar pattern on both islands: the postreproductive cohort heavily in favor of females (Colonsay, 50-90 + , 76.0M/100F; Jura, 50-90+, 69.8M/100F), the reproductive cohort in favor of males (Colonsay, 20-49,114.3M/ 100F; Jura, 20-49,128.1M/100F), and the

productive sex ratio in their favor. However, the work force of each island comes from the reproductive cohort and men prevail in this portion of the population. It is especially pronounced on Jura with the immigration of single males to work at the distillery and on the estates.

The proportion of natives to migrants portrays the principal contrast in composition between Colonsay and Jura. Colonsay has 81 of 127 (63.8 per cent) inhabitants with at least one parent born there--a ratio of nearly 2:1 in favor of natives. Jura has 74 of 211 (35.0 per cent) as native inhabitants--a ratio of 2:1 in favor of the migrants. The people of Colonsay have few wage-based employments; a similarly traditional economy on Holy island, Northumberland, England, does not attract immigrants and 100 of the 175 (57.2 per cent) inhabitants were still natives (Cartwright, 1973, p. 95). On the other hand, Jura'sfive estate owners compete for the tourist trade during its autumn hunting season. The estates frequently advertise on the mainland to fill positions. The distillery reopened in 1966 after a thirty-year closure to offer more jobs on the island. Although few native men of reproductive age participate in the wage economy, it has ample economic incentive for outsiders.
The varying opportunities for employment on Colonsay and Jura explain the one irregularity in the population pyramids: Colonsay's deficiency of young adults in the 20-29 age cohort. Many families of Colonsay have sons and daughters who emigrated after their early exposure to mainland life during high school. Recent emigrations for education and jobs

elsewhere involved 16 islanders 20-29 years of age (7M and 9F). If these young adults now lived on Colonsay, its population pyramid would exhibit a graduation of decreasing per cents through successive age cohorts like the composition of Jura with its wage economy. Emigration of the young adults has been noted for declining populations of Westray Island in the Orkneys (Coull, 1966, pp. 71-74), St. Kilda in the Outer Hebrides (Clegg, 1977, pp. 296-299), Holy island, Northumberland (Cartwright, 1973, p. 107), and Tory island, Donegal, Ireland (Fox, 1978, pp. 18-19).
POPULATION NUMBERS
Since populations are neither infinite nor constant in size, Wright (1931, 1938) proposed a population's "effective size" as its most meaningful unit of microevolution. To determine "effective size," one must first enumerate the breeding size of the census population. This can be the number of individuals of reproductive age or those in the population most likely to contribute viable offspring to their succeeding generation. As previously presented, Colonsay and Jura each have 34-35 per cent of their populations in the reproductive cohort of 20-49 years of age. A more efficient measure of the breeding size of a population is "the number of persons with children in the age of one

generation, i.e., from 0-30 years" (FreireMaia, 1974, p. 108). On Colonsay, 47 adults have children from 0-30 years old, or 37.0 per cent of the population. Seventy adults on Jura have children from 0-30 years old, or 33.2 per cent of the population.
The differences in their contribution of gametes to the next generation among immediate parents will reduce the population's breeding size to its effective size. Wright (1938) presented the formula
Nt = (4N-2)/(V+2)
to calculate effective size based upon the reproductive performances of immediate parents in a population. In the formula, TV represents the number of immediate parents and V is the variance in offspring produced per individual. Typically, a population will show a higher variance than mean in its offspring number, thus reducing the effective size to a still smaller segment than the breeding size (Bonne, 1963, p. 85). If the variance of family size equals its mean in a Poisson distribution, the effective size equals the breeding size (Freire-Maia, 1974, p. 109). The effective sizes for Colonsay and Jura were precisely calculated by "taking all individuals who were parents, . . . counting their total number of offspring, and then determining the mean and deviation in numbers of offspring for the total sample" (Swedlund, 1971, p. 15). This procedure accounts for single immediate parents. The 47 Colonsay parents (22 couples and 3 single parents) averaged 2.6 offspring/individual with a variance of 0.92; the effective size is 63.7, or 50.6 per cent of the Colonsay population. The 70 parents of Jura (33 couples and 4 single parents) have a mean of 2.4 offspring per individual with a variance of 1.75; the effective size equals 74.1,or 35.1 per cent of the Jura population.
The effective sizes on both Colonsay (50.6 per cent of N) and Jura (35.1 per

cent of N) exceed their respective breeding sizes (Colonsay, 37.0 per cent of N; Jura, 33.2 per cent of N) because the variance in gametic contribution of immediate parents is smaller than its mean. FreireMaia (1974, pp. 108-109) remarks that "a few examples of this situation have been found in man, but it has been impossible to verify, up to now, whether they represent real situations or are simply due to random fluctuation of estimates of the basic parameters." Certainly effective contraception practiced by the island adults reduces the natural variance of family size to a socially and economically appropriate number of children. On Jura the effective size just slightly exceeds its breeding size because the variance in adult contributions lies closer to the mean gametic contribution. The bulk of this variance comes from three migrant parents contributing far above the average number of offspring. Rather than inflating effective size, the excessive fertility of these migrants increased a reproductive variance that placed the effective size closer to the breeding size of Jura. However, Colonsay's discrepancy between its breeding size and a much larger effective size derives from a very low variance in adult reproductive performance. Effective contraception in a tiny island population without overwhelming immigration has accomplished this unexpected situation.
MIGRATION, MARRIAGE, AND FERTILITY
Morton (1973, p. 334) believes that "over a sufficiently small region, migration is a more important systematic pressure than mutation or selection." Its quantity and directions vary from area to area but seem especially susceptible to population density and economic opportunity afforded by available technology and transportation routes (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971, p. 430).

the numerical size and source of immigration to Colonsay and Jura, accounting for every migrant over the extant generations. As discussed in population composition, the absolute number of migrants to Jura as a proportion of its population is nearly twice that proportion on Colonsay. But the proportion and sources of immigration into Colonsay and Jura correspond. On each island the smallest yet similar proportion of migrants comes from neighboring Hebridean islands (Colonsay, 15.2 per cent of migrants; Jura, 11.0 per cent of migrants). Each island then has an intermediate number of English migrants (Colonsay, 37.0 per cent of migrants; Jura, 32.1 per cent of migrants). The largest proportion of migrants comes from the Scottish mainland (Colonsay, 47.8 per cent of migrants; Jura, 56.9 per cent of migrants), particularly from Glasgow where transportation networks originate.
Because "measuring the degree of endogamy is the relevant operation" in

definition of a population unit (Fix, 1979, p. 210), Table 7 lists the spatial marriage type for the reproductive and postreproductive couples on Colonsay and Jura. On each island the majority of couples is in the postreproductive generation. Unlike many reported island populations (e.g., Freire-Maia and Cavalli, 1978), the majority of matings on Colonsay and Jura are not endogamous. Although neither island constitutes a rigorous breeding population, they differ in their respective degree of departure from deme status. The proportion of marriages involving Colonsay natives (25.0 per cent endogamy and 62.5 per cent exogamy, 87.5 per cent total) doubles that proportion of marriages involving Jura natives (12.7 per cent endogamy and 31.8 per cent exogamy, 44.5 per cent total). Exogamy is the most numerous type of marriage on Colonsay while migrant couples prevail on Jura. The dissolutions of these two geographical isolates have followed similar patterns: The rates of marital admixture have increased

Colonsay has retained this trend in its reproductive generation but Jura has not. With increasing immigration to the islands, the next generations will not usually derive from native inhabitants.
The completed family represents the most vital unit of demographic analyses when estimating potential microevolution within and between human populations. The analyses of fertility on Colonsay and Jura use only couples from the postreproductive cohorts and couples from the reproductive cohorts who have not had a child in more than five years as indicative of completed family size. Tables 8 and 9 respectively record the completed fertility statistics for Colonsay and Jura. Each island has similar proportions of couples with completed family size (Colonsay, 26 of 32 couples, 81.2 per cent; Jura, 51 of 62 couples, 82.3 per cent) and similar numbers of endogamous and exogamous couples with completed family size (Colonsay, 25 endogamous and exogamous couples; Jura, 27 endogamous and exoga-

mous couples). On Colonsay, 20 of the 26 completed families (76.9 per cent) have the husband older than the wife while this proportion is 36 of the 51 completed families (70.6 per cent) on Jura.
No endogamous couple on either island is sterile and, in fact, they have the highest mean number of offspring per spatial marriage type. But Jura's overall mean number of offspring (1.9±1.6 offspring per completed family) is significantly lower (p = 0.05) than Colonsay's overall average (2.9±1.6 offspring per completed family). A shorter reproductive span (Jura, 3.7±4.4 years; Colonsay, 6.0±3.5 years) and a longer length of generation as measured by the wife's age at first child (Jura, 29.4±6.3 years; Colonsay, 25.8 ± 4.9 years) accompany Jura's reduced fertility.
The lower fertility on Jura first derives from an appreciable number of infertile exogamous (5) and migrant (6) couples; Jura's childless rate (11 of the 51 completed families, 21.6 per cent) is nearly twice that of Colonsay (3 of the 26 completed families, 11.5 per cent). Additionally, Jura has a higher proportion of completed families with only one child (11 couples, 21.6 per cent) than does Colon-

say (1 couple, 3.8 per cent). Late exogamous marriages on Jura play a role. Four of the five exogamous completed families with one child involved marriage past the spouses' ages of thirty and a subsequent wife's age at first birth past the age of 35. A delayed age at marriage carries the biological significance of delayed age at initial

childbearing with its concomitant shorter reproductive span (Bumpass and Mburugu, 1977).
NATIVE GENEALOGY AND INBREEDING
The collection of genealogical data from Colonsay and Jura natives (previously defined as inhabitants with at least

one parent born on that island) depended entirely upon their memories and oral tradition. They recalled remote male ancestors more frequently than remote female ancestors. Some natives naturally remembered, or wished to reveal, more than others. This methodology introduces a bias in excluding possible migrant inbreeding from the calculation of a population's total coefficient. However, the native pedigrees are comparable in depth and efficiency: (1) Each pedigree includes five generations (infrequently to six generations), and the oldest ancestors recalled are grandparents of the postreproductive natives; and (2) the native pedigree of Colonsay contains 65 of its 81 natives (80.2 per cent) while the native pedigree of Jura contains 65 of its 74 natives (87.8 per cent).
By individual native pedigree ascertainment converted to the arithmetic mean of the individual inbreeding coefficients (i.e.,/, the Malecot coefficient of inbreeding summarized by Reid, 1973, pp. 91-97), the inbreeding coefficient of Colonsay natives is 0.0023, or an average genealogical relationship near a third cousin once removed. On Jura the native inbreeding coefficient is 0.0044, or an average genealogical relationship near a third cousin. Regarding the aforementioned methodological bias of immigrant exclusion in pedigree linkage, the much larger migrant group to Jura could contain more inbred individuals but no migrant family to either island acknowledged any consanguinity.
Though exceeding the inbreeding coefficient of a British sample from the Orkney islands (f = 0.001834, Roberts et al., 1979, p. 392), both population inbreeding coefficients are low to moderate levels of human inbreeding (cf. Reid, 1973, pp. 98-99) and must be considered minimum estimates restricted by their 5-6 generation depth of genealogical data;

considerable remote consanguinity was further implied by surname concordance in individual pedigrees. Even the highest human population inbreeding coefficients measured by pedigree analysis barely surpass 0 (e.g.,/ = 0.0403 for the 1961 islanders of Tristan da Cunha, Roberts, 1967, p. 154). The pedigree method of allelic identity-by-descent designates most individuals in a population of limited genealogical data with separate inbreeding coefficients of 0. Therefore, the Malecot coefficient as a population mean usually has a modal value of 0 with low variance. As an example from Colonsay and Jura, each island native coefficient derived from the high (e.g., parents as first cousins) inbreeding coefficients of a few individuals (5 of 81 Colonsay natives, 6.2 per cent; 7 of 74Jura natives, 9.5 per cent). Native inbreeding on Colonsay and Jura may recall a more isolated historical past.
The native pedigree of Colonsay revealed that 45 (55.5 per cent) of the 81 natives have either MacNeill or MacPhee ancestry, the earliest surnames in island clan history; moreover, 28 natives (34.6 per cent) trace their ancestry to five "founders" of the immediately past generations. On Jura, 62 (83.8 per cent) of the 74 natives have either Buie or Shaw ancestry, recalling the earliest clan and family surnames there; 39 natives (52.7 per cent) trace their ancestry to just four "founders" of two couples.
Such common ancestry among an appreciable number of individuals in a population constitutes the founder effect. The founder effect is usually reported and perceived as apost hoc phenomenon of reproductive success. But Roberts (1968,1973, 1979) has meticulously measured the genetic effects of two census declines on the island population of Tristan da Cunha and discovered that considerable microevolution can occur at a nadir in numbers, or "bottleneck."

Today Colonsay and Jura are not rigorous breeding populations. Given 70-75 per cent native endogamy during 1841-1891 (Sheets, ms.), they are former geographical isolates in dissolution through an increasing marital admixture with immigrants most often from the Glasgow area. With each generation they attain closer genetic affinities to the mainland population of west Scotland. Jura's faster dissolution comes from its greater economic attractiveness to outsiders. Other isolate populations of Europe in Ireland (Crawford and Gmelch, 1974; Fox, 1978), Switzerland (Friedl and Ellis, 1974), and Poland (Berdychowski and Henneberg, 1978) exhibit similar trends toward dissolution as they economically integrate themselves with urban centers. Both Colonsay and Jura follow the modern tendency in Great Britain for increased interregional gene flow (Coleman 1977,1979).
Fix (1978, pp. 329-330) reviews "the almost embarrassing variety of mechanisms which may produce local genetic differentiation." But the relevance and the challenge of human genetic demography lie in explanation of biological and demographic data by cultural phenomena. For example, Clegg (1980) suggests the biological deprivations from parental unemployment may have maintained a high age of menarche for Outer Hebridean women born between 1920 to 1935. Human migration dictated in large part by Hebridean economics dominates the other forces of microevolution inferred by the

respective demographic structures of Col-
onsay and Jura islands. Subsequent re-
ports on the historical demography and
expanded native genealogies of Colonsay
and Jura will document the breakdown of
each local genetic isolation and hence
demonstrate how the conditions of 1977
reflect changes in population structures of
the past.
