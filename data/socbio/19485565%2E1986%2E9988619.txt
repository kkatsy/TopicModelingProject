ABSTRACT: In this paper we consider how family size and birth order may afiFect educational attainment and earnings. Family size may be important because if more children have to share parental financial, emotional, and time resources, each child may get less. Birth order may be important because of differences in endowments, parental resources over the life cycle, or parental preferences. We demonstrate how these different factors interact in a particular model.
Empirically we find both birth-order and family-size effects for schooling even when controlling for parental age, income, and education and father's religion. These effects are bigger for daughters than sons. Using the same controls, we do not find statistically significant family-size or birth-order effects for the In of earnings in a relatively young sample. We also present equations for how college was financed. Family size cuts down parental contribution per child and encourages working, scholarship, and loans. Results differ somewhat for sons and daughters.

In this paper we consider why birth order and sibship size may affect educational attainment of a child and subsequent adult earnings. We consider several not mutually exclusive theoretical models and present some empirical results drawn from our own work.
To aid in communication with an interdisciplinary audience, we begin by defining some terms. A person's earnings potential depends on the endogenous environment, which isthe time and money expenditures spent on the child's human capital (K), and on his or her endowments (E) which vary with genotype and the environment that parents treat as exogenous to their decisions regarding investment in their children. The expenditures and endowments are transformed into earnings potential via a production function which depends on both K and E. A person's utility function (U) indicates how various goods and services affect the person's welfare

or satisfaction. In our models, U depends on household or parental consumption (C) and on the future consumption = income (Y) of each child. The utility function is maximized subject to three constraints. The first is a budget constraint which says that household consumption plus expenditures on human capital plus financial bequests are equal to the parents' lifetime income. The second is the production function for earnings potential indicated above. The third, which is not always employed, is a time budget which says the sum of the individuals' time uses (including leisure) add up to their total time. From an economic viewpoint, important questions relate to how investment in children is chosen and the response of parents and children to different parameters of the utility function, prices, endowments, and perhaps number of children.

INVESTMENT AND PARENTAL UTILITY MAXIMIZATION
MODELS FOR DETERMINING DEMAND FOR EDUCATION
Economists have developed two basic general models to explain educational attainment. The older of these is the so-called investment model, which was elegantly derived by Becker (1967). In this model education makes an individual more productive and all returns to schooling are translatable into extra wages. It is generally assumed that each additional year of schooling adds ever smaller increments to earnings. In this model a person stops investing when the expected rate of return on the marginal investment in schooling equals the marginal interest rate. This model is vague on who makes decisions--the parents or the child--and does not indicate how parents allocate among children scarce resources such as funds for tuition.
To examine these issues economists have developed parental utility maximization models. Two special models, both nested in the more general model, have been examined in detail. Becker and Tomes (1976) assume that the parents' utility function contains terms defined as the sum of each child's earnings and income from financial bequests.1 The alternative model devel-

are nofinancialbequests, a common situation, but differ in an important respect if there are bequests.
In particular, both define compensating (reinforcing) behavior to occur when parents provide less (more) resources to purchase schooling to the child who is better endowed, i.e., has the greater E. In Becker and Tomes' model, a parent compensates (reinforces) if the earnings production function is such that the impact of investment in a child on potential earnings increases (declines) as the endowment of that child increases (i.e., 82Y/(dEdK) < 0 (> 0)). In contrast, in BPT's model, the parents' compensation decision depends on the extent of parental inequality aversion in theirutility function in addition to the nature of the production function. The BeckerTomes criterion does not hold in the BPT model.
In BPT (1982), we discuss the scanty evidence available to distinguish the Becker and Tomes' versus the BPT's model. We argued that existing results tend to support our model, a conclusion that subsequently has been reinforced by Menchik (1984), but the issue is far from settled. In the rest of this paper we use our version of the parental utility maximizing model.

weigh more heavily equal outcomes for that child than for a sibling.
Three such hypothetical indifference curves are given in Figure 1. First we consider the curvature of these curves. The straight line A\BA2 illustrates the case in which the parents are indifferent to the distribution of potential earnings among their children and only care about the sum of their children's earnings. This is a pure investment case. The right angle BiBB2 illustrates the other Rawlsian extreme of pure inequality concern, in which parents obtain increased utility from providing more earnings to the better endowed sib only after the other child has the same potential earnings as this sib. Other indifferences curves, like C\BCi, fall between these extremes and indicate differing degrees of tradeoffs between equity and investment concerns in the parental utility function.
Now we consider the location of the lines relative to a 45°ray from the origin. In Figure 1 the curves are symmetrical

around the 45° ray. This means the parents exhibit equal concern or that the parents weigh equally in their preferences equal outcomes for the two children. For a given distribution of expected earnings outcomes between two children, say $20,000 per year for one child and $25,000 for the other, the parents are indifferent about which child receives which earnings level. In Figure 2, however, the curve with the intermediate curvature has been moved to the right so that it no longer is symmetrical around the 45° ray line. A move to the right means that parentsfavor child one over child two. The parents clearly prefer a distribution of $25,000 per year to child one and $20,000 to child two over the opposite. The parents exhibit unequal concern, in this case favoring child one.
Whatever the curvature and location of a representative parental indifference curve, a particular household will have a whole set of these curves, as is indicated in Figure 3. Since higher levels of expected earnings of their children reasonably can be assumed to improve paren-

The economic problem of the parents is how to allocate the resources under their control in order to have a combination of expected earnings between child one and two which is on the highest pos-

earnings combinations possible for the children of this family given the resources devoted to investment in the children's education, the children's endowments, and the resource constraints.

ment of one child were larger relative to that of the other child, the frontier would be skewed further out for the former child. Note that DiD2 is curved because we are assuming diminishing returns to schooling. The maximization subproblem is solved by finding the highest indifference curve tangent to D1D2. This is shown at JVin Figure 5.
Within the context of this model, birth-order effects can occur because of systematic differences either in DiD2 or in the indifference curves. The points D\ and D2 depend on endowments, resources devoted to children's education that reflects parental income, and the price of a year of schooling. Endowments may vary on average with birth order because older mothers are more likely to have children with birth defects and may allocate resources differently.3 Family income and the amount saved for education fluctuate over time, often in an unforseen manner. In addition, future expected parental increases in earnings may not be good collateral.4 Hence, older children may find it more costly to raise funds for college. The tuition price of schooling also may vary over time, especially if the government introduces or greatly alters various scholarship and subsidy programs.5
Lindert (1977) has argued that the oldest child benefits by having some period of exclusive attention from his or her mother during which she improves his or her stock of human capital. Available evidence from time budget studies suggests that he is correct about mother's time spent with each child. For instance, Liebowitz (1972) provides some

evidence that parental time matters for males in the top 2 per cent of the IQ distribution. We note that Lindert ignores the possibility that a mother may be as effective in reading one story to twochildren as to one. Lindert's argument, moreover, does not rule out Zajonc's (1972) model in which general household intellectuality and teaching of younger by older children play important roles, primarily to the advantage of the first born. Without too much stretching, we can think of all of these possibilities as equivalent to an increase in endowments in our general model. Suppose, for example, that birth-order production effects effectively increase the endowments of child one while leaving those of child two unaltered, as in the dashed earnings possibility frontier in Figure 6. As is illustrated, the earnings possibility frontier moves out (except at D2), which leads to a new equilibrium at a higher level of parental satisfaction at X' at which the expected earnings of child one definitely is increased. The expected earnings of child

two may be higher, lower, or the same-- depending on the exact movement in the earnings production frontier and the curvature in the parental indifference curves. Except in the extreme case of Rawlsian right-angle parental indifference curves, however, the expected earnings of child one increases relative to that of child two to the hypothetical birth-order-associated effective endowment change favoring child one.
Birth-order differences also may exist due to the locations of the parental indifference curves relative to the 45° ray. Suppose that parents are faced with a given earnings possibility frontier, but exhibit unequal concern that favors child one. The rightward shifted indifference curves due to this birth-order preference causes a higher expected earnings for child one and lower expected earnings for child two, as compared with the case of parental equal concern.
Of course there may be both production and preference effects of birth order, in which case the final outcome depends upon whether the two effects work in the same or opposite direction,

and--in the latter case--which dominates.
The interrelationships between sibship size and the average quantity and quality of schooling attainment have been considered by a number of economists.6 Most argue that for given income children in larger families receive lower quantity and quality of schooling.7 This standard outcome can be determined using the concepts and diagrams previously introduced. The greater the number of siblings the closer D\Di is to the origin and each child receives less schooling.8 The shape of the utility and production functions would determine how the overall schooling reduction is shared.
AN EXAMPLE WITH EXPLICIT FUNCTIONAL FORMS FOR THE BPT PARENTAL MAXIMIZATION
MODEL
In previous work, we have examined a model with particular functional forms that allow us to obtain closed-form expressions for the within-family ratios of schooling and earnings.
We use a utility function of the form
· (1)
6 See, for example, Becker and Tomes (1976) and Willis (1973).
7 There is also a large body of empirical findings that indicate a negative relationship between sibship size and years of schooling and adult earnings (Behrman et al., 1980, provide a recent summary). In BPT (1984a) we also demonstrate that members of larger sibships are less similar to one another in terms of education completed. We speculated that this occurs because children in larger families rely less on parental wealth and more on other financing sources which have more individual specific variation. We present some results which confirm these arguments.
8In BPT (1984) we demonstrate that if the utility function is Ea(Y--b)c, then b may exert an offsetting influence. However, we always have found b empirically to be near zero.

the price of schooling divided by the price of parental consumption, parental income, the child's endowment, and the parameters of the utility and the production function. We have argued earlier that the birth order and family size effects can operate through several of these mechanisms. Thus, we can not determine the source of the interhousehold differences in birth order or family size from the reduced form. While it is possible to obtain an explicit demand function, it is a very complicated one; hence, in the interhousehold analyses we use linear and semilogarithmic approximations.
EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES OF BIRTH-ORDER AND
FAMILY-SIZE EFFECTS
We now turn to some new and recent empirical results based on the NASNRC Twin and Adult Offspring Sample. The Twin Sample has been described in detail in Behrman et al. (1980). Briefly, it contains data on some 1,000 pairs of identical and 900 pairs of fraternal twins, all white male veterans born between 1917 and 1927.10 They have been surveyed several times. Around 1980 we asked them to provide names and addresses of their adult offspring to enable us to survey the children. We have about 4,000 children who responded to our questionnaire and we have school transcripts, obtained with signed releases, for about 30 per cent of these.
The birth-order information comes

This question is 95 per cent accurate for a subsample of this sample for which blood tests provide a practically definitive identification.

from the father. The 1980 roster indicates when there are stepparents. In the analysis that follows we have excluded children with stepparents though we would include some of their half siblings. We also include in our analysis measures of family background since Ernst and Angst (1984) make a compelling case that such treatment is necessary. We note that coefficient of sibship size may be biased because it may be chosen simultaneously with the allocations to children. We find that exclusion of family size increases in absolute value the magnitude of the birth-order effects.
In (1985) we report in more detail the results summarized in Table 1 for years of schooling and for In earnings. We initially used a set of mutually exclusive birth order dummies and found that the coefficients declined approximately in a linear fashion. To save space, we present here the results using the number of children in the family. The regressions control for the age of each parent when that child was born, father's education, mother's education, parental earnings, and father's religion. Since similar results are obtained from the two representations, we discuss here only the ones obtained using the continuous representation.
For females, the coefficient on birth order in the schooling relation is a highly significant -0.37. This sample has a goodly number of fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-born children. The difference between first and fifth-born, even controlling for family background and number of siblings, is close to one-and-a-half years of schooling, a huge difference. The coefficient on the number of sibs plus one is -0.05, which is not statistically significant (though in the dummy variable representation this coefficient is larger and significant at the 10per cent

ings (adjusted for age), we do not find either birth order or number of siblings to be significant in the equations for In earnings for males or females. However, for females, the dummy variables are close to being significant if number of siblings is not included. Here the controls matter more.

INTRAFAMILY ALLOCATIONS AND HOUSEHOLD SIZE
Estimation of Equations (4) and (5) would let us obtain unbiased estimates of the parameters in our model. We have not yet made these estimates because some necessary data only recently have been obtained. However, in BPT (1982, 1985) and elsewhere we have shown that it is possible to manipulate our model to obtain

Pi a2 T 2 '

(6)

Unfortunately, since both schooling and earnings are choice or dependent variables estimates of parameters from (6) may be biased. In BPT (1985), we show that c is biased upward when we estimate Equation (6). Since we generally find our estimate of c to be small and positive, it seems clear that c is not one and thus parents have some concern over earnings inequality of their offspring.

It is possible that different types of families have different values of c. We estimate a new version of Equation (6) in which we make c a linear function of family size:

In A = (0.023 + 0.0002 Family Size) (7) S2 (2.1) (ol)
(In Zl) -0.025 First Born. Y2 (4.9)

Family size has a small coefficient that is nowhere near being statistically significant. The coefficient on First Born, however, is statistically significant and indicates that parents either give more weight (prefer) later born children or school prices are higher for first born.
FINANCING OF SCHOOLING
We also have some information on how number of siblings and birth order affect the financing of schooling. The financing sources are work, scholarship, parents, loans, and other. The students were asked to give the percentage distribution for each source. We know the college attended for about 1,000 students and of these we have data on parental income for about 80 per cent. These students have similar means on family background and own earnings and schooling as those students in the sample for whom the particular college attended is not known.
The students went to college in different years. To standardize prices, we collected the tuition and room and board data for 1975. The estimates for the funding sources for a year of college are given in Table 2.
Since this type of data is not often available, we first briefly describe the coefficient estimates for the various controls. For one year of college expenses, father's education is not statistically significant, but mother's education is significant and positive in both the total cost column and in the funds provided by the parents column. Family income is an important variable in the various funding sources columns. The greater the parents' income the less the students rely on working, scholarships, and loans and the more they rely on parents, but in the total column, the coefficient has a

"t" statistic of only 1.2 in Table 2. Father's religion does not have significant effects, though Behrman et al. (1980) find strong effects on the father's own education and Inearnings.

The age of the father at the birth of the particular child has significant quadratic impacts on the use of scholarships. The peak impact is at father's age of about 30 at the child's birth and 48at

the age of the child's college matriculation. The latter age for the father is approximately the age at which earnings profiles in a cross-section have peaked for more highly educated people. Daughters rely significantly lesson loans and receive more funds from parents than sons.
Now we turn to the family-size and birth-order effects. There are some interesting family-size effects. In Table 2, the larger one's family, the more heavily one relies on scholarships and loans and the less heavily on parental contributions. The difference between having zero and four siblings is $260 in scholarships, $300 in loans, and nearly $800less from the parents per year. In these yearly cost estimates, however, none of the birth-order dummies are significant.
The cost figures weighted by years attended college are not shown since the same pattern exists for family size as in Table 2. The impact of a change from zero to four siblings is about $1,000 in extra scholarship aid, $850 in extra loans, and a $3,000 smaller parental contribution. The birth-order dummies tend to have larger "t" statistics than in Table 2 and the first born have significantly more total or gross expenditures.
CONCLUSIONS
It is possible to model theoretically the relationship between schooling, earnings, and other child and adult outcomes on the one hand and birth order and sibship size on the other. Sibship size often is thought to affect the amount

of monetary and time resources available to each child. While demand for some goods, such as beer, are known to decline as income rises, we would expect a positive income effect for schooling and earnings. The empirical evidence supports this view.

Birth-order effects can arise because

of differences in preferences, genetic

endowments, teaching opportunities, or

availability of parents time. In our data

set, birth-order effects are found for

both schooling and the In of earnings in

the raw data. Once we control for family

background and the sibship size, the

earnings data no longer display birth-

order effects but the schooling data do,

The difference between first and fifths

born is 0.7 years for males and a huge

1.4 years for women.

·

Sibship size also increases reliance,on scholarships and loans and reduces parental support for each child in college^. In the source of funding estimates, the only significant birth-order effect is found in the total expenditure for all, years equation, though the lack of significance elsewhere may be due to the small sample size. The first born spends about $3,000 more in this case.
