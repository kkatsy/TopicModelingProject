Is Lactation Nature's Contraceptive? Data from Samoa
Maureen H. Fitzgerald
Pacific Basin Rehabilitation Research and Training Center John A. Burns School of Medicine University of Hawaii at Manoa Honolulu, Hawaii
ABSTRACT: Data from a Samoan menstruation study suggest that lactation, even intensive on-demand lactation, does not inhibit menstruation or conception. This paper explores the applied and theoretical implications of continuing to accept lactation as a universally effective fertility control mechanism. Such thinking can have disastrous implications for family planning programs, and it keeps us from challenging long-held assumptions about lactation's role in population growth in early populations.
While most professionals realize Laukaran andWinikoff, 1985; Internalactation is only one of several mech- tional Planned Parenthood Federaanisms involved in population regula- tion, 1987; Kennedy et al., 1989). tion (e.g., contraception, abortion, in- There is, however, a debate being fanticide, postpartum sex taboos), waged over whether or not lactation is many continue to assume that lactation an effective contraceptive; and,if itis, plays a primary role, especially in or was, then what is the primary mechThird World populations (e.g., Short, anism involved (see for example: 1976,1984; Anderson, 1983; Huffman, Hodgson, 1985; Dobbing, 1982; Nardi, 1984; Biddulph, 1985; Laukaran and 1981).

and Mayer, 1953) and European and American Caucasian populations (e.g., Liestol, 1988; Smith, 1985; Howie and McNeilly in Short, 1984; Salber et al., 1966), this debate is based on data from populations with marginal or fluctuating levels of nutrition (e.g., Howell, 1976, 1979; Hodgson, 1985; Ford and Huffman, 1988), small stature (e.g., Chowdhury, 1978, and Huffman et al., 1978a,b) or ones which routinely utilize other fertility regulating methods. The debate incorporates little information for non-Western, healthy, robust populations, and little from the South Pacific (Lucas and Ware, 1981).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This paper does not consider in detail again the debate that has been explored at length elsewhere (for extensive reviews of this literature, see, for example, Harrell, 1981; Hodgson, 1985; Short, 1976, 1984; Frisch, 1983, 1985, 1987; Anderson, 1983; Nardi, 1982; Huffman, 1984), but it does contribute to the debate by offering information on one robust, healthy, nonWestern population. It is based on information collected in rural Western Samoa, the more modernistic American Samoa, and urban Honolulu, Hawaii, during 1986-87 as part of a Samoan menstrual experience study conducted in conjunction with a University of Hawaii Samoan Health Project. As lactation and its contraceptive effect were not the primary subject of my research (see Fitzgerald, 1989, 1990), this material must be considered preliminary and only suggestive. Nevertheless, I feel it forces us to reassess our assumptions about lactation and its

role in the suppression of menses and ovulation and thus its importance as a primary factor in population regulation amongst all populations, both in the present and the past.
I began to question my assumption about the role of lactation in the suppression of menses shortly after I arrived in American Samoa, our first fieldwork site. Following an in-service presentation on menstruation at the LBJ Tropical Medical Center, a woman came up to me and asked if it was.possible to get pregnant or menstruate while a woman was breastfeeding. As we talked I learned that, much to her surprise, in spite of the fact she was breastfeeding on-demand, she had gotten pregnant when her baby was only a couple of months old. She also knew of others who had a similar experience. Soon thereafter I learned that some of the Health Project subjects had resumed menses a month after childbirth.
When we went to rural Western Samoa, the district doctor told me that rural Samoan women rarely come to the clinic about menses-related issues. One of the few times they come is if they have not begun to menstruate within a few months after giving birth, a condition they think is unusual. He also told me he has difficulty getting many Public Health nurses to institute family planning, with the women who want it, before their first menses postpartum. As a result, because ovulation can occur before the resumption of menses, many of these women get pregnant.
Other data offer further evidence that intensive on-demand lactation, at least among Samoans, does not always suppress ovulation or menses. Because

fants are fed on demand until they are satisfied, and they are offered the breast whenever they cry (see alsoKinloch, 1985; Nardi, 1984). Infant feeding data collected by Daniggelis (1987) in this village corroborate my impressions. Children may nurse until they are two or three years old with the average being about 13 months. They usually sleep with their mother at least until they are weaned, and supplemental feedings are introduced when the child is 5-6 months old. According to Daniggelis, the average age for the introduction of other foods is 6.4 months.

According to the women in my study, breastfeeding begins within the firsttwenty-four hours, usually within a couple of hours, unless the mother, midwife, or family feels there is a problem with the milk. For example, if the mother's milk is deemed insufficient, the infant may receive supplements in the form of coconut milk or supo (soup) for a few days until the mother can produce sufficient milk. During this period the infant may also be nursed periodically by another lactating woman. This situation is reported to be the unusual case. Nardi (1984, p. 179) reports that some mothers in

to ask how to prepare formula. They had just come from the clinic where they were told they needed to give formula to a baby staying in their home. They had no idea what to do. They had never prepared formula, were unable to read the English directions, and had nothing with which to measure the formula.

When asked if they offer supplements at all before the introduction of solid food, women in my study reported that they felt there wasno need.

Breastfeeding was viewed as sufficient for most infants. Again, they reported that supplements were only given if the mother did not seem to have sufficient milk or could not breastfeed for some reason. Unlike other areas of Samoa (Nardi, 1984), bottle feedings are not used as supplemental feedings.
Based on information from my informants, my observations of Samoan infant feeding practices, and material available in the literature (e.g., Nardi, 1984; Daniggelis, 1987), I feel confident in stating that, at least in this village, Samoan women practice intensive on-demand breastfeeding twentyfour hours a day. As Nardi (1984, p. 279) observed, mothers are seldom far from their infants during the first few months. They may occasionally leave the baby in another's care but rarely for more than an hour or two before the age of four or five months.
SEXUAL BEHAVIOR DURING LACTATION
According to historical documents, Samoans practiced abstinence during lactation (Schoeffel, 1979; Mageo, personal communication). Two of my respondents in Hawaii (one male and one female) also report this abstinence. According to their explanation, if the woman engages in regular intercourse, her milk will spoil. However, in Western Samoa I was told that people do not always abstain, and, in some cases, coitus may occur shortly after childbirth. One woman claims she has heard that some couples go to a stream after childbirth to bathe and have sex. This practice has been recorded for the Marquesas (Suggs, 1966,and personal communication, 1990). This same woman suggests that some husbands want, and may even demand, sex

within the first few days after childbirth.
According to Nardi (1985, p. 280), people in the village where she worked believe sex can affect breastmilk bythe introduction of germs, an explanation obviously influenced by exposure to Western medicine. Using this explanation, women claim they can use breastfeeding as a form of birth control, in that husbands can be coaxed into abstaining from sex because of their concern for their babies health.
POSTPARTUM AMENORRHEA
One doctor in rural Western Samoa estimates that 75-80 per cent of all women in the area begin menstruating within three months of delivery. This estimate includes, however, women who also bottlefeed as there are some women in the larger villages along the highway who do bottlefeed. A maternity nurse in American Samoa reports that most women she knows in American Samoa, both those who breastfeed and those who bottlefeed, resume menses after one month, and it is not uncommon for women to have two births within a single year.
Formal and informal interview data suggest that resumption of regular menses within three months is very common and within one month is not unusual.2 This finding is consistent with the clinical experience with Sa-
2Kennedy et al. (1989) state in their consensus statement that all bleeds before 56 days (eight weeks) can be ignored as a "normal postpartum bleed." Since I had never heard of such bleeds being considered as a normal postpartum event, I spoke to Dr. Ralph Hale, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the John A. Burns School of Medicine. According to Dr. Hale, any postpartum bleed up to eight weeks would, in his opinion, be a matter of concern, and it would be very difficult to distinguish such bleeding from the onset of menses.

moan and Hawaiian women of an obstetrician/gynecologist in Hawaii (Hale, personal communication, 1990) and data from the United States (Hodgson, 1985). Using information on the shortest period of amenorrhea for any of their children for 13 mothers in my Western Samoan sample, 38.5 per cent had started menstruating when the baby was roughly a month old; 53.7 per cent were menstruating by the time the baby was three months old; and 76.8 per cent were menstruating by the time the baby was six months old. Only one woman reports ever having had postpartum amenorrhea that extended over a year. This woman has three children. For the first, her amenorrhea lasted one year; for the second, one year and two months; and for the third, ten months. One woman reported resumption of menses at three weeks. Her menses began while I was living in the village, and she came to tell me when she started because she was aware of my interest. Thus, the shortest period reported was three weeks, and the longest period was one year and two months.3
In American Samoa, the three breastfeeding women who participated in the menstruation study reported resumption of menses within one month. While it is quite possible the infants
3Knodel et al. (1985, p. 308) have suggested that the use of injectables, what Samoan women call "injections," may lead some women to report they are still in a state of postpartum amenorrhea when it is actually the by-product of the medication. While injectables are used in Western Samoa, I do not think their use is an issue for any of the women considered here because my information indicates that those using "injections" started them after resumption of menses.

were given supplemental feedings or sucklings in the form of water, KoolAid, or a pacifier, as these are commonly seen in American Samoa, this is highly unlikely in at least one case. One of the women was frequently observed by Project staff, and we have little doubt that she was intensively lactating and was not offering anything other than the breast. She frequently talked with another staff member about how much she loved breastfeeding her children. The day we did the menstruation interview, she reported that her period started a few hours before I arrived. She thought it was quite an amusing coincidence; I thought it was interesting because on that day her baby was a month and a day old. She reports that her first child was also just a month old at first postpartum menses.
I must suggest caution with this data, even though Holland (1987) reports there is probably little distortion in retrospective data on such related issues as duration of breastfeeding. All estimates on resumption of menses are based on the age of the child at that time. While many children were less than two years old at the time of the interview, and several were less than one year old, in other cases the children were several years old. Furthermore, the answers may indicate some Samoan cultural belief about the ideal time for menses to resume, and this must be considered in future research. Nevertheless, even if we assume the information is not completely accurate and may be off by a month or more, we still find that most women in Western Samoa resume menses before six months, and many even earlier, even when they intensively lactate.

tion. The Samoan social system (including alofa [love or caring] and fa'alavelave [a social institution which draws on community resources]) helps insure that all Samoans' basic nutritional needs are met. The traditional Samoan diet is high in fat, most of which comes from the ubiquitous use of coconut cream. Samoans are well recognized as being very robust. They have been identified as one of the heaviest groups of people in the world (Pawson and Janes, 1981; Bindon, 1984; Crews, 1989). The average weight for all females in our Western Samoa sample (including those who have never been pregnant, n = 25) is 65 kg (143 pounds) (s.d., 2.76), average height of 161.3 cm (s.d., 0.96), and average BMI (body mass index) is 24.95 (s.d., 0.93). Weight and BMI, but not height, are significantly higher in American Samoa and Hawaii. These measurements are consistent with other studies of Samoans (Baker et al., 1986).
Frisch (1980, p. 26) states, "The well-nourished human female, particularly on a diet with a high percentage of calories from fat, may have higher estrogen levels, which result in a higher reproductive efficiency than is found in females with less adiposity." According to the nutrition/body composition theory, lactation imposes a very high energy demand. Thus, a poorly nourished woman or one with a minimal store of body fat should be expected to have a longer period of amenorrhea and anovulation than a well-nourished or robust woman (Frisch, 1975, 1985, 1987; Hodgson, 1985).
The second school of thought claims that in order to suppress ovulation and menses, breastfeeding must be inten-

sive, namely there must be frequent, regular stimulation through breastfeeding (see, for example, Jelliffe and Jelliffe, 1982; Anderson, 1983; Huffman, 1984). This means that the infant must have free access to the mother's breast both during the day and at night. The early introduction of food supplements would decrease the need to suckle and therefore the level of prolactin would be decreased--below the level needed for suppression. Bongaarts (1985) suggests that the duration of lactation (number of months involved) is more important than caloric intake.
CONCLUSION
Like Hodgson (1985, p. 36), I would argue that assumptions about the contraceptive function of lactation "could have wide-ranging and perhaps disastrous effects on family planning programs around the world." As Dobbing (1982, p. 1725) suggests, lactation seems to be an inefficient contraceptive at the individual level (see also Smith, 1985) and "manifestly inadequate" at the population level.
Too many places, including rural areas of underdeveloped countries, maintain high rates of growth in spite of prolonged and intensive breastfeeding. Sometimes the rate of growth is even higher than in neighboring urban areas where breastfeeding is declining (Nardi, 1981, p. 36; Dobbing, 1982). Lactation is probably only effective as a contraceptive if the woman is malnourished or has minimal fat stores (Hodgson, 1985;see also Frisch, 1975), and in populations only when this is the common case. Thus, the same policy about when to introduce birth control

62

can not be used for all nations. I would also argue that these assumptions have important ramifications for conjectures about fertility and population growth over hominid history (see also Frisch, 1988).
Although my data are preliminary and need to be expanded and refined in future research, they suggest that women in rural Samoa breastfeed intensively enough to produce levels of prolactin to suppress menses if prolactin level is the necessary and sufficient condition for postpartum amenorrhea. However, breastfeeding does not appear to suppress their menses nor ovulation. On the other hand, they have sufficient and, in many cases, more than sufficient levels of fat, and, although anemia is not uncommon (Wood and Gans, 1981), they are generally healthy and well-nourished.
Many studies (e.g., Harrell, 1981; Nardi, 1984) suggest that lactating women in urban and modernized societies begin to menstruate and ovulate earlier than their urban or preindustrialized counterparts because of changes in infant feeding practices (i.e., scheduled breastfeeding, early addition of supplements). While this may be true in some cases, we must also consider other changes, including changes in body composition from either improved health and nutrition (Lunnetal., 1981;Frisch, 1987) or sedentary lifestyle and changes in sexual practices, namely a decrease in adherence to postpartum sex taboos.
If, however, most pre-industrial or pre-historic populations lived in adequate, or even lush environments, rather than the marginal environments of so many contemporary hunters and gatherers (Lee and DeVore, 1979,

p. 5), we can suggest that lactation may have played a minor contraceptive or population regulation role in these populations. As Lee and DeVore (1979, p. 5) have pointed out: "Taking hunters as they are found, anthropologists have naturally been led to the conclusion that their life (and by implication the life of our ancestors) was a constant struggle for survival." If, rather, our ancestors generally had adequate fat stores and lactated on demand, like contemporary robust Samoans, then lactation's potential contraceptive feature may have only been of value in periods of crisis.
Thus, lactation or female biology would only come into play as a contraceptive when the mother's very survival would be seriously threatened by pregnancy. This suggests a more reasonable and adaptive relationship between the physical environment and biology (see also Frisch, 1987, p. 529) and suggests that social behavior, such as the use of "unnatural" contraceptives, infanticide, sex taboos, etc., is more critical for controlling population size than female biology.
To continue to believe that lactation is Nature's contraceptive can have disastrous effects, especially for populations like Samoans and those where modernization is having a positive impact on health and nutrition. It is clear that we need to reeducate family planning personnel that lactation, particularly in these populations, is not sufficient to suppress ovulation. To continue to believe and to continue to promote the belief that lactation is an effective natural contraceptive is simply too risky for the women involved. It is also unfair to these women for it keeps from them information they
