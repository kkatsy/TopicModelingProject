Lewis, childlessness is presently declining in Canada also. A comparison of young women aged 30 to 44 with women over the age of 45 indicates that in every instance the rate of childlessness is lower among the young wives than among the women of completed childbearing, controlling for rural-urban residence and for province (Table 1). The incidence of childlessness might be expected to eventually decline still further, as at least some of these women may bear a child in the ten to fifteen years remaining before the onset of the menopause.
Although a number of demographers have noted the decrease in the incidence of childlessness, few have attempted to explain this phenomenon. One hypothesis which has been suggested, and which

Thompson and Lewis (196S) believe to be
correct, is that the decline in childlessness
can be attributed to the general decline in
age at first marriage. The correlation be-
tween an early age at first marriage for
women and low rates of childlessness has been repeatedly demonstrated2 (Grabill
and Glick, 1959; Mitra, 1966). It has also
often been observed that both the age at
first marriage and the incidence of child-
lessness have been declining in the last two
2 In 1961, of all Canadian women ever married, 96.13% were married before the age of 35. For women aged 30-44, 98.55% had married before age 35, compared with 92.28% for women over 45. An earlier analysis of Canadian census data suggests that at least for women who marry before the age of 35, most of the variation in childlessness by age at first marriage can be attributed to psychological rather than physiological factors (Veevers, 1971).

* 1961 Canadian census, women ever-married, age 30 and older. t Up to the age of 45, the longer the duration of marriage, the lower the rate of childlessness. After ten years, the difference is in the expected direction but is very smalL For women under 45, the age categories are adjusted for a minimum length of marriage of ten years.

decades. If the hypothesis were correct, it would be expected that women who were married for the first time at comparable ages would have comparable rates of childlessness, assuming that other relevant factors such as rural-urban residence and duration of marriage were held constant. Census data were analyzed to test this hypothesis. As shown in Table 2, rates of childlessness tend to vary with age, even when age at first marriage is held constant. In all instances, the rates of childlessness among young women under the age of 45 are lower than among middle-aged women aged 45 to 64. In most instances, although the rates of childlessness of old women over the age of 65 are not as low as for women who have not yet completed meno-

pause, they are lower than the rates for the middle-aged group.
The question of why the rates of childlessness are declining in Canada and the United States has not yet been satisfactorily answered. Whatever the reasons for this trend, it is suggested that although the falling age at first marriage may account for some of the variance, it is not in itself an adequate explanation. Age at first marriage and rates of childlessness do show concomitant variation. However, it is premature to suggest, as Thompson and Lewis have done, that childlessness is declining because the average age at marriage is declining. Most likely, both changes can be attributed to some other, as yet unidentified, variable.
