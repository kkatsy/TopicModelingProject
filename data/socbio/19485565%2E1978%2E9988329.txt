ABSTRACT: Own-children fertility estimates derived from the Korean censuses of 1966 and 1970 indicate that the total fertility rate fell by more than half a child in the intercensal period, from an estimated 4,837 to 4,257 per thousand. A compositional analysis shows that about one-fourth of the fall can be attributed to changes in population composition by urban-rural residence, education, marital status, and parity, and about three-fourths to changes in age-specific birth rates cross-classified by these same characteristics. The own-children method is used to generate the finely specified birth rates necessary for this analysis, and a decomposition technique used previously by one of the authors is extended to incorporate the unusually large number of compositional variables.

The Korean total fertility rate fell sharply during the 1960's, from an estimated 5,955 in 1960(Cho, 1974)to 4,257 in 1970. Conforming to a pattern common in developing nations where a fertility transition has clearly begun (Kirk, 1971), this rapid and sustained fertility decline was both preceded and accompanied by rapid mortality decline and economic development. Sustained mortality decline began in the mid-1950's, with life expectancy rising from 52 years in 1955-60 to 64 years in 1971 (Cho, 1973). Per capita income, at current prices and exchange rates, increased at an average rate of 5.0 per cent between 1960 and 1970, rising from U.S. $146 (a comparatively low level for fertil-

socioeconomic characteristics also evolved rapidly over the 1960's, and it is on the fertility impact of this evolution that the present paper focuses. The aim is to decompose the change in the total fertility rate between 1966 and 1970 into two sets of contributions, one from changes in population composition byurban-rural residence, education, marital status, and parity, and the second from changes in age-specific fertility cross-classified by these same characteristics. Thefinelyspecified birth rates necessary for this analysis are computed by a recent extension of the own-children method (Retherford and Cho, in press) as applied to the Korean censuses of 1966 and 1970.

The decomposition method used here is an extension of a technique used in an earlier study which sought to measure the contributions of three factors--changing age composition, marital status composition, and age-specific marital fertility--to decline in the Korean crude birth rate between 1960 and 1970 (Retherford and

* Dramatic changes of rates in some categories, particularly at ages 15-19, are probably due to small numbers of sample births and consequent high sampling variability. For reasons of space, the parity variable is omitted from the table. Decompositions are calculated from values more exact than those shown in the table.

for 1966 and values of kxre for 1970. The quantity (TFR* - TFR(l9e6}), taken as a percentage of TFRTMm - TFRlTM6\ is then the contribution of change in educational composition to the overall change in the TFR. Contributions from changes in residence composition, marital status composition, parity composition, and fertility are similarly obtained.
Unfortunately, this alternative decomposition is not strictly additive. It contains a residual term obtained by subtracting the sum of the earlier terms from 100 per cent. The presence of this residual term means that numerical contributions in this decomposition generally differ from those in the decomposition based on Equation (3). Nevertheless, the relative importance of the several contributions is the same in both decompositions as illustrated in Table 2. Decompositions based on Equation (3) are preferred because they do not contain residual terms.

Movement of persons from one compositional category to another, say rural to urban, itself influences category-specific fertility, because, in general, movers do not assume instantaneously the fertility behavior of their new category of membership.
A final caution in interpreting the decompositions is that the fertility contribution to change in the TFR cannot be interpreted as a family planning program contribution. This fact becomes clear when one considers that addition of more compositional variables into the analysis (say, occupation and income) might substantially alter the size of the fertility contribution. Moreover, over time, the fertility implications of membership in a given compositional category may change owing to changes in social context. For example, the bearing of a primary school education on occupational mobility, which in turn bears on fertility, changes considerably as

RESULTS
The Korean TFR declined from anestimated 4,837 to 4,257 per thousand between 1966 and 1970 (see Table 1). Table 3 decomposes this change into components, following theprocedure specified by Equation (3) in theprevious section.
The first-order decomposition in Table 3 includes only urban-rural residence as a compositional variable. Changes in residence composition contributed 25.2 per cent of the decrease in the TFR, and changes in age-specific fertility within residence categories contributed 74.8 per cent. The 16.9 percent decline in the rural TFR (from 5,793 to 4,814, as shown in Table 1)dominated the 74.8 percent fertility contribution. Theurban TFR actually increased by 8.6 per cent (from 3,298 to 3,581).

may have judged the period an especially propitious time to add to their families. Such a hypothesis is in line with theexperience of Western countries, where short-term economic fluctuations have often induced short-term fertility fluctuations in the same direction, superimposed on the secular fertility decline. The comparatively high fertility of newly arrived rural-urban migrants no doubt also contributed toincrease urban fertility.
The second-order decomposition in Table 3 indicates education as well as residence as compositional variables, with education introduced after residence. The introduction of education splits the 74.8 per cent fertility contribution in thefirstorder decomposition into two parts, one due to changes in educational composition within residence categories (21.8 percent), and a second dueto changes in age-specific fertility within residence-education categories (52.9 per cent). In the second-order decomposition, then, about half the decline in theTFR stems from compositional changes in residence andeducation.

The increase in urban fertility is unexpected and demands at least a tentative explanation. Wemay hypothesize that the increase occurred in part because the urban educated classes were the principal beneficiaries of the extraordinarily rapid economic gains of thelate 1960's.

ity contributions in thefirst-orderand fourth-order decompositions are almost identical.
Let us now examine in more detail the impact on the TFR ofchanges in marital status composition. To simplify computations, we omit consideration of changes in parity composition, contributions from which are merged into aredefined and less finely specified fertility contribution. This merger has no effect on the magnitudes of the residence, education, and marital status contributions which form the focus of our attention.
In Table 5 each decomposition contains marital status as acompositional variable, in alternative combination with the residence and education variables. Note, however, that the order of introduction of variables is still the same asin Table 3. Decomposition (a) shows that with residence and education composition uncontrolled, the marital status contribution of 5.6 per cent tended todecrease the TFR,

in line with earlier studies. But when education isintroduced indecomposition (b), the marital status contribution reverses sign, changing from 5.6 to --10.3 per cent. If residence is substituted for educationas a control, in decomposition (c), the marital status contribution changes, from 5.6 to --2.9 per cent. Again there is a reversal of sign, butthe magnitude of the shift is smaller. These findings suggest that education has a somewhat larger impacton proportions married than does residence, in agreement with earlier studies (Kim et al., 1974). Decomposition (d)is taken from Table 3for comparison.
Table 6sheds further light on the relative importance ofthe residence andeducation variables. As mentioned earlier, Table 3 shows that with education introduced after residence, contributions tothe decline inthe TFR were 25.2 per cent for residence and 21.8per cent for education. Table 6 shows that when the variables are reversed and residence isintroduced after

education, the contributions are 42.6 per cent for education and only 4.6 per cent for residence. The value of 42.6 per cent also appears in Table S.
According to Table 6, changes in education composition would appear largely to explain away the effects of changes in residence composition on the country-wide TFR shown in Table 3. But the reasons why this is so are not immediately obvious. The lesser importance of changes in residence composition is principally due to the unusual circumstance discussed earlier, that the decline in rural fertility was partly offset by a rise in urban fertility. It is not true that within the same education category the TFR behaved similarly in urban and rural areas. In fact, such comparisons reveal striking differences. Table 7 shows the per cent contribution of changes in marital structure and marital fertility to change in the TFR within each residence-education group, derived by Equation (1) with marital status substituted for residence. Within the two education categories of primary school and more than primary school, urban and rural TFR's actually moved in opposite directions. And within all three education categories the relative importance of marital status and fertility contributions differed markedly between urban and rural areas.

Changes in age-specific proportions married tended to increase the TFR for each education group within the urban category and also for the more educated group within the rural category. In these four groups, age-specific proportions married rose, with very few exceptions, as shown by thekxrem values in Table 4. For those with no education or only a primary education in the rural category, however, changes in age-specific proportions married worked to reduce the TFR, though not by very much. Proportions married generally fell at the peak reproductive ages and rose at the late reproductive ages.
For those with primary or more education in the urban category, Table 7 shows that not only changes in marital structure but also changes in marital fertility worked to increase the TFR, reflecting increases in age-specific marital fertility at the peak reproductive ages shown in Table 1 and supporting our earlier hypothesis that younger couples in the urban educated classes were in an especially favorable position to add to their families during this period. For those with no education in the urban category and those with more than primary education in the rural category, however, changes in marital fertility tended to decrease the TFR, thereby offsetting increases in proportions

married. The large offsetting contributions of --157.9 per cent and 257.9 per cent from marital structure changes and marital fertility changes in the urban-none category occur because nearly offsetting unpercentaged contributions from changes in proportions married and changes in marital fertility are percentaged on a very small net decline in theTFR.
Table 7 suggests that the rise in urban fertility may have stemmed less from the higher fertility of newly arrived ruralurban migrants than from the especially favorable economic situation of young couples in the urban educated classes during this period. If the higher fertility of migrants were the dominant factor, one would not expect the increase in urban fertility to be more pronounced the higher the level of education, given that migrants were generally less educated than the urban average. More information about the fertility of migrants is needed, however, before a definitive statement can be made on this point.

dence and education were especially significant, the proportion of the female population aged 15-49residing in urban areas jumping from 38.6to 46.6per cent andthe proportion with no education dropping from 28.9to 19.4per cent.
Decomposition of the decline in the TFR over this period shows that about one-fourth of it can be attributed to changes in population composition byresidence, education, marital status, and parity, and about three-fourths to changes in age-specific birth rates cross-classified by these same characteristics. Changes in composition by residence and education largely explain the contribution of changes in marital composition to the decline in the TFR. With residence and education controlled, changes in marital composition actually tended to increase the TFR. Changes in education composition in turn largely explain the contribution of changes in residence composition to the decline in the TFR. Education emerges as thecompositional variable with the greatest explanatory power.

CONCLUSION

Between 1966 and 1970 the Korean total fertility rate fell by more than half a child, from an estimated 4,837 to 4,257 per thousand. Rapid change also occurred in population composition by urban-rural residence, education, marital status, and parity. Compositional changes by resi-
