ABSTRACT: Accepting the theoretical position that desired family size is likely to diminish as economic modernization occurs, the author analyzes the association between fertility and development using recent national data from less developed countries. Measures of income and equality are combined to provide an index of population "welfare." Multiple and cross-lagged correlations are used to demonstrate the magnitude and nature of the relationship between welfare and fertility rates. Despite inadequacies of the data, high negative correlations are obtained, and evidence is advanced to show that the direction of causation is from welfare to fertility.

Much demographic discussion has the period 1978-87. Readily available been focused on microanalytical models indices are used to increase the size of (e.g., Caldwell, 1983; Easterlin and the study group, despite the exclusion of Crimmins, 1985) which have examined the developed countries which now the mechanisms that relate develop- have uniformly low fertility rates.

Relatively few macroanalyses of the association between development and fertility have been published in the eighties. A paper by Omran and Salama (1986) draws attention to the variability of the phenomenon, but uses data from before 1975. This contribution updates the analysis with international data from
