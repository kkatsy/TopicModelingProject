ABSTRACT: Relatively little attention has been given to the interpretation of age-at-marriage differences in fertility. This paper discusses possible demographic and sociological sources of this differential. The argument is made that sociological interpretations deserve increased attention since most of the observed differential persists after control for likely demographic components (premarital pregnancy, unwanted fertility, and subfecundity) and for correlated social and background variables (education of self and parents, religion, farm background, number of siblings, whether respondent's parental family was intact, and husband's age at marriage). Multipleclassification analysis is employed. The analysis concludes by noting that age at first birth has an even stronger relationship with fertility than age at marriage and that the sociological dimensions of age relevant to age at marriage are even more appropriate to age at entrance into motherhood.

Although age at marriage is one of the strongest and most persistent factors affecting fertility, the nature of its effect has received little attention. The earliest Growth of American Families Study noted the importance of the age-at-marriage differential in fertility and suggested that fecundity was not likely to be a major part of its explanation (Freedman et al., 19S9). While a number of others have commented briefly on this relationship (e.g., Glass and Grebenik, 1954; Grabill et al., 1958; Westoffetal., 1963; Bumpass, 1969; Westoff, 1975), most often age at marriage has been treated primarily as a variable to be controlled in the analysis of other variables. Busfield (1972) is an exception, and a number of the issues discussed here are considered for England and Wales in his work.
In populations with little fertility control, age-at-marriage differentials in fertility are a rather straightforward consequence of differences in length of exposure to the risk of conception (Coale and Tye, 1961). However, in modern contracepting populations, this demographic component

is heavily conditioned by social factors such as effective contraceptive use and selective marriage patterns. In addition, several sociological hypotheses directly relating age and fertility decisions warrant examination. As other fertility differentials contract in modern societies, the ageat-marriage effect becomes increasingly important to the sociology of fertility (Westoff, 1975).
Two sorts of demographic factors may be involved in age-at-marriage differences in fertility in modern populations. The first is a modified version of the differential-exposure-time model in which "risk" becomes the conditional risk of unwanted birth given contraception. Obviously, the consequence of differing lengths of exposure decreases with improved contraceptive efficacy. Nevertheless, we would expect a continuing effect (Ryder and Westoff, 1972), except in the extreme case of universal sterilization at the birth of the last wanted child.
This effect has an exposure-time component and a risk component. The time component is obvious. Other things being

equal, the remaining years of risk after the birth of the last wanted child will be fewer for those marrying later. Average levelsof risk of unwanted fertility may differ because women who marry later have a higher proportion of the years at risk in the period of declining fecundity and more effective contraception (Ryder, 1973). However, there may be further differences in the average level of risk if there is any selection of the more fecund or less effective planners into younger ages at marriage.
Such selectivity is plausible in a society where a high proportion of those who marry young are pregnant at marriage (perhaps SOper cent of teenage marriages). Given the vastly inadequate nature of contraceptive use among unmarried teenage girls (Kantner and Zelnik, 1972), there could well be a tendency among those with sexual experience for the more fecund to get "caught" by pregnancy and for the less fecund to "survive" the risk of pregnancy to marry later. If this were the case, those who married young might be exposed to higher rates of risk of unwanted pregnancy, compared to women of the same age and contraceptive protection who married at later ages. The same selectivity might result in differences in contraceptive ability, as well as in fecundity, being associated with early marriage. In one longitudinal analysis, higher fertility was found for those who had been premaritally pregnant, net of social status factors, parity, methods of fertility control, and family-size expectations at the first interview (Wilson and Bumpass, 1973). We will explicitly evaluate the contribution of differentials in premarital pregnancy and in unwanted fertility to age-at-marriage differences in family size.
The second major demographic component may be an effect of age at marriage on wanted fertility as a consequence of increased subfecundity with age. In low

fertility populations, most women who marry "late" have sufficient remaining fecund years in which to bear an average number of children. Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly the case that higher proportions of late than of earlier marriers are unable to have all the children they want (Freedman étal., 19S9). The measurement of the role of subfecundity in completed family size is fraught with difficulty, but we will make some attempt to estimate the role of this factor in age-at-marriage differences in fertility.
Finally, we must be concerned with the degree to which the age-at-marriage differential in fertility reflects the correlation of age at marriage with other factors, of which wife's education is perhaps the most important.
To the extent that the age-at-marriage effect is attributable neither to fertility control variables nor to correlated socioeconomic variables, sociological explanations relating directly to age at marriage seem appropriate. One type of hypothesis relates to premarital and early marital socialization experiences; another is concerned with factors affecting the decision to terminate childbearing. The first type of explanation holds that entrance into marriage at later ages increases the opportunity for socialization into nonfamilial adult roles (Bumpass, 1969; Presser, 1971). When marriage and childbearing are begun early, each subsequent decision stage is reached at a less mature age than it is for women who begin the process later. This is an obvious but nontrivial point that bears elaboration. One dimension involves the extent to which secondary socialization for completing adult roles has occurred. For example, women who have their second child in their teens may contracept and consider the possibility of a third child in a markedly different field of perceived alternatives than do women who reach this stage in their mid-twenties.

dependent variable to take into account that small portion of intended fertility that has not yet occurred. Since there are remaining years of risk of unwanted fertility for this marriage cohort, the analysis may understate the level of unwanted fertility and perhaps the proportion of a completed fertility differential by age at marriage that is attributable to unwanted fertility. However, this truncation of experience should not affect the estimate of the intended component of the age-at-marriage differential. Women who gave birth prior to their first marriage have been excluded.
A marriage cohort, rather than a birth cohort, is employed in order to compare women who experienced similar marriage life-cycle stages during similar historical periods. Given the very radical swings in period fertility over the last two decades, comparisons of different ages at marriage within a birth cohort might confound period differences with age-at-marriage differences.
Table 1 reports the results of a dummy

variable regression analysis in the form of deviations from the grand mean. The various models relate to the issues outlined above. The gross effects represent the observed differences in fertility by age at marriage in this sample, ranging from 3.7 for the youngest group at marriage to 2.4 for the oldest in 1965, and from 3.5 to 2.S, respectively, for these age groups in 1970. This effect of age at marriage is not linear, but occurs primarily through the distinctly higher fertility of those who marry before age 18 and the lower fertility of those who marry after 25. (Somewhat less than onethird of the women in our samples married at these ages.)
The first model tests whether selectivity into early marriage through premarital pregnancy plays any role in the age-atmarriage effect on fertility. Controlling for premarital pregnancy does not at all reduce the effect of age at marriage. First births are coded as premarital pregnancies if they occurred before eight months after the date of marriage. While we know that

premarital pregnancy is substantially underrecorded in survey data, the lack of any reduction in Model 1casts strong doubt on either version of the selectivity hypothesis discussed above.
The second model includes a number of factors that are correlated with both age at marriage and fertility and that hence might be partially responsible for this relationship. Most important of these factors is the respondent's education, though also included are education of both her parents, number of siblings, whether her parental family was intact, farm background, whether she is Catholic, and her husband's age at marriage. Controlling for all of these vaiables actually increases the differential very slightly in both samples (negligibly in 1970). We conclude that the age-at-marriage effect is not at all a consequence of either selectivity by premarital pregnancy or of correlated background variables.
The next three models control sequentially and then jointly for subfecundity and the number of unwanted births. A

birth is coded as unwanted if a woman reported that she did not want to become pregnant again before the pregnancy in question. The measurement of subfecundity is extremely, problematic, but we are able to measure fairly well the component we are concerned with here. Women are coded as subfecund if they reported that they are unable to have a child because of involuntary sterility (whether or not an operation is the cause). In the absence of an operation, it is primarily those women who have tried to become pregnant and failed who discover their subfecundity, but these are the women most directly relevant to the issue we are considering. As expected, we find that both aspects of fertility control contribute to the observed age-at-marriage differential in fertility. When unwanted births and subfecundity are controlled, the difference between the two extreme age-at-marriage groups is reduced by about one-third in both years.
