ABSTRACT: A social selection model for deleterious genes has been studied by considering two alleles at one locus. The model allows for the fitness of an individual to be determined by parental phenotypes as well as by his/her own phenotype. We show that the equilibrium gene frequency depends on the loss of fitness of an individual due to the trait () and due to affected parents (P), and the probability that the heterozygote develops the trait (h). We show that whenever an interior equilibrium point exists for given values of  and , it is unique and that the sufficient condition for the existence of the equilibrium point is given by

Two individuals with identical genotypes or phenotypes may have different fitnesses because of abnormal sibs, parents, or other relatives. Such phenomena have been demonstrated for several diseases in man (Reed and Neel, 1959; Lindelius, 1970; Buck et al., 1975; Yokoyama, et al., 1980). These observations show that even if the individual has a normal genotype, mate-finding and fertility may be considerably affected by the existence of the affected individuals in the family. This type of fitness interaction among relatives has been called social selection, and theoretical studies have been conducted considering rare deleterious genes (Yokoyama, 1980a, b; Yokoyama and Templeton, 1980). In these studies, social selection is modeled by assuming that the relative fitness of a normal individual is reduced whenever he has at least one affected nuclear family member. The social selection may be regarded as the general family of kin selection models. However, the

term "social selection" may be more appropriate for human populations (see Discussion section). Yokoyama (1981) also considered the fitness modification of offspring due to affected parents, although he again only dealt with rare deleterious genes.
In this paper, we shall conduct deterministic analyses of the population dynamics of deleterious genes under the fitness modification of offspring by affected parents. We are especially interested in obtaining the equilibrium gene frequencies without the process of mutation. This study will complement the equilibrium analyses of Yokoyama (1981). The results obtained will be compared to those for the equivalent kin selection model anlayzed by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman (1978), and the implication of these differences for human populations will be discussed.

(see Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 1978). Clearly condition (16) is more restrictive than (17). Thus, it is harder to maintain a polymorphism under social selection than under kin selection. This is expected because viability selection operates before mating in the social selection model, whereas the viability and fertility selections are considered simultaneously in the kin selection model.

Fio. 1.--The region for a stable interior equilibrium point (dotted area).

In the analyses, the process of mutation has been ignored, and we have dealt only with common alleles. Under this condition we have shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the interior equilibrium point is - 2 y / ( l - 2y) < /? < - 2 y / ( l - y). When p > - 2 y / ( l y), with an additional process of mutational change from A2 to A, of a per generation, the equilibrium frequency of A, genes is given approximately
by a/hs for 0</z=£l, and Va/s for h = 0, where s = y + /?(1 --y) / 2 (Yokoyama, 1981). When 0 < -- 2y/(l -- 2y), there does not exist any interior equilibrium point, unless one assumes the consistent mutational change from A, to A2 in every generation. However, the occurrence of advantageous mutation in every generation seems to be very unlikely, and the equilibrium study in that range may not be meaningful. Thus, the present as well as the previous studies in Yokoyama (1981) cover the equilibrium analyses of the entire range of the combination of y and /?.
Fitness interaction among relatives has been considered in the study of altruism, where the concept of kin selection has an important role (Hamilton, 1964; Levitt, 1975; Matessi and

Jayakar, 1976; Charlesworth, 1978; Wade, 1978; Yokoyama and Felsenstein, 1978; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 1978; Uyenoyama and Feldman, 1980; and others).
Social selection may be regarded as the general family of kin selection models. However, the term "social selection" seems to be more appropriate for the following two reasons. First, the gene which causes a specific genetic disease is not directly involved in the change of his relatives' fitnesses, rather the fitness modification depends on the ambient social structure of a society. The magnitude of social impact may well differ from one society to another. Thus, the social structure is the main cause of the fitness modification. Second, considering the fitness modification of offspring by affected parents, we have shown that it is harder to maintain a polymorphism under social selection than under kin selection. This difference occurs because the loss of fitness of an altruistic parent cannot be determined until he/she has offspring so that viability selection in the usual sense can not be included in the kin selection model. Necessity of the coexistence of an altruist and a recipient for the fitness determination limits the applicability of existing theories in kin selection models to human populations. Obviously, genetic diseases in man can cause mortality of an individual before he/she has an offspring.
When a parent is affected and

he/she increases the fitness of the progeny, the stable equilibrium gene frequency can be attained as long as condition (10) holds. An interesting implication of the present model may be seen in the mechanism of the maintenance of the high incidences of albinisms among Amerindians in the Southwestern United States and Central America. Most of these populations are not large and therefore the joint effect of social selection and random genetic drift may be important (Yokoyama and Morgan, 1981). For this recessive disease Woolf and Dukepoo (1969) proposed a "cultural selection." Albino men stay at home because of their sensitivity to sunlight, while other men leave for work, and the former have a greater chance of passing their genes onto the next generation. However, in the studies of the Brandywine isolate and Zuni Indians, Witkop et al. (1972) did not find any evidence of such illegitimate offspring involving albinos. Albinos are completely accepted in the Hopi society, and traditional Hopis have only a positive attitude toward them (Woolf and Dukepoo, 1969). It is thus conceivable that even though albinos are less fit, their relatives have increased fitnesses.
