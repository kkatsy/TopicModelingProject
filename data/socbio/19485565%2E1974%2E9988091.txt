Considerable attention has recently been given to enabling couples to have the number of children they desire. The measure usually advanced to accomplish this humanitarian goal is a family planning program. Indeed, this goal has been the publicly stated rationale for the very existence of national family planning programs (Hartley, 1972, p. 317). However, it would be naive to suppose that leading advocates of these programs are unaware that the measures they propose have potential demographic as well as humanitarian value.
The chief demographic value of a national family planning program lies in the extent to which, through the prevention of unwanted births, it can contribute to a lower overall level of fertility. Along this line, a great deal of attention has been given lately to assessing the prevalence of unwanted childbearing and the extent to which its elimination would contribute to the stabilization of the population of the United States (Bumpass and Westoff, 1970; Ryder, 1972; and Commission on Population Growth and the American Future, 1972). Thus, Ryder and Westoff (1972, p. 471) state: "The extent of unwanted fertility is at the core of the debate

over the kind of fertility policy necessary to achieve replacement."
Although the elimination of unwanted childbearing would of necessity be an essential element of any program to enable couples to have the number of children they desire, and only that number, it must not be thought that the demographic value attached to the elimination of unwanted childbearing automatically accrues to programs designed to allow people to have the number of children they desire. Indeed, a moment's reflection leads to the inescapable conclusion that family planning programs are incapable of allowing all persons to have the number of children they desire.
The reason for this is that there are two types of couples who do not have the number of children they desire to have. One type has more children than desired. This has been called "excess fertility" (Harkavy et al., 1969, pp. 370-371; and Whelpton et al., 1966, p. 225), a phenomenon that has been given a fairly extensive treatment in the demographic literature. The other type of couples not having the number of children they desire are those with a family size smaller than desired, and this has been called "deficit fertility."

Although Davis (1967, p. 732) asserted seven years ago that people in industrial countries have fewer children than they would like to have, the occurrence of deficit fertility has been relatively ignored by the demographic profession. This is despite the fact that in national probability samples in the United States (Whelpton et al., 1966, p. 53; and Ryder and Westoff, 1971, p. 74) and Great Britain (Woolf, 1971, p. 31) the proportion of wives expecting to have fewer children than they desired was at least as large as the proportion expecting more than they desired. Weller and Chi (1973) have demonstrated that a considerable proportion of the deficit fertility observed in their study is voluntary.
Thus, programs to enable couples to have the number of children they desire are not identical with programs to eliminate unwanted childbearing, and the demographic effects attributed to the latter should not necessarily be attributed to the former. This is because if couples really did have the number of children they desire, and only that number, the elimination of unwanted births that currently occur could be counterbalanced by the occurrence of births that are wanted, yet under current conditions are not expected to occur, whether this be for voluntary or involuntary reasons.
The present study represents an attempted replication of the earlier study conducted by Weller and Chi (1973). It differs in two major respects. The earlier study utilized a probability sample of residents of only one state, Rhode Island, whereas the present paper utilizes data from the 1965 National Fertility Study. Although certainly useful for heuristic purposes, the results of the Rhode Island study cannot be generalized to the total United States population because of the high proportion of Catholics resident there and

because of the ethnic composition of the population. The second major difference concerns the manner in which desired family size, and hence excess fertility, is measured.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The source of data for this paper is the 1965 National Fertility Study. A detailed methodological description of the manner in which these data were collected and of the representativeness of the sample may be found in Ryder and Westoff (1971). For the purposes of this paper, analysis has been confined to 3,130 women who in 1965 were married (first marriage) with husband present, who were age 49 or younger, who gave numerical responses to items concerning cumulative, desired, and expected family size, and who have either been classified as fecund by the original analysts of the data or who have been sterilized for contraceptive purposes.
The two major dimensions of family size examined in this paper are desired and expected completed family size. For each woman, these dimensions are compared, and the outcome of this comparison is used to determine the fertility behavior classification. When desired family size is larger than expected family size, this has been termed deficit fertility; when desired family size is smaller than expected family size, this has been termed excess fertility; and when the two coincide, this has been termed congruent fertility.
Expected completed family size is measured by using responses to question 124 of the National Fertility Study and adding the additional number expected to the number of children already born. Essentially the same sort of information was gathered in the Rhode Island study.
Desired family size has been measured by using responses to the question: "If you could have exactly the number of children

you want, what number would that be?" Note that this question is somewhat different from the question used earlier by Weller and Chi (1973), who relied upon a quasi-retrospective and hypothetical measure of desired family size ("If you were just getting married, how many children would you like to have?"). The major difference between these two measures of desired family size is that the question used in the present study denotes a less retrospective orientation. It is also different from the indirect measure of wanted number of children used by Bumpass and Westoff (1970) and Ryder and Westoff (1971).
RESULTS
The women included in this analysis desire an average of 3.25 children, expect to have 3.54, and already have 2.79. When desired and expected completed family size are compared, 54.6 per cent desire the same number they expect to have, 27.2 per cent desire fewer children than they expect to have, and the remaining 18.2 per cent desire more than they expect to

have. These figures are somewhat different from those reported in the Rhode Island study, in which 19.3 per cent desired fewer than they expected and 23.7 per cent desired more than they expected to have (Weller and Chi, 1973).
Mean cumulative, desired, and expected family sizes have been computed for each of the fertility comparison categories and are presented in Table 1, along with the interrelationships between these variables. It can be seen that the strongest correlation is between children ever born and expected completed family size, and the weakest is that between desired family size and children ever born.
It can also be seen in Table 1 that the excess fertility women have the lowest desired family size, yet also have the highest expected and cumulative family sizes. On the other hand, the deficit fertility women have the highest desired family size, yet currently have and expect to have the least number of children. If all women had the number of children they desire, completed family size would be reduced from 3.54 to 3.25. By contrast, if all excess fertility

were eliminated and the deficit fertility women did not realize their fertility desires, completed family size would average 2.96. Although that would represent a considerable reduction over the total expected completed family size, it would be substantially above replacement level.
The remainder of this section will deal with the various characteristics of the women and/or spouses in an effort to determine whether or not the outcome of the fertility comparison is randomly distributed throughout the sample. Whenever possible, comparison will be made with the analyses conducted earlier by Weller and Chi (1973), Bumpass and Westoff (1970), and Ryder and Westoff (1971).
CHILDREN EVER BORN
It is clear in Table 1 that the fertility comparison categories are strongly related to the number of children ever born. The higher this number, the greater the probability that the respondent will be classified as expecting excess fertility and the less likely it is that she will be classified in the deficit fertility category. However, in the latter case, the decline over parity categories is not monotonic; rather, after three children, the parity seems to make little difference. These results are similar to those observed earlier by Bumpass and Westoff (1970) and Weller and Chi (1973).
CURRENT AGE AND DURATION OF MARRIAGE
In the Rhode Island analysis conducted by Weller and Chi, there was no systematic relationship between current age and the fertility comparison classification. When duration of marriage was considered, women married less than five years were less likely than other women to be in the excess fertility category, and the longer the duration of marriage, the more likely it was that the woman would be classified

as being in the deficit fertility category. A tabulation by Ryder and Westoff (1971, p. 58) shows that the size of the difference between expected and desired family size is not consistently related to either age of wife or number of years married among white women and that the size of this difference is much smaller among Negro women under age 20 or who had been married less than five years.
In the present study, up to age group 35-39, the probability of being classified in the excess fertility category increases and the likelihood of being in the congruent fertility decreases with age. Among those women over age 19, there is a positive association between age group and the probability of being classified as expecting deficit fertility. When duration of marriage is considered, women married less than five years are less likely than other women to be in the excess fertility category and, with two exceptions, the greater the duration of marriage, the more likely it is that the woman will be classified in the deficit fertility category.
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT
In their analysis, Weller and Chi (1973) observed that the greater the wife's educational attainment, the more likely it is that she will be in the deficit fertility category. They also observed that the greater the husband's educational attainment, the greater the probability of congruent fertility and the less likely the occurrence of deficit fertility. These differences largely remain when controls for differences in current parity are introduced. Bumpass and Westoff (1970, p. 1179) also indicate an inverse relationship between the wife's education and the incidence of unwanted births, although a major portion of this difference appears to be attributable to differences in cumulative fertility. Finally, Ryder and Westoff (1971, p. 54) introduce

Vol. 21, No. 1

Excess and Deficit Fertility

a tabulation showing that the size of the difference between expected and desired family size is systematically related to educational attainment, with "expectedminus-desired" changing from a positive figure at the lower levels of educational attainment to a negative figure at the higher levels of educational attainment. This is true among both racial categories, although the relationship seems stronger among blacks than among whites.
In the present study, there is an inverse relationship between educational attainment of the wife and excess fertility, and a positive association between education and the incidence of congruent and deficit fertility. When parity is controlled, the association between educational attainment and excess fertility becomes weaker as the parity group increases, and among the 5-or-more parity women it is present only among those with at least a high school education. Wife's educational attainment also is positively associated with the incidence of agreement between desired and expected family size among 0-2 parity women but this association is much weaker among 3-4 parity women and is absent among S-or-more parity women. This is consistent with the pattern observed earlier by Weller and Chi (1973). Finally, after parity is controlled, wife's educational attainment appears unrelated to the incidence of deficit fertility.
OCCUPATION OF HUSBAND
Although Weller and Chi (1973) report that there appears to be no apparent relationship between husband's occupation and the incidence of either excess or deficit fertility, Ryder and Westoff's (1971, p. 240) analyses indicate that white collar workers are less likely than other males to have excess fertility.
In the present analysis, when current parity is not controlled, in general the

higher the prestige of the male's occupation (cf. Nam, 1963), the less the incidence of excess fertility. White collar occupation is clearly differentiated from blue collar occupation in terms of relative ability to avoid excess fertility. When current parity is controlled, this is true only among those with 0-2 children ever born.
FAMILY INCOME
A final socioeconomic characteristic that may be related to the fertility comparison classification is family income. Weller and Chi (1973) report that those with an annual family income of $10,000 or more are somewhat less likely than others to have excess fertility and are much more likely than others to desire more children than they expect to have. Controlling for parity, those in the lowest income category were the most likely to have excess fertility and the least likely to have deficit fertility. Ryder and Westoff (1971, p. 241-242) report that husband's income is inversely related to the incidence of excess fertility among nonwhites but bears no relationship among whites.
Similar patterns exist in the present study. The higher the family income, the lower the incidence of excess fertility and the higher the incidence of deficit fertility and of agreement between desired and expected family size (although the latter association is very weak). Although the regularity of this pattern disappears when controls for current parity are introduced, it still is the case that women in families with a family income of $10,000 or more are less likely than other women to be in the excess fertility category and are more likely than others to be in the deficit fertility category.
WIFE'S LABOR FORCE STATUS
Another variable that may be related to the outcome of the comparison between

82

Weller

desired and expected family size is the wife's labor force status. Weller and Chi (1973) report that women in the labor force are more likely than women not in the labor force to be in the deficit fertility category and that this difference is most pronounced in the low (0-2) parity group. They also report that there appears to be no relationship between the specific occupation of the wife and the fertility classification.
In the present analysis, women not in the labor force are more likely than other women to be in the excess fertility category and are less likely to be in the deficit fertility category. As in the earlier analysis, there appears to be no systematic relationship between the comparison and the specific occupation of the woman.
RELIGIOUS PREFERENCE OF WIFE
Weller and Chi (1973) report that Catholics are more likely than Protestants to be in the excess fertility classification and that the difference is largely a function of differences in numbers of children already born. They also report that church attendance and the outcome of the comparison between desired and expected family size appear to be unrelated. One of Ryder and Westoff's tables (1971, p. 240) indicates that Catholics are less likely than Protestants to have excess fertility. However, another table (p. 74) indicates that, among wives with at least a high-school education, Catholics are more likely than Protestants to expect more children than they desire. Finally, Westoff and Westoff (1971, p. 229) report that women of both religious categories have experienced the same number of unwanted births.
The pertinent tabulations from the present analysis are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that differences between Catholics and Protestants are minimal, although both groups are more likely than "Others" to

be in the excess fertility category and are less likely to be in the congruent fertility category. With one exception, this pattern persists when controls for parity are introduced. It is also the case that within each current parity category, Protestants are more likely than Catholics to be in the excess fertility category. It can also be seen that frequency of church attendance is not systematically related to the fertility comparison classification. Controls for parity do not alter this observation. The frequency with which Catholics receive the sacraments also is unrelated to the outcome of the comparison between desired and expected family size.
RACE
A final characteristic examined is race. Ryder and Westoff's (1971, pp. 58, 240242) analyses indicate that among Negro women expected-minus-desired family size is 0.72 children while among white women it is --0.06 and that nonwhite couples are more likely than white couples to have excess fertility. Bumpass and Westoff (1970, p. 1178) demonstrate that this latter differential remains even when birth order is controlled.
Similar results are obtained in the present study (Table 3). Negroes are more likely than whites to be in the excess fertility category and are less likely to be classified as having deficit fertility. This pattern persists when controls for current parity are introduced.
Of course, there are also socioeconomic differences present between the two racial groups, and it is possible that these account for the differences observed above. To test this explanation, I have attempted to compare Negroes and whites while simultaneously controlling for wife's education, husband's occupation (white collar vs. blue collar), and husband's income. When this is done, it appears that the differentials

observed earlier are at least partiallyindependent of any differences in socioeconomic characteristics that may exist between whites and nonwhites (see Ryder and Westoff, 1972,p. 480 for an interesting explanation of racial differentials of unwanted childbearing).
CONTRACEPTIVE USE
Weller and Chi (1973) report that differences in methods of preventing conception that are currently in use are minimal between the three groups of respondents

but that excess-fertility women are characterized by a reliance in the past upon methods of preventing conception that require some degree of cooperation on the part of the male, e.g., rhythm, withdrawal, and condom. Deficit fertility women, according to Weller and Chi, were less likely to have ever used any method of preventing conception and had used a slightly smaller number of methods. This suggested that the excess fertility women had tried several methods before finding one that was effective and acceptable to them and

their spouse. Despite this, deficit fertility women were not less likely than other women to be using a method of preventing conception currently and, given that they were current users, were not less likely than other women to "always" use the method.
When the contraceptive behavior of the women in the current study is analyzed the differences between the three categories of women are minimal (Table 4).
CONCLUSIONS
One conclusion that can be drawn is that substantial proportions of American women do not expect to have the number of children that they say they desire to have. Moreover, it can be concluded that there are two such types of women--those with excess fertility and those with deficit fertility. The former seems likely because substantial proportions of women apparently are unable to prevent unwanted conceptions with the same contraceptive knowledge and technology which, for some reason, other women have been able to use more effectively. The existence of this group is not surprising, and efforts should be made to discover exactly why they have more children than they desire and to take appropri-

ate steps to remedy the situation, whether these steps include developing a different system of delivering contraceptive knowledge and/or technology or whether they include permitting a socially untraumatic termination of any such unwanted pregnancies.
However, it also must be concluded that there is a substantial proportion of women who expect to have fewer children than they state they desire to have. The high proportion of such women in the earlier study by Weller and Chi (1973) might have been attributable to the high proportion of Catholics in the sample. Since Catholics have relatively high family size desires, it is only reasonable that substantial proportions of a predominantly Catholic sample should report that their desired family size is higher than the number of children they expect to have. However, this line of reasoning certainly is not applicable to the present analysis, for Catholics represent a small proportion of the total sample, and deficit fertility does not occur only among the Catholics.
The reader may grant the existence of such women, yet, very reasonably, ask "So what?" The answer to this query is that the existence of such women, in the

proportions reported in this study and in previous national probability samples, demonstrates that programs to enable people to have the number of children they desire, and only that number, are not demographically identical to programs to eliminate unwanted childbearing. Accordingly, demographic benefits that would

accrue to the latter would not necessarily accrue to the former. Indeed, if the results obtained in the present studies are meaningful, then it is clear that programs to attain population stabilization that are based solely on the premise that each couple should have the number of children they desire (and only that number) will not be completely successful, unless family size desires are reduced considerably beneath the levels reported in this study. This conclusion seemingly is at odds with that drawn by Ryder and Westoff (1971, p. 93) who state that their analysis of the National Fertility Study data "supports actions designed to enable people to have the number they want rather than attempt to change the number they want." Essentially the same conclusion was drawn earlier by Bumpass and Westoff (1970).
The reason for this disparity is primarily methodological. I used a direct approach to measure desired family size, i.e., a question eliciting desired family size directly from the respondent. Ryder and Westoff (1971) and, to a certain extent, Bumpass and Westoff (1970) have chosen to measure wanted family size. This measure was obtained indirectly. Apparently the respondents were separated into two groups. Among those who intended to have more children, wanted family size was measured as the total number of children the woman intended to have. Among those who intended to have no more children, the measure of wanted family size was taken to be their current parity minus the number reported as having been unwanted at the time of conception, depending upon the answers to a series of questions asked about the circumstances of each pregnancy in a woman's history (Ryder and Westoff 1971, p. 93). Ryder and Westoff (1972) follow a similar procedure and hence reach similar conclusions.

Given this difference in approaches, the method of measuring desired family size utilized in this study yields figures considerably higher than those obtained by the earlier analysts of the National Fertility Study. As Bumpass and Westoff (1970, p. 1181) state, married women aged 35-44 in 1965 reported through the direct (question) approach a desired family size of 3.4 children, as compared with 2.5 children estimated by their procedure. Ryder and Westoff (1971, p. 93) report that the estimate of the number of children wanted for all women in their sample is 2.7 children compared with 3.3 children estimated by the conventional measure of the desired number of children.
Thus, in evaluating the meaningfulness of this study, as well as of the earlier analyses of these same data, one must be concerned with the measure of desired family size. Is the direct method utilized in this study less valid (behaviorally if not methodologically) than the indirect measure of wanted family size utilized by the earlier analysts? That the two methods produce different levels of family size targets--both in the aggregate and for individual women--is obvious. Consequently, there is not a complete overlap of women classified as being in the excess fertility category. That is, some of the women classified by the indirect method as having excess fertility are not so classified by the direct method used in this study, and not all women classified as having or expecting to have excess fertility by the method used in this study would be so classified by Bumpass and Westoff.
The primary criticism that Bumpass and Westoff (1970, p. 1181) have of the direct approach to measuring desired family size is that there is considerable rationalization (and idealization) of past fertility behavior (also see Ryder and Westoff 1971,

p. 27). That this occurs is undeniable. However, for the 3,130 women included in the present analysis, the correlation between desired family size (direct question) and the number of children ever born is not unity (0.45). Thus, any tautology that might exist is far from complete. Moreover, this correlation is lower than that between desired family size and expected completed family size (0.57), thus indicating that the couples' family size desires represent a goal, albeit with idealized overtones, rather than mere rationalization. Surely this would not be unimportant when considering programs to enable couples to have the number of children they desire, and only that number. Perhaps it was in this vein of thought that Ryder and Westoff (1971, p. 53-74) devoted the first half of their chapter "Racial, Religious, and Socioeconomic Differences in Fertility" to comparing expected and desired family size (measured directly) across various categories of people.
Bumpass and Westoff contend that when the indirect method of measuring wanted family size is utilized, the time focus is upon evaluation of the event at the time of pregnancy. They assert (p. 1181):
Although the responses may still be influenced by intervening experience, this bias should be much less than the bias when the reference is to the present, or to the future conditioned to the present.
If this reasoning is correct, then their measure should produce less understatement of the extent of excess fertility than the direct approach to measuring desired family size used in the present study. Actually, both approaches indicate about the same incidence of excess fertility. Thus, of the 3,130 women contained in this analysis, 26 per cent are classified as having execss fertility using the indirect approach of Bumpass and Westoff, and 27 per cent are so classified using the

direct approach to measuring desiredfamily size. However, as noted earlier, there is disagreement concerning which particular women have experienced excess fertility. Moreover, with few exceptions, the same differentials associated with having excess fertility are observed by the direct and indirect approaches of measuring excess fertility.
Perhaps the major criticism of the Bumpass and Westoff procedure is that it renders impossible theoccurrence of deficit fertility; that is, it assumes that there are no couples (orwomen) who desire to have more children than they expect to have. This assumption seems questionable to this writer, for not only are there couples that arephysiologically incapable of bearing as many children as they would like to bear, but there must also be some couples who have voluntarily restricted their family size to a number smaller than they would desire because of the restraints of their particular socioeconomic situation, idiosyncratic reasons, etc. The issue is how many such couples exist, what are their characteristics in relation to those of other couples, andwhy don't they have

the number of additional children they desire to have.
Thus, the earlier analysts of the National Fertility Study have largely drawn our attention to only one type of deviation from desired (or wanted) family size. If one is only interested in "assessing the demographic implications of perfect contraception" (Bumpass and Westoff 1970, p. 1181), then this is not a dysfunctional restriction. Indeed, perfect contraception could only lower fertility among those having unwanted fertility and the extent to which there mayalso be couples who desire fertility higher than they currently expect to have is immaterial because no contraceptive program would even attempt to enable these couples to realize their desires. However, such an approach is inadequate for dealing with the extent to which women have the number of children they desire to have.
