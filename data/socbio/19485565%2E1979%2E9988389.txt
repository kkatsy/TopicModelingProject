ABSTRACT:Procedures are presented for estimating from null segments the natural fecundability of couples who may be practicing contraception. The procedures include an assessment of bias. Also presented is a new measure designed to bring out the implications for residual fertility of the pregnancy outcome probabilities and fecundability functions recorded for givenfive-yearage classes of respondents. Application is made to two Taiwan samples featuring segment coded data.

closely a birth, intervals directly preceding initial acceptance of contraception afford an inflated measure of fertility and may vary depending on the length of interval chosen. Moreover, for age classes younger than thirty years and given that acceptance of contraception presupposes attaining a certain parity, then, as pointed out by Barrett and Brass (1974), there tends to be a capitalization on chance factors toward higher-than-average fertility and therefore a subsequent regression toward the mean by postacceptance potential fertility.
In another analysis, Wolfers (1969) employed as a measure of gross potential fertility in the absence of both contraception and induced abortion the reciprocals of "prospective" closed birth intervals of nonusers classified by wife's age at start of the interval. Later Wolfers (1976) abandoned this approach when he found that such prospective birth intervals tend to shorten with advancing age, rather than lengthen, as a consequence of truncation biases.
Another more elaborate technique to be evaluated in this paper proceeds in two main steps. The first step is to derive "fecundability functions" for five-year classes by means of a life table analysis applied to "null" segment data. A null segment is a succession of fecundable months during which the respondent avows no anticonception practices. By a fecundability function is meant the proportions conceiving within 1, 2, . . . fecundable months after postpregnancy anovulation in the absence of contraception. In addition, the combined risk of pregnancy wastage is obtained for each five-year age class from data on the proportions of pregnancies terminating in live births, induced abortions, and "other" (i.e., early or late spontaneous pregnancy losses).
A second step is to consider the residual births that might accrue from age x to end of the reproductive period if the fol-

lowing conditions prevail: (1) the fecundability function and risk of pregnancy wastage characteristic of age class x to x + 4 remain fixed to end of the reproductive period; (2) no contraception is practiced; (3) probability distributions of gestation and postpregnancy anovulation conditional on outcome of pregnancy remain at their average values; and (4) risk of secondary sterility operates in a normal agedependent fashion. To implement this inquiry, each pairing of fecundability function and risk of pregnancy wastage characteristic of a particular five-year age group must be inserted into a large model whose structure will be detailed later. To emphasize its hypothetical nature, the resultant measure of residual cumulative fertility will be called a "residual fertility projection."
The present approach may be considered more versatile than previous ones for being able to encompass differing levels of dependence upon induced abortion. However, this approach cannot be justifiedunless one can control reasonably well the biases attending null segments. The Taiwan data available for the present analysis are rich enough to permit comparing fecundability functions and residual fertility projections within a classification of age, parity, and family planning status (spacing desired births versus preventing further childbearing).
In the next section, major suspected biases associated with null segments are identified and a plan for assessing them outlined. Later sections treat data, pregnancy outcome probabilities, fecundability functions, and finally their structuring into residual fertility projections.

Exposure to childbearing is ideally coded into segments of gestation and postpregnancy anovulation, classified by outcome of pregnancy, and segments of fecundable exposure partitioned into null segments and segments of contraceptive use. If contraception is not being practiced, a null segment begins when postpregnancy anovulation ends. If contraception is being practiced during fecundable exposure, a null segment begins when that contraception is discontinued. A null segment may itself be terminated either by the start of a segment of contraception use or by any of the events terminating the respondent's fertility history such as divorce, separation, sterilization, menopause, loss to follow-up, or study cut-off.
As a concrete illustration, suppose that after a birth there ensues a contraceptive segment lasting C, months (C, longer than the period of postpartum anovulation), followed succesively by a m-month null segment, a second contraceptive segment of C2 months, and finally a second n-month null segment ending in pregnancy. The two null segments are each assigned to that five-year age class to which the wife belonged at its inception. As contributions to the life table analyses of fecundability, the first null segment is coded as spanning ordinal months 1 torn, the second as spanning ordinal months 1to n (not ordinal months m + 1 to m + n). This coding convention, which greatly simplifiedthe data processing, may be suspected of introducing a bias toward slow conception inasmuch as the second null segment women are necessarily women who have "survived" the first segment and are therefore selected for lower fecundability on that account. Fortunately, the severity of this bias, which is tested below, appears to be slight.
Null segments afford the raw material from which, by means of a life table analysis (Mode et al., 1977), fecundability func-

tions are estimated; but in this role null segments are subject to three further putative biases, all tending to reduce apparent fecundability. First, never-users of contraception who demonstrate to themselves their subfecundity by slowness to conceive may feel less demographic pressure and therefore be less likely to adopt contraception for the first time at a given parity than more rapid conceivers, while everusers of contraception who suspect that they might have become sterile or subfecund are likely to shift into a nonuser status. Without special controls, both groups may figure disproportionately in null segments. Second, errors in the reported timing of contraception can result in segments of ostensible nonuse that in fact are affected by contraception. This bias has been proposed as a leading cause of the sizable differences typically found between conceptive delays occuring in the reported absence of contraception and those reported as following deliberate interruptions of contraception (Potter et al., 1963). A third possible bias arises from the deliberate concealment of induced abortion, evidence for which in Taiwan is cited by Chi et al. (1972) and by Tietze and Dawson (1973). Here one does not know how relatively often the time involved in the unwanted pregnancy and its conceiving is reported as a span of successful contraception or as a period of failure to conceive despite not practicing contraception.
Presumably these data problems would not be serious for a sample of youthful spacers practicing little contraception or abortion. Respecting family limiters, one would hope that a prospective study design would attenuate at least that source of bias resulting from miscoded times of contraceptive use.
By restricting the set of null segments to those that either themselves are ended by conception or else are followed even-

Owing to their extensive practice of contraception, the 4,782 Taichung limiters report only slightly more than 3,000 pregnancies after their intial IUD, less than one per woman. A majority of pregnancies were ostensibly conceived during contraceptive rather than null segments. The bottom panel of Table 1gives information about pregnancy outcomes. As compared to KAP IV spacers, Taichung limiters exhibit a relatively high induced abortion rate as well as more complete reporting of their spontaneous pregnancy losses. Indeed, the incidence of live births is below half for all three age classes and actually is exceeded by the reported incidence of induced abortion in the two older age classes. Such high rates of induced abortion occurring mostly in the first trimester of pregnancy must mean that an appreciable fraction of potential spontaneous pregnancy terminations are anticipated by abortion procedures (Potter et al., 1975).

Accordingly, the reported rates of spontaneous pregnancy losses, varying from 0.09 to 0.11, are high enough to suggest relatively complete reporting, though the possibility cannot be excluded that some induced abortions are being disguised as spontaneous ones. Induced abortion was illegal throughout the period of the Taichung Study, though the relevant statute was never strictly enforced.
Information about null segments from the Taichung Study is furnished in Table 2. Given are the number, mean, and variance of null segments classified by age of wife and outcome of the segment (pregnancy or shift to a specified contraceptive). The main object of the table is to compare three sets of null segments. Widest is the "open set" of null segments comprising all null segments excepting only those that directly follow a birth or are ended for some reason other than pregnancy or resumption of contraception,

such as separation, divorce, loss-tofollow-up, study cut-off, and the like. Intermediate and constituting a subset of the "open set" is the "closed set" of null segments which includes all the null segments ending in pregnancy or else followed by a contraceptive or null segment that does. This restriction reduces numbers of segments from 25 to over 40 per cent, the reduction becoming larger with older age. The narrowest set comprises a subset of the closed set restricted to first null segments following the initial IUD that qualified the wife for inclusion into the study. This second restriction further reduces numbers by about a quarter. Thus,

in the closed set of null segments, three quarters are "initial" segments, three quarter are "subsequent." Note that "initial" and "subsequent" is being defined here for six- to nine-year reproductive histories, not for birth intervals.
The relative brevity of null segments ending in a return to IUD use reflects the high IUD reinsertion rates, especially after an involuntary expulsion, with many of these reinsertions occuring after only a few days. Though not shown in Table 2, the median lengths of null segments ending in an IUD insertion are 1.0 or 2.0 months in all three age classes.

segments ending in pregnnacy, the distinction between "open" and "closed" sets disappears. Moreover, onenotes that the addition of subsequent segments to initial ones scarcely changes the means and variances. One would not expect this near lack of change if either the suspected biases from overlap with postpartum anovulation orfrom the manner of-coding ordinal months of null segments were having serious consequences. On the other hand, it must beadmitted that the other suspected biases--concealment ofinduced abortion, misallocation of contraceptive segments, or self-selection ofwives suspecting subfecundity--could be operating equally on initial and subsequent null segments.

FECUNDABILITY FUNCTIONS
By a life table method (Mode and Soyka, 1977), null segments have been transformed into fecundability functions furnishing estimated cumulative proportions conceiving within specified numbers of fecundable months in the reported absence of contraception. With the exception of those immediately following a birth, allnull segments are utilized togive the lower bound estimates of cumulative proportions conceiving that are assembled in Table 3. Although more detailed output is available, it suffices to represent coefficients for a few chosen durations. The six-year cumulative proportions re-

quired extrapolation of one year in the case of KAP IV data since in this study segment coding was extended back only five years. These extrapolations change results only in the third decimal place if at all. No such extrapolation was required respecting Taichung coefficients, six years being the minimum duration between first interview and study cut-off date. The corresponding fecundability functions based on "closed" null segments are presented in Table 4.
In Table 3, the lower bound estimates of fecundability among KAP IV spacers exhibit very little decline between ages 20-24 and 25-29 years and only slightly more decline between ages 25-29 and 30-34 years. It is to be kept in mind that the last age class is represented by perilously small numbers. With regard to parity, among women ages 20-24 years, the proportions conceiving within six months decreases from a high of 0.681 for zero parity women to 0.498 for second parity women, yet the proportions conceiving within six years show the opposite trend.
These opposing trends may reflect the joint operation of two quite distinct mechanisms, one affecting the level of fecundability among nonsterile couples and the other affecting the proportions sterile. The difference in six-month conception rates may arise because women of lower parity by virtue of shorter marriage durations average higher coital rates and therefore higher fecundability if not sterile than do higher parity women, even while belonging to the same five-year age class. On the other hand, with a mean age of marriage near 20, having a second child while still not yet 25 years of age selects for a recent birth and therefore less sterility, thereby perhaps accounting for such a high proportion conceiving within six years among second parity spacers aged 20-24.
The fact that among the several spacer

subsamples, the proportions conceiving within six years vary around a value of 0.93, and thus well short of 1.0, suggests the presence of some subfecundity and natural sterility. Indeed, for the zero parity wives, a proportion of 0.93 implies a primary sterility rate of 0.07 which is high relative to general experience, thereby suggesting a bias from the inclusion of contraceptive use time in some null segments owing to segment misallocation.
Turning to the Taichung limiters, we were surprised to find a fecundability function for women aged 25-29 years so similar to those of first and second parity KAP IV spacers of the same age class. We had expected that the apparent fecundability of Hmiters would show the effect of stronger downward biases. Practice of contraception did not become common among Taiwan spacers until after 1970 (Sun et al., 1978) and most of the spacing experience of KAP IV women took place well before 1970. In contrast, to become eligible for inclusion in the Taichung Study, a couple had to accept an IUD. Moreover the subsequent experience of this sample has involved extensive use of contraception and induced abortion. Thus, there would appear to be much more opportunity for unreported induced abortion and misallocated contraceptive segments among Taichung Hmiters than among KAP IV spacers; and indeed these sources of negative bias may have contributed to the rather steep decline of apparent fecundability with increasing age seen for the Taichung Hmiters in Table 3.
Nevertheless, compensating for these stronger negative biases in the Taichung sample may be a selection toward higher than average fecundability. This selection would be especially strong in the 25-29 age class because of the fact that acceptance of the original IUD so often followed closely a childbirth, an event selecting against being already sterile or even se-

riously subfecund. Concurrently, the underreporting of spontaneous fetal losses among KAP IV spacers, demonstrated in Table 1, would be depressing their apparent fecundability. Thus, the similarity between spacers' and limiters' fecundability for age class 25-29 years may represent a balancing of biases rather than their absence.
By the very nature of the subsets of null segments underlying Table 4, the proportions conceiving within six years have to be essentially 1.0. Hence the largest contrasts between Tables 3 and 4 occur for those subsamples which in Table 3 have the lowest fecundability functions. Table 4 differentials within the spacer and limiter samples are identical in pattern to those of Table 3 but weaker. Close similarity continues to exist for women aged 25-29 years between the apparent fecundabilities of KAP IV first-and second-parity spacers and Taichung limiters.
How serious are the divergences between Tables 3 and 4 for estimating potential fertility? An answer is best obtained by substituting the alternative pair of fecundability functions into an appropriate index of potential fertility that keeps other relevant factors constant, as is shown below.
RESIDUAL FERTILITY PROJECTIONS
Needed is an exploratory index of potential residual fertility that will reflect as directly as possible the pregnancy outcome proportions of Table 1 (interpreted as probabilities) and the fecundability functions of Table 3 or Table 4. Any family-building model requires additional elements before it can generate estimates of residual fertility. These elements include: (1) a base age x from which to reckon residual fertility; (2) specification of the reproductive state or states occupied at that base age; (3) lengths of gestation and anovulation conditional upon outcome of

pregnancy; and (4) ages at onset of secondary sterility.
Gestational lengths conditional on outcome of pregnancy are coded in both the KAP IV and Taichung studies. Postabortion and poststillbirth anovulation are not coded, but they are so trivially short that assumptions about them have little capacity for distortion. The coding of menopausal status fails egregiously to capture the full scope of primary and secondary sterility. Used in its place will be the fecundity decrement table of Pittenger (1973). The cost in objectivity of this borrowing is reduced by the fact that the course of natural sterility, barring situations where venereal disease is rife, appears to be fairly constant from one population to another. At least the few empirical age curves, which Pittenger fits by an exponential function, do not indicate otherwise.
Another unavoidable borrowing is a function for postpartum anovulation. The theoretical curve most often used is a Pascal distribution originally proposed by Barrett (1969), comprising a sum of two geometric random variâtes whose common parameter governs the mean length of the distribution generated. On the basis of auxiliary information (Jain et al., 1977) this mean has been set at 11 (in months) and for convenience is assumed constant for all ages.
There remains the problem that for KAP IV spacers there are adequate data to estimate the pregnancy outcome probabilities or fecundability functions of age classes exceeding thirty years and a corresponding difficulty for Taichung limiters older than forty years. An index of residual potential fertility has been chosen which avoids the need for extrapolation, namely, the mean number of residual births to be expected from age x to end of the reproductive period (as limited by secondary sterility) if the pregnancy outcome

residual fertility projections are simply the per capita live births cumulated in this fashion.
Any borrowing of data or of theoretical curves impairs the strict objectivity of the procedure. However, the objectivity sacrificed is not great provided that the borrowed reproductive factor is minor in its impact (e.g., postabortion or poststillbirth anovulation), or is relatively constant from one population to another (age at onset of physiological sterility), or is reducible to a single parameter curve whose specification is guided by data specific to the population of interest (e.g., postpartum anovulation). What is important, then, is that the two most problematic factors in the sense of having large impacts and being highly variable from one population to another--namely, natural fecundability and probabilities of pregnancy outcomes--are being estimated from data.
In Table 5 are collected for comparision nine pairs of residual fertility projections. While sharing the same set of pregnancy outcome probabilities (and the same sterility and postpartum anovulatory functions), the lower projection of any pair reflects a fecundability function from Table 3 while the higher projection draws its fecundability function from Table 4.
The differences between lower and upper bounds prove quite large. Expressed as a percentage of the lower bound, the difference between the two tends to increase with a greater base age.
The reduction in residual fertility projections with increasing base age reflects the reduced marriage duration over which residual births are being accumulated. Among limiters, diminishing live birth probabilities and decreasing fecundability also contribute to the decline of residual fertility. Largely accounting for the lower residual fertility projections of limiters than spacers are the former's much higher probabilities of fetal loss.

The residual fertility projections of Table 5 carry interesting implications. Respecting spacers, the absence of contraception assures that relatively few fecundable months are required for conception, especially if the fecundability functions of Table 4 are employed. These short conceptive delays guarantee numerous pregnancies, most of which end in live births, to yield high residual fertility projections. If the proportions of pregnancies ending in live births are overestimated owing to an underreporting of fetal losses, there is compensatory inflation of the conceptive delays from the same cause. The number of residual births projected depends closely on the base age because depending whether it is 20,25, or 30 years, the corresponding residual reproductive periods average in the vicinities of 25, 20, and 15 years.
A very different picture emerges for limiters. The absence of contraception occasions the same relatively quick course of conception, again especially when predicated upon the fecundability functions of Table 4. A large number of pregnancies per capita can be expected on these grounds alone; but increasing their numbers further are the deliberate interruptions of half of all pregnancies by induced abortion, with each interruption abbreviating gestation length as well as eliminating a segment of postpartum anovulaîion, thereby producing more fecundable months in which to conceive. Indeed, total projected pregnancies among the three age classes of Taichung limiters are roughly double the projected numbers of residual births. Stated otherwise, when the base age is as young as 25, then an appreciable number of residual births can be projected despite half of all pregnancies being deliberately interrupted because of the very fact that the combination of so many abortions together with no contraception produces such a high number of pregnancies.

DISCUSSION
From the comparison of Tables 3 and 4, it is plain that the feeundability functions derived from the unrestricted set of null segments are quite different from those constructed from the restricted subsets of "closed" null segments. As a consequence, among subsamples of KAP IV spacers, differences between lower and upper bound projections of residual fertility, using unrestricted and restricted sets of null segments respectively, are roughly two births. Although of smaller absolute values, these differences among Taichung limiters when expressed as percentages of the lower bound are large, exceeding 100 per cent for the 35-39 age class. What is plainly implied, then, is that any estimates of gross potential fertility derived through use of null segments will be sensitive to one's choice of procedure and in particular to the decision of whether to use a restricted or unrestricted set of null segments.
A related question is whether the downward biases (selection for subfecundity, incorrect reporting of contraception practice times and nonreporting of induced abortion) that are probably depressing the lower bound projections of Table 5 are stronger or weaker than the truncation biases that are presumably inflating the corresponding upper bound projections. An independent check relevant to the spacer subsample is available from a 1953 fertility survey undertaken in Yunlin, a rural district of Taiwan (Tuan, 1958). That the date of interview was early enough so that couples aged 45 years or older were practicing little birth control is strongly supported by a mean age at last confinement of around 40 years. Women aged 50 to 64 years whose first marriage was still intact at age 50 averaged 7.6 births. Mean age of marriage for the 45-64 year old group is reported as 19 years. Hence, adjustment for a base age of 20

years directly followed by a period of postpartum anovulation implies a residual fertility of around 7.0 births, barely higher than the lower bound projections given in Table 5 for KAP IV spacers age 20-24 years.
However, to claim no downward bias, the lower bound projection for spacers 20-24 years of age would have to exceed the relevant total fertility rate of the Yunlin sample because of exempting feeundability and risk of pregnancy loss from aging effects. This not being the case, it seems necessary to concede that the lower bound estimates of Table 5 for spacers carry some downward bias, unless one is prepared to argue either that the Pittenger sterility curve is overestimating sterility or that lactation amenorrhea was shorter in the earlier period. In any case, the authors lean toward the proposition that, at least for spacers, the unrestricted null segments offer a better glimpse into feeundability functions than the restricted ones.
A firm conclusion is not-possible concerning which bounds, those of Table 3 or 4, are closer to the true feeundability functions of the Taichung limiters. No independent check comparable to the Yunlin fertililty survey is available. For example, in an interesting analysis of Taichung data based on a highly simplified familybuilding model of Sheps, Sullivan et al, (1976) concluded that induced abortion is lowering fertility by 12 per cent, but their estimate is predicated on observed levels of contraception and applies only to a single calendar year, 1968, in the history of the study sample.
It has already been suggested that the similarity of the feeundability functions estimated for Taichung limiters aged 25-29 to those of the first and second parity KAP IV counterparts may have rested on a balancing of positive and negative biases. For reasons given in the text, it is hypothesized that those two sets of biases

are stronger forthe limiters than the spacers.

APPENDIX

The purpose of this Appendix is to give a brief outline of the algorithms used in calculating the residual fertility projections presented in Table 5. All the algorithms used in these calculations have been published elsewhere (see Mode and Soyka, 1977). In what follows, all equation numbers will refer to those inthe paper just cited.
Given the computer input as described in the main body of this paper, the calculations yielding the numbers in Table 5 proceeded in steps. The first step was to calculate a matrix function A(x,t) of the form displayed in Equation (2.1)for each rowin Table 5. Theprocedure used incarrying outthese calculationshas been described inSections 8and9of Modeand Soyka (1977). Foreach matrix function A(x,t) so calculated, x = 20, 25, 30, and 35, corresponding to theage classes inTable 5. For each fixed x in A(x,t), the i-variable ran on a monthly scale till that time corresponding to age 50. If, for example, x = 20, then the tvariable ran over a 30-year span, or, equivalently, from 1to360.
The next step in the calculations was to calculate an age-dependent distribution function, H(x,t), defined as follows. Given that a birth is experienced at t = 0 when a woman is age x, H(x,i) is the conditional probability the next birth occurs sometime during the timeinterval (0,í), t > 0. This distribution function was basic to the discussion, because the measure of residual fertility used in this paper was based on the notion of an age-dependent renewal process governed by the conditional distribution function H(x,t).
In such a renewal process, H{x,i) is inter-

preted as the conditional distribution function of the waiting times among live births. Let v(x,t) be the mean number of live births experienced during the closed time interval (0,f), given that a birth was experienced t = 0when a woman was age x. Observe that the birth occurring at t = 0isincluded in v(x, t). Theresidual fertility function used in this paper was defined by

,i) = v{x,t)- 1,

(A.I)

i.e., the birth at t = 0 was not counted. The values of R(x,t) reported in Table 5 were R(x,50-x) forx = 20,25,30, and 35.
A theoretical expression for v(x,t) in terms of H(x,t) was given in Equation (3.11), where, in this case, the age-dependent convolutions on the right are to be interpreted as convolutions of H(x,t) with itself. The mean function v(x,t) was computed in terms of its density function m(x,t), where

v(x,t) = ¡'om(x,s)ds.

(A.2)

The density m(x,t), in turn, wasactuallycomputed on a discrete lattice of < x,t > - points, using Littman's algorithm.
This algorithm is merely the recursion formula,

defined for í > 1, where m(x,0) = 1 for all x. In (A.3) the function h(x,t) is the density h(x,t) = H(x, t)- H(x, i-1), t > 1, with H(x, 0) = 0 for all x. An up-to-date matrix version of Littman's algorithm has been presented in the appendix of Mode and Pickens (1979). The

principles outlined there can easily be extended to derive formula (A.3). It should also be mentioned that a matrix verion of Littman's algorithm was used to solve the system of equations in (3.9), during the course of the calculations leading to H(x,t).
