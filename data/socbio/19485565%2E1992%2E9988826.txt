ABSTRACT: Data on 8,308 menstrual cycles from 1,740 South Indian women prospectively recorded were analyzed to identify the effect of age on menstrual cycle length. The distribution was skewed to the right with the mean (SD) cycle length of 31.8 (6.7) days. The range of 25-40 days constituted 10-82 per cent of menstrual cycle lengths. In no age group did 28-day cycles occur in more than 9 per cent of women. Variability as measured by the standard deviation was high among those below 19 years of age, stabilized during 25-39 years, and then increased in women aged 40 years or more. The findings are discussed in the light of other studies and possible implications in fertility control programs.

Despite a number of statistical studies, there still remains considerable lack of agreement on the average length of human menstrual cycles, the extent of variability, and its correlates. The notion of a 28-day cycle arose mainly from hospital case records and interviews with patients (Chiazze et al., 1968). Menstrual cycles described retrospectively with no written documentation pose problems of validation (Collett et al., 1954; Chiazze et al., 1968; Matsumoto, 1963; Vollman, 1966; Treloar, 1972). Collett et al. (1954) have used Basal Body Temperature (BBT) as the means of identifying the day of ovulation and reported that median cycle length was close to 28 days at all ages. The mode fell from 30 days in the youngest group to 25 days in the oldest. Vollman (1966) studied 12,571 menstrual cycles covering the entire reproductive period of 546 women and found that following menarche, 45 per cent of the BBT records are monophasic with short pre-

menstrual phases of 3 to 10 days duration. This study had presented the statistics of premenstrual phases as follicular and luteal phases.
The success of the rhythm or natural family planning method depends on accurate knowledge of variations in the menstrual cycle of the user, allowing for the unsafe period to be avoided. The need for precise information on menstrual phenomena has increased as a result of the introduction of steroid hormones and the IUD for contraception. Some of the side effects of both of these methods of contraception relate to menstruation, and it has become apparent that there are gaps in basic knowledge of the "normal" pattern in the general population. A more reasonable study procedure would involve data collected prospectively and taken from calendar records of women with adequate supervision (WHO, 1969). In this paper, one such study is reported, and the association between age and menstrual cycle length described.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data for the present investigation were obtained from a community survey done during 1969 through 1974 on several aspects of human reproduction. The population samples for this research were taken from the district of North Arcot in Tamil Nadu, India. The details of the sampling plan were described elsewhere (Rao and Inbaraj, 1977). All women were interviewed prospectively at home every five weeks about their menstrual histories, dates of initiation and termination of each menstrual period, the amount of flow, and complaints, if any. Out of three rural and two urban areas, one rural and one urban area were randomly selected for the present research on menstrual patterns. This subset provided 1,740 women on whom details of 4 to 5 consecutive cycles are included in the analysis.
RESULTS
Frequency distribution by age of women included in this study is presented in Table 1. Intra-woman menstrual cycle length variation is presented according to age of women in Table 2. The standard deviation was

nearly 5-6 days in extreme groups and nearly 3 days for the rest (Jeyaseelan, 1988). Taking into account the mean of 4 to 5 consecutive cycles per woman studied, the descriptive statistics on menstrual cycle length by age of women are shown in Table 3. The mean was 31.2 (3.2) days. Sixty per cent of the women have mean cycle lengths between 25 and 31 days and 39 per cent, more than 32 days. From the table, it is clear that the distribution of cycle lengths is skewed to the right.
Frequency distribution and descriptive statistics of cycle lengths according to age of women for all 8,308 cycle lengths are shown in Table 4. The mean (SD) of 8,308 cycle lengths was 31.8 (6.7) days. The range of 25-40 days cycle length constituted 10-82 per cent. The modal frequency for the total distribution was 30 days. Fortyseven per cent of cycle lengths were 25 to 31 days and 43 per cent were more than 31 days. Younger age-groups have longer cycle lengths as compared to others. These findings confirm the results from Table 3.
DISCUSSION
The present study collected data prospectively to ascertain actual dates

of menstruation as done by Chiazze et al. (1968) and Treloar (1973). Although the sample included only currently married women, omitting those unmarried or not living with their husbands, such women constituted less than 1per cent in the reproductive age group (Richard and Rao, 1987). The

relevant information was collected through home visits once every 5 weeks by female interviewers who were fluent in the local language and who had undergone the necessary training. Although the women were illiterate, they were fairly conversant with the local almanac and the various lunar phases, each of which has specific religious significance. During menstruation also, various ritualistic practices are observed. Thus, it was not too difficult to ascertain the beginning and ending dates of menstrual flow in relation to the lunar calendar. From this, the transcription was made to the English calendar.
Mean cycle length of nearly 32 days is significantly different from the studies reported earlier (Chiazze et al.,
