ABSTRACT: A sample of urban Canadian adults who were interviewed and medically examined provided the basis for an exploration of the relation between political behavior and physical stature, general health, and stress. People active in communal and protest political activities showed more stress than, but were otherwise similar to, people who did not participate in such activities. In particular, political actives who were not confident about their effectiveness showed signs of even more stress. People who participated in campaign activities were similar to inactives with respect to signs of stress and general health, but were of smaller stature.

On the other hand, Lasswell has also described the political personality as one that is characterized by an "intense and ungratified craving for deference" (1948, p. 20), which suggests that political actives may be under stress as well. Thus, some of

On the other hand, subordinate animals, particularly if they have been harassed by the dominant members, may show more signs of stress. For example, rats and mice of subordinate status (as measured by the number of fights they have lost) manifest greatest adrenal activity (Barnett, 1955). Indeed, in the mere presence of successful fighters, consistent losers exhibit heightened adrenocortical activity (Bronson and Eleftherion, 1964). Monkeys who are frequently harassed by a dominant partner show high needs for calcium and serum protein (Angermeier et al., 1968). The veracity of the relation be-

(1975) find little relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and political orientations, but they do show that the more fit subjects are less likely to feel high levels of anomia. Funkelstein et al. (1957) suggest that people who respond aggressively have higher levels of noradrenaline while those for whom anxiety is a typical response show elevated adrenaline levels. However, attempts to replicate his findings have not been successful (Frankenhaeuser, 1971).

subordinate in several aspects of their life, but politics is one area in which people are trying to convince others of their point of view, i.e., exercise dominance. While not all individuals who are politically active will have a great deal of impact on other people, we believe that most politically active people are exhibiting behavior that is an expression of attempts to actively implement their policy preferences. Thus, political activity is an appropriate area in which to examine the relationship between dominance and physiological factors.
We analyze interview and physical examination data from a sample of urban Canadian adults for whom we have detailed information on political activity as well as on physical stature, general health, and stress. Prior investigations treat political behavior both as an independent and as a dependent variable. Because no clear causal flow is evident, we somewhat arbitrarily use political behavior as an independent variable, with stress, stature, and health indices as the dependent variables.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE
The data for this study came from a stratified probability sample of Toronto families studied in 1973. A comparison of our sample with 1971 census data shows our sample to be quite representative of Toronto households. For example, according to the 1971 census, 39 per cent of the city's population had a mother tongue other than English; the proportion in the present sample was 41 per cent. The average number of rooms per dwelling according to the census was 5.2; in our sample it was 4.9. The proportion of households having intact families was 71 per cent in the census and 69 per cent in the present sample. We believe that these minor discrepancies do not preclude our generalizing our findings to urban adult family members.

The population sampled was comprised of intact white families of European or North American descent with one or more children in which the wife was under age 45 and who had resided in their present dwelling unit for at least three months. Screening interviews yielded 862 eligible households. In 560 households we were able to interview one or both parents for a 65 per cent completion rate. In all, 856 persons were interviewed. Of the 856, 507 were given physical examinations at a nearby health center.
To determine whether or not those who consented to be examined differed from those who did not in some way that would bias our results, we systematically compared the two groups with respect to health information obtained during the interview and demographic characteristics. Those who received physical exams had a slightly higher socioeconomic status, but in all other respects were the same as those who did not.
POLITICAL VARIABLES
Three types of participation variables were analyzed. Exact wording of the items is as follows.
There are a lot of ways for people to take part in political activities. Some people don't take part at all. Here are a number of things that some people might do. We would like to know if you have done any of these things in the last two years and if you have, how many times. Vote for a political candidate whose ideas you think are good ones? Talk to friends, family, or other people you know to try to get them to vote for or against a candidate or issue? Give money to help someone win an election? Attend rallies, barbeques, meetings, or things like that in connection with an election? Work in a political campaign for a candidate whose ideas you think are good ones?
During the past two years, have you attended any meetings in which tenants rights, problems with landlords, housing code enforcement, public housing or neighborhood renewal were discussed? Are there conditions in your home that you believe make it an unsafe or hazardous place in which to

Vol. 25, No. 2

live? If yes, have you ever talked about these or any kinds of housing problems to a government official or political leader--such as an alderman, housing officer, someone in city hall, or a local party or community leader?
There are many ways for people to show agreement or disagreement with what the government is doing. I would like to know which of these means you approve of. I would also like to know if you have ever used any of these methods. Writing letters to elected officials--members of Parliament, mayors, etc.--or signing a petition; taking a petition around to try to get neighbors and people you know to sign it; going to a meeting at a government office to tell them what you think about something the government is doing; taking part in protest meetings, rallies, or marches which are permitted by local authorities; refusing to obey a law that one thinks is unfair; trying to show the government what you think by taking part in nonviolent sit-ins, mass demonstrations, and things like that which are not permitted by local authorities.
The final three items in the last section were classified as "protest" acts and the remainder as "traditional" acts. A principal axis factor analysis of the fifteen kinds of traditional and protest activities given in the items above revealed four predominant factors. The first factor was comprised of the voting items. We excluded this dimension from our analysis because voting requires a very limited commitment of time and resources. The second factor was a campaignactivism dimension. The third was a dimension including such items as taking a petition around, going to neighborhood meetings, and talking to political officials about local problems. This combination of contacting and cooperative activity is comparable to the communaldimension found by Verba and Nie (1972). The protest activities form a distinct fourth dimension.
A list of the items with the per cent participation in each is found in Table 1. The factor analysis is displayed in Table 2.1 The communal, campaign, and protest

scales were constructed by adding together the number of times the individual took part in each activity. The communal and campaign scales were recoded into three categories: no activity, some activity, and considerable activity. The last category was created by recoding the data so that the category included at least IS per cent of the population, which insured enough people in the active category to carry out the analysis. The correlations between the three variables are modest (ranging from 0.17 to 0.28), indicating that the variables measure different aspects of political participation.

PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES
Presence of communicable, infectious, and stress diseases, or other diseases, was based on responses to a set of 42 symptomatic questions, information obtained by interview and examination by a nurse and a physician, and data based on tests of urine and blood samples obtained at the time of the exam. The height, weight, and girth of the respondent was obtained along with other pertinent pre-exam data. The physicians gave a thorough physical examination which included repeating the pulse

RESULTS

mixed set of findings. On the one hand,

The results suggest that there are few differences between politically active and inactive people either with respect to health, signs of stress, or stature. In all, 22 variables were examined. There were statistically significant (0.0S level) differences between actives and inactives for 10 of the 22 variables in the case of communal activity, and 5 each in the case of campaign and protest activity. While the number of statistically significant differences are more than the three that we would expect to find by chance, the differences are small in magnitude and somewhat inconsistent in direction.

communal actives have lower blood pressure and fewer stress diseases than do people less involved in communal political activities. On the other hand, the actives have higher levels of serum uric acid, adrenaline, and noradrenaline, consume sedative-hypnotic drugs more often, score higher on the psychiatric impairment index, and females score higher on the uterine disorder index. There are no appreciable differences on the other stress indicators. Clearly, those heavily involved in communal activities are under some stress. However, the stress is such that it has not manifested itself in the long-term indicators such as high blood pressure and

stress as people uninvolved in protest activities. However, many of the short-term indicators (uterine disorders, alcohol consumption, psychiatric impairment index) indicate that actives experience more stress than inactives. In short, people active in protest activities have the same stature and general health as less active people, but they show more short-term signs of stress.
CAMPAIGN ACTIVITY
While people active in campaign work tend to be shorter and lighter than less involved individuals,2 both the physical exam data and the self-report health information suggest that actives are no more or less healthy than other people. The stress indicators show a similar trend. Only 3 of the 14 indicators suggest any difference between actives and inactives. Systolic blood pressure and eosinophil count suggest actives are under less stress than inactive people, while the serum adrenaline indicator shows the reverse trend. We may conclude that people active in political campaigns enjoy the same health and experience the same amount of stress as those who are inactive.
In sum, we find people who are active in communal and protest activities show more signs of short-term stress than do their inactive counterparts, but are similar to nonparticipants when it comes to physical stature and health. On the other hand, people who participated in campaign activities display no more stress symptoms than people inactive in this realm, but they are of smaller stature. The reason for the difference in stature is not readily apparent.
2 Dividing the sample by sex, we still find that actives weigh less (significantly less among the women, but only slightly less among the men) and are shorter. This latter difference is significant among the men and very small in the sample of women.

SOURCES OF STRESS
To examine further the origin of stress among political actives, we recomputed the equations for people scoring high on a scale of political efficacy and for those scoring low. People were asked whether they agree or disagree with the following items: "It seems to me that whoever you vote for, things go on pretty much the same"; "Nothing I ever do seems to have any effect upon what happens in politics"; "No matter what people think, a few people will always run things anyway." Individuals who disagreed with one or more items were categorized as scoring high on political efficacy. While a person disagreeing with only one item may not feel especially efficacious, we chose this cutoff point to insure that we had enough cases in each analysis.
Inspection of the data in Table 4 suggests that stress observed among the political actives is found more among the inefficacious than the efficacious. For example, in the analysis of communal political participation, actives with feelings of limited efficacy show more indications of stress than actives who feel efficacious. The nine stress indicators in which this difference is particularly apparent are: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline, infectious diseases, alcohol and drug use, and psychiatric impairment. Three indicators have similar values for efficacious and nonefficacious actives, and two stress indicators (uterine disorders and stress diseases) have a pattern which is not consistent with this interpretation.
An examination of participation in protest activities reveals a similar pattern for 11 out of the 14 stress indicators. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, thyroxine, eosinophil count, cholesterol, adrenaline, stress and infectious diseases, alcohol and drug consumption, and psychiatric impairment are consistent with our interpre-

tation. Only the uric acid measure is an exception to this pattern, while two other measures show little difference. In other words, politically active people (except those doing campaign work) who feel that their efforts are generally effective are less prone to show signs of stress. In some cases there may be a conspicuous absence of stress. On the other hand, political actives who are not confident about their effectiveness show more signs of stress. Why people who are not confident about the effect of their work continue a high level of political participation is an intriguing question, but one we cannot answer with the data at hand.

Clearly, we cannot generalize our findings to political elites. Few of the people in our sample are politicians on a full-time basis. Were we to have a subsample of full-time politicians to compare with our sample, it is possible that we might find patterns that more closely parallel the findings of ethological studies of nonhuman species where the leaders tend to be larger, stronger, and in better health than nonleaders.
However, even were we able to isolate such differences, it would be difficult to attribute them to interspecies similarities. In a comparison of pecking orders in chickens and human status relations, Masur (1973, p. SIS) observes:

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
We find that people who are politically involved in communal and protest activities show more signs of short-term stress than do individuals not so involved. The signs of stress are most pronounced among actives with a low sense of political efficacy. No other differences in health or stature are apparent. Campaign actives are no different than inactives with respect to health and stress, but the former are found to be of shorter stature than the latter.
Why those involved in campaign activities do not show the same signs of stress as do people active in communal and protest activities is not clear. We may speculate that the initiative required by campaign activities (talking to friends, giving money) is less than that required by protest or communal activities. Campaign activities are fairly routine and structured. Why campaign actives should be of smaller stature than nonactives is equally puzzling. While discrimination against short people has been documented (Feldman 1975), it is difficult to see how discrimination is operating in this particular arena.

It is difficult to interpret the chicken-human comparisons. Similarities are interesting, but the differences are striking. One can always make analogies between any two species; but one cannot always tell if the analogies are meaningful, particularly when the two species are widely separated on the phylogenetic tree.
He goes on to note that:
Behaviors that are on the surface similar may be based on dissimilar mechanisms, so the analogy has little substance.
In comparing human political behavior to status behavior among animals, there are certainly important differences that stand out. Dominance among humans may rely upon intelligence and organizational skill and is unlikely to be a function of simple physical prowess. Furthermore, among humans the notion of dominance is less clear-cut than in animal societies. Most people are dominant in some aspects of their social relationships and subordinate in others; few are either subordinate in all or dominant in all. Dominance or subordination in political life probably plays a relatively minor role in the lives of most individuals. Thus, the effect of the presence or absence of political activity on
