Post (1962) has suggested that selection against sex-linked color blindness has relaxed under certain ecological conditions resulting from cultural growth. This hypothesis is based on the high frequencies of color blindness in Europe, the Middle East, and Far East contrasted with low frequencies among a number of primitive populations. While the published data on color vision among populations in different stages of cultural growth generally support this hypothesis, there are, nevertheless, exceptions among primitive (Rivers, 1905; Sarkar, 1958; Fernandes et al., 1957) and rural (Dronamraju and Meera Khan, 1961) populations. The published results should be regarded with certain reservations, since the use of different techniques by different workers may introduce bias in the comparisons of various populations.
The purpose of the present study has been to determine the frequencies of color blindness among populations in different cultural stages from three eastern states of India and to evaluate their significance in relation to the relaxation hypothesis as postulated by Post (1962).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
During 1963-64, 2,917 male students from 13 high schools in the states of West

Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa were screened by the author, using Ishihara plates Nos. 1-25 (1960 edition).
Urban population. In Calcutta, West Bengal, 843 students were screened from 3 missionary schools. The city of Calcutta was founded by traders of the British East India Company in 1694, or approximately ten generations ago, and is now considered India's largest urban center with a cosmopolitan population from different parts of the country. The majority of the students tested belong to Anglo-Indian, upper-caste Bengali, Chinese, Punjabi, and Muslim populations. The Chinese have been residents of Calcutta for some four or five generations.
Rural population. In rural Orissa, 1,703 students were screened from 8 public schools in the coastal district of Puri. The students belong to various castes and subcastes.
Tribal population. To obtain a sample from tribal populations, 371 students were screened from 2 missionary schools in Ranchi, Bihar, and from a boarding school in Bhubaneswar, Orissa. The students from Orissa belong to different tribes, and their birthplaces cover almost the entire state of Orissa.
The overall prevalence of color blindness in the present study is 0.037 (109/2917). Of the 109 color-blind males, 32 are protan and

77 deuteran. It is convenient to treat the present material in three broad categories classified according to the degree of urbanization: (a) Urban, (b) Rural, and (c) Tribal. Table 1 summarizes the data and shows a slightly higher incidence of color blindness among Urban males. However, as shown in Table 2, this difference is not statistically significant (x2 = 1.81, p < 0.50), nor is the prevalence rate in the Urban populations (0.042, based on 843 students) strikingly higher than the incidence among pooled samples of rural and tribal populations (0.035, based on total of 2,074 students). There is an uneven distribution of color blindness among rural groups (x2 = 22.69, p < 0.001), with the highest incidence in the lowest castes (see Table 3). The deuteran-protan ratios for Urban, Rural, and Tribal groups are 4:1, 2:0, and 1:5, respectively.
INFLUENCE OF CASTE
The concept of caste came from four varnas (colors): Brahmin (Priest and Teacher), Khatriya (Warrior), Vaishya (Trader), and Sudra (Cultivator). Each caste belongs to one of these varnas, and traditionally most castes and subcastes engaged in a particular occupation. It is not castes, but subcastes, that are genetically isolated groups. The hierarchical structure of the caste system restricts not only intermarriage but also social and ritual intercourse between them. For purposes of the present study, the castes from rural Orissa have been classified as Upper, Middle, and Lower according to their social distance. Gene diffusion from Upper to Middle or Middle to Lower and vice-versa is very rare, although the chance of gene diffusion from Middle to Upper is greater than from Lower to Middle. Thus, the classification of caste suggested here has a biological basis and would seem useful for the analysis of the rural population of India.

The most outstanding feature emerging from Table 1 is the high rate (0.15) of color blindness within the Low-caste group in rural Orissa. This prevalence among the Low-caste group might be due to random genetic drift in these castes because of their small population sizes. As these castes are homogeneously "high," it would seem more likely that the four populations (Bhoi, Hadi, Dhoba, and Kandara) of the Low-caste group have shared a common gene pool in the past and that the original gene frequencies have persisted after their separation. These populations have racial and cultural affinities.
The Middle-caste group is not far from the Upper caste, with a prevalence rate of 0.030 and 0.033 respectively. The Middle caste is unique in showing significant heterogeneity, although the variances do not differ significantly between the five population groups (p = 0.2 according to Bartlett's test). The high incidence of color blindness among four Middle-caste populations (Malia, Buallisi, Gudia, and Bhandari) of small size may have been established by chance and then perpetuated. Genetic drift is also possible. It may be mentioned that the Malia and Buallisi with their small population size (around 1,500 and 2,000, respectively) carefully avoid cousin marriages and are confined to one or two settlements of Puri district, Orissa. Very little can be said about the frequencies among tribal populations, as the samples are very small.
SELECTION INTENSITIES
Analyzing the variance in color blindness frequency into various components we obtain Table 4. The two degrees of freedom among the three populations yield a nonsignificant regression on "Urbanism" (taken to be 1, 0, and --1 arbitrarily for the three populations) and a nonsignificant residual.

A similar analysis for the three caste groups in the rural populations yields a significant residual only, pointing to a "random" heterogeneity rather than to a consistent influence of "civilization." A similar heterogeneity is present among the "castes" (this term taken to denote all the lowest subdivisions mentioned in Table 1) within the caste groups.
In view of the finding of different prevalences of color blindness in different popula-

tions, it is of some interest to try to calculate the intensities of selection that would be needed to produce such differences in gene frequencies. Dr. W. S. Volkers has calculated the intensities of selection that would be needed to produce these differences. We will derive some general formulas (implicitly used by Post [1962]) and apply them to the urban-tribal difference.
Using a continuous model of slow twoallele selection, we may designate:

are at least on the order of 10%; but we have to keep in mind that the gene frequency differences in fact are not significant, so neither are such quantities derived from them as V and Jo or Jo -- J.
To explain the low incidence of the colorblindness gene or genes in lower stages of culture and to understand its relationship to biological fitness, we must consider the rate of inbreeding (for female gene frequency), population size, family size, migration rate, rate of incidence in different age and occupational groups, and sample size, which might give us evidence of selection. The need for large samples is clear and presents obvious difficulties. It is unlikely that the role of selection can be understood unless studies are planned and evaluated properly. Post (1962) suggests that color blindness is a greater handicap in primitive

208 Ray Social Biology

populations than in higher levels of culture. However, Penrose (1959) suggests that "uncovering" of cryptic coloration by redgreen color blindness might have been advantageous to primitive hunting men and that in modern warfare the color-blind may sometimes be of use in picking out camouflaged targets. Commenting on Post's analysis, Ford (1965) remarks that redgreen color blindness could not have reached the status of polymorphism unless the gene responsible for the condition had been associated with advantages as well as disadvantages. On the other hand, Clarke (1965) comments that red-green color blindness now seems to be a neutral trait.
While the present material falls in line

with Post's hypothesis, the difference in the frequency of color blindness in long civilized, as contrasted to recently civilized, populations is not statistically significant. Moreover, the finding of significant heterogeneities, explicable as drift and founder effects, calls for caution in the interpretation of data on the distribution of color blindness among small tribal and non-tribal isolates.
