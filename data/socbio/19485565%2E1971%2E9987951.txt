The frequency of congenital malformations (CM) reflects the presence of teratogenic and/or mutagenic agents in the environment, in addition to other factors playing a role in the polygenic multifactorial system. Thus, changes in the frequency of CM may indicate variations of known teratogens (rubella) and mutagens (irradiation), or lead to the discovery of unknown ones (Contergan till 1962). These changes are probably represented by a spectrum of movements being closely related to the strength and natural occurrence of teratogens and/or mutagens. Several studies treating this problem have been published (Petersen, 1934; McKeown and Record, 1951; Kratchman and Grahn, 1959; Edwards, 1961, 1964; Keselman and Bailar, 1964; Lenz, 1965; Annonation in Lancet, 1964).
It is the purpose of this paper to (1) show how malformation frequencies fluctuate in time and space, (2) propose definitions for these types of movements, and (3) demonstrate the value of studying these changes.

MOVEMENTS IN TIME
LONG-TEEM MOVEMENT
This is a continuous increase or decrease in the frequency of a CM. As a rule it is slow and lasts for decades. Two examples demonstrate this type of movement.
During the past fifteen years the frequency of CM of the central nervous system (CNS) in the State of New York decreased by 50-60%. The reasons for the decline in frequency of these CM remain obscure (Gittelsohn and Milham, 1962). Genetic or environmental factors were not obvious. It seems also that the age of the mothers could not play a decisive role in influencing the decrease in frequency. Only an increase in birth rates in the south (up 59.5% from 1945 to 1959) was notable, in comparison with the relatively small increase in birth rates in the north of the state (up 14.7%, compared to a rise of 27.8% in the western part of the state). Perhaps just in this demographic change may lie the key to the explanation of movements in the frequency of CNS CM. The cause might be related to the influence of emigration of

As another example, the decrease in pyloric stenosis frequency in Sweden can be used (Wallgren, 1960) (Table 2). This

movement was observed in the population of Gothenburg. The resultant difference calculated for 83,873 births was statistically significant. In this case also, yearly differences were not pronounced, and some transient increase in frequency during this period may even be noted. The trend, however, is definite. It was observed not only in Sweden, but also in other European countries. The cause of this longterm one-way movement is unknown.
It is of interest to examine Down's syndrome in thinking of long-term movement of CM. In this instance, incidence is known to correlate with mother's age (see Table 3). Thus, in a population like

that of Czechoslovakia where the number of women giving birth after age 35 has declined over the past thirty years to onehalf its former value, it is logical to assume that the incidence of Down's syndrome has also declined over the same
time period,

limbs in the years 1961-62 was this particular medication. Another example is the increase of anencephalus, spina bifida, and hydrocephalus in some parts of Germany during World War II and for about five years thereafter. Later, the number of these types of CM returned to normal, having at their peaks reached three to four times the original figures (Eichmann and Gesenius, 1952; Nowak, 19S0; Pfau and Träger, 1962; Winter and Pätz, 1958). No explanation for this type of movement is available. Changes in the age structure of mothers cannot explain these findings,

while other factors like undernourishment and stress were not objectively measured and therefore cannot be used in the analysis. The number of illegitimate children was rather high during that time. It is an interesting fact that the frequency of anencephalus did not increase in Hamburg during the war (Lenz, 1965); in Japan an actual decrease of all CM's was noted during World War II (Mitami, 1954).
There are several other examples of this phenomenon: Leek and Millar (1963) in a longterm observation noted an increase in the frequency of hypospadias, cleft palate,

and reducing deformities of the radius and thumb in the period from July, 1957 to March, 1959. They did not discover the cause. Knox (1959) and Kucera (1965) documented a deviation in the frequency of oesophageal atresia of very short duration. However, they could not determine the cause of these atresias. Mellin and Katzenstein (1964) published a deviation in the frequency of spina bifida when in a period from 1946 to 1962 15 infants with spina bifida amongst 15,333 newborns were born, three of these cases in February, 1962.
Other examples could be cited, for example, clustering of chromosomal aberrations (Fr0land, 1967; Mikamo, 1968; Pantelakis et al., 1970; Robinson et al., 1969; and Robinson and Puck, 1965), and even of leukemia (Day, 1966).
The above patterns of the time-limited deviations illustrate the characteristic types of movements for which we most often have no etiologic explanation. The movement lasts from several months to sev-

eral years and is commonly called "clustering," "short-term change," or "accumulation." It apparently lasts as long as the effects of the "toxins" on the organogenetic period. We presume that in the majority of cases, if not always, the teratogen was brought into the environment, for example, microbes or factors of civilization.
SEASONAL MOVEMENTS AND CYCLIC CHANGES
These are deviations of varying duration which are periodically repeated, for example, every year. The survey of Bailar and Gurian (1965) reveals that yearly cycles may be most often observed in anencephalus, in some malformations of the heart, and in hip joint dislocation.
An example from Czechoslovakia (see Figure 1) demonstrates the situation in five maternity hospitals situated at a distance of some hundred kilometers from each other, from the period 1957 to 1965. There is continuous increase in the frequency of CM in the three hospitals

recorded until 1959, then a decrease followed (Getlik, 1963; Kluka, 1966, personal communication; Srseñ and Fric, 1964, personal communication; Novotná, 1968, personal communication; Znellerová et al., 1963). The continuing later records from the fourth and fifth hospitals again show correspondences in the rise and fall of CM frequency.
Stoller and Collmann (1965) published an example of several years of cyclic changes of Down's syndrome. The frequency of this syndrome increased in the years 1942-64 three times in the Province of Victoria, always at intervals of 5 to 7 years. Infectious hepatitis was suggested to be closely related to these changes.
This type of movement is not very uniform since the provoking causes are not of the same nature and, in addition, are acting in different time periods (e.g., before conception, at conception and during embryogenesis). Insufficient knowledge of cyclic movements is due to inadequate methods of observation and computation.

3. A strong teratogen in the environment (e.g., rubella virus)
4. Unknown effects of the environment, both biologic and nonbiologic (viruses and other microorganisms, poisons of civilization, and others).
The mentioned agents are not overlooked if they operate epidemically. However, it is more difficult to prove them if they act endemically or sporadically. All factors (whether recognized or not) influence the frequency of the individual types of CM. In the majority of cases they are apparently exogenous factors brought into the environment and superimposed upon genetic ones which in number and vertical propagation are relatively constant.
MOVEMENTS IN SPACE
The movement in frequency of CM in time is connected with the movement of frequency in space. Often it is impossible to separate them. If in spite of this, some examples of movements in space are presented here, it is because they have some pecularities which do not exist for movements in time.

CONCLUSIONS ON MOVEMENTS IN TIME
IN FREQUENCIES OF CONGENITAL
MALFORMATIONS
Causes of the origin of CM do not al-
ways show an even and regular activity
and may strongly affect the frequency of
some CM. The following factors may be
concerned and thus taken in consideration
when analysis of materials collected is
performed:
1. Demographic factors a. changes in the age structure of women bearing children b. changes in number of children in families c. immigration of new ethnic groups d. other factors, e.g., density of inhabitants per square mile, prevailing type of economic activity of inhabitants, etc.
2. A strong mutagen in the environment (e.g., radiation, chemicals)

SPACE CLUSTERING
This is a massing or accumulation of CM at a certain place without regard to time dimensions. The distance between the single cases of CM from each other is minimal. Pleydell (1960) quotes examples from Northamptonshire where he discovered some clusters of anencephalus and of heart anomalies both in limited rural areas and in towns--in the latter, even on particular streets. A possible time-space clustering of conjoined twins (with seasonal effect on incidence) was published by Milham (1966).
BREAK IN FREQUENCY
This is a relatively rapid, locally limited change in frequency. The addition of iodine to salt in the Apenzell Canton (Swit-

zerland), brought about a permanent drop in the frequency of CM and other disorders of fetal development.
HOMOGENEITY OF FREQUENCY OF CM
Inside large regional complexes there are differences between the smaller regional units in the frequency of CM. If the lowest and highest frequencies are fairly close to each other, we call it high homogeneity. On the contrary, if there is a considerable difference between the highest and lowest frequency, we call it low homogeneity (Kucera & Pelesková, 1964). Figure 2 shows low, middle, and high homogeneity for CM in three regions of Czechoslovakia. At first we explained this phenomenon as representing errors of too small numbers, but we encountered it repeatedly. So far we do not know whether it will last or disappear. We presume preliminarily that high homogeneity is in-

dicative of a population isolate; middle homogeneity is a characteristic sign for balanced populations (panmixia) living in standard environments; low homogeneity rather indicates an irregular scattering of teratogens and is probably also proof of biologically atypical populations. It should be stressed that comparable samples in terms of numbers are necessary for analyzing homogeneity.
The movements in frequencies of CM in space therefore may be induced by imposed causes as well as be fixed by the place. Very often it was originally a movement in time, which was arrested at new values. In this way the local geographic difference occurs.
DISCUSSION
Classification of movements in frequencies of CM according to exogenous phenomena shows that we are able to

differentiate already some peculiarities which were hitherto merged in one. The classification is not a final one; further observations are needed.
Let us consider the mentioned deviation in the frequency of hypospadias, palatoschisis, and reducing deformities of the radius (Leek and Millar, 1963). Does it mean that these CM are controlled by the same gene loci and that just this particular genetic material was selectively damaged? In this connection it is of interest to scan the material gained by analysis of 1,059 siblings of 936 probands with hypospadias born between Jan. 1, 1961 and Dec. 31, 1964 in Czechoslovakia (Table 4). The differences in frequencies of the mentioned CM are conspicuous (but not statistically significant) and might indicate that the

findings in Birmingham (1957-61) and in Czechoslovakia (1961-64), obtained in different ways, reflect a stable mechanism of the polygenic multifactorial system.
More analogous cases probably exist, but they will not come to our attention until there is continuous reporting of CM. Studies of CM should be based on adequate material with completeness of reporting of CM and objectivity of documentation for single CM cases. The screening of CM should last for an adequate period so that it can intercept a sufficiently numerous sample of population. The minimal time should be four to five years and the minimal number of births, forty to fifty thousand.
The interpretation of the material implies a knowledge of basic demographic
