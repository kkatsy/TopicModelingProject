ABSTRACT: The relationship between early fetal wastage or stillbirth and pregnancy spacing was examined in a population characterized by prolonged lactation, minimal nutrition, and high fertility and mortality. The highest risk of early fetal death was found among those pregnancies conceived less than twelve months after the birth of a surviving breast-fed infant. Lactation as a possible causal factor is discussed. A significant inverse relationship was apparent for second trimester fetal deaths and pregnancy intervals, but not for third trimester deaths. This finding is surprising when one considers that fetal weight gain, and presumably nutrient demand, increases most rapidly during the third trimester.

The objective of this analysis is to determine the relationship between early fetal wastage or stillbirth and pregnancy spacing in a Bangladeshi population characterized by prolonged lactation, minimal nutrition, and high fertility and mortality. Most previous studies on the relationship between fetal death and pregnancy spacing have shown that fetal mortality is higher among pregnancies preceded by either short or prolonged intervals (Shapiro, 1970; Yerushalmy et al., 1956; Federick and Alderstein, 1973; Eastman, 1944).
Several possible mechanisms have been suggested for the increased risk of fetal death among pregnancies occurring after short intervals. Maternal resources are depleted by a rapid succession of pregnancies which make the mother less able to carry a pregnancy successfully to term and produce a viable infant (Yerushalmy et al., 19S6; Eastman, 1944). There is an abundance of literature showing that both pregnancy and lactation utilize available maternal resources at the mother's expense (Hytten and Leitch, 1964; Josimovich et al., 1974; Metz, 1970; Winich, 1971).

Concurrent lactation and pregnancy would accelerate the depletion of maternal resources. No evidence was found in the literature to suggest whether pregnancy or lactation would take priority if both are competing for maternal reserves. The possibility that lactation may interfere with a subsequent pregnancy is based primarily on inferences from one animal study showing that implantation was delayed in rats that conceived while still lactating (Hafez and Ishibashi, 1965).
Insufficient time for endometrial regeneration after a pregnancy termination may interfere with successful implantation (Vilee, 1960). Lactational amenorrhea is the major factor responsible for delaying pregnancy in this essentially noncontracepting population. Therefore, women with an infant or fetal death would conceive again soon, possibly perpetuating a series of unsuccessful pregnancies (Chen, Gesche, et al., 1974; Chen, Ahmed, et al., 1974).

All births, deaths, and migrations from the 132 villages of Matlab, known as the "Old Trial Area," are recorded on a daily basis. The registration system is maintained primarily for the surveillance of diarrheal diseases by the Cholera Research Laboratory field hospital in Matlab. However, the comprehensive recording of births and deaths provides valuable data for fertility and mortality analysis.
An individual Vaccine Trial Serial number (VTS number) is assigned to each mother in the registration system. Each recorded pregnancy termination also contains the mother's VTS number, making it

determination of the fetus. If the mother missed four to six menstrual cycles, nonlive birth was classified as an early fetal wastage; if she missed seven to nine cycles, the event was classified as a stillbirth. If the mother missed three or fewer cycles, the event was not recorded as a pregnancy termination. The recording of fetal deaths is limited to second and third trimester fetal deaths detected by the mother. The estimates of gestation are subject to all the possible sources of error associated with menstrual histories (Chiazze et al., 1968; Hobson, 1966; Kamm and Beernich, 1962).

of self-induced abortion (Shorter, and Bozkurt, 1969). A review of fetal death records in Matlab showed thai only about 3 per cent of all fetal deaths were described as induced abortions and/or illegitimate pregnancies. Since there was a daily surveillance of the villages by the field staff, it was assumed that most successful induced abortions would have been detected.
Estimates of fetal deaths among all recorded pregnancy terminations was about 10 per cent. Estimates of fetal wastage from other epidemiological studies vary between S to 20 per cent of all pregnancy terminations (Abrahamson, 1973b; James, 1970).
Fetal deaths, although underenumerated because all first trimester fetal deaths were excluded from the registration system, appear to have been accurately classified as early fetal deaths (second trimester) or stillbirths (third trimester fetal deaths). Consistent with other studies, these data indicate that more than twice as many fetal deaths occur in the second as in the third trimester (Abrahamson, 19736; French and Bierman, 1962; Hammes and Treolar, 1970; James, 1970; Mellin, 1962; Shapiro et al., 1962).

BINARY REGRESSION ANALYSIS
A binary regression analysis was used to adjust for selected maternal factors (pregnancy order, age of the mother, history of previous pregnancy and child losses, and outcome of the first pregnancy of the interval). The adjusted rates of early fetal wastage and stillbirth represent the risk of an individual in that interval category experiencing an early fetal wastage or a stillbirth given that the other selected maternal factors are held constant.
When the independent and dependent variables are binary, the regression can be expressed by the following general linear model where each Xti represents a subclass

The significant difference between the adjusted rates for two subclasses were determined by the following computation which treats the differences between the two adjusted rates like the differences between two means.
The Z statistic is assumed to follow a standard normal distribution; ARy and AR2 are the adjusted rates from the two subclasses being SEARl and SEAR2 are the standard errors of the two adjusted rates. The level of significance was taken at the 0.05 level.

(Table 2). It is difficult to make conclusions where the preceding event was an infant death (LBD) or a nonlive birth (NLB) because of the small number of cases with an interval greater than twelve months following an LBD or an NLB. There is probably some undetected fetal wastage in the longer intervals, especially those following an infant death or a nonlive birth. Since the maximal period of follow-up was sixty months and fewer than twenty cases had intervals longer than thirty-six months, the relationship between prolonged intervals and the risk of fetal mortality was not evaluated in more detail in this study.
The specific effects of previous pregnancy losses on the relationship between the length of the interval and fetal mortality is examined in Table 3. The history of

stillbirth mortality in the previous pregnancy loss categories.
DISCUSSION
The findings differ from previous studies in several ways. First, the large difference (six-fold) in early fetal wastage between short and long intervals waslargely accounted for by the group preceded by a surviving, breast-fed infant (Table 2). Lactation data were not available on this study population, but a prospective study of two hundred women from Matlab found that 93 per cent of women with a surviving live birth were breast-feeding, at least partially, up to twelve months post-partum. These observations suggest that lactation may be a causal factor. There are three possible reasons for such

previous pregnancy losses is of particular importance since it is closely associated both with the length of intervals between pregnancies and with risk of fetal mortality (Abrahamson, 1973a,b; Kamm and Beernich, 1962; Shapiro, 1970). Early fetal wastage and stillbirth rates areconsistently higher among the pregnancies of mothers with a history of two or more pregnancy losses. However, those pregnancies preceded by short intervals have the highest risk of both early fetal and

(1) Lactation may interfere with a subsequent pregnancy if the second pregnancy occurs while lactation is still intensive since many of the critical endocrine and metabolic changes of pregnancy occur during the first two months. The lack of information on first trimester fetal deaths limits this interpretation. Nevertheless, if one assumes that the distribution of fetal deaths is the same in this population as in others, the trends observed among second trimester fetal
