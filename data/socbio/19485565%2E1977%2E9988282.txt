ABSTRACT: When sophisticated medical attention substantially increases the life expectancy of individuals with a severe homozygous condition without significantly raising their reproductive success, an increase in parental investment should render a concomitant decrease in parental ability to reproductively compensate. This process will lower the expected number of heterozygous carriers produced by heterozygous parents and, in turn, will lower the equilibrium frequency of the gene.

productive success, for children who are nonreproductive if such children do not consume much PI. For example, a conceptus that is spontaneously (or therapeutically) aborted in the first trimester is not likely to have consumed an amount of PI that will significantly affect a parent's total reproductive success. The relationship between PI and reproductive compensation is inverse while the relationship between longevity and PI is direct (Figures 1 and 2).
The importance of this consideration lies in its effect on the fitness of a gene that is lethal in the homozygous state, but which does not directly affect the reproductive success of heterozygous carriers (does not reduce the size of the F j generation). In this situation, the longevity of the

homozygote can affect the number of hétérozygotes produced by carrier parents. That is, a long-lived high-PI-consuming homozygote will have a greater negative effect on his parent's reproductive success than will a short-lived low-PI-consuming homozygote.
If the prevailing medical environment greatly increases the life expectancy of a homozygote, it can be seen that such an environment will increase the disadvantage of the heterozygous parents. As a hypothetical example, consider two sets of parents (A and B) in which: (1) each parent carries the gene that is lethal in the homozygous state; (2) each couple has the PI resources required by four normal children; (3) the couples live under extremely disparate medical conditions; and (4) the

Heterozygote-heterozygote crosses would normally occur with frequency y2, producing offspring in a 1:2:1 ratio. If, however, the recessive a is lethal and parents are able to completely compensate for homozygous recessive offspring, two heterozygous parents will produce offspring in numbers proportional to their mating frequency, but in a 1:2 ratio, AA:Aa.

care relative to a situation of reproductive compensation.
If medical care not only extends the longevity of homozygous récessives, but also gives them a chance to reproduce, the hypothesized effect is quickly lost. The outcome would be dysgenic relative to the situation of total reproductive compensa-

The value of r at which the situation becomes dysgenic depends on the associated value of s (Figure 4).
EXAMPLE
Cystic fibrosis is an important example (=1 in 20 Caucasians is a carrier) of a recessive alíele whose heterozygous fitness could be negatively affected by medical care. In 1938 the expected survival of homozygotes at 10 years of age was 1per cent (Warwick and Poque, 1969), with an expected mean longevity of less than 1 year (Bowman, 1976). Today the expected survival at 12 years is 72 per cent(Holzel, 1975) in the United States, and 45 per cent at 20 years in Great Britain (Mearns, 1974), with a mean survival of 16 years (Bowman, 1976). While cystic fibrosis homozygotes have gained considerable longevity, their fertility remains negligible for purposes of significantly affecting the gene frequency (Taussig et al., 1972; Denning et al., 1968; Kaplan et al., 1968; Feigelson et al., 1969; Bumbalo, 1969; Rule et al., 1970; Holsclaw et al., 1971; Grand et al., 1966; Rosenow and Lee, 1968; Oppenheimer and Esterly, 1970).

LIFE EXPECTANCY
FIG. 4.--As medical care extends the life of homozygous récessives, the amount of PI they consume increases and the resultant eugenic effect is enhanced. However, as life expectancy extends beyond reproductive maturity (M) and homozygotes reproduce, the trend is reversed. Whether and when the effect becomes dysgenic depends on the amount of PI consumed by the homozygous recessive in attaining reproductive maturity.
anemia (HbS) homozygotes probably have sufficient reproductive success to counter any negative effect on their heterozygous parents (Billina and Bickers, 1974; Karayalcin et al., 1975; Powars, 1975; Anderson, 1971; Gima and Lee, 1975). In contrast to the HbS homozygote, whose fertility depends largely on medical care, HbC homozygotes have probably always had a sufficient probability of normal reproduction (Powars, 1975; Anderson, 1971; Gima and Lee, 1975; River et al., 1961). Like HbS homozygotes, information on HbC homozygotes has often been based on hospital populations, and the severity of the condition has been overestimated accordingly (Billina and Bickers, 1974; Powars, 1975; Gima and Lee, 1975; River et al., 1961; Attah et al., 1975). In contrast to both HbS and HbSC, severe homozygous ß-thalassemia (thalassemia major, Cooky's anemia), especially in the form common to non-Black populations, exemplifies a condition for which extensive medical care greatly increases longevity without rendering significant re-

productive success (Houston, 1974; Pearson and O'Brien, 1975; Necheles et al., 1974; Piomelli et al., 1974; Sloman, 1974; Canale et al., 1974). Carter et al. (1971) and Sultz et al. (1972) report data for the sickle hemopathies and cystic fibrosis which indicate an absence of reproductive compensation (Sultz et al., 1972) or even negative compensation (Carter et al., 1971).
While medical treatment of some conditions has been so successful as to counter the hypothesized eugenic effect (e.g., HbS anemia and PKU deficiency) by sufficiently raising the expected fertility of homozygotes, other conditions are not yet sufficiently well treated to affect parental ability to reproductively compensate. Tay-Sachs disease exemplifies a condition which may soon move out of this category and into the category of a disease whose frequency will diminish as a by-product of more effective medical care and increased longevity.
Of course, the sword of the medical insignia is double-edged, and the eugenic effect hypothesized here, no matter how strongly it applies in reality, can not counter the potential dysgenic effect of amniocentesis; that is, if therapeutic abortions are elected only when the fetus is homozygous for a deleterious recessive, and not in the case of carrier fetuses, then the paradigm becomes: Therapeutic Abortionf--»Homozygote Longevity!--» Hétérozygote Parental Investment],--» Hétérozygote Reproductive Compensation!--»Hétérozygote Selective Disadvantage!--»Gene Frequency! (cf. Hagy and Kidwell, 1972; Fraser, 1972a, 19726). Although complete reproductive compensation is likely to raise the equilibrium frequency of a recessive lethal, it is unlikely, as originally hypothesized by Lewontin (1953), to raise frequency levels to those generally attributed to balanced polymorphism (cf. Williams, 1959).
