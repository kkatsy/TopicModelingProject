is predominantly Catholic, being the only state with a majority of its citizens adhering to that faith. The proportion of women with more than a high school education is quite small, and other studies concentrating on Rhode Island have found a strong relationship between educational attainment and religious affiliation. That is to say, non-Catholics are much more likely to have had some college training than Catholics.

Female respondents were asked: "Have you ever heard of oral contraceptives . . . the pill that some women use to delay or prevent pregnancy or to regulate their periods?" and: "Have you ever used these pills?" Those replying affirmatively were then asked: "Are (were) you using the pill at least partly to delay or prevent pregnancy?" In this study only those who indicated its use for birth control purposes are considered "Users." As noted in Table 2,

The 1970 follow-up survey cannot be viewed as a representative sample of the state's population in that year. I t misses those women who attained the age of SO since their original interviews. It does not include the newly married women who entered the pertinent "universe" since 1967-69. As is often the case with panel studies, a number of respondents could not be reached in 1970, and some did not cooperate in the follow-up. About 16% of the original panel members were not interviewed in 1970 and these have not been replaced. Nevertheless, the data in Table 1 suggest that the respondent loss was not biased by religion or education, but the proportion of older women is smaller in the follow-up than in the original samples.
RESULTS
CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS
The interviews of 1967-69 included a series of questions on oral contraceptives.

the proportion presently using the pill has declined since 1967 when 18.0% of all the women were users. By 1969, the proportion was only 14.7%. Controlling for age does not eliminate this pattern for those under 40. Among women under 30, the proportion of current users declined from 28.9% in 1967 to 21.1%in 1969.
Educational attainment of women is an important variable that must be considered when analyzing family planning behavior. As Ryder and Westoff have stated, it is a "variable of major relevance for the adoption of a new method of contraception" (1971, p. 146). It is often noted that the diffusion process generally begins with the better educated and then filters down to those with less schooling (Rodgers, 1962). Such a pattern was found in the 1965 study --22% of the college graduates being current users compared to 7% of those with only a grade school education. Ryder and Westoff (1971, p. 147) concluded that this

"probably reflect [s] the greater awareness of and receptivity to innovation that are generally cultivated by education."
The Rhode Island data on pill usage by educational attainment of the women are summarized in Table 3. These cross-

69% of the respondents professed the Catholic faith. Despite the controversy concerning the theological propriety of oral contraception, there is evidence that Catholic women are increasingly using birth control methods not approved by their

sectional analyses by year of survey are limited to two categories because of the small number of women who have gone beyond high school in each of these years. Thus, these findings must be viewed with caution. In 1967, high school graduates were almost twice as likely to be users of the pill as were those without a completed secondary school education. However, this variation diminishes in 1968 and 1969 when the better educated become less oriented to the pill while the less educated remain relatively stable in their usage. Especially noteworthy is the evidence that the proportion of high school graduates taking the pill declined from 22% in 1967 to 16.8% in 1969.
It has been noted that Roman Catholics constitute a majority of the Rhode Island population. In the present study, about

church's magisterium. Foremost among these is the pill. Potvin, Westoff, and Ryder (1968), found that by 1965 no less than 53% of all Catholic women between 18 and 39 did not conform to Catholic teaching in their family limitation practice. This compares to 38% in 1960 and 30% in 1955 (Potvin, Westoff and Ryder, 1968). Many of these women were using the pill. Kass and Donaldson (1970), analyzing changes in Catholic contraceptive usage in Rhode Island before and after the issuance of Humanae Vitae concluded that 61% of those interviewed prior to the encyclical were "non-conformists" compared to 65% of those queried one year later.
Almost 13% of all Catholic wives in Rhode Island were using oral contraceptives in 1969 (Table 4). This proportion of current users has changed but very

slightly since 1967. As expected, nonCatholics were more likely to be using the pill. In 1967, twice as many of the latter were users as was the case among Catholics. However, the proportion of non-Catholic users has since declined, and by 1969 only 20.3% were users. Thus, the difference between the two groups was smaller in 1969 than in 1967; but this was due more to a decrease in use by nonCatholics than to an increase among Catholics.
The evidence on both educational attainment and religious affiliation suggests a certain tendency for non-Catholics and those with at least a high school education to be using oral contraceptives less in 1969 than they did earlier in the decade. A stable minority of Catholics and the less educated apparently remain convinced of the pill's redeeming features, as no significant changes in usage are observed for the three-year period. Convergence may be occurring slightly as educational attainment and religious affiliation are perhaps not as reliable indicators of oral contraceptive usage as they once were.
PANEL ANALYSIS
In the 1970 follow-up survey of all available respondents, the following question was asked: "Are you currently using the pill to keep from getting pregnant?" If the answer was "no," the respondent was asked: "Do you plan to use the pill in the future to keep from getting pregnant?" In addition, those respondents who had previously used the pill but had discontinued by 1970 were asked why they had done so and whether their decision had been influenced by the Senate hearings on the topic held the previous winter.
By matching information gathered in the 1970 survey with that derived from the original interviews in 1967-69, it is possible to classify women in terms of patterns

of oral contraceptive usage over time. The categories follow those developed by Ryder and Westoff in the 1965 national study. However, a few methodological differences make comparisons somewhat tenuous. First, two previous points in time are considered in this report--use at time of original interview and replies then to possible earlier use. Second, only women taking the pill to regulate fertility are considered users in the present report. Third, once married and fecund women to age SO are presently included as compared to all wives to age 45 in the 1965 study.
The two basic divisions are "Ever used" and "Never used." "Ever used," in turn, is further subdivided. (El) "Now using" includes all the women using the pill at the time of the 1970 follow-up survey. (E2) "May use again" includes those women not using oral contraceptives at the time of the 1970 survey, but who had used them at some time in the past and indicate they may possibly use them again in the future. (Past usage could be either at time of original interview or prior to that time.) (E3) "Will not use again" also encompasses those not using the pill in 1970 who have a record of past use, but who reply negatively to the question on possible future use. These three categories include all presently-married, fecund women under age 50 at the time of the 1970 survey who have ever used oral contraceptives. As noted in Table 5 they represent 32.3% of all the women in the study who were available for reinterview in 1970.
"Never used" is also divided into three categories. (Nl) "May use" includes those who have not used the pill in the past or present (1970), but who indicate plans to use in the future. As in the Ryder-Westoff study, those "Not sure" are also included as possible future users. These represent 4.1% of all the women. (N2) "Will not

use" encompasses women who have never used oral contraceptives and have no intention of using them in the future. These will be referred to occasionally as "Never users." This category contains 61.5% of all the women. (N3) The "Never heard of it" group consists of 12 women (2.1%). In all subsequent analyses, these will be combined with those in the N2 category.
Over 36% ol all the women in the 1970 follow-up sample have either used the pill or plan to do so in the future. On the other hand, 63.6% are literally "Never users" in the past, present, or future. Table 5 also shows that the proportion of past users (not currently using) who will not return to the pill (14.0%) is about as great as the per cent of current users; but only 7.8% are nonusers in 1970 who express any intention of using the pill in the future.
Younger women are more likely to have ever been users than older women. In fact, over 45% of those under 30 have used oral contraceptives at some time in their married lives. But even among these younger women, 19.1% will not resume use in the future, while 11.8% may turn to oral contraceptives later. Almost half of these youngest women are literally "Never

users." Women 40 and over are the least likely to have used the pill and their inclusion perhaps affects the results. Among women under 40, 38.9% are "Ever users," 17.5% do not plan to rely on oral contraception in the future, and 56.1% are "Never users."
A comparison with the 1965 national study indicates a greater percent of "Ever users" in the 1970 Rhode Island survey-- 32.3% of all women under 50 in the latter period and 25.9% of all women under 45 in 1965. However, a much greater proportion of Rhode Island "Ever users" will not utilize the pill in the future. A similar pattern is to be seen among the nonusers. For example, in 1965, 5.0% of the women were "Ever users" who will not use again, and 19.0% were women who had never used but might turn to the pill in the future. In 1970, the Rhode Island women in the same categories exhibited percentages of 14.0% and 4.1%,respectively. Even if limited to those under 40, the per cents were 17.5% and 5.0%--a reversal of the 1965 pattern. Thus, while more women have tried the pill by 1970, a much greater number are not using it at present and do not plan to do so in the future. Of course, the 1965 and 1970 findings are not exactly com-

parable. Also, the 1970panel data are based on original replies that might have been given as early as 1967.
It has been noted that the more educated women were less likely to be using the pill in 1969 than in 1967.The panel data yield additional insight (Table 6) on this chang-

traception was being accepted by all socioeconomic groups. There is some evidence of disenchantment by women with more education, but this is not apparent among those with less schooling. Diffusion can work two ways. While educated women may have heard of the pill earlier and may be more

ing use.Women with some college education are more likely to be current users, and more than half have used oral contraceptives at some time compared to about 30% of those with only a high school education and 27.8% of those with less schooling. However, about half of the "Ever users" who have had some college will not use them again in the future, while only onethird of the least educated "Ever users" have similar plans. The latter women are also more apt to resume their use (or begin using) in the future than those with a high school education or the college trained. It is noteworthy that in all education categories most of the women who have never used the pill have no intention of doing so in the future, and this is increasingly the case the more years of school completed.
Both the cross-sectional and the panel analyses suggest that by 1970 oral con-

innovative in their behavior, they are also more likely to have heard of its possible bad effects sooner through the mass media (Aldridge, 1968; Hellman, 1969). Their innovativeness may be leading some of them to discontinue the use of oral contraceptives and to search for more suitable techniques of family planning. To be sure, one in five women panel members with some college education is currently using the pill, but this may reflect the fact that the proportion of non-Catholics is much greater in that education category than in the others.
Despite some slight convergence between 1967 and 1969, there are some differences by religious affiliation of women. This is made quite clear in the panel analysis summarized in Table 7. Almost threequarters of the Catholic women interviewed in 1970 had not used oral contraceptives in

tween 1967 and 1969. The panel analysis indicates there are more "Ever users" who will not resume than there are current nonusers planning to resume or begin its usage. This does not negate the fact that many who discontinue are replaced by new, probably younger users. This section looks at the proportion of women who have discontinued using oral contraceptives and analyzes the possible effects of age, educational attainment, and religious affiliation in the discontinuation proportions. Additionally, the reasons given for stopping will be studied.
As Ryder and Westoff (1971, p. 155156) have stated, the extent of discontinuation and the reasons for doing so are important for two major reasons:

the past and 69.6% are literally "Never users." On the other hand, 54.0% of the non-Catholics have not used oral contraceptives and half are "Never users." However, half of the non-Catholic "Ever users" will not use them again compared to 40% of the Catholic "Ever users." The pattern of diffusion noted on educational attainment is not as obvious when looking at the effects of religious affiliation. There is a slight tendency for non-Catholics to be more dissatisfied with oral contraceptives, but many more have used them than have Catholics. It has also been noted that there has been a decrease in current usage among non-Catholics. Nevertheless, differences exist between the two groups. Presumably there is a strong interaction between the two independent variables (education and religion). Unfortunately, it is not possible to control for either while analyzing the effects of the other due to the small number of cases.

First, since the pill is the most effective contraceptive yet developed, there is a high demand for information about its acceptability from persons concerned with family planning programs . . . . Second, the pill is not just another contraceptive--it is a distinctive type of method. Ever since it was licensed for sale . . . in 1960 there has been much concern about possible consequences for the user's health.
In addition, the 1970 Senate hearings on
the side effects of oral contraceptives pos-
sibly may have contributed to the desire to
discontinue using the pill by some women.
This analysis focuses on the proportion
of the respondents in the 1967, 1968, and
1969 surveys who indicated they no longer
use oral contraceptives in 1970. About
30% of these women were originally inter-
viewed in 1967. Thus, the opportunity to
become a "former user" is increased in
this study as compared to the 1965 na-
tional survey. In the present study, it is
also possible to determine usage at three
points in time: prior to the original inter-
view; at the original interview; at the time

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DISCONTINUERS

differences between Catholics and nonCatholics are clearer.
REASONS FOR DISCONTINUATION
Of the 186 "Ever users" of oral contraceptives, 102 are not currently taking the pill. These were asked: "Why did you stop using it?" The responses were open-ended, but every effort was made to derive a specific reason for the change (Table 9). The

tinuing was side effects. These consisted mainly of pregnancy-like reactions such as nausea, gaining weight, and fluid retention. A number of women also indicated reasons related to the menstrual cycle: leg cramps, dizziness, excessive bleeding. Many also reported headaches and nervousness as their reason for no longer using oral contraceptives.
Second-category replies (problems other

responses were then coded into three categories as has been done by Frank and Tietze (1965, p. 122-127). First, discontinuation because of side effects; second, discontinuation due to other use problems; third, discontinuation for reasons not related to the pill. These categories were used in the 1965 national survey. In the Rhode Island study, 61.8% of those no longer taking the pill cited side effects as principal reasons for their decision, and 10.8% gave other reasons related to possible difficulties with the pill. Another 27.4% cited nonrelated factors. In the 1965 study, the respective proportions were 65%, 15%, and 20% (Ryder and Westoff, 1971, p. 157160).

of the pill. They did not experience actual physical side effects, but were likely to be upset by the negative possibilities sometimes attributed to oral contraceptives. Most of the 27.4% who discontinued for reasons unassociated with the pill did so in order to become pregnant. In fact, 17.6% of all discontinuers cited this as their main reason, which was a slightly higher proportion than the 15% noted in the 1965 survey.
Age, education, and religion were considered in analyzing the reasons given for discontinuation. It must be realized that these variables are themselves interrelated. Younger women and non-Catholics, on the average, are better educated. Thus the results must consider this interaction effect which cannot be controlled due to sample size.
Women under 30 were much more likely to give reasons not related to the pill than those over that age. This is, of course, due to the desire to become pregnant on the part of younger women. Similarly, a direct relation between education and the per cent citing such reasons is noted. This relationship may also partially reflect the different age structures. Non-Catholics are much more likely to give such reasons than are Catholics, and they are less likely to cite reasons associated with the pill. That is, Catholics are more apt to express a fear of the pill. Non-Catholics, on the other hand, in citing "to become pregnant" more often show a tendency to be more pragmatic in their use of the pill. It is also interesting to observe that no respondent gave religious reasons for discontinuing.
The relations between education and religion and the reasons for discontinuing partially explain the declining pattern of use by the better educated and the nonCatholics. To a certain extent, this relationship reflects a "planned pregnancy at-

titude" on the part of the better educated and the non-Catholics. These women have apparently been using the pill quite adequately as a method of family limitation. They may well return to it after the birth of a child. However, those with less education and the Catholics tend to stop using the pill for reasons associated with side effects. This may, of course, result in more "unplanned pregnancies."
Irrespective of their replies to "Why did you stop using it?", these same respondents were asked: "Was your decision influenced at all by the Senate hearings in Washington last winter?" That winter (1970) witnessed a great deal of publicity given to the hearings under Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin. The nightly news telecasts seldom failed to give this investigation wide coverage. Clinic records began showing that large numbers of women were abandoning the pill because of the unfavorable publicity resulting from the hearings. (Ross, 1970, p. 7). It was therefore suspected that even if a woman gave a pill-related answer to the question on discontinuation, this news may have contributed to the decision. One woman in eight (12.8%) indicated that the hearings affected their decision to quit (Table 10). The younger women and those with more education were somewhat more affected than the older and less educated. The relationship between religion and the replies was not significant, though non-Catholics were more affected than were Catholics. These findings, while not very significant, nevertheless support the earlier suggestion that the diffusion process has been at work on the better educated who are apparently more aware of the possible difficulties with oral contraception.
CONCLUSIONS
Between 1967 and 1969 there was a decline in the number of Rhode Island women using oral contraceptives and this was es-
