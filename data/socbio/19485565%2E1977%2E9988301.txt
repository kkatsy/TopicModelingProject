ABSTRACT: The historical trends of childlessness and of one-child, two-child, and three-or-morechild families among white and nonwhite women in the United States are studied in terms of period fertility tables. Given the age andparity of a woman, we can read from the fertility tables how her parity is expected to change at successive ages during the rest of her childbearing period, if she is subjected to the age-parity-specific fertility rates for a particular year. Thefertility tables for white and nonwhite women are constructed for the years 1940, 19S0, 1960, 1970, and 1974. These tables show that among white women whohave completed their childbearing (with period rates), the percentage with more than two children has decreased from 66 in 1960 to 27 in 1974, whereas the corresponding reduction among nonwhite women is from 67 to 48per cent (Table 1, Case 1).

In a recent paper, the author (197S) studied the historical trends of spinsterhood and childlessness among white and nonwhite women in the United States for the period 1940-70 on the basis of population census data. Since the proportion of never-married or childless women, as obtained directly from census tables, does not reflect the marriage or fertility pattern of the women in the census years but a cumulative picture of the patterns over a span of earlier years, synthetic cohorts based on two consecutive censuses were constructed to study the period rates for the decades 1940-50, 1950-60, and 1960-70.
The present paper is an extension of the earlier work, and attempts to study the historical trends not only of childlessness but also of the parity composition of women with children. Other major differences of the present study from the previous one are that (1) it uses both census and vital statistics data instead of only census

populations; (2) it obtains results for five different years, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1974, while the earlier study gave results for three decades, 1940-50, 1950-60, and 1960-70; and (3) it gives the fertility picture of total white and nonwhite women, whereas the first study pertained only to women married once and husband present.
The ultimate results of the present study are a set of fertility tables, each constructed from the age-parity-specific fertility rates for a particular year. These fertility tables tell us what is expected to happen to a cohort of 100 women of the same age and parity in regard to their parity composition at successive ages as they pass through the rest of their childbearing period, if they are subjected to the age-parity-specific fertility rates for a particular year and if each of them survives to the end of the childbearing period. For example, 100 women of age 20 and parity 1, when subjected to the fertil-

ity rates of white women of the United States for the year 1974, will have among them at age 35, 8 women with parity 1, 46 with parity 2, and 46 with parity 3+ (Table 6). All the fertility tables for white and nonwhite women are presented in Tables 2-7. A summary comparison of the fertility tables for the entire period 1940-74 is provided in Table 1.

The method of construction of a fertility

U.S. data for white women for 1960 as an

example.
Let us consider seven five-year age groups, 15-19, 20-24, . . . , 45^9, and label them as age groups 1, 2, . . . , 7. Let P(x,y) be the total number of women with

Q(x,0,2,+) = 1 - <?(x,0,0) -Q(x,0,l) -Q(x,0,2). (5)

= 1,2,3). The age-parity-specific fertility rate m(x,y) for women aged x with parity y is defined as

Proceeding as in (2) and (3), by analogy, we can write

m(x,y) = B(x,y

-1>, Q(x,l,2)

x = 1,2, . . . , 7; y = 0,1,2. (1)

For example, P(3,l), the number of

m{x,2) -

women aged 25-29 with parity 1 is

850,537, andB(3,2), the number of births of order 2 to women aged 25-29, is

Q(x,l,3+) = 1

248,124. Therefore, w(3,l), the age-

parity-specific fertility rate for women Q(x,2,2) =e-s

aged 25-29 with parity 1 is 0.292 = 1 - Q(x,2,2), Q(x,3+,3+) = 1. (8)

It may be noted that in the above formu-

for further breakdown of Q(x,y,3+) into Q(x,y,3), Q(x,y,4), . . . , the reader is referred to Das Gupta (1976).
To give numerical illustrations of the formulas in (2) through (8), let us consider the age group 25-29, with age-parityspecific fertility rates
m(3,0) = 0.132, m(3,l) = 0.292, m(3,2) = 0.189. (9)
Substituting these values in (9) into the formulas in (2) through (8), we obtain

everyone survived the five-year interval, y = 1,2,3+;
R(x,Nu\2) = the expected number of women Nu with parity y at the end of the age group x, given that at the beginning of the same age group their numbers by parities 2,3+ were n2, n3+ and that everyone survived the five-year interval, y = 2,3+.
It follows that
R(x,No\o) = n00(x,0,0),/?(*,#,|0)

0(3,0,0) = 0.52, 0(3,0,1) = 0.23, 0(3,0,2) = 0.18, 0(3,0,3+) = 0.07, (3(3,1,1) = 0.23, Q(3,l,2) = 0.44, 0(3,1,3+) = 0.33, 0(3,2,2) = 0.39,
0(3,2,3+) = 0.61, O(3,3+ ,3+) = 1. (10)
The numbers in (10) are amenable to clear-cut interpretations. The probability 0(3,1,2) = 0.44, for example, means that if a woman of exact age 25 having one child reproduces in her subsequent childbearing ages according to the ageparity-specific fertility rates of white women in the United States as of 1960, the probability that she will end up with 2 children at age 30 is 0.44, assuming that she will survive to this latter age. The other two possible situations for this particular woman are 1child and more than 2 children at age 30 with probabilities 0.23 and 0.33, respectively.
In order to construct the fertility tables, we denote:
R(x,Ny\0) = the expected number of women Ny with parity y at the end of the age group x, given that at the beginning of the same age group their numbers by parities 0,1,2,3+ were n0, n,, n2, n3+ and that everyone survived the five-year interval, y = 0,1,2,3+;
R(x,Ny\l) = the expected number of women Nu with parity y at the end of the age group x, given that at the beginning of the same age group their numbers by parities 1,2,3+ were n,, n2, n3+ and that

+ n20(x,2,3+) + «3+,
R(x,N2\2) = n2Q(x,2,2),R(x,N3+\2)
n3+. (11) Considering again the age group 25-29 and the corresponding O-values in (10), and assuming three different parity distributions of 100 women at age 25 given by (1) »0 = 37, M, = 25, n2 = 24, «3+ = 14, (2) n1 = 16, M2 = 40, M3+ = 44, and (3) n2 = 29, M3+ = 71, we obtain from (11) R(3,N010) = 19, R(3,N1\0) = 15,
R(3,N210) = 27, i?(3,iV3+|0) = 39,
R(3,Nt\l) =4,R(3,N2\l) = 23,

/?(3,2V3+|l) = 73, R(3,N212) = 11,
R(3,N3+\2) = 89. (12)
The physical interpretation of .R-values in (12) may be clear from an explanation of any one of them, say, R(3,N2\0) = 27. This formula means that if the parity distribution of 100 women of exact age 25 happens to be 37, 25, 24 and 14 respectively for parities 0, 1, 2, and 3+ , and if the fertility performance of these women (in terms of age-parity-specific fertility rates) in the next five years is the same as that of white women in the United States as of 1960, then, assuming that none of them will die before reaching age 30, the number of women with parity 2 at this latter age will be 27.
FERTILITY TABLES FOR U.S. DATA
A summary comparison of the fertility tables for 1940-70 is provided in Table 1. Fertility tables for white and nonwhite

women in the United States for the years 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1974 are presented in Tables 2-7. In computing the basic age-parity-specific fertility rates, the never-married (single) women were assumed to be of parity zero. Data classifying single women by parity are available only for 1970, and an additional set of fertility tables (Table 7) based on them is provided for this year.
The fertility tables for a particular race and year consist of 3 X 7 (= 21) blocks, each block starting with a cohort of size 100. The three segments across the table (Cases 1,2, and 3) are distinguished from one another by the initial common parity of all women in the cohort (0, 1, and 2, respectively). The seven segments from top to bottom provide seven different ages when a cohort (with a particular parity) starts childbearing according to the fertility rates for a particular year, and each is traced to the end of the childbearing period (assumed to be age 50).

Parity Distribution

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

The horizontal lines in a fertility table represent the numbers R(x,Nv\O), R(x,Ny\l), andR(x,Nv\2) with respect to the w-values in the preceding lines. As a special case of R-values, the second horizontal line in each block of a fertility table (divided by 100) gives the probabilities Q(x,y,z). The age-parity-specific fertility rates m(x,y) assumed in our computations are not provided, but one may derive these rates from the fertility tables by using the relationships in (2), (6), and (8), that is,
m(x,y) = -logQ(x,y,y)/5,
= 0,1,2. (13)
The sources of population and birth data for the calculation of m(x,y) are indicated in the footnotes of the fertility tables.
When a cohort of 100 women have the same age and parity and these are known, we can read from the fertility tables how the parity distribution of these women will change at successive ages as they pass through their remaining childbearing years producing children at the ageparity-specific fertility rates for a particular year, assuming that none of them will die before the end of the childbearing period. Each number in a fertility table has its own interpretation. For white women in 1960, for example, the number corresponding to age 45 and parity 3+ in Case 2 (with initial cohort age equal to 25) is 60 (Table 4). This figure means that if 100 women of age 25 and parity 1reproduce in their subsequent childbearing years according to the age-parity-specific fertility rates for U.S. white women as of 1960, and if none of them dies, then, when they reach age 45, the number of women among them with parity 3+ is expected to be 60.
Of particular interest in a fertility table are the numbers corresponding to the last horizontal line in each block, which represent the ultimate parity distribution at the

end of the childbearing period, given the initial (identical) age and parity of the cohort of 100 women. These last lines for the diagonally located three blocks from the fertility tables for a particular race and year along with the completed cohort parity distributions of women aged 45-49 in the censuses are shown in Table 1.
RESULTS
From the fertility tables (Tables 2-7) and, in particular, from the selective numbers given in Table 1, we may list some salient findings as follows:
1. Given the parity of a woman, the tendency on her part to keep it unchanged (for voluntary and involuntary reasons) increases with the decrease in the length of the remaining childbearing years. This is true not only when we follow her to the end of the childbearing period (which is obvious on theoretical ground that the probability of a birth in a period of time cannot be less than the probability of a birth in a section of that period), but also true in general when we consider a given length of time in the future. For white women, 1974, for example, starting at age 20, childlessness reduces to 29 per cent (Case 1) and one-childness reduces to 8 per cent (Case 2) in 15 years. But, these percentages corresponding to age 25, for the same length of time, are respectively 42 and 19 (Table 6). For nonwhite women, 1974, under identical situations, childlessness and one-childness reduce to 35 and 7 per cent corresponding to age 20 and to 51 and 20 per cent, respectively, corresponding to age 25 (Table 6). Although marriage is not explicitly incorporated into the model, we may draw an indirect conclusion that the higher age at marriage is associated with a greater risk of childlessness, even for the same period of exposure. This finding is in agreement with the re-

Parity Distribution

fertility tables that both white and nonwhite women have drastically changed their parity distribution in the course of the last quarter of a century in favor of more childless, one-child, and two-child families, the changes for white women

having been more spectacular than those for nonwhite women. It should be emphasized that the above findings are only a few of many such observations that one can make from the set of fertility tables presented in this paper.
