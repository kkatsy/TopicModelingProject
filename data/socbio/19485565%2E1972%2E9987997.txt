Nilgiris, or Nilagiris, which means "Blue Mountains," is the smallest district of the state of Madras in India, covering an area of 984 square miles. This district is mainly populated by some Hindu castes and four tribes, namely the Badaga, the Toda, the Kurumba, and the Kota. An ethno-biological survey of the Kota was begun in 1966 and has continued until the present. Some of the results obtained in the course of this study have already been published (Ghosh, 1970; Basu and Ghosh, 1968). In this communication, the data on inbreeding are given. A detailed report of this study will be presented in a subsequent paper.
Among the four major tribes of this district, the Kota belong to the lowest social stratum (Francis, 1908). It seems that the Kota comprise a biologically isolated community, and this biological isolation has been caused in good part by their social relations with other Nilgiri tribes.
The Kota are a small population with a total of 1,203 individuals divided among seven villages, namely Aggal, Kil-Kotagiri, Trichigadi, Kollimalai, Kundah, Sholur, and Gudalur. Each village is divided at least into three exogamous keris. No one is allowed to take his or her mate from the village keri to which he or she belongs; but one is

allowed to marry someone from the same keri of another village.
The purpose of the present communication is to ascertain the frequencies of various types of consanguineous matings and thereby the inbreeding coefficients and its effect on the fertility of the population. The data on consanguineous matings among the Kota have been collected from the entire population.
In Table 1 the frequencies of the different types of consanguineous matings are given. Out of total number of 449 marriages (unpublished demographic data of the author) 57 or 12.69% were consanguineous. Of these 57 marriages, 43.86% were with full first cousins, and 19.30% were with full second cousins.
Out of 57 consanguineous marriages, 17 or 29.82% were childless matings, but all the wives had not yet finished their reproductive span. It is, therefore, a rough estimate of sterility among the inbred couples.
The inbreeding coefficients have been calculated directly from the pedigrees by the path-coefficient method. In calculating inbreeding coefficients, only the closest relationship between spouses has been taken into consideration with a view to simplify-

ing the mathematical calculations. This method, first proposed by Wright (1922), has also been followed by Salzano (1961), Bonne (1963), and others, whereas Spuhler and Kluckhohn (1953), Sutter and Tabah (1956), and others have considered all the possible relationships between the spouses to ascertain inbreeding coefficients. The inbreeding coefficients vary between 0.0010 and 0.1250 for the Kota, the average being 0.04207.
DISCUSSION
The frequency of consanguineous marriages among the Kota is 12.69%, which is fairly high, like the 14% frequency found among the Caingang Indians (Salzano, 1961) and the Samaritans (Bonne, 1963). The frequency of such marriages is not as high among the whites of Lorient and Gustavia parishes of the St. Barthélémy Islands (Benoist, 1964). In comparison also with the white populations (inbreeding frequency, 2.4%) of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Freire-Maia, 1957), the frequency of inbreeding among the Kota is quite high.
Marriage between consanguineous rela-

tives is highly favored by the various religious isolates of Andhra Pradesh (Dronamraju, 1967; Dronamraju and Meera Khan, 1963; Sanghvi, 1966). The practice of inbreeding among the different religious groups in Bombay has also been reported by Sanghvi, Verde, and Master (1956). A few cases of inbreeding have also been reported among the Kayastha (a Hindu caste) of Bengal and the Baiga (a tribal population) of Madhya Pradesh (Sarkar, 1967). Compared with the various populations of Southern India, the frequency of cousin marriage among the Kota is not very high.
Aberle et al. (1963) and Ember (1962) assume that societies which practice inbreeding may be selected out, if the death rate due to inbreeding is high. Livingstone (1964) writes that consanguineous marriages within a single society have a higher death rate among their offspring. It has been found among the Kota that the average number of surviving offspring per married woman (1.95) in consanguineous marriages is slightly lower than that found in the total population (2.03) (unpublished demographic data). The present findings

apparently agree with Livingstone's assumption, but more data are required to assess the effect of inbreeding on the fertility of a population.
The coefficient of inbreeding (0.04207) among the Kota is almost equal to the highest recorded inbreeding coefficient (0.043448) of the Samaritans (Bonne, 1963). I t may well be assumed that this inbreeding coefficient should still be regarded only the minimum for the same reasons as pointed out for the Samaritan population by Bonne (1963). Ishikuni et al. (1960) have reported that the inbreeding coefficient for Hosojima Island is 0.03341. Compared to the Kota population, the inbreeding coefficients of the other populations in India, which show higher frequencies of consanguineous marriages, are considerably lower (Dronamraju and Khan, 1963).

It is generally assumed that the smaller the population size, the higher is the frequency of consanguineous marriages. The population size of any Hindu caste in Andhra Pradesh is several times bigger than that of the Kota and the rate of consanguineous marriages in any Hindu caste is much higher than that in the Kota population. As such, it is not the size of the population which is responsible for higher frequency of consanguineous marriages, but cultural and social factors are also involved as pointed out by Salzano (1962).
