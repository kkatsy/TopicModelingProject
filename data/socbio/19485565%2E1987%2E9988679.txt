Seasonality of Birth: Two Findings from the Decennial Census
Bert Kestenbaum
Office of the Actuary Social Security Administration Baltimore, Maryland
ABSTRACT:Two results on the seasonality of birth phenomenon are derived from tabulations of 1980 census data: first, that the familiar pattern of spring trough and summer peak prevailed in the decades before the establishment of a national birth registration data system; second, that the seasonal pattern is most pronounced for the lower socioeconomic group.
Live births in the United States have U.S. births in the late 1800's and early for some time followed a pattern of 1900's exhibited a spring peak, as is spring trough and summer peak--at found commonly among European least since the initiation of the national countries.

year and quarter ofbirth. First, to adjust them to the levels which would have been attained were the four calendar quarters equal parts of the year, with due recognition of the need for different adjustments for leap years and other years.
The second adjustment is for length of survival. In any cohort, those born earlier in the year must survive longer than those born later inthe year to reach April 1, 1980. Accordingly, survival probabilities for 3, 6, and9 months specific toage, sex, and race were applied to persons born in the second, third, and fourth quarters ofthe year, respectively. These probabilities were derived from the U.S. Decennial Life Tables for 1979-81 (National Center for Health Statistics, 1985).
RESULTS
SEASONALITY BEFORE THE 1930'S
From 1980 census population counts for the native-born by year and quarter of birth, adjusted as described above, it is clear that births were fewer than average in spring and more than average in summer in thefour decades prior to the

1930's. The sample of baptism and gravestone records in two states which exhibited a spring peak, cited earlier, was either a too-small or an unrepresentative sample.
The census data are summarized in the left-hand panel of Table 1.Birthcohorts arecombined into 10-year groups, and the statistic presented in each table cell istheratio of births during a 10-year period occurring in the given calendar quarter to one-quarter of all births occurring during the period. Sample sizes are also shown.
One can also learn from the table that births in the fourth quarter were more numerous than births in thefirst quarter during the decades after 1940, whilebefore then the opposite wastrue. Unfortunately, we cannot explain this reversal.
The right-hand panel of Table 1 is based on counts of births since 1933 given in publications of the National Center for Health Statistics (National Center for Health Statistics, 1977;National Center for Health Statistics, 1966). The agreement is gratifyingly close, supporting this study's premise that adjusted census population counts

may be used to investigate certain natality phenomena.
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS
For an investigation of socioeconomic differentials in seasonal birthpatterns based on census records, the births to be studied must be fairly recent, soas to minimize the chance that the socioeconomic status of the parents has changed between the birth and thecensus date; yet they must also be extensive enough to support statistically valid inferences. Accordingly, this aspect ofthe study is based on births between 1977 and 1979,and the results reported have been successfully tested for significance.
Socioeconomic information available in the public-use file includes educational attainment and a code which classifies the family's income position relative to the poverty level appropriate to the family's composition. Weused each of these to partition the sample into three categories. With respect to family income in 1979 the groupings are: below

the poverty level, above the poverty level but below twice the poverty level,
and above twice the poverty level. The three categories for the schooling of the head of household are: did not finish high school,finishedhigh school but did not begin college, andhadsome college. The measures of socioeconomic status used inthelocal studies cited earlierare: educational attainment of mother, average property value in the census tract of residence, and whether the hospital service was general service or private service.
We find, both for the income andthe education measure, that while the pattern of spring trough and summer peak is common to all socioeconomic classes, differentials in the amplitude of the pattern do exist, with seasonality greatest for the lowest class. The magnitude of the difference between the lowest and highest socioeconomic classes is comparable to the magnitudes of Black-White and South-Other differences. These results are shown in Table 2, where,
