Between 1896 and 1988 the Havasupai Indians produced 677 births. The sex ratio among those births was 0.51 male. While there were secular variations in the sex ratio at birth and, consequently, in adult sex ratios, the secondary sex ratio correlated negatively with birth order in a marital union throughout the period (Martin, 1994). Hence, secondary sex ratios remained high among early births when the secondary sex ratio as a whole was declining as they did when adult sex ratios were high. Conversely, sex ratios among later births remained low when the overall secondary sex ratio was high and adult sex ratios were low. In sum, the negative correlation between the secondary sex ratio and birth order in a marital union was not a function of either a secular decline in the sex ratio at birth nor of parents producing lower sex ratios at birth when adult sex ratios were high and higher sex ratios at birth when adult sex ratios were low (James, 1997).
My interpretation of these data is that the sex ratio at birth declined because the coital rate declined as couples had more surviving children (Martin, 1994). Higher coital rates produce higher secondary sex ratios because more frequent coitus increases impedence in the cervical mucus and increased impedence selects for the more motile, Y spermatozoa (Martin,

1995, 1997). James (1994, 1997) states that while coital rates may have some slight effect on the sex ratio at birth, it is not sufficient to account for the sex ratio variations in the Havasupai and similar data. In support of this assertion he cites data from the United Kingdom in which the mean coital rate declines by half between ages 20 and 40 while the sex ratio at birth declines hardly at all, from 0.52 to 0.51 male. The problem with these national data is that they do not isolate the relevant variable, which is the frequency of unprotected coitus in the fertile period.
In heterogenous national populations some women on average may engage in coitus one day in three but avoid it altogether in the week or so before the anticipated time of ovulation. When ovulation occurs early among such females, they may continue their sexual activity into the early portion of their fertile period, and they may conceive. When they do, the sex ratio among their conceptions will reflect the endogenous mucus viscosity at the time of insemination and a coital rate of one day in three. However, if other women who on average engage in coitus one day in three and seek to avoid conception by abstaining for the week before ovulation ovulate late, they may reinitiate coitus at the very end of the follicular phase just before ovulation. If

there are conceptions, the sex ratio among those conceptions will reflect endogenous mucus penetrability at the time of insemination and a coital rate in which coitus occurred but once in the week or so before ovulation. In both cases, however, the mean coital rate is one day in three. Grouping data from such couples, because their overall or mean coital rate are equivalent simply obscures any relations between coital rates and the sex of the offspring.
Specification of the effect of coital rate on the sex ratio is difficult because of the confounding effects of endogenous mucus penetrability (Martin, 1995, 1997). However, comparison of data in which coitus seems to have occurred on the day before or on ovulation day after a period of abstinence (Guerrero, 1974; Perez et al., 1982; France et al., 1984; Martin, 1995, 1997) with data where there were multiple coital acts prior to those days (Harlap, 1979; Weinberg et al., 1995) suggests that more frequent coitus may raise the proportion of male births by about 14 per cent (Martin, 1997).
The idea that coital rates may affect the sex of offspring is also consistent with the data from polygynous societies. If a woman's interest in coitus declines as the number of her children and her workload increases, her husband is likely to be less insistent if he has other younger wives with fewer children. We should therefore expect coital rates among polygynously married women to be lower than among monogamous women and for those rates to decline as the number of their children and their own ages increase. If higher coital rates raise the probability of a male birth, we should expect sex ratios among births to polygynous women to be lower than among

those to monogamous women. We should also expect those sex ratios to decline with birth order, maternal age, and with the number of younger co-wives. We might expect this pattern to be especially marked when more senior wives set up independent households and gain greater control over their sexuality.
There are data consistent with these expectations. Whiting (1993) found in seven East African groups that polygynously married women in the first ten years of their marriages produced significantly lower sex ratios than did monogamous women. Among, the Yanomamo (Chagnon et al., 1979) the wives of the more polygynous leading men produced lower sex ratios than did the wives of lesser monogamous males and sex ratios declined with birth order. BorgerhoffMulder (1994) reports lower sex ratios among births to polygynous wives with younger co-wives and to residentially removed wives. Both Whiting (1993) and Borgerhoff-Mulder (1994) suggest that the lower sex ratios reflect lower coital rates and/or greater control over the time of insemination.
James (1997) does not really dispute these data. Instead, he cites data from two studies which he argues indicate that the co-residence among co-wives alters their hormonal levels and raises sex ratios among their births. The Mormon data of Mealey and Mackey (1990), however, do not systematically address the issue of polygyny, residence, and sex ratios, being concerned with rank and sex ratio; but they do show that second wives living polygynously (together) produce lower sex ratios than do second wives living monogamously with their previously widowed or divorced husbands. These data are not consistent with James's hypothesis.

James (1994,1997) also cites Thomas's (1969) data which were gathered in 1913 in West Africa. Thomas spent three months on an ethnographic survey of three villages of Ibo-speaking people with a total population of 6,079. Working through an interpreter, he also collected information on births by interviewing men. Respondents were asked to recall all the births to all their wives, both living and dead. In one village, 30 men reported 232 wives living and dead (M = 7.7) and purportedly recalled all the births to those wives.
James points out that the sex ratios among the remembered births increase with the number of a man's wives. He takes this finding as support of his contention that co-residence raises the sex ratio among births to co-residing wives. However, combining data from Thomas's tables on pages 18 and 19 (Thomas, 1969) indicates that after two wives the number of remembered births per wife declines as the number of wives increases. Previously (Martin, 1994), I have argued that Thomas's male respondents had faulty memories and that they forgot more female than male births and deaths, and their errors increased with the number of their wives. As James (1997) does not find any objections compelling and as, in the absence of more data, our disagreement on this matter cannot be resolved, let us credit Thomas's data for the moment and draw out their implications for the issues at hand.
First, it should be emphasized that these data are not equivalent to those of Whiting (1993) and Borgerhoff-Mulder (1994). Those data all refer to women in the first ten years of their marriages. Thomas's data refer to living women of all ages and to deceased women. Because of this fact, we do not know in the

Thomas data how many of the wives with one co-wife were actually alive and living with a co-wife when they had their children. Neither do we know how frequently wives died while young and thereby contributed to their husbands' acquisition of other wives. Moreover, if young adult female mortality was high, it could be that the decline in the number of births per wife as the number of wives increased was a function of the more "polygynous" males having higher proportions of wives who had died early and who consequently produced fewer births.
If this were the case, we should not be surprised that the sex ratio among births increased with the number of cowives. Thomas (1969, p. 24) also reports that in 120 genealogies 0.63 of first births were male. Since the sex ratio among all births was 0.52 male, the higher per cent of male first births indicates that sex ratios declined with birth order. If the sex ratio declines with birth order, women who produce fewer births because they die while relatively young will produce higher sex ratios. In short, the increase in the sex ratios and the decline in the number of births per wife may reflect high female mortality and a negative correlation between birth order and sex ratios.
More importantly, Thomas's (1969, p. 24) data on first births indicate that the sex ratio among first births to first wives, women who would not be living with co-wives when they conceived, was not significantly different than the sex ratio among first births to subsequent wives and was much higher than the sex ratio among later births, births which would have resulted from conceptions to women who were in co-residence. In short, the Thomas data, if they are credited, contradict James's hypothesis that co-residence

of wives causes hormonal changes which raises sex ratios among their offspring.
James's proposition that co-residence among females produces higher sex ratios was stimulated by the work of Perret (1990). Perret originally (1986, 1990) reported that female mouse lemurs which were caged with other females (and males) produced higher sex ratios than did females which were kept isolated then put into heterosexual groups at estrus. Subsequent work (Perret, 1996) revealed that what triggered the sex ratio variation was not so much co-residence as it was the duration of a female's exposure in the luteal phase to the smell of the urine of other females. Such exposure seemed to induce stress as it raised cortisol levels in those females. It also was associated with reduced litter sizes, more abortions, fewer impregnations, and higher sex ratios among births (Perret, 1996). In an earlier work (1986) Perret also reports that the ovaries of the females exposed to other females in the pre-follicular (luteal) phase contained many atretic follicles and high cortisol levels while estrogen was low.

follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). The consequence is reduced follicular development. Because the developing primary follicle produces the estrogen, estradiol (E2), and because it is the increase in E2 which accounts for the improvements in mucus penetrability over the later follicular phase, stress in the luteal phase may reduce mucus penetrability in the follicular phase. Since less penetrable mucus seems to raise Y selection (Martin, 1995, 1997), stress in the luteal phase should raise the sex ratio among any conceptions. Because a less developed follicle may also result in follicular atresis, and anovulation, stress in the luteal phase can also reduce the probability of conception. Further, because a well developed follicle is necessary if the luteinized follicle or corpus luteum is to produce enough progesterone to sustain a subsequent luteal phase capable of maintaining a conception, stress in the previous luteal phase may also increase the probability of early (largely male) spontaneous abortions (Rivier and Rivest, 1991; Sherman and Korenman, 1974).

Mouse lemurs differ from humans in many ways. For instance, their vaginas are imperforate until just before ovulation and mating in a cycle takes place in a matter of hours. The timing of intercourse and coital rates would not appear to be relevant variables in the determination of this sex ratio variation. However, there are elements in Perret's reports which appear to parallel what we might expect in humans.
In humans, chronic stress suppresses the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) (Rivier and Rivest, 1991). If the stress occurs in the luteal phase, as against the follicular phase, the significant effect will be a reduction in

Conversely, if chronic stress occurs in the follicular but not luteal phase, the LH surge may be postponed if it is not inhibited altogether while follicular development, the production of E2, and improvements in mucus penetrability all continue. Hence, stress in the follicular phase may prolong the phase and lower the sex ratio among any conceptions (Weinberg et al., 1995; Martin, 1997) by improving cervical mucus. The lemurs which were kept separate until estrus, if they experienced any stress at all, would not have experienced it until when they were placed with other females in the late follicular phase.
These expectations are all consistent with Perret's findings and suggest that

stress-induced reductions in FSH in the luteal phase may reduce E2 in the subsequent follicular phase which raises the sex ratio by increasing Y selection by the cervical mucus. These relationships are not consistent with James's (1971, 1986, 1994) material model in which more, not less, estrogen raises the probability of a male conception. In that model, the sex of offspring is affected by the female's hormone levels at the time of conception. Early in the follicular phase, testosterone, estrogen, the gonadotropins, FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) are at low concentrations. As the follicle develops, its production of E2 increases geometrically. This increase suppresses the production of the gonadotropins until a level is reached at which the negative feedback is reversed and there is a surge in FSH and especially LH (Speroff et al., 1989; Shoham et al., 1995; Martin, 1997). The LH surge is quickly followed by ovulation. Hence, James argues that when conception (1971, 1986) occurs early in this period, the low levels of FSH and LH allow the effects of estrogen and testosterone to prevail and the probability that the conception will be a male is raised. However, as the gonadotropins increase, they overcome those effects and conceptions which occur closer to the time of ovulation are more likely to be females.
This model, of course, ignores the fact that conception cannot occur before ovu-

lation. In other formulations of the model, James substitutes time of fruitful insemination for conception--a significant shift because a fruitful insemination may occur days before ovulation. The hormone concentrations at the time of insemination will be quite different than they are when ovulation occurs. Indeed, when a fruitful insemination occurs early in the fertile period, the inseminated spermatozoa will encounter a female reproductive tract low in all these hormones. However, as they await the release of the ovum, they will be subject to increasing concentrations of all these hormones including the highest concentrations of the gonadotropins. If it is exposure to gonadotropins that enhances the probability of female conceptions, we should expect either no difference in sex ratios by day of insemination or for the sex ratio to be lower among conceptions due to earlier inseminations.
In summary, James's specific ideas about hormonal control of sex ratios do not seem plausible and his criticisms of my ideas lack force. He is correct, however, in noting that my ideas (Martin, 1995, 1997) say nothing about paternal factors, and I certainly have given little thought to why the distribution of combinations of sexes in litters are subbinomial in some species.
