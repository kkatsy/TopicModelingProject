ABSTRACT: Bourgeois-Pichat's biometric model was developed as a method to decompose infant mortality into endogenous and exogenous components. The model assumes that no endogenous deaths occur after the first month of life. This paper uses data for the United States to examine the hypothesis that recent advances in medicine extend endogenous mortality past the first month of life. The biometric model is found consistently to underestimate the endogenous infant mortality rate and to overestimate the exogenous infant mortality rate relative to cause of death analysis. Direct examination of the age distribution of infant mortality shows that the proportion of all infant mortality that occurs in the first month of life declined from 75.37 per cent in 1970 to 65.40 per cent in 1985, and that a significant and increasing proportion of the mortality occurring after the first month of life is due to endogenous causes. The development of new empirical models is suggested.

A distinction traditionally made in the literature on infant mortality is between endogenous and exogenous infant mortality (Logan, 1953; Bouvier and van der Tak, 1976). Endogenous infant mortality is defined as all deaths at ages under one year attributable to factors preceding or associated with birth (congenital anomalies, short gestation, low birth weight, birth trauma, and certain other conditions originating in the perinatal period). Exogenous infant mortality is defined as all deaths under age one year attributable to factors in the postnatal environment (infectious diseases, poor nutrition, poisonings, and accidents) (Shryock and Siegel, 1976, p. 418). While some question the utility of continuing to distinguish endogenous from exogenous infant mortality on the grounds that many determinants of infant survival are mediated through the social, be-

havioral, and environmental characteristics of the mother (Eberstein and Parker, 1984, p. 310; Geronimus, 1986), the rationale for continuing to make and refine this distinction is that endogenous and exogenous mortality predominantly result from distinct sets of causes, follow different trends over time, and respond to different kinds of preventive and ameliorative interventions.
The biométrie model (BourgeoisPichat, 1946, 1950, 1951a, and 1951b)1 was developed as a method for decomposing infant mortality into endogenous and exogenous components, primarily for studies of historical pop-

ulations where infectious diseases predominated and for studies of infant mortality in populations where reliable data on cause of death are not available. If reliable data are available, it is possible to compute endogenous and exogenous infant mortality rates directly by defining subsets of endogenous and exogenous causes of death (cause of death analysis).2 The biométrie model has been used in numerous studies to adjust historical baptism registers for under-enumeration resulting from mortality prior to baptism (Wrigley, 1977; Wrigley and Schofield, 1981, pp. 97-102), to examine the plausibility of historical European data on infant deaths obtained from local parish registers (Houdaille, 1980), and to estimate indirectly the endogenous and exogenous infant mortality rates of populations for which reliable causeof-death data are unavailable (Biraben and Henry, 1957; Cantrelle and Leridon, 1971; Abdou Issa, 1972; Vallin, 1975; Cantrelle, 1980; Bley and Baudot, 1986; Baudot, 1989).
The biométrie model is based on three central assumptions: (1) the age structure of deaths between 1 and 11 months of age remains constant across time and location and is independent of the prevailing level of mortality; (2) no endogenous deaths occur after the first month of life; and (3) the exoge-

nous deaths in the first month of life follow the same pattern as those at ages 1 to 11 months. If these assumptions obtain, the biométrie model provides a method for decomposing the total infant mortality rate into three additive components: the endogenous rate, the exogenous rate under age 1 month, and the exogenous rate from 1 to 11 months of age.
Over the past century, infectious diseases and other exogenous causes of mortality have been reduced in the United States and other developed countries through the combined effects of improvements in public works and advances in medical knowledge and technologies.3 In addition, advances in medicine which impact on the survival chances of infants with conditions of endogenous origin have proceeded at a remarkable pace (Hack et al., 1979; Miller, 1985). Since Bourgeois-Pichat first articulated the biométrie model, progress in neonatal intensive care and numerous other medico-technological innovations have sustained the lives of many infants who otherwise would not have survived, particularly premature and low birth weight infants (Knobloch et al., 1982; Gortmaker et al., 1985; McCormick, 1987). However, these medical advances may have resulted in the short-term prolongation of life for some infants such that they are

2The infant mortality rate is conventionally expressed as the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births. Although this is in fact a ratio which approximates the probability of death among infants in a given year rather than a demographic rate in the strict sense of the term, I will follow this convention in the analyses which follow. For example, the endogenous infant mortality rate is calculated as the number of deaths under one year of age due to endogenous causes divided by the total number of live births, multiplied by 1,000. For a more detailed discussion of these issues, see Shryock and Siegel, 1976, p. 410-418.

3There is considerable debate in the demographic literature related to the relative influence of medical versus nonmedical interventions on the overall decline of mortality in both more and less developed countries (for example, see Preston, 1980; Preston, 1985). For the purposes of this paper, I will leave this debate aside. I assume that medical and nonmedical interventions have had some impact on the decline of both endogenous and exogenous infant mortality, but that the principal factors which have impacted on endogenous infant mortality are the result of advances in medicine.

sustained through their first month but die later during their first year (National Center for Health Statistics, 1966; Kulkarni et al., 1978; Hack et al., 1980; Zdeb, 1982; Lantoine and Pressât, 1984; Stockwell et al., 1987).4 As Poston and Rogers stated (1986, p. 328): "We are still inclined to maintain that medical technology, emphasizing curative health care, has comparatively little control over many deaths arising from endogenous causes. New technology has saved very-low birth weight neonates, sometimes through heroic measures, but we wonder whether infant deaths are averted or merely prolonged."
This paper examines the hypothesis that the assumptions underlying the biometric model are no longer valid for the United States because advances in medicine have resulted in the extension of endogenous mortality past the first month of life. I begin with an indepth examination of the biométrie model using data for the United States for selected years from 1935 to 1985.1 then compare the estimated endogenous and exogenous infant mortality rates derived from the biométrie model and cause-of-death analysis respectively for 1970,1975,1980, and 1985. If advances in medical technology have resulted in the short-term prolongation of life for some infants so that an increasing proportion of deaths from 1 to
4Many of the studies cited in this section are primarily concerned with the congruence between neonatal mortality and endogenous mortality rates and postneonatal mortality and exogenous mortality rates, respectively. There is growing agreement in the literature that the neonatal mortality rate is not an appropriate proxy for the endogenous mortality rate because a considerable proportion of endogenous mortality occurs at ages above 28 days. Additionally, a proportion of the mortality that occurs in the neonatal period is due to exogenous causes.

11 months of age are due to endogenous causes, then the biométrie model should underestimate the endogenous infant mortality rate and overestimate the total exogenous infant mortality rate (the sum of the exogenous infant mortality rate under age 1 month and the exogenous infant mortality rate from 1 to 11 months of age) relative to the same rates obtained from cause of death analysis. Finally, I will directly examine the age distribution of endogenous deaths in the first year of life for the United States in 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985 to determine whether a significant proportion of the mortality occurring after the first month of life is due to endogenous causes.
THE BIOMETRIC MODEL
The biométrie model posits an invariant linear relationship between the cumulative infant mortality rates from ages 1 to 11 months and age, once age is transformed by the function [log(n-t-l)3], where n is age in days since birth. Once age has been linearized, the endogenous and exogenous infant mortality rates can be estimated as shown in Figure I.5
Figure 1 illustrates the application of the biométrie model to data for the United States in 1935. The estimated endogenous infant mortality rate is found by extrapolating to age zero the straight line formed by the cumulative mortality rates from 1 to 11 months of age (see dotted line AC). The
5The denominator for the calculation of all rates between 1935 and 1955 is the adjusted number of live births. The estimates presented in this section were calculated using the ordinary least squares regression model for 1935. See further discussion of the use of regression to correct for nonlinearity later in this text.

Y-intercept is the estimated endogenous infant mortality rate under age 1 month (A on the graph). The estimated exogenous infant mortality rate under age 1 month (segment AB) is obtained by subtracting the endogenous infant mortality rate from the cumulative infant mortality rate under age 1 month (C on the graph). The exogenous infant mortality rate from 1 to 11 months of age (segment BD) is obtained by subtracting the cumulative infant mortality rate under age 1 month from the total infant mortality rate (D on the graph). Thus, the total infant mortality rate is 50.97 per 1,000 live births; the endogenous rate is 24.54 per 1,000 live births; the total exogenous rate is 26.42 per 1,000 live births; the exogenous rate under age 1 month is 5.54 per 1,000 live births; and the exogenous rate from 1to 11 months is 20.88 per 1,000 live births.
DEVIATIONS FROM THE EXPECTED
LINEAR PATTERN
Although the biométrie model has been generally accepted and widely utilized, there are a number of cases cited in the literature where the expected linear relationship has not been found. For example, Bourgeois-Pichat (1952o) describes the case of Sardinia from 1948 to 1950. In this case cumulative mortality was found to rise more rapidly after the fourth month of life than was expected on the basis of mortality from ages 1 to 3 months. The more rapid rise in mortality after the fourth month was attributed to deaths from digestive impairments associated with the cessation of breastfeeding and the beginning of dietary supplementation. Other studies have reported this pattern of increased mortality in the

latter half of the first year of life associated with prolonged breastfeeding (Biraben and Henry, 1957; Cantrelle and Leridon, 1971, p. 512).
Knodel and Kintner (1977) used the biométrie model to analyze the effect of differences in breastfeeding practices on infant mortality. Consistent deviations from the expected linear relationship were found for populations where breastfeeding was common and for populations where breastfeeding was uncommon. In populations where breastfeeding was common and long in duration, mortality was found to rise more rapidly in the later months of the first year of life than expected on the basis of mortality in the earlier months. In populations where breastfeeding was uncommon or very short in duration, the reverse pattern was found; mortality increased more rapidly in the first few months of life than in the latter half of the first year of life. The authors note that deviations from the expected linear relationship are problematic because the estimated endogenous mortality is greatly affected by which data points within the first year of life are chosen as the basis for the estimation. The authors discuss their results in terms of their implications for the application of the biométrie model in studies of historical demography where the model is sometimes used to test the plausibility of data on infant deaths extracted from parish registers, and in studies of less developed countries where trends toward declining or shortened breastfeeding have been observed.
A different nonlinear pattern of biometric model results was found for Quebec from 1944 to 1947 (BourgeoisPichat, 1951a, 1952a). In this case, cu-

mulative mortality after 6 months of age was found to rise more slowly than expected on the basis of the mortality from 1 to 6 months of age. This more rapid rise in mortality was attributed in part to medical advances which prolonged the lives of some infants such that endogenous deaths occurred after the first month of life, and, in part, to certain sanitary and medical techniques that can only be applied after the infant has reached a certain age.6 Although Bourgeois-Pichat himself recognized that "medical treatment, in extending the life of malformed or feeble children, has increased theproportion of endogenous deaths after the first month" (Bourgeois-Pichat, [1951a] 1981, p. 13), there has been only one recent study of the impact of the extension of endogenous deaths past 1 month of age on the biométrie analysis of infant mortality (Lantoine and Pressât, 1984).
BIOMETRIC MODEL RESULTS FOR THE
UNITED STATES, 1935-1985,
SELECTED YEARS
The results obtained from the biometric model summarize the decline of infant mortality in the United States. Figure 2 shows the application of the biometric model to data for the United States for selected years from 1935to 1985. Leaving aside for the moment the deviations from linearity which caution that the biometric model may not be operating as intended, Figure 2 summarizes the magnitude of the overall decline of infant mortality (the

change in the highest point on each line), the decline of exogenous infant mortality at ages 1 to 11 months (the change in the slopes), the decline ofexogenous infant mortality under age 1 month (the change in the difference between the Y-intercept and the absent horizontal line extended from the lowest point on each line back to the Y-axis), and the decline of endogenous infant mortality (the change in the Y-intercept).
Table I presents the estimated rates obtained from the biometric model from 1935 to 1985 at five-year intervals. In order to avoid the estimation problem that arises from any deviations from linearity, ordinary least squares regression was used to obtain the best-fitting straight line for each year. The cumulative infant mortality rates were regressed on the biometric age coefficients to obtain a set of linear equations. The rates presented in Table 1 were calculated using these regression equations. The last column of Table 1 presents the ^-Square for the model used to calculate the rates for each year. Over time, the degree oflinearity hasdecreased as indicated bythe decline in K-Square from 0.9983 in 1935 to 0.9549 in 1985.
Table 1indicates that in 1935 theendogenous infant mortality rate was slightly lower than the total exogenous infant mortality rate (24.54 and 26.42 respectively). In 1940 and thereafter, the endogenous infant mortality rate was higher than the total exogenous infant mortality rate. Thus, these estimates suggest that, beginning sometime between 1935 and 1940, infant mortality in the United States changed from being primarily exogenous toprimarily endogenous in character. It is

important to remember that these estimates were obtained under the assumption that endogenous infant mortality is limited to the first month of life. If endogenous mortality occurs after age one month, then the biometric model will underestimate the endogenous infant mortality rate and overestimate the exogenous infant mortality rate. If this is the case, then the timing of the cross-over might shift. Additionally, infant mortality in the United States after the cross-over would be even more endogenous in character and the decline of exogenous infant mortality would be even greater than implied by these estimates.
Figure 3 illustrates the trends in the biometric model estimates of the total, endogenous, and total exogenous infant mortality rates from Table 1. In addition to the crossover between the endogenous and exogenous infant mortality rates which occurred between 1935 and 1940, Figure 3 illustrates that the exogenous infant mortality rate declined much more rapidly than the endogenous infant mortality

rate between 1935 and 1965. After 1965, the decline in the endogenous infant mortality rate sharpened. These trends are consistent with data presented by Bouvier and van der Tak (1976, Figure 3, p. 17). These authors present infant mortality rates by ageat death for the United States from 1915 to 1974.Beginning around 1965, there is a sharp downturn in the under-1-day and 1-2-day mortality rates. Between 1965 and 1974, the first-day and 1-2day mortality rates each declined by approximately 30 per cent. This substantial decline in endogenous mortality was attributed to "the recent progress in tackling the special threats which jeopardize a newborn infant's first days of life" (pp. 16-17).
CAUSE OF DEATH ANALYSIS
The estimates on which the foregoing analyses are based were derived from the biometric model which assumes that endogenous mortality isrestricted to the first month of life. If this underlying assumption is no longer

valid, so that an increasing proportion of the mortality from ages 1 to 11 months is due to endogenous causes, then the biométrie model should underestimate the endogenous mortality rate and overestimate the total exogenous mortality rate relative to estimates obtained from cause-of-death analysis. To address this question, I will compare the estimates derived from the biométrie model with estimates obtained from cause-of-death analysis using data for the United States for 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985. Bourgeois-Pichat employed this same analytic strategy to determine the validity of the empirical relationships which are the foundation of the biometric model (for example, see Bourgeois-Pichat, 1952¿>).
There are two reasons why 1970 was chosen as the cutoff for this analysis. First, a large part of the progress in the development of effective medical interventions that impact the survival chances of physiologically weak infants has occurred since 1970 (Hack et al., 1979). Major advances in neonatal intensive care, amniocentesis, ultrasound, advances in genetic-screening techniques for various congenital anomalies, selective abortions, fetal monitoring, and other medico-technological innovations aimed at either preventing the births of physiologically weak infants or sustaining their lives have emerged relatively recently. The choice of 1970 as the cutoff for this analysis is somewhat arbitrary with respect to this issue, although I considered it reasonable to assume that if a large or increasing proportion of deaths due to endogenous causes were being postponed until later in the first year of life, then it would be most apparent after 1970.

The second and more important reason for focusing on this time period arises from the need to have a consistent series of data available for the delineation of endogenous and exogenous of causes of death. The period 1970 to 1985 spans one revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD): the eighth revision of the ICD (ICD-8) covers the years 1970-1975, while the years 1980-1985 are covered by the ninth revision of the ICD (ICD9). To extend the analysis to include the period prior to 1970 would entail including at least one more, and, depending on how far back the analysis was extended, possibly many more revisions of the ICD. In order to include even this one revision of the classification system in the analysis, I had to assume that a consistent subset of endogenous and exogenous causes of death could be defined. While this may seem like a relatively benign assumption, it was necessary in light of the potential impact of the introduction of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as a distinct cause of death after 1979.
Various strategies have been suggested in the literature to deal with SIDS. Poston and Rogers (1985), Poston (1986), and Frisbie et al. (1991) exclude SIDS deaths from their analyses. Stockwell et al. (1987) classify SIDS as an endogenous cause of death. For the purposes of this analysis, I assume that SIDS is an exogenous cause of death and that deaths from SIDS in 1970 and 1975 were primarily attributed to exogenous cause-of-death categories. This assumption is based on the findings of Nam et al. (1989) and Leatherman (1991) that SIDS cases resemble deaths from accidents more than deaths from congenital anomalies on a number of background and

270

intermediate variables. Given that SIDS mortality tends to occur at ages older than 1 month and is more common than all other causes of mortality combined at age 3 months (Knight, 1983), and that social factors appear to influence SIDS mortality, the classification of SIDS as an exogenous cause of death in this analysis is reasonable.
In order to increase further the likelihood of delineating a consistent series of endogenous and exogenous causes of death, I have limited the analysis to broad categories of cause of death rather than specific causes of death. Congenital Anomalies and Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period are the two broad cause-ofdeath categories that I selected as endogenous causes. These two broad cause of death categories are "generally considered" to include the endogenous causes of death (Eberstein and Parker, 1985, p. 312). For the purpose of this analysis, all other causes of death are assumed to be exogenous.
Table 2 presents the specific causes of death included in the broad Congenital Anomalies and Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period categories by revision of the ICD. Comparison of the broad category of Congenital Anomalies across revisions of the classification system reveals that there was almost no change in the specific cause-of-death categories that comprise it. Thus, the broad cause-ofdeath category Congenital Anomalies appears to be consistent across the revision of the classification system.
Comparison of the Certain Causes of Mortality in Early Infancy (1970 and 1975) and Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period (1980 and 1985) categories, on the other hand, reveals that there was a consid-

erable amount of adjustment in the specific cause-of-death categories in addition to the change in the name of the category heading. For the purposes of this analysis, I assume that the Certain Causes of Mortality in Early Infancy category and the Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period category are comparable despite the fact that their finer subdivisions might not be. In other words, I assume that deaths that would fall under the heading of Certain Causes of Mortality in Early Infancy in 1970 and 1975 would fall under the heading of Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period in 1980 and 1985, although the specific causes of death to which they are attributed might not be the same.
As a check to make sure that these two broad categories of cause of death are suitable proxies for the endogenous causes of death, I examined the proportion of all mortality occurring under 24 hours, under 7 days, and under 1 month of age that was accounted for by these two cause of death categories. I hypothesized that if these two broad cause-of-death categories were in fact capturing the endogenous causes of death, then they should account for a very high percentage of the mortality within each of these age categories, particularly under 24 hours and under 7 days of age.
Table 3 shows the results of this analysis. The Congenital Anomalies and Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period categories account for 96.10 per cent of the mortality occurring under 24 hours in 1970, 95.20 per cent in 1975,97.85 per cent in 1980, and 97.55 per cent in 1985. For mortality occurring in the first week of life, these two categories account for 93.58

per cent, 92.17 per cent, 96.34 per cent, and 95.82 per cent for 1970,1975, 1980, and 1985 respectively. Approximately 90 per cent of the mortality under age 1 month is accounted for by these two cause-of-death categories in 1970, 88 per cent in 1975, and 93 per cent in 1980 and 1985 respectively. Thus, on the basis of this analysis, it seems reasonable to conclude that these two broad cause of death cate-

gories are suitable proxies for the endogenous cause of death.
It is interesting to note that the overall consistency of the proportion of the deaths within each of these age categories that are accounted for by the combination of these two broad cause of death categories masks a considerable amount of change in the relative contribution of each. In each of the three age categories, the proportion of

mortality attributable to the category Congenital Anomalies is increasing and the proportion attributable to the category Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period is decreasing. Considering the age category under 24 hours, the proportion of the mortality occurring at that age that is accounted for by the category Congenital Anomalies increased from 8>75 per cent in 1970 to 19.09 per cent in 1985, and the proportion attributable to Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period decreased from 87.35 per cent in 1970 to 78.46 per cent in 1985. For the age category under 7 days, the proportion of mortality that is accounted for by the category Congenital Anomalies increased from 12.00 per cent in 1970 to 23.52 per cent in 1985, and the proportion accounted for by the category Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period decreased from 81.58 per cent in 1970 to 72.30 per cent in 1985. Finally, under age 1 month, the proportion of the mortality that is accounted for by the category Congenital Anomalies increased from 13.29 per cent in 1970 to 24.33 per cent in 1985, and the proportion accounted for by the category Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period decreased from 76.29 per cent in 1970 to 68.52 per cent in 1985. The observed trend is primarily the result of the great reduction in the number of deaths due to Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period, particularly mortality attributable to low birth weight and prematurity.
Before turning to a discussion of the results of the comparison of the rates obtained from the biométrie model and cause-of-death analysis, I would like to discuss briefly the expected impact of

the use of the regression equations to correct for the nonlinearity in the biometric model. Referring back to Figure 2, we see that the biométrie transformations for these years indicate that the cumulative infant mortality rate increases more rapidly in the first few months of life than in the later months of the first year of life. On the basis of this pattern of nonlinearity, the bestfitting straight line obtained from the regression of the cumulative infant mortality rates on the biométrie age coefficients will overestimate the cumulative infant mortality rates at the beginning and the end of the first year of life and will underestimate the cumulative infant mortality rates in the middle of the first year of life. Thus, the use of the regression equations to obtain the biométrie estimates will tend to inflate the estimates of the total infant mortality rate and the estimates of the endogenous infant mortality rates since these are calculated at the extremes of the first year of life. This inflation bias should be kept in mind when examining the results of the comparisons of the total and endogenous infant mortality rates. With respect to the endogenous infant mortality rates calculated from the biométrie model, this inflation factor is particularly relevant because it was hypothesized that the biométrie model would underestimate this rate relative to cause of death analysis if endogenous mortality was being postponed past the first month of life.

age 1 month, and the exogenous infant mortality rate from ages 1 to 11 months of age obtained from the biometric model and cause of death analysis respectively. As expected, comparison of the total infant mortality rates shows that the biometric model overestimates this rate by 1.90 per cent in 1970, 2.35 per cent in 1975, 2.77 per cent in 1980, and 3.04 per cent in 1985. Comparison of the endogenous infant mortality rates derived from these two methods shows that the biometric model consistently underestimates the endogenous infant mortality rate relative to causeof-death analysis, and that from 1970

to 1985 the degree of underestimation increases. The per cent difference is -1.06 in 1970, -1.31 in 1975, -10.57 in 1980, and -11.51 in 1985. Comparison of the total exogenous infant mortality rate derived from these two methods shows that the biometric model consistently overestimates this rate relative to cause-of-death analysis, and the degree of overestimation increases from 9.87 per cent in 1970 to 35.14 per cent in 1985. These results are consistent with those that would be expected if a significant proportion of endogenous deaths are being postponed until later in the first year of

life. The large increase in the degree of underestimation of the endogenous infant mortality rate obtained from the biométrie model between 1975 and 1980 may in part be the result of the treatment of SIDS as an exogenous cause of death in this analysis. If some deaths under age 1 month that would have been attributed to an endogenous cause of death prior to the introduction of SIDS are attributed to SIDS after 1979 and are treated as exogenous in this analysis, then this change might in part account for the increased underestimation of endogenous mortality in 1980 and 1985. This increased underestimation might also in part be an artifact of changes in the pattern of nonlinearty in the biométrie transformation.
The results of this comparison are consistent with the hypothesis that advances in medicine have resulted in the short-term prolongation of life for some infants. Assuming that the estimates derived from this cause-of-death analysis are more accurate than those derived from the biométrie model, these results also indicate that the endogenous infant mortality rate did not decline as sharply as implied by the trends depicted in Figure 3. Thus, we can conclude that infant mortality in the United States during 1970 to 1985 was even more endogenous in character than implied by the trends in the biométrie model estimates shown in Figure 3.
Table 4 also shows the decomposition of the total exogenous infant mortality rate into the exogenous mortality rate under age 1 month and the exogenous mortality rate from 1 to 11 months of age. With respect to the exogenous infant mortality rate under age 1 month, the biométrie model

underestimates by 15.60 per cent in 1970 and 16.49 per cent in 1975 relative to cause-of-death analysis. However, in 1980 and 1985, the biométrie model overestimates this rate by 85.25 per cent and 87.08 per cent respectively. As discussed above, this change from underestimation to overestimation may in part be a result of changes in the pattern of nonlinearity in the biométrie transformation and may in part be a result of introduction of SIDS as a specific cause of death after 1979.
With respect to the exogenous infant mortality rate from 1 to 11 months, the biométrie model consistently overestimates relative to causeof-death analysis: in 1970, the per cent difference is 19.44; in 1975, the per cent difference is 21.58; in 1980, the per cent difference is 24.71; and in 1985, the per cent difference is 25.86. Since it is assumed that no endogenous mortality occurs after age 1 month, all deaths from age 1 to 11 months contribute to the biométrie model estimate of exogenous mortality. The cause-ofdeath estimate of exogenous mortality from 1 to 11 months, on the other hand, is based only on deaths between ages 1 and 11 months which are not attributed to the broad cause-of-death categories Congenital Anomalies and Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period. Thus, this result suggests that there may be considerable endogenous mortality after the first month of life.

infant mortality rate has declined more rapidly than the exogenous infant mortality rate over this period. The second column shows that the percentage of all infant deaths that are accounted for by endogenous deaths under age 1 month declined from 67.99 per cent in 1970 to 60.72 per cent in 1985.The third column shows that the percentage of all infant deaths that are accounted for by endogenous deaths at 1 to 11 months of age increased from 4.92per cent in 1970 to 8.30 per cent in1985. Thus, it appears that part of the decline in the proportion of all infant mortality that is accounted for by deaths occurring under age 1 month is the result of the short-term prolongation of life for some infants.
Tables 7 and 8 present this same analysis for the cause-of-death categories Congenital Anomalies and Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period separately in order to determine their independent contributions.

The second column of Table 7 shows that the percentage of all infant deaths that are accounted for by deaths attributable to the category Congenital Anomalies under age 1month increased from 10.49 per cent in 1970to 15.91 per cent in 1985.

1970 to 2.83 per cent in 1985. This represents a nine-fold increase over the course of fifteen years.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
I have shown that there is increasing nonlinearity in the biométrie model transformation for the United States. Comparison of the endogenous and exogenous infant mortality rates obtained from the biométrie model and cause-of-death analysis respectively indicates that the biométrie model underestimates the endogenous infant mortality rate and overestimates the exogenous infant mortality rate relative to cause-of-death analysis. This finding is consistent with what would be expected if endogenous infant mortality occurred after the first month of life.
Direct examination of the age pattern of infant mortality from all causes indicates that the proportion of mortality occurring under age 1 month declined from 75.37 per cent in 1970 to 65.40 per cent in 1985. Furthermore, the proportion of all infant mortality that is attributable to endogenous deaths at ages 1-11 months increased from 4.92 per cent in 1970 to 8.30 per cent in 1985. This change was due primarily to the increase in the proportion of deaths at 1-11 months of age that were attributable to the category Certain Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period. Finally, at each age from 1 to 11 months, between 20 and 30 per cent of deaths are attributable to endogenous causes.
Taken together, these results are consistent with the argument that advances in medicine have been effective

in reducing mortality due to endogenous causes. However, these results also suggest that advances in medicine may result in the short-term prolongation of life for a significant number of infants. Finally, these results indicate that endogenous mortality occurs throughout the whole of the first year of life and may even extend beyond it.
In this paper I have argued that the biométrie model no longer provides a reasonable empirical characterization of infant mortality in the United States because the assumption that endogenous mortality is confined to the first month of life is increasingly violated. Due to the short-term prolongation of the lives of some infants, the biométrie model consistently underestimates the endogenous infant mortality rate and overestimates the total exogenous infant mortality rate relative to cause-ofdeath analysis. While the results reported in this paper are specific to the United States, it is probable that similar results could be found for other more developed countries, and possibly some less developed countries as well. This research suggests that new empirical models which incorporate endogenous mortality that occurs after the first month of life should be developed.
