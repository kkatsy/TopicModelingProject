ABSTRACT: The perinatal mortality rate is known to increase with parity. This parity effect is shown to be steepest for "O"-type mothers, compared to mothers with blood groups A, B, or AB. Thus, there is a heightened parity effect in mothers who are likeliest to be antigenically dissimilar from their fetuses. This model may also be germane to other clinical conditions where negative parity effects are observed. Maternal-fetal immunoreactivity is a likely explanation for parity effects on perinatal mortality attributable to ABO incompatibility and may also contribute to the occurrence of negative parity effects in other conditions.

The paradox of pregnancy is that circulating maternal antibodies against the histocompatibility antigens of the fetus develop simultaneously with the specific inhibition of immune reactivity against the fetus as a graft (Simmons, 1971). However, there are instances where mechanisms of fetal immunoprotection break down. Maternal immune attack upon the fetus plays a central role in pathologic conditions like Rh disease, runt disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia, myaesthenia gravis and thyroiditis (Brent, 1971). Spontaneous abortion and perinatal death may also be consequences of maternal-fetal immunoreactivity.
It is our contention that maternalfetal immunoreactivity may also contribute to other pathologic conditions in which a "negative parity effect" is observed. The development of maternal antibodies to fetal antigens increases with successive pregnancies (Doughty and Gelsthrope, 1976), and maternal immunoreactivity may therefore be expected, in certain circumstances, to ex-

ert deleterious effects upon the course or outcome of successive pregnancies. Negative parity effects, i.e., an increased likelihood of untoward outcome with increasing birth order, have been described in connection with stillbirth and perinatal mortality (Niswander and Gordon, 1972), mental retardation (Belmont et al., 1972), specific learning disabilities (Nichols and Chen, 1981), infant characteristics (Waldrop and Bell, 1966), height (Belmont et al., 1975), birth weight and placental size (Vernier, 1975), and IQ (Belmont and Marolla, 1973).
Maternal-fetal ABO incompatibility is known to occasion an increased incidence of fetal wastage (Cohen, 1970). Since it is likely that this phenomenon has an immunoreactive basis, we thought that perinatal mortality as a consequence of ABO incompatibility might be a good model for demonstrating how maternal-fetal immunoreactivity may be manifested as a negative parity effect. Since it is already known that a negative parity effect exists for still-

should be demonstrably sharper. With

respect to ABO incompatibility, the

idea would be supported by the demon-

stration of a greater parity effect on peri-

natal mortality in children of O-type

The data are from the British Perina-

tal Study (Butler and Bonham, 1963).

The perinatal mortality rate for a sample

of 14,732 pregnancies was related to ma-

ternal ABO type and parity (see Table

1). It is found that within each maternal

blood group, the perinatal mortality

rate increases with parity. As predicted,

the slope of the mortality/parity regression line is substantially steeper for O mothers than for A, B, or AB mothers (see Figure 1).

ABO Incompatiability

The significance of this difference was tested by analysis of variance with orthogonal polynomial decomposition (unweighted means). The interaction, birth order (linear) x maternal ABO status (O vs. A, B, and AB) x perinatal mortality rate was significant (F[l,14730] = 4.30, P< 0.05).
Parity effects on perinatal mortality are most strongly felt by O mothers, who are also most prone to develop an immune reaction to fetal blood group antigens. Heightened maternal-fetal immunoreactivity is thus manifest in a sharper parity effect.

Since fetal ABO status was not available in the data base from the British Perinatal Study, it was not possible to perform a more incisive analysis of maternal-fetal ABO incompatibility relative to parity effects and perinatal mortality. Nevertheless, the fact that maternal-fetal incompatibility can contribute to and be demonstrated in the slope of the negative parity effect may be useful to research in other pathologic conditions where negative parity effects are known to exist. It is conceivable that maternal-fetal immunoreactivity may play a role in their development as well.
