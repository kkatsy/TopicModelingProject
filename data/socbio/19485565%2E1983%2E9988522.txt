ABSTRACT: The frequency of consanguineous marriages was studied in three endogamous castes, the Reddis (Kapus), Yadavas (Gollas), and Madigas of Marripadu village in South India. Inbreeding was higher among the Yadavas (Gollas) (0.0312) and Madigas (0.0271) than among the Reddis (Kapus) (0.0154) due to their higher frequencies of uncle-niece marriages.

Studies in many parts of the world MATERIALS AND METHODS

have shown a significant decline in the frequency of consanguineous marriages (Pohlman, 1951; Deraemaeker, 1958; Blanco and Chakrahorty, 1975, etc.). However, in South India over the past few decdes consanguineous marriages have not declined significantly {Andhra Pradesh: Dronam Raju and Meerakhan, 1963; Sanghvi, 1966; Chakravartti, 1968; Reid, 1973; Veerraju, 1973; Rami Reddy and Papa Rao, 1978a, b; Roychoudhury, 1976; Tamil Nadu: Centerwall and Centerwall, 1966; Srinivasan and Mukherjee, 1976; Rao and Inbaraj, 1977; and Roychoudhury, 1978; Karnatka: Roy-

The data were collected from the multicaste village of Marripadu, in Kovur taluk, Nellore District, Andhra Pradesh. The sample of 209 marriages includes 59 Reddis (Kapus), an agricultural caste; 82 Yadavas (Gollas), a shepherd caste; and 68 Madigas, a scheduled caste. Information on the different types of consanguineous marriages was ascertained from the detailed pedigrees drawn on oral information from respondents' families and village elders. The mean inbreeding coefficient was calculated for the three groups separately following Wright (1922).

higher in Reddis (Kapus) and Madigas than in Yadavas (Gollas). There is a negligible difference in the frequency of marriages between first cousins once removed and second cousins. Marriages of second cousins once removed are prevalent only among the Yadavas (Gollas). The average inbreeding coefficients were: Yadavas (Gollas) (0.0312); Madigas (0.0271); and Reddis (Kapus) (0.0154).
DISCUSSION
In our study the major contribution to the average inbreeding coefficient comes from the uncle-niece and crossfirst-cousintypes of marriages. Of the three caste groups studied, the Reddis (Kapus) showed the lowest inbreeding coefficient due to the low frequency of uncle-niece marriages; in Yadavas (Gollas) and Madigas, the frequencies of such marriages are slightly higher than those of cross-first-cousin marriages.
Our findings, except for those on the Reddis (Kapus), differ from those of Sanghvi (1966) who earlier reported higher frequencies of consanguineous marriages between matrilateral crosscousins in rural Andhra Pradesh. However, Sundar Rao (1971) observed in Tamil Nadu populations a significant decline in the frequency of cross-firstcousin marriages but not in uncle-niece marriages.
The foregoing account shows that the practice of consanguinity varies from ethnic group to ethnic group, which is most likely due to diverse cultural practices of deep-rooted origin and antiquity. Hence the preference for certain types of related marriages is witnessed even today in different proportions in various ethnic groups including the samples of our study.
