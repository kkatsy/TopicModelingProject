The potential contribution of organized family-planning programs to fertility decline and the reduction of population growth is the subject of a "lively debate," as Potter and his colleagues (1968) have observed, among demographers, health workers, and policy makers (Berelson, 1967; Davis, 1967; Häuser, 1967; Notestein, 1967). While the population problem in developing countries differs both in magnitude and urgency from the United States, the same basic challenges have been addressed to the validity of assigning priority to family-planning efforts at home and abroad.
Drawing on their experience in Taiwan and Korea, Potter, Freedman, and Chow (1968) have marshalled selective documentation of both increased birth control practice and decreased fertility as a result of these programs, refuting "the argument that the program is trivial because the participants are too old, too few, or too poorly motivated to practice contraception with any persistence or with any significant effect on fertility" (p. 852).
* An earlier version of this paper was presented before the American Public Health Association, Detroit, November, 1968.

In the United States, the impact of organized family-planning programs on fertility patterns has been difficult to measure because these programs have usually served only small segments of the population in large metropolitan areas where it is difficult to assess the effect of migration and changing age composition (Bogue, 1965). Nevertheless, the subject is of considerable significance, given recent estimates of the magnitude of unwanted fertility ranging from a minimum of 450,000 births annually among poor and near-poor couples (Campbell, 1968) to a minimum of 850,000 annually for all couples in the United States (Jaffee and Guttmacher, 1968).
This paper presents data collected in a family-planning research and demonstration program initiated in a rural southern parish (county) in 1,965. The program is continuing, and the data presented here must be regarded as preliminary. Nevertheless, changes have been observed in both fertility and illegitimacy trends in this parish since the program began, and the possible relationship of these changes to the family-planning program can at least be suggested.

Apart from the possible demographic significance, there are other valid reasons for the detailed evaluation of the impact of organized family-planning programs in the United States. The yearly increase in the number of out-of-wedlock births since 1940 (Clague and Ventura, 1968) has evoked widespread concern both among the general public and various professional groups. The problem is of particular importance to health workers because out-of-wedlock births are associated with a higher incidence of maternal death, stillbirth, infant death, and prematurity. Moreover, the early initiation of childbearing is associated both with

nature of these problems and expanded support of programs which hold promise of reducing their incidence.
BACKGROUND
The Lincoln Parish Family Planning Program was initiated as a research and demonstration program for family-planning and population studies in a rural county of Louisiana in September, 1965. A survey was carried out on a probability sample of all women who had experienced a reproductive event and declared Lincoln Parish as their place of residence from 1960 through 1964. The husbands of these women were

high rates of premarital conception and with significantly lower ultimate income levels for the family (Freedman and Coombs, 1966). This relationship would appear to hold whether or not the conception is subsequently legitimized by marriage (Pakter and Nelson, 1965). Children born out of wedlock also are often stigmatized by society, do not relate to a male figure in their early years, and generally have more chance of being handicapped in both their physical and emotional development. For these reasons, illegitimacy and premarital conception are national health and social problems of considerable magnitude. However, the health problems alone provide ample justification for broader investigation into the

also studied (Beasley and Parrish, 1968). Simultaneously, the demographic characteristics of Lincoln Parish and the four surrounding parishes, Bienville, Claiborne, Jackson, and Union, were evaluated. Selected findings from the evaluation are presented in Table 1. We concluded that Lincoln Parish and the four surrounding parishes have many characteristics which are similar both to each other and to other rural counties in the southern United States. While the term "control" cannot be used in the classical sense in referring to the four surrounding parishes, these parishes did approximate as near a control situation as could be achieved in a field experiment of this kind. Henceforth, we will refer to

Lincoln Parish as the study parish and the
four surrounding parishes as the control
parishes.
The selection of a study parish as the site
for the pilot family-planning program was
governed by the following criteria:
1. The parish should have fertility and familyplanning problems similar to those in most non-Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area counties in the south.
2. It should contain a complete governmental unit and a population of 25,000 to 50,000, with no city having a population greater than 20,000.
3. Thirty to sixty per cent of its population should be nonwhite.
4. Its crude birthrate should be above 20. 5. Some medical personnel and facilities should
be available as well as public and private sector medical personnel willing to cooperate in the program. 6. The medical personnel and facilities available, both public and private, should not be greatly dissimilar to those actually or potentially available in other rural southern counties. 7. The study parish should be surrounded by other parishes with similar mechanisms for the provision of health care.

come of less than $3,000. As Table 2 shows, the population in the study parish and in most of the control parishes increased from 1960 to 1966, rather than decreased, with the largest increase occurring in the study parish.
Table 3 depicts estimates of the general fertility rates for the five parishes. In 1960, Lincoln Parish had the lowest general fertility rate. The 1966 estimates indicate that in these parishes, as in the rest of the United States, there has been a decrease in fertility rates.
Therefore, we judged the five parishes were similar enough in their major characteristics to yield comparative data of interest, particularly since the main change that has occurred since 1965 in the provision of health care in these parishes has been the implementation of the Family Planning Demonstration Program in Lincoln Parish. Family-planning services are available in the four control parishes but

The survey of Lincoln Parish families revealed a marked lack of information about the most elemental aspects of reproduction among the lower socioeconomic group. Only about 30% of the lower socioeconomic families had any meaningful understanding of

human reproduction, beyond the fact that intercourse and pregnancy are related, as compared with 86% of upper socioeconomic group respondents. However, more than 83% of the lower socioeconomic group felt that a couple has a right to decide for themselves the number and timing of their children, and 84% expressed a desire for more information about family-planning methods. It is also of interest that around 70% of the middle socioeconomic group and 40% of the upper socioeconomic group also wanted more family-planning information. The main reason given by families not desiring this type of information in the middle and

premised on the hypothesis that the provision of adequate information and services would result in a high level of utilization by lower socioeconomic couples. The emphasis in designing the program was on identifying, contacting, and educating the target population, providing adequate family-planning services, and developing a follow-up system appropriate for the maintenance of the patient population.
Prior to inaugurating full-scale operations, the medical, religious, educational, political, and civic leaders of the area were systematically contacted and advised of the need for a family-planning clinic. The final principles of operation of the program, including a policy prohibiting services to women who have not been married or pregnant, were governed by the agreements reached with these groups.

upper socioeconomic group was that 90% reported they were already practicing some acceptable form of family planning.
In summary, the preliminary survey indicated that the lower socioeconomic group, depending primarily upon tax-supported facilities for medical care and lacking information about reproductive physiology and contraceptive methods, did have a strong feeling that a couple had a right to decide for themselves the number and timing of their children and were highly interested in additional family-planning information and services. It did not seem that any major motivational blocks existed among the lower socioeconomic group to prevent their acceptance of family-planning services.
The design of the program, therefore, was

THE PROGRAM
Services and information were made available on September 10, 1965 to Lincoln Parish residents who met the criteria defining medical indigency. This clinic, the first family-planning clinic in Louisiana, is located in the Lincoln Parish Public Health Unit in Ruston. The plan was to identify and offer services to all medically indigent females of reproductive age in need of family-planning services. However, since there was no established way of identifying these women, a system was developed to identify, contact, and follow-up patients.
The first step was to identify the women by name and address. This was accomplished through the use of birth certificate information furnished by the Louisiana State Department of Health and by delivery record information furnished by the three charity hospitals where 95% of the medically indigent women in Lincoln Parish deliver their babies. This method left unidentified a segment of the medically indigent population of reproductive age, the size of which we had no way of determining at that time.

The second step was to locate the women identified and to determine how many of them were available to participate in a family-planning program. The women were contacted according to the following priorities:
1. Current postpartum women. 2. High-risk women.1 3. Low-risk women.2
The overall design of the program has been described in detail in a previous report (Beasley and Parrish, 1968).
Although initiated in September, 1965, the program was in the developmental stage until March 1, 1966. All of the identifiable patients in the categories described above were contacted by July 12, 1967, and the results through that date are presented here. Any effect of the family planning program upon fertility and illegitimacy trends would therefore be reflected at the earliest in the calendar year 1967.
We identified a total of 1,055 medically indigent patients who had a vital event registered between January 1, 1960 and July 12, 1967 (Table 4). An attempt was made to reach each potential patient by personal contact. Approximately 32% were not available to participate in the program because they had been surgically sterilized, were pregnant, had moved from the parish, could not be located, or were negative toward family planning. However, 719 women (68%) were both identifiable and available, and 412 of them accepted an appointment and attended the clinic. This constituted an acceptance rate of more than 57% of the identifiable and available patients who were offered an appointment at the clinic.
1 The high-risk criteria are: (1) parity 6 or more; (2) latest delivery occurred out of wedlock; (3) history of stillbirth; (4) one or more children born alive now dead; (5) less than 17 or over 39 years of age; (6) latest delivery a multiple birth; and (7) latest delivery premature.
2 The low-risk group consists of the members of the identifiable medically indigent population who have not been classified as high-risk.

Table 5 depicts some of the characteristics of the total universe of 1,055 identifiable medically indigent women. Three hundred ninety-six were judged to be low-risk patients, and 659, or 62.5%, high-risk patients. Of all the women in the identifiable medically indigent universe, 349 had experienced an illegitimate birth.

In addition to the program's efforts to contact identifiable prospective patientsdirectly, some nonidentifiable patients were referred to the clinic from other agencies and by friends or relatives who had attended the clinic. Table 6 shows that the total number of referrals from alloutside sources was 74, of whom 60 attended the clinic.

Thus, of all patients who attended the clinic during this period, only 12% came on their own initiative or were referred by an outside source. I t is our belief this indicates thevalue of a systematic approach to the identification, contact, education, and service of the entire medically indigent patient universe. In our opinion, simply opening a family-planning program without adequate outreach and follow-up mechanisms would have resulted in amuch smaller response.

over 43% had experienced one or more outof-wedlock pregnancies. This would seem to indicate a very strong motivation on the part of many of these women to seek, utilize, and continue family planning when it is offered in a manner acceptable to them.
For analyzing the impact of the program, our findings incorporate two of the three basic measures of illegitimacy, namely, the number and ratio (the number of illegiti-

Unfortunately, they do not incorporate the rate of illegitimacy (the number of illegitimate births per thousand unmarried females aged 15 to 44) since the denominator to determine the number of unmarried females of childbearing age is unavailable until the 1970 census.

indigent births for Lincoln Parish and the four control parishes. The number of indigent births in both Lincoln Parish and the control parishes gradually decreased from 1964 through 1966. In 1967--the first year in which the program's impact could be expected--the number of Lincoln Parish indigent births decreased 32% from the previous year. In the control parishes, the decrease between 1966 and 1967 was only 6%-
Table 15 presents the 1966-67 changes in the number of medically indigent live births by age of mother in Lincoln Parish and in the control parishes. The rationale behind this table is that if a genuine decrease in the number of indigent births has been occurring in Lincoln Parish and the program has been serving primarily young women of low parity, the main decreases between 1966 and 1967 should be reflected in the younger age groups. As can be seen in Table 15, there was a 21.6% decrease in the number of medically indigent births

occurring in the 19 or younger age group, a 52.1% decrease in the 20-24 year age group, and a 37.5% decrease in the 25-29 year age group.
In the control parishes, however, the percentage of decrease in these age groups from 1966 to 1967 is much smaller, which indicates that the changes occurring in Lincoln Parish are not being reflected in the control parishes.

In the control parishes, except for an 1 1 % reduction in 1965 for which no explanation is available, there has been no general change over the four years; in 1966 and 1967 there were slight increases. In Lincoln Parish, the number remained fairly constant during 1964, 1965, and 1966. In 1967, however, only 47 medically indigent out-of-wedlock births were recorded, a sharp

drop of 40% from 1966. No other change of this magnitude has been observed in 1967 in any other parish in the state.
Table 17 shows all out-of-wedlock live births reported to both indigent and nonindigent mothers in Lincoln and the control parishes. Of the 60 out-of-wedlock births in Lincoln Parish, 47 were classified as indigent. Although the total number of outof-wedlock births reported in the control parishes decreased rather markedly in 1965, during 1966 and 1967 they remained relatively constant. In Lincoln Parish the number remained stable up until 1967 when there was a 30% decrease in the total number of illegitimate births reported. Again, this is the first parish in the state to observe a change of this order in the total number of out-of-wedlock births.

of family-planning knowledge and practice in the low-income community could have some possible influence on persons whoare not patients in the program. Our data indicate that a large number of patients who had previously experienced out-of-wedlock births were brought into theprogram during the years 1965through 1967. We would expect that if the 1966-67 changes in Lincoln Parish which we have observed in the number of indigent out-of-wedlock births, the total number of out-of-wedlock births, and the illegitimacy ratio are due to the impact of the family-planning program, then the major proportion of these decreases should

having second or higher order births out of wedlock remained essentially constant. However, between 1966 and 1967 there was a marked decrease of 41.5% when only 31 second or higher order births were reported. This is the group of patients who were most affected by the family planning program.
SUMMARY
Among five contiguous rural Louisiana parishes with similar sociodemographic characteristics, an organized family-planning program was initiated in 1965 in one parish (Lincoln). Family-planning services are available to medically indigent couples in the other parishes, but they are not organized as those described in Lincoln Parish. Preliminary evidence indicates that in 1967 there were significantly greater decreases observed in Lincoln Parish than in the four surrounding parishes in the following indices:
1. Total number of medically indigent births. 2. Total number of out-of-wedlock live births. 3. Total number of medically indigent out-of-
wedlock live births. 4. The ratio of indigent out-of-wedlock live
births per thousand indigent live births. 5. The ratio of illegitimate live births per thou-
sand live births.
An examination of the illegitimacy ratio revealed a marked decrease in the illegitimacy ratio of mothers of second or higher parity. Since the program policy limited participation to women who had ever been married or pregnant, the effect of the program on medically indigent out-of-wedlock

births would be reflected primarily in these higher parities.
We believe that the family-planning program initiated in 1965, particularly its design for systematic identification and contact of the medically indigent population and adequate provision of services, is principally responsible for the changes observed in Lincoln Parish in 1967, compared to the control parishes. This paper reports only two years' program experience, and it is still impossible to rule out the effect of chance variation on the trends observed.
There is a popular feeling that poor women and those who have experienced an out-of-wedlock pregnancy are not interested in family planning. The data presented concerning acceptance and continuing participation of these women in the Lincoln Parish program provide evidence to repudiate this myth.
