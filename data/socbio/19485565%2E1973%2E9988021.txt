Recent research has suggested a direct relationship between the demographic structure of a population and the operation of evolutionary forces. Consequently, studies of demographic dynamics and social organization are recognized as necessary prerequisites for the understanding of the genetic differentiation of human populations. The importance of an historical perspective for demographic and genetic observations has been emphasized by a number of workers who have interpreted the evolutionary implications of historical fluctuations in population structure, size, breeding patterns, and movement in various geographic areas and contexts (Bailit, Damon, and Damon, 1966; Benoist, 1964; Bonne, 1963, 1966; Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1969; Dobson and Roberts, 1971; Eaton and Mayer, 1953; Fitch and Neel, 1969; Kraus and White, 1956; Kuchemann, Boyce, and Harrison, 1967; Laughlin, 1966; Mange, 1964; McKusick et al., 1964; Niswander et al., 1970; Oliveira and Salzano, 1969; Roberts, 1971; Spuhler and Clark, 1961; Ward and Neel, 1970.)
The present study, one segment of an ongoing population genetics investigation of Indian and Mestizo populations of Tlaxcala, Mexico, attempts to ascertain from

historical records and biological data the rate and degree of genetic admixture between Indian and Spanish populations which began in 1519. The formal genetic analyses conducted by Crawford et al. (ms.) have disclosed that a considerable portion of the present Tlaxcalan gene pool may be of Spanish origin, even though relatively few Spaniards resided in the state during and after the military conquest of Mexico. The primary purpose of this paper is to outline some of the historical and demographic factors involved in this extensive admixture process. A major objective of the present approach is to reconstruct the numerical effects of historical events on the population of the state of Tlaxcala, and to provide an in-depth analysis of one representative village, San Bernardino Contla. The genetic and evolutionary consequences of specific historical occurrences are discussed in the light of a comparison of the demographic features of Tlaxcalan populations in earlier time periods with recent Indian and Mestizo populations investigated by Halberstein and Crawford (1972) in two regions of Tlaxcala.
Tlaxcala is the smallest state in Mexico, with an area of approximately 4,400 square kilometers and a population of 454,000.

The state occupies the central and northern parts of the Tlaxcala-Pueblan Valley in the southern zone of the central Mexican highlands, and it is geographically separated from the Valley of Mexico by volcanoes and mountain ranges on the western boundary. Tlaxcala is comprised of 44 municipios, or independent political subdivisions.

The contemporary populations analyzed are a large Indian municipio, San Pablo del Monte, and a Mestizo population in the city of Tlaxcala. Demographic data were collected through a standardized questionnaire administered to 3SO informants, both in public health clinics and through door-to-door interviews. Information was

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Aspects of the demographic history of the state of Tlaxcala in general, and San Bernardino Contla in particular, are reconstructed from several published sources: accounts by historians, such as Camargo (1948), Bernai Diaz (1SS6, 1S68), Prescott (1843), and Gibson (1964, 1967); religious documents by Mendieta (1945) and Motolinia (1969); and the anthropological research conducted in the Tlaxcalan area over the past fourteen years by Nutini (1961, 1965, 1968, ms.). Colonial census materials, located in the archives of the City of Tlaxcala, provided information on population size at fifty-year intervals between 1531 and 1839.

obtained for 3,575 living and deceased consanguinal relatives from these populations. The principal demographic variables which are described and compared by computer cross-tabulations include population structure and movement, mate selection, age at marriage, differential fertility, and mortality (Halberstein and Crawford, 1972).
ETHNOHISTORY OF TLAXCALA
Archeological evidence indicates that pre-contact settlements in Tlaxcala were situated on bluffs and valley walls, thus avoiding the ill-drained lowlands (Snow, 1969). The Spanish were largely responsible for the establishment of habitations on the valley floor with the drainage of

the lowlands and the introduction of improved tilling implements. According to Camargo (1948), the original inhabitants of Tlaxcala were Olmec and Zacatecan tribes. These groups were conquered by Nahuatl-speaking Teochichimec peoples who invaded from the north in the fourteenth century and forced the aboriginal residents into peripheral zones surrounding the state. These Náhuatl speakers, later known as Tlaxcalans, formed the communities encountered by Cortes in 1519.
There is conflicting opinion as to the exact dimensions of the pre-contact Tlaxcalan republic. Gibson (1967, pp. 6-10) estimates that the total area of the four principalities of the old republic of Tlaxcala (in existence until 1519) was smaller than the present state. Cook and Simpson (1948, p. 36) and Nutini (1968), however, contend that there is a close correspondence between the borders of the old republic and the Tlaxcala of today. The latter author reports that Tlaxcalans have always maintained a high degree of ethnic unity and territorial integrity.
Gibson (1967, p. 15) andPrescott (1843, Vol. I, p. 412) state that the Tlaxcalans had become unified, traditional enemies of the Aztecs of Central Mexico by 1519. They point out that when the Tlaxcalans confronted the invading Spaniards, they were already sensitized to external threats from the militaristic Aztecs, led by Montezuma and his predecessors. The Tlaxcalan army, however, reacted to the advancing Spanish forces with disorganized, and mostly unsuccessful, resistance. Bernai Diaz (1556, p. 121), a chronicler and one of the conquerers, writes that only twenty-three days passed between the crossing of the Tlaxcalan border and the victory march into the capital city. He refers to just two major battles between Spanish and Tlaxcalan troops, followed by consultation and negotiations which resulted in the forma-

tion of an alliance against the Aztecs known as the Segura de la Frontera.
Bernai Diaz (1568, p. 269) describes the treatment of the Spaniards by the Tlaxcalans after the treaty was established: "We were hospitably received and entertained in their cities after our fatigues, dangers, and losses in the retreats from Mexico." Gibson (1967, p. 89) and Prescott (1843, Vol. I l l , p. 249) note that as a reward for their military assistance and other services, the Tlaxcalans were granted a considerable measure of freedom and autonomy following the Conquest. Cook and Borah (1971, pp. 19-20) indicate that Tlaxcalans were also allowed sizeable exemptions in their colonial taxes and tributes.
According to the archives, the Spaniards assumed an administrative role in three major cities: Tlaxcala, Santa Ana Chiautempan, and Huamantala. Since the state of Tlaxcala is located on the direct route which Spanish soldiers travelled from the east coast of Mexico to the Aztec capital Tenotchtitlán, many transient Spanish officials, assistants, and infantrymen could be found in the state throughout the entire war period and until 1750 (Nutini, ms.).
POPULATION TRENDS IN THE STATE OF TLAXCALA, 1519-1970
At the time of the arrival of the Spaniards in 1519, the population of Tlaxcala numbered approximately 300,000, but by 1531 it had diminished to 250,000 inhabitants (see Fig. 2). In 1556 Viceroy Velasco ordered a statewide census. An examination of this document revealed that 196,703 residents were counted in that year, and that the average household consisted of 6.2 persons. By 1575 the population had decreased further to 150,000, and immediately preceding the turn of the seventeenth century Tlaxcala reached its lowest population level--100,000. Thus, in 81 years (1519-1600) the population was reduced

by two-thirds, with an average decrease of approximately 2,500 per year. From 1600 to 1823 the population underwent a gradual but steady increment (averaging 450 per year) to 200,000, but was still only two-thirds of the size of the pre-contact population. The latest recorded date for the influx of Spanish administrators is 1750; 1823 marks the official termination of the colonial supervision of Tlaxcala. Between 1830 and 1920 the population level rose at an average rate of 1,100 per year, finally approaching its pre-Hispanic strength of 300,000. Thus, the initial loss of two-thirds of the population in the 81 years from 1519 to 1600 was not replaced until more than three centuries later. The state of Tlaxcala has continued to increase numerically, with a population of 346,699 in 1960 (America en cifras, 1970, p. 31), and an estimated 454,000 at present (Paxton, 1970, p. 1143).
It is evident from Figure 2 that disease epidemics were in part responsible for the rapid depopulation of Tlaxcala in the sixteenth century. The widespread smallpox epidemics of 1519 and 1532 are attributed by Bernai Diaz (1568) to single carriers. The disease designated "plague," which

according to Sahagun (1938, Vol. I l l , p. 303; Vol. IV, p. 122) struck in 1520 and 1585-1588, was probably a generalized and contagious bacterial infection (Cockburn and Crawford, ms). Gibson (1967, p. 138) reports that "plague" flared up at ten-year intervals between 1519 and the end of the sixteenth century. In the same respect, the "cholera" discussed by Mendieta (1945) and cited by Gibson (1967, p. 138) was probably an acute, communicable gastro-intestinal disorder which claimed many lives. Measles rose to epidemic proportions in both 1530 and 1595 (Mendieta, 1945; Nutini, ms.). Cockburn and Crawford (ms.) discovered that typhus was prevalent in Tlaxcala from 1560 to 1600, with sporadic recurrences until the introduction of preventive measures in recent years.
At least three sizeable emigrations affected the population of Tlaxcala between 1519 and 1650. Prescott (1843, Vol. II, pp. 66, 393) writes that in 1519 Cortes enlisted some 6,000 Tlaxcalan warriors for a major drive into Aztec territory and that this contingent exhibited a considerable depletion upon its return in 1520. Torquemada (1723, Vol. I, p. 669; Vol.

III, p. 341) and Gibson (1967, p.185) describe a major colonizing effort by the Spaniards in 1591 which involved the emigration of 401 Tlaxcalan families drawn from all four principalities of the republic. The migrants were relocated to four new villages in the north near San Luis Potosí and Saltillo and to two additional locations to the west of Tlaxcala. According to Gibson (1964, p. 242), an agricultural

Figure 3 depicts the population trends of San Bernardino Contla for the period 1519-1970. The figures were obtained from colonial censuses and the data of Nutini.

POPULATION TRENDS IN SAN
BERNARDINO CONTLA, 1519-1970
San Bernardino Contla, a large, predominantly Indian municipio in south-central Tlaxcala, was selected for a microscopic analysis of demographic changes in Tlaxcala

The pre-Conquest population of the village in 1519was approximately 6,800,and the Velasco census of 1556 recorded 4,290 residents. In 1627 the size of San Bernardino Contla reached itslowest point, 1,871. Thus, in 108 years the population dwindled to about one-fourth of its previous level in 1519. During the period from 1720to 1800 some outward migrations occurred dueto dissatisfaction with internal political affairs. Between 1820 and 1823 self-government and independence were restored.The

90 years from 18S0 to 1940 witnessed a steady growth of the population until it approached its pre-Hispanic size of 6,800. Therefore, the initial reduction in population level over 108 years (1519-1627) was not replenished until 313 years later (1940). The population of San Bernardino Contla continued to increase in the three subsequent decades, with 7,900 inhabitants in 1950; 10,058 in 1960; and 11,010 in 1970. It appears that a new level of numerical equilibrium has been established in the past ten years, since population growth has become relatively stabilized.
FERTILITY STUDIES
Some data on fertility patterns in San Bernardino Contla were included in the more complete government censuses. The largest samples of married women were available in the 1786 and 1839 records. Table 1 outlines the trends of fertility for those years.

or moved away, and thus the actual levels of achieved reproduction are probably somewhat higher.
Reproductive behavior in Indian and Mestizo populations of Tlaxcala in 1969 was investigated by Halberstein and Crawford (1972), utilizing a demographic proforma. Table 2 reveals that the recent populations exhibit much higher overall statistics for mean number of living offspring and variance in progeny number for all married women, as well as for those past age forty.
POPULATION STRUCTURE
Population pyramids with age and sex breakdowns were constructed from the available census materials for 1786 and 1839 in San Bernardino Contla, using samples of individuals for whom exact ages were reported, (see Fig. 4). Both of the population pyramids have broad bases, suggesting that, despite the indication of low

The mean number of living offspring per prolific female for 1786 and 1839 is low (2.9 and 2.36, respectively), compared to the figures for present Indian communities. Variance in number of progeny per female is likewise low. Relatively high sterility rates were found for married women past forty years of age. It must be pointed out that the censuses did not provide information on those children who had died

SPANISH GENE FLOW INTO TLAXCALA
Published accounts of the number of Spaniards who entered TIaxcala in Conquest times have been quite vague. Gibson (1967, p. 79), for example, reports a "steady infiltration of Spanish colonists into TIaxcala in the late sixteenth century." Other literary references are similarly imprecise in the enumeration of Spanish soldiers and administrators. However, documents from the TIaxcala Archives contained estimates of the number of Spaniards in residence for three dates in the three main administrative centers of the state. These are summarized in Table 3.
The maximum number of Spaniardswho brought families with them into TIaxcala was approximately 400, and,at any given time during the colonial period, as many as 200 transient Spaniards were in the state, concentrated mainly in the cities which housed the administration. 1750 marks the final date of the entrance of Spanish settlers and the closure of the state to gene flow from outside Mexico (Nutini, ms.).

DISCUSSION
The present findings may be theoretically important for the analysis of the microevolution of Tlaxcalan populations. In several respects, the invasion of the Spanish into TIaxcala is one historical event with far-reaching demographic, genetic, and evolutionary consequences.
The most striking feature of thehis-

torically reconstructed populations of the state of Tlaxcala and the village San Bernardino Contla is the "bottleneck" in population size after 1519, a result of the rapid decline to one-third of the previous population level of the state by the end of the sixteenth century. The devastating epidemic diseases which occurred immediately following the first contact with Spaniards and the large-scale emigrations of Tlaxcalans in 1519 and 1591 sharply reduced the effective breeding population. Roberts (1968) and Gajdusek (1964) have suggested that such demographic conditions are favorable for the disruptive action of genetic drift. Two factors, however, may have minimized the chances of drift: (a) the population of the state was still 100,000 at its lowest point; and (b) gene flow into Tlaxcala continued throughout the depopulation period. Lasker (1952, 1960) has pointed out that gene flow and admixture may tend to counteract the random effects of drift.
The opportunity for rapid evolutionary change by natural selection might also have been enhanced in Tlaxcala in colonial times. If certain genotypes were more resistant than others to the epidemic diseases, the likelihood of differential survival and reproduction would have been suddenly increased. Reconstruction of the fertility rates from census records for 1786 and 1839 indicate that achieved reproduction and variance in offspring number were lower in those two samples in comparison with the living Indian and Mestizo populations of 1969. Sterility rates for females who had completed their fertile periods were higher in the 1786 and 1839 San Bernardino Contla populations than in the communities examined in 1969. Population structure for each of these three different samples appears similar, however; in each case the broad-based pyramid may reflect the continuous operation of natural selection

through differential mortality. Infectious diseases have historically constituted a prominent selective force among Tlaxcalan populations (Cockburn and Crawford, ms.). Pneumonia and gastroenteritis were discovered to be the most frequent causes of death in the recent Indian and Mestizo populations, especially in the younger age groups (Halberstein and Crawford, 1972). Thus, the opportunity for selection through disease vectors has persisted in Tlaxcala to the present.
The present data contain several implications that may elucidate the process of genetic admixture between Spaniards and Tlaxcalan Indians. In comparison to the total population of the state, relatively few Spaniards actually entered and remained permanently. Throughout the colonial period most of the Spanish immigrants, especially those who brought families and established residence, were localized in certain towns. It is known that many transient soldiers and officials filtered in and out of Tlaxcala at least until 1750. Considering the small number of administrators, their genetic contribution to subsequent Tlaxcalan populations is disproportionately large. Crawford and his associates (1972) have employed five statistical approaches in order to estimate the amount of admixture between Spaniards and Indians in Tlaxcala: least squares; multiple regression analysis; a summation of Bernstein's M, weighted by variance; the methods of Roberts and Hiorns (1965); and two tests of maximum likelihood, one based on alleleic frequencies and the other on phenotypic frequencies. The authors have found that more than 30% of the genes in the present Mestizo gene pool of the city of Tlaxcala may be of Spanish origin. This estimate is quite high, and it may be the result of several interrelated demographic circumstances: (a) the rapid depopulation of the state was coupled with

Vol. 20, No. 1 Historical-Demographic Analysis of Tlaxcala

the extensive segregation of "Spanish" genes; (b) the city of Tlaxcala was established by Spaniards as an administrative capital, and thus the founding proportion of "Spanish" genes was probably greater there than in other regions of the state; (c) the settlement patterns of the Spaniards were highly centralized; and (d) Spanish contact with the city of Tlaxcala endured for some 250 years.
CONCLUSION
Through the use of cultural materials, religious sources, and historical vital statistics, the demographic dynamics of Tlaxcala, Mexico from 1519 to 1970 are reconstructed and applied to biologically derived models of hybridization between Spanish and Indian populations. The Spanish occupation of Tlaxcala in 1519 resulted in pronounced effects upon the demography and evolution of Indian populations in the state. As the work of Arends et al. (1967), Harvey (1967), Neel and Salzano (1967), and Roberts (1967, 1971) has shown, historical

events may profoundly alter the demo-
graphic structure of a population, and
sixteenth-century Tlaxcala may be seen
as a particularly instructive example. The
microevolution of the TIaxcalan gene pool
was apparently influenced by substantial
demographic changes, the introduction of
new selective forces, directed migrations,
and the widespread admixture of "Spanish"
genes. This study offers the possibility of
assessing the historical effects of fertility,
mortality, and gene flow upon the micro-
evolution of a mixed population.
