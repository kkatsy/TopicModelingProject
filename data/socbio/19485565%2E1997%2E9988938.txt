ABSTRACT: The Vietnam 1988 survey established the first national estimates for reproductive preferences and behavior. It created a unique baseline for levels and differentials, both for the marked differences between North and South, and for various social and demographic categories. It also provided the first national data for program guidance, including information on unmet need. Unmet need for contraception has been extensively documented for much of the developing world, but its structure is not yet well understood. This study differentiates unmet-need couples by several demographic characteristics, by time since the last birth, and by features identified through a computer search program. Past investigations have emphasized the per cent with unmet need within various population subgroups, but some of those subgroups are small, whereas the national family planning program must be oriented to subgroups with large absolute numbers of unmet need couples. Unmet-need couples are selective, whether by reference to the married population or by reference to other couples who also wish to avoid pregnancy but are using a method. Most unmet-need couples are younger than users, have fewer children and, especially, are closer to their last birth. Surprisingly, most have never used a contraceptive method before, even though Vietnam has had a vigorous family planning program and 49 per cent of all couples in the survey reported some experience with a modern contraceptive method. In terms of sheer numbers, those in need are distributed very widely throughout the country. The most disadvantaged segments of the population have both high percentages and large numbers in need, but the concentration of the national program upon a single contraceptive method restricts their options.

Contraceptive prevalence is now moderately high in Vietnam, but it is based heavily upon one method, the IUD. About one-third of all couples in three national surveys (1988, 1993, and 1994) were using the IUD, and about half had ever-used it. Only China (33 per cent), Egypt (30 per cent), and Cuba (33 per cent) approximate this level of current IUD use, and other methods play important roles in China and Cuba. Where one method is nearly the only option, many couples are necessarily non-users due to dislike of the method, unhappy experiences with its side effects, accidental pregnancies while using it, or limited access to it. This situation has made for substantial unmet need in the Vietnamese

population since many non-using couples still do not want a pregnancy,
The recent literature on unmet need expands the concept quite broadly, going beyond the basic definition of fecund cohabiting women not wanting a pregnancy who still use no protection. Definitional variations encompass unmarried women, dissatisfied users, those with other reproductive health needs, and those desiring abortion · (Dixon-Mueller and Germain, 1992). However, the bulk of the quantitative literature rests on survey data that pertain to the basic narrower definition, and that is what we necessarily use here, Even that definition can vary, as it has over the years in the work of Westoff and colleagues (Westoff and Ochoa, 1991a,

1991b; Westoff and Bankole, 1995). Also, the surveys themselves differ in what information they offer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In this paper we focus on unmet need as measured in the 1988 national Vietnam survey (NCPFP, 1990), which was based largely upon the DHS model and included 3,890 married or cohabiting women. The 1988 questionnaire includes most of the items used by DHS, but the precise definition of unmet need must be adjusted here due to some differences. In particular, the questionnaire did not differentiate between spacers and limiters, so unmet need here can refer to either. Survey details appear in Dang (1995) and in NCPFP (1990). Additional recent studies of Vietnamese family planning and fertility include Allman et al. (1991), Hieu et al. (1995), Knodel et al. (1995), Phai et al. (1996), and Vu and Hannenberg(1989).
Unmet need here is based on MWRA (married or cohabiting women aged 15--49) and includes women who want no more children soon or ever (not separated in the original question) but are not using any contraception. Infecund couples are excluded, defined as not pregnant, no birth in the last five years despite constant cohabitation and no contraceptive use in that period; or over age 35 with only 0-1 child and constant cohabitation; or no menstruation in the last three months not attributable to postpartum amenorrhea. The exclusion based on no birth in five years may err for those who ended pregnancies by abortion, but overall the rules remove women who use nothing because they know they are infecund.

Some pregnant women are added to the unmet-need group: all those who are at or above their desired family size, including the current pregnancy (the survey did not ask whether the pregnancy was unwanted or ill-timed). Also added are fecund non-users who said yes when asked if they would be unhappy to become pregnant within the next few weeks. Under these various inclusions and exclusions 29 per cent of MWRA have unmet need, and these women are the basis of what follows. The variations we tested on these definitions produce essentially the same patterns and conclusions.
Moreover, the chief interest here is in differentials rather than exact levels, and for that the above serves quite well. The latest fix on the level of unmet need, which also departs from the usual DHS definition, is in Table 10 of Phai et al. (1996); total need there ranges from 21 per cent of couples to 36 per cent, reflecting mainly the inclusion of traditional method users. The figures would be larger except for the exclusion of some pregnant or amenorrheic women who said their pregnancy or last birth was wanted at the time of pregnancy. Certainly some of those women do not want the next pregnancy soon or ever and should be listed with unmet need, especially as some will conceive earlier than they wish to. The usual DHS definition is also defective in this regard by referring to the past rather than the future.
RESULTS
WHO HAS UNMET NEED?
Unmet-need women are distributed broadly throughout the population, both

geographically and demographically. They are a diverse group, but certain characteristics usefully differentiate them. Here we stress the distinction between a subgroup of the unmet-need women themselves, versus a subgroup of the general population having a high per cent of its own members with unmet need. The first distributes only the unmet-need women; the second distinguishes population subgroups by the density of unmet need. National action programs must address the former, whereas the latter is of analytic interest.
Table 1 summarizes the patterns. The left column gives the distribution of the unmet-need women, and the right column gives the per cent of all MWRA having unmet need. The distribution shows where the unmet-need women are to be found in absolute terms, while the percentages discriminate among subgroups of all couples. The latter prevails in the literature, but the two can give quite different impressions, and the former is more useful for program purposes.
Number of living children.--Here we see how important it can be to look at both the distribution and the per cent (Figure 1). The two give quite contrary pictures. The distribution, on the left, is weighted toward smaller families, whereas the sharp rise in the per cent of women with need follows the reverse pattern. At the extreme, 55 per cent of those with 8+ children have need, but only 6 per cent of couples have that many children. The two patterns are opposite, and the action program must chiefly follow the left rather than the right one.
Age.--The age distribution of those with unmet need is broad from age 20 upward. Few are aged 15-19 because relatively few Vietnamese women are married then, and those who are married usually

want a child. The 45-49 group, at 14 per cent of the total, is larger than the two just below it; fecundity or coital frequency of the couple is diminished then and some women clearly do not want a pregnancy but are not using a method because they do not need to. (In numerous surveys the direct queries on fecundity are not successful in screening out all such couples, which helps explain why some of the unmet-need group say they do not intend to use contraception.)
The per cent of all couples with unmet need is even at about 30 per cent from ages 20 through 34 and is not much different through age 44. Thus, age does not discriminate well between those with and without unmet need. From the program's standpoint, however, nearly half of unmet-need women, in terms of sheer numbers, fall between ages 25 and 34.
The open birth interval.--The open interval distribution (time since last birth) for unmet-need women is marked by a heavy concentration of women with young infants (Figure 2). These women include amenorrheic women who do not wish another pregnancy soon, or ever, and have not yet obtained contraceptive assistance. Amenorrheic women are not exposed at the instant of the interview, but many soon will be, and the most fecund ones will conceive quickly after the first ovulation and return to the currently pregnant group with the high risk that the ensuing short birth interval carries for the infants. Breastfeeding is common in Vietnam, but exclusive breastfeeding for six months is another matter, and contraceptive assistance is needed if early conceptions and brief birth intervals are to be minimized.
Between a quarter and a half of unmetneed women were currently pregnant or amenorrheic in the analysis of 26 countries

by Westoff and Ochoa (1991a). Those proportions are high, and they occur under an unmet-need definition that is simply whether the woman indicated that the pregnancy was unintended, while not using a method. In fact there are additional women

as noted who, whatever their attitude toward the current or recent pregnancy, are certain that they do not want another.
The numbers of women in need decline sharply with the lengthening interval in Figure 2, as do the numbers of all

married women as they age. Both trends are quite basic to program planning.
The per cent in need also declines for longer intervals, although not as sharply as does the distribution of unmet need women. It is clear that the program will find the highest density, and numbers, of unmet-need women close to their last birth. Many of these are couples early in their childbearing careers, for whom spacing methods are appropriate. Others are at their last wanted birth and wish to terminate childbearing.

Education.--The distribution of unmetneed women by education is largely within Form 1-9 (primary education). However, this distribution also reflects that of the general population which has a high literacy level. The per cent in need is very high in the illiterate group, but only 9 per cent of unmet-need women are illiterate. The group of second importance, in the balance of numbers and per cents, is the "can read" group, which is sizable and also has a substantial per cent (38 per cent) in need.

Region and residence.--Unmet-need couples are spread geographically, about half in the North and half in the South, not too different from the distribution of the population. More live in the rural North than in the rural South. However, the per cent in need is highest in the rural South, where the national program is less inclusive. Even among contraceptive users in the rural South, more rely upon traditional methods than in the rural North.
Past use.--Notably, most women in need have never used contraception. That limited experience is another indication that the unmet-need group is composed disproportionately of couples relatively early in their childbearing years.
From this material, the general conclusion for the family planning program is that actions to provide services to those in need will find most interested women (couples) with smaller family sizes, close to a recent birth, and without experience with any modern contraceptive method. Although this is a select group, the national program must keep basic information messages in the air constantly to the general population, not only because couples often move slowly to decisions about family planning but also because they change statuses through time. Specific facts on methods and sources are required since young couples move promptly to their first births and many then wish to delay the next pregnancy. Some will be caught with unwanted conceptions, especially in rural areas, if information and services are not close at hand.
UNMET NEED WOMEN COMPARED TO
CONTRACEPTIVE USERS
Women without unmet need are chiefly of two types: those who are using a method, and those who are not doing so

because they actively want another child. The quite different character of the two groups appears in Figure 3, for number of living children. Nonusers (extreme right) mainly have either no child or only one, while users (middle) mainly have two or more. Unmet-need women (on left) are intermediate in family size; on average they have fewer children than users do but more than the non-users do.
A useful comparison is between unmet-need women and users. Both groups wish to avoid pregnancy, but one is acting on this wish and the other is not. The determinants of this difference are manifold, and we do not have all the data needed for a full exploration. Some determinants concern visits by fieldworkers, exposure to mass media, involvement in diffusion networks, and the family/living context of the woman, and we lack such information. Here we briefly compare the two groups on three demographic items (Table 2).
(a) Family size: The groups differ somewhat in their family sizes; almost no women in either group are childless, but users are somewhat concentrated at 2-4 children, while unmet-need women are more prominent at 1-3 and 6+ children. Probably the fact of contraceptive adoption has helped keep users out of the higher parity groups. Also, more of them may have relied on abortion or menstrual regulation. Both are widely available and widely used (Goodkind, 1994).
(b) Age: The two groups hardly differ in their age patterns, except that there are fewer users at ages 20-24 and more at ages 30-44.
(c) Open birth interval: The sharpest difference between the two groups is in their open birth intervals. Far more unmetneed women have a young child, and far

fewer have the youngest child at age two and above. Which comes first? Contraceptive use that extends the interval, or a recent birth that occasions a delay in obtaining contraception? The dynamics of the birth interval may determine part of unmet need, at least in Vietnam. Users and non-users have roughly similar ages and somewhat similar family sizes. Assuming some homogeneity in those respects, then many women with a recent birth have not yet gotten around to adopting contraception, or program staff have not yet contacted them. Some women feel safe due to amenorrhea, and many are not in touch with public services (and little else exists for the 80 per cent living in rural areas). Some have already become pregnant again, particularly those who have not maintained exclusive breastfeeding. An underlying dynamic then is partly one of timing: delay is natural, and it takes time to obtain an IUD, which is the chief method available. To the extent that this is true, a leading explanation of non-use among unmet-need women rests on the presence, or absence, of sympathetic and convenient contraceptive services in the period soon after childbirth.
PREDICTORS OF UNMET MEED
Another approach to these questions is possible through an exploratory computer search program, termed CHAID, for ChiSquared Automatic Interaction Detector (part of SPSS). Briefly, one chooses a dependent variable such as unmet need and enters a variety of determinants, or predictors, which are then examined to identify the most efficient one. The next best determinants are also given, to show whether the best one exceeds the others by a clear margin. The top two may be

very close and the second best may be more useful as a guide for program strategy. Selections of determinants, and of the best split within each determinant, are made by a chi-square routine.
Unmet need is 29 per cent for the entire sample (top of Figure 4), and the open interval is identified as the best determinant by a large margin over the others (not shown). A high 49 per cent appears for the shortest open interval group, falling regularly to 16 per cent for women who are 60-83 months past their last birth. It then rises to 23 per cent for women in the final group, probably reflecting their low risk of pregnancy and perception of no need for contraception.
Each open interval group now becomes a fresh exercise. The leftmost group is divided into those with 0-5 children, with 47 per cent in need, and those with 6+ children, with 71 per cent in need. (Again, this division and all others are specific to the open interval group involved.) Comparable divisions are made for the next two open interval groups. Interactions then appear. For the 60-83 months group, a breakout by age is most efficient, isolating the group at 40-44 with high unmet need, which no doubt reflects their subfecundity and lack of interest in contraception. For the open interval group at 84+ months, where the youngest child is over eight years old, education is the most efficient predictor. Even though it is less useful as a fieldworker guide, it is left in here for purposes of illustration. Exploratory work with the software showed the open interval and the number of children to be clearly superior to alternative variables. Moreover, they are convenient guides for field staff to identify couples with unmet need.
Further splits can be made to extend the tree in Figure 4, until one of the stopping

rules intervenes: either no split meets the 0.05 significance level used here, or the chosen number of levels is reached (two here), or the next candidate subgroup has less than 50 members.
Thus, the CHAID program is useful for exploratory work, and for quickly sorting out which determinants best differentiate between high and low values on the dependent variable. One can override its automatic choices and force splits by alternative variables, or one can use a preliminary run to suggest an alternative sequence of levels. We could, for example, force a first split on number of children and then examine open interval splits in the second level. Unlike multiple regression methods, CHAID is entirely flexible for highlighting interactions, and it does so for specific groups that can

guide fieldwork operations, as shown above. It should not however be used uncritically. It is important to give attention to the closeness of alternative predictors, especially in the sequences for the first and second levels.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
This paper is meant to help to clarify the structure of unmet need for family planning procedures in the Vietnamese population, and the following are the essential observations.
1.--In terms of sheer numbers, those in need are distributed very widely throughout the country, and widely by age. They are somewhat concentrated within smaller families, particularly those with no sons yet. The sharpest discrimination is by the

open birth interval: most of those in need are in the active childbearing stage, either pregnant or with a young infant.
2.--Statistics on unmet need should go beyond simple percentages in need among subgroups of couples. High percentages may give false signals since the subgroup in question may be quite small and constitute a tiny fraction of the population in question.
3.--The most disadvantaged segments of the population, however, have both high percentages and large numbers: the rural and agricultural groups, and especially those in the South. They, and the one-third of the population with little or no formal education, have little access to modern contraception except through the formal program, which however offers them chiefly only one method.
4.--Some of the unmet need group are not really in need: those older couples with older children who know they are unlikely to conceive again and so use no method. Survey measures of infecundity sometimes fail to exclude these couples, many of whom help compose the group that does not intend to use.
5.--There is much evidence of a large market for increased contraceptive use. The following points argue for considerable latent interest: (1) Substantial proportions of couples have had more children than they desired. At ages above 30, from one in seven to nearly one in two couples have more children than desired. This has occurred even in the presence of extensive use of abortion and menstrual regulation in the Vietnam system. (2) Some 1.2 million to 1.4 million procedures of abortion

or menstrual regulation have been occurring annually, or about 13 per cent of married women (Goodkind, 1994). This volume, cumulated over say three years, encompasses a remarkable share of reproductive age women, even after removal of duplications.
6.--Contraception is already used by nearly 70 per cent of couples with two children and at least one son, and by 60-65 per cent of all married women aged 30--44--clear evidence of the extensive public awareness and knowledge levels already present. Important barriers to enlarged contraceptive use and to the reduction of unmet need clearly rest on the supply side, and these are more amenable to implementation than are additional efforts to increase demand beyond the vigorous ones already operating.
7.--Unmet need, by a range of definitions, exists among one-sixth to over onefourth of couples, without counting categories such as traditional-method users, dissatisfied users, abortion cases, or unmarrieds. Such enlargements add to the absolute numbers considered to be in need, although if the unmarrieds, for example, enter both numerator and denominator, they probably reduce the percentage in need. All those groups would be helped by program improvements, including especially a wider method mix.
