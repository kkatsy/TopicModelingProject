A New Name Society for the Study of Social Biology
(formerly The American Eugenics Society) Four years ago the name of this journal was changed because the word eugenics had a meaning too narrow to characterize the contents of the journal. The American Eugenics Society, as sponsor of the journal, elected at that time to retain its old name for historical reasons and because eugenics remained the ultimate focus of interest. As proximate goals became more diverse and more clearly perceived, dissatisfaction with the old name increased. The change might have occurred earlier if selection of a new name had been easy. The final choice, Society for the Study of Social Biology, was prompted mainly by the new name of the journal, which has been well received. The change of name of the Society does not coincide with any change of its interests or policies. Such a change was marked rather by the founding of this journal twenty years ago. The common interests that have long united the membership, and to which their scientific disciplines are relevant, are the trends of human evolution and the biological, medical, and social forces that determine these trends.
