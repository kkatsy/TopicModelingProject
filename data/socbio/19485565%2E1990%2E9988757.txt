ABSTRACT: Data from the 1981-82 Nigeria Fertility Survey (NFS) are used to identify the key proximate determinants of fertility in Nigeria. The patterns of their individual and collective effects are analyzed in a search for possible sources of fertility change. Exposure to the risk of childbearing through first marriage is found to be the most important proximate determinant of Nigerian fertility. Subsequent to marriage, fertility is determined mainly by breastfeeding and postpartum sexual abstinence. Where fertility shows significant socioeconomic variations, there are equally identifiable patterns of the impact of the proximate determinants which explain these differentials to a large extent. On a national scale, the observed patterns of the impact of the measured proximate determinants do not appear to suggest that Nigerian fertility is soon to experience a large decline.

With an estimated population of about 110 million in 1990, Nigeria is by far the most populous country in Africa. The national population is highly differentiated with respect to geographical distribution, sociocultural characteristics, and economic development. There are 21 states in the country which fall into four geographical regions: NorthEast, North-West, South-East, and South-West. These regions reflect, though imperfectly, broad sociocultural, economic, and demographic characteristics. The two southern regions are mainly Christian, more educated, more Westernized, and more economically advanced than the two predominantly Muslim northern regions. About 80 per cent of the population lives in rural areas. Although no exact figure is available, it is generally believed that the national population is roughly equally distributed between the North and the South and is growing at a rate of around 3.5 per cent per annum. The current national total fertility rate is 6.4.

The proximate determinants of fertility which are relevant to this analysis include the proportion of women ever married, the proportion of women currently married, postpartum amenorrhoea, postpartum sexual abstinence, lactational infecundity, contraception, induced and spontaneous abortions, natural and pathological sterility, and frequency of intercourse. However, because of data limitations, not all of these variables are measured for their direct effects on fertility.
Data from the Nigeria Fertility Survey (NFS) (NFS Report, Vol. 1, 1984) show that marriage is still early and universal in Nigeria, and that once married, women spend only a small proportion of time outside marriage. On the average, Nigerian women are amenorrhoeic for 10.4 months, abstain for 14.1 months, and breastfeed for 16.3 months in the last closed birth interval. Current use rate of modern contraception among fecund, non-pregnant married women is just 6.2 per cent.

The background variables which are analyzed with the proximate determinants are age of the respondent, female and husband education, and region and type of place of current residence. The choice of these variables is based on their importance for fertility levels and on availability in the NFS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

FERTILITY EXPOSURE ANALYSIS
Fertility Exposure Analysis (FEA) decomposes the overall fertility of an individual woman into its proximate determinants or their quantifiable surrogates within a defined time interval. A woman is assigned a given state or states each month in the interval under observation using a defined hierarchy among the states. In a given interval, a woman could be pregnant (p), never married (m), not in union (u), infecund following a confinement (/), breastfeeding a baby (/), using contraception (c), or exposed to the risk of having a pregnancy (r). The contribution of a particular state for each woman in the reference period is derived by dividing the sum of the proportion of the time interval spent in each state by the length of the reference period. The additive form of the model is,

F = d(p)/(d(p)

d(r)) (1)

where F = potential fertility and p,i,r, m,u,c and / are as defined above. d(p)l (d(p) + d(i) + d(r) = observed fertility, net of the reducing effects of the proximate determinants or states m,u,c and /; d(m), d(c) and d(l) are the reductions due to the individual states. The model can also be stated in a multiplicative form as,

F = d(p)/(d(p) + d(i) + d(r)) . C(m)C(u/m)C(c/mu)C(l/muc); (2)

C(m) = reducing effect of marriage, C(ulm) -- reducing effect of union in-
stability, C(clmu) = reducing effect of contra-
ception, and, C(ilmuc) = reducing effect of breast
feeding on fertility.

The observed fertility (f) for each individual is,

(12/9).d(p)

(3)

where d(p) is the proportion of time spent pregnant in the observation interval. The potential fertility (F), or fertility net the effects of the proximate determinants, is calculated as the ratio of the time spent pregnant to the time spent unprotected by any of the identified determinants; thus,

F= 12/9(d(p)/d(p)

. (4)

For regression analysis, the mean "f's and "F's in (3) and (4) for the reproductive ages (15-49) are multiplied by the length of the reproductive age range to produce an approximate measure of the observed and potential total fertility rates.
Some adaptations of FEA are made in the allocation of protective probabilities due to breastfeeding and contraception. Postpartum non-susceptible period is broken into its lactational and non-lactational components and the impact of postpartum sexual abstinence on fertility is measured separately. It isconsidered that what might have been recorded as herbs and "others" in the Nigerian Fertility Survey could have included a variety of mildly effective folk methods such as concoctions prepared by local medicine men (see Bradley and Gille, 1981); hence the generous

allocation of 0.3 to each as their probable degree of protection from contraception (Table 1).
There are not enough data of sufficient quality in the NFS with which to estimate internally the probability of protection bymethod accurately. Apart from sterilization and IUD's whose efficacies are not dependent on accurate application on the part of the user, it is possible that theprobabilities in Table 1 overstated protection from the risk of pregnancy due to contraception among Nigerian women. For lack ofdetailed information on contraceptive use on a monthly basis, it is assumed that current users used the current method throughout the open interval.
The proportion of women who never breastfed in theNFS data is toosmall to allow estimates of protection probabilities dueto breastfeeding to be made endogenously with the examination ofthe relationship between the duration of postpartum amenorrhoea and breast-

feeding duration. A schedule produced with Egyptian data (Nawar and Hobcraft, 1986) is adjusted upwards at very long durations for Nigeria based onthe comparison of breastfeeding habits in the two countries, andfollowing suggestions that fertility-inhibiting effects of breastfeeding beyond menstruation might have been underestimated in past studies (Guz and Hobcraft, 1990). A woman is assumed to be sterile if she was fully exposed to the risk of conception inthethree years ofobservation but had no pregnancy. An elaborate stratification which measures fecundity by the fertility performance of a woman within a given interval in thepast is not carried out because it has been found to make only small differences in results.
Reported pregnancies in the selected interval are used to estimate fertility. This is likely to underestimate fertility because pregnancies, especially at very early durations, are often underreported in retrospective surveys. Since pregnancies are converted into births before their outcomes areknown, this is likely to overstate fertility because not all pregnancies will end in live births. Hence, the possible downward bias introduced by any omission of pregnancies is likely to be compensated for by the absence of adjustment for pregnancy wastage.
Using the additive model of FEA, Equation (1) is restated with a separate effect of post partum abstinence as,

F = d(p)/(d(p)

d(r)) (5)

where d(a) = the reduction in fertility due to post partum abstinence. All abstinence durations for thethree mostrecent births which fall within theobservation window areincluded intheanalysis. For the women who were still abstaining

in each category are unadjusted and are more likely to have been affected by confounding factors than the values in Table 5, and thus should be interpreted with some caution.
In Table 5, estimates of marital fertility show no deviation from an expected age-pattern. The net effect of type of place of residence on marital fertility is small, although rural level is higher. No strong dampening effect of education on fertility is observed below secondary schooling. As would be expected, marital fertility is lowest for women with secondary or higher education. There is only a slight difference between the marital fertility for women whose husbands have either primary education only and secondary or higher education. The interesting point here is that the two high husband-education categories (primary, sec. +) show levels of marital fertility which suggest that husband's education may not necessarily be acting in the same direction as a woman's own education does on fertility.

A potential total fertility rate of 14.23 estimated for Nigeria appears to be within a reasonable range although it is 1.08 TFR lower than the value which is usually assumed in the Bongaarts' model (see Bongaarts, 1978; Bongaarts and Potter, 1983). In other applications of FEA, varied levels of potential TFR's have been estimated which generally tend to be lower than Bongaarts' model value of 15.3. A value of 15.1 was estimated for the Dominican Republic (Hobcraft and Little, 1984), 14.3 for the Republic of Korea (Little and Hobcraft, 1984), 12.6 for Egypt (Nawar and Hobcraft, 1983), and 15.3 and 11.7 for Kenya and Sudan respectively (Chimere-Dan, 1989).
Variations in potential fertility (Table 3) should be small in the absence of errors and if all proximate determinants were included in the model. With the exception of the South-East, regional variations in potential fertility are not large. It is not surprising that potential fertility is slightly lower in the urban ar-

eas. This could be reflecting the omission of some relevant proximate determinants. One of such is reduced coital frequency arising from spousal separation due to working or schooling patterns of couples. Another reason for the observed lower urban potential fertility might lie in possible omission of induced abortion, the practice of which is likely to be more widespread in the urban areas.
FERTILITY REDUCTION BY THE
PROXIMATE DETERMINANTS
The data in the five central columns of Table 2 show the estimated percentage reduction of potential age-specific and total fertility rates by each proximate determinant. In total, fertility in Nigeria is reduced by 58.5 per cent from its potential level by the proximate factors which are measured in the present analysis. Exposure reduction due to being outside marriage is the single most important determinant of fertility level. Never-married state accounts for as much as a quarter of all reduction in fertility for all women.
Breastfeeding is the second most important proximate determinant, accounting for a 15.8 per cent reduction in fertility while postpartum sexual abstinence ranks third in the major fertility determinants with a 13.3 per cent reduction in fertility. Marital instability and contraception are of a relatively minor consequence for fertility level once the impacts of marriage, breastfeeding, and abstinence have been assessed.
The contribution of contraception to fertility reduction shows some slight rise at old age. This suggests that at these advanced ages, many women who use contraception might be doing so in order to stop, rather than to space childbearing. A cultural impetus for such a practice

may be the norm in most Nigerian communities which expects women who have reached particular social ages (e.g., grandmothers) to stop childbearing.
At the peak and other important childbearing age groups, breastfeeding and postpartum sexual abstinence show quite strong effects. No large differentials are observed in the age pattern of marital fertility reduction due to these two proximate determinants until the last childbearing age groups.
Not being married and contraception reduce fertility more in the South than in the North of Nigeria while breastfeeding reduces fertility more in the North than in the South. There is a fairly uniform pattern of fertility reduction due to postpartum sexual abstinence in all regions except in the South-East where a relatively lower impact is observed. The dampening impact of marital instability is greater in the South-East region.
The most obvious rural-urban differentials in fertility reduction by the proximate determinants are for marriage and abstinence effects, although contraception shows significantly more fertilityreducing impacts in the urban areas.
The negative effect on fertility of being unmarried increases with educational achievement, as would be expected. Marriage disruption contributes most to fertility reduction among the uneducated women. Contraception shows a comparatively strong fertilityreducing effect among the most educated group. Beyond Koranic level of education, the power of breastfeeding to reduce fertility is inversely related to educational status of women. A similar inverse relationship is observed between the fertility-reducing effects of postpartum sexual abstinence and formal education.

Estimates of the mean waiting times to conceive and the proportion sterile for women aged 20-29 are shown in Table 3 by background characteristics. Women in the 20-24 and 25-29 age groups wait on the average for just over a year and 14.5 months, respectively, to conceive. It is noticed that Northern fecund women wait longer to conceive than their counterparts in the South. There is also a tendency for the more educated women to conceive quicker.
It should be recalled that sterility is here operationally defined as absence of a conception for any woman who was fully exposed to the risk of a pregnancy throughout the three-year interval. Although this length of time is about ideal, some women might go on to conceive after three years. Therefore, the sterility results in Table 4 do not show, with absolute certainty, the levels and patterns of primary sterility in Nigeria. The picture which they present, however, is not

misleading, especially when viewed together with the evidence on sterility from other sources (e.g., Udjo, 1987). There are more sterile women in the Northern regions than in the Southern regions, more in rural than urban areas, and higher educational achievement is associated with low level of sterility.
DISCUSSION
With the data in Table 5, it is easier to see the proximate causes of socioeconomic and age variations in fertility. At the peak of the childbearing age group (24-29), abstinence and breastfeeding have strong negative impacts on fertility (15.1 and 21.5 per cent, respectively), while contraception has the least negative impact (0.3 per cent). Should the durations of breastfeeding and abstinence shorten, however slightly, the fertility reaction is most likely to be a rise.

dampening effect on fertility, and it appears that women in this region are increasingly substituting traditional norms of childbearing with the use of modern contraception. In the South-West, both breastfeeding and abstinence will show relatively strong impact on marital fertility.
It is clearer from these results why small differentials exist between rural and urban marital fertility in Nigeria. In the urban area, fertility would tend to rise due to relatively weak impacts of breastfeeding and abstinence. On the other hand, marital disruption and contraception appear to depress fertility in the urban areas. The exact opposite of this pattern is observed for the rural areas: Breastfeeding and abstinence depress fertility more, while the negative impacts of marital disruption and contraception are small. These patterns would have some cancelling effects on the overall rural and urban fertility differentials in Nigeria. However, it seems that the depressing effects on urban fertility are weaker on balance, hence the tendency for it to rise and produce the current pattern of near convergence with rural fertility.
The erosion of traditional norms of childbearing in Nigeria is apparent in the pattern of the proximate determinants among the educational categories. The impact of postpartum abstinence shows an inverse relationship with formal (i.e., excepting Koranic) education. Breastfeeding and contraceptive impacts on fertility are also inversely related to formal education. As would be expected, the reducing effects of contraception show a positive relationship with husband education. Abstinence, breastfeeding, and marital instability show an expected inverse relationship with husband education, although with

less consistency than is observed for the respondent's own education.
The results of the present analysis confirm the dominant impacts of breastfeeding and postpartum sexual abstinence on Nigerian marital fertility as can be seen in Table 6. The size of their individual impacts on fertility suggest that breastfeeding and abstinence might have had roughly equal depressing effects on fertility in the past. In recent times, the practice of long durations of breastfeeding and postpartum sexual abstinence have come under increasing pressures to adapt to modernization. Significant reduction in the duration of either or both of these proximate determinants will result in fertility rises unless contraceptive use prevails at an equal or higher degree.

CONCLUSION
It seems that, in the near future, the level and trend of fertility in Nigeria will be largely determined by the trend in age at entry into first marriage, duration of breastfeeding, and postpartum sexual abstinence. Familiar and expected patterns of variations are observed in the impact of some background variables on fertility via these proximate determi-

nants. Ineffect, a decline innational fertility, when it sets in, islikely to bea reaction of the proximate determinants to the impacts ofthe more remote or modernization variables.
Considered alongside the current knowledge about other aspects of fertility-related behavior inNigeria,the available data do not suggest aclear tendency toward fertility decline. Although there are some indications ofa rising age at first marriage, the evidence is still confined toa small subgroup ofthe population, mainly in the South. Changes identified for breastfeeding and postpartum sexual abstinence appear to be in favor of a slightly rising fertility, atleastin

the short run. Presently, contraception is not apowerful proximate determinant of fertility in Nigeria. This scenario promises anything but an imminent substantial national fertility decline. To offset the observed potential for rises in fertility, and to go on to initiate a nationwide large decline infertility require, indeed a revolution in the practice ofmodern contraception by Nigerian couples.
