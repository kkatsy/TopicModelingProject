Philippine Population Journal Inaugurated

The Philippine PopulationJournal, inaugurated in March, 1985, is being published quarterly by the Commission on Population and the University of the Philippines Demographic Research and Development Foundation, Inc. The Journal seeks to further the discussion, advancement, and dissemination of population and population-related knowledge in the Philippines.
The Preface to Volume 1, No. 1 (March, 1985) states: "The Journal seeks to provide a regular forum for an examination of the knowledge base that will be of technical and practical value toward an informed choice among alternatives both at the individual and policy levels insofar as population planning decisions are concerned. A more comprehensive approach will be attempted toward this goal by broadening the focus of population studies in the Philippines in three ways: (1) to recognize the im-

portant role played by each of the three processes of population change, namely: fertility, mortality, and migration; (2) to consider the implications of such processes on policies and programs and vice versa; and (3) to give due recognition to the valuable contributions of various disciplines to a better understanding of the population processes. The cross-fertilization of the disciplines in the analysis of population and population-related variables by competent scholars, we believe, will hasten the solution of innumerable problems involved in the phenomenon of population change."
