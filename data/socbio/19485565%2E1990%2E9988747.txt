ABSTRACT:This paper tests, within the framework of LISREL, the causal structures of fertility using data from the 1973-74 Growth of Alberta Family Study (GAFS) of women aged 18-44 who are currently married or living common-law. Differential fertility among two groups of women classified by nativity also are examined. The women's background characteristics (e.g., age, religiosity, and education) are viewed as exogenous variables. The endogenous variables are familism and expected family size; familism is designated as an intermediate variable in the model, linking demographic and socioeconomic (including cultural) factors to fertility. The results indicate that familism acts as an important variable explaining fertility, particularly, among foreign-bom women. The study confirms and extends earlier research findings that religiosity and education influence couples' fertility, the former positively and the latter negatively.

been studied as being dependent on such structural variables as social class (Kunz, 1965), religious affiliation (Freedman et al., 1961), and race and residential background (Westoff et al., 1961). Although these traditional variables predicted fertility reasonably well at one time, some researchers argue that the variables have lost most of their explanatory power (Westoff and Westoff, 1971; Turchi, 1975).

Several researchers have argued that while the structural approach is insufficient to understand the wide variations that exist between attitude and action within broad social categories, the micro approach also is inadequate because it does not take into account the role of structural factors in the formation of attitude and action. An alternative approach to the study of fertility therefore has emerged, one which attempts to in-

corporate structural variables into the micro approach (see Mitchell and Pratto, 1977).
The purpose of this paper is to explain fertility from this perspective. The study tests a causal model which describes the influence of structural factors (e.g., religiosity and education) on such micro variables as familism, and the relative total effects of all those factors on fertility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Scanzoni (1975) argued that women who define themselves through traditional female roles marry earlier, are less likely to be employed full-time or to use effective contraception, and are expected to bear more children than women with less familial orientation. He claimed that "the greater the individualism, the less the familism" (p. 187). Bell's (1968) argument is that parents who hold high pro-family values expend material and emotional resources on their children, while those holding anti-family values expend such resources to support their life-styles. This suggests that familistic couples are more likely to avoid life-styles predominated by careerism and consumerism and are more likely to have large families.
The research reported here looked at whether familism has an impact on expected family size, using a model of fertility and familism developed and estimated using maximum likelihood (LISREL) techniques. Specifically, it tested the hypothesis that fertility expectations may be interpreted in terms of the inter-related operation of demographic and socioeconomic factors (including cultural), and familistic orientation.
In examining familism's effects on

fertility1, the possibility of interactions by nativity was also considered. Familyrelated norms differ by nativity. Because nativity is not a unidimensional concept, but multidimensional, including values, norms, attitudes, and practices, the causal linkages between familism and fertility will be different for Canadian-born and foreign-born women.
HYPOTHESES
In this study, control variables are: age of wife (AGE), education of wife (EDU), religiosity of wife (REL), and house space (HSE). These are designated as exogenous variables in the model. These variables (with the exception of house space) constitute the key elements for the socioeconomic analysis for fertility. The economic framework for fertility analysis, for example, assumes that couples' background characteristics influence the demand for children (Becker, 1960; Namboodiri, 1972a, b). Namboodiri (1972a, b) noted that factors such as socioeconomic status and residential background are the important sociosituational factors relevant to fertility behavior of couples.
Wife's age (AGE) has been one of the most frequently used variables in studying the determinants of fertility (Namboodiri, 1974; Grindstaff, 1975). Namboodiri (1974) noted that wife's age (and her age at marriage) affects familysize intentions at all parities. Wife's age also appears to be related to familism.
1Some caution regarding a familism-fertility relationship is needed. Familism is influenced to some degree by the number of children a couple already has. This is especially the case when expected family size is equal to current family size. We cannot be sure of the direction of the potential bias whether we over- or underestimate familismfertility effects by the exclusion of the path from fertility to familism. Thus, readers should be aware of this limitation.

MEASURES OF THE DEPENDENT VARIABLES
In this study, familism was measured attitudinally. An index was constructed based on responses to questions asking respondents about their attitudes toward working mothers, happiness associated with children, women who stay at home as full-time mothers, and guilt associated with separation of mother and children. The index included the items listed below:
a. A pre-school child is likely to suffer if the mother works;
b. It is much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and the women takes care of their children;
c. Women are much happier if they stay at home and take care of their children; and
d. If anything serious happened to one of the children while the mother was working, she could never forgive herself.
The items were coded from one to five with one indicating strong disagree-

ment and five indicating strong agreement. As a first step in the computation of the index, a factor analysis of the items was performed. The second step was to compute the index by summing the items which loaded highly on a factor.4
A major problem associated with the measurement of fertility preferences or current fertility is that they do not necessarily measure the future childbearing ability of couples. Of course, there exists no way of knowing what completed family size ultimately will be since most of the women are still in their childbearing ages. Number of children ever-born and current family size, however, are strongly affected by age and marriage duration or by a woman's stage in the life-cycle (Smith, 1981). In contrast, expected family size is a measure which ad-
4The factor loadings associated with the items are 0.721, 0.797, 0.719, and 0.639. For a discussion of the computation of scales using factor loadings of Likert-type attitude items, see Smith-Lovin and Tickamyer(1978).

justs for life-cycle differences. The measure of expected family size is the sum of the number of children ever born to the mother (and still living at the time of the survey, regardless of whether or not they reside with their mother), plus expected future births. When there is indication that the respondent or her husband cannot have more children, expected family size is current family size.
DATA

The model estimated in the present study does not include multiple indicators for its factors. When one indicator variable is used for a given factor, it is almost impossible to estimate meaningful error variances (Ladewig and McGee, 1986). Therefore, error variance estimates were constrained to specific values (1-aSD2) as recommended by Joreskog and Sorbom (1982), to provide an approximation of the amount of 'error in that measure.

The data used in this study are obtained from a fertility survey of 1,045 women between the ages of 18 to 54, regardless of marital status, in Edmonton, Alberta during the winter of 1973-74. The survey, called the Growth of Alberta Families Study (GAFS), was the third major fertility survey to be conducted in Canada, and the first in Western Canada. The questionnaire used was a detailed base-line fertility schedule derived from the standard internationally used instrument (The Population Council, 1970) in order to ensure comparability with previous surveys conducted in the population field (see Krishnan and Krotki, 1976, for a comprehensive report of the GAFS).
The sample drawn for the present study was limited to women in the age group 18-44 who at the time were married or living common-law. A total of 614 women met these criteria. Of these, 473 women were Canadian-born, and 141 women were foreign-born.
Models of familism and fertility which integrate the four variables described earlier were analyzed by means of the LISREL VI computer program (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1986). The use of structural equation models in demographic research is now commonplace and requires no elaboration here.

RESULTS
As shown in Table 1, Canadian-born women clearly differ from foreign-born women in the following respects:
(1) Canadian-born in this sample are, on the average, younger than the foreign-born by almost three years;
(2) Canadian-born, on the average, have lower levels of religiousparticipation than foreign-born, although the differentials are not substantial; and
(3) the two groups have, on average,the same expected family size (2.68 and 2.67 respectively for Canadian-born and foreign-born).
The variance of age for foreign-born is nearly two-thirds the variance of the native-born comparison group (not shown in the table). The variance in education for foreign-born is about double that for Canadian-born. These findings justify the need to consider different causal structures for the two groups.

P = 0.998; AFGI = 0.998 (A small
value of chi-square corresponding to ap
value close to 1.0 indicates that the
model fits the data well). Another way
of describing the fit is to note that the ex-
ogenous variables explain 21.4 per cent
of the variation in FAM and 9.7 per cent
of the variation in EFS. This means that
the model, although capturing some im-
portant aspects of the process of fertility
behavior, still overlooks numerous fac-
tors which may explain the process.
6The Lambdas associated with the endogenous variables for the Canadian-born Model are 2.535 and 1.358 and for the Foreign-born Model are 2.617 and 1.451 respectively for FAM and EFS. The Lambdas associated with the exogenous variables for the Canadian-born Model are 8.358, 2.057, 0.703, and 1.620 and for the Foreign-born Model are 7.906, 2.965, 0.800, and 1.557 respectively for AGE, EDU, REL, and HSE. The Theta Epsilons associated with the endogenous variables for the Canadian-born Model are 1.606 and 0.205 respectively for FAM and EFS. The corresponding figures for the Foreign-born Model are 1.712 and 0.234. The Theta Delta associated with the exogenous variables for the Canadian-born Model are 12.328,0.747, 0.087, and 0.291 respectively for AGE, EDU, REL, and HSE. The corresponding figures for the Foreign-born Model are 11.031, 1.551, 0.113, and 0.269.

The findings indicate that the two most important predictors of familism in Canadian-born women are education and religiosity (coefficients are --0.428 and 0.149, respectively). These findings suggest a tendency among highly educated women to be less familistic and highly religious women to be more familistic. With respect to the relationship between the endogenous variables of familism and expected family size, familism has a positive effect on expected family size (0.085). As Table 2 indicates, education is the most significant predictor of expected family size (-0.217) ; the higher the education, the fewer the number of children expected. House space has a positive effect on expected family size. The omission of nonrecursive relationships between house space and expected family size may have overor under-estimated the coefficient for the variable; however, the finding supports earlierfindingsby Krishnan (1988) in Canada.
The model in Figure 2 (foreign-born model) also provides a statistically perfect fit to the data: x2 = 0.05; d.f. = 1; P = 0.831; AGFI = 0.998. The exogenous variables explain 21.6 per cent of the variation in familism and 22.9 per cent of the variation in expected family size. The findings presented in Figure 2 and Table 2 (the lower portion) indicate that education is the only significant predictor of familism (-0.362). On the other hand, all the variables with the exception of wife's age have significant effects on expected family size, with education being the strongest (-0.289). The hypothesis that familism affects expected family size is well supported (0.144).
