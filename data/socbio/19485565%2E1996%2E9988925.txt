ABSTRACT: This paper employs data from a merged sample of the National Surveys of Family Growth to examine how female employment status conditions the relationship between education and wanted and unwanted births among African American and white women. A rationale is presented for why a minority group status hypothesis that posits lower fertility among more highly educated African American women as compared to similar white women might find support in the case of wanted births and among certain women, including earlier birth cohorts. Our results provide some evidence for these ideas as well as evidence for a social characteristics hypothesis that predicts convergence of childbearing with rising education. However, persistently higher levels of unwanted births among African American women of all educational levels suggest that the dynamics of racial fertility differences are more complex than either of the hypotheses imply.

Studies of differential fertility between African Americans and whites in the United States often focus on the relationship between female education and fertility. Investigations based upon both survey and census data consistently find a stronger inverse relationship between education and childbearing among African American than among white women (e.g., Bean and Wood, 1974; Farley and Allen, 1987; Johnson, 1979; Ritchey, 1975; St. John, 1982; St. John and Grasmick, 1985). As we elaborate below, the research literature suggests this relationship might take any of three forms, each of which corresponds to an alternative hypothesis about the social and economic processes giving rise to racial differentials in fertility by education. The purpose of the present paper is to examine whether the forms of the relationship depend on: (1) the kind of fertility being examined (i.e., wanted

or unwanted fertility); (2) employment status prior to the birth of their first child; and (3) female education measured early in the life course as opposed to after childbearing is completed.
THE EDUCATION AND FERTILITY RELATIONSHIP
Johnson (1979) has noted that a more negative education/fertility relationship among African Americans could in theory take any of three forms. One would involve a "crossover" pattern in the data. This form consists, ceteris paribus, both of lower African American than white fertility at high levels of education and of higher African American than white fertility at low levels of education. A second form involves lower African American than white fertility at high levels of education, but insignificant

fertility differences between the two groups at low levels of education, but insignificant fertility differences between the two groups at low levels of education. The former and the latter patterns respectively provide support for what Johnson (1979) has termed the "strong" and the "weak" versions
of the minority group status hypothesis. While acknowledging the possibility that other forces also operate to generate differential fertility, the hypothesis derives from the argument that highly educated minority women, in response to obstacles perceived to the realization of mobility aspirations, compensate by reducing childbearing even below the level of highly educated white women (Bean and Marcum, 1978; Goldscheider and Uhlenberg, 1969; Johnson, 1979).
The third form of the education/ fertility relationship involves higher African American than white fertility at low levels of education, but insignificant differences at high levels of education. In this case, which is the one most frequently observed empirically, it is generally argued that the pattern results from greater similarity in the social and economic situations of African Americans and whites at higher levels of education. However, researchers have differed concerning whether they have emphasized social or economic factors in this process. For example, Johnson (1979) argues that the pattern reflects more complete structural and cultural assimilation among African American women at higher as compared to lower levels of education. On the other hand, Bean, Swicegood, and Marcum (1985) suggest that it reflects increasingly similar levels of earnings and opportunity costs of childbearing

among highly educated African American and white women.
Because this form of the relationship involves fertility congruence only at higher levels of education, Johnson (1979) views it as providing support for a "weak" version of the social char-
acteristics hypothesis. In its "strong" version, this hypothesis predicts that fertility differences between African American and white women can be fully explained by differences in social, demographic, or economic factors known to influence fertility behavior (Bean and Marcum, 1978; Farley and Allen, 1987; Johnson, 1979). In Figure 1, we present graphic depictions of the education/fertility relationships corresponding to the "strong" and "weak" forms of both the social characteristics and the minority group status hypotheses.
One of the difficulties that has plagued attempts to test the minority group status and social characteristics hypotheses has been that measures of mobility aspirations and perceptions of their likelihood of frustration have never been available. Information has not been available either in data sets containing detailed information on fertility or in data including sufficient numbers of African Americans to permit reliable statistical estimates of fertility by educational level. Collecting new data on mobility aspirations by race for a nationally representative sample would be inordinately expensive. Therefore, before collecting such data, it is worthwhile first to examine existing data in order to see which of the various relationships between education and fertility predicted by the alternative hypotheses emerges from the analyses.

It is also worth investigating the conditionality of these relationships. Uncovering the nature of any conditional relationships, including those that might suggest the circumstances under which lower African American than white fertility occurs among women of higher levels of education could help clarify the circumstances under which the various mechanisms implied by the alternative hypotheses might be operating. With such considerations in mind, this paper seeks to investigate whether the pattern of African American/white fertility differences by education in the United States varies depending upon (1) the wanted or unwanted status of births, (2) female employment status prior to first birth, and (3) the time in the life course when education is measured.
RATIONALE
The nature and strength of the education/fertility relationship may vary depending on whether wanted or unwanted fertility is being examined. Researchers have consistently found that African American women exhibit higher levels of unwanted childbearing than white women regardless of educational level (e.g., Eckard, 1980; Ryder and Westoff, 1972; Udry and Bauman, 1974; Williams and Pratt, 1990). Studies comparing the cumulative fertility of African Americans and whites, however, have often found little difference in the total numbers of births occurring to African American and white women at higher levels of education (e.g., Johnson, 1979). This finding raises the possibility that more highly educated African American women might show lower levels of wanted

childbearing than more highly educated white women.
Comparisons of African Americans and whites with respect to wanted and unwanted births must be sensitive to the possibility that measures of these concepts may not indicate the same thing for the two racial groups. Part of the usefulness of the measures, however, is that variation in wanted and unwanted childbearing undoubtedly reflects the influence of both "demand" and "supply" factors (Bulatao and Lee, 1983). By demand factors we mean variables that influence the number of births women want to have. By supply factors we mean variables that influence the number of births independent of the number desired. An example of a demand factor is desired fertility, and an example of a supply factor is fecundity (others are marriage, frequency of coitus, nutrition, and breast feeding). It is difficult to ascertain that any factor is purely a demand or a supply factor, and thus it is difficult to say that any measure of fertility unambiguously reflects the "demand for births" and that any other measure unambiguously reflects the "supply for births."
Nonetheless, the number of wanted births as measured in the data sets examined here (see below) seems likely to correspond more closely to a measure of the "demand for births" than does the measure of the number of unwanted births. The number of unwanted births is more complex. While it undoubtedly reflects the influence of supply factors, it probably also reflects the strength of motivation to contracept (the "demandfor contraception"). More specifically, unwanted births reflect situations where supply exceeds

222

demand. In any case, it is not unreasonable to think that variation in unwanted fertility reflects the influence of supply of factors more so than does variation in wanted births.
Measures of wanted births have particular relevance for tests of hypotheses about racial differences in fertility which posit mechanisms involving demand-related as opposed to supplyrelated determinants of fertility. This would be the case, for example, with the minority group status hypothesis, which implies a demand-related mechanism of fertility reduction involving actions consciously undertaken in order to compensate for the perception of limited chances for mobility.
We also think female employment may condition the education/fertility relationship because of the different employment experiences of African American and white women. For example, levels of employment among African American women have historically exceeded those for white women (e.g., Bowen and Finegan, 1969; Herring and Wilson-Sadberry, 1993; Shapiro and Mott, 1979). Female employment has also constituted a more important means of achieving mobility among African Americans than among whites, as is evidenced by the larger fraction African American women contribute to family income (e.g., Angel and Tienda, 1982; Sweet, 1973). Moreover, results from the National Longitudinal Surveys indicate that African American women manifest a higher degree of work commitment than white women, regardless of family structure (e.g., Wallace, 1980). Whatever the reasons for the origin and persistence of these differences in em-

ployment patterns (see Herring and Wilson-Sadberry, 1993, for a discussion of economic versus preference reasons), they imply a greater normative commitment to work exists among African American as compared to white women. Interestingly, this finding parallels findings of less disagreement between African American husbands and wives compared with white couples about definitions of appropriate sex role behaviors, including whether or not the wife should work (Scanzoni, 1979, p. 226-232).
Further insight into the importance of African American female employment may be obtained by examining the percentage of African American men's earnings constituted by African American women's earnings. For example, in 1981 African American women with four years of college or more earned 82.3 per cent as much as similarly educated men, whereas comparable white women earned only 66.5 per cent as much as the white men (Mellor and Stamas, 1982). In the lowest educational category (8 years or less), African American women earned 71.1 per cent as much as African American men, whereas white women earned 63.8 per cent as much as white men. In short, the ratio of female-to-male income is higher among African Americans than among whites, and it is highest at higher levels of education.
The importance of these patterns for our purposes can be seen in one of the major theoretical bases for the relationship between female education and fertility. Childbearing has been hypothesized to decline with rising female education because the value of

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

women's time (whether measured in terms of wage rates or opportunity costs) is greater at higher levels of education (Bean and Swicegood, 1985; Mincer, 1963; Schultz, 1980). Among minority women, including African American women, the opportunity costs of childbearing are thought to increase disproportionately with rising education, thus accounting for the more inverse education/fertility relationship among African Americans.
To the extent that female employment plays a more critical role among African Americans in contributing to family economic well-being and to the achievement of mobility aspirations, working prior to the birth of the first child may be selective of those African American women with the highest social and economic mobility aspirations. For this reason, the kind of fertilityreducing, compensatory behavior predicted by the minority group status hypothesis may be most likely to manifest itself among women who work prior to the birth of the first child. On the other hand, it is possible to argue that African American women who are not working at the onset of childbearing have an even stronger motivation to have fewer children.
A neglected aspect of the minority group status hypothesis, but one that follows from its emphasis on mobility aspirations, is that social and economic mobility aspirations for children may play a role in generating African American/white fertility differences. The influence of this factor on fertility in general, of course, has been incorporated into theories of fertility behavior through the idea of child quality (Becker, 1981; Sanderson, 1976). The

notion is that couples with the highest aspirations may have the lowest fertility in order to maximize child quality. An important means of achieving high child quality is the investment of parental time in children, including the time that is associated with the mother's not working. Among highly educated African American women especially, not working may thus be selective to some degree of women with the greatest mobility aspirations (at least for their own children). In this case, reduced childbearing, other things being equal, might be most likely among such women.
Another factor that may be important that has been neglected in previous research is the acquisition of additional education later in the life course. Most studies have used years of completed education at the time of interview as the measure of female education. However, some women acquire additional education after marriage. Those who do may be especially disposed toward lower fertility in the first place, or lower fertility may make the acquisition of additional education after marriage easier. In either case, acquiring additional education may be associated with lower fertility, and this possibility may vary by race, given the greater importance of female employment for economic well-being in the African American family.
To the extent that these kinds of processes operate, we hypothesize that a racial "cross-over" pattern will be most apparent when education is measured near the end of the reproductive process. Because we include in the analyses only women who have finished their wanted childbearing (see

224

below), this hypothesis means education can be measured later in the life course as well as prior to childbearing. (We acknowledge here that childbearing is increasingly occurring outside of marriage.) In the case of female education measured at the time of first marriage, we would not expect the education/fertility relationship among African American women to be so strongly inverse, because the fertilityreducing effect of acquiring additional education (or the education-enhancing effect of having lower fertility) would not yet have had a chance to operate.
Finally, we also investigate the possibility that improved opportunities for African Americans in the 1970's and 1980's, perhaps reflecting declines in discrimination occurring as a result of the civil rights legislation of the 1960's (Harrison and Bennett, 1995), means that the predictions of the minority group status hypothesis may apply with greater force to earlier birth cohorts of women. That is to say, earlier birth cohorts of African American women may have been more subject to obstacles to the realization of mobility aspirations and may have been more likely to compensate by reducing their fertility downward relative to comparable whites than later cohorts which faced less discrimination.

in order to test for racial differences in fertility by educational level. We also need a data set containing the measurement of wanted and unwanted fertility. No single data source meets all of these requirements. Consequently, in order to conduct the analysis under these constraints, we pool data from the 1973, 1976, 1982, and 1988 National Surveys of Family Growth (hereafter NSFG).
The 1973 and 1976 NSFG cycles are national areal probability samples, each designed to be representative of women in the reproductive ages for the non-institutionalized population of the coterminous United States who were ever-married or were single with own children living with them. The 1973 NSFG consists of 9,797 women and the 1976 NSFG consists of 8,611 women. The 1982 and 1988 NSFG cycles have very similar sample designs except these later surveys did not exclude any women based on marital status. The 1982 NSFG contains 7,969 respondents and the 1988 NSFG contains 8,450 respondents.1 The National Center for Health Statistics over-sampled African American women in each survey.
The sample for our analysis is restricted to ever-married women. We concentrate on ever-married women in order to capture the largest possible

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our research objectives require a data set large enough to accommodate the detailed cross-classification of women by race, employment status, and education. As we explain in more detail below, we treat education categorically in order to allow for the possibility of non-linear relationships and

1Swicegood, Morgan and Rindfuss (1984) examined the implications of pooling multiple national fertility surveys, finding a high degree of consistency both in variable measurement and in estimated relationships between variables across surveys. These researchers concluded that it is appropriate to merge these types of survey data sets into a single data file for purposes of studying fertility (see Mosher and Bachrach, 1982;Teachman and Schollaert, 1989 for substantive research examples pooling various years of the NSFG). We use unweighted data throughout this analysis (see Teachman and Schollaert, 1989, p. 413, for a rationale for this strategy).

sample of African American and white women within the context of the idiosyncrasies of NSFG survey strategies. For example, the 1973 and 1976 NSFG cycles contained interviews of nevermarried women only if they had own children living with them, meaning that never-married women who had given their children up for adoption or sent them to live with relatives were not covered in the survey. Because racial differences in these propensities may exist, it seemed to us preferable to restrict the study sample to ever-married women. Also, never-married women (1982 and 1988 NSFG cycles) and single women with own children (1973 and 1976 NSFG cycles) were not asked key questions necessary for a test of our hypotheses.2 Because postmarried women may confront different employment constraints that might modify the manner in which employment status affects the education/ fertility relationship, we estimated statistical models both for ever-married and for currently-married women. The results were similar for each marital status sample; thus, we report only the results for the ever-married group.
Women who had at least one child were also selected for the sample. This selection criterion was necessary because several of the theoretically important variables reference the birth of the first child. We also selected only women who said they intended to have
2The fraction of live birth events missed from the pooled NSFG by not evaluating the fertility of never married women is 8.4 per cent. We acknowledge the importance of research aimed at understanding fertility occurring outside of legal marriages but constraints based on the wording of theoretically important variables (e.g., job before first marriage, age at marriage, education at first marriage) makes it unfeasible to examine the fertility of never married women in this study.

no more children (self-identified completed fertility), thus including in the sample only women who were at risk of having an unwanted birth.3 This selection is necessary in order to study the determinants of unwanted fertility (Ryder and Westoff 1972). For the purposes of this study, we also assumed, following Ryder and Westoff (1972), that women have wanted births before they have unwanted births. As a result, we selected only women with temporally consistent birth (pregnancy) histories. This is a relatively small number of events because in any given survey, approximately 3 to 4 per cent of the respondents indicated they had an unwanted birth before they had their last wanted birth. In sum, our subsample consists of ever-married African American and white women with consistent pregnancy histories who have had at least one birth and had completed their wanted childbearing.
Restricting the study sample to ever-married women who had at least one child and who report having completed their wanted childbearing raises obvious questions regarding the possibility of sample selection bias (Berk, 1983, p. 390). Because the study sample is significantly smaller than the maximum possible sample available from pooling all four surveys (13,738
3The "wantedness" of each birth is determined by reference to each pregnancy interval. Respondents are asked a series of questions about the intentions, expectations, and plans regarding their pregnancies. From this, we are able to establish whether a given live birth was wanted or unwanted at conception. We recognize that the wantedness of a given pregnancy does not mean that a woman wants or does not want a given child. In addition, other researchers have disaggregated and have used categories such as "intended" and "wanted" (e.g., Williams and Pratt, 1990). We do not make that distinction here.

respondents versus 34,827 respondents, respectively), we took several steps to be sure that this selection did not bias our results. Three preliminary stages of analysis for selection bias were undertaken, including (1) a comparison of the number of births for ever-married women who had completed their fertility to the number of births for ever-married women who had not completed their fertility; (2) the estimation of separate regression models for ever-married women who had completed their fertility and for a larger sample including women regardless of their fertility completion status; and (3) the estimation of a set of selection models, using Berk's (1983) techniques. We discuss the findings of each step below.
First, note that the variables that have the largest effect on the reduction in sample size are future birth intentions and having at least one child (parity). The parity restriction does not affect the number of live birth events captured in this analysis. Note also that our study sample captures approximately 39 per cent of all women who might have been in our sample from the pooled data sets (see above). However, when we compare the number of births to ever-married women who self-report that they have completed their childbearing to a similar sample of women for whom self-reported completion of their childbearing was not a selection criteria, we find that we have captured in our sample 77.1 per cent of all possible birth events. Thus, if the issue is framed in terms of high events in the sample instead of number of women, the chance for bias is reduced.
Second, we estimated similar models for ever-married women who had

completed their childbearing and for ever-married women without the completion criteria (same two comparison groups from Step 1). Our strategy was to compare patterns of racial differences in wanted and unwanted fertility by education level. The results (not reported here but available from the authors) show a very similar set of outcomes, and indeed, the pattern of fewer African American wanted births as education increases is even stronger than that reported below. However, we report the results from the more restricted sample because this allows us to include more of the relevant control variables and follows more directly from our theoretical arguments.
Third, following the logic of Berk (1983, p. 394) and Jensen (1985), we evaluated the potential impact of selectivity with a series of regression models in a two-stage process (one set of selection models and one set of substantive models). In the first stage, we estimated logistic regression models designed to predict the probability of sample selection. We assumed for this analysis that the important characteristics for predicting whether a woman had at least one child and reported having completed her childbearing (in sample) versus whether she was childless or had not completed her childbearing (out of sample) was related to her occupational status (professional occupation or not), age, race, and marital disruption experience.
After estimating these models, we saved the predicted probabilities of sample inclusion for use as a covariate (a type of instrumental variable) in the second stage of the analysis for sample selectivity bias. In the second stage, we estimate a series of substantive OLS

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

regression models that include the original variables as discussed in the text and shown in Table 2 plus an additional instrumental variable that estimates each woman's probability of selection into the sample. Although the "hazard rate" variable was statistically significant in some cases, we present the results of the substantive OLS regression analysis because a comparison of the results from each method showed the central theoretical interpretations to be the same. In sum, we believe that the results reported herein are robust and are not substantially impacted by our sample selection criteria.
We divided the sample into two segments--women working prior to the birth of their first child and women not working before this event.4 We also examine two measures of education-- years of schooling completed at the time of first marriage and years of schooling completed at the time of interview. Hence, we examine the estimated effects of the education variables measured at two points in the life course on levels of wanted and unwanted fertility for women who worked and did not work early in the life course (prior to the birth of their first child). As noted above, the total sample contains 13,738 ever-married women. There are 8,515 women who worked prior to first birth--2,054 Af-
4In the 1973 and 1976 cycles of the NSFG, the questionnaire item on early work experience is phrased as "work between marriage and first birth." In the NSFG from 1982 and 1988, the item on early work experience is phrased as "work before first birth" without reference to marriage. The reference to marriage in the earlier cycles is another reason our analysis is limited to women who were evermarried. In addition, the question wording is not exactly the same across surveys, and the results should be interpreted with this caveat in mind.

rican American women and 6,461 white women--and 5,223 women who did not work prior to first birth--1,931 African American women and 3,292 white women. The analysis utilizes a dummy variable least squares (DVLS) regression approach. The definition and operationalization of the variables employed are as follows:
--Wanted fertility was the total number of live births that were self-reported as wanted at the time of conception;
--Unwanted fertility was the total number of live births that were selfreported as unwanted at the time of conception;
--Respondent's age atfirstmarriage was the respondent's age (in years) at the time of her first marriage;
--Exposure to the risk of an additional birth was the number of months from the birth of the last wanted child to the time of the interview;
--Age was the respondent's age (in years) at the time of the interview;
--Race was a dummy variable set equal to one if the respondent was African American, or zero if the respondent was white;
--Religion was a dummy variable set equal to one if the respondent was Catholic, or zero if the respondent was non-Catholic;
--Female education at the two life course points was set of five dummy variables coded as follows: 1 = 0-8 years, 0 = others (reference group in regression analysis); 1 = 9-11 years, 0 = others; 1 = 12 years, 0 = others; 1 = 13-15 years, 0 = others; 1 = 16+ years, 0 = others;
--Region was a dummy variable set equal to one if the respondent lived in the South, or zero if the respondent lived elsewhere;
--Residence was a dummy variable set equal to one if the respondent lived in the non-metropolitan area, or zero if

the respondent lived in a metropolitan area; --Marital disruption was a dummy variable set equal to one if the respondent was ever divorced, widowed, or separated, or zero if the respondent was in her first marriage.
Wanted and unwanted fertility are treated as dependent variables. The respondent's age, age at first marriage, and exposure to the risk of an additional (unwanted) birth are considered demographic control variables because they are known to vary by both race and education level and to be related to completed fertility. In addition, we control for racial differences in region and residence patterns. Women living in the South and women living in nonmetropolitan areas generally exhibit higher fertility than women who live in other areas, and African Americans and whites vary in their tendency to live in these areas. We also control for religious affiliation in order to remove fertility differences due to religious composition.5
We estimate dummy variable regression models of the following form for measures of education at two points in the life course:
(1)
5Dummy variables for year of survey are included in the regression equations to capture time trends for the variables in the model. For example, during the time frame of this study, it is well-known that fertility was generally decreasing and female labor force participation was increasing. The reference category in the regression equations for the time period dummy variables is 1988.

whereFy is the predicted fertility of the ith woman in the /th education category, ao is the regression constant which is equal to the predicted fertility of the omitted race/education group, Rj is a dummy variable for race, and bj are the average fertility deviations from the regression constant for education categories of the omitted race group, the Edj are dummy variables for education categories, the bk are the average fertility deviations from the bj for education categories of the included race group, the Rt* Edtj are dummy variables for included race/education groups, and the bl are coefficients on the control variables, Cn. In order to assess the pattern of interaction effects, we plot predicted mean levels of fertility for the various combinations of categories of race and education, holding constant the other variables (i.e., we compute predicted mean fertility after assigning all respondents the sample mean on the control variables).
RESULTS
The means and standard deviations of the variables included in the regression analyses are reported in Table 1. On average, women who were not working at the time of their first birth report higher fertility than those who did work, by almost one-third of a child. Among women in the notworking group, 37 per cent were African American as compared to the working group in which 24 per cent were African American. In terms of higher education, a greater percentage of women who worked before their first birth reported at least four years of college as compared to women who did not work before the birth of their first

child. However, when comparing the differences between education measured earlier in the adult life course versus education measured at the end of childbearing, not-working women increased their representation in the highest group by 250 per cent whereas working women increased their representation by only 50 per cent. This difference may be indicative of the notworking women delaying the completion of their education as a result of childbearing and child-rearing responsibilities.
The regression coefficients from the models constructed to assess the race by education effects on the fertility measures among ever-married women who worked and who did not work prior to the birth of their first child are presented in Table 2.6 This table is divided into two parts (Panel A and Panel B). Panel A contains the regressions for our model with education measured early in the adult life course. Panel B contains similar regression models with education measured later in the life course.
The relationships among the independent variables and the measures of wanted and unwanted fertility are generally as would be expected in both sets of estimates (Panels A and B: the exceptions among the race-by-education interaction effects are discussed in
6We have also estimated regression models of the type reported here based on respondents' current working status with education status measured at two different points in the life course. It is interesting to note in the case of later employment status (measured at the time of the interview) there is no statistical difference for African American and white fertility among highly educated women, regardless of whether total fertility or wanted and unwanted fertility are employed as dependent variables. Tables summarizing the estimates from these analyses are available from the authors.

more detail below). For example, African Americans are characterized by higher levels of both wanted and unwanted childbearing, as are Catholics, and both of these patterns hold irrespective of whether the women worked prior to the birth of their first child. Also, levels of both wanted and unwanted childbearing generally decrease with rising education regardless of when education is measured during the life course, although the relationship is not always perfectly monotonic. The control variables also behave as would be expected. To take just two examples, the number of wanted births increases with age, reflecting the higher fertility of earlier birth cohorts of women. Also, net of exposure to risk, the number of unwanted births decreases with age, probably reflecting the greater motivation of women in the later stages of childbearing to prevent unwanted fertility.
Our main interest is in whether the pattern of educational differences in fertility varies between the two racial groups for the two measures of childbearing. We first tested for the significance of interaction effects on fertility of race and education by adding the set of race-by-education dummy variables to an additive model containing terms only for race, the control variables, and the education categories. The results of these tests (for increments in explained variance resulting from including the set of interaction terms) are presented in Table 3. They reveal that, for all three measures of fertility among both women who worked and those who did not work prior to the birth of their first child, the education/ fertility relationship varies between African Americans and whites.

The race by early education (i.e., education at first marriage) interactions show a generally monotonic, negative relationship with both wanted and unwanted fertility, except among unwanted fertility for women who did not work before the birth of the first child (Panel A).7 With this exception in mind, these results are consistent with much of the literature showing that the fertility of African Americans decreases with increases in higher education. A similar pattern of effects is noted in Panel B except that when measuring education later in the life course (i.e., education after completed childbearing) the negative pattern for unwanted fertility also holds for women who were not working earlier in the life course. Thus, the effects are more consistent across the two types of fertility when education is measured later in life. These effects are interesting but they do not in and of themselves show conclusively whether and under what circumstances results involving wanted childbearing provide
7For the control variables and the education variables, levels of statistical significance are estimated using a two-tailed test because we are not testing specific theories regarding these relationships. However, for the race by education interaction effects, we are employing one-tailed tests of significance as we are testing specific hypothesis with expectations about the direction of effects.

superior tests of the minority group status hypothesis.
To more fully assess this possibility, it is necessary to estimate the predicted fertility of African American and white women and compare the differences. The nature of the patterns can be seen in Figures 2 and 3, which present plots of the relationships for ever-married women by when education is measured during the life course. For purposes of comparison, we also provide plots of predicted total fertility for each race group. We see in the case of the total number of births that the pattern for both women who did and did not work before the birth of their first child for both measures of education involves higher fertility among African American women at lower levels of education, with a steady diminished fertility differential as education increases.
The total fertility of women of higher education does not differ significantly between African Americans and whites, as has been observed in previous research. Interestingly, the predicted total fertility occurring to highly educated African American women who did not work prior to first birth falls below that of their white counterparts when employing the early education measure, although this difference is not statistically significant

(see Table 4 for a summary of the adjusted mean fertility differences along with estimates of statistical significance). Thus, evidence based on the kind of measure of total fertility used in previous research instead of the wanted and unwanted fertility components generally supports a "weak" form of the social characteristics interpretation.
By contrast, the patterns of interaction effects for wanted childbearing (presented in the middle graphs in Panels A and B of Figures 2 and 3) reveal a "crossover" pattern among women who worked, but this difference is statistically significant only when education is measured later in the life course. African American women who worked prior to the birth of their first child have about one-tenth of a child less than similar white women. This crossover occurs despite evidence from other surveys that shows that collegeeducated African American women on average experience their first birth earlier in the life course than collegeeducated white women (Rindfuss, Morgan, and Swicegood, 1988).
In addition, among women who did not work prior to the birth of their first child, an obvious cross-over pattern occurs, and the differences are statistically significant regardless of when education is measured. Hence, the wanted fertility of highly educated African American women who did not work prior to the birth of their first child falls below that of comparable highly educated whites. As shown in Table 4, this difference involves a level of wanted childbearing among highly educated African American women (as assessed by later education) that is about one-third of a child per woman

less than that of a similar highly educated white woman. When education is measured at first marriage, the difference is about four-tenths of a child.
We also tested for the greater likelihood that this pattern would characterize earlier birth cohorts whose members undoubtedly faced greater discrimination and barriers to the realization of mobility aspirations. We found that this was indeed characteristic of the earlier but not the later cohort. Women born before 1945 showed the race-by-education cross-over pattern in the case of wanted childbearing whereas women born in 1945 or after did not (these results may be obtained from the authors upon request).
Turning to the pattern for unwanted fertility, shown in the far right-hand graphs of Figures 2 and 3, we observe among African American women who both did and did not work prior to the birth of their first child that unwanted childbearing remains higher at every educational level than it does among whites, although the differences tend to decrease with rising education. These differences are statistically significant and at the highest education level range from one-tenth to one-third of a child.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The results of this research hold a number of implications for alternative hypotheses about racial differences in fertility by education. For example, the results suggest the usefulness of taking into account different fertility components when examining alternative hypotheses about the pattern of education effects on fertility.

the results have implications similar to those stemming from the research of St. John and Grasmick (1985), whereas their findings suggest that during the early stages of the reproductive process highly educated African American women are more likely than similar whites to engage in behaviors (e.g., earlier ages at first birth) that lead to higher cumulative fertility, but that during the later stages they are likely to curtail fertility. It is important to note that research examining cumulative fertility, that is to saythenumber of births at the endof the reproductive process, may fail to detect such early life course differences in fertility behavior between highly educated African American and white women.

Other research indicates that itis often useful to conceptualize each birth interval as a separate point at which couples make decisions about fertility (e.g., Hout, 1978; Namboodiri, 1974). In a similar vein, the results of this study indicate different education/ fertility patterns by race depending upon whether total, wanted, or unwanted fertility is examined. According to our definition, unwanted births occur only after wanted births. This means that the present findings support the notion that African American and white women not only confront constraints on childbearing that differ across points in thereproductive process, but also that the two groups of women confront different constraints

depending upon their levels of education.
What do these results imply for the two major approaches--the minority group status and the social characteristics hypotheses--that have most often been employed as explanations of African American/white fertility differences by education? They provide some support for each perspective. Consider first the minority group status hypothesis. The key and most interesting prediction of this hypothesis is that African American women of higher socioeconomic status will exhibit lower fertility than white women of comparable socioeconomic standing (Goldscheider and Uhlenberg, 1969, p. 371). The reason is not only because more highly educated women have higher aspirations for social mobility than less educated women, but also because African American women find their aspirations more difficult to realize owing to societal patterns of discrimination. To compensate, they lower their fertility in order to achieve and sustain socioeconomic goals. In the words of E. Franklin Frazier (1957, p. 331), "Men and women who have struggled to achieve a high position in the Negro community are not inclined to have the standards which they attempt to maintain lowered by the burden of children."
In the present research, the finding that wanted childbearing among highly educated African American women (regardless of whether they worked before the birth of their first child) falls below that of similar whites indicates that the mechanisms posited by the minority group status hypothesis may indeed operate to reduce the fertility of some African American women below

that of similar white women. It is significant that a pattern consistent with this hypothesis occurs in the case of wanted rather than unwanted fertility. Of the two components of childbearing examined in this research, wanted fertility is more likely to reflect the influence of the kinds of demand-related forces emphasized in the rationale behind the hypothesis. It is also noteworthy that highly educated African American women who did not work prior to the birth of their first child show levels of wanted fertility that are nearly a third to a half less than their white counterparts. We theorized that women who worked before their first birth would be most disposed to behave in the manner predicted by the hypothesis. Yet the general pattern expected by the minority group status hypothesis appears to be stronger for women who did not work before the birth of the first child. The appearance of a race-by-education interaction effect among women from earlier birth cohorts implies that the compensatory processes posited by the hypothesis are of greatest value for understanding racial fertility differences under the circumstance where greater discrimination may have occurred against African Americans.
The verdict about the social characteristics hypothesis is similar. In its "strong" version, the hypothesis predicts that differences in fertility between African American and white women result entirely from differences in other variables affecting fertility. In its "weak" version, the hypothesis predicts this finding only among women of higher socioeconomic standing. However, because it focuses only on compositional effects, it provides little

basis on which to develop a priori expectations about where empirical support for it might be most likely to emerge, thus illustrating one of its fundamental weaknesses. The pattern predicted by the "weak" version of the hypothesis occurs only for total fertility, whereas the wanted and unwanted components reveal different results.
It is of particular interest that the unwanted childbearing of highly educated African American women remains (statistically) higher than it does among highly educated white women in three out of four cases, regardless of early life work experience. In short, even among highly educated African American women we see evidence that is inconsistent with the idea that such African American women are completely "assimilated," to use the language of the social characteristics approach, into majority patterns of reproductive behavior. Whether this comes about because they practice contraception less effectively (which might be consistent with a "subcultural" hypothesis predicting higher African American fertility), or because they have more limited access to the full range of contraceptive options and technologies available in the society, is an important question for further research. In either case, the pattern suggests that the social characteristics hypothesis is not fully adequate to explain patterns of differential fertility between African Americans and whites when the question is addressed by taking into account separate components of fertility.
In sum, this paper adds to the understanding of race differences in fertility in five related ways: (a) we discuss and test the two most common hypoth-

eses in this area (minority groups status and characteristics hypotheses); (b) we combine data from four national fertility surveys, giving us adequate sample size to allow confidence in the statistical differences among black and white women at the highest education levels; (c) we evaluate not only total fertility, but we also provide a rationale for examining wanted and unwanted births --defined at the time of conception, not at the time of birth; (d) we generally find results consistent with our prediction that minority group status effects are most likely to emerge in the case of wanted births; and (e) we push the boundaries of this line of research back in a modest fashion by introducing a straightforward birth cohort analysis, clarifying the findings of our original analyses.
Finally, we would note the policy implications that follow from the results of this study. Socioeconomic status dampens fertility levels among all race groups, but this research shows that it is particularly salient for African American women. Efforts to maintain a level playing field with regards to educational and employment opportunities must be continued if African American women are to lower their overall fertility to the levels of white women. In addition, we have shown how differences between these two groups of women are related to the higher rate of unwanted fertility among African American women of all education levels. To reduce the racial differences in unwanted fertility, mechanisms for ensuring that contraceptive technology continues to be relatively inexpensive and widely available should be enhanced so that all women can better control this aspect of their lives.
