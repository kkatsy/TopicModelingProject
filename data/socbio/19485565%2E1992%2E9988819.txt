Effects of Interpregnancy Intervals on Preterm Birth, Intrauterine Growth Retardation, and Fetal Loss

ABSTRACT: This study examines the magnitude and shape of the interpregnancy interval (IPI) effect on three pregnancy outcomes: preterm low birthweight (PRETERM-LBW), intrauterine growth-retardation low birthweight (IUGR-LBW), and fetal loss (LOSS). A multinomial logistic regression model is estimated, based on data from the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth which contains pregnancy histories. The results indicate that both short and long intervals raise the risk of IUGR-LBW and LOSS, net of sociodemographic and behavioral variables, but IPI effects on PRETERM-LBW are not clear.
The consistent finding that short also examined whether gestational age preceding birth intervals are associated confounds birth interval effects on with increased risk of infant mortality pregnancy outcomes, but focused on has generated several lines of research low birthweight (LBW) as the outwhich zero in on the components of the come.

association, PRETERM and IUGR pregnancy outcomes are two causal components within the overall association, and are strong predictors of subsequent infant mortality.
Few studies to date have looked at how pregnancy spacing directly affects these outcomes separately within one study sample. A case-control study by Ferraz et al. (1988), undertaken in Brazil, found short interpregnancy intervals (IPI) to be associated with IUGR, although when the mother's postpartum weight was controlled (their proxy for prepregnancy weight), the IPI effect became insignificant in their analysis. IPI never displayed an effect on PRETERM, however. Lieberman et al. (1989) examined the effect of IPI on IUGR. Their results indicated that very short IPI's (less than three months) were associated with the highest risk of subsequent IUGR, although there were few effects of any other interval length longer than the 0-3 months interval. Lang et al. (1990) examined the IPI effect on PRETERM and found no significant effects. Studies prior to the above have examined the IPI effect on LBW overall (Eisner, 1979; Fortney and Higgins, 1984; Spiers and Wang, 1976) or neonatal mortality, with most showing adverse effects of short IPI's.
Late pregnancy loss or stillbirth was a component of Miller's dependent variable, perinatal mortality, but fetal loss (including spontaneous abortion) is less often examined than is low birthweight or infant mortality in studies of birth interval effects. The relationship between IPI and subsequent fetal loss raises additional complexities to be discussed, but previous studies usually

find either a U-shaped or J-shaped association between IPI and LOSS (Casterline, 1989; Mostafa, 1991; Swensen and Harper, 1978; Zimmer, 1979).
This study looks at the IPI effect on these three outcomes separately--preterm low birthweight (PRETERMLBW), intrauterine growth-retardation low birthweight (IUGR-LBW), and fetal loss (LOSS)-so that the effect of IPI and other independent variables can be compared across outcomes. These outcomes appear to share similar sociodemographic risk factors but may have different proximate determinants (Bragonier et al., 1983; Institute of Medicine, 1985; Kramer, 1987).
The data used in this study do not include measures of proximate determinants (such as weight gain), and we cannot look at possible factors such as maternal depletion which may account for the relationship between IPI and adverse outcomes. The shape of the relationship can be described, however, which sheds light on the broader link between birth intervals and infant mortality that has often been observed. The inclusion of confounding sociodemographic and (limited) behavioral variables in a multivariate model will clarify the effect of IPI. These variables are important in their own right as demographic and behavioral risk factors whose effects will be compared across different pregnancy outcomes.
The interpregnancy interval is the appropriate interval to use as an independent variable in models that predict pregnancy outcomes (as in studies by Ferraz, 1988; Lieberman, 1989; Spiers and Wang, 1976). Earlier studies using birth intervals to study interval effects

on infant mortality usually did not have measures of interpregnancy intervals (or gestation data).
The present study differs from most other studies that examine interval effects (whether birth or interpregnancy interval) in that it uses U.S. national survey data rather than vital statistics data or hospital data. Also, there has been little research on this topic for the U.S. population. The Ferraz et al. study of PRETERM and IUGR is based on hospital data from a Brazilian city. The Lieberman et al. study of IUGR and the Lang et al. study of PRETERM are based on Boston hospital data. Gribble's study of low birthweight is one of the few analyses based on survey data (respondents were sampled from health centers in Mexico). Miller's study of perinatal mortality is based on vital records data (compiled by W.H.O.) from Sweden and Hungary. Spiers and Wang's study of LBW (overall) as an intervening variable between IPI and SIDS is based on North Carolina vital statistics. Fortney and Higgins' study of perinatal mortality and overall LBW is based on hospital data from Iran.
The use of U.S. national survey data containing pregnancy histories has potential pluses and minuses. The advantages over hospital data include greater generalizability and greater variability of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics (advantages shared with vital statistics data). The limitations include inferior data quality due to recall error inherent in retrospective data, the reliance on self-report rather than medical diagnosis (for pregnancy outcome, conception date, and gestational age), and small sample sizes. Overall,

the quality of the data in the present study appears to be adequate, based on comparisons with external datasets. I address these issues in the following section and at the conclusion of the paper when I consider how response error may affect the results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data come from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), Cycle 4, collected in 1988. The NSFG is a periodic survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, providing information on fertility, family planning, and maternal and child health. The survey is designed to represent the U.S. noninstitutional population of women aged 15-44. Cycle 4 interviewed 8,450 women, selected according to a 5-stage area probability design with oversampling of blacks. Personal interviews were conducted between January and August of 1988 by female interviewers. A primary focus of the interview was the collection of a pregnancy history which asks each respondent about the outcome, date of outcome, and gestation length in weeks of each of her pregnancies. To obtain the outcome data, respondents were shown a flashcard with the choices being: live birth, induced abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, or ectopic pregnancy. For a live birth, they were asked the infant's weight in pounds and ounces. Not all respondents reported exact weights, and these respondents were then asked whether the child was above or below 5.5 pounds.
The most recent pregnancy is the unit of analysis in this study (the index pregnancy). I use (index) pregnancies

that were completed within ten years of the survey (pregnancies ending between 1978 and 1987). In order to analyze only completed index pregnancies, I eliminated pregnancies beginning less than ten months before the survey. Index pregnancies were also excluded if they had any of the following characteristics-- (a) first pregnancies; (6) ended in induced abortion or ectopic pregnancy (there are few ectopic pregnancies in the data); (c) multiple outcomes; (d) missing gestation data. The study is limited to white and black respondents, some of whom are of hispanic origin. The final sample size is 2,104 pregnancies. All analyses are based on weighted data, to account for the stratified sample design (individual weight divided by mean sample weight was used).
In this study, a birth is defined as PRETERM-LBW if it is less than 5 pounds 9 ounces (LBW) and with a gestational age of less than 37 weeks. IUGR-LBW is defined as less than 5 pounds 9 ounces (LBW) with a gestational age of 37 or more weeks. These definitions are approximations of the more common (clinical) definition of PRETERM (less than 37 weeks) and IUGR (below the tenth percentile of a normed distribution of birthweight for gestational age).
Fetal loss (LOSS) is defined as a spontaneous loss at any time during pregnancy: early and late losses'are included (i.e., spontaneous abortions and stillbirths), but ectopic pregnancies are excluded as mentioned before.
The analysis sample has a white LBW rate of 4.1 (compared to 5.6 in 1983 vital statistics) and a black rate of 13.7 (compared to 12.6 in 1983 vital statistics). (Vital statistics were ob-

tained from U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 1988). Our data show that 59 per cent of LBW births (combined races) are PRETERM rather than IUGR, while vital statistics shows 56 per cent PRETERM-LBW (Taffel, 1989). The pregnancy outcome rates in this study, then, are fairly close to what 1983 vital statistics data show (1983 being the midpoint of the retrospective time interval used in this study), although somewhat lower for whites and slightly higher for blacks. First pregnancies are excluded, however, and the analysis sample is limited to the recent pregnancy.
The fetal loss rate in the study sample is 8 per cent, calculated from the total number of losses divided by all outcomes other than induced abortions. This fetal loss rate is lower than most clinical studies based on prospective data with life-table estimates which report a rate of between 13 and 15 per cent for recognized pregnancies (Leridon, 1977). However, 10 per cent of recognized pregnancies miscarried in a recent clinical study (StagnaroGreen et al., 1990). Lindbohm and Hemminki (1988) report a rate of 8.9 per cent based on the Finnish data base of medically diagnosed spontaneous abortion from hospital discharges and polyclinic records. The NSFG data do produce a fetal loss rate of approximately 13 per cent when the calculation is based on all pregnancies to all women (which would include more "repeat losses" in the calculation). Underreporting of losses, especially early losses, is likely, however.
As another check on the data, the distribution of months between live births of parity two and higher, by race, was compared to published vital

statistics data (National Center for Health Statistics, 1989) (IPI distributions are not available, to my knowledge, in published tabulated form for comparison). The distributions in my NSFG sample were very similar to that of vital statistics data.
VARIABLE DEFINITIONS AND
BIVARIATE ASSOCIATIONS
Because the focus of the study is on the size and shape of the net effect of IPI across the three outcomes, a multivariate model (estimated by logistic regression) is used to control for extraneous variables, most of which are sociodemographic. The final model includes the variables: interpregnancy interval (IPI), race, education, age at pregnancy, pregnancy order, prior pregnancy outcome, and smoking.
Table 1 presents bivariate relationships between the independent variables and pregnancy outcome. IPI is categorized into five groups to allow for nonlinear relationships: 0-6 months, 7-12,13-24, 25-48, and 49 + months. This categorization is optimal given the sample size in the present study and allows comparisons with most previous studies. The first two categories each contain approximately one eighth of the sample observations, and the remaining three categories each contain roughly one quarter of the sample cases. In Table 1 there is little association between IPI and PRETERM-LBW, but there is a slight U-shaped relationship between IPI and both IUGR-LBW and LOSS. The relationship between IPI and rates of normal pregnancy has an inverted U-shape, suggesting in a more summarized way that short and long IPI's are associated with adverse outcomes as a

whole. However, a multivariate analysis is needed to analyze these relationships since IPI is associated with most of the other independent variables.
Age at pregnancy outcome (AGE) has the categories 15-24, 25-34, and 35 + , which yields sufficient sample sizes in each category, although an ideal grouping might allow finer categories. Table 1 shows a generally U-shaped bivariate association between age and each of the pregnancy outcomes. Mean pregnancy order (ORDER) is lowest for normal births relative to the three other outcomes, but there appears to be no relationship between pregnancy order and the adverse outcomes contrasted with each other. Outcome of the prior pregnancy has a strong bivariate association with outcome of the current (index) pregnancy, as expected, although prior adverse outcomes of one type are also predictors of another type. Blacks are several times more likely to have a PRETERM-LBW or IUGR-LBW outcome than whites, but fetal loss rates do not vary by race in this sample.
Socioeconomic status is often associated with pregnancy outcome as well as pregnancy spacing in prior studies, and thus it is a necessary control in the multivariate analysis. The indicator of socioeconomic status in this study is the woman's education in years (EDUC). It is measured at the time of the survey, which in most cases is a good proxy for their education at the time of pregnancy. Income, however, could not be used because it is not available for time periods more than a year before the interview. Table 1 shows that a higher level of education is associated with a lower rate of LBW, but this is not the case for fetal

Smoking (SMOKE) is a dichotomous variable based on the question: "Did you smoke cigarettes at all during the last twelve months before the end of your last pregnancy?" Smoking has a strong positive association with

the adverse pregnancy outcomes in Table 1.

study sample (those data are not collected for pregnancies more than a few years from the survey date). Marital status and alcohol consumption (crudely measured) were tested but dropped from the analysis because neither improved the fit of the overall model. As the forthcoming analysis shows, the variables in Table 1 have the same directions of relationship with pregnancy outcome when analyzed in a multivariate model as they do on a bivariate level.
MODEL SPECIFICATION
Multinomial logistic regression analysis is used for model estimation. The polytomous dependent variable, pregnancy outcome, uses the four categories: PRETERM-LBW, IUGR-LBW, LOSS, and NORMAL birthweight (latter category as reference category). Estimation of a multinomial logit model is analogous to the simultaneous estimation of several binary logit models: a set of J-l coefficients is estimated for each explanatory variable, where J equals the number of categories of the dependent variable. The estimated coefficients indicate the effect of the independent variables on the log-odds (or odds when exponentiated) of each adverse outcome category relative to the normal birthweight category. Model estimation was carried out using Systat 5.1 (Steinberg and Colla, 1991).
The analysis focuses on the effect of IPI on each outcome net of demographic control variables, rather than on quantifying the extent to which demographic variables account for the IPI effect. I present the results from one final model (Table 2) that simultaneously includes the predictor vari-

ables: age at pregnancy, pregnancy order, race, prior pregnancy outcomes, smoking, and interpregnancy interval (IPI). None of the intercorrelations among the independent variables in the model are high, and there is little evidence of multicollinearity. For example, the correlation between IPI and age at pregnancy is 0.36; IPI and pregnancy order are correlated at --0.13. Given the sample sizes relative to the number of independent variables, interaction tests had to be limited.
Dummy variable coding is used for all categorical variables with the exception of IPI, for which marginal (effect) coding is used. The coefficients based on marginal coding are interpreted as the ratio between a particular IPI group's odds relative to the "average" odds (unweighted mean odds) for all categories combined. Marginal coding will facilitate the interpretation of interactions between IPI and other variables in the model, as described later. Marginal and dummy coding yield results that are identical with respect to model fit (model chi-squares and loglikelihoods) and predicted probabilities, the latter being the primary mode of communicating the effects of IPI.
MULTIVARIATE RESULTS
The odds ratios, calculated by exponentiating the log-odds coefficients from the regressions, are shown in Table 2. They are adjusted for all other independent variables. In discussing the odds ratios, all comparisons involve the particular pregnancy outcome in question relative to the normal birthweight outcome (reference category), as described above. Looking at the control variables first in Table 2,

age at pregnancy outcome has significant effects only on the risk of fetal loss (relative to normal birthweight outcome). The age 15-24 group is almost twice as likely to have a loss relative to the reference group (ages 25-34) while the age 35+ group is more than two and a half times more likely to have a loss relative to the reference group (ages 25-34). Age has no effect on the LBW outcomes, however. Other operationalizations of the age variable, such as allowing it to be continuous with polynomial terms, did not yield significant coefficients or improve the fit of the model.
A higher pregnancy order (ORDER) significantly raises the odds of fetal loss, but not PRETERM-LBW or IUGR-LBW which is consistent with most other research.

Blacks are 2.6 times more likely than whites to have a PRETERMLBW outcome, and 4.4 times more likely to have an IUGR-LBW, net of other variables. There is no race difference in fetal loss, however.
Higher EDUCATION level has no significant effect on the LBW outcomes (although the coefficient for PRETERM-LBW is almost significant: /7<0.06) but significantly raises the odds of fetal loss. The latter is a surprising finding; the same direction of relationship appears at both univariate and multivariate levels. Education differentials in the completeness of reporting pregnancy loss in the interview is possible; Casterline (1989) also found a significant positive effect of education on fetal loss for some developing countries.

The net effects of SMOKING are to raise the risk of PRETERM-LBW, IUGR-LBW, and LOSS by a factor of two, each relative to normal outcome. PRIOR OUTCOME has significant net effects on the index pregnancy outcome. When the previous pregnancy had a LBW outcome (without distinguishing prior PRETERM-LBW and prior IUGR-LBW), the odds of subsequent PRETERM-LBW are raised by a factor of 3.4; IUGR-LBW, by a factor of nearly 3.8; and LOSS, by a factor of 1.9. A prior pregnancy ending in loss raises the odds of PRETERMLBW by a factor of 3, does not significantly raise the odds of IUGR-LBW, and raises the odds of LOSS by a factor of 2.2.
When studying IPI effects it is useful to allow the analysis sample to include such adverse prior outcomes, if the model explicitly includes the appropriate interaction terms (prior outcome*IPI). Largely for analytical reasons, some earlier studies exclude observations (index pregnancies) when the previous pregnancy was not fullterm. Excluding index pregnancies when the prior pregnancy ended in loss or LBW without making a selectivity correction may lead to biased estimates of effects of independent variables, inasmuch as prior outcome is a determinant of index pregnancy outcome.
EFFECTS OF INTERPREGNANCY
INTERVAL
Interpregnancy interval significantly improves the fit of the multinomial model (p < 0.001) according to likelihood ratio tests. When IPI is added to a model containing the variables discussed thus far, the - 2 LL (loglikelihood) equals 185.45, df=36. The

model not containing IPI has a - 2 LL of 151.54, df=24. Other operationalizations of IPI, such as specifying IPI as a continuous variable with polynomial terms (quadratic and/or cubic), do not improve the model fit.
We would expect that some of the factors determining pregnancy spacing are different when prior fetal loss is involved. It has been shown that women tend to conceive sooner following a loss than following a live birth (Zimmer, 1979), and prior loss is itself a determinant of pregnancy spacing. Additional biologic determinants become relevant when prior loss is involved, such as the shorter period of postpartum amenorrhea and (in some populations) a. shorter anovulatory period following a loss. Social psychological processes may operate differently as well. There is also evidence from previous research that the effect of IPI partly depends on whether the previous outcome was a loss or not, with short IPI following a loss having less of an adverse effect or none at all (Institute of Medicine, 1985).
As a first step in the multivariate analysis, I tested an interaction between prior loss and IPI. The overall interaction was not significant (p= 0.23) according to likelihood ratio tests in which a model that includes all of the IPPPRIORLOSS interaction terms was compared with the previous additive model. Small cell sizes (few prior losses within IPI categories) could account for the nonsignificance. Using several datasets from developing countries, Casterline (1989) also found no interactive effect between IPI and prior loss. I will come back to this interaction question after presenting the IPI results based on the additive model.

generated two probability graphs (of the type in Figure 1) from a model that includes the ("part") interaction term. One graph was produced with PRIOR LOSS set to "yes" in the equation and one based on PRIOR LOSS set to "no" in the equation (in both cases with the other variables set at their means). The graphs were similar, and both of them, but especially the latter, look similar to Figure 1. But, in the PRIORLOSS = yes graph: (1) the adverse effect of short intervals on LOSS is weaker (the line starts off lower) due to the interaction; (2) the adverse effect of shorter IPI's on IUGR-LBW

almost disappears; (3) IPI(0-6) group has an even lower risk of PRETERMLBW but its shape still appears to be random.
Conversely, in the PRIORLOSS = no graph, the adverse effect of short intervals is accentuated for each outcome--the lines all start off at a slightly higher point. Thus, there is an indication that the adverse effect of short intervals on each of the adverse outcomes is dampened when the prior pregnancy ends in loss. This is consistent with some other research that examined this question and may indicate that maternal resources are not

depleted to the same extent when a prior pregnancy aborts. Still, the interactive effect of prior loss is weak in this analysis.
DISCUSSION
The analysis indicates that short and long interpregnancy intervals increase the risk of both IUGR-LBW and LOSS. The minimum points of their U-shaped curves in Figure 1 occur at different IPI categories. The effect of IPI on PRETERM-LBW shows no discernible trend. The absence of an effect of short IPI on PRETERM-LBW was partly expected (Lang, 1990), although some of the other research which shows that gestational age explains some of the birth-intervalperinatal-mortality relationship (Miller, 1989) or the birth-interval-LBW relationship (Gribble, 1991) would seem to predict an adverse effect of short IPI on PRETERM. Larger samples and replications are required to answer this question.
Ferraz et al. (1988) examined IPI effects on PRETERM and IUGR separately, using hospital data from Brazil. They found no effect of IPI on PRETERM, but there was an effect of short IPI on IUGR, both of which are consistent with my findings. When they included maternal postpartum body weight in their model (their proxy for prepregnancy weight and inpregnancy weight gain), the IPI effect on IUGR became insignificant, which suggests a possible causal mechanism. Lieberman et al. (1989), using Boston hospital data, examined the IPI effect on IUGR only and found that IPI's of less than three months carried the highest risk, the lowest risk being at 24-36 months.

This finding is somewhat consistent with my findings, although our categorizations of IPI differ.
My results show an increase in risk at longer IPI, for IUGR-LBW and LOSS especially. Ferraz et al. (1988) did not look at this question. Gribble (1991), using Mexican data, found that long intervals raise the LBW risk. Spiers and Wang (1976) reported that intervals greater than 47 months raised the risk of LBWusingU.S. data. There is some suggestion in the Lieberman et al. (1989) study of an increased risk of IUGR at longer IPI's.
The increasing risk of LOSS occurring after the IPI(7-12) group in Figure 1 is noteworthy because both age and pregnancy order are fully controlled. Casterline (1989) also reported a U-shaped risk for fetal loss and a strong effect of long intervals in some developing countries but not in others. The finding may reflect lower fecundity, possibly a physiological condition that affects both the ability to conceive and the ability to carry a pregnancy to term. Although I controlled for a few of the demographic variables which are correlates of both the probability of conception and the probability of pregnancy loss--namely, age, and possibly pregnancy order, education, and smoking--other "third" variables that are common determinants of conception and loss (various health conditions) were not controlled.
The observed increase in risk of pregnancy loss with longer IPI may also be an artifact of unreported losses, if IPI's appear in the data to be "long" because some losses are not recognized and/or not reported. If this underreporting is more common among highrisk women, then the risk of loss would

appear to rise with longer IPI's. Underreporting of previous loss could also lead to artifactual effects of long IPI on IUGR-LBW and PRETERM-LBW, though there was little evidence of an IPI association with the latter. The underreporting of previous induced abortions may also be part of the explanation. Because this study is based on retrospective pregnancy history data and depends on accurate recall of events, such questions of data quality must be reconsidered. There are several potential sources of error in recalled data, involving both underreporting (nonreporting) of events and inaccurate dating of events that are recalled.
UNDERREPORTING
Although the data quality appears to be sufficient based on comparisons with vital statistics, some underreporting most likely has occurred for pregnancy losses, especially those occurring earliest in pregnancy. Unreported events such as losses would be manifested as unreported pregnancies in the NSFG (i.e., they would not enter the NSFG dataset at all). Pregnancy losses occurring farthest from the survey date probably have a higher omission rate, independent of the higher rate of omission that probably occurs for earlygestation losses (Leridon, 1976). Although the fetal loss rates in this study are lower than estimates from other (mainly clinical) studies, the NSFG loss rates do not decrease with time from the survey date in this study sample.
In a study of recall error in the reporting of spontaneous abortion, Wilcox (1984) found that 82 per cent of spontaneous abortions occurring up to

ten years earlier were recalled by respondents, when they were recontacted several years later in a survey that was a followup to a clinical study of menstrual cycles. It is not known whether the 82 per cent figure would apply to the NSFG respondents who were administered structured interviews that probed for complete pregnancy histories (I include all losses in this study, not just spontaneous abortion). Although the probing techniques may be more elaborate in the NSFG which could improve recall, the NSFG respondents did not participate in an earlier clinical study and thus recall could conceivably be lower.
RECALL OF DATES
The accurate reporting of dates of events may be a more significant source of error than is omission of events. Since we are asking respondents to report reproductive dates up to ten years in the past, recall error probably increases through time. The dates of outcomes (live birth or loss outcome date) are subject to error, but gestational age is probably more error prone. The accurate recall of events typically depends on factors such as length of the recall period and saliency of the recalled events, which, in the case of pregnancy loss, might vary by true gestational age. Pregnancy order, parity, total number of losses, and other factors may also play a part. Recall error can take the form of telescoping or event displacement, in which events (probably more salient events) are reported as occurring more frequently than they actually occurred.
Wilcox (1984) found considerable error in recall of dates of spontaneous abortion, although his study indicated
