ABSTRACT: Data from a national survey conducted in 1977 were examined to identify correlates of attitudes toward euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons. The results indicated that race, religious participation, and attitudes toward freedom of expression were directly associated with such attitudes. It was also found that regional variations in such attitudes could be explained by the degree of urbanization of geographic regions.

The issue of euthanasia has become more prominent recently because of advances in medical technology which can prolong life, social changes in which death with dignity has become a major issue, and because of considerable attention being paid by mass media to the issues of death and dying. However, the legal, moral, and social implications of the right to die have never been fully clarified. The issue of euthanasia is somewhat different than the issue of death since it involves rational decision-making on the part of patients, their families, and their physicians. There is also the question of whether a person who is terminally ill has the right to simply take his or her own life or whether this should always be done in consultation with a physician or a board of physicians.
It should be noted that although euthanasia poses a moral dilemma for most people, public approval of euthanasia has increased over the years (Benton, 1978). This increasing approval is crucial, since the legal, moral, and technological issues cannot be resolved if the citizenry is greatly divided on the subject of euthanasia. However, the patterns of approval

and disapproval of euthanasia vary depending on the sociodemographic, socioeconomic, religious, and ideological characteristics of respondents included in previous studies. For example, previous studies suggest that older, less educated, and black respondents are likely to be opposed to euthanasia (Adams et al., 1978; Dempsey, 1975; Kalish, 1963; Kloper and Price, 1978). Sex differences have generally not been found to be relevant.
Perhaps the most important predictors of attitudes toward euthanasia are found to be embedded within the religious behaviors of respondents. Previous studies are conclusive in suggesting that those who are more religious (measured either through multidimensional measures or a single dimension measure such as attendance at religious services) are generally more opposed to euthanasia (Adams et al., 1978; Beswick, 1970; Fletcher, 1977; Jorgenson and Neubecker, 1979; Russell, 1975; Schultz, 1978; Wilson, 1975). Whether differences based on religious affiliation may be relevant is subject to question since most religions explicitly endorse the sacredness of life. However,

since the frequency of attendance in religious services is generally higher among Catholics, it is possible to hypothesize a difference between Catholics and nonCatholics on the issue of euthanasia.
An issue not addressed in previous research on attitudes toward euthanasia is that of freedom of expression and the ideological component in general that may be highly relevant to such attitudes. The choice of euthanasia of suicide on the part of a terminally ill person is his or her own option. People opposed to freedom of expression may also be likely to be opposed to euthanasia and perhaps even more opposed to a terminally ill person opting for suicide. Attitudes toward euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons may be influenced by such factors as one's commitment to freedom of expression for others and political views, since such attitudes involve decisions about freedom of choice (Williams et al., 1976).
The purpose of the present research is to examine patterns of approval and disapproval of euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons. The sample to be analyzed is a full probability sample of noninstitutionalized adult Americans. The analysis of public opinion on the issue of euthanasia and suicide is highly important since the weight of public opinion will eventually determine the legislative, medical-ethical, and religious questions about these issues that will need to be resolved.
The study differs from previous studies in two respects. First, it examines simultaneously the issues of euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons. Second, it incorporates the ideological components deemed essential for analysis of such attitudes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data for this study were derived from the 1977 general social survey conducted by the National Opinion Research Center as part of the national data pro-

gram for social sciences. The survey was based on a full probability sample of clusters of households in the continental United States with 1,530 respondents.' However, a number of exclusions reduced the sample size to 1,398. First, respondents other than black or white were excluded. Second, a respondent must have answered questions on both euthanasia and suicide to be included in the analysis. The regression analysis is based on 1,292 respondents because of listwise deletions.2
ISSUES OF EUTHANASIA ANDSUICIDE
Two questions requiring yes/no responses tapped attitudes toward euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons. The first question asked respondents if they thought that doctors should be allowed by law to end a patient's life by some painless means if an incurably ill patient and his family requested it. The second question asked: "Do you think a person has the right to end his or her own life if this person has an incurable disease?"
INDEPENDENT MEASURES
A number of independent measures were used based on their prior usage in examining euthanasia attitudes. These variables can be categorized into broad categories of sociodemographic, socioeconomic, religious, and ideological dimensions. Sociodemographic dimensions included age, race, sex, and place of residence. The indicators of socioeconomic status were education and family income. Three indicators of religious behavior were religious affiliation (Catholic/non-Catholic), attendance at religious services (ranging from never to

several times a week), and commitment to religious beliefs (strong/not strong).3
Two ideological dimensions were also included, based on the premise that attitudes toward euthanasia and suicide constituted part of one's political ideology and were related to attitudes toward freedom of expression. Political ideology was a self-labeling item, and respondents categorized themselves as liberals, moderates or conservatives. Freedom of expression was a summed scale of attitudes toward freedom of speech for atheists, militants, and communists. Respondents who would permit freedom for all three were considered permitting total freedom of expression, and those who disapproved of freedom for all three were considered permitting no freedom of expression. Those who approved of freedom of speech for one or two but not all three constituted the middle category.
Aside from the above variables, regional variations were also considered.
3The variable of religious commitment or commitment to religious beliefs was based on the question "Would you call yourself a strong (religious preference named) or a not very strong (religious preference named)?" Those who indicated no religious preference were categorized with the "not very strong" group.

Descriptive labels for these variables and regroupings appear in Tables 1 through 3.
RESULTS
Table 1 reports regional variations in the percentage approval of euthanasia and suicide. There were wide geographic variations in attitudes toward euthanasia and suicide. A low of 53 per cent of respondents in the West North Central region and a high of 79 per cent of respondents in the Pacific region approved of euthanasia. The range for approval of suicide was from a low of 29.4 per cent in the West South Central region to a high of 56.5 per cent in the Pacific region. Geographic regions with proportionately higher urban populations were more likely to approve of both euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons.
In examining the variations in these attitudes on the basis of selected indicators, we found that as age increased approval of euthanasia as well as suicide declined. There were wide variations between males and females and between whites and blacks on the issue of euthanasia as well as of suicide. Females and blacks were least likely to approve of euthanasia and suicide. Differences on the basis of

place of residence were not significant for euthanasia although they were significant for suicide. It was evident that bettereducated persons were more likely to approve of both euthanasia and suicide. However, on the basis of family income, approval by the upper-income category was somewhat lower than that by the middle-income category.
There were no significant differences in attitudes on the basis of religious affiliation, but considerable differences on the bases of attendance at religious services and of religious commitment (see Table 3). Those who attended religious services more frequently and those who felt strongly commited to their religious

beliefs showed a lower degree of approval of both euthanasia and suicide. Although political identification was not an indicator of attitudes toward euthanasia, it was an indicator of attitudes toward suicide. The index of freedom of expression was a very clear indicator of attitudes toward euthanasia and suicide. Generally, those who approved of freedom of expression were likely to approve of euthanasia and suicide.
The extent to which one approved of suicide for persons with an incurable disease was also likely to be predictive of one's attitude toward euthanasia. As noted in Table 3, those who approved of suicide also approved of euthanasia 87 out.

of 100 times. However, some who disapprqved of suicide for terminally ill persons did approve of euthanasia.
In order to understand the relative contributions of these variables, we performed two analyses. The results reported in Table 4 indicated that age, sex, place of residence, religious affiliation, socioeconomic indicators (education and income), and political identification had no direct effects on attitudes toward euthanasia except for their contributions through other variables. The variables of direct

predictive significance were race, attendance at religious services, religious cornmitment, and freedom of expression. The results indicated that blacks were less likely to approve of euthanasia as were those who showed a stronger degree of commitment to their religious beliefs and those who attended religious services with a greater frequency. It was also indicated that those who opposed freedom of expression for atheists, militants, and communists were also likely to oppose euthanasia. Addition of suicide approval as a

variable in the model increased the predictive efficiency as well as criterion variance explanation considerably.
These factors were also important in determining the attitudes toward suicide for terminally ill persons. The variables found important for direct predictive purposes were race, place of residence, attendance at religious services, religious commitment, political views, and the freedom of expression index. The criterion variance was primarily explained by attendance at religious services and the freedom of expression index. The indicators of socioeconomic status did not make significant direct contributions toward understanding attitudes toward suicide for terminally ill persons.
Although the variables of age and education were not found to have direct predictive significance, they have indirect effects through the freedom of expression index. In each instance, the correlations were 0.35 in absolute value, suggesting that older and less educated people were less likely to subscribe to the freedom-of-

expression ideology. Thus, it is likely that if the freedom-of-expression index is deleted from the model, the effects of age and education will become prominent. However, similar observations cannot be made about sex since its correlations with variables which have direct effects were generally less than 0.09. The effects of age were also likely to be mediated through the variable of attendance at religious services since the zero-order correlation between age and attendance was 0.18, i.e., older respondents attended religious services more frequently. The effects of family income would become relevant in the same way as the effects of education. However, the correlation of income with freedom of expression was only 0.26 in absolute value.

tional sample. The results indicated that race, religious behavior, and attitudes toward freedom of expression were important predictors in both instances. It also found that there were significant regional variations, and the general pattern appeared to be that those regions which were less urbanized were less likely to approve of euthanasia and suicide. It is important to note that approval of euthanasia as well as of suicide are part of one's general orientation toward freedom of expression, and those who approve of freedom of expression are also likely to approve of choices made by those who will consider ending their lives either by themselves or by asking physicians to end their lives.
An important issue not addressed in the present research because of data limitations is the extent to which those respondents who approve of euthanasia or suicide would take these options if they themselves faced terminal illness. More explicitly, public expression of approval of euthanasia and suicide does not necessarily imply that these respondents might choose the same options if they were faced with the same situation. As has been indicated in a recent study on the issue of discretionary abortion, nearly one-third of the respondents approved of abortion for

others but disapproved of abortion for themselves (or their wives) for economic reasons (Singh, 1978). Assuming that to some extent a similar response might hold in these instances, the attitudes toward euthanasia and suicide, then, cannot be used as a guide for projecting demands for euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons.
It should be also noted that with an increasing tolerance of freedom of expression, which is a direct by-product of education, approval of euthanasia as well asof suicide is likely to increase. Moral and legal dilemmas, then, would have to be resolved, given that the public sentiment already favors euthanasia. Many bioethical questions would have to be confronted in order to arrive at laws and regulations governing administration of euthanistic methods. At the same time, many sociobiological issues would have to be clarified in terms of the roles of physicians, patients, and family members in euthanistic procedures.
