ABSTRACT: A comparison of the age-specific marital fertility experience of three successive cohorts in Taiwan indicates that the later cohorts have experienced progressively higher rates of natural fertility at each age from 15-19 to 35-39. Their fecundability is correspondingly higher and post-partum sterility, shorter. These changes in natural fertility levels occurred almost simultaneously with recorded changes in health and nutrition levels. These findings support the hypothesis that during the process of modernization and the fertility transition, the level of natural fertility increases, potentially as a result of improvements in health and nutrition, and changes in lactation practices. It is the net effect of increases in natural fertility on the one hand and deliberate fertility regulation on the other, that determines the course of fertility over time, especially at early stages of modernization and the fertility transition.

Although there is no doubt that ultimately social and economic modernization is accompanied by declining fertility, this relationship is more ambiguous in the early stages of modernization and the fertility transition. In fact, a positive relationship between modernization and fertility has often been observed, both historically (Petersen, 1960; Borowski, 1970) and currently among less developed societies (Henin, 1968; Kolata, 1975;Romaniuk, 1968,1974,1978; Srinivasanetal.,1979).
It may be argued that in terms of changes in general living conditions, nutrition, and health standards, modernization affects fecundity, fecundability, and fetal mortality, and thereby fertility (see, for instance, Easterlin, 1975, 1978). It has been observed that in the early stages of the fertility transition, fertility actually increases (Petersen, 1960; Nag, 1975; Caldwell, 1976; Borowski, 1970; Barclay, 1954; May, 1978; Kocher, 1977), presumably due to

increases in natural fertility in the absence of deliberate control (Henry, 1961).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This paper presents data on Taiwan at three points during the fertility transition to support the hypothesis of rising natural fertility in the early stages of modernization and the fertility transition. Three successive cross-sections of cohorts aged 35-39, in 1960, 1965, and 1975, namely, the birth cohorts of 192125,1926-30, and 1934-38, respectively, are compared. The data refer to continuously married women who at ages 3539 are nearing the close of their reproductive careers.
The data are taken from the 1965and 1973 KAP surveys, which consist of currently married women aged 20-44 and 20-39 years old, respectively. The cohort aged 35-39 in 1960 was obtained

through the retrospective histories of women aged 40-44 in 1965 for 1960 when they were aged 35-39. In all, the analysis is performed on 499 women born during the years 1921-25,794 born in 1926-30, and 1,553 born in 1934-38.
In Taiwan, fertility began to fall in the late 1950's; consequently, the 192125 birth cohort may be said to represent an early stage of the fertility transition. Secondly, it was only in 1964 that the island-wide family planning program was initiated so that the 1926-30 cohort represents Taiwan at a stage when methods of regulation were more readily available and knowledge and approval more diffused. Finally, during the reproductive career of the 1934-38 cohort, Taiwan was well into the fertility transition, although it cannot be said that the transition was completed.
It may be hypothesized that in Taiwan the 1921-25 birth cohort had experienced much of its fertility at a period when overall levels of modernization were low, so that general living conditions, nutrition, and health standards as well as lactation practices and sexual taboo tended to depress the level of potential natural fertility. Each successive cohort is hypothesized to have gone through its peak reproductive years under conditions which were more favorable to high levels of natural fertility. This implies that they have progressively higher levels of fecundity and fecundability and therefore progressively higher estimates of natural fertility. The following section reviews the changes in health, nutrition, and lactation conditions between the 1940's and 1973to justify the hypothesis of increasing natural fertility. Thereafter, empirical evidence, based on the fertility experience of these three cohorts, is presented.

FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FORINCREASING
NATURAL FERTILITY
Natural fertility is influenced by biological, behavioral, and environmental factors, the most prominent of which are health conditions, diet and nutrition, length of lactation, and intercourse taboos.
Health factors and the incidence of disease affect fecundability and sterility as well as fetal wastage. Diseases associated with subfecundity are venereal diseases (Romaniuk, 1968, 1978; Cantrelle, 1978), malaria (United Nations, 1954), plague, tuberculosis, and probably other febrile diseases. The availability of medical facilities and prenatal care is likely to reduce both the level of fetal wastage and the incidence of complications in childbirth.
Taiwan has clearly experienced improvements in health conditions as seen by the increase in e°0 from 46 in 1940 to 68.4 by 1970, and the fall in the infant mortality rate from 110 in 1950 (Barclay, 1954) to 25 in 1975 (Population Reference Bureau, 1978). On the one hand, the number of doctors per thousand population and the proportion of births taking place in hospitals have increased. On the other hand, the incidence of diseases largely associated with sterility and subfecundity has been reduced (Taiwan Demographic Yearbook, 1977). It was during the decade of the 1950's that significant changes in public health and medical facilities, sanitation, and diet occurred. Medical and health facilities were expanded, and maternal and child health centers were opened. Compulsory insurance of workers and free medical care for the poor was initiated. Malaria stations and X-ray units were established in local

areas. Immunization became widespread; malaria was eradicated, and general preventive medicine practiced. Simultaneously, attention was paid to sanitation, housing conditions, sewage disposal, and water supply. It was as late as 1955 that drainage projects, control of food and drugs, and regulation of milk production and supply took place. Cumulatively, these changes in health, medical facilities, and sanitation are expected to have a positive effect on natural fertility.
Secondly, improved nutrition has been shown to affect natural fertility positively, by raising the level of fecundability (Frisch, 1975; Kolata, 1975; May, 1978; McCabe, 1975). In Taiwan, Mirzaee (1979) concludes that although in the colonial period, improvements in nutrition occurred, food refrigeration facilities were limited. It was in the decade of the 1950's that increase in annual food production rose to 5 per cent, food sanitation improved, and average protein consumption increased steadily from 1946 to 1970.
Thirdly, changes from universal and prolonged lactation to infrequent or short periods of lactation reduce the length of post-partum sterility, and raise the level of natural fertility by reestablishing ovulation earlier (Romaniuk, 1974, 1978; Knodel, 1969,1977,1978). A cross-sectional analysis of lactation patterns in Taiwan (Jain et al., 1970) shows a moderate, negative relationship between length of lactation and level of education and urbanization. Whereas women with no formal education lactated on the average for 11.8 moths, those with a senior-high-school education lactated for 6.5 months. Similarly, whereas rural women lactated on average for 11.3 months, urban women did so for 8.8 months. Though these results

are based on cross-sectional data, it seems justifiable, in view of the secular trend in level of education and urbanization, to infer similar changes in lactational practices over time in Taiwan.
Finally, the breakdown of traditional intercourse taboos tends to increase the frequency of intercourse and thereby fecundability and the level of natural fertility. The most prevalent intercourse taboo pertains to the post-partum periods (Nag, 1962; Caldwell and Caldwell, 1977; Karkal, 1971; Romaniuk, 1978), and to special religious occasions, which vary from culture to culture (for instance, see Chandrasekaran, 1952). Evidence regarding the breakdown of postpartum abstinence, has been recorded for Africa (Caldwell and Caldwell, 1977). Similarly, Nag (1977) hypotheses that in India, modernization has involved a looser adherence to intercourse taboos. Unfortunately, there is little evidence regarding either the existence or the breakdown of intercourse taboos in Taiwan.
RESULTS
EVIDENCE OF AN INCREASE IN NATURAL
FERTILITY
Changes in health and nutrition conditions, and possibly lactation practices between the 1940's and the 1970's suggest a corresponding increase in the level of natural fertility over time in Taiwan. When period data are considered, there is some evidence of an increase in fertility in Taiwan in the pre-transitional stages. Barclay (1954) observes that during the early period of the mortality transition, 1895-1940, a simultaneous increase in fertility occurred. The gross reproduction rate increased from 2.93 in 1905 to 3.30 in 1940, that is, from a total

careers of the three cohorts, while on the other hand, and in the opposite direction, the level of natural fertility has also increased. The observed total marital fertility rate by ages 35-39 fell from 6.443 for the 1921-25 cohort, to 6.154 for the 1926-30 cohort and 6.024 for the 1934-38 cohort, representing a decline in fertility of 4.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent between the experiences of the 1921-25 and 1926-30 cohorts and the 1921-25 and 1934-38 cohorts.
This decline clearly reflects the opposing trends of increasing fertility regulation and natural fertility. The practice of fertility regulation has averted 0.8 per cent fertility among the 1921-25 cohort, 9.2 per cent for the 1926-30 cohort and 21.3 per cent for the 1934-38 cohort. On the other hand, the natural level of total marital fertility has increased by 4.6 and 18.1 per cent between the careers of the 1921-25 and 1926-30, and 1921-25 and 1934-38 cohorts, respectively. In other words, the 6.5 per cent decline in the observed total fertility rate between the 1921-25 and 1934-38 cohorts, reflects a 20.7 per cent increase in averted fertility on the one hand, and an 18.1per cent increase in natural fertility on the other.
COMPONENTS OF NATURAL FERTILITY
Natural fertility is immediately determined by the level of fecundability, post-partum amenorrhea, primary and secondary sterility, and duration of exposure to the risk of pregnancy. In this analysis fecundability may be measured by the length of the first birth interval. It is clear that in this case, the estimate of fecundability will not be contaminated by factors such as post-partum amenorrhea and anovulatory cycles which affect inter-live birth intervals. The second birth interval will include both basic fecundability as well as post-partum

amenorrhea. Primary and secondary sterility and subfecundability is measured by a self-reported variable.
Once again, these components of natural fertility confirm a steady increase in the level of natural fertility between the 1921-25 and 1934-38 cohorts respectively. The first birth interval shows a decline of about 4 months between the experience of the 1921-25 and 1934-38 cohorts, implying that on the average, it took a woman born in the 1921-25 cohort four months longer to conceive her first child. The second birth interval is affected by physiological factors such as post-partum amenorrhea and anovulatory cycles as well as sociocultural factors such as length of practice of lactation, extent of post-partum intercourse taboos, and so on. The second birth interval declines by 2.7 months or 8.4 per cent between the experience of the 1921-25 and the 1926-30 cohorts, and 4.7 months or 16.1 per cent between those of the 1926-30 and the 1934-38 cohorts, and 7.4 months or 23 per cent for the entire period.
Finally, the incidence of primary and secondary sterility and subfecundity may be said to have fallen slightly over the period. The results suggest, however, that it is changes in average fecundability, and especially the length of post-partum sterility, that are responsible for the increase in the level of natural fertility over the course of the reproductive histories of the three cohorts.
These factors, such as declining fecundability and post-partum amenorrhea have arisen as a result of improved health, nutrition, and diet, as well as changes in lactation practices, which are largely associated with the process of modernization. Underlying the observed increases in natural fertility, then, there have been secular changes in
