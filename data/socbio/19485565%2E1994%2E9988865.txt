Dimensions of Adolescent Motherhood in India

ABSTRACT: The practice of early marriage of girls is still widely followed in India. The expectation in the Indian sociocultural milieu that after marriage a woman will become pregnant as soon as possible encourages early onset of maternity and higher adolescent fertility. The age-specific fertility rate for married Indian women 15-19 years ranged between 83 and 89 in the last decade.

This paper attempts to assess the extent of adolescent motherhood in India. It also discusses the social, cultural, and demographic correlates of teenage childbearing.
In the Indian sociocultural milieu, marriage of one's children is obligatory for parents, and early marriage of girls is an accepted norm. This practice is deep-rooted, dating back to preChristian eras (Kapadia, 1955). The social organization and value system in early Hindu society strongly favored early marriage of girls, either before puberty or immediately after puberty.
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, social reform movements and legislative measures (for example, the Sharda Act of 1929) attempted to restrict the practice of early marriage of girls. As is evident from the pattern of age at marriage of women in India shown in Table 1, progress in this regard had been painfully slow.
Although Table 1 indicates that after the Sharda Act in 1930, age at marriage for women began an upward trend, its rate of increase was still only one year per decade. A large majority

of Indian girls are still married-off in their teenage years. Moreover, Indian social and familial conditions, generally involving joint or extended joint family living, are such that immediately after her marriage a young bride can scarcely consider when to have children or how many to have. Also, at this age, she is too young and often too uneducated to think in these terms. The whole pressure of her husband's family with whom she comes to live and the expectation of her natal family are that she will become pregnant as soon as possible, and that having borne one child, she will continue to bear

more (Mandelbaum, 1974). A young bride, often illiterate in rural areas and ignorant about her physiology and reproductive system, does not have much choice except to do whatever she has been told to do either by her motherin-law or husband.
In this setting, it is natural that the incidence of adolescent motherhood is high. Out-of-wedlock motherhood is a taboo in India. However, it can be assumed that such pregnancies end in abortions, often at the hand of unqualified persons, further adding to the miseries of young women.
Table 2 indicates that in addition to a large proportion of married adolescent girls 15-19 years of age, a number of girls 10-14 years old were also married. It is amazing that in spite of all the efforts to restrict it, the custom of child marriage is still being practiced in India.
Nuptiality statistics for Indian women (1981 census) show that of all currently married women 79 per cent of rural women and 72 per cent of urban women were below the age of 20 at the time of marriage. Educational sta-

tistics for adolescents in the 1981 census show that married adolescent girls were relatively less educated than unmarried girls in the same age group (see Table 3).
Table 4 shows the parity of married teenage women in India in the 1981 census. Interestingly, the proportion of mothers was higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Since in India rural fertility is higher than urban fertility (Family Welfare Planning Yearbook, India, 1988-89), this observation appears contradictory. However, the custom of "return marriage" which is often observed in rural India (particularly in north India) may explain this contradiction. In the Indian countryside, where early marriage of girls is common, the marriage is not consummated immediately after marriage. Consummation of the marriage generally takes place after a second ceremony called "return marriage," which is held after a certain interval of time, sometimes several years, when the girl is considered ready for married life. Although, the custom of return marriage is dying, its impact is still

significant enough (particularly in the 15-19 years age group) to explain the fertility differentials between rural and urban adolescent girls.
Table 4 also shows that even in the age group of 10-14 years, a number of girls have experienced motherhood. Although the majority of teenage women who had experienced childbearing were primipara, a number of women had higher parity births.

The fact that in India the fertility level in the adolescent age group is relatively higher than in other countries is evident from the comparisons shown in Table 5. Table 5 indicates that, except for Bangladesh, all other countries had a much lower level of adolescent fertility than India. Bangladesh also follows the custom of early marriage of girls, and the proportion of married girls 15-19 years old in this relatively
