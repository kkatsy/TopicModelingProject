ABSTRACT: Marriage patterns are analyzed in a sample of 750 recently married couples from the city of Beirut. The data provide evidence for a notable religious endogamy (88 per cent of the marriages occur within the same religious community, whereas the expected proportion is 34 per cent), and isolation of Muslims and Christians, with some migration occurring inside each group. Consanguineous marriages are quite frequent within religious communities (26 per cent of all marriages), the most commonly encountered being first-cousin marriages (63 per cent of all consanguineous marriages). Patrilateral parallel-cousin marriage, long favored in the Middle East, no longer seems predominant in the recent generation. All four types of first-cousin marriages are equally preferred. Finally, it is demonstrated that consanguinity correlates negatively with occupational status, educational level, and age at marriage. These social indicators must therefore be devised as independent variables when studying the effects of consanguinity on health parameters. In conclusion, the phenomenon of in-group preference, whether in terms of religion or of family, is still prevalent in this recent urban generation, while some specific patterns of preference may be changing.

The last census undertaken in Lebanon was in 1943,which explains the lack of up-to-date demographic data on the population. According to Courbage and Fargues (1974), the country in 1970 was comprised of about 2,265,000 inhabitants, occupying a territory of 10,400 km2. More than one-third of the population was concentrated in the city of Beirut and its suburbs.
The present-day Lebanese population exhibits a high degree of religious diversity which is ascribable to the ethno-religious history of the region. The geographical configuration of the country has, since ancient times, enhanced encounter and admixture of people of diverse origins (Hitti, 1967). The coastal plain constituted a favored crossroads between Asia, Africa, and Europe, while the mountains served as a

shelter for the persecuted minorities of the surrounding regions.
Seven main communities are officially represented. It seems reasonable to affirm that three communities (Sunnite, Shiite, and Maronite) predominate. The Druze, Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic, and Armenian communities, of medium importance, are the remaining major communities. The other groups (Jewish, Protestant, and other Eastern Christian communities) are smaller minorities (de Vaumas, 1955).
While little information is available on marriages, knowledge of the prevailing mating customs permits us to point to a restriction of the exchange between the communities. However, the degree of isolation varies widely according to the group (Der Kaloustian et al., 1980).

While the Druze community is very closed, marriages between Christian communities are not infrequent. On the other hand, Sunnites and Shiites avoid mating outside their religious groups.
In addition to the religious endogamy, one witnesses the common practice of consanguineous unions. A study by Loiselet et al. (1971) of the general Lebanese population mentions an average incidence of consanguineous marriages of 18 per cent, with the highest rate being among the Druze (41 per cent).
Given this state of affairs, we have undertaken a work the aim of which is to assess the effects of consanguinity on fetal growth and fetal mortality. Starting from the data gathered for this purpose, we found it was feasible to analyze the mating patterns of the respondents, relative to two criteria: (1) religious affiliation, and (2) kinship between spouses.

of marriage; (3) education and occupation of both parents; (4) religion of both parents; and (5) the nature of genealogical ties, if any, between parents, maternal grandparents, and paternal grandparents.
Whenever there was a kinship, the pedigree was drawn, and the value of the inbreeding coefficient of the newborn was computed. All the parameters were coded and transferred to magnetic tape. A Data General (Eclipse) was used in tabulations and statistical analyses.
Lastly, we should mention that the hospital is located in West Beirut, an area of mostly Muslim inhabitants, the civil war having increased this trend. Also, certain mothers refused to provide their religious affiliations, and those of their husbands, which resulted in missing data in the corresponding distributions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

RESULTS

Although population-based samples provide superior material, they are very costly in human resources and time. Considering the state of insecurity prevalent in the country, and the limited funds at our disposal, it was deemed wise to rely on a sample of newborns delivered in a hospital for the purposes of the investigation. Therefore, an interview survey was carried out in the maternity ward of the American University Hospital of Beirut. All mothers delivering during December, 1981, and January and February, 1982 were questioned. The number of deliveries in the hospital at this time was around 8 to 10 per day, resulting in a sample size of 750. The data collected comprise information on: (1) age of both parents; (2) date

RELIGIOUS ENDOGAMY
In order to ascertain mating patterns with respect to religion, we calculated the joint distribution of religious affiliation of both spouses, as is shown in Table 1.
The two predominant communities are the Sunnites (45.0 per cent of the fathers) and the Shiites (36.5 per cent of the fathers). One notices a few Druze and some Christians. This religious composition reflects the geographical position of the hospital. The poor representation of the Druze has to be a result of their rural origins.
The great majority of the observations (87.8 per cent) lie on the diagonal of the table, that is, correspond to cases

of religious "homogamy." If matings were random, the expected proportion would be 33.6 per cent.
The remaining 12.2per cent of mixed marriages occur either between Christians or between Muslims (79.8 per cent of all mixed marriages, whereas the expected proportion is 64.1 per cent), or, much less frequently, between a Christian and a Muslim (20.2 per cent of all mixed marriages, whereas the expected proportion is 35.9 per cent). Concerning this latter pattern, one may note that the table is not symmetrical, since there are many more marriages between a Muslim man and a Christian woman and many less between a Muslim woman and a Christian man than would be expected if the mating process were random. This may be in part attributed to the fact that the first are licit according to the Koran, whereas the second are not.

CONSANGUINITY
The initial step in our study was an evaluation of the extent of consanguinity, as is described by the frequency of consanguineous matings. For this purpose, we recognized three classes, regarding the kinship status of the couple: no kinship; remote kinship (the genealogical tie is not traceable); and identified kinship.
Two generations are represented in the sample, that of the newborn's parents and that of his grandparents, the latter being represented by both the maternal and paternal sides. The distribution of relationship between spouses (in terms of kinship) by generation is reported in Table 2.
More than one marriage out of four is consanguineous for both generations: 26.0 per cent of all marriages among the parents, and 27.3 per cent and 21,1 per

cent, respectively, among the maternal and paternal grandparents. The lower value of this latter percentage has to be correlated with the sampling method. The mothers had to furnish information about their in-law's, and there may have been involuntary omissions, due to the ignorance of certain genealogical ties.
The proportion of consanguineous marriages seem stable from one generation to the other. A comparison of the proportions between parents and maternal grandparents provides an e value of -0.58, which is not significant.
Such rates are quite high, and, in order to quantify the amount of consan-

guinity, we have calculated the mean inbreeding coefficient of the newborns. The obtained value is F = 0.01334.
Given the current practice of consanguineous matings, one may wonder about the nature of this consanguinity. Aiming to identify the most popular patterns, we have established the distribution of the consanguineous marriages by type of kinship and generation (Table 3). No uncle-niece marriage is encountered (it is forbidden by the Koran). First-cousin marriages are predominant among the different types represented: 62.6 per cent of all consanguineous marriages among the parents, and 68.8 per

cent and 65.2 per cent, respectively, among the maternal and paternal grandparents. The proportion of first-cousin marriages seems stable from one generation to the other. A comparison of the proportions between parents and maternal grandparents provides an e value of -1.31, which is not significant.
However, the category "firstcousins" is heterogeneous, as are the others, and, in order to pursue the analysis at a finer level, we split it into the four underlying pedigrees (Table 4). Two points are noteworthy: (1) Patrilateral parallel-cousin marriage is obviously the favored practice as seen by the grandparents' distributions. Fitting a uniform distribution to the data provides chi-squares of 66.40 and 80.26 respectively, for the maternal and paternal sides, both significant at the 1 per cent level for 3 degrees of freedom. (2) In contrast, a different pattern emerges for the parents' distribution. This one is uniform. Chi-square is equal to 2.39, which is not significant for 3 degrees of freedom. Hence, the data provide evidence for some changing in the matri-

monial choices from one generation to the other.
Lastly, the nature of the data permitted us to characterize the protagonists of the consanguineous unions on socioreligious grounds. To reach this goal, we have constituted several contingency tables showing the joint distribution of kinship status of the couple (consanguinity or lack thereof) and one socioeconomic or demographic variable relative to either spouse.
In a summary, we may read the following pattern into the figures. The probability of contracting a consanguineous mating significantly diminishes when
(a) educational level increases (from 33.3 per cent consanguineous marriages when father is illiterate or did not complete primary school to 21.8 per cent when his educational level is secondary school or above);
(b) social status rises (from 29.3 per cent consanguineous marriages among unskilled workers, to 17.6 per cent among professional classes and managers of big business);
(c) age at marriage increases (mean age at marriage for husband and wife varies from, respectively, 26.74 and 20.21 when mating is consanguineous, to 29.04 and 21.20 when it is not);
(d) shifting from Muslims to Christians (respectively, 28 per cent and 13.7 per cent consanguineous marriages).

DISCUSSION
The endogamous mechanisms operating in the Lebanese population may be viewed as active at two levels: first, the religious level, and second, the family level.
Concerning the religious criteria, the present study provides evidence for a noteworthy endogamy, and an isolation of the two main groups, Christians and

Muslims, with a certain amount of migration occurring between religious communities belonging to the same group. This scheme is consistent with the results of Lalouel et al (1976). By taking into account a series of genetic markers such as ABO, Rh, haptoglobins, etc., and using the genetic distance technique, the authors identified a significant global heterogeneity between the religious communities, essentially attributable to differences between the two larger groups of Christians and Muslims. On the other hand, Serre (1976) does not find any significant pattern with respect to the HLA system. Other studies, dealing with biochemical markers as well as anthropometries, could throw light on this topic.
As regards the consanguinity which prevails in the population, an initial point has to be made about the data relative to both generations. Due to the sampling method, the parental and grandparental distributions are not independent, and this somewhat restricts the viability of a comparison. However, given the objective of this analysis, it seems to us that such a bias in no way invalidates the conclusions.
The frequency of consanguineous marriages observed in the sample, as well as the calculated mean inbreeding coefficient, correspond to the higher range described for human populations (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971; Freire-Maia, 1982). Indeed, only in certain isolates such as the Hutterites of South Dakota and Minnesota (Mange, 1964), the Dunkers of Pennsylvania (Glass, et al., 1952) and the Samaritans of Israel and Jordan (Bonne, 1963)) does the mean inbreeding coefficient attain high levels, whereas it rarely exceeds 1 per cent in the majority of the large populations. One well-known ex-

ception is the Indian population, where the high occurrence of consanguineous marriages (mainly in the south) has long provided a suitable background for population biology studies (Sibert, et al., 1979; Rao and Inbaraj, 1980; Sanghvi, 1982). Brazil (Freire-Maia, 1968) and Japan (Schull and Neel, 1965) also display substantial levels of inbreeding.
For the Lebanese population, no estimate of the mean inbreeding coefficient isyet available. The rates which we have calculated cannot be assimilated to a nationwide mean. The sample is of urban origin, and furthermore there is a religious bias, given the area which waschosen. Nevertheless, our figures lend credence to the existence of a high level of inbreeding in the population, and this inbreeding does not seem to decline from one generation to the other. Such a situation justifies investigations about the long-term effects of inbreeding on specific gene frequencies.
As to consanguineous marriage practices, first-cousin unions constitute the predominant type of mating for both generations. However, when the analysis is carried to a finer level, the two generations display different patterns. Patrilateral parallel-cousin marriage is identified as the favorite custom in the grandparental generation, whereas no overtly preferred practice is evident for the parental generation. The specific father's brother's daughter marriage has long been recognized as a common Middle Eastern practice (Khuri, 1970). Anthropologists agree that the main achievement of this type of marriage is the maintenance of family structure and property (Granqvist, 1931; Rosenfeld, 1957), given the Koranic laws of inheritance. The disappearance of this pattern of preference in the most recent generation, in favor of an equilibrium between
