In a previous paper (King and Bailar, 1968), Lutheran ministers were noted to have a very low overall mortality. The findings are consistent with other data pertaining to health of clergymen, as shown in various studies and statistics over the past two centuries (King and Bailar, 1969). However, more systematic investigations are needed, particularly comparisons between nations, to ascertain mortality and specific causes of death of the clerical profession. The present study examinesmortality among ministers of another major Protestant denomination, the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America (hereafter referred to as Episcopal clergymen), and compares the findings whenever possible with those for Church of England clergymen, England and Wales (hereafter referred toin the text asAnglican clergymen). Considering that theEpiscopal Church isanintegrated part of the Anglican Communion, this comparison between the United States and Britain could have significant implications for health studies of the clergy as a religious population, as well as a profession (King and Bailar, 1969; King 19706). Forexample, because of data limitations, no international studies have

ever been made of clerical mortality by denomination. Moreover, the results of such investigations could provide useful leads for further studies of occupationcentered health risk in the clerical profession at a cross-cultural level.
THE STUDY POPULATION
A defined population of 6,925 clergymen, nearly all white, whose names appeared in the Protestant Episcopal Church roster of January 1, 1951, was used for thestudy. The mortality experience of this population was examined for a ten-year period ending December 31, 1960. The group included, as of the beginning of thestudy, 5,990 active and 935 retired male clergymen (86.5% vs. 13.5%); of the former, 77.9% were parish ministers and 22.1% were, among other things, administrators, missionaries, teachers, military chaplains, and campus ministers. Among the 6,035 clergymen whose birthplaces were known, 87% were born in the United States; of the foreign-born, about 4 1 % were from Canada, and 13% each were from Great Britain and South and Central America.
Ninety-five per cent of the study subjects resided in theUnited States (mainly in the

The standard mortality ratio is the ratio of the number of deaths observed to the number expected, expressed as a percentage (standard population equals 100). The number of deaths from a specific cause is presented in the tables along with the standardized mortality ratio to permit readers to assess the statistical significance of differences in the SMR's.
ANGLICAN CLERGYMEN
Mortality data on Anglican clergymen are based mainly on occupational mortality statistics, England and Wales, 1949-1953 (Registrar General for England and Wales, 1957), supplemented by statistics compiled by the Central Board of Finance, the Church of England for the years 1959, 1963, 1964,

1965, and 1967 (Neuss, 1962, 1965; unpublished data).1 The age distribution of clergymen and of deaths shown in both governmental and church sources is presented in Table 2 for the years included.
The distribution of clergymen by ministerial status in 1959 was parochial ministers, 73%; nonparochial clergymen, 8%; and retired clergymen, 19% (Neuss, 1962, Table 12). The corresponding figures for 1963 were 64%, 19%, and 17%, respectively (Neuss, 1965, Table 15; "auxiliary" and otherwise
1 Church statistics on clergymen of the Church of England were based on published (shown in references under Neuss, Ronald F.) and unpublished data compiled by the Statistical Unit of the Central Board of Finance. The Statistical Unit maintains three central statistical registers, one of which deals with compilation of comprehensive statistics for publication at regular intervals "concerning the numbers, deployment and age structure of all the clergy, and also statistics of losses through death, retirement, and other causes." It is now (1965) "considered that the compilation of this register is virtually complete save for a small number of clergymen ·whose exact whereabouts cannot be traced and who may be living abroad" (Neuss, Ronald F., 1965, p. 91).

classified are included in the nonparochial group). The majority of clergymen served in the home ecclesiastical provinces of Canterbury and York, being 94% for 1959 and 91% for 1963. Considering the parochial clergymen in these two provinces alone, 81% had ever been married in 1959 (Neuss, 1962, Table 14; assistant clergymen were included in the computation of percentage). Of all parochial clergymen, 45% served in 1963 in communities of 2,999 or under and 3 % in communities of 30,000 or more (Neuss, 1965, Table 25).
Comparison of Episcopal and Anglican clergymen is restricted to Standards A and C (for mortality ratios computed for Anglican clergymen, Standard B, see King, 1970a, Tables 2A, 2B). The ratios computed from data of the Church of England apply to all combined causes only. It may be noted that because of data limitations as to the age distribution, computation of the expected number of deaths among Anglican clergymen, Standard A was based on agespecific death rates of combined five- and ten-year age classes in the standard population. For the purpose of more objective comparisons, a second set of SMR's, Standard A, was computed on the basis of

similarly combined age-classes for Episcopal ministers and is shown in parentheses in Table 3.
MAJOR FINDINGS
MORTALITY BY STANDARD A
Table 3 presents data on the observed number of deaths among Episcopal clergymen by age during the ten-year study period, and the expected number of deaths in comparison with the general white male population of the United States (Standard A). For all combined causes, the observed number of deaths in the study group was 1,387, while 1,928.98 would have occurred if mortality rates were the same as in the standard population. The standardized mortality ratio is therefore 1,387/1925.98 or 72%, indicating a 28% deficit in mortality.
Mortality ratios for broad groups of diseases are shown in the same table. Major cardiovascular-renal diseases accounted for the largest number of deaths, also with a ratio of 72%. However, for some specific causes in this group, the ratios deviated greatly from the SMR for the total (Table 4). Sampling variations could account for this finding of the specific causes with small numbers of deaths. Malignant neoplasms

all combined causes at ages 20 to 64 was much lower than that for clergymen age 20 and over (Tables 3, 4). A similarly low mortality prevailed for most specific causes of death. However, the high mortality ratio for coronary heart disease and for suicide deviated considerably from this pattern.
When compared with United States learned professionals, whose mortality has generally been known to be below average (Guralnick, 1963, No. 3, Table 2; King and Bailar, 1968, Table 7; King, 1970a, Tables 2A, 2B), the ratios for total mortality and for most specific causes of death were much more favorable for Episcopal ministers than for physicians, lawyers, and all white clergymen, but were close to or higher than those for the teaching profession. It is further noted that the mortality differentials between Episcopal clergymen and other professionals, indicated above, generally prevailed for most age-classes, as evidenced by the author's computation of age-specific mortality from all combined causes, cardiovascular-renal diseases, and malignant neoplasms.
Mortality ratios for Episcopal ministers 20 to 64 years old, computed on the basis of age-specific death rates of the total group of United States white clergymen (Standard C), showed a deficit of 33% in mortality for all combined causes (Table 5). Mortality differentials for most specific diseases deviated little from that figure, but mortality ratios for lung cancer and suicide seemed to be higher than those for the standard population.
MORTALITY COMPARISONS WITH CLERGYMEN OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
Mortality ratios for Anglican clergymen, based on governmental statistics, are shown in Table 4 along with ratios for Episcopal ministers, all of which were adjusted to the age-specific death rates of United States white males age 20 and over (Standard A). For all combined causes, mortality

among Episcopal ministers was only 75% (SMR in parentheses) of that for the standard population, compared to 106% for Anglican clergymen. A similar difference in mortality level for Episcopal (low) and Anglican (high) clergymen was shown in varying degree with respect to most specific causes, for example, arteriosclerotic and degenerative heart disease (420-422) and its subgroup, myocardial degeneration (421422), the mortality ratios being 75% vs. 101% for the combined disease group and 59% vs. 346% for the subgroup. In contrast, the mortality ratio for coronary heart disease (420)? another subgroup, was somewhat higher for Episcopal (78%) than for Anglican (65%) clergymen. Other cardiovascular diseases which showed a lower mortality ratio for Episcopal than for Anglican clergymen were strokes (330-334), 74% vs. 135%, and general arteriosclerosis, 74% vs. 102%.
For malignant neoplasms, mortality was lower for Episcopal than for Anglican clergymen. The ratios were 62% vs. 8 1 % for all cancers, 39% vs. 98% for stomach cancer, and 92% vs. 120% for cancer of the intestines. For influenza and pneumonia, the corresponding figures were 92% vs. 183%, and for hyperplasia of the prostate, 38% vs. 372%. Further, only one death from bronchitis occurred among Episcopal clergymen, while an extremely high mortality ratio of 1,540 was shown for their Anglican colleagues. For some other causes, the general patterns of mortality were reversed for Episcopal and Anglican clergymen. In addition to coronary heart disease previously noted, other disparities were shown for diabetes, suicide, leukemia, and prostatic cancer, all in favor of Anglican clergymen. However, the degree of disparity was generally smaller than for those diseases with mortality patterns favoring the Episcopal clergymen.
As with Standard A, mortality ratios for

C exceeded the ratios for Episcopal ministers for all combined causes and for most specific causes, with the exception of hypertension, diabetes, and suicide (Table 5).
It is significant to note, however, that the higher mortality ratios for all combined causes shown above for Anglican than for Episcopal clergymen were not substantiated when data of the Church of England were used (Table 6). Thus, for Anglican clergymen age 20 and over the mortality ratio decreased from 106 to 70 per cent, compared to 75 per cent for Episcopal ministers. An even lower ratio was indicated for Anglican clergymen 20 to 64 than for Anglican (30 vs. 67 percent), and the reverse was true for clergymen 65 and over (93 vs. 78 per cent). Interestingly, the disparity in mortality ratios computed from governmental and non-governmental data was further corroborated by a similar difference between the two sets of SMR's shown in the same table for British physician, i.e., the ratios based on the Medical Register data were much lower than the ones based on governmental statistics. Unfortunately, no comparable data on specific causes of death, based on Anglican clergymen who were listed in the church roster, are available for further analysis.

In examining the age-specific mortality presented in Table 7, it is clearly shown that the death rates of Anglican clergymen, computed from the governmental statistics, greatly exceeded those of Episcopal ministers for all age groups, except age 45 to 54. However, the age-specific mortality for Anglican clergymen based on the church data indicated a relatively smaller excess only for clergymen age 70 and over, while clergymen under this age had a more favorable mortality. Considering the great disparity between the two sets of age-specific mortality computed for the Anglican clergymen, one cannot but suspect reporting errors in either the governmental or church statistics, or both.
MORTALITY COMPARISONS WITH LUTHERAN CLERGYMEN
The favorable mortality among Episcopal clergymen presented in this paper generally agrees with that for Lutheran ministers reported earlier (King and Bailar, 1968). For all combined causes, mortality ratios were practically the same for the two groups of clergymen age 20 and over (Standard A: 72% vs. 73%), with a relatively higher ratio among Episcopal than among Lutheran clergymen age 20 to 64 (Standard B: 57%

vs. 44%; Standard C: 67% vs. 53%). For American clergymen in either group,, low mortality ratios were indicated for tuberculosis, stomach and lung cancers, accidents, and suicide, while mortality ratios for cancers of the intestines and prostate and perhaps for leukemia were either less depressed (Episcopal) or excessive (Lutheran). However, compared to Lutheran ministers, Episcopal clergymen had a higher mortality ratio for diabetes, while the reverse was true for cancer of the pancreas.
INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS
COMPARISON WITH UNITED STATES WHITE MALES AND TOTAL MALES WITH WORK EXPERIENCE
The mortality patterns among Episcopal clergymen, while generally confirming previous findings on the health of the clerical profession, are nevertheless difficult to explain. In keeping with the rationale which we developed for interpreting the study findings of Lutheran ministers, the extremely low mortality among Episcopal clergymen, compared to that of United States white males (Standard A) and total males with work experience (Standard B) should be attributable largely to socioeconomic

class differences. This means that members of the upper socioeconomic class (including clergymen) are generally healthier than the general male population and are therefore more likely to enter and complete college and seminary training. Further, the ministerial profession, like other learned professions (U.S. Public Health Service, 1965, Tables 5 and 7; U.S. Public Health Service, 1963, Nos. 3 and 5, Table 1) would have a favorable influence on an incumbent's health. Differences in mortality between Episcopal ministers and other United States learned professionals would be largely related to the ways of living in a given profession and their interaction with a host of other factors (for further discussion, see King, 1970a).
COMPARISON WITH UNITED STATES WHITE CLERGYMEN AND LUTHERAN MINISTERS
As with Standards A and B, subsocioeconomic class differences within the clerical profession would have contributed to a lower mortality (Standard C) among Episcopal ministers than among the total group of United States white clergymen, since the latter includes clergymen of low socioeconomic standing, many of whom are part-

time ministers. Other significant factors with varying degrees of influence could be the generally known errors in the reporting of occupation and age in census and mortality statistics and differences in marital status, ethnic origin, geographic residence, churchsanctioned behavior, or church organization, for which similar inferences may be drawn from our previous discussion on mortality differentials between United States white clergymen and Lutheran ministers (King and Bailar, 1968).
The similarity in mortality patterns for clergymen of the Episcopal and Lutheran churches would be substantially related to some of the social characteristics commonly shared by the two clerical groups, such as social origin and educational background. For example, the overall low mortality and the smaller reduction for leukemia are in keeping with the general mortality patterns of United States professionals (U.S. Public Health Service, 1963, Vol. 5, Table 1). How-

ever, the smaller reductions in mortality for cancers of the intestines and prostate (even though also common among professionals), together with the disparity in mortality ratio for diabetes (high for Episcopal) and for cancer of the pancreas (high for Lutheran) preclude immediate explanation.
COMPARISON BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN
In comparing mortality ratios between Anglican (computed from the governmental data) and Episcopal clergymen, it is interesting to note that for all combined causes and for most specific causes, differences are generally in the same direction as those between males with work experience in Britain and white males in the United States (Table 8). (For Anglo-American comparisons of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, see: Holland, 1965; Reid, 1960; Reid and Rose, 1964; Reid et al. 1965, 1967.) However, the marked difference in

mortality ratios for all combined causes for the Anglican clergymen depending on the source of information (106% from government statistics vs. 70% from church data compared to 75% for the Episcopal clergymen) suggests possible errors in reporting of age and occupation in census and mortality statistics (Registrar General for England and Wales, 1957a, p. 131), and/or registration gaps in the church data. One would also suspect that the census definition of clergymen excluded those who were not engaged in primary church activities. Such discrepancies can only be resolved through further validation of both sets of statistics.
Aside from sources of data, other speculations may be attempted as possible explanations for mortality differences between Anglican and Episcopal clergymen. One factor is the geographic distribution of clergymen. Since the majority of British vicars served, as noted earlier, in less urbanized communities, one may question whether Anglican clergymen as a group did actually experience a lower degree of occupational role stress than their American counterparts, as has generally been assumed. In this connection Emrich (1960, p. 49) commented after preaching in three British parishes that in all of them were "fine parish clergy who are doing far too much." Further studies are needed of role stress and other possible influences stemming from differences in clerical geographical distribution such as the availability and quality of medical services or general environmental risk.
Another factor may be related to marital status. As previously indicated, a higher proportion of Episcopal than Anglican parish ministers had ever been married, but the precise effect on mortality level of adjustment for marital differentials remains to be determined.
We shall consider next the possible influence of socioeconomic class, to which the

low mortality among Episcopal ministers had been attributed. In his analysis of patterns of recruitment for the Anglican ministry, Coxon (1965, 1967) suggested that between 1870 and the 1960's the "normal" group of graduates ordained each year has gone through a period of attrition, complemented by the growth of the "late" group. The characteristics (including among others, presumably, personal health, or so this author would conjecture) of the latter compared to the former are much more typical of the general population. The possible influence, if any, of such a transition on the health of Anglican clergymen as a group remains to be shown. No comparable data are available for the trends in social origin among Episcopal clergymen.
Finally, a word is in order on some of the common characteristics of clergymen of the Anglican Communion which would have bearing on health. For example, although the use of tobacco and liquor is permitted for Episcopal and Anglican clergymen, little is known about differences in kind and extent of such consumption. Further, both groups of clergymen are appointed with perpetual tenure (known as "parson's freehold" in Britain) and may be removed only with difficulty for such reasons as spectacular misbehavior or eccentricities in teaching (which were said to be especially cherished by the British vicars, according to Hamblin, 1965). Since an Anglican parochial clergyman serves an average number of about 7 years in the same parish (Neuss, 1962, Table 24; no comparable data available for Episcopal clergymen), it would be interesting to conduct a study of the health implications of such a tenure system in a "congregational" type of church organization (Smith, 1953; Rodehaver and Smith, 1951).
CONCLUSIONS
Several findings are interesting and significant, one of which concerns some of the

176

disease-specific mortality differences between clergymen of the Anglican Communion residing in Britain and those in the United States such as, on the one hand, arteriosclerotic and degenerative heart disease, strokes, cancers of the stomach and intestines, and hyperplasia of the prostate (high for Anglican) and on the other hand, diabetes, suicide, leukemia, and prostatic cancer (high for Episcopal). This points to the need for gaining better insight into the dissimilar health risks of the ministerial profession in relation to different sociocultural and geographic settings.
Another finding is that the mortality patterns of Episcopal clergymen are quite similar to those of Lutheran ministers reported earlier. While this seems to reflect the common socioeconomic standing shared by the two ministerial groups, it nevertheless requires further substantiation, particularly, for example, the commonly shared smaller reductions in mortality for cancers of the intestines and prostate and for leukemia, as well as certain disease-specific mortality differences such as diabetes (higher for Episcopal than for Lutheran) and cancer of the pancreas (higher for Lutheran than for Episcopal). It would be especially rewarding to compare the mortality patterns of Episcopal and Lutheran ministers with the study findings of clerical populations with a different social background.
The findings from our study of a more favorable mortality among the clerical than among the general population, while being consistent with those previously reported, necessitate detailed ascertainment and exploration of new clues through further studies of denominations at both national and cross-national levels.

A further finding pertains to the accuracy of occupational mortality statistics on the clerical profession (and possibly other learned professions as well), for example, the disparity between mortality ratios computed from thegovernmental data and those based on church statistics. This suggests the need for a critical evaluation of the census and mortality statistics for the clerical and other learned professions, as well as a systematic documentation of more adequate data for the church and professional organizations.
Finally, but not least in significance, it seems appropriate on the basis of the results obtained from studies of the clergy as a religious population to conduct comprehensive inquiries of occupation-centered health risks of the clerical profession and to compare the findings with those of other learned professions, preferably in accordance with a conceptual study scheme presented elsewhere (King, 1966,1970a, 19706).
