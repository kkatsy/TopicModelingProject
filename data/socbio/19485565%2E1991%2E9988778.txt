ABSTRACT: Ahlburg (1983, 1986) tested a simple version of Easterlin's relative-cohort-size model of fertility on the basis of U.S. and Canadian post-war data. His conclusion was that the Easterlin model fits the data very well and can therefore be used for calculating forecasts. However, the model he estimated is oversimplified. In this paper an alternative specification is presented. The model is applied to Dutch fertility data. The Easterlin effect is found to affect the movement of births in the Netherlands during the period 1950-85, but a declining long-term trend in average family size proves far more important in explaining post-war births. The model forecasts a rise of births until 2000.

Easterlin (1961, 1973, 1976) postulates that fertility is determined by relative income, i.e., by the ratio of income of families in the childbearing ages to their expected income. The latter depends on the standard of living their parents enjoyed when they were reared. If it is assumed that small generations perform better on the labor market and earn higher incomes than large generations, relative income is determined by relative cohort size. Consequently fertility is related to cohort size.
This model may be attractive to population forecasters as it implies that future births are a function of past births. Hence, if the model is valid, births can be forecast without it being necessary to forecast explanatory variablesfirst.
Ahlburg (1983, 1986) applies a simple version of this model to U.S. and Canadian live births. This paper argues that his specification is oversimplified and presents an alternative specification which is applied to Dutch fertility data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
AHLBURG'S TESTOF
SAMUELSON'S MODEL
Ahlburg (1983) estimates the relative-cohort-size model for U.S. total live births in the period 1949 to 1978. Ahlburg (1986) applies the same model to Canadian data for the period 1941 to 1979. In both cases Ahlburg concludes that the model fits the data very well. Assuming the model to be valid, he calculates long-term forecasts of births.
There is, however, reason to doubt the validity of Ahlburg's specification. Hence his "satisfactory" empirical results do not necessarily support Easterlin's theory. As Ahlburg notes, his model is based on a specification by Samuelson (1976). However, Samuelson (p. 244) points out that hisspecification is an "oversimplified version" of the Easterlin theory. He does not aim to describe actual developments: "the formulation is illustrative only. "

The specification used by Ahlburg boils down to the assumption that all children of women of a given generation are born in the same year. It goes without saying that this model is oversimplified.
Ahlburg (1983) distinguishes two age groups: Ni(t), the number of persons in the prime childbearing stage of life; N2(t), the number of those some twenty years older who are in the last years of childbearing. Using Ahlburg's notation, we write the model as follows:

= flPlB(t-l) + f2PlP2B(t-2),

(1)

where f\, f2 are age-specific fertility rates; p\, p2 are fractions of survivors; B{i) is the number of births in period t.
Easterlin's model is specified as

h =h(RY) RY = k (N1/N2)

(2) (3)

with/! an inclining function of RY and RY a declining function of N\ IN2, where RY is relative income. Substitution of (2) and (3) in (1) gives

B(t) = plf1[p1B(t-l)/PlP2B(t-2)] f2PlP2B(t-2)

a2B(t-2).

(4)

Subsequently Ahlburg specifies the equation to be estimated as

B, = axB\.xIBu2 + a2B,2 + et, (5)

where e, is a random disturbance term. This specification implies that Ahlburg implicitly assumes a linear relationship between/1 and N\IN2. However, as fertility rates cannot be negative, a term such as a0B,_i is lacking. Moreover, in presenting the estimation results, Ahlburg introduces a constant term from nowhere.

From the estimation results presented in Ahlburg (1983), it appears that B¡is the total number of live births in a single year. The lag t-l is twenty years and t-2 is forty years. Thus, according to Model (5), total births in year / only depend on total births 20 and 40 years before. Not very surprisingly, Ahlburg finds that the model generates a cycle of 40 years. Finally, it should be noted that Ahlburg ignores changes in the timing of fertility.
In view of these remarks, it can be questioned whether the estimated values of the coefficients of (5) provide any information at all with respect to the validity of the Easterlin hypothesis.

ALTERNATIVE SPECIFICATION

On the basis of more realistic assumptions, an alternative specification can be derived. The number of births in a given year can be related to past births by

B, --

h-i <?<,'

(6)

where B, = number of births in year I;
fitt = age-specific fertility rate for age / in year t;

q¡,t =

(7)

where v,.¡ = fraction of births in t-i of female sex;p,)( = fraction of women born in {t-i)surviving after i years. As the external migration surplus in the Netherlands was relatively small compared to births during the examined period, it is not included in the model.
The age-specific fertility rates in a given year are determined by two factors, completed fertility of cohorts and its timing:

fi,t = It-iLt-ii,

(8)

where /,.,· = completed fertility of

women born in t-i;L,.¡j = fraction of total fertility of those women at age i. Completed fertility of women born in t-i can be distinguished according to the age of their mothers:

/,, = 2K,,/,-,-y,

(9)

where .K,.^ = fraction ofwomen born in t-i whose mothers were born int-i-j; I,.ij = completed fertility of women born in t-1whose mothers were born in
t-i-j.
The Easterlin theory assumes that completed fertility of a given cohort is inversely related to the ratio of the size of that cohort to that of their parents. If, in addition, it is assumed that societal developments such assecularization, urbanization, and emancipation lead to a declining long-run trend of the fertility level that is independent of relative cohort size, the following specification results:

H / = a B,i/Bt.H +

(10)

where thelong-run trend is described by a polynomial with coefficients ys- The Easterlin hypothesis implies that a < 0. A falling linear trend is described by 7o> 0 and yi <0.
Substitution of (8), (9)and (10)in(6) yields

B, = frïilBinLwÇijKuj/Bw)] + SJÔ^iiO-O^L,,,,}], (11)

where ßi = aq and 8, = ysq. As both the sex ratio at birth and the mortality quotients at younger ages hardly vary, q¡t is assumed constant: q¡¡t = q. Since

Kt.¡J=fj¡t.iBt.HqlB,.¡,

(12)

(11) canbe rewritten as

Bt=ßli(B,iLtVTFRt.i) +

Zslbsliit-iyB^Uij],

(13)

where TFR,.¡ = 2^,,.,-and ß = faq.

Given this specification, testing the Easterlin hypothesis amounts to answering the question whether the coefficientß is negative.
ASSUMPTIONS
Model (13) is estimated for the period 1950-85 on thebasis of Dutch data. As the minimum and maximum childbearing ages determine the time lags in the model and hence the length of the estimation period, the analysis is restricted to fertility between ages 20 and 35.
Data for the total fertility rate(TFR) are available from 1936onward. However, figures since 1915 are needed. Estimates for the period 1915-35 areobtained by dividing total births into five-years age groups of the mother based on the age-specific data of1936. These numbers of births are subsequently related to the numbers of women in the various age categories. The sensitivity of theempirical resultsto this procedure will be discussed below. As total fertility at age 35is not yetobserved for women born after 1950,it is not yetknown towhich fractions of total fertility the already observed agespecific fertility rates of these women correspond. Estimates are obtained from the National Population Forecasts of 1986of the Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics. The sensitivity of the results to this choice will be examined below.
For describing the long-run trend in family size, weusealinear function. The effect on the outcomes of choosing another specification will be discussed. If the residuals exhibit autocorrelation, an ARMA-model for the disturbance term is specified. The coefficients of this model are estimated simultaneously with the other coefficients.

RESULTS
The estimated coefficients of model (13) are
ß = -0.2180 8o= 2.1523 8i =-0.0159 (0.0379) (0.1224) (0.0008)
9 i = 0.5214 62= 0.7016 R2 = 0.944 (0.1641) (0.1650)
where 6i and 02 are moving-average coefficients of the ARMA-model and R2 is the correlation coefficient adjusted for degrees of freedom. The estimated standard errors are shown in parenthesis. The estimated value of ß is negative and thus supports the Easterlin hypothesis. If the Easterlin effect is assumed to be nonexistent, i.e., if ß = 0, the model explains 86per cent of the variance in total births. The partial correlation coefficient of the Easterlin effect equals 0.57. Therefore, it can be concluded that although according to the examined specification the Easterlin effect exists--or at least is not rejected by the data--it can only explain a relatively small part of the post-war movement of births compared with the long-term trend.
In Table 1 and Figure 1, projections of total births up to 20 years ahead are shown. Births are roughly constant until the mid 1990's and then start to decline. However, in view of the relatively poor fitof the model in recent years, one may question the plausibility of these forecasts. The underestimates for recent years are due to the linear specification of the long-term trend of completed fertility. It might seem more plausible to assume that the decline of completed fertility for recent cohorts--given the already low level of total fertility--is smaller than for older cohorts.
If the trend is described by a secondor third-degree polynomial, the fit of the

model clearly improves, especially in recent years. The adjusted correlation coefficients are 0.982 and 0.986 respectively. The coefficient representing the Easterlin effect is hardly affected. A problem in using polynomials of higher degree is, however, that they tend to extreme out-of-sample projections.
Another possibility for describing the trend is to use a linear spline function. This implies that the examined period is divided into subperiods to which linear trends with different slopes apply. The last term of (13) changes into

{(t-i-tk)DkB,,Lt,j],

(14)

where Dk = 0 if t-i ^ tk and Dk = 1 if t-i>tk.
If birth cohort 1945 is chosen as turn-
ing point, i.e., if it is assumed that the
slope of the trend in completed fertility
of cohorts after 1945 differs from that of

earlier cohorts, the fit of the model clearly improves (see Table 2 and Figure 2).

The residuals do not exhibit autocorrelation. Without the Easterlin effect, the model explains 90 per cent of the variance of total births. The partial correlation coefficient of the Easterlin effect is 0.86. If, instead of cohort 1945, a later cohort is selected as turning point, the fit of the model deteriorates slightly. The projections show an increase of total births until 2000. In the absence of the Easterlin effect, the model forecasts a stabilization of births until the mid 1990's, after which a decline follows.

calculating the forecasts, information on the timing pattern of fertility of recent cohorts is obtained from the National Population Forecasts of 1986. According to this forecast there is a shift in fertility from young ages to ages around thirty. If, instead, one would assume that the timing pattern of fertility after birth cohort 1955 does not change, which implies that the observed decline of fertility at young ages would not be caught up in later years, total births would only rise to a level of 192,000 in the year 2000.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Estimation of the model for the period 1950-85 requires an assumption on the movement of the TFR in the period 1915-35. In order to examine how sensitive the outcomes are to this assumption, we make an alternative estimate of the TFR on the basis of the ratio of the TFR to total births. This ratio changes gradually through time. The movement of this ratio in the period 1936-62 can be described reasonably accurately by a linear trend (R2 = 0.96). Extrapolation of this trend back to 1915 yields an alternative estimate of the TFR which is considerably lower than the estimate discussed before. Nevertheless, using this alternative estimate does not cause the outcomes to change strongly. The fit of the model stays the same: R2 = 0.983. The estimated value of ß becomes -0.3430 (with standard error 0.0238).
Another assumption concerns the timing of fertility of recent cohorts. In-

stead of using outcomes of the National Population Forecasts of 1986, we can assume that the timing pattern of fertility does not change after birth cohort 1955. In that case the estimated value of ß becomes -0.2330 (with standard error 0.0155).
Thus, the conclusion that the Easterlin hypothesis is not rejected by the data is not particularly sensitive to the assumptions underlying the estimation of the model.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Under the assumption that the change of completed fertility of successive cohorts is determined by a combination of a linear trend and relative cohort size (the Easterlin effect), the movement of total births in the Netherlands in the period 1950-85 can be described reasonably accurately. The long-run trend plays by far the more important role, but the Easterlin effect increases the explanatory power of the model.
The Easterlin hypothesis cannot be rejected on the basis of the specification used in this paper. However, this is not tantamount to saying that the Easterlin theory is true, as only one possible specification at an aggregate level is tested for a limited period of time.
