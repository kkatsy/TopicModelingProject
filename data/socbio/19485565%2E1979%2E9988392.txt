ABSTRACT: The negative correlation between annual homicide and fertility rates reported by Lyster (1974) is confirmed by statistical analysis, which is extended to show that the correlation is largely confined to the post-World-War-II years and holds for whites and nonwhites in nearly equal degree. Data are shown to support the hypothesis that homicide and fertility rates are responding to variations in psychological stress among young adults associated with swings in relative cohort size, the proportion of those age15-29 to those age 30-64. It is suggested that periods of increase in the relative number of young men weakens their labor market position, and the result is to increase psychological stress, to discourage traditional role fulfillment such as family building, and to encourage antisocial behavior, indexed here by the homicide rate.

lation does not hold or holds only weakly in theearlier period.
In support of this hypothesis, we present inlines eand/of Table 1thecorrelations with relative cohort size of the homicide rate and fertility rate. Note the very high correlations in the post-WorldWar-II period (Col. 4) consistent withour expectations, in contrast to the preWorld-War-II correlations, which are either insignificant (homicide) or in the wrong direction (fertility).2
The inverse relation between homicide and fertility appears to be paralleled bya similar inverse relation between suicide

and fertility in the period since the 1930's, which has been pointed out by Martin O'Connell (1975) and explained by him along lines similar to ours. Clearly the suicide andfertility relationship buttresses the present viewpoint and suggests the need for broader investigation into the economic and social manifestations of cohort size.
2In the case of homicide, if data relating specifically to young males (15-24) rather than the population as a whole are used, the correlation coefficient in Col. 4 is virtually identical (0.97).The problem with data by age, however, isthat they refer to victims rather than perpetrators of murder.
