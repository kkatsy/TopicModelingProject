ABSTRACT:In this paper we use data from the 1 Per Cent Sample of the 1990 Census of China to calculate sex ratios for the Chinese provinces that are specific not only to parity, but also to the sex composition of previously-born children. We analyze the degree of relationship among and between the SRB's and then consider the phenomenon of son preference. We find the variation in sex ratios at birth among the Chinese provinces is related in an important way to variation among the provinces in the degree of son preference. Our analysis shows abnormally high SRB's in most of the provinces of China, especially at parities 2 and higher when the prior births were daughters. Other societies, namely Taiwan and South Korea, with rapid fertility decline and strong son preference also manifest abnormally high SRB's at parities beyond the first.

The true sex ratio at birth (SRB) is a near biological universal. Countries with reliable demographic data, often developed countries, consistently report SRB's of around 104 to 107 male births for every 100 female births (Chahnazarian, 1991, p. 214). Some researchers have found that paternal age and birth order influence the SRB (younger fathers produce more males, and lower order births have higher SRB's), but these effects seem to be slight (Chahnazarian, 1991, p. 230), and some studies have reported no such differences. In their study of Sweden and twelve other industrialized nations, for example, Johansson and Nygren (1991) found that the SRB "does not vary significantly between regions, with parity, or by age of mother," and that the larger the birth cohort, the smaller the variation (1991, p. 16). When the SRB is above or below the biological average range of 104-107, other factors, often sociological, such as son preference, may override the biological forces, biasing upwards the SRB's. In this paper, our major objective

is to examine the association between son preference and the sex ratio at birth among the provinces of the People's Republic of China.
According to Zeng and his associates (1993, p. 283) the SRB in China "was very close to 106 in most years in the 1960's and 1970's." We plot in Figure 1 the values of the SRB from 1960 to 1989 for all parities combined, and for the specific parities of one, two, and three. During the past decade or so, the total SRB has been steadily increasing, reaching a value of 114 in 1989 (see the upper left panel of Figure 1). Moreover, the SRB's in China for parities above one are considerably higher than the values in 1989 of 114 reported for all births, or of 105 reported for parity-one births. To illustrate, the SRB for parities 2 and 3 for the year 1989 are 121 and 125, respectively; only the SRB values for parity 1 are in the normal range for most years (see the other three panels of the figure). What is happening in China that is producing such abnormally high SRB's for parities

above one? Or to put the question in another way, what has become of the missing baby girls?
To date, several answers to the above questions have been advanced. Some have argued that the increase in the reported sex ratios at birth in China is mainly due to female infanticide, or to prenatal sex identification followed by gender-specific induced abortion, or to the underreporting of female births (Hull, 1990), or to female adoption, that is, baby girls, more so than baby boys, being given away (Johansson and Nygren, 1991). Zeng and associates (1993) have written that the sex-differential in the underreporting of births, along with sex selective abortion, explain almost all of the recent increase in the reported sex ratio at birth in China. However, few of the explanations proposed to date have entertained the influence of a less proximate structural influence such as son preference. We attempt to address this void in our paper.
Prior analyses of the SRB in China have usually treated China as a single entity and have examined SRB's for the country as a whole. They have tended to pay little if any attention to variation in the overall SRB and in the parity-specific SRB's among the provinces of China. Also, they have not tended to focus much on sex-specific/ parity-specific SRB's among the provinces. Our paper will also attempt to take into account this empirical shortcoming of previous investigations.
In this paper we use data from the 1 Per Cent Sample of the 1990 Census of China and calculate sex ratios for 1990 for the Chinese provinces that are specific not only to parity, but also to the sex composition of previously-born children. The empirical part of our paper begins with a province-level description of such a schedule of parity-specific SRB's. We

analyze the degree of relationship among and between the SRB's. We then consider the phenomenon of son preference and suggest various measurement strategies, using data from the Two-per-thousand Fertility and Contraception Survey conducted in 1988 by China's State Family Planning Commission (State Family Planning Commission of China, 1990). We then relate our measures of son preference to the schedule of parity- and sex-specific SRB's.
Our analysis is not in any way a comprehensive study of the sex ratio at birth in China. It is meant to focus empirically only on the dynamics of the relationship between son preference and the SRB. This somewhat straightforward relationship needs next to be integrated into the larger theoretical body of work pertaining to modernization and gender. We mention some of these linkages in our literature review and look briefly at some of the empirical associations between modernization, gender issues, and son preference. But these are cursory and not the principal subject of this paper. A broader and fuller consideration of these issues occupies our attention in work currently underway.
In the next sections we ask first what is known about the sex ratio at birth, and then examine the phenomenon among China's provinces. We then address the phenomenon of son preference, both conceptually and methodologically. Finally, we look empirically at the relationship between son preference and the sex ratio at birth.

literature and empirical data indicate the following:
1.--The reported SRB in China has been steadily increasing since the 1980's. Statistics indicate that the reported SRB for China was normal and close to 106 in most years of the 1960's and 1970's. After 1980, it increased, to 107.4 in 1980, and to 108.5 in 1984; it reached 111.4 in 1985, 112.3 in 1986, and 113.8 in 1989 (see Figure 1; also see Gu and Li, 1994).
2.--The sex ratios at birth in China for parities above one have been considerably higher than normal (Zeng et al., 1993). Studies have shown that the SRB by birth order should be about the same as the true SRB at around 106 or even lower, as the birth order increases (Xu and Guo, 1991). According to data from the 1988 Two-per-thousand Fertility and Contraception Survey (State Family Planning Commission of China, 1990), after 1980 the SRB of parity 1 was about normal, but the SRB's of parity 3 and above were higher than normal. After 1984, the SRB's of parity 2 and above were higher than normal. After 1984, the SRB's of parity 2 and above were higher than normal and were positively correlated with birth order, That is, the higher the birth order, the higher the sex ratio (Gao, 1993). It is believed that these high sex ratios reflect the people's desire to attain a certain number of sons when they have fewer children. The data we chart in Figure 1 (bottom two panels) indicate very clearly that SRB's for parities above one are considerably higher than normal.
3.--Rural unplanned births tend to be characterized by higher sex ratios than those of planned births and urban births (Xu, 1993). Data from the 1988 Two-perthousand Fertility and Contraception Survey showed that from 1980 to 1987, the

SRB's in urban areas were generally normal, except in 1982; however, in rural areas, the sex ratios increased after 1983. According to Xu, the rising sex ratio in China during 1985-87 was mainly due to the increase in the sex ratios in rural areas. Furthermore, the range of sex ratios for planned births was roughly in the normal range (102-109), but the range of sex ratios for unplanned births was higher (108-117). It would appear that the rise in sex ratios in the 1980's was due in large part to the abnormal sex ratios for unplanned births in rural areas.
4.--Population policy in China, along with traditional son preference, may well be among the major influences behind the rise in the sex ratio at birth in the 1980's. Using data from the 1985 China In-depth Fertility Survey, Wen suggested that the influences of son preference and population policy were reflected in the high and rising overall SRB and the increasing sex ratios with parity (Wen, 1993). Li and Cooney used data from the Two-perthousand Fertility and Contraception Survey to analyze whether son preference affected compliance with China's one-child policy. They found that the effect of son preference on compliance does not appear to be very much influenced by government control and continued to be a factor discouraging compliance with the one-child policy (Li and Cooney 1993).
In countries outside China, high reported sex ratios at birth are not out of the ordinary (Eng and Smith, 1976; Coale and Banister, 1994). Indeed, the countries now experiencing high SRB's are often the same ones that recorded high sex ratios during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Where a strong preference for sons over daughters is already part of the culture, SRB's tend to be higher.

However, high SRB's are not found in all developing countries experiencing fertility reductions. For example, the SRB's of most South American countries have been dropping since the late 1970's (Feitosa and Krieger, 1992). We have examined data in the 1988 Demographic Yearbook (United Nations, 1990) and found that the sex ratio at age zero (which will include infant mortality up to about one year, hence slightly underestimating the SRB) is abnormal in some African and Asian countries such as Hong Kong, South Korea, and Mauritania, but normal in most of Latin America, North America, and Europe.
Recently, in Korea, in China, and in Taiwan, as fertility has declined, the SRB's of higher parities have risen (Park and Cho, 1995; Park, 1994; Chang, 1994). Arnold has reported that "sex preferences are not equally important at all parities" (Arnold, 1985, p. 281). In the Republic of Korea, the SRB of the last born child is usually the highest. A "stopping rule" seems to affect fertility choices in that when the desired number of sons has been born, fertility is terminated (Park, 1983, p. 336). However, it has also been noted that this rise in the sex ratio of the last-born child "should be a combined consequence of the son-preferring stopping rule and female-selective abortion and other manipulations" (Park, 1994, p. 9).
We know, and have already mentioned, the general causes for the high reported sex ratios at birth in China and the Republic of Korea. They are sex-selective abortion, underreporting of female babies (female infants either living with their own families or informally adopted to others and not recorded as live births), a stopping rule in which fertility is terminated when a high number of sons is achieved,

and, in a few cases, infanticide (Park, 1983; Hull, 1990; Johansson and Nygren, 1991; Zeng et al., 1993). However, we need to look beyond these intermediate causes of high sex ratios. Son preference, along with socioeconomic development and gender inequality, among other factors, would appear to interact to produce these high sex ratios at birth.
SRB's vary to a significant degree according to the level of development both within and among countries. Rising SRB's seem to be particularly evident in a select group of developing or newly developed nations (Li, 1986; Bae, 1991). Indeed, Gu has observed that with rapid fertility decline, as in the case of both South Korea and China, "sociocultural factors [such as son preference] will be . . . more influential than economic" ones, at least for a time (Gu, 1994, p. 4). And Das Gupta has noted that "in societies which show no particular preference for children of either sex, we would not expect to find increased gender bias with fertility decline. It is in societies which show a preference for boys that we would expect to find a female disadvantage in survival, and to find this disadvantage sharpened by fertility decline" (Das Gupta, 1994, p. 3). However, "sonpreference also tends to diminish in response to economic development" (Warren, 1985, p. 14). As sons become less necessary for labor and security with increasing development, the socioeconomic factors should begin to ease the abnormality in birth ratios and the inequalities throughout the lifespan.
The desire for many sons has been an integral part of Asian (and many other) societies for centuries. This desire is still alive and well in many of those societies. In most countries of the world today (in-

eluding developed countries), couples usually want their first birth to be a son. The preference for sons in "South Korea and Taiwan is both pervasive and extreme [and] Chinese populations . . . typically exhibit high levels of son preference as well" (Arnold and Liu, 1986, p. 493). And in Bangladesh, South Korea, and Nepal, more than 95 per cent of women with both a son and daughter who want another child want that child to be a boy. Arnold and Liu have suggested that son preference in China is the result of "deeply rooted Confucian traditions" and sons are desired for the purpose of "family propagation, old-age security, the provision of labor, and the performance of ancestral rites" (1986, p. 492; see also Greenhalgh and Li, 1995).
Studies of Latin America have shown that son preference there is much less extreme and, in some cases, nonexistent (Arnold and Liu, 1986; Cleland and Scott, 1987). In fact, it seems that many Latin American women are more concerned about achieving a certain number of children than with the sex composition of the children (United Nations, 1982, p. 63). Interestingly, those countries with among the strongest family planning programs are the ones with the highest levels of son preference (i.e., China, Taiwan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong) (Birdsall, 1985).
There has been some research linking son preference with high SRB's. The existence of sex preference by itself, however, is not sufficient to influence fertility and the sex ratio at birth "unless technologies that translate the preference to fertility modification are applied" (Park, 1994, p. 21). But the evidence indicates that where such technologies as contraception, the diagnosis of the sex of the fetus, and abortion, are present and avail-

able, sex preference is likely to affect fertility behavior. For example, although we know that males have higher death rates than females, countries with high son preference often report higher female than male mortality. Langford (1984) noted that from 1950 to 1975, female life expectancy was lower than that for males in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Papua New Guinea, countries with high levels of son preference. When India experienced outbreaks of famine, plague, and malaria early in this century, the sex ratio went up (Mitra, 1979). This increase appears to be due to differential access of females and males to food and medical care (see also Bumiller, 1990).
Along with son preference and, indeed, related to son preference, is the low status of women often found in many countries. In a national survey by the AllChina Women's Federation in 1990, the existence of gender inequality was affirmed by male and female respondents. The inequality was observed in such matters as employment, school admission, and inheritance (Gu, 1994, p. 21). In terms of traditional measures of power, women are still at a disadvantage in spite of gains that have been made. Women's level of education has been found to influence fertility and contraceptive use (Vlassoff, 1991; DeSilva, 1992). Again, little research directly links high SRB's with status indicators. However, since both fertility level and contraceptive use have been shown to be closely connected with the current state of sex ratios, it is reasonable to suggest that educational levels and other status indicators are influencing SRB's. Mitra proposed that the rising sex ratios at birth in India are related to low education for women, limitations on employment and wages due to

childbirth, higher female mortality, and women's lower contribution in "cash terms" to the household (Mitra, 1979, p. 29). In many of the countries we have considered (e.g., India, Bangladesh, China, Pakistan), women attain far less education than men and thus perform more of the low-status jobs. In India (and elsewhere) a woman's value is often stipulated in terms of how many sons she has born (Mitra, 1979). Along these lines, Bumiller writes about the popular Sanskrit blessing given to Hindu women at the time of their weddings, "May you be the mother of a hundred sons" (1990, p. 10). Gu notes that Chinese women from both urban and rural areas believe they will be at risk of discrimination and insult if they do not produce a male child (Gu, 1994). We turn now to our empirical results regarding the sex ratio at birth.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE SEX RATIO AT BIRTH: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM CHINA
As noted above, we use data from the 1 Per Cent Sample of the 1990 Census of China (State Statistical Bureau, 1992) pertaining to births born to women in the 12 months prior to the date of the census, July 1, 1990, to determine the sex ratios; and we use data on the number and sex distribution of children ever born to the women to determine the parity levels and sex composition of the SRB's. For the twenty-nine provinces of China in 1990 (Tibet is excluded because complete data are not available), we have calculated a schedule of nine SRB's that are specific not only to parity, but also to the sex composition of previously-born children, as follows:

(1.) total SRB;
(2.) SRB for parity 1;
(3.) SRB for parity 2;
(4.) SRB for parity 1 where the preceding birth was a male;
(5.) SRB for parity 2 where the preceding birth was a female;
(6.) SRB for parity 3;
(7.) SRB for parity 3 where the preceding births were both males;
(8.) SRB for parity 3 where the preceding births were male and female; and
(9.) SRB for parity 3 where the preceding births were both females.
Table 1 presents this schedule of SRB's for the 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities (hereafter we refer to all 29 areas as provinces) of China in 1990. We have asterisked those SRB's that were calculated with numerators and/or denominators of less than 50 births (which in the full population would represent less than 5,000 births, since we are using a 1 per cent sample of census records). Those SRB's are excluded from further analysis.
We look now at the variation in the SRB's; the bottom panel of Table 2 presents descriptive data only for those SRB's that have both numerators and denominators of at least 50 births. The total SRB's (sr-t) have an average value across the provinces of 113, and range from a low of 103 in Qinghai to a high of 124 in Henan. The lowest SRB's, for the most part, are for first parity births (sr-pl); the mean is 106, and they range from a low of 97 in Guizhou to a high of 113 in Shanghai. The highest SRB's are for third parity births where the first two births were females (sr-p3g); the average value is 208 (among the 23 provinces used to measure it, six provinces, namely, Beijing, Tianjin,

Shanghai, Hainan, Qinghai, and Ningxia, were excluded because their SRB's for this parity and sex composition had numerators and/or denominators of less than 50 births); this SRB ranges from a low of 113 in Xinjiang to a high of 321 in Jiangsu.
An examination of the SRB's by parity, without regard to sex composition, indicates that they increase with increasing parity. As noted, the SRB for parity 1 (srpl) has an average value of 106, and a range of 97 to 113; the SRB for parity 2 (sr-p2) has an average value of 120, and a range of 96 (Qinghai) to 148 (Zhejiang); the SRB for parity 3 (sr-p3) has an average value of 130, and a range of 103 to 193.
When we examine the parity 3 SRB's according to the sex composition of prior births, the lowest mean value is for the SRB for parity 3 where the first two births were males, an average SRB of 81; the highest is for the SRB where the first two births were females, an average SRB of 208; the SRB for parity 3 where the first two births were mixed falls between these two extremes, with a mean SRB of 112. Similarly, an examination of parity 2 SRB's according to the sex of the prior birth indicates that the lowest mean value is for SRB's where the prior birth was male, a mean of 103, and the highest average value is for SRB's where the prior birth was a girl, a mean value of 139.
These descriptive data on parity- and sex-specific SRB's seem to indicate the influence on them of son preference.
The top panel of Table 2 is a matrix of zero-order correlation coefficients among the 36 (or [9 * 8]/2) pairs of SRB's. These are pair-wise correlation coefficients; that is, each correlation has been calculated only for those provinces with SRB's of at least 50 births in the numera-

tor and denominator. For instance, all 29 provinces are used in the correlations relating the total SRB with the SRB for parity 1 and the SRB for parity 2. But any correlations involving the SRB for parity 3 where the first two births were girls will include no more than 23 provinces, and any correlations involving the SRB for parity 3 where the first two births were boys will include no more than 18 provinces. (See Table 1 for an indication of [the asterisked] provinces that were excluded from the correlation analysis.)
Several points about the variability in SRB's among the provinces may be made with the correlation data in Table 2. In the first place, knowledge of the total sex ratio is at best a fair predictor of the SRB's at higher parities. Its correlation with the SRB for parity 2 is 0.63, hence accounting for about 40 per cent (r2) of its variability. It has a correlation of 0.41 (r2 = 0.17) with the SRB for parity 1, and a correlation of 0.31 (r2 = 0.10) with the SRB for parity 3.
Second, the parity-specific SRB's are better predictors of the SRB's at that parity where prior births were girls than at that parity where prior births were boys. To illustrate, among the provinces in 1990, the SRB for parity 2 has a correlation of 0.88 with the SRB for parity 2 where the prior birth was a girl, versus a correlation of 0.26 with the SRB for parity 2 where the prior birth was a boy. In a similar vein, the SRB for parity 3 has a correlation of 0.51 with the SRB for parity 3 where the prior births were girls, versus instead a correlation of -0.01 with the SRB for parity 3 where the prior births were boys.
Third, we noted already that the SRB's at parity 1 are much more within the normal range of SRB's than the sex

66

ratios of higher parities. Thus, the SRB at parity 1 is much less related with the SRB of higher parities than are these SRB's with each other. Observe the correlations of the SRB for parity 1 with the SRB's for parity 2 and for parity 3 of 0.21 and 0.05, respectively. Contrast these correlations with that of 0.57 between the SRB's for parity 2 and parity 3.
Fourth, following somewhat from the preceding, the SRB's for parities where the prior births were girls are more highly associated with each other than are the SRB's for parities where the prior births were boys. Witness the correlation of 0.80 between the SRB's for parity 2 where the prior birth was a girl with the SRB's for parity 3 where the prior births were girls. Compare this correlation with that of 0.31 between SRB's for parity 2 where the prior birth was a boy and SRB's for parity 3 where the prior births were boys.
Finally, again following somewhat the findings about the sex-specific relationships shown in the preceding sections, the associations between parity 2 and parity 3 SRB's where the prior births were males in one case and females in the other are negative. Observe the correlation of -0.24 between SRB's of parity 2 where the prior birth was a boy and SRB's of parity 3 where the prior births were girls. Witness also the correlation of -0.46 between SRB's of parity 3 where the prior births were boys and SRB's of parity 2 where the prior birth was a girl.
The relationships reported in the top panel of Table 2 indicate a tendency for the SRB's of the higher parities to be more closely related to one another than to those of parity 1. This finding owes in part to the fact that the SRB's at parity 1 are more within the normal range of sex

ratios, and the SRB's at parities 2 and 3 are not. These correlations also inform us that the SRB's of the 2nd and 3rd parities where the prior births were females are much more closely associated than are the SRB's of the 2nd and 3rd parities where the prior births were males. This finding owes in part to the fact that the SRB's where the prior births were females are much more uniformly higher than they are where the prior births were males; and this holds for SRB's of parity 2 and parity 3. The associations reported in Table 2 give further support to the earlier observation gleaned from the descriptive data regarding the influence of son preference on the sex ratio at birth. We turn now to a specific examination of this relationship.
SON PREFERENCE
There are several ways to measure sex preference. Analysis of micro-level data have used relatively direct strategies, using such indicators of sex preference as the preferred sex of the next child (Cleland et al., 1983), the desired sex sequence of later births (Westoff and Rindfuss, 1974), various attitudinal indicators (Coombs, 1979), the sex of the preceding child (Knodel and De Vos, 1980), and so forth (see Park 1994 for more discussion).
At the aggregate level of analysis, some have recommended as indicators of sex preference various aspects of the SRB, such as the SRB by parity within sex (Coale and Banister, 1994), the SRB of last-born children (Park, 1983), and so forth. Given our interest in the influence of son preference on the SRB, we will not follow the above strategy. Conversely, Arnold and Liu (1986) have shown that data on contraceptive use and parity of

preceding children may be used to significant advantage as proxy indicators of sex preference; it is this type of data we use here.
We draw on provincial-level data from the 1988 Two-per-thousand Fertility and Contraception Survey (State Family Planning Commission of China, 1990). According to these data, nearly two-thirds of all currently married women under the age of 49 who had at least one child used some method of contraception. However, there are notable differences in contraception between couples with one or more girls and those with one or more boys. In the country as a whole, 76 per cent of one-child couples who had one boy were using contraception, compared to 64 per cent of one-child couples who had one girl. And similar differences obtain for couples with more than one child, and/or who use other kinds of contraception. For the most part, the percentages of contraceptors are higher among couples with one or more boys than with one or more girls.
Similar patterns obtain among the provinces of China. For instance in Beijing, there are 1.3 per cent more contraceptors among one-child couples who have a boy than among those who have a girl. In contrast, in Shandong Province, this difference between one-child contraceptors who have one boy versus those who have one girl is 16.1 per cent. We interpret this difference as an indication that the degree of son preference in Shandong is higher than in Beijing. We assume that the greater the difference in this index of contraceptive use, the higher the degree of son preference. Moreover, we also expect that such an indication should be positively related with the sex ratio at birth, particularly those forms of

the SRB which we believe to be most influenced by son preference, namely, the SRB's of higher parities where the previous children are girls.
We have calculated five proxy measures of son preference, as follows: (1) the just mentioned measure of the difference in contraceptive use between onechild couples who have a boy versus those who have a girl; (2) the difference in IUD-use between one-child couples who have a boy versus those who have a girl; (3) the difference in the rate of sterilization between two-child couples who have boys versus those who have girls; (4) the difference in contraceptive use between two-child couples who have two boys versus those who have a boy and a girl; and (5) the difference in the rate of sterilization between two-child couples who have two boys versus those who have a boy and a girl.
This is a broad range of aggregate measures of son preference, ranging from an extreme indicator such as the difference in the rates of sterilization between two-child couples who have two boys versus those who have two girls, to a not too extreme measure, namely, the difference in IUD-use between one-child couples who have a boy versus those who have a girl. We refer to the former as extreme because of the permanency of sterilization and the fact that the comparison base is couples who have two girls. A province with a large difference in the rates of sterilization between two-child couples who have two boys versus those who have two girls would be characterized by high son preference. A province with a low value on this indicator would be characterized by low son preference. We hold that the latter measure is a less

68

Poston et al.

extreme indicator of son preference because IUD-use is nowhere as permanent a contraception technology as sterilization.
Another reason we employ a range of contraceptive use measures to gauge son preference owes to the suggestion by Arnold that general, or total, contraceptive use may not work as well in China as an indicator of son preference as it does in other countries (Arnold, 1987, p. 49). We thus use IUD-use and sterilization data as alternatives to overall contraceptiveuse data; these permit us to be much more specific in gauging the aggregate levels of son preference, and in so doing, allow us to get around Arnold's reservation.
Descriptive data for our five proxy measures of son preference are shown in Table 3. We have already described the first indicator, that pertaining to the difference in contraceptive use of one-child couples who have a boy versus those who have a girl. The second indicator is similar to the first, except that it refers exclusively to IUD-use, the most popular form of contraception by a wide margin in China. One-half of all married fecund women between the ages of 15 and 49 in China in 1982 who were contracepting were using the IUD (Poston, 1986). This indicator has a mean difference across the provinces of 6.5 per cent.
The sterilization indicator has an average value across the provinces of 20 per cent with a standard deviation of 14 per cent. The next indicator is the difference in contraceptive use between two-child couples who have two boys versus those who have a boy and a girl. It has a mean value of 13 per cent and ranges from less than 1 per cent in Tianjin and 1 per cent in Beijing to a high of almost 34 per cent in Jiangxi Province. The last indicator is

more extreme than the preceding; it is the difference in the rate of sterilization between two-child couples who have two boys versus those who have a boy and a girl. It has an average value among the provinces of 16.6 per cent, with a standard deviation of 12 per cent.
We need now to entertain a methodological issue that pertains to the sex preference measures we have developed. The standard deviations for these measures (shown above in Table 3) indicate sizable variability in them across the Chinese provinces. The question to be raised, however, is whether this variation could be artifactual. Xie (1989) has written that these kinds of behavioral indicators of sex preference may be problematic owing "partly to floor and ceiling effects contained in their measures, and partly to sampling variability" (Xie, 1989, p. 292).
Xie (1989) has suggested that measures of sex preference based on percentage differences, as are our five indicators, may well be biased because of floor and ceiling effects; the bias "is in the direction of underestimation for (Chinese provinces) . . . with high or low overall rates . . . , and, conversely, in the direction of overestimation for (other provinces)" (1989, p. 293). When Xie addressed the ceiling issues by calculating log-odds-ratios for the various provinces, his resulting measure, which corrected for floor and ceiling effects, was nonetheless still very highly correlated with the original measure; r = 0.851 (1989, Table 3). Since our five indicators of sex preference are similar to the one examined by Xie, we use his correlation result to suggest that the problem of floor and ceiling effects may not be that troublesome an issue for our measures.

Xie next addressed the fact that the measures of son preference examined by him did not possess much face validity; that is, they were not associated in the expected direction with measures such as the fertility rate and the sex ratio of the last born child. Thus, the variation in their values across the Chinese provinces, he speculated, could well be due to sampling variability. Let us look in more detail at the issue of face validity, known also as logical validation.
Aggregate analyses of son preference in developing, especially Asian, countries, some of which has been reviewed above, report for the most part that the degree of son preference in an area should be negatively associated with the area's levels of modernization and social and cultural development, including absolute and relative features of women's status. Let us thus examine the face validity of a few of our measures of sex preference by relating them with various indicators of modernization and women's status.
We use an assortment of nine measures of modernization and women's status. They all pertain to the time period of 1982 and most are based on data from the 1982 China census (see Poston and Gu, 1987).

Our indicators of son preference, as mentioned earlier, are measured with data for 1988 and apply to 29 provinces. However, two of the provinces shown in 1988 and 1990, namely Guangdong and Hainan, were a single province in 1982. Hence, the relationships of the modernization and women's status variables based on 1982 data with the measures of son preference based on 1988 data that we show below in Table 4 are for 28 provinces, with Guangdong and Hainan provinces combined as one.
The nine modernization and women's status variables are the following: (1) percentage of households that are threegeneration households (3GEN); (2) female age at first marriage (lstMAR); (3) gross national product (GNP); (4) percentage of females employed in nonagricultural jobs (FNONAG); (5) female literacy rate (FLIT); (6) ratio of females to males employed in nonagricultural jobs (F/MNONAG); (7) ratio of females to males who have completed at least middle school (F/MMID); (8) meat (kg) consumed (in 1982) per population (MEAT); and (9) food oil (kg) consumed (in 1982) per population (OIL).
Table 4 presents correlation coefficients between each of these nine independent

70

variables and the first three of our measures of son preference already described, namely, the difference in contraceptive use between one-child couples who have a boy versus those who have a girl (CONTdifl); (2) the difference in IUD-use between one-child couples who have a boy versus those who have a girl (IUDdifl); and (3) the difference in the rate of sterilization between two-child couples who have boys versus those who have girls (STERdifl).
The first two of the nine modernization and women's status variables refer roughly to cultural factors, namely, the tradition of maintaining three-generation households and the age at which females should marry. The 3GEN variable should be positively associated with the measures of son preference, i.e., the greater the percentage of households in a province that are three-generation households, the greater the prevalence of son preference. All three of the correlations in the first column of Table 4 are positive, and two are 0.24 or greater. The highest correlation is with the very extreme contraceptive-usebased measure of son preference pertaining to sterilization (STERdifl). The age-atfirst-marriage-for-females variable should be negatively related with the measures of son preference; all three of the correlations in the second column of Table 4 are negatively signed, and two are 0.24 or higher.
Gross national product is a measure of the level of economic activity in the province in 1982, and it should be negatively associated with son preference. All three of the correlations in the third column of the table are negative in direction, and two are 0.24 or higher.
The next two variables, the percentage of females in the nonagricultural labor force, and the female literacy rate, are ab-

solute measures of women's status in that they refer only to the standing of women and do not take into account the standing of men. Both these FNONAG and FLIT variables should be negatively associated with son preference; all six of the correlations in the 4th and 5th columns of Table 4 are negative.
The next two variables, the ratio of females to males in the nonagricultural labor force, and the ratio of females to males who have completed at least middle school, are relative measures of women's position because they measure the position of women relative to men. The F/MNONAG and F/MMID variables should both be related negatively with the son preference measures; that is, the higher the relative position of women to men, the lower the son preference. All six of the correlations in the 6th and 7th columns of Table 4 are negative.
Finally, the last two indicators, the number of per capita kilograms of meat and oil, respectively, consumed in 1982 in the province, reflect general levels of living and prosperity; the higher the amounts of meat and oil consumed, the lower the son preference. Five of the six correlations between the MEAT and OIL variables and the measures of son preference in the last two columns of the table are negative as expected.
Of the 27 correlations between the nine development and women's status variables and the three contraceptive-use-based indicators of son preference, 26 are in the expected direction, and many are quite sizable in magnitude. We interpret these results as providing indication of a good amount of face validity for the sex preference measures. The sex preference variables seem for the most part to be behaving in the way one would expect them to behave with respect to their associations with the

modernization and women's status variables. The provinces that are the more modernized, and those with higher relative and absolute degrees of women's status, tend to have lower degrees of son preference, and vice versa. Finally, we now turn to our assessment of the empirical relationship between sex preference and the sex ratio at birth among the provinces of China.
SON PREFERENCE AND THE SEX RATIO
AT BIRTH
Table 5 presents zero-order correlations between five indicators of son preference and the nine SRB's. As in the correlation analysis reported earlier in Table 2, these are also pair-wise correlation coefficients; that is, each correlation has been calculated only for those provinces with SRB's that have at least 50 births in the numerator and denominator. For instance, 29 provinces are used in correlations involving the total SRB, the SRB for parity 1, and the SRB for parity 2. Fewer provinces are included in the correlations involving the other SRB's. The number of provinces involved in the correlations with each of the nine SRB's is shown in the bottom row of Table 5.
All five of the son preference variables have positive correlations with the total SRB. The higher the degree of son preference according to these measures of contraception differences, the higher the SRB. However, none of the indicators of son preference have positive associations with the SRB for parity 1. Since the SRB's of parity 1 are the closest of all the SRB's to the normal range of sex ratios, one would not expect son preference, however measured, to be related positively with this particular sex ratio.
There are fifteen correlations between the five son preference indicators and

the three SRB's specific to the second parity. Twelve of the correlations are positive as anticipated, although a few are less than +0.10. The highest correlation is between one of the IUD-use indicators of son preference and the SRB for parity 2 where the prior birth was a female, r = 0.43. These correlations provide good empirical support for our hypothesis.
However, when we move to the parityspecific SRB's for parity 3, only three of the possible 20 correlations with the son preference variables are in the hypothesized positive direction. Almost all are negative in sign. One reason for such an unexpected finding is the fact that sex ratios at this parity apply to a rather small proportion of the population of the provinces. For instance, parity-three births comprise less than 12 per cent of all births. These SRB's represent extreme forms of the phenomenon owing in part to China's unique fertility control policy; they thus pertain, on average, to a rather small and marginal element of the population.
We hypothesized earlier that positive associations should obtain between the degree of son preference in a province and its SRB. We found support for this hypothesis in the correlations between the son preference indicators and the total SRB, and between the son preference indicators and the SRB specific for the second parity. The hypothesis was not supported when we focused on other SRB's, namely, the SRB for parity 1, and the SRB's for parity 3. We turn now to a brief consideration of the implications of our research.

an important way to variation among the provinces in the degree of son preference. Our analysis has shown abnormally high SRB's in most of the provinces of China, especially at parities 2 and higher when the prior births were daughters. These patterns, however, are not unique to China. We noted earlier that other societies with rapid fertility decline and strong son preference also manifest abnormally high SRB's at parities beyond the first, namely, Taiwan and South Korea.
It may well be the case that the abnormally high SRB's now characterizing China, Taiwan, and South Korea may be a transitory phenomenon that will diminish as these societies move to full modernization. Indeed, as noted above, our research in progress is addressing precisely this issue, to wit, that the issue of the high sex ratio at birth may best be addressed when gender inequities are narrowed and strong son preference reduced. These kinds of changes are most likely to occur with increases in socioeconomic development and modernization. The empirical results we reported in Table 4 are very consistent with such an appraisal.
It is also true that the abnormally high SRB's in China may well be associated with the one-child policy instituted in the country in 1979 (Li and Cooney, 1993). But this does not necessarily mean that China would not be plagued by high SRB's if the one-child policy were relaxed or even terminated. Witness the high sex ratios in Taiwan and South Korea where such drastic fertility policies do not exist. Were China's policy relaxed, the main difference would probably be that the SRB deviations from normality might not occur until after the second parity, instead of, as is now the case in China, after the first parity.
In an important manner, the high SRB's

in China, and also in Taiwan and South Korea, seem to have much to do with the rapidity of the fertility decline and theconcomitant downsizing of norms concerning family size. However, the evidence from other Asian countries, for instance, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, suggests that for abnormally high SRB's to occur, the rapid fertility decline needs to take place within the context of high son preference. If son preference is low, as it is in the three countries in South and Southeast Asia just mentioned, the rapid fertility decline will not necessarily lead to abnormally high SRB's.
Our discussions in this paper; and elsewhere (Ng and Gu, 1995; Gu and Li, 1994), point to the importance of viewing the fertility transition in China and in other countries, not as a single dimension process focusing only on changes in fertility. Rather the transition needs to be regarded as an integral component of the overall transition of the society from a traditional form to a modern one. Such a consideration thus needs to address not only the level of fertility, but also the timing of childbearing and the sex composition of the children. When fertility declines rapidly with regard to the number of children a couple may have, the tradition of strong preference for sons over daughters will become more salient. Accordingly, sociocultural factors will likely be more influential than economic ones in the decision process. This factor may be why the patterns and trends of abnormally high SRB's observed in China are also seen in some other Asian countries with similar cultural contexts and rapid fertility declines.
Accordingly, population and family planning programs need to be implemented not only with respect to the goal of lowering fertility, but also with regard to maintaining a balanced SRB. The perfor-
