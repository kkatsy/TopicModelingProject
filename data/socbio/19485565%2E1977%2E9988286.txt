ABSTRACT: The total consanguineous and nonconsanguineous marriages (n = 7,671) celebrated in Puchuncaví, Chile, from 1810 to 19S9 were analyzed and related to demographic and sociocultural variables. Celibacy, widowhood, and illegitimacy were found to influence the mating structure of the population, producing assortative mating or lowering the probability of marriage.

"Marriage is a demographic event through which the component of the human ecosystem, interacting with biological and cultural inheritance, acts on human evolution by means of the choice of the husband or wife" (Moroni and Conterio, 1972). If this definition is accepted, it is possible to understand why the mating structure of the human species, with all its complexities, has largely been studied by social scientists and biologists. Thus, there are studies on the theories of mating structure (assortative and random mating, taboos, etc.) and on the factors that influence the choice of mate (spouse's age; geographical and biological propinquity; phenotypic, social, cultural, and religious characteristics, etc.) in primitive as well as modern populations (Freire-Maia and Krieger, 1963; Mange, 1964; Kiser, 1965; Levi-Strauss, 1968; Spuhler, 1968; Johnston et al., 1969; Chagnon et al., 1970; Fox, 1972; Rosenwaike, 1972; Barrai et al., 1962; Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1966; Schull et al., 1968; Girard, 1974; Segalen and Jacquard, 1971, 1973; Jacquard, 1968, 1969; Henry, 1968, 1969a, 19696; Langaney, 1969; Kunstadter et al., 1963; Lewontin et al., 1968; Garrison et al.,

1968). These data are essential for understanding the genetic structure of populations (Kuchemann et al., 1967; Crow and Felsenstein, 1968; Eckland, 1968; Schull and McCluer, 1968; Schull, 1972).
In this paper we shall consider some social and demographic variables which may affect consanguineous marriages (CM) and nonconsanguineous marriages (NCM) in a rural zone of Chile, during a period of ISO years (1810-19S9). These variables are four: a demographic one, marital status; and three social ones, legitimacy, legal affinity, and illegal affinity. An individual (man or woman) has legal affinity with any person related to his (her) first mate and has illegal affinity with anyone related to a person with whom he (she) has been sexually intimate.
Our interest stems from two facts: (1) there is little information about the influence on the mating structure of the variables utilized (Girard, 1974), and practically none for Chile; and (2) we wish to know if there are characteristics that could cause some type of homogamy or isolation, since it has been shown in a mixed Chilean population that there are

cent.
3. The total number of marriages in the first, second, and third subperiod are, respectively, 33.43, 46.07, and 20.50 per cent of the general total. This distribution is probably due to the development and evolution of the Puchuncavi zone and to the differences in the accuracy of the data required from the mates at their time of marriage.
4. There is an enormous decrease of the CM from the first to third subperiod, maintaining nevertheless a high rate of consanguinity. This fact has been already demonstrated by Lazo et al. (1970) for this zone.
5. The frequency of couples in which the husband or the wife are illegitimate are very similar on the whole, (Class -1-- has a

of Class 2000), and from Italy for 1951 (2.85 per cent of marriages of Class 1000 and 0.90 per cent of marriages of Class 2000). The reasons could be economic or social. The second is supported by the data of Lazo et al. (1973) on the differential mortality (higher mortality in the women than in men) in this zone for the period 1851-60. The different mortality in Puchuncavi could be due to labor or puerperal complications, because there are no reasons to suppose, in the absence of other information, that this difference in mortality could be due to other causes of death. Finally, we can argue that a differential migration pattern could also be the cause of this disproportion of widowers and widows, but we have not enough information to examine this fact.

and illegal affinities, with greater frequencies in CM than NCM; secondly, that widowhood and illegitimacy could have a "negative" effect (less probability of finding a mate) on the CM; and thirdly, that if we exclude the class 0000 ("normal"), the most frequent classes are those which have only one variable present: 0100, 0200, 1000, 2000, 0001, 0300. With four variables and four alternatives in each vari-

able, 256 different classes of marriages are possible. The 57 classes found in this study mean that something alters the possible combinations. A cause could be the different frequencies of each variable, some very low (legal and illegal affinities). However, we think that the main cause resides in the variables themselves. Unfortunately, the frequencies of the classes with two or more variables are too low for us to

conclude that any combination of this type, in one or both mates, could diminish the probability of marriage.
Several chi-square tests were done on the data of Table 1. Because of the absence or small number of classes in some subperiods or CM and NCM, the last 49 classes (3000 to 1102) were regrouped in only one. All of them, with one exception, were significant, and we show here those which corroborate the facts mentioned above, that is to say, the enormous heterogeneity in the distribution of the different classes of marriages in time and CM and NCM and the slightly greater homogeneity of the CM. These chi-squares with their degrees of freedom (df ) and probability (P) are given below:
Comparison among the three subperiods (CM and NCM together), x2 = 344.88, df = 16, P < 0.001.
Comparison between CM and NCM (total data), x2 = 132.38, df = 8, P < 0.001.
Comparison among the three subperiods (CM only), x2 = 40.43, df = 16, P < 0.001.
Comparison among the three subperiods (NCM only), x2 = 286.40, df = 16, P < 0.001.
In order to classify the possible nonrandom distribution of males and females, we compared the distribution of men and women, classifying as "normal" individuals those without any impediment, and as "abnormal" individuals those with some impediment (widowhood, illegitimacy, legal or illegal affinities). The total data are given in Table 2 for the three subperiods and for CM and NCM. From this table we can see that the relative frequencies of women without impediment are always greater than those of men without impediment, in CM as well as in NCM; but comparing the consanguineous and nonconsanguineous marriages, the greater frequencies of both men or women

marriages; and (4) that widowhood has a greater negative effect on women, in consanguineous or nonconsanguineous marriages, than on men. The tendency of similar people to marry seems clear; in other words, marriages between consanguineous or nonconsanguineous individuals are not at random in relation to these variables.
To test the heterogeneity of the different classes in time as well as CM and NCM, several chi-square tests were done. The values are shown in Table 4. The distribution of the different classes is more homogeneous in CM than in NCM, and the heterogeneity between CM and NCM is high.
A similar analysis was not possible with legal and illegal affinities because their absence is the most common state, which causes a very low frequency of some classes. However, the analysis of the frequencies of the classes that involved these variables showed (a) that all of them decreased in time, perhaps because they are not always declared and/or recorded in the parish files; (b) that the most frequent classes are those in which the man has legal or illegal affinity and those in which the woman has illegal or legal affinity; and (c) that some classes are probably more frequent in CM because in these types of

marriages they are more carefully recorded.
We examined the relationship between these two variables, marital status and legitimacy. We considered only the classes where the man has legal or illegal affinities and the woman has legal or illegal affinities, because they are the most representative. In cases where the man or the woman has had intercourse with a relative of his (her) future mate, the most frequent relationship is with single and legitimate individuals. Of 305 cases of Class--01, there are 198 cases of Class 0001, 30 cases of Class 0201, and 30 cases of Class 0101; and of 38 cases of Class --02, there are 30 cases of Class 0002. In cases where the man or the woman has had intercourse with a relative of the first spouse, logically, the most frequent relationship isbetween widows and widowers. So, of 95 cases of Classes --10, there are 75 cases of Class 1010, and 7 cases of Class 3010; and of 25 cases of Class --20, there are 17cases of Class 2020, and 5 cases of Class 2220.
Naturally, a work of this type should be related to the genetic structure of the population. However, it would be necessary to know some phenotypic or genotypic characteristics related to the variables considered. Unfortunately, we do not presently have such information. But
