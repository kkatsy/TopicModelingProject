ABSTRACT: Genetic-epidemiological data and linkage studies with chromosomal markers are reviewed from the vantage point of X-linked inheritance. The results overall suggest that a gene predisposing to manic depression (bipolar affective illness) localized on the X-chromosome may exist in a subgroup of bipolar cases. However, in light of conflicting findings and methodological uncertainties in studying a disorder with unclear phenotype and complex inheritance, this issue is not yet closed. Additional research, including new linkage data and extension and re-evaluation of published data, is required to further our understanding of this intriguing hypothesis.

Manic depression, also known as bipolar affective illness, is a severe mood disorder typified by manic and depressive episodes, variable age of onset (second to seventh decade of life), and lifetime prevalence of 0.5 to 1.0 per cent. The disease can lead to multiple hospitalizations, impaired psychosocial functioning, suicide, and substance use (alcoholism and drug abuse). Because of its high population prevalence, it has been dubbed a major public health concern. Somatic therapies are generally efficacious, but the etiology and pathophysiology of the illness remain elusive.
Genetic factors have long been implicated in manic depression, as evidenced by family, twin, and adoption studies: the illness clusters in families; the concordance rate in monozygotic twins is higher than in dizygotic twins; and the risk for affective disorders in the biological parents of manic depressive adoptees exceeds that found in the biological parents of normal adoptees (Gershon, 1990; Baron, 1991). These observations underscore the role of heredity in manic depression.

Various genetic models have been proposed, including single gene inheritance; epistasis (interaction between alleles at different loci); and polygenicmultifactorial transmission. But none could be concluded to the exclusion of alternative formulations (Gershon, 1990; Baron, 1991). Among the singlegene hypotheses invoked for manic depression, X-linkage (i.e., the hypothesis that the illness is transmitted through a gene on the X-chromosome) appears to enjoy remarkable longevity, since it was proposed over a half century ago (Rosanoff et al., 1935). In this paper, I will discuss geneticepidemiological data and chromosomal linkage findings pertaining to this hypothesis.
GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY
The hallmarks of X-linked dominant inheritance, namely, no male-tomale transmission and an excess of affected women, have been observed in earlier family and epidemiological studies. Noteworthy in this regard are the studies of Winokur et al. (1969)

and Mendlewicz and Rainer (1974). In Winokur et al.'s family study, the risk for female first-degree relatives of bipolar probands was greater than that for male first-degree relatives, and instances of male-to-male transmission were not in evidence. Mendlewicz and Rainer (1974) found that male-to-male transmission in their series of families was limited to a small minority of cases. However, subsequent family studies have pointed to a more complex pattern of inheritance (Gershon et al., 1982; Rice et al., 1987), and recent epidemiological data indicate that bipolar disorder is equally common in females and in males; unipolar major depression, a subset of which is thought related to bipolar illness, is more common in females, however (Goodwin and Jamison, 1990).
Comparisons across sexes or across generations may be markedly biased due to underlying differences in rates of illness for these categories. Evidence already exists both for sex and generational (secular or cohort effects) differences in the rate of affective disorders (Gershon et al., 1982; Klerman et al., 1985). For this reason, in examining the hypothesis of X-linkage, it is advisable to control both for sex and generation. To do so, Risch et al. (1986) computed the ratio of risk to a particular type of relative by sex of proband and compared these ratios to predictions made by the X-linkage hypothesis. In addition, they employed logistic regression and maximum likelihood, allowing for the effects of sex of relative, sex of proband, generation, and X-linked transmission. It is important to note that, in view of generation effects and etiologic heterogeneity, family data would not yield easily to

traditional types of model fitting, such as segregation analysis.
In their analysis, Risch et al. used three large data sets originating from different centers: a family study conducted in New York in 1968-72 (Mendlewicz and Rainer, 1974); published family data from a similar study in Bethesda in 1974-79 (Gershon et al., 1982); and other data compiled from the literature, as summarized by Gershon et al. (1976). The analysis of risk ratios by sex of proband showed consistency for the three data sets with the predictions of X-linked dominant inheritance. The New York and Bethesda studies both suggested the possibility of X-linkage and heterogeneity within study. The logistic regression results were incompatible with an alternate model for sex difference in affective illness, namely, the sex-specific threshold model (either single major locus or polygenic inheritance). According to a threshold model, the relatives of the less frequently affected sex (males) are at a greater risk for the illness than the relatives of the more frequently affected sex (females). None of the studies fit these predictions. This is consistent with a previous analysis of the New York data which did not find a satisfactory fit to the sexspecific single-locus threshold model (Baron, 1983). Taken together, these analyses indicate that in all three samples the largest effect is due to X-linkage. The results also suggest that X-linked inheritance is present in only a subset of bipolar illness, i.e., genetic heterogeneity. In addition, analysis of the New York data indicates that an X-linked subgroup may be associated with early illness onset (before 30 years old).

CHROMOSOMAL LINKAGE
Genetic marker strategies constitute a powerful approach in the search for disease-related genes. Genetic markers are variations, or alleles, at specific chromosomal loci. The relation of a genetic marker to a putative disease gene can be determined by linkage analysis. Linkage refers to the tendency of alleles at separate loci to be co-inherited. The statistical test criterion is the lod score, or the logarithm of odds in favor of the linkage hypothesis. The generally accepted lod threshold for evidence of linkage is 3.0 (the equivalent of a 1,000:1 ratio between the probability of observing the data given the hypothesis of linkage and that of observing the data in the absence of linkage). When the lod value is smaller than -2.0, linkage is rejected. The recombination fraction between the disease locus and the marker locus (range: 0 to 50 per cent) is indicative of the map distance between the two loci. For small recombination values, 1 per cent recombination corresponds to 1 centiMorgan (cM) in map units.
Linkage studies with X-chromosome markers in manic depression have been in evidence for nearly two decades. The results are summarized in Table 1.
Reich et al. (1969) reported the first evidence for X-linkage using the X-chromosome marker color blindness (CB) in two large North-American bipolar pedigrees. This publication was followed by other reports. The largest series of North-American pedigrees was studied by Mendlewicz and Fleiss (1974). They concluded close linkage of bipolar illness to CB in 17 bipolar pedigrees, and loose linkage to the Xg

blood group in 23 pedigrees. Linkage to CB or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was reported subsequently in smaller series: a North-American pedigree (Baron, 1977); 8 Belgian pedigrees (Mendlewicz et al., 1979); an Iranian pedigree (Mendlewicz et al., 1980); and 2 Sardinian pedigrees (Del Zompo et al., 1984). A more recent study reported linkage of bipolar illness to CB or G6PD deficiency in 4 Jewish-Israeli non-Ashkenazi (i.e., Mediterranean or Near-Eastern) pedigrees (Baron et al., 1987). A subsequent analysis, incorporating various phenotypic patterns and phenocopy probabilities, showed that the evidence for linkage in these data could not be ascribed to errors arising from diagnostic uncertainties (Baron et al., 1990a). Mendlewicz et al. (1987) described linkage of another X-chromosome marker, a factor IX (F9) DNA polymorphism, to bipolar illness in a series of 10 Belgian pedigrees.
Negative linkage reports are also in evidence. Gershon et al. (1979) reported 6 North-American pedigrees in which CB was not linked to bipolar illness. Linkage to Xg was excluded by the same group of investigators who studied 6 pedigrees drawn from the same North-American series; 2 of the pedigrees were also included in their CB study (Leckman et al., 1979). In more recent studies, Berrettini et al. (1990) found no linkage to the DNA markers F8, DXS52, and DXS15 in 9 North-American pedigrees, and Gejman et al. (1990) ruled out linkage to F9, DXS98, and DXS105 in the same pedigrees.
Of the 14 published studies, 10 yielded positive lod scores, ranging

When the analysis centered on the non-Ashkenazi pedigrees, to the exclusion of the Ashkenazi family, the lod score increased to 9.2 at recombination fraction (map distance) 0.

from 1.5 to 7.5 at recombination fraction of 0 to 15 per cent around the CBG6PD region. In 2 of the studies, (Mendlewicz and Fleiss, 1974; Baron et al., 1987), the lod value was appreciably higher than the conventional lod threshold of 3.0.
X-LINKAGE AND GENETIC HETEROGENEITY
Genetic heterogeneity has been offered as one possible explanation for

the diverse linkage findings. In common disorders with complex phenotypes and transmission patterns (such as manic depression), etiologic heterogeneity is an appealing proposition.
Risch and Baron (1982) reanalyzed published pedigree series and assessed linkage heterogeneity both by a Bayesian approach and by a modified likelihood-ratio test. They estimated the proportion of X-linked bipolar pedigrees to be 64 per cent (including the older studies) or 47 per cent (ex-

eluding the older studies). They noted, however, that this estimate is likely inflated, given the possibility of selective publication of pedigrees with positive evidence for linkage. Also, this estimate is not representative of the population as a whole because pedigrees with male-to-male transmission are excluded automatically from the analysis. Hence, the fraction of X-linked cases in the population is much smaller than these estimates.
In a subsequent analysis, Risch et al. (1986), using published risk ratios in family study data, estimated that 25 per cent of male bipolars may be affected due to an X-linked gene. Interestingly, heterogeneity appeared present within as well as among studies in these analyses. They emphasized, however, that these estimates are merely suggestive and are entirely dependent on the accuracy of the underlying assumptions, in particular, penetrance and the frequency of non-Xlinked forms of the illness in males versus females. In the absence of linkage data in the populations studied, the analysis was limited to geneticepidemiological data.
It is important to mention that the apparent heterogeneity in the X-linkage data, as reanalyzed by Risch and Baron (1982), was not due to combining "positive" results from one series of pedigrees with "negative" ones from another. Clearly, homogeneous linkage within some pedigree series in the face of heterogeneity across studies might be ascribed to a systematic error in some of the "positive" studies. When Risch and Baron reanalyzed only the pedigree series published by Mendlewicz and his colleagues, who provided the bulk of the evidence for X-linkage in the Risch and Baron anal-

ysis, heterogeneity was still significant. The degree of heterogeneity in the more recent pedigree series with strong evidence for X-linkage was marginally significant (Baron et al., 1987).
Baron et al. (1987) suggested that ethnic differences might account for some of the apparent heterogeneity in linkage results. In their series, linkage was observed in the non-Ashkenazi pedigrees, but not in the single Ashkenazi (European) family. Evidence for linkage in other populations of a similar ethnic background was noted in earlier studies (Mendlewicz et al., 1980; Del Zompo et al., 1984). By comparison, all the negative linkage results stemmed from populations of a different ethnic extraction. It should be acknowledged, however, that not all pedigrees with evidence for linkage originated in the same genetic "pool." Hence, ethnic differences cannot be the sole explanation for the inconsistency in linkage data.
The many instances of male-to-male transmission in manic-depressive illness make it likely that an X-linked form of the disease would account for only a minority of cases. Further study is needed to arrive at a more definitive statement on this issue.
CRITIQUE OF LINKAGE RESULTS
Genetic heterogeneity notwithstanding, the possibility that some of the published linkage studies were beset by errors deserves scrutiny.
Gershon and Bunney (1976) found fault with the earliest studies of Mendlewicz and colleagues (Mendlewicz et al., 1972; Mendlewicz and Fleiss, 1974). They noted the imprecise analytic methods used by these investiga-

tors and pointed out the conflicting claim of linkage both with CB and with Xg, two loci which are far apart on the X-chromosome.
In a reanalysis of these data, Baron et al. (1981) and Risch and Baron (1982) addressed some of these issues, especially as regards ascertainment bias, method of analysis, genetic heterogeneity, and the X-chromosome map. Using a systematic method of pedigree analysis with age-of-onset correction, they essentially confirmed the earlier observation of linkage to CB in some pedigrees, but linkage with Xg could not be supported. Thus, on reanalysis, the results were no longer incompatible with known map distances on the X-chromosome.
The report by Mendlewicz et al. (1987) of linkage to F9 was criticized by Suarez et al. (1987) who pointed out the tenuous nature of the evidence, especially given the impact of delayed illness onset on the diagnostic status of individuals considered unaffected. Other potential limitations of the F9 linkage data concern the large map distance between the CB-G6PD loci and the F9 locus. As noted by Gejman et al. (1990) and Baron (1991), unless the F9 linkage represents a second, independent locus for bipolar illness on the X-chromosome, this finding may be incompatible with the stronger evidence for linkage to the CB-G6PD region.
More recently, Gershon (1991) revived the debate over Mendlewicz et al.'s old data on linkage of bipolar illness to CB and Xg (Mendlewicz et al., 1972; Mendlewicz and Fleiss, 1974). Gershon argued that CB and Xg appear linked to each other in this series of pedigrees, and since these markers are known to be far apart, this points to

systematic genotypic errors which cast doubt on the validity of the original results. In their rebuttal, Mendlewicz et al. (1991) acknowledged an unintentional source of bias resulting from preferential ascertainment of doubly heterozygous females. This selection mechanism could inflate the evidence for linkage, especially in small families. But they also indicated that two unlinked markers, such as CB and Xg, could show spurious linkage in a limited series of pedigrees due to chance cosegregation mimicking linkage. (The linkage between CB and Xg found by Gershon was of marginal statistical significance.)
The negative linkage reports (Gershon et al., 1979; Berrettini et al., 1990; Gejman et al., 1990) have also faced criticism. In his evaluation of these studies, Baron (19916) suggested that some of the negative linkage results may be spurious owing to the inclusion of pedigrees with clear or suspected male-to-male transmission and assortative mating, circumstances known to deflate the evidence for linkage. Also, some of the pedigrees were characterized by low illness density, and hence were less likely to represent the genetic form of the illness.
It should also be mentioned that published pedigree series are fairly small. Simulation studies have shown that if the linked form of the illness is not common (a reasonable proposition given that the great majority of pedigrees show male-to-male transmission), linkage could be missed entirely unless the samples analyzed were much larger than those actually studied (Ott, 1986; Martinez and Goldin, 1989).
In sum, the possibility of Type I (false claim that linkage exists) and

Type II (false exclusion of linkage) errors in some of the studies hitherto reported must be considered. However, assuming no systematic errors (e.g., non-blind procedures for the assignment of phenotypes and genotypes), Type I errors, especially as regards ascertainment bias, cannot account for the large individual lod scores observed in some of the medium-to-largesized pedigrees reported to be linked to CB or G6PD. To date, seven pedigrees with lod scores exceeding 2.0 have been reported, originating from different populations (review: Risch and Baron, 1982; Baron et al., 1987). Detailed discussions of Type I and Type II errors in linkage studies of affective disorders appear elsewhere (Baron et al., 19906; Baron, 1992).
FUTURE COURSE
Advances in molecular and quantitative genetics, coupled with new insights into linkage analysis of complex disorders, have enhanced the prospects of X-linkage studies in manicdepressive illness. These developments can be summarized as follows.
1.--The candidate chromosomal region (Xq27-28) is saturated with DNA polymorphisms, including those related to the color vision pigment gene and to the gene encoding a subunit of the neurotransmitter Y-aminobutyric acid (GABRA3), a potential candidate gene for neuropsychiatric disorders (Davies et al., 1990). These potential markers have supplanted CB and G6PD by the sheer force of numbers and degree of polymorphism. Since most matings can now be rendered informative for linkage analysis, both the number of testable pedigrees and the

power to detect (or exclude) linkage will increase.
2.--Inconsistencies with the genetic map (e.g., the claim of linkage to both CB-G6PD and F9 loci discussed earlier) can be resolved by multilocus analysis of markers spanning the distal long arm of the X-chromosome.
3.--Should linkage to Xq28 be established, existing and newly generated DNA markers could be used to "home in" on the putative disease gene by delineating the smallest obligate region containing the disease locus. This, in turn, should expedite efforts directed at the isolation and cloning of the gene itself.
4.--Simulation studies can be conducted prior to marker typing to ensure that the pedigrees under investigation have a high information content as regards linkage analysis.
5.--As detailed elsewhere (Baron et al., 19906; Baron, 1992), safeguards against spurious linkage results (both Type I and Type II errors) should be implemented. These include blind procedures for phenotyping and genotyping; appropriate ascertainment of family material (particularly, exclusion of male-to-male transmission and assortative mating, and nonselective presentation of all testable pedigrees); reduction of multiple test effects by limiting the number of diagnostic and genetic configurations in the linkage analysis; cautious interpretation of borderline lod scores and adjustment of lod values in the event model-dependent "inflation" is likely; a focus on the narrowly defined phenotype (i.e., bipolar I disorder) and on affected individuals (i.e., a "penetrance-free" model) to reduce the occurrence of phenotypic misclassification; introduction of quan-

titative measurements that grade stability and severity of the psychiatric diagnosis and thus can obviate sporadic cases and phenocopies (Baron et al., 1990a); and due attention to laboratory errors such as sample mixups, nonpaternity and incorrect reading of marker alleles.
6.--A larger sampling to obviate the confounding effect of genetic heterogeneity and to increase the power of linkage analysis.
7. --A search for clinical and biological correlates to sort out homogeneous subsets of the illness which might be more amenable to linkage analysis. It has been suggested, for instance, that early age of onset and a high density of bipolar I disorder (as opposed to bipolar II or unipolar depressive disorders) may characterize the X-linked phenotype (Risch et al., 1986; Baron et al., 1990a).
8.--In view of the uncertain status of the putative X-linked gene, a search for other loci which might act independently or in conjunction with the X-linked locus (i.e., gene-gene interaction) is in order. Additional polygenic and/or environmental effects warrant consideration.
9.--An independent confirmation in new series pedigrees, using the available (and evolving) molecular and sta-

tistical tools, is called for. In the light of possible ethnic differences in genetic patterns, new studies should also focus on Mediterranean and Near-Eastern populations. In the interim, to increase confidence in published linkage results, pedigrees with evidence for X-linkage should be extended and reevaluated by way of adding new individuals, updating the clinical diagnosis (a potentially crucial issue in light of variable age of onset and diagnostic instability over time), and typing additional markers in the region suspected to be linked to the disease locus.
CONCLUSION
How can we best define the current state of X-linkage in manic-depressive illness? It appears that, of the linkages hitherto reported in affective disorders, X-linked inheritance remains a viable hypothesis. But diversefindings and claims of both Type I and Type II errors in some of the published pedigree series necessitate further inquiry into this matter.
