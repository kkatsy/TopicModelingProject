ABSTRACT: Twenty-five per cent of all marriages are consanguineous in a population-based sample of couples from Beirut. Marriages between distant relatives decline with time, while first-cousin marriages remain relatively stable. Among first-cousin marriages, the proportions of father's brother's daughter marriages (37 per cent) and of patrilateral unions (48 per cent) are particularly low. A spatial representation demonstrates an uneven distribution of consanguineous marriages, and an association of high levels of endogamy with Muslim religion, low educational level, and low occupational status.

The Middle East is one of the most urbanized regions of the Third World and one of the most rapidly urbanizing as well. Exposure of a majority of the population to urban life styles might well lead to disruption of traditional family patterns. Urbanization produces two concomitant processes of social change: (1) a continued separation of economic production from the domestic setting, and (2) a growing economic autonomy of women (Hurd, 1978). Communications and mass media also promote change in culture by demonstrating alternative ways of living.
One interesting family pattern which has a close bearing on the genetic composition of the population is the preference for marriages between relatives. Consanguineous marriages are quite common in the Arab countries and their Muslim neighbors, and the ideal wife for a young man in this context is the daughter of one of his father's brothers. Compliance with this social habit has even

pervaded the kinship terminology, to the point that ibn amm means both patrilateral parallel cousin and spouse.
Most studies documenting the structural significance of father's brother's daughter marriages have been of nomadic camps and rural communities, and the impact of urbanization on this mating pattern is still controversial. According to Costello (1977), urban life in the Middle East is altering behavior patterns, and some authors (Chelhod, 1965; Baer, 1967; Prothro and Diab, 1974), indeed contend that cousin marriage is declining in cities. On the other hand, Khun (1975) develops the idea that "the peculiarity of the Middle East as a cultural area may very well lie in the pervasiveness of some . . . cultural beliefs and practices across the three ecological groups" (nomads, villagers, and city-dwellers), and Tillion (1966) and Berque (1962) maintain that endogamy is well rooted in urban contexts. Lastly, Nasr (1982) demonstrates that tradi-

tional social patterns have been preserved or even reinforced among some rural migrant groups.
Given the scarcity of relevant data from Middle Eastern cities, all discussion remains speculative. In order to provide some information on this issue, a population-based description of consanguineous marriages in Beirut is presented in this paper.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

as a book (Zurayk and Armenian, 1985).
STATISTICAL METHODS
Armitage's test was used to assess the significance of the time gradient in consanguineous marriages and Bartholomew's test used to assess the significance of the variation in religion, educational level, and occupational status of the residents by level of endogamy in the sector.

SAMPLE
A health survey of the city of Beirut was undertaken from July 1,1983to August 31,1984 as part of an effort by the Faculty of Health Sciences of the American University of Beirut to establish a Population Laboratory for research purposes. The primary source of funding for this survey was the Ford Foundation. A multistage sampling design was developed, using an administrative division of the city into seven zones of approximately equal size in terms of number of buildings. The sampling procedure consisted of selecting random sectors from the zones, then blocks of buildings from the selected sectors, and finally households from the selected blocks. The sample consisted of 2,752 households interviewed to ascertain their socioeconomic conditions, morbidity, use of health services, environmental health, and perception of health. The survey covered 13,736 individuals, comprising 3,033 ever-married women; these women provided information on the nature of their marriage (in terms of kinship between the spouses), as well as on the religion, educational level, and occupation of their husbands. The complete sampling design and the preliminary results of this survey are published

RESULTS
PREVALENCE
The overall prevalence of consanguineous marriages is 25 per cent (Table 1), and the majority of these marriages (56 per cent) occur between first cousins. Splitting the first-cousin marriages by pedigree (Table 2) shows that patrilateral parallel-cousin marriage (Pedigrees 2 and 4) are quite well represented, amounting to 52.2 per cent of all cousin marriages.
TIME TRENDS
Consanguineous marriages significantly decline with time, represented in this case by date of marriage (Table 3, p < 0.001), the mean proportion vary-

ing from 30 per cent before 1950 (p = 0.76) to 25 per cent between 1950 and 1969 (p = 0.71), to about 20 per cent starting from 1970 (p = 0.66).
Marriages between relatives were classified as "first cousin marriages" and "marriages between more distant relatives" (Table 4), and systematic variations were assessed for each category. Statistical testing reveals that cousin marriages remain stable over time

(p = 0.19), while marriages between distant relatives undergo a significant decline (p = 0.00).
SPATIALDISTRIBUTION
The proportion of consanguineous marriages was computed by sector and mapped (Figure 1). Rates are higher in the western part of the city, comprising a majority of Muslim inhabitants, than in the eastern part, mostly Christian. The two parts are themselves heterogeneous, and, in order to further interpret this spatial pattern, sectors were sorted by level of endogamy (low = less than 20 per cent of consanguineous marriages,medium = from 20per cent to 29 per cent, high = 30 per cent and more) and characterized by the religion, educational level, and occupational status of the husbands (Table 5, 6, and 7). A gradient emerges: The higher the proportion of consanguineous marriages, the higher the proportion of husbands of low educational level (p< 0.005), of low occupational status (p < 0.005), and of Muslim religion (p < 0.005).

DISCUSSION
In this representative sample of Beirut residents, one marriage out of four has occurred between relatives. This rate stands higher than recent estimates from other urban contexts in African Arab countries--Algeria (Ben Al-

legue and Kedji, 1984), Egypt (Hafez et al., 1983), Morocco (Lamdouar, 1983)--but lower than estimates from Kuwait (al-Awadi et al., 1986), or from Syria and Jordan (Prothro and Diab, 1974), although comparability of the figures is restricted by differences in sampling design and sample size.

The data are cross-sectional, and their analysis on a time scale reveals a significant decline of the prevalence of

consanguineous marriages. The fact that cousin marriages remain stable over time, while marriages between more distant relatives lessen suggests that the overall decline in consanguineous marriages mainly reaches this last category. Such a trend is plausible and might be attributed to a progressive weakening of the ties of the extended family in this urban context and consequently a decrease in the long term of the likelihood of marriages between distant relatives. An earlier hospital-based sample (Khlat and Khudr, 1986) does not reveal this pattern, possibly because of an underestimation of marriages between distant relatives among the older generation.
However, given the demographic constraints of urbanization (mainly reduction of number of children per family, and of the kinship network), the observed rate of consanguineous marriages (25 per cent) is indeed very high. The only comparable study in Lebanon is that of Khuri (1970), who demonstrate 11 per cent parallel-patrilateralcousin marriages in a Muslim Beirut suburb. Prothro and Diab (1974), using a nonprobability sample of Sunnite couples, found 26 per cent of marriages between relatives in Beirut, and Khlat and Khudr (1984, 1986) provide a hospital-based estimate of 25 per cent consanguineous marriages. All these values support the existence of a substantial proportion of marriages between relatives in Beirut and its peripheral areas. Regarding the suburbs, this finding may be interpreted as a nurturing of rural values by the most recent waves of rural migrants; however, migration within Beirut itself is relatively ancient, dating back to the beginning of the century (Nasr, 1979), and long-term survival of rural life styles in this context is unlikely. Besides, the observation in

our survey of a high prevalence of endogamy in quarters of old Beirutis (Sanayeh, Mazraa, Malaab) suggests that the preference for marrying relatives is also an urban feature. This hypothesis undoubtedly deserves further investigation, and data on the composition of the sectors in terms of origin of the residents (rural/urban) could provide valuable evidence to confirm it.
Will consanguineous marriages pursue their decline, or does the observed rate of cousin marriage correspond to a state of equilibrium? The finding here is that consanguineous couples are as "modern" as others for a number of criteria (Khlat and Khudr, 1984). Furthermore, the protracted civil war, now in its twelfth year, might well contribute to reinforce in-group preference in matrimonial choices.
Among Middle Eastern cities, the specificity of Beirut is the existence of a spatial partition on a religious basis. This structure is reflected in the rates of consanguineous marriages, which are higher in the Muslim part. While the Koran does not recommend cousin marriage, it does not proscribe it either, as the Christian religion does. Nevertheless, cousin marriages do occur in the eastern part of the city, a fact which may be attributed to the tolerance of the Lebanese clergy of this custom.
Consanguineous marriages are mostly first-cousin marriages, among which patrilateral-parallel-cousin marriages are a majority. Our estimate of the proportion of patrilateral parallel marriages (37 per cent) and of both patrilateral marriages (48 per cent) is lower than estimates from suburban (Khuri, 1970) or rural (Ayoub, 1959) contexts in Lebanon. Further, data from a hospital-

based sample in Beirut (Khlat and Khudr, 1986) show a lower prevalence of patrilateralfirst-cousinunions in a recent urban generation when compared to an older and partly rural generation. A similar decrease in the proportion of patrilateral first-cousin marriages from villages to towns, is observed by Todd (1984) in Iran and interpreted by this author as a matrilateral drift of the kinship system, ascribable to the growing economic importance of women in Middle Eastern societies. Demographic factors (breakup of patrilocal residence patterns, decrease in the number of possible patrilateral cousin marriages) may also play a major role in this shift in the classical pattern of preference.
The association of high rates of endogamy with the Muslim religion, low educational level, and low occupational status confirms earlier results (Khlat and Khudr, 1986) at the population level and define as well the profile of the target population to be addressed by a public health campaign (Khlat et al., 1986). Since low social status is generally correlated with high mortality and morbidity, the immediate implication of such a finding is that the social indicators must be controlled for when assessing consanguinity effects on public health parameters. The same conclusion has been reached by several authors (Neel et al., 1970; Rao and Inbaraj, 1977, 1980) dealing with other endogamous populations in Japan and India.
