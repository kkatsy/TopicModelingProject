of the Indian females on the birth rate in India. The object of this note is to lend support to Basavarajappa's contention that the decrease in the Indian birth rate will not be appreciable if the minimum ageat marriage of the females is raised to twenty years. A new methodology is suggested here which is flexible enough to allow for relaxing some of the stronger conditions assumed by Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad (1967). The effect on the Indian female birth rate is worked out under the following assumptions:

tion 2 may seem to be a little unrealistic. In view of the fact that corresponding to any age distribution, one can find a stable population, a result demonstrated by Bourgeois-Pichat (1958), this assumption can be profitably used to examine the implications of a certain course of action. Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad (1967) assume that remarriages of widows and divorcees will not become common during the period under study. In the methodology developed here, there is no way to take care of this assumption. Hence, the per cent reduction in the birth rate computed by the technique

the length of generation. We confine our attention to the female population. Keyfitz (1968a) has demonstrated relations between the proportional changes in two of the parameters of (1) when the third one is kept constant. In a situation similar to the one we have, all these parameters do change. Hence, we have to find relations among the proportional changes in all the three parameters when all of them change. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of (1), we get

r = ±logRo.

Ar, AR0, and AT are the changes in r, Ro and T respectively. Equation (4) can be used to estimate the per cent reduction in the birth rate under Assumption 2.
The method of computation is as follows. From Equation (4) we set the per cent reduction in r. Let the new value of the intrinsic rate be r'. For the given level of mortality, this value r' of the intrinsic rate determines a unique stable population whose birth and death rates can be read from the tables (Coale and Demeney, 1966). If b were the original birth rate to start with, and b' the birth rate corresponding to the intrinsic rate r', then the per cent reduction in the birth rate is (b -- b')/(b) X 100. Male birth rate can be estimated by employing the method suggested in the United Nations Manual IV (1967, p. 60). Reduction in the male birth rate can be worked out under suitable assumptions. No

attempt is made here to find the per cent reduction in the male birth rate.
DATA AND FINDINGS
The age-specific birth rates and the age specific marital birth rates used for this exercise are given in Table 1.
Model West mortality level No. 12 ensures an expectation of 47.5 years at birth (Basavarajappa and Belvalgidad, 1967, use United Nations Model Life Tables with the same expectation of life at birth). A good approximation of the length of generation is the average of the mean ages of child-bearing in the stationary and stable populations (Keyfitz, 1968J, p. 126). However, following Barclay (1958, p. 220), we approximate the length of generation by the mean age at childbearing in the stationary population, since the error of this approximation is not great (Keyfitz, 1968J, p. 142).
The original and the new values of r, T, Ro and b for the Indian female population are given in Table 2.
It is clear from Table 2 that the per cent reduction in the female birth rate will not be more than 14% in the course of a generation (i.e., within 28 to 29 years). If the daughter generation has a greater expectation of life at birth than the mother generation, the per cent decline in the intrinsic rate and hence in the birth rate will be reduced. The Ryder (1959) correction can be applied to estimate the reduction in such a case.
