ABSTRACT:Throughout sub-Saharan Africa there is notable concern about the consequences of premarital sexual intercourse, such as illegal abortions and pregnancy-related school dropouts, and the potential risk of HIV infection. Using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys, the authors investigated sexual activity among never-married women aged 15-24 in Botswana Burundi, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, and Zimbabwe. While there are important cross-country differentials, in most countries the majority of unmarried adolescents have been sexually active. Contrary to the common belief that teenage premarital sexual activity is a new phenomenon caused by socioeconomic development, particularly Western education, the data show that in most countries sexual activity among unmarried adolescents was also common in the past, and that increases across cohorts have occurred mostly in countries where the prevalence was already high. For most countries, there is little support for theories claiming that education is associated with loose morals and high levels of premarital sexual activity. The findings highlight the importance of family-planning services for unmarried adolescents and of family-life education in primary schools to reach children before they become sexually active.

Sexual activity among unmarried women has become a major social concern in many African countries. Although the rate of teenage childbearing exceeds 200 per thousand in parts of the region, the low age at first marriage means that most sexual activity among adolescents occurs within marriage. However, in some countries, the proportion of children born outof-wedlock is not trivial (United Nations, 1989). While sexual activity among unmarried men is socially accepted, and premarital births may be incorporated into the larger kinship structure (Orubuloye, 1987) or be legitimized by a subsequent legal union, there is an increasing awareness of the potentially negative consequences for women of premarital pregnancy.
One of the most visible consequences of sexual activity among un-

married women is the increasing incidence of abortion complications among unmarried women (Castle et al., 1990; Kulin, 1988; Oronsaye, 1983). In the Kenyatta National Hospital of Nairobi, abortion was the leading cause of admission to the emergency gynecological ward and women age 15-19 accounted for one-third of all abortion cases admitted, 60 per cent of which were induced outside the hospital (Ajayi et al., 1991). Similarly, in five hospitals in the Lagos metropolitan area, 55 per cent of abortion patients were under age 20; 85 per cent of the cases reported were single women; and about 60 per cent had received secondary or higher education (Okagbue, 1990). It is estimated that illegal abortions may account for 20-50 per cent of maternal deaths in many developing countries (Mahler, 1987), and that

there are 50-100 abortion-related deaths per 100,000 illegal procedures compared to less than 1 per 100,000 legal abortions in the United States (Winikoff, 1991).
Furthermore, the consequences of mistimed pregnancy among unmarried women are increasingly reflected in a high rate of school dropout as a result of pregnancy (Akuffo, 1987; Khasiani, 1985). In parts of Kenya, over 10 per cent of female students drop out from secondary school each year as a result of pregnancy (Eshiwani, 1985). In another survey, 66 per cent of 211 teenage mothers had become pregnant while in primary school (Muraya, 1985, cited in Ayayi et al., 1991). Although it is theoretically possible for these girls to return to school after the birth of their child, in practice, few are able to do so (Dynowski-Smith, 1991; Lesetedi et al., 1989; République de Côte d'Ivoire, 1990).
With the rapid spread of the AIDS epidemic in parts of Africa, new concerns center around the prevalence of sexual activity before marriage, the degree of sexual networking, and its association with an increased risk of infection from the HIV virus and other sexually transmitted diseases (e.g., Caldwell et.al., 1989; Ocholla-Ayayo et al., 1990). In this paper, we document current levels of sexual activity among unmarried women in seven countries of sub-Saharan Africa, namely Botswana, Burundi, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Togo, and Zimbabwe.
PAST RESEARCH
Until recently, few studies had examined patterns of premarital sexual activity among adolescents, partly due

to the sensitive nature of the topic which prevented the inclusion of questions on sexual activity in major surveys. Nevertheless, indirect estimates could be made from information on premarital births and conceptions from the birth histories. From the World Fertility Survey data, it was found that in some countries including Benin, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire and Nigeria, over 30 per cent of first births were premaritally conceived. In these countries, at least one in every five women aged 20-24 had a premarital conception leading to a live birth during their teenage years (United Nations, 1989).
A few studies have focused explicitly on the sexual behavior of the unmarried. In a study of 3,000 unmarried Kenyan men and women aged 12-19, Ajayi et al. (1991) found that over 50 per cent (62 per cent of males and 39 per cent of females) were sexually active, having initiated sex around age 13-14. They also found a higher level of sexual activity among nonstudents than students. A study of sexual networking in Ekiti, Nigeria, by Orubuloye et al. (1991) showed a high level of premarital and extramarital sexual activity, with higher levels for men than women and in urban than in rural areas.
Research on premarital sexual activity supports different explanations for the high incidence of this behavior in some societies. Some studies emphasize that marital patterns are changing and that informal unions are becoming increasingly prevalent among younger cohorts (Sombo, 1985), particularly in urban areas (Lacombe, 1983, 1987; Karanja, 1987; Obbo, 1987). Other studies emphasize changes in attitudes and values regarding sexual activity

before marriage. Ocholla-Ayayo et al. (1990, p. 67) observe in a recent Kenyan survey that 60 per cent of respondents did not believe that traditional norms restricting premarital and extramarital sexual relations were applicable in contemporary society. Likewise, Orubuloye et al. (1991) note in a Nigerian community that premarital virginity was no longer considered important, particularly in urban areas. The decline of traditional controls on sexual activity among unmarried women is attributed to the process of social change and development, and to time spent in school which lengthens the period between menarche and marriage, hence the socially defined period of adolescence.
Although levels of premarital sexual activity in parts of sub-Saharan Africa are alleged to be on the increase, the extent of change between traditional and contemporary society is sometimes difficult to establish (Caldwell et al., 1989). Most societies imposed few restrictions on premarital sexual relations for men (David and Voas, 1981). While tolerance for female premarital sexual activity varied strongly from one society to the next, the greater importance of lineage versus conjugal ties among matrilineal groups meant that children were often welcome additions to their mother's lineage irrespective of the mother's marital status at the time of birth. In some other cultures, girls were given a fair degree of latitude with respect to premarital sex, as long as it did not result in a premarital birth, was fairly discreet, and did not occur before initiation ceremonies or transgress incest prohibitions (Caldwell et al., 1989).

In spite of rapid urbanization and increasing levels of education, pronatalist pressures still persist. With an extension of the period between menarche and marriage and an increasing emphasis upon monogamy, it is becoming increasingly important for a man to know that his future wife will be able to have children. Consequently, proof of pregnancy is becoming a pre-requisite for testing relationships with potential partners (Agounké et al., 1990; Gage and Bledsoe, in press; Dynowski-Smith, 1989; Karanja, 1987:250).
The objective of this paper is not to provide explanations for patterns of sexual behavior among unmarried women, or to rationalize extramarital sexual intercourse within a given social context. Rather, we examine whether the level of premarital sexual activity among adolescents has increased over time, and whether exposure to Western education has an impact on the likelihood of engaging in premarital sexual activity. In many studies it is argued that the mean age at first sexual intercourse is declining as a consequence of increasing levels of education. Since formal education exposes adolescents to Western values, bettereducated youths are more likely to adopt the ideals of romantic love and intimacy. Education may also contribute to the erosion of traditional constraints on premarital sexual relations, since it is more difficult for the extended family to control sexual behavior of adolescents who are in school (Cherlin and Riley, 1986; GyepiGarbrah, 1985). Differentials by level of education take on added significance as these may be indicative of potential

high-risk groups in terms of the health consequences of premarital sexual activity, and in terms of patterns of pregnancy and contraceptive use that may be expected among unmarried women in the near future.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA
The data come from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of Botswana, Burundi, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Togo, and Zimbabwe, which were conducted between 1986 and 1989. Questions on sexual activity in the DHS collected information from women of reproductive age on the age at first intercourse and on the time elapsed since the respondent last had sexual intercourse. An additional question enquiring about the frequency of intercourse in the four weeks prior to the survey was also included in the surveys in Burundi, Ghana, and Kenya. Given that in most African societies the large majority of women are married by age 25, the study focuses on the sexual behavior of unmarried women aged 15-24. For the purpose of analysis, they have been further classified into four age groups which in a given social context may represent a gradation in social tolerance for sexual activity and childbearing among unmarried women ages 15-17, 18-19, 20-21, and 22-24.
In research on sexual activity, concerns about data quality go beyond the usual problems of age misreporting which are typical of many African cultures where people do not know their exact age and are unable to report the dates of vital events accurately (Blanc

and Rutenberg, 1990; 1991, pp. 163165). In cultures where premarital sexual intercourse is not tolerated, women may be reluctant to admit that they engaged in such behavior, and the possibility exists that their responses reflect normative rather than actual behavior. Although it is important to acknowledge that such biases may exist, they may not be problematic. Caraël et al. (1990) remark that not too long ago similar concerns were expressed about questions concerning contraceptive behavior, and those proved unwarranted. An appraisal of the utility of DHS data on sexual intercourse by Blanc and Rutenberg (1991, p. 164) concluded that "inaccuracies at the individual level have little discernible effect on aggregate measures; on average, only 10 per cent of the data are affected and, within that 10 per cent, errors in under- and overestimates tend to cancel each other out." While cautioning the user about analysis at the individual level, they conclude that aggregate measures do produce valid results.
In cross-country comparisons, estimates of the level of premarital sexual activity may also be affected by differences in the definition of marriage across cultures. In the DHS surveys, as in the World Fertility Surveys (WFS), a very broad definition of marriage was used that includes all more or less stable unions. However, in most African societies, it is not easy to arrive at a single definition of marriage, given the protracted nature of the marriage process and the variety of marriage customs that exist (Meekers, 1992; van de Walle, 1968; van de Walle and Meekers, in press). Reports of marital status have sometimes been found to

48

be biased by subjective assessments on the part of respondents. For example, Gage and Bledsoe (in press) found that educated women who had customary marriage ceremonies had a tendency to report themselves as single if these ceremonies had not been followed by a religious or civil ceremony involving the signing of a marriage certificate. These considerations must be borne in mind in the examination of differentials in premarital sexual activity across countries.
The information on sexual behavior is used to compute a dummy variable indicating whether or not nevermarried women ever had sexual intercourse. For ever-married women, we verify whether or not they had sexual intercourse before first marriage. This variable equals "one" if the respondent reports that her age at first sexual intercourse is at least one year less than her age at first marriage, zero, otherwise.1 Because information on the frequency of sexual intercourse is only available for three countries, the main indicator of recent sexual activity is a variable indicating whether or not the respondent had sexual intercourse in the seven days prior to the survey.
In this paper, we estimate the effect of level of education on these dependent variables. As is the case in all DHS surveys, the indicator of education is the highest level of education that the respondent ever attended (but not necessarily completed).
1Both age at first intercourse and age at first marriage are measured in completed years.

RESULTS
COHORT DIFFERENTIALS IN THE TIMING
OF FIRST INTERCOURSE, FIRST
MARRIAGE, AND FIRST BIRTH
Trends in premarital sexual exposure may be captured by examining patterns of sexual activity, marriage, and childbearing in successive cohorts (Blanc and Rutenberg, 1991). Table 1 shows that the proportion of women having first intercourse before age 20 has changed little over time in most countries. The only exception is Botswana where teenage sexual activity has increased slightly across cohorts. The pattern for teenage marriage is quite different. All countries have witnessed a significant decline in teenage marriage over time. In Kenya, for example, the proportion of women who first married in their teenage years has declined from 71 per cent among women aged 40-49 to 58 per cent among those aged 20-29 at the time of the survey.
In each country, the proportion of women having first intercourse before age 20 is higher than the proportion first marrying before age 20, and this pattern holds for all cohorts. This differential between teenage sexual experience and teenage marital experience has increased steadily over time in Botswana, Ghana, Liberia, and Kenya. Although the differential is greatest in Botswana, it is in Kenya that the increase in the sex-marriage gap is most striking. As a result of the increase in the age at first marriage, the proportion of women who become sexually active in their teenage years exceeds the proportion who married as teenagers by about 20 per cent for

While cohort trends in teenage sexual activity and marriage may reflect the relative displacement of dates of vital events, they do suggest in some countries an increasing tendency for women to engage in premarital sexual activity. This hypothesis is confirmed by Figure 1 which compares the per-

centage of women engaging in premarital sexual activity for the cohorts currently aged 20-29, 30-39, and 40-49. Nevertheless, despite the increase in premarital sexual activity, the graph reveals that in several of the countries analyzed here, premarital sexual intercourse among teenagers is not a new phenomenon as is often believed, but rather a continuation of a behavioral pattern that already existed in the past.

FIG. I.--Per cent of women engaging in premarital sexual intercourse during their teenage years.

In Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, and Liberia and Zimbabwe, sexual activity among unmarried teenagers was fairly prevalent two decades ago. Over 40 per cent of women aged 40-49 in these countries had engaged in premarital sexual intercourse as teenagers. InBurundi, sexual activity among unmarried teenagers is quite low and has changed little over time. In contrast, sexual activity among unmarried teenagers has increased over time in those countries where it was already common in the past (i.e., in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, and Liberia).

PREVALENCE OF PREMARITAL SEXUAL
EXPERIENCE
There are large differentials between countries in the prevalence of sexual experience among nevermarried women. In Botswana and Liberia, more than three out of every four never-married women report being sexually experienced. In Zimbabwe and Burundi, on the other hand, only 23 percent and4 per cent, respectively, of thenever-married women admitted to having had sexual intercourse. Figure 2 shows the percentage

of never-married women aged 15-24 who are sexually experienced, by age group. The propensity for unmarried women to engage in sexual activity increases steeply with age, doubling from age 15-17to age 18-19in Ghana, Kenya, and Zimbabwe. In the age group 22-24, over 95 per cent report sexual experience in Botswana and Liberia, as opposed to 59 per cent in Zimbabwe, and only 11per cent inBurundi. These differentials also hold for the youngest age group (15-17).
If we look at the percentage of evermarried women who report having premarital sexual intercourse by age at first marriage (see Figure 3), we find a similar pattern. As expected, the

higher the age at first marriage, the greater is the likelihood that women have engaged in premarital sexual intercourse. These data confirm that sexual initiation occurs at a very young age in most countries (e.g., Meekers, 1994). For example, in Togo and Kenya more than 25per cent of women who married before age 15 report having premarital sexual intercourse.
In the literature it has sometimes been suggested that increasing levels of education may be a factor contributing to the apparently high levels of sexual activity among unmarried youths. It is argued that education increases exposure to Western norms, increases the availability of potential

sexual partners, and reduces the control by the lineage elders over the sexual behavior of the unmarried, all of which may contribute to a decline in sexual mores among urban and bettereducated youths (Cherlin and Riley, 1986; Gyepi-Garbrah, 1985). If such is the case, it is expected that bettereducated girls will report higher levels of sexual experience than less-educated girls, after controlling for age.
Table 2 shows that the effect of education differs between countries. In Botswana, Ghana, and Liberia, the effect of education on the sexual experience of unmarried girls is small, albeit significant. In Kenya, the effect is cur-

vilinear with girls who attended primary education having the highest levels of sexual experience. In Burundi and Togo, sexual experience among never-married girls increases with the level of eduction, but in Togo there is little difference between girls who had only a primary-school education and those who had a secondary-school or higher education. Finally, in Zimbabwe, the percentage of never-married women who are sexually experienced declines with the level of education.
By way of comparison, Table 2 also shows the percentage of ever-married women aged 15-24 who admit to having had premarital sexual intercourse

by level of education, holding age at first marriage constant. More than half of ever-married adolescents had engaged in sexual intercourse before marriage except in Zimbabwe (43 per cent) and Burundi (16 per cent). In Kenya, Liberia, and Zimbabwe, education appears to have a curvilinear effect. Women who attended primary school are somewhat more likely to have had premarital sexual intercourse than either uneducated women or women with a secondary-school or higher education. As was the case for never-married women in Burundi and Togo, premarital sexual experience increases with level of education.
It is interesting that in Botswana and Liberia, the level of sexual experience among never-married women is higher than the level of premarital sexual in-

tercourse reported by ever-married women of the same age. This differential holds for all educational groups in these two countries, but is not observed in the other countries. One would expect that estimates of premarital sex among ever-married women would be higher than those based only on the experience of unmarried women because women who have definite marriage plans are more likely to engage in premarital intercourse. Most likely this high level of sexual experience among never-married women reflects the fact many women are involved in informal noncohabiting unions.

of education. The results are consistent with our previous findings. The mean age at first sexual intercourse is highest in Burundi and Zimbabwe (17.6 and 17.1 years of age, respectively), and lowest in Liberia (15.0). Somewhat surprisingly, the mean age at first sexual intercourse is lower in Togo than in Botswana (15.9 versus 16.4), although a higher percentage of never-married women are sexually experienced in Botswana than is the case in Togo (78 per cent versus 59 per cent, see Table 2). Age at first sexual intercourse increases by level of education in most countries, but the differences are rather small (less than one year). Except in Botswana, Kenya, and Zimbabwe, the differences in age at first sexual intercourse between uneducated women and women with secondary or higher education are less than half a year. In all countries, the mean age at first sexual intercourse for nevermarried women differs less than one year from that of ever-married women (not shown).
RECENT SEXUAL ACTIVITY
The fact that there are differences between countries in the onset of sex-

ual activity does not necessarily imply that there are also differences in sexual behavior once women have become sexually active. Table 4 shows the percentage of women who reported having intercourse in the week prior to the survey. The data reveal that countries with the highest prevalence of sexual activity among never-married women also record the highest occurrence of recent sexual activity in this subgroup (i.e., Botswana and Liberia). However, in Kenya, where nearly one out of every two never-married women is sexually experienced, only 11 per cent of sexually experienced unmarried women reported having sex in the week before the survey. The level of education is negatively associated with the percentage of women who had sex in the past seven days, but in most countries this effect is not significant.
Although one would expect a much lower prevalence of recent sexual activity among never-married than currently-married women, Figure 4 reveals that in Ghana and Liberia the difference is surprisingly small. About 21 per cent of sexually experienced unmarried Ghanaian women had sexual intercourse during the previous week,

as opposed to 28 per cent of those who were currently-married women. In Liberia, these percentages are 43 per cent and 53 per cent respectively. The low level of sexual activity among married women in Ghana has been attributed to postpartum abstinence (Blanc and Rutenberg, 1991). These findings also suggest that in these two countries never-married women may be involved in fairly stable sexual relationships. If these sexual relationships were not fairly stable, the temporary nature of the relationship between partners would most likely be reflected in a lower percentage of women who had sexual intercourse in the past week.
Information on the frequency of intercourse in the last month is only available for Burundi, Ghana, and Kenya. Education has no effect on the frequency of intercourse among nevermarried sexually experienced women (Table 5).2 In Burundi and Kenya, currently married women report a substantially higher frequency of intercourse than never-married sexually experienced women, but in Ghana the difference is small. The latter finding is consistent with the earlier finding that in Ghana never-married sexually experienced women are almost as likely to have had sexual intercourse in the past week as currently married women. There is no clear differential in the frequency of intercourse by age of the respondent.
2Burundi is omitted form Table 5 because the small number of sexually experienced nevermarried women does not permit a breakdown by level of education or age. However, coital frequency was considerably lower among the never-married adolescents (0.3) than among the ever-married (6.9).

NUMBER OF SEXUAL PARTNERS BEFORE
MARRIAGE
With the rapid spread of the AIDS epidemic in parts of Africa, focus on the consequences of sexual activity among unmarried women is shifting rapidly away from those surrounding contraceptive use, premarital childbearing, knowledge of the ovulatory period, and responsibilities for the maintenance of children born in informal unions to those surrounding the number of sexual partners before marriage. The DHS did not collect information on sexual networking, or on the sexual behavior of unmarried men. However, this information can be gleaned from small scattered studies and from a few preliminary reports of the World Health Organization adolescent fertility surveys. Much of the information does not differentiate between the married and the unmarried, nor is it restricted to adolescents.
Table 6 presents data on number of sexual partners before marriage for ever-married respondents in some communities of Ghana and southwestern Nigeria. Males have greater premarital sexual freedom than females as is portrayed by their higher number of sexual partners before marriage. In Nigeria, over 40 per cent of rural men and 24 per cent of urban men had 10 or more partners before marriage. Among females in both countries, the number of sexual partners before marriage appears to be considerably higher in urban than in rural areas, partly a reflection of higher urban age-at-firstmarriage. In the Nigerian sample, 23 per cent of urban females compared to 8 per cent of rural women had 5-9 partners before marriage. It was fur-

ther observed in Ghana that traditional prescriptions of virginity at marriage were no longer observed. Older females aged 50 years and over recorded a higher proportion of virgins at marriage than younger ones (Anarfi, 1991). Data from the Global Programme on AIDS/WHO surveys also revealed that never-married and formerly-married individuals showed a higher prevalence of casual/ commercial sex than the married, but that in Côte d'Ivoire, more than half of married men aged 15-29 reported casual sex, compared to 42 per cent and 26 per cent for those aged 30-39 and 40 years and over, respectively (Caraël et al., 1990). The same study also revealed that in Kenya, 33 per cent of respondents who had engaged in casual sex reported symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases in the last 12 months compared to 8 per cent of those who did not engage in casual sex.

DISCUSSION
The DHS data show that nevermarried women should be an important target group for family planning and AIDS awareness programs. Although the likelihood of engaging in sexual intercourse increases sharply with age, it is important to note that sexual activity often starts at a very young age. In some countries, such as Botswana and Liberia, over 40 per cent of never-married women aged 15-17 are sexually experienced. Contrary to the common belief that the spread of female education is one of the main factors causing an increase in the levels of premarital sexual activity, the DHS data show that in most countries education has no important effect on premarital sexual activity, after controlling for the age of the respondent. In most countries the mean age at first intercourse is very low, but higher

levels of education are associated with a later, rather than earlier, age at first sexual intercourse.
These results have important policy implications. From a health perspective, the high prevalence of sexual activity among unmarried women and the high number of sexual partners before marriage that is portrayed by the available data brings into focus the need for more in-depth data of a comparative nature about number of partners, casual/commercial sex, relative frequency of condom use, history of sexually transmitted diseases, and the importance of extending data collection on these aspects of sexual behavior to married and unmarried males.

The findings also highlight the need to provide family planning services to adolescents and to improve their knowledge of reproductive health in order to reduce the likelihood of unwanted pregnancies. Surveys in a number of countries have shown that unmarried teenagers make up a substantial proportion of women suffering from the complications of illicit abortions (e.g., Nichols et al., 1986). At present, population policies often devote little attention to the specific problems and needs of adolescents, especially if they are unmarried. Concerns that providing family life education to unmarried adolescents may encourage sexual immorality are misplaced, since a large

proportion of them are already sexually active. Hence, it is important not only to institutionalize family life education programs in countries where they have not already been implemented but also to expand them to elementary schools in order to reach adolescents before they become sexually active. These programs could be used as a platform for heightening awareness of reproductive physiology as well as high-risk sexual behaviors among adolescents and should be targeted at males as well as females.
