Epstein and Guttman (1987), in replying to James (1987), state that "If James means to limit his use of the adjective "superior" to scales of age, stature, IQ, education, and social class, perhaps he might present a more convincing argument by empirically substantiating it." They go on to say "we found no mention of actual differences--only correlations--between spouses on these variables."
My own work in a Cambridge urban area (Mascie-Taylor, 1977; MascieTaylor and Gibson, 1979; MascieTaylor, 1987) does lend some support to the notion of mean differences between spouses for a number of IQ and personality variables. For the total sample of 193 husband/wife pairs, the mean IQ's (using the Wechsler WAIS test) of husbands and wives were not significantly different. However, paired /-test comparisons of spouses' IQ scores revealed that husbands scored significantly higher than their wives on both verbal and nonverbal IQ components as well as total IQ score. This finding was replicated in both blue- and white-collar groups. These differences might reflect husband superiority. Husbands in this Cambridge sample also had significantly

more years of education than their wives. Since IQ and years of education are highly correlated, this result is not unexpected.
Previous researchers have found a sex difference when using the WAIS test (Harrison et al., 1976) but no such bias was found in this sample.
Finally, wives scored significantly higher on the neuroticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Inventory, but there were no differences in extraversion/introversion or inconsistency scales.
Is there not a case for determining the role of sex differences in mate selection?
