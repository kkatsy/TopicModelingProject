ABSTRACT: Recent research has examined the consequences of migration, with much of this work focusing on "boom" towns. This literature provides a useful framework for studying the consequences of population growth in other settings, however. The boom-town literature has generally used the social disruption hypothesis, which predicts social disruptions in communities growing rapidly through migration, to explain the results of migration in these communities. Suicide is one social disruption indicator which has not received much empirical attention. According to the social disruption hypothesis, a positive relationship is expected between the net migration and suicide rates. We examine this hypothesis using data from Texas nonmetropolitan counties for the last two decades. We also present separate analyses for metropolitan counties. The results fail to provide support for the hypothesis. There is generally no relationship between net migration and suicide rates in both nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties. Alternative explanations fail to alter this finding.

While much empirical attention has focused on the determinants of migration, only recently has research (e.g., Cortese and Jones, 1977; Price and Clay, 1980; Osborne et al., 1984; Krannich et al., 1985) begun examining the consequences of population growth. Much of this research has studied Western energy-development "boom" towns. These studies suggest that population growth in such communities results in social disruptions among residents and the communities' institutions and organizations (England and Albrecht, 1984), although there is some disagreement regarding the validity of such occurrences (Wilkinson et al., 1982).
In light of the migration turnaround of the 1970s, in .which nonmetropolitan areas grew more rapidly through migration than metropolitan areas, after the opposite trend throughout the prior part

of the century, it is important to begin to examine the presence or absence of social disruptions due to migration in other types of nonmetropolitan areas (e.g., non-"boom" towns). If it is true that migration creates disruptions in human lives and places strains on communities' institutions and organizations in meeting residents' service demands, then we would expect to observe relatively high degrees of social disorganization, such as suicide, in high-growth places.
Relatively little research has sought to determine the relationship between migration and suicide in nonmetropolitan areas, however. This study examines this relationship by primarily focusing on Texas' nonmetropolitan counties in the last two decades. These counties provide an excellent opportunity to conduct such an analysis since approximately three-fifths of the state's nonme-

BACKGROUND

The expanding population places strains

Much of the research examining the consequences of migration in nonmetropolitan areas has focused on Western energy-development boom towns. Although boom towns differ significantly from other nonmetropolitan communities with regard to their source and speed of population growth, population

itively related to residents' perceptions of problems in health care (including mental health and counseling services), educational programs and facilities, crime and public safety, municipal services, and social welfare programs in Michigan.
On the other hand, the findings are less supportive of the social disruption hypothesis at the individual level. Yet, some observers suggest that social disorganization arises with inmigration as social ties are transformed from primary ones to secondary ties. The forms of social disorganization attributed to migration include family disintegration (Kohrs, 1974; Freudenburg, 1978; Lantz and McKeown, 1979; Trovato, 1986i»), substance abuse (Gilmore and Duff, 1975; Freudenburg, 1978; Lantz and McKeown, 1979), increasing use of mental health services (Lantz and McKeown, 1979; Freudenburg et al., 1982), crime (Lantz and McKeown, 1979), increasing fear of crime (Krannich et al., 1985), and declining levels of community integration (Krannich and Greider, 1984).
However, the social disruption hypothesis has come under attack recently. Indeed, Wilkinson et al. (1982) questioned the validity of the findings, particularly early ones, that have been used to document support for the hypothesis. Other research has also failed to provide support for the social disruption hypothesis. For example, Krannich et al. (1985) failed to find any evidence of higher crime rates in several boom towns than in nonboom towns. In addition, England and Albrecht (1984) found that several boom town communities did not experience disruptions of social ties or declining informal ties. Furthermore, Krannich and Greider (1984) noted that boom town residents

did not report problems concerning stress and psychological distress. Similarly, Wilkinson et al. (1983) did not find a relationship between net migration and divorce rates in the Old West.
Although suicide constitutes an important indicator of social disruption, relatively little empirical attention has focused on this area. If, indeed, migration leads to social disruptions in the social ties that serve as support systems for people and if migration leads to pressures on the delivery of human services, then we would expect that incidences of suicide would increase under such conditions. One study that provides a systematic examination of the relationship between migration and suicide is that of Wilkinson and Israel (1984). Their results indicate that net migration and suicide rates are not significantly related in Northeast counties (nonmetropolitan and metropolitan). In addition, the findings of Kowalsi et al. (1987), while not primarily focusing on the relationship between net migration and suicide, show that the two variables are not significantly related among rural U.S. counties, although net migration and suicide are significantly positively related among urban counties. Furthermore, South's (1987) study of Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA's) demonstrates that the 1975-80 in-migration rate is positively related to the suicide rate, while the out-migration rate for the period is negatively related to the suicide rate. Other research has found a positive association between the percentage of interstate migrants and suicide (Stack, 1980; Trovato, 1986a), although such a measure of migration fails to take into account the number of people who left the area.
In sum, the literature focusing on the boom towns provides a useful perspec-

tive (i.e., the social disruption hypothesis) for understanding the consequences of population growth. We use this perspective to examine the relationship between net migration and suicide rates in Texas nonmetropolitan counties, while providing analysis for metropolitan counties for comparative purposes. The major focus on nonmetropolitan counties stems from the fact that the social disruption hypothesis has generally been based on nonmetropolitan boom towns. The social disruption hypothesis predicts a positive relationship between the net migration and suicide rates. In addition, this perspective would also argue that this relationship is likely to be more positive in the nonmetropolitan migration "turnaround" counties (e.g., net inmigration in the 1970's and net outmigration in the 1960's) than in nonmetropolitan "nonturnaround" counties because growth in the former counties islikely to represent a relatively new phenomenon. In order to determine whether shifts have occurred in the relationships between the net migration and suicide rates over time, we will examine the effects of the net migration rates of the 1960's and 1970's on the 1970 and 1980 suicide rates, respectively.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data used in this analysis come from three sources. First, the suicide data for Texas counties come from U.S. Vital Statistics for the years 1958-62, 1968-72 and 1978-82. Second, the net migration rates for the counties are taken from the net migration estimates of Bowles et al. (1975) and Hwang et al. (1985). Third, control variables included in the analysis (discussed below) come from the 1970 and 1980 censuses.
The dependent variables are the 1970

and 1980 suicide rates, defined as the number of suicides per 100,000 residents in each county in each year, respectively. Because of the relatively small number of suicides occurring in many counties, the suicide rates were derived by dividing the average number of suicides taking place in thefive-yearperiod surrounding 1970 (i.e., 1968-72) and 1980 (i.e., 1978-82) in each county by the county's 1970 and 1980 population, respectively, and then multiplying by 100,000.
Some caution should be taken in interpreting our results since the suicide rates are based on official statistical sources and could be affected by underreporting of suicides. Gibbs' (1971) investigation of coroners' reports and official suicide data, however, indicate that such data should not be abandoned in research because the measurement errors associated with these data tend to be smaller than is commonly believed. In addition, Pescosolido and Mendelsohn's (1986) detailed study of biases in the reporting of suicides and the consequences of such misreporting on the testing of sociological theories provides further support for the validity of suicide data. These researchers found that while suicides tend to be underreported, this problem generally does not affect the relationships (in magnitude or direction) between variables commonly used to test sociological suicide theories and suicide rates.
Our independent variables of major interest are the counties' 1960-70 and 1970-80 net migration rates. The net migration estimates are derived by applying the national census survival rates for the 1960-to-1970 and the 1970-to1980 periods to the 1960 and 1970 populations of each county, respectively. This produces the county's "expected"

In addition, we include five variables (as controls) which have been observed in the literature to be related to suicide. First, the percentage of the county's end-of-period (1970 and 1980) population 25 and older with a college degree (i.e., completed 16 or more years of schooling) is included as a proxy for social status. Research findings provide mixed support for the direction of the relationship between social status and suicide rates. For example, Trovato (1986a) suggests that populations having high percentages of persons with high socioeconomic statuses tend to

It should be pointed out that while research has shown that suicide rates tend to increase with age (Linden and Breed, 1976), this variable was not included in the analysis because of a relatively strong correlation between median age and percent minority. Correlational and multiple-regression analyses failed to find a significant relationship between the median age and the suicide rate in the Texas counties.

for nonmetro counties. For example, the 1960-70 and 1970-80 net migration rates are substantially higher in metro counties (means, 3.1 and 24.5, respectively) than in nonmetro counties (--9.5 and 7.1). Only one-fifth of nonmetro counties (classified as such in 1980) experienced net inmigration in the 196070 period, but the percentage increased to 60.5 per cent for the 1970-80 period (compared to 57.4 per cent and 88.9 per cent, respectively, for metro counties). In fact, while 28 per cent of metro counties had net inmigration flows in the three decades from 1950 to 1980, only 1.5 per cent of nonmetro counties could make this claim. As such, these statistics suggest that population growth through migration was a relatively new phenomenon for nonmetro counties in the 1970's.
These migration changes are particularly pronounced among nonmetro turnaround counties. The number of

nonmetro counties that experienced a migration turnaround (net outmigration in previous decade and net inmigration in later decade) more than doubled from 41counties in 1970to 85in 1980. In fact, only 8.7 per cent of the nonmetro turnaround counties (net outmigration in 1960-70 and net inmigration in 197080) had experienced net inmigration flows in the 1950's compared to 26.0 per cent among the nonmetro nonturnaround counties. These findings illustrate the recency of population growth through migration among the turnaround counties.
Given such changes, we can assess the extent to which net migration rates are related to suicide rates in nonmetro (and metro) counties. The results show that the 1970-80 net migration rate is not significantly related to the 1980 suicide rate in both nonmetro (b = -0.020) and metro (b = -0.002) counties (Table 2), suggesting that popula-

tion growth through migration has not resulted in social disruptions in the form of suicide in either type of county during this time. Similarly, the 1960-70 net migration rate is not significantly associated with the 1970 suicide rate in either nonmetro (b = 0.024) or metro (b = -0.040) counties.
Similarly, the 1970-80 net migration rate is not significantly related to the 1980 suicide rate among the nonmetro turnaround and nonturnaround counties. However, the 1960-70 net migration rate is positively and significantly related to the 1970 suicide rate among nonmetro turnaround counties (net outmigration in 1950-60 and net inmigration in 1960-70). Yet, this finding should be interpreted cautiously because of the relatively small number of counties (41) that were considered turnaround counties in 1970. In effect, we fail to find a significant relationship between the two variables in the 1970-80

period, when population growth through migration was taking place on a relatively-large scale in nonmetro areas. One can speculate that perhaps turnaround counties in the 1970's, because of their larger number (85) than their counterparts a decade earlier (41), had more models (other counties) from which they could draw knowledge regarding strategies for coping with population growth. The turnaround counties of the 1960's may have had a more limited source of information on dealing with possible consequences of such growth.
Several control variables are significantly related to suicide. The percentage of the 1980population living outside of Texas in 1975 is positively related to the 1980 suicide rate in nonmetro counties (b = 0.288) and nonmetro nonturnaround counties (b = 0.459) and negatively related to suicide in metro counties (b = -0.143) (Table 2).

curvilinear manner and that net migration measure masks the volume of population movement that actually took place--were examined to determine whether our failure to find a relationship between migration and suicide could be a result of these factors. The alternative explanations were not substantiated.
While our findings fail to lend support to the social disruption hypothesis, does this necessarily signify that Texas nonmetropolitan counties--and metropolitan ones for that matter--did not experience social disturbances as a result of heavy inmigration in the last two decades? The answer to this question is a definite "no." Indeed, we have only examined one of a whole series of indicators of social disruption. It may be that social disturbances have occurred in other areas, such as divorce, crime, substance abuse, weakening of community integration, strains on the delivery of social services, or pressures on community facilities. Further analyses are needed in order to determine the degree to which Texas counties have been effective in dealing with population growth. While secondary data may be used in future analyses, primary data are of utmost importance in seeking to gauge factors such as community integration and the disruption of social ties.
At the same time, the possibility exists that the social disruption hypothesis developed to account for the consequences of migration in boom towns does not apply to other areas. It is obvious that boom towns and non-boom towns are likely to differ significantly in various ways. For instance, the migrants moving into boom towns are likely to have particular characteristics associated with the employment opportunities

in the area. Mining communities, thus, are likely to attract male workers, with some of these also relocating their families to the area. In such instances, the new residents are likely to possess avariety of characteristics that differ significantly from those of the "old timers," which may be an older population due to past outmigration. In addition, the speed at which population growth occurred is likely to be more dramatic in boom towns than in other types of communities. Hence, these factors suggest that the levels of adjustment necessary to cope with changes brought on by migration are likely to be relatively more dramatic in boom towns.
Finally, while the positive consequences of migration are often overshadowed by the negative occurrences in the literature, it is important to realize that migration can also have positive benefits for the receiving areas. For instance, the new residents may bring in expertise in areas (e.g., education, politics, and health care) that are badly needed in the nonmetropolitan communities. In addition, while the inmigrants place strains on the delivery of goods and services in the community, they also may have a positive impact on the employment situation, as more job slots may need to be created to meet the residents' increasing demands. Hence, it could be that the migrants themselves are able to help communities adjust to the changing conditions brought about by their entrance into the area.
