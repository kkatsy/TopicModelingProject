The Terena are the descendents of one of the subgroups of the Arawak-speaking Guan£. In pre-Colombian times they moved southward into the northern Chaco from the Amazon Basin. They remained there until the second half of the eighteenth century when they crossed the Paraguay River in successive waves and established themselves in the Brazilian region bathed by the Miranda River in the southern part of the state of Mato Grosso. Their present location is still this general region, between latitude 20°-22° south and longitude 54°-58° west.
From a demographic point of view they are remarkable among Brazilian Indians, since in contrast to other tribes which experienced a marked decline the Terena are increasing in number. The migrating groups of the eighteenth century were estimated as comprising about 3,000 persons; the present Terena population numbers about 5,000 individuals distributed over some twelve villages (Cardoso de Oliveira, 1960). The present report analyzes some demographic data of genetic interest collected by one of us in the village of Cachoeirinha, as part of a broader study dealing with the process of Terena sociocultural assimilation into the Brazilian society (Cardoso de Oliveira, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1965/66, 1968).
Due to more than 150 years of contact

with Neo-Brazilians they have acquired habits and customs of the latter, but still maintain to a varying degree many features of their traditional culture in the several local groups they form. The population of Cachoeirinha was chosen for this detailed study after a survey was made of all the villages. The survey indicated that this community was one of the most conservative, but still suffered processes of change that could be profitably investigated.
The analysis to be reported below is a further contribution to a long-term project aiming at the characterization of the population structure of South American Indians living in different stages of culture change. The questions being asked are: (1) To what extent do groups of hunters and gatherers differ in basic demographic parameters from populations of agriculturalists? (2) In what way do these differences affect their genetic variability?1
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The main population center of Cachoeirinha is located some eight kilometers from the railroad station of Duque de Estra-

da and 18 kilometers from the small city of Miranda in southern Mato Grosso, Brazil. The village, with S3 houses, was built inside an Indian reservation of 2,260 hectares, measured and delimited in 1905. Two other nearby groups of houses are identified by the names of Argola and Capao and many other families live scattered in different places. However, the Indian population of the reservation can be considered as a unit. Terena Indians have lived in this place since the end of the eighteenth century. The first census of Cachoeirinha was taken by the Indian Protective Service in 1919 and revealed 228 persons. Subsequently other cen-

these values with those summarized in De Oliveira and Salzano (1969) and Salzano, Moreno, Palatnik and Gershowitz (1970), we see that of six other South American Indian populations only one (the Juruna) showed a higher percentage of individuals in that age interval. As far as the sex ratio is concerned, the Terena and all groups summarized in the two above-mentioned studies show a value higher than 100. This can be expected in populations with predominantly young individuals. However, the differences in sex ratio in the three age groups shown in Table 1 are difficult to explain. As expected, the mortality data showed an excess

Field work among these Indians was performed by Dr. Cardoso de Oliveira in 1955, 1957, 1958, and 1960 totaling about one year of actual time spent in the field. Most of the results to be reported here were obtained from a census made in 1957, but mortality data includes information gathered in 1957 and 1960.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows data about age and sex distribution. The mean age of the Terena is low, with a high percentage (45%) of individuals in the 0-14 age category. Comparing

of deaths among men (109/205 or 53%). A total of 88.6% of the individuals were
identified as putatively "pure" Indians (Table 2). While the great majority are Terena, there are also a few Layana, Kinikinao, and products of crosses between these tribes.
Information about inter-racial marriages and endogamy is given in Tables 3 and 4. The observed frequencies of Indian X Mestizo and Indian X Neo-Brazilian unions agree well with those to be expected in a population with a racial composition as given in Table 2. On the other hand, the Indian population of Cachoeirinha is the most exogamic of all tribes tested so far. Since 46% of the marriages involved people born outside the community, Cachoeirinha can be regarded

among these groups, we trust that the figures are not too far from the true values. The mean number of live births per married individual over the age of IS is very high (4.8) compared with the following figures from other South American tribes: Bororo, 3.0; Xavante, 3.1; Juruna, 3.2; Mac£, 3.4; and Caingang, 4.5. The Terena figure for the mean number of live-born offspring in completed sibships (Table 6) is also high (5.5). Of four other South American tribes, only

one (the Caingang, with 6.1) presents a higher value.
As shown in Table 7, the average number of offspring surviving at the time of the census per female who had at least one liveborn child is 3.8. This corresponds to a decrease of only 21% in relation to the average number of live births, a moderate mortality rate if we consider that values as high as 58% were reported among the Kuikuro (Ribeiro, 1956).

ber of surviving offspring in completed families (4.2) is the highest so far recorded in South American Indians (previous results: Xavante, 3.1; Maca, 2.4; and Yanomama, 2.2) (see Table 8).
The breeding size of the Terena population (number of actual progenitors) is 362 (Table 9), that is, 39% of the total population, and its effective size (Li, 1955) can be estimated as 222 (24% of the total). The

population cannot be considered the breeding unit. Due to these peculiarities, they show a very low index of total selection intensity, the relative contributions of mortality and fertility to the index being practically equal.
One of the questions posed in the introduction can now be considered. What is the extent of the differences in basic demographic parameters between hunters and gatherers

relative proportions of these three parameters are of the same order of magnitude as the ones observed among other South American tribes. The index of selection intensity (Crow, 1958) obtained for the Terena (0.63) is very low (about half of that calculated for the Caingang and lower than the ones obtained for other tribes (see Salzano, 1963; Neel and Chagnon, 1968; Salzano et al, 1970),
DISCUSSION
The main features of Terena demography can therefore be described as follows: It is a relatively young, increasing population. The first census performed there occurred in 1919. In the 38 years which elapsed from that date until our census was made, the population quadrupled. Part of this increase was due to immigration, but the high fertility and low mortality no doubt also contributed to this high rate of increase. The sex ratio is relatively high, and the Terena present some intermixture with non-Indian persons. Exogamy is high and the local

on one hand and agriculturalists on the other? Data are slowly accumulating in South America for groups at these two stages of cultural development. For hunters and gatherers (with incipient agriculture) we have information about the Xingu Indians (Ranke, 1898), Kuikuro (Ribeiro,. 1956), Xavante (Salzano, Neel and Maybury-Lewis, 1967), Yanomama (Neel and Chagnon, 1968) and Juruna (De Oliveira and Salzano, 1969).

The application of Crow's (1958) index to tribal, state, andnational populations showed that this may notbenecessarily true, and that at least the opportunity for selection some* times exists as much in hunting and gathering as in agricultural or industrialized societies. This is not to saythat selective pressures remained unchanged during the whole process of our cultural development. Some
