While the primary, culturally endorsed prototype for parenthood in the United States is one of marriage, followed by conception and birth, recent studies (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969; U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1968a) have shown substantial departure from this traditional childbearing pattern and deviations in timing within different patterns.
Two deviations of the marriage-conception-birth sequence will be considered here: premaritally conceived births (babies who were conceived before the marriage of their biological parents but whose birth certificate was registered as legitimate, i.e., carrying nondiscrepant parent surnames), and out-of-wedlock births (babies who were conceived and born outside of marriage and whose birth certificate indicated no father's name or discrepant surnames for mother and father).
Although in all past and present societies, some proportion of marital births occur soon after marriage and are likely to have been premaritally conceived (Monahan, 1960), the extent of premarital conception, the societal reaction, and personal

and social consequences of the phenomenon have been noted to be different (Christensen, 1960). Premaritally conceived births in some countries are very common and have been interpreted as a component of a stable and integrated cultural pattern with few undesirable personal and social sequelae (Christensen, 1960; Croog, 1952), while in others the phenomenon is less frequent and is thought of as being socially deviant, necessitating hasty marriages and increasing the probability of marital dissolution (Christensen, 1960, 1963). Different timing patterns of conception after marriage and variations in frequency of premarital conception are generally considered as prime examples of cultural relativism in effect (Christensen, 1960).
Cultural reactions to differential timing of birth after marriage must be distinguished from the historically dominant attitudes toward out-of-wedlock births. While most communities are relatively tolerant about nonmarital conceptions as long as marriage is forthcoming (Monahan, 1960), there is little historical evidence that any society has formally condoned illegitimate fertility (Davis, 1939; Malinowski, 1930).

Births outside of wedlock have been considered in a variety of cultural contexts. Illegitimacy has been interpreted as an absolute violation of the universal "principle of legitimacy" (Malinowski, 1930), a form of deviant behavior which is always accompanied by penalties for the persons involved. A less severe interpretation of the phenomenon is one which states that illegitimacy need not always represent family disorganization or instability but rather that common-law marriage, matriarchal childrearing, and absorption of children born out-of-wedlock into extended families may be the "equivalent" of marriage (Roberts, 1966; Rodman, 1963; Lewis, 1959).
Premaritally conceived and illegitimate first births have been associated with demographic and personal consequences. A delay in childbearing after marriage has been related to a rise in the mean age of motherhood and an abatement of the rate of population growth (Pohlman, 1968; Freedman and Coombs, 1966; Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966; Coale and Tye, 1961). Conversely, it has been suggested that an increase in the proportion of births which occur to young mothers relatively soon after marriage may negate this effect and lead to a maintenance or rise of current growth levels (Pohlman, 1968).
From the point of view of the individual parents, there are data to support the hypothesis that postponement of parenthood is associated with increased opportunity for education, capital formation, control over fertility, better marital adjustment and lower probability of divorce (Coombs et al., 1970; Pohlman, 1968; Freedman and Coombs, 1966; Christensen, 1963) and that nonmaritally conceived fertility (illegitimate and premaritally conceived births) is related to interrupted education, decreased financial potential, higher total fertility, and--should marriage ensue--

greater likelihood of marital dissolution. It is frequently stated that nonmaritally conceived children, particularly those born out of wedlock, are more likely than maritally conceived children to be unplanned and unwanted, have a greater chance of being born with physical handicaps associated with poor prenatal care, and have diminished life chances in terms of potential for educational, occupational, and economic advancements because of an unstable or incomplete family environment (Farley and Hermalin, 1971; Teele and Schmidt, 1970; Berkov, 1968; Anderson, Masher, and Richter, 1966; Patker et al., 1961).
CURRENT STATUS OF KNOWLEDGE
National estimates on the annual frequency of illegitimacy, based on data supplied by those states which report statistics on out-of-wedlock births to the National Center for Health Statistics (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1968a), reveal that there has been a steady increase for both white and nonwhite populations in the absolute number of illegitimate births, their proportion of all births, and their number per 1,000 unmarried and total women ages 15-44. One exception to this general statement is the slight decline in the latter part of the 196070 decade in the number of nonwhite illegitimate births per 1,000 unmarried women ages 15-44. Markedly higher agespecific illegitimacy rates and ratios are evident for nonwhite mothers. The highest illegitimacy ratios, or the number of illegitimate births per 1,000 total births, are noted in the maternal age groups under 20, primarily due to the comparatively few marital births among women in this age group coupled with the high proportion of unmarried women "at risk" of an illegitimate birth. The highest illegitimacy rates, or the number of illegitimate births per

1,000 unmarried or total women, are noted for women in their twenties.
Data on the frequency of premaritally conceived births in the United States, as well as in most other countries, are not as readily available as illegitimacy statistics because of the inaccessibility of longitudinal data on the childbearing patterns of marriage cohorts. With the exception of vital statistics systems such as that in Denmark (Goldstein, 1967; Croog, 1952), there is usually no item on birth certificates relating to the date of marriage of parents and no simple way to establish the marriage duration of each year's births. American researchers interested in investigating the frequency of premaritally conceived births in the United States have chosen in the past between (a) large scale national surveys (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1970; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969; Whelpton et al., 1966) where marriage and birth dates are collected through personal interviews or mailed questionnaires, or (b) small record linkage studies (Siker and Fritch, 1967; Christensen, 1960, 1963; Pratt, 1965a) which bring together the birth certificate of the child and the marriage record of the parents.
Each of the two methodologies for gathering data on the marriage-to-first birth interval has limitations. The interview and questionnaire approach has been shown (Pratt, 1965a) to understate the frequency of short marriage-birth intervals because of the tendency of couples who conceive before marriage to misrepresent the date of their wedding. Pratt (1965a,b) compared dates of marriage and first birth as reported in the Detroit area study interviews with the dates that appeared on vital records and noted a distinct tendency for couples who were likely to have conceived before marriage to obscure the true dates.

The vital-data linkage technique has the definite advantage of increasing the accuracy of the interval data. Because of the time-consuming nature of hand linkage of vital records, however, this methodology is generally limited in both its temporal scope and geographic boundaries. It has been suggested that the bias introduced by nonlinkage due to the occurrence of marriage and birth in different locations leads to a general underestimation of early births as premarital pregnancy may be associated with migration, either because of the stigma attached to it or to socioeconomic factors related to precipitant marriage and early parenthood (Goldstein, 1967; Siker, 1967; Christensen, 1960). No formal analysis of the type of bias due to nonlinkage has been presented.
The limited data derived from vitalrecord linkage and survey-based research document the observation that premaritally conceived first births represent a substantial minority of all legitimate first births in the United States and suggest that premaritally conceived births in the early 1960's represent a larger portion of all legitimate first births than they did in the previous three decades. To date little effort has been made, however, to (a) provide vital-data-based statistics on a national or local level on the frequency and characteristics of premaritally conceived births in the latter part of the 1960-70 decade and (b) investigate the complementary relationship of the two components of nonmaritally conceived fertility and the effect of differential likelihood of marriage following out-of-wedlock conception on the frequency of illegitimacy.

of knowledge in both subject areas stimulated this investigation into nonmaritally conceived first births in Massachusetts, 1966-68.
Specific research goals were set forth:
1. Presentation of vital-data-based statistics onthe frequency of (a)premaritally conceived births and (b) illegitimate first births to Massachusetts couples inthe 1966-68 period.
2. Analysis of variation in frequency and timing of premaritally conceived first births in relation to thedate of marriage by maternal age, race, residence, occupational status, and the type of wedding ceremony.
3. Anevaluation of thetype of bias introduced into a vital-data record linkage study by the occurrence of marriage and birth in different locations.
4. Examination of the complementary relationship of premaritally conceivedand out-of-wedlock first births.
The statistical data presented here refer only to births to residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the three-year span under study. However, we hope this information will contribute to the general knowledge of the frequency and characteristics associated with illegitimate and premaritally conceived first births, the methodology used to study these phenomena, and the complementary relationships

between the two components of nonmaritally conceived fertility.
As is seen in Figure 1, there are two sources of natality and marriage data in Massachusetts: the Office of the Secretary of State and the Department of Public Health. Materials from both sources were used in thepresent study.
Massachusetts is one of the ten states which does not include the legitimacy status of the child or the marital status of the mother on the birth certificate and does not report data onout-of-wedlock births to the National Center for Health Statistics.1 Certificates of Massachusetts births, presumed to be illegitimate because of the absence of a father's name or a discrepancy between thesurname of the mother and the father, are bound separately as restricted records in the Office of the Secretary of State. The restricted records of the 1966 to 1968 period were examined and asystematic sample of the presumed illegitimate births to Massachusetts resident mothers was drawn. Twenty per cent of births to white mothers age 15 and over and 4 0 ^
1As of 1968 there were 10states not reporting statistics on theannual frequency of births out of wedlock. In theimmediately preceding years there were 16states not reporting data.

of births to nonwhite mothers age IS and over were included in the sample for each year. All certificates indicating a maternal age of under IS at delivery were included (Whelan, 1971a, b). The maternal ageand race were abstracted from each certificate. A mother was considered to be nonwhite if her color was described on her child's birth certificate as Negro, black, yellow, or Indian. It was not possible to include birth order as a study variable as this item was not completed on the certificate of about half of the births occurring in 1966-68.
For the same three years, an age-race stratified, systematic sample of legitimate first births to Massachusetts residents was drawn. A computer program selected the sample from a magnetic tape which carried the relevant statistical information on all Massachusetts births occurring in these years (see Table 1). Age and race stratification was used for two reasons. First, the population of Massachusetts is less than 3 % nonwhite and in order to assure an adequate sample size for this portion of the population, it was necessary to oversample this racial group. Second, premaritally conceived first births have been reported to be associated with young maternal age (Siker, 1967; Pratt, 1965 a, b). In order to assure numbers amenable to detailed analysis of this phenomenon, mothers under age 19

were oversampled. The small number of 1966-68 first babies for whom no race or age data were indicated were excluded. The age-race specific sampling proportions are described in Table 2.2
It was necessary to remove from thesample 45 births which occurred out of state and were coded in such a way that no linkage could be made to a birth certificate, 24 births which were illegitimate and were included because of coding errors in the preparation of the magnetic birth tape, and 1,182 births which were subsequently discovered to be of higher than first order. The inclusion of higher-order births in the initial sample resulted because of the Office of Health Research practice of coding all birth certificates which were blank with regard to parity as first births, a system which overstated the frequency of first births in the Commonwealth. All sample birth certificates which had no definite birth order were traced to the hospital of delivery where parity information was abstracted from the maternity record. Births of higher than first order were dropped. The final sample consisted of 2,927 white and 772 nonwhite legitimate first births occurring

in Massachusetts to Massachusetts residents.
Assuming that the proportion of "ineligible" births in the sample (illegitimate, out of state occurrence, and higher order) was the same in age and race subgroups in the total births reported as legitimate first births (Table 1), the final sample represents the true universe of first births in the original proportions. Table 2 presents both the final sample and the total estimated frequency of legitimate first births occurring in Massachusetts to Massachusetts residents, 1966-68.
The parents' names were linked with the data processing card for each first birth and a search was made of the Massachusetts marriage indices for the ten years prior to and one year after the birth.3 To increase the overall number of births matched with marriage records and to evaluate the bias introduced by nonmatch due to out-of-state marriages, the search for marriage records was extended to Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and New York (excluding New York City).

is, when the name of the bride and the groom corresponded with that of the mother and the father on the natality form, the marriage certificate was consulted and the information on age, occupation, number of previous marriages of the bride and groom, the date of the wedding and type of ceremony was recorded.
RESULTS
ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS
Weighting the number of illegitimate births in the sample by the age-race specific sampling proportions, estimates were made of the total presumed out-of-wedlock births occurring in 1966-68 to Massachusetts residents. Table 3 summarizes the findings and relates the frequency of out-of-wedlock births to all Massachusetts resident live births (illegitimacy ratio).
Since a high proportion of the 1966-68 Massachusetts birth certificates had no indication of the parity status of the mother,4 it was necessary to estimate the number of first-order illegitimate births by assuming that the distribution by birth order of out-of-wedlock births to Massachusetts residents in each maternal age and race group was the same as the maternal-age

It is not possible to be sure about the premarital conception of each individual baby. Any estimate of the proportion of legitimate first births premaritally conceived is likely to include erroneously some maritally conceived births in the premarital conception category and exclude from the premaritally conceived group a number of babies whowere actually conceived prior to the wedding of their parents. In an effort to minimize the number of false positive cases of premarital conception, Definition 2 at the 90th percentile, which yielded the most conservative estimate of PMC births, was used in the detailed analyses which follow.

Maternal age and race.--Table 6 presents estimates, by maternal age and race of the child, of the percentage of sample legitimate first births premaritally conceived and the mean interval (in days) between marriage and the birth of the child. For both whites and nonwhites, there is a significant difference among maternal age groups (p < 0.001) in the proportion of legitimate first births which were conceived premaritally. As maternal age increased, the proportion decreased.
When legitimate first births were compared within specific maternal age groups, nonwhite babies born to mothers ages 2024 showed a significantly higher proportion premaritally conceived than did white babies to mothers of the comparable age

nomvhite births and the date of the marriage of the parents. Parents of PMC white babies married relatively soon after the conception with the greatest number of marriages occurring approximately 60 days after conception. The timing of marriage in relationship to the conception of nonwhite PMC births was more diffuse, with the greatest number of marriages occurring some ISO days after conception.
Out-oj-state marriage.--In order to avoid the stigma attached to an early birth, couples who conceived before marriage may marry in a place other than where their first child is to be born (Siker, 1967; Pratt, 1965a). Although couples married in Massachusetts demonstrate a lower proportion of PMC births (Table 7), the differences within individual maternal age groups in the proportion of premarital conception among white first births occurring to couples married in Massachusetts and those married outside Massachusetts are not statistically significant (p < 0.30).
Type of marriage ceremony.--Massachusetts first-born babies whose parents were married in a religious ceremony were less likely to have been conceived premaritally than were first-born babies whose parents

were married in a civil ceremony. This difference is statistically significant for white babies born to mothers of maternal ages over 19 years, and nonwhite mothers of maternal ages 20-24 years (p > 0.001). As is shown in Table 8, not only were first children of parents married in civil ceremonies more likely to be premaritally conceived, but they were also born sooner after the wedding than those of parents married in religious ceremonies. This difference is significant (p < 0.001) for white babies born to women of maternal ages 1824 years.
Within age and race subgroups there are no significant differences in the proportion of PMC first babies when parents married in Catholic and Protestant ceremonies are compared. When white and nonwhite babies born to mothers ages 20-24 who were married in a Catholic ceremony are compared, the significant differences previously noted between the races in that maternal age group (p < 0.001) in the proportion of PMC births disappear (/>>0.76). The difference between the races in the timing of marriage in relationship to the PMC birth is sustained (p < 0.001). The difference in proportion

Occupation of the bride and groom at time of marriage.--Brides of both races who were employed at the time of the wedding have a lower proportion of PMC first births than do brides whose occupation was listed on the marriage record as "at home" (Table 9), a difference which reaches statistical significance among white births to mothers ages 17-24 years and among nonwhite births to mothers ages 20-24. White and nonwhite PMC births to mothers ages 20-24 who were not employed at the time of their marriage were born sooner after the wedding than were PMC births to mothers who were employed in either white or blue collar positions (p < 0.01).9
Within age categories, a higher proportion of first births to students were premaritally conceived than were first births to couples who were employed as blue or white collar workers at the time of their wedding.

There is no significant difference in the proportion of PMC births to employed brides and grooms when white and blue collar parents were compared. Premaritally conceived first children, however, of mothers and fathers engaged in blue collar work at the time of their marriage were born sooner after the wedding than were PMC first children of white collar workers, a difference which is statistically significant for white births to mothers ages 20-24 at time of delivery (p < 0.03).

NONMARITALLY CONCEIVED FIRST BIRTHS
Relationship of premaritally conceived and illegitimate first births.--Table 11 shows that 30.6% of white and 63.9% of nonwhite first births occurring in 1966-68 were nonmaritally conceived, and were born outside of, before, or within 252 days of marriage. Some 71.7% of white and 33.3% of nonwhite nonmaritally conceived first births were legitimated by marriage prior to their birth.
DISCUSSION
The systematic stratified samples of outof-wedlock births and legitimate first births

occurring 1966-68 to Massachusetts residents were selected in a manner designed to afford unbiased estimates of the extent of illegitimate and premaritally conceived legitimate first births. It is acknowledged, however, that unknown sampling biases may undermine the representativeness of the sample. Furthermore, there are two factors which may affect the internal validity of the samples: (1) The out-ofwedlock births studied did not include illegitimate births occurring out of state to Massachusetts residents, as no record of these events is filed in the restricted records of the Massachusetts Secretary of State. This exclusion may understate the frequency of illegitimate births to Massachusetts residents. (2) The 16.8% of white and 32.1% of nonwhite legitimate first births which were not linked with parents' marriage records may tend to underestimate the proportion of legitimate first births occurring before or very shortly after marriage. The unmatched births could be a product of a marriage which occurred in a state other than Massachusetts or the seven Northeast states where research was conducted. The data in Table 7 suggest that the direction of the bias introduced

Vol. 19, No. 1

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

by out-of-state marriage is toward understatement of PMC births. There is also the possibility that the parents of babies for whom no linkage with a marriage record was made were actually never married, and the mother falsified her child's birth certificate.
Data on the frequency of illegitimacy among first-order births collected in the current study are similar to that presented elsewhere (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1968a; Berkov, 1968). It is difficult to compare the Massachusetts data on PMC legitimate first births with previously published data on the subject because of different methodologies and definitions of premarital pregnancy employed in the study of premarital conception. A number of earlier studies (Pratt, 1965a; Christensen, 1960, 1963a), for instance, estimated the proportion of brides in first marriages who were pregnant at or before their marriage. Since these estimates using marriage cohorts as denominators would include infertile as well as fertile couples and include births originally registered as illegitimate and subsequently legitimated by marriage of their natural parents, they cannot be compared to the estimates of the proportion of legitimate first births which were conceived prior to the marriage of the parents.
The results of two studies are comparable to these Massachusetts data: (1) the estimates made through record-linkage techniques of PMC first births to Connecticut teenage mothers (Siker, 1967) are very similar to the present estimates; (2) data from the National Natality Survey (U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1970), gathered through questionnaires mailed to some 3,000 women having legitimate first births in the United States between 1964 and 1966, indicate that 19.5% of white births and 41.6% of

nonwhite births were premaritally conceived (occurred within eight months or less of marriage duration). When the comparable definition of premarital conception is employed, 26.4% of white and 42.4% of nonwhite Massachusetts legitimate first births were conceived prior to the marriage of their parents. The greater proportion of premarital conception among Massachusetts first births may be related to a real difference in frequency of PMC births in the two populations or may be a result of the different methodologies employed. Since it has been demonstrated previously (Pratt, 1965a) that the survey method of gathering marriage and birth dates tends to understate the frequency of short marriage-birth intervals because of the tendency of couples who conceive before marriage to misrepresent the date of their wedding, it is likely that differences between Massachusetts and United States estimates are primarily due to the greater capability of record-linkage techniques in identifying PMC births.
ILLEGITIMATE FIRST BIRTHS (CONCEPTION--BIRTH--MARRIAGE
OR NO MARRIAGE)
White and nonwhite women of maternal ages under 20 demonstrated a higher than usual frequency of illegitimate births, as measured by the illegitimacy ratio (Table 3) and the first-order illegitimacy ratio (Table 4). The discrepancies between age groups is partly due to the fact that the illegitimacy ratio in a given age group is not only a function of the number of illegitimate births (numerator) but also of those factors affecting the denominator: the number of women of childbearing age, the proportion of women married, and the level of marital and nonmarital fertility. Illegitimacy ratios are higher among teenagers because there are comparatively few marital births among women in this age group

24

while there is a high proportion of unmarried women "at risk" of an illegitimate pregnancy. When comparing illegitimacy rates, which relate the number of illegitimate births to the unmarried female population, Massachusetts women of both races age 20-29 demonstrate a higher rate of births out of wedlock than do women under age 20 (Whelan, 1971a).
At each maternal age a higher proportion of all births and estimated first births to nonwhite women, as compared with white women, were shown to be out of wedlock (Tables 4 and S). The racial discrepancy in frequency of illegitimacy has been analyzed at each of the steps which preceded an out-of-wedlock birth: the probability of the intercourse, the likelihood of conception, and the nature of resolution of the nonmarital pregnancy (Zelnik and Kantner, 1970). Although there are no empirical data on the differences in frequency of premarital intercourse among white and nonwhite women, or on birth control usage among unmarrieds, recent small-scale interview studies have suggested that a black female is more likely than her white counterpart to engage in premarital intercourse and less likely to employ contraception (Zelnik and Kantner, 1970). Further, it has been suggested that after the occurrence of an out-of-wedlock conception, nonwhites are less likely to resort to abortion or marriage as a means of terminating or legitimating a pregnancy (Cutright, 1971; Zelnik and Kantner, 1970; Pratt, 1965a). Nonwhites may be more prone than whites to reject abortion as an alternative for coping with an illegitimately conceived pregnancy because of cultural, religious, or economic factors, or a combination thereof (Zelnik and Kantner, 1970). The differential use of marriage by whites and nonwhites as a means of coping with an illegitimate conception and its effects

on racial differences in frequency of illegitimacy will be discussed in the next section.
PREMARITALLY CONCEIVED LEGITIMATE FIRST BIRTHS (CONCEPTION-- MARRIAGE--BIRTH)
Births of before 196 days of marriage, and those in the 196-251 days marriageduration range with weights higher than would be expected at that gestational age, were designated as premaritally conceived. This definition is conservative compared to those used in previous investigations (Siker, 1967; Pratt, 1965 a, b; Christensen, 1960, 1963). It was felt that births of over 251 days marriage duration, although a number may have been premaritally conceived, were of less social and demographic interest as they were less likely to have precipitated a marriage, but rather to have preceded an already scheduled wedding. Even the most liberal of the four definitions in Table 5, however, very probably understates the actual frequency of premaritally conceived first births in the sample.
A nonmarital conception which terminates in live birth may either be (a) born outside of marriage as an illegitimate child or be (b) born in wedlock as a legitimate baby. The illegitimacy ratio is in part a function of the marriage behavior of pregnant unmarried women. As is evident in Table 11, the majority (72%) of mothers of white nonmaritally conceived first births resolve the illegitimate conception by marriage prior to the birth. This is not true for nonwhite births: one-third of nonwhite nonmaritally conceived first births occur within wedlock. The diminished tendency of nonwhites to marry after an out-of-wed-' lock conception contributes substantially to the higher illegitimacy ratios of this group. As shown in Table 11, while illegitimate first-birth ratios (the number of first-order illegitimate births per 1,000 total

Vol. 19, No. 1

Premaritally Conceived First Births

first-order births) are approximately five times higher for nonwhites, the total PMC first-birth ratios (the number of legitimate first births per 1,000 total first births) are almost identical for whites and nonwhites. The factor of difference between the racial groups is reduced to two when the total nonmari tally conceived first-birth ratios are compared. The less frequent use of marriage by nonwhites as a means of legitimating an out-of-wedlock pregnancy has been related to a cultural pattern in the Negro community where conception and childbearing outside of marriage are tolerated (Zelnik and Kantner, 1970). Data reported elsewhere suggest that Massachusetts nonwhite mothers often postpone their mariage to the father of the child, or to someone else, until after the birth and that a substantial portion of nonwhite births registered as illegitimate may subsequently be legitimated (Whelan, 19716).
For both white and nonwhite women there was an indirect association of premaritally conceived births and maternal age. For a teenager, pregnancy may be the primary underlying cause of marriage, while for older women there are factors other than the desire to legitimate an out-of-wedlock conception which precipitate marriage. Diminished access to contraceptives and abortion among teenagers may contribute to their higher proportion of first legitimate births premaritally conceived.
The high proportion of PMC births to Massachusetts parents married in a civil as opposed to religious ceremony and the shorter interval between the civil wedding and the birth of a premaritally conceived child are compatible with the results of other research (Pratt, 19656; Christensen, 1960). These differences are related to a number of factors: (a) a marriage precipitated by pregnancy is less likely to be associated with an elaborate church wed-

ding; (b) couples who are married by a Justice of the Peace may be less likely to accept formal religious doctrine and codes that proscribe premarital sexual liaisons; (c) the type of marriage ceremony may reflect differences in socioeconomic status and different attitudes about the temporal relationship of marriage, conception, and birth. The elimination of the previously noted significant difference (Table 6) between white and nonwhite births to women ages 20-24 in the proportion premaritally conceived when racial comparison was limited to couples married in a Catholic ceremony (Table 8) is best explained by (c).
The proportion of PMC births to mothers whose occupation was indicated as "at home" at the time of the wedding was significantly higher than the comparable proportion of births to employed brides (Table 9). It is not possible to know if the bride's status was "at home" because her pregnancy caused her to leave a job or if a bride who has never worked, because of various social and economic factors, is more likely than an employed bride to conceive before marriage. Although no significant differences were evident in the proportion of legitimate PMC first births between white and blue collar brides and grooms, it was noted that blue collar workers have a shorter interval between marriage and the birth of a premaritally conceived child, an observation which suggests that low socioeconomic couples are under less social pressure to marry immediately after the discovery of the conception.
It is difficult to analyze the association of premaritally conceived births and social variables, such as type of wedding ceremony or occupational status of the bride and groom, without considering the relative role of out-of-wedlock births in each subgroup. When white and nonwhite subgroups

26

Whelan

were compared with respect to the proportion of legitimate first births premaritally conceived, there were relatively small differences; yet, the differences manifest between the races in the other component of nonmarital conception, illegitimate births, were striking. It is possible that there would be a substantial difference in the proportion of nonmaritally conceived births by religion, occupation, and other socioeconomic variables if detailed data on illegitimate births were also available.
CONCLUSIONS
The data derived from the current study of nonmaritally conceived first births in Massachusetts have expanded the current knowledge on the subject by (1) allowing a basis for evaluating potential bias introduced into a birth-marriage record linkage study by the occurrence of the two vital events in different locations; (2) providing for one locality recent vital-record-based information on the extent of illegitimacy and premaritally conceived first births, (3) reexamining the previously noted differences in the frequency and timing of PMC first births among sododemographic subgroups and (4) presenting simultaneously data on both components of nonmaritally conceived first births.
The results of the current investigation suggest that vital data linkage methodologies which are limited to one geographic area do not necessarily result in underestimation of the extent of PMC births. Massachusetts parents married outside of the Commonwealth in one of the seven states where record searching was done did not demonstrate a significantly greater proportion of PMC births. It is still possible, however, that other underlying causes of nonlinkage--for example, the possibility that marriage never actually took place or

occurred a great distance away from Massachusetts--do contribute to underestimation of PMC births.
A substantial minority of white first births and the majority of nonwhite first births occurring in Massachusetts to Massachusetts residents in the 1966-68 period were born outside of marriage or conceived before the marriage of their parents. The differential extent of premaritally conceived births by maternal age, race, occupational status of the parents, and type of wedding ceremony confirm the findings of previous investigations.
The potential personal and social implications of shifts in the temporal relationship of marriage, conception, and birth suggest that an ongoing system monitoring changes in the frequency of illegitimacy and premaritally conceived births be encouraged. Massachusetts and other states with the capability for such research should make the attempt to gather data on illegitimacy and the marriage-birth interval on a regular basis. Hand linkage of records is very time consuming and would preclude annual large scale studies of this type. Two alternative means of collecting data on the marriage to first-birth interval should be considered: (1) methodologies of computer linkage, whereby a sample of birth and marriage records could be brought together, either through a mutual identification number or through a Soundex system which would link names of parents on the data processing card of the birth with the names of brides and grooms on the data processing card of the marriage. Once linkage was made, surnames could be dropped from the pooled record to ensure confidentiality; (2) an item on marriage data of the parents could be included on the confidential section of the birth certificate; these dates could be used in conjunction with record linkage techniques.

SUMMARY
The potential social and personal consequences of shifts in frequency of illegitimate and premaritally conceived births and the general dearth of information on these subjects prompted this investigation of the frequency and characteristics of nonmaritally conceived first births to Massachusetts women in the 1966-68 period. Data were gathered through examination of a sample of birth certificates of illegitimate children and through linkage of certificates of birth of a sample of legitimate first children with the marriage records of their parents. The search for marriage records to associate with the Massachusetts first births was conducted in Massachusetts and seven nearby states. Some 83% of white and 68%of nonwhite legitimate first births were linked with the marriage record of their parents.
While the modal pattern of family formation for the white population in Massachusetts is one where first conception and birth follow marriage, there is substantial departure from this traditional sequence and deviations in timing of events within the three temporal patterns of marriage, conception, and birth. For the nonwhite population, the predominant pattern is one where first conception and birth precede or occur outside of marriage.

Higher-than-average illegitimacy ratios were observed for nonwhite women and white women under age 20. When allnonmaritally conceived first births (illegitimate and premaritally conceived) were considered, the racial differences were diminished.
Babies of both races born to women married in a civil ceremony and babies of both races born to mothers who were not employed at the time of their wedding were more likely to be premaritally conceived than were first babies of women married in a religious ceremony and first babies of women who were employed at the time of marriage.
