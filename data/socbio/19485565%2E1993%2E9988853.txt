ABSTRACT: During the past five years, there have been numerous studies of the relationship between handedness and longevity. In this report, I review previous contributions and use methods of survival analysis on a set of 4,448 males to determine the strength of the relationship between handedness and longevity. The results indicate that left-handers have small, yet significant, declines in survival probabilities between the ages of 65 and 85.

A recent study by Halpern and Coren (1991) indicated that righthanded individuals may live on average as much as nine years longer than lefthanders. Subsequent reaction to their work (e.g., Strang, 1991; Rothman, 1991) questioned their conclusions as well as their methodology. The continuing debate signifies that the possible existence and strength of the relationship between handedness and longevity is still far from being well established. The purpose of this report is two-fold: (1) to summarize the contributions made to date, and (2) to employ methods-of-survival analysis in a population of 4,448 males to compare the mortality experiences of left- and right-handers.
PREVIOUS STUDIES
Halpern and Coren (1988) used data on 1,708 baseball players for whom dates of birth and death were available. They limited their study to players listed as using the same hand for

both throwing and batting. They found that the cumulative percentage of right-handers who had survived was about two percentage points higher than the cumulative percentage of lefthanders who survived each age beyond age 33. They suggested three categories of explanation for their results: (1) potentially higher prenatal and perinatal Stressors among left-handers, (2) the possibility that the immune system of left-handers is less effective, and (3) potentially higher accident rates among left-handers.
London (1989) affirmed the Halpern-Coren (1988) conclusions on handedness and longevity, citing evidence that links left-handedness to smoking and alcoholism, as well as breast cancer and a host of disorders such as early-onset Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.
Using data on a larger sample of 3,474 deceased baseball players, Wood (1988) used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to demonstrate that the difference in mortality between left- and righthanders was insignificant and could

have arisen by chance. Anderson (1989) also used data on baseball players to conclude that there is a significant trend over time toward a lessening of any possible advantage that righthanders may have once had. He suggested that because of stresses associated with left-handedness, genetic selection would compensate by evolving a link between left-handedness and increased survival probability. Removal of society-related stresses upon left-handers would then presumably lead to relatively higher survival rates for sinistrals.
Kuhlemeier (1991) used 2,386 individuals in the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to conclude that handedness and longevity were unrelated. Of the individuals in the sample, 346 dextrals and 20 sinistrals were known to have died.
Most recently, Coren and Halpern (1991) and Halpern and Coren (1991) have reported on the results of a survey of the relatives of 987 deceased individuals. They found that the difference between sinistrals and dextrals in mean age at death was nine years (mean age at death was found to be 66 years for sinistrals and 75 years for dextrals). Their results led to the reporting of several other studies that failed to confirm these findings. Wolf et al. (1991) found no relationship between handedness and longevity after examining the handedness and vital status of 2,088 individuals (611 of whom had died) in the Framingham Study cohort. Marks and Williamson (1991) made use of the National Health Examination Follow-up Study. Handedness and vital status data were known for 2,363 individuals. Though the authors do not report the number of deaths, they in-

dicate that it is approximately 50 per cent greater than the 366 deaths reported by Kuhlemeier's analysis of an earlier follow-up. A lowerlevel of mortality was found in sinistrals, though it should also be noted that the mean age of individuals in the study was only 55.
A principal drawback of the majority of these previous studies is that they confine their analysis to those individuals who have died. A proper approach to comparing the survival curves of any two groups requires analysis of not only those individuals who died, but also those who have survived. For example, a conclusion based upon data on deceased individuals that lefthanders have higher mortality rates may in fact be negated if relatively more of the left-handers remain alive. A related criticism of Coren and Halpern's (1991) use of data on deaths is that even with no differences in longevity, it would be expected from an analysis of the deaths in a given period that left-handers would have a lower mean age at death, if the incidence of lefthandedness was increasing over time.
Although some of the more recent analyses have properly included individuals who were still alive in their analyses (namely, those by Kuhlmeier, 1991; Marks and Williamson, 1991; and Wolf et al., 1991), their sample sizes have been relatively small, making it difficult to detect small effects. All three of these studies were each based upon the deaths of no more than 50 left-handers.

of career, date of birth, and date of death for 4,448 baseball players listed in The Sports Encyclopedia:Baseball (Neft and Cohen, 1991). Only those players born before 1920 were selected, since such a high proportion of those born afterward are still alive. Following previous studies, handedness was assigned to those players with batting and throwing hand the same; excluded from the analysis were players whose batting hand was different from their throwing hand.
3,625 players (71.5 per cent) were right-handed, and 823 (18.5 per cent) were left-handed. Among righthanders, 689 (19.0 per cent) were alive through the end of 1988. Among lefthanders, 135 (16.4 per cent) were alive at the end of 1988.»
For each group and each single year of age, I derived an actuarial estimator of the probability of death (ElandtJohnson and Johnson, 1980, p. 154) that accounts for the differing ages at which individuals began their careers, and for observations that are "censored" (those individuals still alive at the beginning of 1989). I then carried out two statistical tests to compare the survival curves of left-handers and right-handers.
1Although dates of death are given through the end of 1990, there is a time lag in the recording of deaths. It is not possible to determine whether no entry in the death column means (a) the player is still alive, or (6) the player is deceased, but because of the difficulty in tracking individual players, the death has not been recorded. However, by going back to an earlier volume of the encyclopedia (1976), I was able to determine via a comparison to the 1991 volume that underregistration of deaths was 7.4 per cent in 1976. Using a two-year lag (i.e., only those deaths through 1974) reduced the errors of underregistration (just 3.5 per cent). Furthermore, there was no relationship between handedness and the likelihood of underregistration.

A nonparametric Mantel-Haenszel test (Elandt-Johnson and Johnson, p. 255) was used to test the null hypothesis of no difference in survival probabilities, versus the alternative hypothesis that there are consistent differences between the age-specific survival probabilities for left-handers and those for right-handers. The statistic has a unit normal distribution under the null hypothesis. The data yielded a test statistic of 1.72, which is exceeded with probability 0.08 in a two-tailed test, and with probability 0.04 in the onetailed test that hypothesizes lower survival probabilities for left-handers.
Gompertz survival distributions were also fit for each group to allow for a parametric test with greater statistical power. Under the null hypothesis of no difference in longevity, the likelihood ratio statistic has a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom, (see, e.g., Elandt-Johnson and Johnson). For the data analyzed, the likelihood ratio statistic was 6.58, which is exceeded under the null hypothesis of no relation between handedness and survival probabilities with probability 0.037.
Both tests therefore support the hypothesis of elevated mortality levels in left-handed individuals. An examination of the estimated age-specific survival probabilities reveals that the differences are especially significant above age 65. The data in Table 1 indicate that although survival rates are similar for ages 25-65, the survival rates of right-handers are noticeably higher than those for left-handers above age 65. The survival probabilities imply that 21 per cent of lefthanders alive at age 65 will be alive at age 85, while the corresponding

percentage for right-handers is 26 per cent. This difference can not be attributed to chance variation.
The observations were also split into two groups--those born before 1900, and those born during the present century--to determine whether there were any trends in the relationship over time. For the group born before 1900, less than 2 per cent of the observations were censored, i.e., were still alive at the end of 1988. The MantelHaenszel statistic was 2.76, indicating significantly lower survival probabili-

ties for left-handers (p < 0.01 for both one- and two-tailed tests). For the group born in the present century, 37.3 per cent of left-handers and 41.5 per cent of right-handers were still alive in 1988. The overall advantage for right-handers born after 1900 is insignificant, since the corresponding Mantel-Haenszel statistic of 0.79 is clearly insignificant.
It is of interest, however, to compare the survival curves for specific age groups. Table 2 shows that significantly decreased survival probabilities among left-handers are present in both preand post-1900 birth cohorts between ages 65 and 84. Comparisons for the other age groups yield insignificant differences, with the exception of a weak relationship favoring higher survival probabilities among left-handers between ages 17 and 44 for those born after 1900. This latter result is consistent with the findings of Marks and Williamson.
Although the mechanisms leading to lower survival probabilities above age 65 among left-handers remain unclear, the results here, based upon a comparative survival analysis, imply that the issue would indeed seem to merit further attention.
