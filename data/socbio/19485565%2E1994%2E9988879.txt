ABSTRACT:The Individual Fertility Rate (IFR), a measure of current fertility status in small and illiterate preindustrial societies, is estimated for five tribal populations from Andhra Pradesh, India. The Andhra tribes exhibit high individual fertility rates ranging between 49.62 ± 1.76 (Konda Dora) and 66.63 ± 3.16 (Manzai Mali) and fall in the high-fertility category. The differences in IFR values between affinal and consanguineous couples are not significant. A direct positive relation between IFR and tribal hierarchy is observed with relatively higher IFR values recorded for socially higher-ranked tribes in an ascending order from lower- to higherranked groups.

The estimation of fertility rates for preindustrial societies like tribes is constrained by many factors, such as their smaller population size, lack of essential data, difficulties in age estimation, etc. Data for demographic analyses among tribes are often collected by ethnographic techniques, such as household interviews and narrations which are not always reliable, and in many cases the information on women's reproductive histories will be incomplete. Births and deaths are not formally recorded and maintained by illiterate tribes, and hence the demographer must make an estimate of age (Howell, 1979) which may not always be accurate. The conventional demographic analysis needs accurate ages of mother and children for computing age-specific fertility, birth rate, sex ratio, etc. Also, complete reproductive data of a woman from menarche to menopause is required for reporting total fertility and mortality rates. Hence, data from couples who are still

in their reproductive years and those who have adopted birth control measures, as well as those who do not remember their ages, can not be included.
Keeping these facts in mind, Hern (1990) suggested a new measure, the Individual Fertility Rate (IFR), which is independent of age and can be used even if the age of mother is uncertain. It reflects the intensity of current fertility. The data from women who have not completed their reproductive cycle can also be included, and the analysis can be applied to data on small populations. The IFR, thus estimated, is suitable to correlate with certain demographic and socio-economic parameters such as marriage type, income, social status, etc.
The present paper reports the intensity of current fertility through Hern's IFR estimates among five Andhra tribal populations namely, Bod Mali, Manzai Mali, Mulia, Dulia, and Konda Dora. These minor tribes are numeri-

cally small with an estimated population size of little less than 2,000 each, except the Konda Dora whose number was 142,374 as per ITDA (1981). A high degree of consanguineous marriages has been reported among these tribes, and hence an attempt is made to check whether there is any significant variation in IFR between consanguineous and affinal couples.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A sample of 657 families belonging to five tribal groups inhabiting Eastern ghats of Visakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh were surveyed for demographic information. The estimation of IFR suggested by Hern (1990) requires simple data regarding the number of parities and reproductive span of a woman. Here, parity is defined as the number of full-term births while reproductive span is defined as the time in years from first birth to the last. Thus, IFR is a simple estimate of the current individual fertility of a woman which is obtained by dividing parity (P) with the reproductive span (RSy) and the fraction multiplied by one hundred (IFR = P/RSy x 100). The IFR is a continuous variable, but it may be made dichotomous by computation of a secondary variable, FERTCAT, which separates those categorized as Low Fertility (IFR = 0 - 4 5 ) from those categorized as High Fertility (IFR = 45 + ). An IFR value of one hundred indicates that a woman is delivering a full-term baby every year during her reproductive span while a value of fifty means one delivery in two years, irrespective of number of conceptions. The variability between affinal and consanguineous couples is

tested by applying the f-test between the mean IFR values.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The range.and mean values of parity and reproductive span among the five tribal populations are listed in Table 1. The maximum number of full-term births reported in the present study of Andhra tribal women is 14, with a mean parity of 4.47 ± 0.13 per woman recorded among the Konda Dora population. The Dulia Women register a lower range of full-term births (2-7) with a mean parity of 3.35 ± 0.12. The tribes that claim higher social status report lower mean parity compared to the lower ranked Konda Dora tribe who have a higher number of children. Relatively higher values of mean parity are registered in tribes than castes (Babu and Naidu, 1989; Mahadevan, 1986). The longest reproductive span, i.e., twenty-four years after marriage with a mean period of 10.1 ± 0.36 years is found among the Konda Dora. The shortest mean reproductive period is 7.53 ±0.43 years, recorded among Manzai Mali women.
The mean values of the individual fertility rate (IFR) for both affinal and consanguineous couples are presented in Table 2. The highest mean IFR value is 66.63 ± 3.16, registered in Manzai Mali women while the lowest value is 49.62 + 1.17, recorded in Konda Dora women. The mean IFR values of the present study populations are higher than FERTCAT (45) which puts them in the high fertility category (Hern, 1990). The differences in mean IFR values between affinal and consanguineous couples are not statistically significant among the five tribes. A

direct relation between mean IFR values and tribal hierarchy is noticed with higher IFR values for socially higherranked tribes. The descending hierarchical order of the present study tribes is Bod Mali followed by Manzai Mali, Mulia, Dulia, and Konda Dora.
When IFR values are compared with conventional fertility measures such as mean number of conceptions, live births, and surviving children per woman (Naidu et al., 1993), it is found that even though Konda Dora women record higher parity, the actual current fertility rate is lower because of their relatively longer reproductive span. Due to the inclusion of data on premenopausal women and artificially sterilized couples, the parity (term

births) alone did not convey the fertility of a woman since she may have had few or many pregnancies over a period of time. Hence, the estimation of IFR gives the current fertility status of the present study populations.
Thus, estimation of IFR is advantageous and can be applied in tribal demography as it is independent of age and reflects current intensity of fertility of women, who are in different stages of their reproductive career. Also, it is used to record the change in fertility from time to time in the process of modernization of tribal societies and to enquire about the effect of various demographic and socioeconomic variables on individual fertility performance.
