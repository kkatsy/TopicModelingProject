ABSTRACT: In a sample of 61,829 families, the probability of having an additional child is higher in those families with all children of the same sex as compared to those families with children of both sexes. In addition, families with only boys were more likely to have an
additional child than families with all girls.

There is disagreement on the influence of family configuration on family size. Several studies report that parents are more likely to have additional children if all of their children are of the same sex than if they have children of both sexes (Fancher, 1956; Gray, 1972; Gray and Morrison, 1974; Loyd and Gray, 1969; Thomas, 1948), whereas others report family sizes to be invariant over various configurations (Ayala and Falk, 1971; Waller, 1976). The lack of agreement may be partially due to the small sample sizes used in these studies.
This paper reports a test of the hypothesis with an adequate sample size. The data are on the families of the 794,598 American high school students who took the National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test in 1965 (Breland, 1973). All of the families with three (n = 45,089) and four (n = 16,740) children were selected for analysis.

RESULTS
The expected number of children for a given family configuration is based on the relative frequencies in Table 1. For example, the probability that a third-born subject will have two elder brothers \%p = 0.2441;two elder sisters, p = 0.2459; and a brother/sister combination, p = 0.51. The various probabili-

ties were multiplied by the total number of third-born children in families with three children to obtain the expected frequencies for each configuration. Analogous procedures were used for the four-child families.
The resulting expected frequencies along with theobserved frequencies are presented in Table 2. Separate analyses for both family sizes yielded similar results, so a combined analysis is reported here. Table 2 reveals that families with children all ofthe same sex produce many more additional children than expected, whereas the reverse is true for families with children of both sexes; *2(2) = 1100.888, p< 0.001. Whereas this value is highly significant, with N = 61,829, the mean squarecontingency coefficient is only 0.0009, indicating that less than 1per cent ofthe variance infamily size is explained by family configuration.
Table 2 also demonstrates that the sex of same-sex antecedent children is related to family size. If the first twoor three children were boys, the parents are

much more likely to have another child than was the case when the first children were girls, A"2(l)= 148.019,p < 0.0001.
The size of the sample makes these results unequivocal for the population involved. The population involved, however, is restricted to the United States and is clearly biased in favor of white middle-class families. Theresults should thus not be generalized to other populations, particularly in developing countries.
