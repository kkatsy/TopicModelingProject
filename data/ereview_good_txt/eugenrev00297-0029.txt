MULTIPLE INTESTINAL TUMOURS:
A FAMILIAL DISEASE

By CUTHBERT DUKES, Mssc., MD., D.P.H.

HE object of this paper is to bring to
the notice of students of eugenics a

rare form of intestinal disease which
may be traced through certain families. In
individuals xtfected ty by this disease the li
membrane of the large intestine (colon and
rectum) becomes covered with innumerable
tumours, varying from a pin’s head to perhaps an inch in diameter. These are formed
by the proliferation of the cells of the intestinal mucous membrane, and are somewhat
similar in their character to warts on the
skin. Because of their shape these tumours
are called polypi, or, from their microscopic
characters, adenomata. The disease is known
to doctors as polyposis intestini or multiple
adenomata, and its interest to students of
eugenics lies in the fact that it is transmitted
as an inherited defect.

Children born of parents suffering from
polyposis intestini exhibit no symptoms of
int disease for the first few years,
during which time the surface of the bowel is

normal in appearance. In the later period of
childhood or early adult life the inner lining
membrane of the large intestine gradually
becomes covered with tiny little swellings.
At first these changes do not give rise to any
symptoms but as the tumours grow in size
they cause intestinal irritation and later
perhaps diarrhea and small hemorrhages.
The true nature of the disease can only be
determined by examination with the sigmoidoscope, an instrument which gives the surgeon a view of the rectum and pelvic colon.
It is surprising to see how widespread the
tumours may be and yet how slight the inconvenience or ill health they cause. Before
long, however, many serious signs make their
appearance because one or more of these
simple tumours may undergo a malignant

For the benefit of those to whom this
subject is entirely new it may be well to
explain that pathologists divide tumours

into two main groups: (1) the simple, benign
or non-malignant, and (2) the malignant
group (which includes cancer and similar
tumours known as sarcomata). The chief
points of distinction are that the nont tumours remain localized to the
place from which they arise and cause injury
only by their local effect. The malignant
tumours, on the other hand, gradually
infiltrate the surrounding tissues and
ments may be carried by the blood- stream
or lymphatic system to distant organs to
become the seeds of secondary growths. To
decide whether a tumour is non-malignant or
malignant, microscopic examination is often
necessary. The appearance and arrangement
of the tumour cells is very different in each

 

group. The non-malignant tumours were
called innocent (and even designated benign)
because of their less serious nature, but
certain varieties show a tendency to change
and assume mali t characters. The
likelihood of this most serious occurrence
depends on the character and situation of
the growth. The adenoma, or non-malignant
tumour of the intestinal epithelium, is very
liable to change to a cancer.

This is the tragedy which threatens families
afflicted with polyposis intestini, and cancer
of the intestine becomes a very common
cause of death. Malignant disease develops
at an earlier age also in such families than
amongst the general population. Intestinal
cancer is usually a disease of the later part of
middle life or of old age, but in the polyposis
intestini families cancer often appears before

the thirtieth year of life and it may commence even in childhood.

It would be out of place in this journal to
go into further details of the diagnosis,
course, and treatment of this disease.*
My object is only to draw the attention of
students of eugenics to a disease which
certainly belongs to the group in which a
hereditary factor can be observed. There are
many details of the mode of inheritance in
which our knowledge is incomplete, but
sufficient has been learnt so far to show that
the defect responsible for this disease may be
transmitted by both males and females, that
both males and females suffer from the
disease, and that the inheritance can be
traced through several generations. Because
of the great frequency with which this defect
leads to cancer a further study of its pathology may throw light on the aetiology of
malignant disease in general, but it must be
pointed out that the remarkable incidence of
cancer in these families does not prove that

cancer itself = inherited. The inherited defect
appears to an in tendency to
epithelial proliferations of the intestinal
mucous membrane. This leads to the growth
of the adenoma, a variety of non-malignant
tumour which is notoriously liable to undergo
malignant change. For this reason it is
sometimes described as a precancerous lesion.
