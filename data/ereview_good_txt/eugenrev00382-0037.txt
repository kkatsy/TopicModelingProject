 B.7.—Wife of B.6. Born about 1807. Was left a widow

years and died in the infirmary.

her mother, her grandparents—a roadmender and wife—looking
after her. Went as kitchen maid to gentleman’s family, and left to
gotothe shop. She is now in the infirmary and has been there
some years.

C. 3.—Illegitimate child of B. 3, brother of C. 2. A

house. In 1881, the man applied for medical relief and
temporary out-relief. He was suffering from a diseased kidney.
From midsummer, 1881, to Christmas they had out-relief and
medical assistance—C. 6 himself being in hospital for dropsy and
phthisis. He left the hospital and seven weeks later returned to
the workhouse. Meanwhile a third child was born, the family
being continuously in receipt of out-relief. In 1882 he returned

years.
C. 8.—Born 1855, brother of C. 11; he was a plasterer, and

five children of school age.

D. g.—lIllegitimate daughter of C. rand C. 2, married D. 16.
Is a teetotaller. Her first child was illegitimate and born in the
workhouse, this making the fourth case of illegitimacy in direct
descent, her mother and grandmother and great-grandmother
having all had illegitimate children. The joining of the D.9
and D. 16 strains seems to have strengthened the degenerate
tendencies, as the two eldest children are now in the industrial
schools and the third is in the infirmary (E. 6, E. 8 and E. 9).

D. 10 and D. 11.—D. 10 was in the workhouse as a child with

to Canada as a cow boy. He worked his way back on a cattle
boat fifteen years later, to see his brother, D. 17, who, however,
was in India. He got employment in the Road Car Co. for six
years as chaff-cutter. Then lost his job and did odd work until
he came into the workhouse, where he still is at frequent intervals.
Had four children, one illegitimate. Two children in industrial
schools now and one in infirmary. Takes children out of
industrial schools ‘‘ because heis fond of them.” Owing to
schools having no powers of detention the head of the school has
complained that “they cannot learn if they are so often taken
out, especially in winter.’’ The most likely explanation being
that D. 16 uses them for begging purposes. D. 16 traces his bad
luck to his steadiness and soft heart, which has led him to help
others when he could ill afford it.

D. 17.—Born 1878. His parents had out-relief and three
children in Poor Law Schools; after parents’ death four children

the workhouse to be treated for syphilis. Was a bricklayer by
trade, but never kept his work: for some time lived by selling
muffins, and other odd jobs. Hemarried D. 25, and the result of
his illness may be traced in the deaths of the first four children.
He lived in the house of C. 41 for seven years, and knew D. 59
well, hence his adoption of her illegitimate child. D. 26 is in the
workhouse now. In 1892 he applied for relief, and the medical
