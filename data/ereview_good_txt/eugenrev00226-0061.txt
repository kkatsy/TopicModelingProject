‘Migration to and from the United

Kingdom

SOME FACTS

HE RECENT PUBLICATION of the Fifth

‘Report of the Oversea Migration Board

(Cmd. 975) provides a suitable opportun
ity to consider the size and character of Britain’s

gains and losses from permanent inward and
outward movements of population.

As shown on page 131 of the July 1959 (51,
2) issue of the REVIEW, at the present time the
effect of migration upon population size is
minimal. It is probable that when the ten years
between the censuses of 1951 and 1961 are
completed there will have been a net loss during
that period of only some 100,000 persons from
this source, thus reducing the excess of births
over deaths from 2,100,000 to 2,000,000 approximately. In fact, it is estimated that the United
Kingdom population increased during 1958—
by perhaps 45,000—as a result of all travel to
and from the area.

Migration statistics are obtained from a
variety of sources, the details of which are too
intricate for mention here. These sources are not
wholly consistent. As a result, it is difficult to
show figures for those who entered and left
comparable to the net estimate of 45,000 quoted
above. The Board’s Fifth Report shows 142,000
as the number of emigrants and 165,000 as the
number of immigrants in 1958, but each of these
totals has a different basis and significance and
is analysed into a different series of sub-groups.
Broadly, however, this country gained perhaps
60,000 persons from Eire and a net 20,000 from
foreign countries; in relation to the Commonwealth it yielded 95,000 to the five main receiving
countries of Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
South Africa and the Central African Federation but received about 40,000 from other net
Commonwealth movement.

Although net gains and losses are not large,
the gross inward and outward movements are
more significant. The characteristics of the

migrants as regards sex, age, occupation, race,
state of health and other factors are therefore of
considerable interest. Some information is given
in the Fifth Report about the first three of these
factors. _

The details of age relate to Commonwealth
citizens travelling in and out by the long sea
routes and intending to change their country of
residence for a period of at least twelve months.
They are derived from 105,000 leavers and
61,000 entrants and thus cover a good proportion of the whole movement during 1958.
The percentages in the principal groups are as
follow:

All All Net

Age emigrants immigrants emigrants

Under 5 10 9 13

35-44 15 14 16
45-54 7 8 6
55 and over 8 10 5
Total 100 100 100

These three series are very similar to one
another and suggest that those who leave and
arrive have at least one characteristic in common. The proportions of women to men are
also fairly similar: 123, 115 and 136 per cent
respectively. Men no longer preponderate in
migration; (one of the reasons for the excess of
women among emigrants is marriage to servicemen of the United States armed forces and
consequent travel to America when the husband’s
tour of duty in Great Britain is completed).

The net movement is not, however, without
an effect on the population as a whole, in which
the ratio of women to men is only 102 per cent
and in which the proportion aged fifty-five and
over is not 5 per cent but 23 per cent.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

The comparative table of occupations is of
even more interest to eugenists. The following
approximate percentages relate to 76,000 persons
who emigrated during 1958 and 47,000 who
immigrated in the same year (all Commonwealth
citizens).

Once again, the figures for emigrants and
immigrants are remarkably similar, although as
the groups are broad ones the status or degree of
skill in the activity does not appear. The Report
gives some figures for specific professions which
show that net losses during 1958 included over
1,000 teachers, 500 doctors, 1,300 nurses and
600 engineers and scientists.
