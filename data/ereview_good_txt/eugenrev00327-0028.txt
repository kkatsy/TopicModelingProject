FURTHER STUDIES IN HEREDITARY
ABILITY.

By W.T. J. Gun, F.R.Hist.S.

In the accompanying charts, all persons, the dates cf whose births and
deaths are given, appear in the Dictionary of National Biography,
or in the case of Americans, in Appleton’ s Encyclopaedia of American
Biography. Some so marked are still living or have deceased since
the last publication of these works, but these will undoubtedly find a
place in future issues.

In a previous article in this Review (April,1924) ,the present writer
set out a number of family connections based chiefly on men eminent in
public life. In this article it is proposed to consider connections based
on men eminent in other avocations. Public affairs, science, literature

.and art may be reckoned the principal categories of human endeavour

in which distinction has been attained. Success in commerce alone
has never, in the opinion at any rate of posterity, been considered as of
equal value, though it is not uninteresting to note in what types of
families such success has been most often achieved.

From a considerable number of charts compiled by the writer, the
conclusion has been reached that public men have sprung from notable
connections to a much greater extent than others. This was to be
expected, as until recent times at all events, the great governing
families in this country have had many extrinsic advantages not
strictly connected with heredity. In the case, however, of science,
literature and art there would not on the other hand appear to be much
difference in the assistance of extrinsic advantage. Nevertheless there
can be no doubt that writers on the whole have had more eminent
relatives than scientists; scientists than artists. The reasons for this
difference are rather obscure, possibly greater heredity of the faculty
for culture is requisite for literary ability.

In any case, however, it will be seen very clearly from the accompanying charts, which are typical of many others, that variety of
ability, rather than specialised ability ,is the distinguishing characteristic of good stocks. In those cases where some particular form of
ability has been carried on, this is probably often due to family
influence of the indirect kind and the individuals in the later generations might often under other circumstances have distinguished themselves in other fields.

In this, as in the previous article, mention has been avoided of the
connections already detailed by Sir Francis Galton in his ‘‘Hereditary
Genius,’’ this excludes such well known families as the Darwins,
Wedgwoods, Wesleys, Sheridans, Gregorys, Taylors of Ongar,
Taylors of Norwich, Macaulays, Stephens, Kembles.
FURTHER STUDIES IN HEREDITARY ABILITY. 99

As also in the previous article, connections-which show distinction
in the male line only are omitted, the intention being to bring together
relationships not so apparent on the surface.

Of the ten charts accompanying this article, which have been
carefully selected out of over one hundred, four deal with English
connections, three with Scotch, two with American and one with
Irish. These are numbered 13—22, the numbering being carried on
from the previous article, where the first 12 charts were shewn.

As will be seen, there are some striking resemblances between
Charts 13 and 14, again between 17 and 18, and again between 20,
21 and 22.

Chart 13. The first of three Scotch connections deals with the
relatives of Sir Walter Scott on his mother’s side. His maternal grandfather, John Rutherford, was a prominent physician in Edinburgh, but.
the connection is really based on John Rutherford’s wife, Jean Swinton. The Swintons are one of those Scotch families who shewed during:
several generations distinct ability, without rising to any great height,
the chief individuals of note occurring in their descendants through
female lines. From one, Sir Alexander Swinton, early in the 17th
century, sprang Alexander, a Scotch judge, and John, who played
some part as a politician in the turbulent times of Cromwell and Charles.
II. He was grandfather of Jean Rutherford, whose maternal ancestry
is however more notable. On this side she descended from William
Alexander, Ear] of Stirling, a man who played a versatile and restless.
part temp. James I., at once a courtier, statesman, poet and coloniserof Nova Scotia. He was an ancestor of Sir Walter in an almost direct
female line. Onthis side too, there is a connection with the Hamiltons,,
bringing in a relationship between Scott and Anthony Hamilton,
author of the Grammont Memoires, and the latter’s sister, the Comtesse de Grammont, immortalised in those Memoires. To be exact,
Anthony Hamilton was second cousin of Scott’s great grandmother.
James Boswell, it may be mentioned, also derives from these Hamil-.
tons, though the relationship is still more distant.

More nearly connected with Sir Walter, and like him descended
from the. Swintons, are an interesting group of artists, George Watson,
the first President of the Scottish Academy and his nephew, Sir John
Watson-Gordon, at one time the leading portrait painter of Scotland,
while George Watson’s maternal grandson, James Grant, followed afar
off in the footsteps of his great relative, Sir Walter.

The Swinton family has kept distinction to the present day, among
others, James, a portrait painter of note and Mr.Alan Swinton, F.R.S.,,
a leading electrical engineer.

The Archbishop of Canterbury and Sir Douglas Hogg, derive in
the female line from this stock, and it is interesting to note that the
latter’s son, Mr. Quinton Hogg, named after his grandfather, the
founder of the Polytechnic, is at present captain of the school at Eton..

Literature, art, science and public affairs are all represented in
the fine Scottish stock, of which the Swinton family forms the central
line.

Scott is undoubtedly the greatest of Scottish men of letters, many
would rank Robert Louis Stevenson as the second. His connections.
1000 EUGENICS REVIEW.

are set out in Chart 14. As in the case of Scott, the long line of note
occurs on the maternal side, though Stevenson’s father and paternal
grandfather and uncles were all engineers of distinction, chiefly concerned with the building of lighthouses. His mother was a Balfour
of Pilrig and this: family are, in some respects, curiously like the
Swintons. They can be traced to one James Balfour, who in the
reign of James I. married Barbara Melville, a lady with most distinguished relatives. Her uncle, Andrew Melville, was second only to
Knox in the Scottish Reformation, while Henry Scrymgeour and the
Youngs were among the greatest scholars of their time. Sir Peter
Young was James the First’s tutor, and whatever else that monarch
lacked, he certainly did not lack learning. °

It might have seemed at first that distinction was to die out in
Barbara Melville’s descendants, though the Balfours, first in the
Church and then. in commerce, were always men of standing. Their
marriages were fortunate and by degrees they emerged from comparative obscurity. Through these marriages Stevenson was related to
Sir Thomas Hope, an eminent lawyer and founder of a great legal con-"
nection to which, among others, Lord Erskine belonged; to Sir
William Hamilton, the most noted metaphysician of his time; and to
the Elliots of Minto, who produced a really remarkable number of
men of note in the direct male line.

Three literary connections may specially be noted: Jean Elliot of
the Mintos, authoress of that pathetic poem ‘‘The Flowers of the
Forest ,’’ composed it is said in the course of a drive in answer to a
challenge by her brother; Thomas Hamilton, author of a novel **Cyril
Thornton’’ once well known, but now forgotten, and G. J. WhyteMelville, whose hunting stories are probably still remembered.

Science appears later in the Balfour family. Thomas Balfour as a
surgeon and George Balfour as a physician won recognition, while
among these varied abilities the name of Leslie Balfour-Melville, a
winner of the amateur golf championship and a very brilliant all round
athlete, should not be omitted.

The close general resemblance between the Scott and Stevenson
connection will not escape observation, and in both cases the varied
ability shown has owed little to wealth or to outstanding social position. |

A third Scottish connection of interest is based on the historian
William Robertson. Chart 15. The founder of the connection was
his grandfather William Robertson, a minister of the Church of
Scotland, one of whose daughters, Jean, married Alexander Henry.
Their son John emigrated to America and was father of the famous
Patrick Henry, who took so prominent a part in the American Revolution, being especially distinguished as an orator. Oratorical gifts,
perhaps also derived from the Presbyterian minister, descended also
to the historian’s great nephew, the Lord Chancellor, Brougham. A
very different type of ability appeared in another branch, that to
which belonged the four brothers Adam, the well known architects,
after whom the Adelphi was named. Robert was the leading
brother, but the family was carried on by John, and continued for
three generations to achieve a certain distinction in various fields,
FURTHER STUDIES IN HEREDITARY ABILITY. 101

military, naval, political, civil service. In the female line,
too, the descendants of John Adam have been well to the fore:
—James Loch as a political economist, Lord Loch as a colonial
governor, and the present Lord Carnock, better known as Sir Arthur
Nicolson, as a diplomatist. :

From the historian directly descended the late Lord Minto,
Viceroy of India and his bro her Arthur, Editor of the EDINBURGH
Review, also Mr. Bertrand Russell whose distinction as a mathematician will probably survive his fame as a Socialist.

The four great names of this connection, Robertson, Brougham
Patrick Henry and Robert Adam would alone be sufficient to give
it distinction, but as has been seen, varied ability, though of lesser
note, has continued for several generations.

From Scotland we turn in Chart 16 to Ireland. Charles Doyle,
the founder of this connection was a country gentleman, in himself
quite unknown to fame; it is interesting to note that his immediate
ancestry was wholly Celtic, his mother was an Egan, and this and
Doyle are thoroughly Celtic names. In many directions this strain
of Celtic blood made itself manifest. In the male line the Doyles were
chiefly famed in arms, from the American Revolution to the Crimean
War. Poetical gifts were evident in Sir Francis Doyle, and in that
most versatie of men, the first Earl of Lytton, descended from the
Doyles in the female line. Lord Lytton of course inherited ability
also on the paternal side, but some of his most marked characteristics
come clearly from his brilliant, though very eccentric, mother.

Charles Doyle’s maternal grandson, Charles Kendal Bushe, was
an Irish Chief Justice, and himself grandfather of a very distinguished
Archbishop of Dublin, who like Lord Lytton, derived marked ability
from both sides. This branch brings in a connection with the
Cramptons, a very well known medical family in Dublin.

The living descendents of Charles Doyle shew a considerable
diversity of talent. These include :—

Present Lord Lytton (Governor of Bengal).

Mr. Neville Lytton (one time tennis champion).

Sir Bertram Windle, F.R.S. (Anthropologist .)

Miss Edith Somerville (novelist, author of ‘“The Adventures of

an Irish R.M.’’)

Benjamin Plunket, Bishop of Meath.

Sir Conyngham Greene (late Ambassador to Japan).

Mr. Plunket Greene (singer.)

With the Doyles, may in some respects, be compared an English
connection, the descendants of John Symonds, a Worcestershire surgeon of the 18th century. Three families are specially prominent, the
Symonds themselves, the Hills and the Mackenzies. The Symonds
family can shew seven members of the medical profession in the direct
male line, but none achieved much note till the elder John Addington
Symonds, whose professional attainments were equalled by his literary
attainments, which latter he passed on with interest, to his brilliant
son. Medicine however is well represented in the Mackenzies by Sir
Morell, the famous throat specialist, but his brother, Charles, struck
out an entirely new linc by going on the stage. This deeply offended
102 EUGENICS REVIEW.

his relatives in whom a Puritan tradition was very strong, and
occasioned his adoption of the pseudonym.-of Henry Compton. Under
this name he made a great reputation in refined comedy, he and
his son both married into families connected with the stage, and the
son and his daughter have continued that calling with distinction. In
addition to Sir Morell Mackenzie, science is also represented in this
branch by the late Mr. Louis Miall, F.R.S.

The most notable of the Hills was Sir Rowland, the famous organiser of the, alas, defunct penny postage; but all his brothers were men
of ability; his niece Miss Rosamond Hill held a high position in the
educational, and his nephew, Dr. Birkbeck Hill, in the literary world.

The living descendants of the Worcestershire surgeon shew a
diversity of talent as striking as that shewn by the living descendants
of the Irish squire. The former include :—

Mrs. Vaughan, miscellaneous writer.

Dame Katharine Furse, head of the V.A.D.’s during the war.

Lord Strachie, ex-Minister.

Mr. St. Leo Strachey, Editor of the ‘‘Spectator.’’

Mr. Compton Mackenzie, novelist.

Miss Fay Compton, actress.

Mr. Matthew Hill, science master at Eton.

Sir Arthur Hill, well-known solicitor.

Dr. Leonard Hill, F.R.S., physiologist.

Sir Maurice Hill, Judge of the High Court.

Sir Leslie Scott, ex-Solicitor-General..

A comparison of the Doyle and Symonds connections shews an equal
diversity of talent, and, on the whole, a distinct resemblance in the
nature of the diversity. Science, fiction, administration, appear in
both, and music in the one case is balanced by the drama in the other.
k "5 Hereditary ability in scholarship has often been noted; the
Kennedys of Shrewsbury and the Butlers of Harrow are perhaps the
best known instances, but in both these cases distinction has, on the
whole, been confined to the male line. Chart 18 traces a line of
descent through several families, shewing a continuation of scholarship, but including also various other activities.

Benjamin Heath, son of a successful merchant in Exeter, was the
first of this connection to come to the fore. He made a name as a
critic and book-collector, his son Benjamin became headmaster of
Harrow, commencing a connection with that school second only to that
of the Butlers. Louisa, daughter of the elder Benjamin married
Joseph Drury, who succeeded his brother-in-law at Harrow, and
brought the school to an unprecedented pitch of prosperity. Two of
his sons, Henry and Benjamin became assistant masters at Harrow,
both were distinguished classical scholars. A third brother, Heber
was a noted botanist. John Merivale, husband of this sister, a leader
of the Chancery Bar, was himself a fine scholar. His sons Herman and
Charles carried on the tradition. Charles, in early life, distinguished,
like Charles Wordsworth (see Chart 20), alike as a scholar and as an
athlete, is best known now as the historian of Rome. Herman, who
was actually head of the school at Harrow before he was 16, became a
singularly able public official. His ‘‘Lectures on Colonisation’’
formed a turning point in the history of relations between the Home
FURTHER STUDIES IN HEREDITARY ABILITY. 103

Government and the present Dominions. During his tenure of the
Permanent Under-secretaryship for the Colonies a beginning was made
of the grant of responsible self-government. His son, Herman Charles,
was well known in his day as a dramatist.

The Mallets, the final family in this chart, have worthily continued
the distinction of the connection. French on the paternal side, they
are descended from Mallet du Pan, the great Royalist journalist during
the French Revolution. The elder Sir Louis Mallet, a noted economist, negotiated the famous Cobolen Treaty with France; his sons Sir
Bernard and Sir Louis are distinguished public servants. _It is interesting to recall that the Mallets have English, French, German and
Swiss blood in their veins. The wife of Benjamin Heath was a Swiss
of the name of Michelet, possibly related to the historian ; the mother
of John Merivale was a German. It is perhaps a moot point whether
this kind of mixed descent does or does not lead to ability, but there is
certainly no doubt in this instance.

Chart 19 shews one of the comparatively rare cases of descent of
specialised ability, no fewer than ten artists of more or less note were
descended from a Mr. Dawnay, a Vicar of Kew in the 18th Century.
It does not appear whether the Vicar himself shewed any artistic
talent, but it may be mentioned that one of his daughters married
John Dillman, who laid out the original Kew Gardens. From the
other daughters sprang the Engleheart and Richmond families. The
former, who were of German origin, confined themselves exclusively to
miniature painting; of these George was the most eminent. In the
Richmond family three successive generations achieved fame in art:
Thomas, like his cousins, painted miniatures, George, the greatest
of the whole connection, was perhaps the most noted portrait painter of
his day, and the succession was completed by the late Sir William
Richmond, R.A. Admiral Herbert Richmond, son of Sir William,
has adopted a different sphere of activity, even in this connection,
though ability remains, the specialised form no longer continues. Nor
has it continued in the Engleheart family, though the late Sir Gardiner
Engleheart worthily filled various public offices. He died a centenarian, and it is curious, considering how rare is this longevity, that
there should, in recent years, have been another instance in a notable
family of the attainment of this age, in the person of Mrs. Haldane,
whose distinguished connections were set out in the previous article.

Chart 20 deals with the descendants of Robert Barclay of Ury,
the famous Apologist of the Quakers. David Barclay, the father of
Robert, served as a soldier under Gustavus Adolphus, and though,
owing to the adoption of the tenets of Quakerism, few of the connection
entered military service, physical strength and athletic prowess have
been nearly as notable among Robert Barclay’s descendants as mental
ability. Robert himself was a man of herculean strength; his great
grandson, Robert Barclay-Allardice was famous in his day for his
pedestrian feats; Charles and Christopher Wordsworth were in youth
‘as noted for athletics as for scholarship, and several members of the
Buxton and Hoare families have distinguished themselves at games.

Of the various families in this connection, the most notable are
the Galtons, Gurneys, Buxtons, Hoares, Wakefields and Wordsworths.

The relationship of Sir Francis Galton to the Darwins on his
104 EUGENICS REVIEW.

mother’s side is the better known, but he came of first-rate stock on
his father’s side as well. He and his cousin Sir Douglas, a well-known
engineer, represent science on this chart; their aunt Mrs. Schimmelpennick was best known for her literary activities. The Gurneys, above
all Samuel, were very successful business men, and almost equally wellknown for their philanthropic activities, particularly of course, the
famous Mrs. Fry. This tradition has been carried on by the Buxtons
and Hoares: a member of each of these families is represented in
present day politics, Mr. Noel Buxton follows in the footsteps of his
ancestors, Sir Samuel Hoare belongs to the opposite party.

The Wakefields are a remarkably interesting family, who played
a leading part in colonial history in the last century. Edward Gibbon
Wakefield was the most prominent member, to him more than to any
other man we owe the genesis of Dominion self-government, his only
rival in this respect being Herman Merivale, who appears on Chart 18.
Wakefield did not, in early life at all events, share the almost austere
morality of most of this connection, but having suffered imprisonment
for the abduction of an heiress, he splendidly retrieved this early
lapse.

Three of the Wordsworths, Charles, Christopher and John, became
bishops, and Miss Elizabeth Wordsworth, who is stillliving, was first
Principal of the first Womens’ College in Oxford. Charles Lloyd, the
uncle of the two elder of these Wordsworths, was himself a poet of
some note, and was grandfather of William Clark Russell the novelist.

The Barclay connection, as a whole, shews many strong general
characteristics, and in particular that combination of religious
principles and business acumen so typical of a certain side of
English life.

It is interesting to compare this connection with the Villiers connection set out in the previous article. Both shewed ability extending
over several generations, but there the resemblance certainly ends.

On the other hand a strong general resemblance exists between the
descendants of Robert Barclay and the descendants of Philip Henry
(not charted). Philip Henry, like Barclay, was a leading Nonconformist in the 17th century. Among his descendants are Samuel Rogers,
the poet, the brothers Samuel and Daniel Sharpe eminent respectively
in Egyptology and geology, Anna Swanwick, the translator of Goethe
and Aeschylus, R. H. Hutton, the essayist, Charles Vaughan, the
famous preacher, Sir Bernard Pares, well known as an authority on
Slavonic literature, and the Greg and Rathbone families who, like the
Gurneys and Buxtons, combined business with philanthropic activities. To this last branch belongs Miss Eleanor Rathbone, the well
known sociologist.

Among American connections none present features of greater
interest than the descendants of Thomas Dudley, Governor of Massachusetts shortly after the foundation of that colony. Many attempts
have been made to connect this Thomas with the great English family
of Dudley, but so far no direct proof of relationship has been forthcoming, and the parentage of Thomas’ father, Roger, remains quite
uncertain. From the eugenic point of view a connection between these
American Dudleys and the family of John, Duke of Northumberland ,.
would be of especial interest having regard to the great distinction

FURTHER STUDIES IN HEREDITARY ABILITY. 105

achieved by the known descendants of the latter. As far as dates are
concerned Roger Dudley might have been an illegitmate son of the
Duke, he was certainly not a legitimate son, but there is nothing
definite in support of this surmise.

Whatever may have been their origin, the descendants of Thomas
Dudley proved an exceptionally able stock. Thomas’ son Joseph,
like his father, Governor of Massachusetts, has been described as a
‘philosopher, scholar, lawyer and divine all combined.’’ In the
male line of the Dudley family distinction tended to die out, but from
the marriage of Joseph’s daughter to Wait Winthrop, grandson of the
great John Winthrop, the real founder of New England, originated a
distinguished line of the name of Winthrop, the greatest of whom was
Robert Charles, who won a considerable reputation in his day as an
orator. There were other notable Winthrop descendants of the first
John who did not share the Dudley blood, particularly the John who
died in 1779, the foremost teacher of science in the American Colonies,
to whose influence was due the interest taken by Benjamin Franklin in
scientific pursuits.

It is however to the descendants of Anne Bradstreet , the daughter of
Thomas Dudley, that the greater part of the distinction of this connection is due. Anne was herself a poetess of some pretentions, but
for several generations at any rate, it hardly seemed as if her descendants would rise above mediocrity. Beginning, however, with the
latter part of the 18th century and culminating in the 19th, a remarkable number of men of eminence arose in this branch, Oliver Wendell
Holmes, Wendell Phillips, and various members of the Channing and
Dana families. Oliver Wendell Holmes was evidently himself a
strong believer in heredity. To a lady who asked him about the
education of her child he is reputed to have said, ‘‘Madam, a child’s
education should have begun at least a hundred years before he is
born.’

Robert Charles Winthrop has been mentioned as an orator; oratorical powers were also strongly developed among the descendants of
Anne Bradstreet, particularly in the case of William Ellery Channing
and of Wendell Philipps. Holmes andthe Dana family were more distinguished as writers, and taking the Dudley connection all through,
ability with tongue or with pen seems to have predominated. Two
of the Channings however distinguished themselves as doctors. Art
does not seem to appear in this connection ; Catherine, daughter of Wait
Winthrop and Anne Dudley married Epes Sargent, as his second wife,
but the many Sargents of distinction since, including the great painter,
are for the most part descended from Epes Sargent by his first wife.

John Singer Sargent had however, through his mother, a descent
from the Pierponts, another notable American connection, Chart 22.
The painter derived from Robert Pierpont, brother of the John who
heads this chart. Like the Dudleys, the Pierponts claimed relationship with a great English family, in this case the Earls of Kingston, to
which Lady Mary Wortley Montagu belonged, and from which
Francis Beaumont, the dramatist, and Lord Chesterfield, the letter
writer, derived through female lines. This relationship is also in the
writer’s opinion at present non-proven, though it is by no means
improbable.
106 EUGENICS REVIEW.

From James Pierpont, son of John, the first settler in America,
three families in particular may be remarked, the Pierponts themselves, the Edwards and the Dwights. The most notable of the
Pierponts were Edwards, minister to Great Britain, and John, divine
and poet, grandfather of the well known millionaire, John Pierpont
Morgan. Ofthe Edwards family, the second Jonathan, who inherited
the Pierpont blood, had a career remarkably similar to that of his
better known father. Both were dismissed from the ministry on
account of their doctrinal opinions, both later became presidents of
colleges and both died shortly after, each having preached on the first
Sabbath of the year from the text ‘‘This year shalt thou die.’’

Among several others of note in the Edwards family, mention may
be made of William, who introduced a new system of tanning leather.

Of the Dwights, the greatest was probably the Timothy who died
1817, a very distinguished President of Yale, of which University his
ancestor James Pierpont had been one of the founders. The Dwights
however, like the Edwards, have shewn very varied ability, as writers,
clergymen, merchants, physicians, lawyers. Theodore Dwight Woolsey
was like his grandfather, President of Yale, his grandson Mr. Theodore
Woolsey has achieved distinction in forestry. He is 7th in descent
from James Pierpont, and every intervening generation has produced at
least one man of note, and in two cases several.

The Pierpont connection has certain obvious resemblances to the
Dudley, but has produced fewer men of international reputation. The
Dudley ability has been on the whole more scholarly, while the Pierpont
has turned more to administration and commerce. Actually the best
known figure in the latter is probably Aaron Burr, Vice-President of
the United States, who unlike most of his relatives, was a man of loose
morals, and ruined his career by killing the famous Alexander Hamilton
in a duel.

A comparison of the last four connections that have been considered ,
the Barclay, Philip Henry, Dudley and Pierpont, brings out certain
features which they have in common. Each derived from a man of
some note in the 17th century; the greatest distinction was not reached
till the 19th, roughly from the 5th to the 7th generation from the
founders. The culminating effects are quite clearly due to the influence of continued intermarriage with other good stocks. The apparent
slowness of development may , however, inthe case of the two English
connections at all events, have been due partly to their Nonconformity, which in the 18th century would have militated greatly against
their advancement.

It might perhaps be argued that among the large number of descen
dants of an individual in the 17th century, some must, on the doc
trine of chances, achieve distinction. Having regard however to the
small number who appear in a biographical dictionary in comparison
with the total population, the number so occurring in the last three
charts is out of all proportion to anything that could have arisen
through mere chance. At least 28 descendants of Robert Barclay
appear in the Dictionary of National Biography. If it were possible
to trace all the descendants of an individual of the 17th century,
picked out at random, it is improbable that more than two or three,
and very likely none at all, would be found in those pages.
