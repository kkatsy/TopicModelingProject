COMMENTS AND CRITICISMS.

The Next Generation.—Apropos of Dr. Moore’s figures (wide
“ Periodical Literature”) for the population of Europe 30 years hence,
“Army Surgeon,” writing in the Sunday Chronicle, draws much the same
deductions, 7.e., that in 1940 there will be too millions in Germany as
against 60 millions in England, and 4o millions or less im France. But
he adds another disquieting suggestion—that Germany has a peasant
population of 20 millions, while ours is mainly urban, and therefore
less physically fit. Moreover, as Germany is the only natiom which has
deliberately encouraged vice, so also she is the only one to make it
tolerably safe for the vicious.

This means that the spread of the venereal diseases will be most
disastrous outside Germany, and it must be remembered that they not
only affect the health of the living, but that gonorrhcea is responsible for
a large and imcreasing proportion of sterility to still further lower the
birth-rate.

There is also the recent rapid rise in the tuberculosis rate and the
generally low level of public health as revealed by recruiting statistics.

Professor Arthur Keith has brought this graphically home by the
following contrasting sets of figures.

Normally, any 1,000 young men collected at random from a populaoo of good health and physique should approximately be divided as
follows :—

“Grade 1 beeen 700
39D tee eens 200
39 3 een eee eee eee 75
393 4 eee eee 25

z.@., 10 per cent. of unfit men should be expected. (Germany had 16 per
cent. before the War.)

But a typical recruiting survey from an industrial town yields the
following disastrous results :—

Grade 1 wee bes wee vee 190
ny «2 wee vee wee wee 270
» 3 wee wee wee wee 410
» 4 130

It is certainly time for a Ministry of Health and a health rate.
