Rapid falls in the Death Rate

FACTS

SOME

N A BRIEF article printed in the July 1963
issue of the REVIEW, attention was drawn to
some sharp falls in fertility in recent years,

such as have occurred in Eastern Europe and in

Japan. It is well known that, since the end of the

Second World War, some equally sudden re
ductions have occurred in mortality, over a larger

number of countries. It seems worth while to
make a note of some of the areas of greatest
change and then examine their fertility characteristics. The necessary data are provided by the

United Nations Demographic Year Book. Here

are some examples:

DEATH RATE PER

THOUSAND

COUNTRY 1945-49 1950-54 1955-59
Reunion 24 18 14
Zanzibar and Pemba 17 12 8
Costa Rica 14 12 10
Martinique 19 13 10
Mexico 18 15 12
West Indies 14 12 10
Bolivia 16 15 9
Venezuela 14 11 10
Brunei 20 16 13
Ceylon 16 12 10
Singapore 12 10 7
Albania 16 14 11
Bulgaria 13 10 9
Hungary 15 11 10
Spain 12 10 9
Fiji 12 10 8

In most of these sixteen areas, fertility has
remained without material alteration during the
same period, and indeed in some cases it has
actually risenâ€”as the following table shows.
There have, however, been appreciable recorded
falls in Bolivia, Bulgaria and Hungary.

That in Bolivia is of particular interest, and it
apparently occurred between 1952 and 1957.
The data are, however, said to be unreliable, and
they are certainly not matched by corresponding
developments in other South American countries,
in some of which fertility has actually risen. So
the figures, unfortunately, cannot be accepted.
The number of countries in which fertility has
fallen, other than those indicated above, is not
large; their populations are small, and the extent
of the improvement is fairly modest:
