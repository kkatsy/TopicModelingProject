Fertility Differentials in England
and Wales

SOME

The figures in Table 1 have been derived from
the 1951 Census Fertility Volume. They show
the differences in age at marriage and in family
size between social classes, areas and ages at
cessation of education.

The social classes are: I Professional and
Managerial, II Intermediate, IJ Skilled, IV
Semi-skilled, V Unskilled, and these refer to
the occupation of the husband. The figures
shown for age at marriage relate to once-married women aged 45-49 at the census and
enumerated with their husbands. The fertility
bases are: A—all married women aged under
50 at the census in respect of all children born;
B—married women aged 45-49 at the census, in
respect of all children born; C—all married
women aged under 50 at the census, in respect
of children born during the twelve months
ending on the census date. All fertility figures
are standardised, for age at marriage at least.
Comment on the implications of the fertility
figures was made on page 70 in the July 1959
issue of the REVIEW.

Table 2 shows that there is little difference in
experience between the various types of area,
which are classified as follows: (a) conurbations; (b) towns with over 100,000 persons; (c)
towns with 50,000-99,999 persons; (d) towns
with less than 50,000 persons; (e) rural areas.
