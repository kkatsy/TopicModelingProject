REPRODUCTION RATES OF FRANCE & SPAIN
A SURVEY OF RECENT LITERATURE
By D. V. GLASS

MONG the population studies pubAte in war-time Europe one* on
reproductivity in France and twot on
reproductivity in Spain are particularly
interesting. The purpose of this note is to
draw attention to some of the main results
of the calculations undertaken by the
authors concerned; it is not offered as a
substitute for the studies themselves.

Fertility in France

Depoid has previously published various
sets of reproduction rates for France. In
his new paper he attempts to cover the whole
of the nineteenth century and to bring the
position up to the eve of the present war,

His calculations really involve three dis- .

continuous series with different orders of
accuracy :

(a) From 1890 onwards the data are
adequate for the customary computation of
female life-tables and for female fertility
values by five-year age groups.

(0) From 185r to 1890 the data are
adequate for life-tables, but age-specific
fertility rates have to be calculated by
substitute methods. Depoid’s substitute
method involves the assumption of certain
trends in the fertility of each five-year age
group, but the error involved is relatively
small.

(c) From 1806 to 1850 the data are highly
inadequate, since not even the age structure

of the population is given. Depoid evolves
gross reproduction rates from the crude
birth-rates, and the margin of error therefore
rises. For mortality data he uses female
deaths in the age group 0 to 29 years inclusive, and the Demonferrand life-tables for
the years 1817-31, in order to estimate the
number of female survivors (in a life-table
population) at 30 years of age. He finds that
this latter figure gives.a very close approximation to the ratio between the gross and
net reproduction rates.*

On these various bases, Depoid computes
gross and net reproduction rates for fiveyear periods from 1806 to 1935. He also
computes annual rates for the whole period
in question, but these are subject to still
further margins of error and scarcely seem
to add to the value of the other calculations.
The results of the five-year computations
are shown in Table 1.

Even allowing for the approximate nature
of the early nineteenth century rates, it is
evident that, at their highest, French reproduction rates were below the level of other
European countries. They never, for example, reached the level of the G.R.R. in
England and Wales in 1870-2—1Le., 2°35;
and for most of the period were substantially
lower than the Swedish rates—in fact, until
the late 1920’s. When mortality is taken

* This is the case because the age of 30 approximates
quite closely (for France) to the mean age of mothers
at childbirth and to the length of a generation. Both
of these quantities vary over time, as the age-fertility
schedule alters, and Depoid tries to make allowance
for this when he calculates annual reproduction rates.
The method is certainly closer to the ratio (N.R.R./
G.R.R.) than that suggested by E. Batson (South
African Journal of Economics, 1937, pp. 487-8),
namely (Tx,—Tx,) /l, (x,—x,), where x, and x,
are the lower and upper age limits of the fertility
schedule. For example, for Australia, 1932-4, the
correct ratio would be o-:g10; Batson’s method would
give 0-899 (as it assumes an even spread of fertility
throughout the child-bearing ages) and JDepoid’s
method o-gII.

into account, the French rates were not, at
their highest, more than a few per cent
above unity. This, again, contrasts markedly
with England and Wales, where at the highest point (in 1880-2) the N.R.R. was about
1°53. The generally flatter curve of reproductive trends, perhaps indicative of more
deeply rooted familial patterns or of the
social and economic forces conditioning
them, may have prevented a sharp decline
after the first world war, comparable with
that found in other European countries.
But it also had less elasticity during the postdepression rebound. Depoid’s estimates show
that in Italy, Sweden, England and Wales
and Germany, the percentage increase in the
net reproduction rates between 1933 and
1939 was significantly greater than for
France.

It is not yet possible to compute reproduction rates for France for years subsequent to

1939. But a recent article by Gasc* gives
other fertility rates of considerable interest
(see Table 2). Column 3 is the most striking.
It is based on an estimate that there are

about 600,000 wives in these age groups
whose husbands are prisoners of war. If this
estimate is correct, the up-swing in fertility
after 1940 is remarkable. But before accepting Gasc’s conclusion, we need to know more
about his basis of estimation. It is therefore
to be hoped that the Statistique Générale de la

- France will soon publish the annual volumes

of population statistics necessary for a more
detailed analysis.

Fertility in Spain ;

Almansa’s study of Spanish reproductivityt is concerned primarily with the
position in 1930-1 of the country as a whole
and of its different regions and provinces.
Gross reproduction rates are computed in
the customary manner, and net rates are
derived by the approximate method suggested by Depoid—namely by using female
survivors at 30 years of age as a mortality
coefficient. Separate survival ratios appear
to have been prepared for each region and
for each province. The results for the regions
and for the country as a whole are given in
Table 3.

The high reproductive level of the country
as a whole and of many of the regions is
immediately apparent. To find comparable
gross reproduction rates in England and
Wales we should have to go back to 1890-2,

at which time the rate for the whole country 
was about 1-77 and that for the County of
Durham (the highest at the time) 2°57.
Even in Catalonia, the most urbanized and
densely peopled region, the rates are relatively high, the average for the region being
pulled down by the low rate—1z-o11—of the
province of Barcelona. The other provinces
in the region—Lerida, Gerona and Tarragona—had G.R.R.s of 1°318, 1-147 and 1-094
respectively. In the most fertile region—the
Meseta—some of the G.R.R.s were over 2:4.
This was so for the provinces of Segovia,
Burgos and Palencia. On the other hand,
the high wastage rate of fertility is amply
shown by the ratios between the gross and
net reproduction rates. The female survival
ratio (i.e., N.R.R./G.R.R., equivalent, for
Almansa’s computations, to the probability
of surviving to the thirtieth birthday) was
not higher than 0-796 for any of the regions ;
it was below 0-750 for 8 of the 11 regions and
for Estremadura it was only, 0-688. The
ratio for Spain as a whole was 0-704. The
probability of surviving to the age of 30 in
England and Wales for 1930-2 was 0-868
(English Life Table No. 10): For New
Zealand in 1931 the probability was 0-925.

Theoretically, therefore, it might appear
that Spain in 1930-1 was a country in which
it would be relatively easy to raise the net
reproduction rate. It was sufficiently behind
the Western European current of decline for
the gross reproduction rate to continue at a
high level for some time, while the introduction of modern methods of social hygiene—

| especially for reducing infant mortality,

which was II3 per 1,000 in 1931-5—would
substantially lower death-rates. Published
official statistics do not make it possible to
ascertain in any detail the trend of vital
rates since 1932. But from the estimated
reproduction rates and other data given in a
study by Jimeno* we can obtain an approximate picture of what has happened under the
impact of the civil war.

Jimeno gives gross and net reproduction
rates for 1922, 1932 and 1937, the rates for
the last year presumably being based upon
an estimated age distribution of women in
the child-bearing groups. Unlike Almansa,
he does not construct his own life-tables ;
instead, he takes Italian life-tables for years
with comparable Spanish and Italian crude
death-rates. This, of course, introduces an
element of error, but for 1932 the difference
between his survival ratio and that given by
Almansa for 1930-1 for Spain as a whole is
under 1°5 per cent. Jimeno’s main results
are given in Table 4.

REPRODUCTION RATES FOR SPAIN, 1922, 1932 AND 1937

N.R.R. wie wis 1°344 1°277 I°030
Ratio (N.R.R./G.R.R.) 0-670 o°714 o-715

The figures show a decline in the gross
reproduction rate of almost 20 per cent
between 1932 and 1937 as compared with
about 11 per cent between 1922 and 1932.
No rates have been calculated for subsequent years. Over the short period, however, a fairly close approximation can be
reached from the general fertility rates—
that is, the number of live births per 1,000
women aged 15-49 years. This rate is given
by Jimeno as 85:30 for 1937, 75°44 for 1938,
62:11 for 1939, 91°93 for 1940, and 73-64 for
1941.t The gross reproduction rate would
thus appear to be about 1°25 in 1941 and
even the peak year of 1940 would still be
well below the 1932 level. Uxless, therefore,
mortality had fallen markedly—and_ this

+ Jimeno’s estimated rate (all figures for 1938 and
subsequent years are provisional) for 1941 agrees very
well with Almansa’s estimate, which is 74.
64 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

seems very unlikely, as far as can be judged
from the crude death-rates*—the net reproduction rates for 1937, 1938, 1939 and 1941
would be below unity, the figure for 1941 not
being more than 0-9. Jimeno himself finds a
similar result by using the Burgdorfer index.
Confirmation of the precise order of the fall of
reproductivity must await publication of the
age and sex data of the 1940 census. But it
is probable that the decline of fertility in
Spain in the period 1931-41 was greater than

* According to the League of Nations Monthly
Bulletin of Statistics, October 1944, the crude death
rate for 1931-5 was 16°4. The rates for 1940 and 1941

in most other European countries. In 1931,
Spain was one of the few European countries in the “high zone,” in terms of net
reproductivity. In 1941 she had fallen almost
to the level of the United Kingdom. Since
then, the crude birth-rates have risen again.*
It will be interesting to see whether the
reproductive balance can be restored or
whether, after a temporary rise, the rates
will once more continue downwards.

* The crude birth-rate rose from I9°6 in 1941 to
20:3 in 1942. The rate based on the first seven months
of 1943 is 23-2. At the same time the crude death-rate
has gone down since 1941. It was 14-8 in 1942 and the
rate based on the first seven months of 1943 is 13°4.
