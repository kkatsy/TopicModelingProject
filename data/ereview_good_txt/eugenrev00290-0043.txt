THE GENETICS OF INTELLECT*
By C. C. HURST, scD., PhD. ELS.

IXTY-FOUR years have passed since

Sir Francis Galton first demonstrated

statistically the inheritance of natural
mental ability in his classic work on hereditary genius. His conclusions have since been
confirmed and developed statistically by
Professor Karl Pearson, Dr. Adams Woods
and others. Thirty-three years have passed
since Mendel’s laws of heredity were rediscovered, but it was only last year that an
attempt was made to express the genetics of
intellect in terms of a Mendelian formula.
This advance was made possible by the
remarkable progress made by genetics and
experimental psychology during the last
decade.

MATERIAL OF THE INVESTIGATION

Two distinct sets of material have been
used in the investigation. The first is a series
of studies of the natural mental ability of the
parents and offspring of 194 Leicestershire
families continued through many years.
This involved the personal investigation and
grading of the general intelligence of 388
parents and their 812 offspring. The same
families were studied previously by the
author in an investigation of the inheritance
of eye-colour and other physical characters,
and also for the inheritance of musical
ability.

The studies were carried out mainly on
adults, but a few school children are included
in the records. The material includes
representative families of various classes and
conditions of life in a rural manufacturing
and agricultural district in the south-western
part of the county.

Since all the local occupations are represented in the material it provides in this
respect a sample of the general population of the district. In other respects,
however, it can hardly be said to represent

the average population since in choosing
families for investigation, large ‘families of
faithful matrons were preferred and every
endeavour was made to include families
which contained the highest and lowest
grades of intelligence in the district. The
Leicestershire material is distinguished as
the ‘ L.F. data.” (Table I.)

The second set of material used in the
investigation is the data presented independently by Dr. Adams Woods in 1906 in his
intellect gradings of the royal families of
Europe. This material—distinguished as the
“RF, data” (Table I)—was used for
several cogent reasons. Being restricted to
royal families it represents a highly selected
population, with a percentage of high grades
or an intellige.ice index of 32-6, as compared
with the calculated average 9-4 and the
16-5 of the L.F. data. In this respect
Woods’s material is genetically unique and
to get similar data we should probably have
to go back to the times of classical Greece,
in which the necessary genetical evidence is
difficult to obtain.

In many respects Woods’s material is
distinct and widely different from my
Leicestershire material. The L.F. data
represents a relatively constant and narrow
range of intelligence with 72-6 per cent. of
mediocrity, 16-5 per cent. of high grades,
and 10°8 per cent. of low grades. On the
other hand the R.F. data represents an
inconstant and extremely wide range of
intelligence, with only 48-0 per cent. of
mediocrity, but with 32-6 per cent. of high
grades and 19-3 per cent. of low grades.
Further the R.F. data includes the two highest
grades of intelligence, 9 and 10, which are
altogether absent from the L.F. data,
including 3-9 per cent. of eminent persons
and 1-4 per cent. of illustrious genius. Again,
the L.F. data are associated with a variable
social environment, i.e. with extremes of
poverty and wealth; while the R.F. data
34

are associated with the more uniform social
environment of royalty. Finally the L.F.
material is typically English and modern,
while the R.F. material includes families in
Germany, France, The Netherlands, Spain,
Portugal, Austria, Italy, Russia, Denmark,
and Sweden, and the period of time covered
by the data extends from the eleventh to the
nineteenth centuries.

In the R.F. material, intellect is graded
independently by Woods on different lines
from my own gradings of the L.F. material,
although a similar range and scale of grades
is used in both investigations and both are
based on the intellectual achievements of the
individual. Woods’s data were presented in
support of Galton’s statistical law of heredity
and at that early date Woods specifically
declined to apply Mendel’s principles to his
data, on the ground that he was unable to
detect the existence of dominant and recessive types of psychic traits.

The addition of his R.F. data to the L.F.
data increases the range of observations in
grades, space, and time; and, since it involves
the grading for intellect of 212 families including 424 parents and their 558 offspring, it
brings the total material available for study
to 406 families, including 812 parents and
their 1,370 offspring, making a total of 2,182.

DEFINITION OF INTELLECT

Throughout the investigation the concept
“intellect ’’ is taken to represent natural or
native mental ability as objectively expressed in general intellectual activities and
achievements, on the general lines laid down
by Galton and Woods and the more specialized lines laid down by Professor Spearman.
The concept “ intellect ’’ thus broadly corresponds with Galton’s “ natural ability,’’ with
Woods’s “ intellect,’”’ and with Spearman’s
““g.’ Spearman’s discovery in 1904 that
there is a common element in all our cognitive abilities, so that every intellectual
activity involves a general factor ‘“‘g”’ anda
specific factor ‘‘s,’’ has served to clarify and
simplify the complex problem of intelligence.
This two-factor theory of intellect is based
on experimental measurements of intellect
by means of selected mental tests, and mathe

matical reasoning based on tetrad differences
between coefficients of correlation. After
nearly thirty years’ discussion and criticism
Spearman’s two-factor theory is now generally accepted as established, and this
remarkable psychological discovery confirms.
the early assumptions of Galton and Woods
and clears the way for a genetical investigation of the two psychological factors. In
the present investigation it is clear that we
are dealing only with Spearman’s “g”’ and
its variable effects on numerous specific
factors.

THE METHODS ADOPTED

The statistical data of Galton and Woods
and the experimental results of juvehile
mental tests show that intellect in individuals
grades apparently continuously from high to
low in both general and selected populations.
In order to distinguish and define differ ent
degrees of intellect it is necessary to divide
and classify them into grades of equal value.
Woods uses a scale of ten grades and, since
his data are used as they stand, his grades of
intellect have been adopted for the L.F.
material. On this basis there are ten grades
of intellect from the lowest grade 1 to the
highest grade 10. For reasons noted later,
an eleventh grade o, representing total lack
of intellect, or idiocy, has been added to the
grades of Woods. Thus the middle grade 5
represents average or mediocre intellect
while grades o to 4 are low grades, and 6 to
to high grades.

The characterization of these grades is
only of secondary importance, since the
grades are of equal value and the number of
the grade automatically indicates its posi tion
in the measuring scale of values. For pop ular
convenience it may, however, be useful to
add a distinctive adjective to each grade
number, but it should be understood that
these can only be regarded as verbal appr oximations to the numerical scale of grades
(Table 1). ;

From the scientific point of view a more
satisfactory method is the applicatiom of
equivalent intelligence quotient values to the
eleven grades. This equivalence was obtalined
in the following way :

1. by taking the middle grade 5 as
equivalent to an average I.Q. of Ioo,
in accordance with convention; and

2. by taking the generally accepted 70
I.Q. as the borderline between normality and subnormality.

Given these, the table of equivalents
follows logically for the eleven grades, each
grade having a range of 20 I.Q. In the L.F.
data a few of the lower grades of adults
and the school-children were tested for I.Q.
by the Stanford-Binet and Healy pictorial
completion tests, and afterwards assigned to
the adult gradings on the basis of 20 I.Q.
to each grade.

The adult gradings of the mediocre and

16°5
32-6
9°4

higher grades were made on the objective
basis of the individual’s actual mental output and achievements. In each case these
were ascertained by means of an intimate
personal knowledge of the general mental
activities of the persons concerned through
many years of constant observation and
research. The general reliability of the
ratings was checked and established by the
following controls and criteria: (a) repeated
ratings over a number of years, (b) independent ratings by others, (c) conformity of
ratings with occupations according to the
Barr scale, the Taussig scale and the
American Army scale, and (d) genetical tests
demonstrating the Mendelian inheritance of
the ratings.
36

In the R.F. data a similar scale of grades
was used as in the L.F. data, but, the material
being purely historical and beyond personal
observation, different grading methods were
naturally adopted. For this purpose Woods
developed an entirely new method now known
as the histriometrical method. According to
this method the various adjectives used by
biographers, historians, and encyclopedists,
concerning any individual, were sorted out
and averaged, or moded, to give a definite
grading. After various tests against other
and more mechanical methods, Woods found
that the adjective test proved to be the most

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

reliable and delicate test of grading the
intellect of historical persons.

In the present state of knowledge it is
inevitable that all attempts to grade intellect
are imperfect and the results at best can only |
be approximate. In a few cases it is highly
probable that the gradings are erroneous
through pathological complications, especially in the R.F. data where the higher and
lower grades are in several cases closely
associated with epilepsy and insanity. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the fact that,
as we Shall see, these gradings of intellect
show a Mendelian inheritance both in the

Recessive Gene n(nn) for HLG.
HLG (Intellect Grades o to 4 and 6 to Io) are all nn.

Presence of MGs5s in HLG selfed and excess of dominants in MG5 selfed and MG5 back-crossed HLG, indicate
three genetical types of MG5, viz. two dominants NN and Nn and one recessive nn.
The three types of MGs are not certainly distinguishable as phenotypes but are certainly distinct genotypes.
THE GENETICS

-L.F. and the R.F. data, is a sufficient indication of their general reliability. On the whole,
so far as performance can be regarded as a
test or measure of capacity, these gradings
are probably as reliable as any that have been
devised for adults. It is to be hoped that
further experimental research by psychologists will provide us with more refined and
accurate gradings.

ANALYSIS OF DATA

The complete data for each family in both
the L.F. and R.F. series have been published
in the Proceedings of the Royal Society,* where
the grade of intellect of each individual is
set out. Space will allow only a brief summary here.

The 406 families graded produced 1,370
offspring of which 858, or 62-6 per cent.,
were of mediocre grade 5, the other ten
grades taken together amounting to 512, or
37°3 per cent., of the total number of
offspring. This large preponderance of
mediocre grade 5 offspring is paralleled by
a corresponding large preponderance of
mediocre grade 5 parents, 334 of the 406
families having a mediocre grade 5 parent.
Table II shows these families are genetically
of two distinct kinds; 124, or about onethird of them, produce 397 offspring, all of
which are mediocre grade 5, while 210, about
two-thirds of them, produce offspring of
various grades, only about one-half of which
are mediocre grade 5. Out of 719 offspring
of these segregating families 362, or 50°3
per cent., are mediocre grade 5, the remaining 357, or 49°6 per cent., being either low
grades o to 4, or high grades 6 to 10. The
same results are observed in all matings of
the mediocre grade 5 parents, whether
MG5 x MGs, or MG5 x HLG. Thus out of
162 families of MG5 x MGs, 85, or about
one-half of the families produce 294 offspring, all of which are MG5, while the
remaining 77 families produce about one-half
MGs5 and one-half HLG offspring. In the
same way, out of 172 families of the mating
MGs x HLG, 39, or about one-quarter of
the families produce all MG5 offspring, while

* 1932 B, vol. 112, pp. 80-97.

OF INTELLECT 37
133 families produce about one-half MG5 and
one-half HLG offspring. These results indicate clearly that the MG5 parents are of at
least two distinct genotypes DD and DR,
and that MGs is dominant to HLG which is
recessive, RR.

A complication arises, however, in the fact
that the recessive matings HLG x HLG
produce a small proportion of MG5. Thus
the 72 families of HLG x HLG give 254
offspring of which 66, or 25-9 per cent. are
certainly MG5. In view of the presence of
these MGs5 in the recessive HLG selfed, and
also in the excess of dominants in MG5
selfed and back-crossed, we are bound to
conclude that there are three genetical types
of MG5, two dominants DD and DR and
one recessive RR. These three types of
MG5 are not as yet distinguishable as
phenotypes with certainty, although after
considerable personal experience and study
of the three genetical types of MG5 I believe
that they could be distinguished phenotypically by delicate psychological tests.
However that may be, genetical tests show
that there are three distinct genotypes of
MG5.

In these families genetical tests have been
made on the basis of a pair of genes Nn, where
NN represents the DD type of MG5, Nn the
DR type of MG5, and nn the RR type of
MG5. This last RR type of MG5, with the
HLG types grades o to 4 and 6 to 10, form
a complete series of recessive grades of
intellect, o to 10 associated with nn. In this
case the Mendelian difference is not between
grades of intellect but rather between the
typical stable intellect of mediocrity and the
atypical variable intellect of various grades.

On this basis all the high and low grades
o to 4 and 6 to 10 are nn, which provides a
means of testing out the genic constitutions
NN, Nn, and nn of MGs parents. So far, out
of the 406 families graded for intellect, 293
families have been tested genetically.

Table III gives a list of the genic constitutions of the 586 parents tested in the L.F.
and R.F. families. It will be observed that
84 nn MG5 parents have been found, and
that there are 61 NN parents in L.F.
families and only 3 in the R.F. families.

The 226 parents remain undetermined,
owing partly to their small families and
partly to the absence of information about
their parents. It may be noted that while
the presence of a recessive in a family has
been taken as evidence of the heterozygosity
of the parents, in no case has an approximation toa3 : Iorr : Iratioina family been
taken as evidence of the parental constitution
even in the largest families.

The results of the genetical tests are shown
in Table IV, but before discussing these a
brief reference may be made to the data on
differential fertility at the foot of Table ITI.
The figures indicate a definite reduction in

family size from NN to nn parents. Thus,
where an NN parent is concerned the
average family size is 5-2, with an Nn
parent it is 4-7, while with both parents nn
the average family size is 3-2. This association of N with fertility and n with sterility
may represent the multiple effect of a pair of |
genes, thus linking up mediocrity with fertility
and variability with sterility. Since both the
high grades and the low grades of intellect
are nn, and the typical MG5 carry N, one
would expect to find both the High and Low
grades with smaller families than the typical
Mediocre grades. Table III shows that this is
the case. Thus typical mediocre parents have

grades breeding true (cf. Table VIII), but
there is a remarkable and consistent advance
of parents and offspring from low to high
grades with considerable overlapping of
grades. As the parental grades increase the
grades of the offspring increase correspondingly. Inthe two lowest grade matings there
are no high grade offspring and in the two
highest matings there are no low grade
offspring. The normal frequency curve is
approached only in the mediocre matings and
in the totalresults ; elsewhere there is extreme
divergence. This divergence from normal
frequency in the offspring consistently corresponds with the parental grades and we are
forced to the conclusion that heredity is the
cause of the disturbance. Confirmation of
this is found in Table VI where larger
numbers are available in the form of data of
mixed low, mediocre, and high matings of
recessive parents (nn xX nn).

Here we see the same principles at work as

we saw in the more simple selfings, but with
mixed grades and larger numbers and naturally more overlapping. The parental matings
are arranged in regular progression from low
to high and, with a few minor exceptions,
the offspring follow the same progression
from low to high. Underneath the grades of
offspring, the parental grades and the numbers of these used, are inserted in brackets.
This provides a striking illustration of the
influence of the parental grades on the
offspring produced, and emphasises the independent and equal hereditary value of
each grade. Tables V and VI together show
(a) that the grades are inherited separately
and equally ; and (d) that the higher grades
are the result of dominant accumulations of
increaser factors which are less in number in
the lower grades.

It is important to note that the data
shown in Tables V and VI are all the results
of recessive nn xX nn matings, and that the

whole data shown in Table I give a different
end result owing to the action of the dominant NN and Nn genes, which obscure the
normal segregations of the high, mediocre,
and low grades found in the recessives nn.
_It is now possible to construct a genetical
formula for intellect on the lines given above.
On this scheme 729 genotypes are concerned in the genetics of the eleven grades
of intellect: but since the minor modifiers
only act on the recessive nn genes (the N
gene acting as a suppressor or inhibitor of
the modifiers) this reduces the number of
functional genotypes to 243. These produce
seven kinds of effective gametes, i.e. one
gamete for each class of the cumulative
increasers n (I to 5), one for the n(o) class
in which the dominant increasers are absent,
and one for the N class of gamete in which
the action of the modifiers is inhibited or
suppressed. Table VII shows examples of

the formula of each grade with genotypes
and gametes produced. Table VIII gives a
prediction table of the results expected in
selfing the grades.

From this table of selfings the results
expected from the intermating of any of the
grades can be calculated.

It will be observed that two of the grades—
o and 10—always breed true, but since grade
o is hardly capable of breeding and grade Io
is so rare that no selfings are on record, it is
difficult to test this. Of the other grades,
I, 3, 7, and 9 are permanently heterozygous
and can never breed true, while on the other
hand grades 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 may be homozygous and can breed true. In the L. F. families,
14 true-breeding genotypes of grades 4 and 5
have been found. It will be noted that 5
out of the 15 genotypes of grades 2 and
8 breed true and 10 of the 45 genotypes of
grades 4 and 6 breed true. None of the nn

GENETICAL FORMULA FOR INTELLECT
[Nn+ (Aa+Bb+Cc+Dd-+Ee)]} with 729 genotypes.

N and n are a major pair of genes for Typical and Atypical Intellect.
Dominant N (NN or Nn) determines Typical Mediocre Intellect of Grade 5.
Recessive nn determines Atypical Intellect of various grades o to ro.

Aa to Ee are minor pairs of modifying genes which produce grades 0 to Io.
Dominant Modifiers A to E act as equal and cumulative increasers of grades.

Recessive modifiers a to e act as decreasers.
With nn the modifiers are fully active.
With NN the modifiers are totally inactive.

With Nn the modifiers are inactive or only partially active.
Thus the 729 genotypes produce seven kinds of effective gametes.

genotypes of grade 5 can breed true and the
addition of the dominant gene N is necessary
for grade 5 to breed true. Other genotypes
are heterozygous with variable ranges of
scatter. In grades 1, 3, 5, 7 and g one of the
genotypes is limited in scatter to the adjacent
grades on either side; in 1 and g all are so
limited ; the same is true of 20 out of 30
genotypes in 3 and 7 and of 30 out of 51 of
the nn genotypes in grade 5. This class of
genotype is very common in the L.F. data
and almost absent in the R.F. data. It is
interesting to note that only 1 genotype out
of 51 of nn grade 5 throws the extreme high
and low grades and the possibility of a genius
arising from mediocrity (grade 5 parents)
though possible is extremely remote. (Recent
research reveals that both Shakespeare (grade
10) and Emily Bronté (grade 9) had grade 6
fathers and not grade 5 as often assumed.)
Mixed matings are naturally more variable
than selfings, but all can be calculated from
the Prediction Table. An interesting feature
of the mixed matings is the frequent occur
rence of two modes, indicating an independent inheritance of the two grades.

Comparing the Prediction Table with the
L.F. and R.F. data: 6 of the possible 11
grade-selfings occur in 26 families with 115
offspring (Table V). In these the grade
ranges follow the Prediction Table, with no
exceptions. The grade modes and averages
are close to expectation but the numbers are
insufficient, and more material and research
is necessary to test the formula quantitatively.

Qualitatively, in the grade ranges, there is
almost complete agreement between the
Prediction Table and the L.F. and R.F.
data. In the L.F. material of 194 families and
812 offspring only a single exception has been
found. This is a case in which a grade 2
offspring appears instead of the grade 3
expected. Medical evidence in this case
suggests the probability that this exception
is pathological.

Of the 16 genotypes expected in the 6
selfings, 10 have been found in the L.F. and

CORRESPONDENCE WITH L.F. AND R.F. DATA

Note: 6 of the possible 11 grade selfings occur in 26 families. There are no exceptions in 115 offspring grade
ranges. Grade modes and averages are close to expected, but numbers are insufficient. Of the 16 genotypes
expected in the 6 selfings 10 have been found, 5 of which are definitely established by large numbers.

In the mixed grade matings the grade ranges, modes, and averages are close to expectation. In 194 families with
812 offspring (L.F. data) there was only one exception to the grade ranges expected, where a grade 2 appeared
instead of a grade 3. In the R.F. data there were 30 range exceptions in 212 families with 558 offspring or 5-3

cent.

Total percentage of exceptions in 406 families with 1,370 offspring, 2-1.

R.F. data, 5 of which are definitely established by large numbers.

In the R.F. data the exceptions to the
grade ranges are more frequent, there being
27 exceptions in the tested families and 3 in
the undetermined families, making 30 in all
out of a total of 212 families and 558 offspring, or 5:3 per cent. Since 20 of these
exceptions occur in 7 families and 12 of
these in 3 families, it seems highly probable
that the exceptions are due to errors in

grading. Woods’s gradings have been taken
as they stand, and no attempts have been
made to amend them critically. In several
cases the gradings are dubious through
printer’s errors, and there seems to be some
doubt whether the insane persons graded by
Woods can be correctly graded. The 5°3
per cent. exceptions in the R.F. data are
therefore hardly significant, except in so far
as they may be taken as a measure of the
errors in grading.
44 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

If the whole of the L.F. and R.F. data of
406 families and 1,370 offspring are taken,
the percentage of exceptions in the grade
ranges works out at 2:1, which leaves a
small margin of error for dubious gradings.
With the aid of the Prediction Table (VIII)
it is possible to forecast with considerable
precision the grades of offspring that will be
produced by parents of any grades of
intellect. In individual cases the higher or
the lower the parental grade the easier the
prediction, since the grade range expected
becomes more limited. The expected grade
ranges of the offspring of mediocre parents
are too wide to be of much practical value
and eugenic efforts should be concentrated
on the higher and lower grades, which after
all determine the status of a population and
a nation.

From the evidence of the L.F. and
R.F. data it is clear that popular theories
of the origin of grades of intellect by
education, free will, family environment, or
simple heredity, cannot consistently explain
the coexistence of dominance and segregation. These facts involve a genetical basis
and establish the position that the various
grades of intellect are organised and
developed by definite material complexes of
molecular genes. These genes are natural
and native to each individual and are
located in the visible chromosomes of the
cells, one-half of them being derivgd from
the mother and one-half from the father
parent in the natural course of sexual reproduction. |

It is also evident from the L.F. and R.F.
data that the influence of the environment
in the determination of the various grades of
intellect is so small as to be practically
negligible, being limited to a range of onehalf of a grade, ie. ro I.Q., since in about
98 per cent. of cases the genetical grade of an
individual is neither increased nor decreased
by the action of the environment. Intelligence tests show that the genetical grade of
intellect of an individual can be measured
at a tender age and normally remains constant from puberty to senility.

In view of these facts and the data presented it is concluded that grades of intellect

have a definite genetical basis, and that on
the principle of Occam’s Razor there is no
necessity to invoke other causes to account
for these differences.

In presenting this first genetical formula
for intellect as a provisional working hypothesis, no claim is made that it is in any sense
final. The evidence for the major pair of
genes Nn is in my opinion conclusive, and
the minor modifiers follow as a natural
corollary. To me the only open question is
that of the precise number of modifiers
concerned, and that can only be determined
by extended research. At present all one
can say is that five pairs of modifiers and
eleven gradings satisfactorily explain the
data available at the present time.

In conclusion may I draw attention to two
urgent needs in this line of research: (1) An
extension of the present L.F. and R.F. data
to at least 10,000 cases in order that the
formula may be tested quantitatively on a
larger scale. Special efforts should be made
to secure more data of grade selfings. (2)
More refined and accurate methods of
grading intellect in adults, based on general
achievements rather than on specific tests,
and uniformly applicable to all as a common
measure of Spearman’s “ g.”’

PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF
GENETICAL FORMULA

Recent statistics show that in England,
France, Holland, U.S.A. and other advanced
countries, owing to the rapidly decreasing
birth-rate of the more intelligent families,
the intelligence index of the population, i.e.
the percentage of the five high grades of
intelligence, is declining so rapidly as to
endanger the safety of modern civilisation.
In order to keep pace with the recent
advances of science and the rapid mechanization of human affairs, it is necessary that
the intelligence index of the general population should increase and not decline.

According to the genetical formula only
about Io per cent. of the five higher grades
of intelligence may be expected to occur in
a general population and it is obvious that
modern civilization cannot be carried on
without this minimum. The margin of
THE GENETICS OF INTELLECT 45

safety is therefore small and any decline
below an index of Io in a population will
inevitably lead to rapid decay in geometrical progression, resulting in the ultimate collapse of civilization in that country.
In these critical times by far the most
important and pressing problem for the
statesmen of all civilized countries is the
maintenance of a minimum index of Io in
the general population.

Statistics show that the ordinary policy of
latssez-fatve will not solve this problem and
immediate State action on biological lines is
therefore necessary.

It is suggested that a scheme of family
bounties* based on the above genetical
formula would solve the problem rapidly and
effectively. Under such a scheme parents of

* Dr. Hurst’s scheme of family bounties differs in
important respects from the scheme of family allowances supported by the Eugenics Society.

the five higher grades of intelligence, belonging to all classes and conditions of society,
would, with due safeguards and under
medical supervision, receive educational and
maintenance grants for their high grade
children.

Such a scheme of practical and positive
eugenics would immediately encourage the
production of high grade offspring, and in the
course of a generation the intelligence index
of the general population would be increased
and brought up to the minimum safety line
and higher, if considered necessary.

The scheme need not entail any further
demands on public funds, since the relatively
small amount required to finance it could be
found by transferring a small proportion of
the large grants now expended on individuals
of low and mediocre grades of intellect, the
disbursement of which is of doubtful advantage either to the individuals themselves or
to the State. »
