THE EFFECT OF THE WAR ON THE BIRTH RATE 9

a little money, but hardly enough to justify ©

the administrative complications that would
be involved. The cost moreover must not
be counted without due regard to the credit
side. “ If,’’ as one commentator has pointed
out, “the food, the clothing, the cots, the

nursery accommodation represented by this
or that sum are socially desirable—and who
doubts that they are ?—the millions given
to the families is simply facilitating the distribution of the socially desirable goods to
the people socially most eligible for them.”’

 

THE EFFECT OF THE WAR ON THE
| BIRTH RATE
By RICHARD M. TITMUSS

HERE have been signs lately of a

| general awakening to the problems of

a declining birth rate, and in particular

to these problemsas they have been influenced

by the war. These subjects, which for long

must have seemed the private concern of the

Eugenics Society, have been discussed in the

past months in the editorial and correspond
ence columns of the press with a sense of

urgency that must be welcomed as a sign of
the times.

One of the chief contributions to this discussion has been made in a letter to the
British Medical Journal* by Dr. Percy
Stocks. In this he attempts to counteract
pessimistic views about the future of our
population by some reassuring statements
about the present. He concludes that.“ taking all known factors up to the present into
consideration, a large fall in our total population is not inevitable unless our future war
losses are catastrophic or the war is greatly
prolonged, and by wise encouragement, in
which the medical profession can play an
important part, aided by legislative action
it may yet be averted.”” Dr. Stocks does not
essay an analysis of the effects of the war,
nor does he offer any new statistics beyond
stating that “the adjusted reproduction
rate, which allows for a continuing improve
* 1942, 1, 394.

ment in the death rates of women, was 0°84
in 1938.”’ It should be noted that this figure
does not represent the actual net reproduction rate (which, in fact, was distinctly
lower), but a hypothetical rate if death rates
go the way we all hope they will. Dr. Stocks
further suggests that though “ the war has,
for the time being, reduced the reproduction
rate ...it has also increased the population
of young married women to such an unexpected degree as to make possible a very
substantial rise in the reproduction rate
among women as a whole when the war
ceases.” This speculation seems to neglect
the fact that the increase of marriages in the
first period of the war must necessarily have
resulted in a depletion of our marriageable
stocks; that yesterday’s gains must be
offset by to-morrow’s losses.

The British Medical Journal’s commentary* on Dr. Stock’s letter states that it
‘‘advances sound reasons for discounting
estimations [showing an inevitable decline
in population], and suggests that it is not
certain that the population will diminish.”
Dr. Stocks was in fact more cautious than
his editorial interpreter. He said that a great
fall in population was not inevitable, a very
different thing from denying that some fall
would take place.

In face of these confusions and misunderstandings a re-examination of the most
recent trends in the birth rate may not seem
.amiss. I will begin by bringing up to date
the table included in my paper on ‘“ War
and the Birth Rate,’’ published in the
EuGENICS ReEvIEW of July 194xr. The
revised table shows the quarterly birth rates
in the period 1935-41, expressed as percentages of the average quarterly: ‘birth rates
in the ten years 1921-30. Thus, in 1935 the
birth rate in the March quarter was 78 per
cent of the average rate in the March
quarters during 1921-30; in the June
quarter it was 80 per cent, and so forth.

September... 83 83 83 83 84 78 77
December... 81 82 81 81 79 77 = 82
This table has some interésting aspects.
The heaviest fall has occurred in the births
registered in the second quarter of the year
and next in those registered during the third
quarter. The rise in the ratio for the last
quarter of 1941 should be noted, as also
should the regular course of the ratios up to
1939.

"Being composed of ratios and not of
absolute rates, the table does not bring out
an apparent trend towards a levelling of the
seasonal distribution of births. This however is shown below in a table giving the
actual quarterly birth rates since 1935.

ENGLAND AND WALES

Dec. 13°8 14°0 13°8 13°8 13°5 13°1 433°9
Unlike the pre-war years when the rates
showed a decided preference for the second
quarter, followed by the third, first and
fourth quarters, we notice that in 1941 there
was very little difference in the number of
births registered during the four quarters.
This change in the seasonal distribution of
births suggests that the birth rate of those
parents who plan the births of their children
to take place during the spring and early

16:2 14°2

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

summer has fallen, while the rate for those
who do not so plan their families has risen.
Another suggestion we may make for the
rise in the December ratio from 77 in 1940
to 82 in 1941 is that the organization and
conscription of woman-power announced in
the early months of 1941 has led to the
increased number of births. It should be
noted that if only about 9,000 additional
women conceived during January/March
1941, this would be sufficient to raise the
December birth rate from 13°r in 1940 to
13°9 in 1941.*

Another factor which may account for the
evening out of births over 1941 is the great
increase in marriages during the first year of
the war. Thus marriages were much heavier
than usual in the first and fourth quarters of
1940 and 1941. These facts may well supply
the answer, but they still do not upset our
point of less planning for births to occur
during particular months of the year. The
Registrar-General tells us that “‘ The
intervals between marriage and the first
birth, in 1938, show that about 40 per cent
of women who married before 20 years of
age must have been pregnant before marriage ;
the proportion was about 30 per cent for
those who married at 20, about 20 per cent
for those who married at 21, and declined
with advancing age at marriage to 8 per cent
at 30-34 and 5 per cent at 35-39... . Twothirds of all irregular conceptions not terminated by abortion were regularized by
marriage.’

If we suppose that the war, with its
220,000 additional marriages up to the end
of 1941, has brought to a head an abnormally
high number of attachments among young
couples we should, by applying the 1938
data, expect a rise in the number of births
conceived before marriage. If the years 1940
and 1941 have produced a higher than
average number of such births (first births
be it noted) then the proportion of second
and subsequent births must have fallen

* This supposition is supported by the birth rate of
15°3 for the first quarter of 1942 (announced as we go
to press). This shows a rise of 0-9 per 1,000 population
over the March rate for 1941—roughly, 8, ooo additional
births.

much faster than the total figures indicate.
In other words, we suggest that the war has
produced an unusually high number of first
births from young couples—births that may
or may not have been planned, but do not
appear to have been planned with regard to
the most popular months of the year for conceptions to come to term. We suggest,
further, that this abnormal number of first
births has temporarily cloaked a heavy
reduction in second and subsequent births—
births which would have been produced by
couples married before September 1939 but
for the war.

Until these figures are supported by later
ones our interpretation is merely specula
tive. One reason for caution is that there is a

time lag between the date of birth and registration.. Six weeks are allowed for registration, but even this period may often be
exceeded since a registration fee is charged
only when a birth is not registered within
three months. Hence our suppositions may
be upset by this time lag. On the other hand,
we may: assume that the time lag would
operate fairly evenly from year to year. It is
extremely unlikely, however, that any great
lag has occurred since rationing was introduced, as most parents are anxious to get
the child’s clothing and food books immediately it is born.

Both tables also bring out the first impact
of the war. The first sign of a change in the
regularity of the ratios is the September 1940
figure. That the change should occur at this
point is interesting because the births taking
place during June-September 1940 are those
conceived from September-December 1939—
the first three months of the war.

Also very important in a survey of the
annual changes since 1933 is the number of
women in the 19-30 age-group. Since 1933
the birth rate per 1,000 population has
developed as follows :

1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941

14°4 14°8 14°7 14°8 14°9 15°11 14°9 14°6 14°2
In 1935, when the net reproduction rate
was 0°76, the number of women in the age
group 19-30 was approximately 4,180,000.
By 1939 this figure had fallen steadily by
270,000, whilst the birth rate had risen

steadily up to 1938. This was thus the most
favourable year for the recalculation of the
net reproduction rate. After 1939, however,
the total of women in this age-group rises
steadily up to at least 1942. The same
divergent trends are evident if we take the
19-40 group—roughly, 60,000 more women
in the group in 1942 than in 1938. The
reasons for this can be traced back to the
last war. The 19-30 group in 1935 were born
between 1905 and 1916 (a period of falling
birth rates), whilst the same group in 1942
were born between 1912 and 1923 (a period,
first, of declining rates followed by a few
years of inflated births after the war).
Indeed, 210,000 additional female live births
were registered in 1920 and I9g2I as compared with the 1918-19 figures. Another
factor not to be ignored is the great increase
in marriages since 1938. As compared with
1936-8—years of high marriage rates in
contrast with 1931-3—there were over

220,000 additional marriages during 1939-41.

Yet a further factor is that, in comparison
with the averages for the years 1936-8, there
was an inexplicable drop of 6,500 in the
number of stillbirths during 1940 and 1941.

In the light of these considerations we may
venture on a little elementary arithmetic.
On the basis of the average births for 1936-8

_ there were, roughly, 31,000 fewer births

during 1940-1. On the same basis there were

6,500 fewer stillbirths. The additional

marriages (partly due to the temporarily
higher number of women of marriageable
age) might have been expected to have produced during 1940-1 something like 60,000
births after allowing for the date of marriage
and after applying a fertility rate of 150
births per 1,000 married women. Then we
must add a further 4,000 births for the two
years 1940-1 which represent the additional
illegitimate births (many of these will die
owing to the high illegitimate infant death
rate) which would not have taken place but
for the effects of the war. The total resulting
from all these rough estimates amounts to
101,500, which many represent the number
of unborn casualties during the two years
1940-1. If we remove from the war birth
rates as published the influence of these
12 | THE EUGENICS REVIEW

temporarily favourable factors (more marriageable women, a higher number of married
couples, and probably a lower average age at
marriage), what is the effect ? The answer is
a birth rate as low as 13°2 per 1,000 population or 13 per cent below that for 1938 when
the adjusted net reproduction rate was 0°84.
So close are we to the turning point that, if
the favourable elements had not been
present, or if the number of births in 1941 had
been reduced by less than ro per cent, the
total population of England and Wales would,
for the first time in our history, have declined.

In the absence of more detailed official
statistics we cannot attempt more elaborate
calculations—but broadly speaking, we suggest that there are in the situation we have
described no grounds for optimism. Ina
demographic position favourable to a higher
birth rate we find, underneath the surface, a
serious and continuous fall in reproduction.
Moreover, the loss in unborn casualties to
the end of 1941 exceeds by Ioo per cent the
number of civilians killed by enemy action
from the air.
