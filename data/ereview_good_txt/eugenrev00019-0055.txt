The Population of France

Recent Changes Compared with Those in England and Wales

SOME FACTS

demography of a country by making com
parisons with the experience of its nearest
neighbour. France may thus provide a useful
commentary upon the current demographic
situation in Britain, where, during the last ten
years, significant increases in fertility and population growth have occurred. The following
statement shows the way in which the total
populations of France and England and Wales
have grown year by year since 1954:

In the eight-year period shown, France has
almost caught up with England and Wales in
respect of the total number of inhabitants,
having gained 3-5 million (or 8 per cent) as
against only 2-2 million (or 5 per cent). In both
countries, the rate of increase had speeded up
in the second half of the period; this development has been the more marked over here, and
as a result the two populations grew at more
nearly the same rate during 1960-62.

Can France’s population soon be expected to
surpass that of England and Wales? It may help
to answer this question if the population increments are sub-divided into their components of

births, deaths and net migration, and such an
analysis appears below (numbers in thousands):

FRANCE ENGLAND

AND WALES
1954-57 Births 3225 2765
Deaths 2108 2057

Net Immigration 426 92 (app.)
Total 1543 800
1958-61 Births 3291 3085
Deaths 2019 2133

Net Immigration 728(app.)448 (app.)
Total 2000 1400

From this statement it is apparent that France,
with slightly the smaller total population size
and about the same number of deaths per annum
gains more than England and Wales does from
births and also from net immigration. For both
these sources of increase, the difference between
the two countries has, however, narrowed
during the more recent of the two periods.

The age-distributions of the populations of
the two countries have remained similar over the
last few years and, on average, are broadly as
follows:

FRANCE ENGLAND
AND WALES
7 7”
Under age 20 32 29
Aged 20 and under 60 51 54
Aged 60 and over 17 17
Total 100 140

Thus the higher French birth rate, mirrored
as it is by a greater population of young people
has been achieved by a relatively smaller adult

population of working age; confirmation is
available from the fact that throughout the
eight-year period the average annual number of
marriages in France (312,000) has remained well
below the England and Wales figure (346,000).
The difference between the two countries in their
fertility rates exceeds the difference between
their birth rates.

The extent to which this is so can be seen in
more detail by examining the manner in which
couples married in given years have built up their
families; here are some figures for the numbers
of children born to the marriages of the years
1943 and 1953:

DURATION OF MARRIAGES MARRIAGES

12 2:05 1-87
15 2:20 + 1-99
18 2:28 2:06

Although the statistical basis of these figures
is not identical for both countries, and close
comparisons would not be fully justified, it is
evident that family sizes are appreciably larger
across the Channel. Viewed in this light, the
recent ten-year increase in births in England and
Wales has not brought them to a level up to
which they cannot remain. Indeed, the growth
could conceivably continue for some time to
come. What has been experienced in France
throughout the whole of the post-war period
could quite possibly be seen over here also, and
this would mean even larger families and faster
growth in Britain than has been experienced for
several decades.

NOTE: The figures 46°9 million and “nearly one
million’’ quoted on page 126 are provisional
and may be less accurate than those given
above.
