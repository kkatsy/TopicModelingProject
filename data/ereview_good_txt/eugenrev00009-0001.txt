EUGENICS
REVIEW

‘Man is gifted with pity and other kindly feelings; he

has also the power of preventing many kinds of suffering.
I conceive it to fall well within his province to replace
Natural Selection by other processes that are more
merciful and not less effective. This is precisely the aim

of eugenics’
(Galton 1908)
