DIFFERENTIAL FERTILITY IN 1951
By C. O. CARTER, B.A., B.M., M.R.C.P.

ROBABLY the best index of fertility is

average family size. This takes no

account of those who do not marry, but
is less sensitive than the net reproduction
rate to changes in marriage age and to
temporary postponement of child-bearing.
The Royal Commission on Population
quoted the results of the 1946 family census
to show that differential fertility by social
class was decreasing. Their distinction was,
however, only between non-manual and
manual workers. The publication of Part II
of the One Per Cent Sample Tables* from the
1951 Census provides some new and more
elaborate data. Here married women are
separated into the Registrar-General’s five
social classes and also into more detailed
socio-economic groups. The average fertility
of women, married once only and under 50,
may be calculated from the figures given for

each group according both to duration of

marriage and age at marriage.
The limitation to women under 50 is to
be regretted. It has the effect that the women

who have been married for long durations
are only represented by those among them
who married young. For example, only
women who married at less than 25 years of
age will be recorded in the group married for
25 years or more. The tables therefore do
not provide complete information on average
completed fertility. This limitation is not as
serious as it appears at first, because the best
guide to present trends is given by groups
more recently married, particularly those
who had most of their children since the
end of the 1939-45 war. For example only
women marrying at more than 40 years
of age, and not all of these, will be absent
from the 7 to 9 years duration of marriage
group. The table shown below, derived
from Table X8 of the One Per Cent Sample
Tables shows the average fertility of women
married from 7 to 9 years, subdivided by
socio-economic group and age at marriage.
The figures for marriage duration 5-6 and
10-14 years show the same trends, except
that the greater fertility of women married

fessional and commercial posts is less marked..
The percentages in each age at marriage
group are shown in italic figures above the
figures for average fertility. It will be seen
that some of the figures are based on small
numbers and so are liable to large random
error, but the general picture is reliable.
The two rural groups and the small armed
services group have been excluded.

Perhaps the most striking feature of this
table is that there is very little difference
in fertility between socio-economic classes
from the highest group (including the higher
administrative, professional and commercial
posts) down to the large group of skilled
workers. At this duration of marriage, then,
the population falls into two broad groups :
four-fifths of the population (down to and
including the skilled workers), who are
relatively less fertile, and a smaller group,
about a fifth of the population (semi-skilled
and unskilled workers), who are rather more
fertile. - There is little difference in the
fertility of the two rural groups, but both are
somewhat more fertile than the townsmen.

Another striking feature of the table is
that there are marked differences between
the average age at marriage between the
socio-economic groups. For example only
8 per cent of group 3 wives, but 22 per cent
of group II and 12 wives, were married under
the age of 20. In this respect the skilled worker
group came closer to those below them than
to the non-manual workers. This difference in
age at marriage may well represent a concealed
difference in fertility ; the women who were
married at less than 20 years and were still
under 29 in 1951 are more likely to have
further children than those who married at 27
and were 35 in 1951. Allowance must be
made for this in estimating the size of
completed families. Any such estimate must
be to some extent guess-work, but two tentative estimates have been made and are shown
in the last two columns of the table.

The first estimate assumes that the cohorts
of women classed by socio-economic group
and age at marriage will approximately repeat the pattern of the groups marrying
Io and I5 years earlier. It is assumed, for
example, that group 3 women will average

one-third of a further child for each woman

married under 25 and no further children for.

those -married later than this, and that in
groups 9 and I0 women married at less than
20 years of age will average one further
child, women married between 20 and 24
will average two-thirds of a further child
and women married between 25 and 29 onefifth of a further child. The picture given by
this first estimate is of a non-manual group
comprising about 30 per cent of the population averaging 1-7 children per family, a
middle socio-economic group, about 50 per
cent of the population and including the
foremen and skilled workers, averaging 2-2
children per family and a bottom group,
about 20 per cent, socio-economically averaging 2°5 children per family in the semiskilled and 3 in the unskilled group. Total
average fertility on this estimate is 2-1
children per family. But it is not unreason
able to suppose that knowledge of the means

of family planning has now spread further
through the community and that the essential similarity of the fertility of each age at
marriage group, irrespective of socio-economic group shown at marriage duration of
7-9 years will persist. The second estimate of
completed fertility is based on this assumption and estimates half of a complete child
for each woman married at less than 20,
one-third for those married at 20-24 and
one-fifth for those married at 25-29. This

_ second estimate is shown in the last column

of the table. On this assumption the large
group of skilled workers come close to the
non-manual workers in their completed
fertility, while there is a definite but small
increased fertility in the semi-skilled and
unskilled groups. Total average fertility on
this estimate is 1-9.

These estimates take no account of differences in the proportion of women married.
No information is given on this for individual
socio-economic groups. It is very much to
be hoped that the census in 1961 will repeat

.the questions asked in this census but ask

them of married women of all ages and that
it will also inquire about the proportion of
women unmarried in each socio-economic
group. A further piece of information which

would be valuable is a classification of the »

families in each group by family size. It is
perhaps a matter of common experience that
there are very few large families indeed
among the non-manual workers, an occasional Roman Catholic family providing the
rare exception, that group 3 wives have a

higher proportion of 3 and 4 child families
than other non-manual worker groups, and
that large “ natural’’ families though still
occurring in the two bottom groups, are
rapidly becoming less frequent. But it is
most desirable that these impressions should
be tested on a national scale.
