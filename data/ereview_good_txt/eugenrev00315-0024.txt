NATURAL AND SOCIAL SELECTION

hygiene,’’ according to the Deputy
Registrar-General,* is the all-important agency in relation to death-rates.
He continues, ‘‘ The power of culture to
exert a favourable influence upon mortality,
even in the complete absence of wealth, is
well illustrated in the case of the clergy.
. . Their mortality is remarkably low.
Of 178 occupation groups dealt with in the
recently-published report on occupational

. C ULTURE, extending to matters of

mortality in 1921-23, Anglican clergy occu- 
pied second place.’’ But other factors are
obviously at work in addition, since the
report shows that the comparatively humble
position of 90 is occupied by medical men—
the admitted experts in matters of hygiene ;
whilst, in the same list, place 11 is taken
by agricultural labourers, 27 by foremen at
coal mines, 29 by bricklayers, 62 by coal
hewers, 121 by barristers, 123 by aboveground colliery workers, 159 by undefined
labourers, 165 by dock labourers, and 171
by costermongers and hawkers.

As it is claimed that occupation (males
only, at ages 16-65) gives the surest guide
to wealth, culture, and status, in a general
way, social .gradation on an occupational
basis is adopted for the comparison of mortality. Every occupation distinguished in
the census is assigned to one of five grades.
They are: 1, Upper (Professional, etc.) ; 2,
Intermediate (between x and 3); 3, Skilled
Workmen; 4, Intermediate; and 5, Unskilled Labourers. Grades 1, 3, and 5 are
clearly defined, doubtful cases being put in
2 and 4

Though admitting that the classification
is somewhat rough-and-ready and empirical,
Dr. Stevenson says in evidence of its funda

Statistical Society, Pt. 2, 1928, and the RegistrarGeneral’s Decennial Supplement for England and
Wales, Pt. 2.

mental soundness, ‘‘ The scheme yielded
natality (1921) and mortality (1921-23) rates
varying regularly with the social status,
from a minimum for the highest class (1) to
a maximum for the lowest (5). Taking the
rate for all classes jointly as roo in each
case, natality (births per 1,000 married
males under 55) varies as follows from Class
1 to Class 5: 70, 74, 101, 116, 127; and
mortality as follows : 81, 94, 95, 101, 126.”’

BIOLOGICAL GRADING

The reader of this paper (and, indeed, of
the Decennial Supplement also) is left to
infer that different mortality rates are
almost solely determined by the different
environmental influences associated with,
and corresponding to, the different occupations, and the groups into which they are
gathered. But it seems to the present writer
that the most essential factor, in the partial
success of the classification, goes unrecognised. It is the underlying cause which has
determined in the past, and which determines to-day, the actual personnel of the
different occupations and social grades, that
is of paramount importance. This cause is
natural endowment—natural inheritance.
And the reason why the five grades appear
to have been built up upon the true lines is
really because certain types of occupation,
and certain degrees of wealth and culture, go
generally (not always) hand-in-hand with
corresponding degrees of natural endowment: Occupational grading, in fact, corresponds roughly with a grading in accordance with natural gifts. Consequently it
happens that the higher grades contain
(relatively to their total numbers) a much
greater proportion of individuals of good
inheritance, than do the lower. But every
grade and occupation, of course, embraces
an assortment; and this fact fully explains
most of the anomalies exhibited in the
Report.
NATURAL AND SOCIAL SELECTION

Despite the modifications in the struggle
for existence wrought by advancing civilization, the best-adapted (the fittest) still tend
to rise, and the less fit to fall. This is
indisputable ; it is evidenced on every hand.
There is, therefore, a continual circulation
taking place throughout society: some
going up in the scale, others down, according to their natural gifts. The different
employments in the series mark the milestones; the principal stages are represented
by the social grades. The occupations (and
the grades constructed from them) select
their men. Jn a general way, the higher and
more desirable the occupation, the better are
the natural endowments of those who gain
admission to it; and vice versa. For to
suppose the converse—that the average
casual labourer, for example, possesses
natural equipment superior to the average
skilled craftsman—is obviously to plunge
into absurdity.

But once a man has reached the higher
grades he is subject to the advantages of a
beneficent cycle—good inheritance and good
environment—all making for good. And
there he and his descendants would
assuredly remain, were it not for the occurrence of unfavourable variations, the mating
of fitness with unfitness, and excesses in
eating, in drinking, and in Venere. In class
5, on the other hand, a man encounters all
the adversities of the vicious circle—bad inheritance, bad surroundings—all tending to
his early destruction. But even so, this
unfortunate type of person does not die
out, because it is not only artificially preserved at the expense of the rest of society,
but allowed freely to reproduce its kind!

OCCUPATIONAL SELECTION

For a confirmation of this view we have
only to turn to the Supplement, which contains evidence in abundance. We will
observe how an occupation selects its men
according to their endowment, and how
closely their rates of mortality correspond
to their inheritance, even in spite of unfavourable environment. Let us examine
the vital statistics of coal miners. The calling embraces a large number of men who are
to a great extent segregated into colonies of

99

their own; and the general standard of culture is practically the same for all—the
hewers and others engaged below ground, as
well as those employed above ground, all live
together, side by side, lodging with each
other, and so forth. As is well known,
miners constitute a community of persons
having singularly similar tastes, habits, and
methods of life ; their non-working environment is identical for all. But as workers
they are divided broadly into three main
groups, according to their natural gifts. The
best-endowed are attracted to the occupation
of hewing, which is much the most strenuous and exacting, but usually carries the
highest remuneration. The two remaining
occupations (i.e., other workers below, and
workers above ground) are of a lighter
character, and are shared by the less vigorous men. In each group there are vast numbers continually employed—the largest
being that of hewers, which accounts for
some 460,000 individuals between the ages
of 20 and 65.

The vital statistics show that mortality
falls much more lightly upon those whose
work is hardest and whose environment is
the least favourable, not only for one particular age group, but, generally speaking,
for all. Let us quote from the Supplement.
The mortality ratios at various ages are
given as follows (included for comparison
are corresponding figures for Anglican
clergy, dock labourers, costermongers and
hawkers) :

Anglican Clergy ...
Doek Labourers ...

Costermongers

and Hawkers ---| 166.0 | 181 | 139 [| 172 | 202 | 180 | 142

The relative mortalities of coal miners
from all causes are here clearly shown; and
when one furthermore bears in mind the fact
that hewers have a much higher mortality at

all ages from accident than the above-ground
100

workers, the part played by natural inheritance is strikingly manifested. Nothing
else will explain these great differences. We
must add that mortality rates for foremen
in coalmining are lower still: the job of
foreman exerting an even more severe selective action among competitors. ;

Again, the exceedingly high mortality
rates (see table) for dock labourers and
hawkers can only be accounted for as being
in great part owing to their defective natural
inheritance. Their occupational environment is not usually bad ; much of their work
is in the open air. But their remuneration is
poor, their employment uncertain, and it is
common knowledge that for these reasons
their ranks are chiefly recruited from the
constitutional derelicts of the large towns—
improvidents, idlers, degenerates, ‘ unfits.’
The same remarks apply to another large
group, general undefined labourers. Here
again we observe how the occupation selects
the type, and how closely mortality corresponds to natural inheritance.

CLASS AND LONGEVITY

The following figures (from the Supplement) present the mortality ratios at various
ages for the five occupational grades
(males) :

Social Grade iges 16— | 20— | 25— | 35— | 45— | 55— |65—
20-6

4 Intermediate] 100.7 | 100 | 104 94
3

Unskilled ---) 125.8 | 121 | 116 110

 

It is apparent from this table that as age
increases mortality rates tend towards
equality for all. This is clear evidence of
the mixed character of each grade (and
occupation) from the point of view of inheritance. In each, those of good endowment struggle successfully through the
adversities of their respective environments,
and tend to reach a very similar old age.
But the constitutional weaklings, being far
more numerous in the lower grades (relatively to total numbers), manifest their
presence in the wide differences which are

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

noticeable between grade-mortalities at the
earlier ages.

One may fairly conclude that both environment and inheritance play their parts
in determining mortality, but that by far
the more important of the two is inheritance.

CHILD MORTALITY

A careful study of the official volumes*
relating to the health of our nation leaves one
with a feeling of disappointment and oppression.

As evidence of achievement we are told to
observe the vital statistics of to-day, and
compare them with those of the past. Attention is drawn to the fall in the general
death-rate, and especially to the fall in
infant mortality and in the death-rates of
young children. We are informed that these
figures speak for themselves of a better state
of things. But do they? And are we to
accept them, without question, as proof of a
satisfactory bill of health ?

As we have already seen, with occupied
adults exposed to ordinarily strenuous or
even unfavourable environments, a low mortality rate (as compared with others at the
same period) is closely associated with a
relatively good natural inheritance and fitness. Under tolerably hard general conditions, in fact, a comparatively low death-rate
in any group of persons can be relied upon
always to point to a sound endowment. But
under much softened conditions (when food
and State reliefs are broadcast, and institutional care and nurture easily obtained), a
precisely similar (or even reduced) deathrate might well be compatible with a considerably lower average of inherited gifts.
Accordingly, with infants, in particular,
and with very young children, at different
periods and under widely-different conditions, a falling death-rate may be altogether
deceptive as indicative of an improvement in
inherent healthfulness, since the life of a
most wretchedly-endowed or even mortallyafflicted infant can be amazingly prolonged
by a sedulous system of nursing and
dietary.

Ministry of Health, 1926; Annual Report of the
London County Council, 1926.
NATURAL AND SOCIAL SELECTION

For instance, during 1926 (the year
especially under review) our general deathrate was 11.6 per thousand persons—the
lowest yet recorded; and Sir George Newman (Chief Medical Officer, Ministry of
Health), in his yearly report, makes the
statement that ‘‘ the expectation of life for
a child born in this country to-day is not
less than seventeen years longer than it was
for a child born in 1846.’’ The following
table shows the decline in mortality which
has actually taken place of late in each
year up to five:

 

 

 

Period Deaths see Deaths per 1000 survivors
Ages 0-1 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5
1901-05 41 16 11 8
1926 18 8 5 4

 

The number of infants and young children, therefore, who are being saved to-day
—at any rate for a while—is evident. But
what is the nature of many of these children
saved? In the majority of cases are they
of the best stocks, or of the worst? ‘The
answer in view of the existing differential
death and birth-rates is unfortunately only
too obvious. They are, for the most part,
physical and mental defectives who, under
a sterner régime, would unquestionably
have been eliminated soon after birth by
natural selection. And, unhappily, the more
of such we save the worse becomes the outlook for the State.

In England and Wales, during 1926, there
were 453,804 deaths from all causes at all
ages. Of these, 24,564 were from old age,
18,620 from violence, and the rest from disease of some kind. 173,131 of the deaths
were of individuals under 50 years of age.
In spite of an ample supply of food and its
liberal distribution to all, in spite of all that
is being done for the nation by preventive
medicine (more than was ever done in the
past), in spite of pensions, doles, . reliefs,
welfare centres, venereal centres, and
charities of every description, a very large
percentage of those born every year are of
such enfeebled constitutions that they are
totally unable to reach a _ reasonably
advanced age.

IO!

There were also 53,220 deaths from cancer
during 1926. In other words, of every 1,000
deaths from all causes, 117 were from
cancer. ‘The steady increase in mortality
from this disease in recent times is exhibited
in the following table, which shows the
actual deaths per million of population at
various periods :

Period. Deaths. Period. Deaths.
1847-50 274 1921 1,215
1866-70 403 1924 1,297
1886-90 632 1926 1,362
1906-10 939

These figures, of course, show only the
number of fatal cases recorded. The actual
incidence of this terrible affliction must be
considerably greater, since cure by early
operation has to be taken into account; and
at no time was surgical intervention so
widely practised as it is to-day. Part of the
increase is clearly due to improved diagnosis, and part to the higher age of death—
since cancer is a disease of middle age. But
its hereditary nature is becoming more and
more recognized ; and, it must be asked, are
we snatching lives from the ailments of
infancy only to reserve them for a worse fate
in later life, after they have transmitted
the fatal tendency to their children?

THE TUBERCULAR BURDEN

Although the mortality from tuberculosis
is declining (mainly due to the better general
standard of nutrition of the nation), yet its .
cost is annually increasing. Hosts of new
cases still appear, and the rate of decline
is slower than it used to be.

The total number of sufferers from tuberculosis (as under notification, December,
1926) was 358,133 in England and Wales.
The deaths for the year were 37,525. In
England alone there were 442 dispensaries ;
482 residential institutions with 22,202
beds; besides special schools, etc., devoted
to the treatment of the disease.

The chronicity and incapacitating effects
are well known; the after results of institutional treatment are still discouraging.
Sir George Newman says, ‘‘ The proportion
of patients who have responded well to sanatorium treatment but who relapse within a
comparatively short time after return to
102

ordinary conditions of life and work is unfortunately high.’’

That a very strong tendency to tuberculosis is hereditarily transmitted is notorious.

MENTAL DISABILITY

The following are the numbers of individuals who were under care for insanity on
January rst in certain recent years (England
and Wales): 123,714 in 1922; 126,279 in
1923 ; 131,551 in 1925; and 133,883 in 1926.
Also, 15,786 were under care for mental
deficiency in 1923, and 19,376 in 1925.

But these figures greatly understate the
real incidence of the mischief. Dr. Tredgold believes that there are more M.D.’s
than insane in the country. He also says:
“‘T think we shall be well within the mark
in saying that the total number of persons
suffering from certifiable mental disease in
England and Wales is over 1 per cent., and
perhaps nearer 2 per cent. of the general
population.’”? This would amount to considerably more than half a million individuals. In addition, however, to this vast
figure he thinks that there is an even greater
number of border-line cases (uncertifiable),
epileptics, neurasthenics, and the like.

There is every reason to believe that all
these conditions are becoming more and
more widely disseminated by intermarriage.
Dr. Tredgold further says: ‘‘ An overwhelming proportion of cases of mental disease must be regarded as primarily due to
innate and not to external causes.”’ He
estimates that about four-fifths of all cases
of mental deficiency are hereditary in origin.

The death-roll from influenza has risen
rapidly. The following table, in decennial
periods since 1870, shows the average number of deaths per year in each period (England and Wales) :

1871-80 1881-90 1891-1900 IQOI-10 19II-20
263 534 II,051 7,318 21,641
During the whole of the last period influ
enza accounted for nearly as many deaths
as diphtheria, measles, scarlet fever, and
whooping cough combined. In 1918 there
were no fewer than 112,329 deaths from
influenza. It is to be particularly noted that
although all ages were attacked, yet the
disease showed an especial ruthlessness to

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

early adult life, a very high peak in the
mortality occurring about age 30.

In view of these things the question naturally suggests itself—Are we rearing up to
adult life a nation having a large percentage
of highly vulnerable individuals with low
general resisting powers, who, under the
stress of slightly less favourable conditions,
fall an easy prey to disease and perish prematurely by thousands?

THE BURDEN OF PAUPERISM

This table reveals the growing expenditure under the Poor Law:
Years ending Total Annual

March 31st Expenditure
1914 $15,055,863
1920 23,501,241
1924 37,882,282
1926 40,083,455
1927 (estimated) 49,500,000

The sharp rise in 1926-27 was, of course,
due to industrial troubles. But the following
remark of the Minister of Health is well
worth bearing in mind, ‘“‘ It is not generally
realised that during the past six years numbers of young men, without employment and
maintained on Poor Law relief, have
married, securing thereby an increase in
their income from relief, and have had
families, each addition to the family bringing its addition to the family income.”’

It must furthermore be remembered that
huge and increasing sums are being paid out
yearly in unemployment benefit, disablement benefit, widows’ and orphans’ and old
age pensions. Thus:

Year. Unemployment
benefit.

1924 4£37,874,490 £23,800,000 (approx.)
1925 45,814,762 26,200,000 (approx.)
1926 = 50, 201,758 27,800,000 (approx.)
This expenditure should cover the ‘ bad
luck ’ cases and remove from the Poor Law
all except the definitely defective. The
National Health Insurance records show
that during 1926 there was a loss of at least
28% million weeks’ work owing to sickness,
“or the equivalent of twelve months’ work
of upwards of 540,270 persons.’’ ‘‘ ‘The total
benefit payments under the scheme in 1926
for England and Wales, including medical

penefit charges, amounted to £28,584,000,
and in the same period the amount collected
m contributions was £21,982,000, and the
Btate prant was £6,255,000.”’ These figures
Mave been rising yearly.
Nearly 60 per cent. of the total insured
Mersons are under medical treatment every
pear for varying lengths of time. Clearly
here is a great deal of unfitness even
amongst the picked workers of the nation.
& Readers will remember that in 1917-18
Rhe discovery was made that of 2,425,184
men of military age, only three in every
mine were perfectly fit. Since the War, from
Ho to 80 per cent. of those applying for
; my enlistment have been rejected as unfit ;
while it is significant that the height for
Bdmission to the Guards regiments has been
mereasingly lowered of recent years. Again,
m5 per cent. of those offering themselves for
fhe Police Force are rejected.
fF In spite of 2,324 maternity and child
welfare centres (in England alone costing
early £2,000,000 per year), and of at least
8963 health visitors, and of day-nurseries
and the like, Sir George Newman tells us
Rhat about 35 per cent. of children entering
; hool have physical defects of some kind.
t During 1926 about 1,000 children (at age
h) from various parts of England were
eficially examined in order to sample their
meneral physical condition. In round figures,
ag per cent. showed signs of rickets, about
fg per cent. had enlarged tonsils, 10 per
ent. enlarged tonsils and adenoids, 7 per
nt. ear discharge, 24 per cent. dental
ecay, 144 per cent. cardiac affection, etc.
S The next facts relate to London school
Bildren, who, for practical purposes, may
e taken as typifying school children in
Rneral. The following table shows the
Mmber found (in 1926) at routine medical
Aspection to require treatment for defects

pavers (age 1334) 63,099 11,112 17.6

103:

The fluctuation is peculiar, but reveals that
the percentage of children requiring treatment instead of declining after entering
school, seems rather to increase, despite a
death-rate in some degree selective.

Of the entrants, 46 per cent. suffer from
dental decay, 15 per cent. have severe caries,
with septic gums. It is stated in the Report
that ‘“‘ these figures show no diminution.”’

Of the first three groups 5.5 per cent.
were referred for treatment for tonsils and
adenoids; 5.2 per cent. for enlarged glands
in the neck—an increase of recent years
(says the Report).

Of 8-year-old children no less than 51.9
per cent. of the boys, and 54.7 per cent. of
the girls failed to pass the test for normal
vision.

Besides cases requiring treatment, many
thousand others are marked as “‘ requiring
observation.’’ Also, multitudes of instances
of heart, lung, and nervous defects, as well
as all kinds of deformities were brought to
light during these routine inspections at the
ordinary elementary schools.

But, it must be remembered, in estimating
the total amount of unfitness in children,
that there are now many special places for
the reception of the more defective, schools
for the blind and the partially blind, for the
deaf and hard-of-hearing; open-air schools
and camps; schools for the mentally defective; epileptic colonies; and so _ forth.
Furthermore, there exist a certain number
who are altogether unfit for any kind of
school.

In an article in the English Review
(March, 1927) Mr. Ludovici brought forward official statistics which demonstrated
that, although general cleanliness and clothing had improved in school children, yet in
recent years the percentage of Ar individuals (both boys and girls) was definitely
declining, also that sickness (especially
rheumatic and heart trouble, chorea and
nervous disorders) had increased following
the decline in infant mortality.

‘* The school medical service,’ says the
London school medical officer (Dr. Menzies),
““is a receiver of damaged goods and spends
most of its time and energies in patching
them up.’’ But he appears to think that

’
104

the ‘damage’ takes place between birth
and the age of going to school. Then why
has the ‘damage’ increased during the
years when pre-school care has improved ?

THE INVISIBLE COST

That the cost of unfitness is each year
rapidly increasing is evidenced on every
hand. But the total amount cannot be precisely estimated, since some of it is borne
by local authorities, some by State grants,
and much again by voluntary aid. Besides
actual expenditure, other factors have to be
considered. Not only do the unfit require

maintenance, but they are inefficient ang
unproductive—a dead loss to the State #
every way. The labours of a great numbe
of highly efficient persons needed for thei
care, are withdrawn from other purposes ig
consequence. This is true alike of paid
State-oficials, voluntary philanthropy
workers, and relatives of ‘ unfits’ in thd
home circle. Were it not for the existenof
of so many ‘ unproductives,’ more fi
individuals would unquestionably be borg
every year. 3

How long can any nation continue to bear
the growing strain? ;

A CURE FOR STERILITY
