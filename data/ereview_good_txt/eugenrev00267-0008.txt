A NOTE ON THE INTELLECTUAL
DIFFERENCES OF THE SEXES
By B. S. BRAMWELL, MA., ERS.

mental make-up of the two sexes? It

occurred to me some time ago that the
Cambridge Tripos lists would repay study.
This paper is an abbreviation of the full
results of my inquiry.

Since 1880 or thereabouts the numbers of
women competing for honours have grown
to considerable figures. Have the numbers
in any particular subject tended to increase
more than in others? And do women fare
relatively better or worse than men and this
in very varying studies? Any conclusions,
however, must be tempered by the fact that
female education is still largely dominated
at the top by the male, and certainly the
examination papers in the various triposes
are mostly set by men, for men and corrected
by men.

The period I investigated first was from
1880 to 1910. I divided it into three periods.
Ig1r to 1920 was broken by the war and,
at the time of my examination, the later
decades had not been completed.

Let us look at the Mathematical Tripos,
taking first mere quantity. The technique I
have followed is to put down the numbers of
men and women, total them and then express
each as a percentage of the whole.

1902-1910 600 152 752 80 20
Total 2,573 423 2,996 86 14

The number of men taking the tripos has
fallen in each decade. The number of women
increased considerably in the second decade.
Women formed 8 per cent of the candidates

in the first decade, 16 per cent in the second

and 20 per cent in the third.
The classes taken by the candidates are
set out in the following tables.

Total 872 200 1,072 82 18

At this stage it is possible to draw some
tentative conclusions. Both the fall in the
number of men and the increase in the
number of women appear to have been
among the more indifferent candidates.

Perhaps this will be clearer from the percentage figures for women alone. If women
were equal to men in aptitude for mathematics and in mathematical training, one should
find that the percentage in each class was the
same as the percentage in the total.

As a “ first vintage ’’ we may say that, for
some reason or reasons unknown, women are
perhaps not so well adapted to pursue
mathematics as men.

Taking next the Classical Tripos, the

‘figures are as follows:

A NOTE ON THE INTELLECTUAL DIFFERENCES OF THE SEXES 45

The number of men has remained fairly
constant; the women candidates show a
slight increase. The percentage increase of

-women is much less than in the Mathematical
Tripos.

For reasons of space the full figures for the
classes taken by the candidates are omitted
and the following data are limited to a table
of percentages.

WoMEN AS PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CANDIDATES

1882-1910 II 5 II 15

Here again we may state that for reasons
unknown women have not done so well as
men.

Taking now the Natural Science Tripos,
the figures are :

Total 2,972 309 3,281 gI 9

The number of men taking the tripos
increased enormously during the period. A
great many of these were probably men who
in earlier years would have taken mathematical tripos in which the numbers were falling
during the period under review. Women
candidates increased but not quite in the
same proportion as the men.

Making a table as before of the percentages
of women candidates :

WoMEN AS PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CANDIDATES

Total 1st Class 2nd Class 3rd Class
1881-1890 II 12 13 7
1891-1900 9 6 12 9
IQOI-1910 8 4 13 8
1881-1910 9 6 13 8

Though the women again fall behind in the
first class, the position as a whole is much
less pronounced. One would be inclined to
say that there is much less difference between
the achievement of the sexes than in the
Mathematical or Classical Triposes.

Another tripos in which the figures are
large is the Historical Tripos. Treating it in
the same way the total figures are :

Percentage

Men Women Total Men Women
1881-1890 209 46 255 82 18
1891-1900 305s: 148 453 67-33
IQOI-I9IO0 637 146 783 81 19
Total 1,151 340 1,491 | 77 23

Here there has been a great rise in the
number of candidates. In the second decade
the men increased by 50 per cent and the
women more than trebled their numbers.
In the third decade, the men doubled their
number in the second decade but the
women’s numbers remained stationary.

The women’s percentage figures are :

Total 1st Class 2nd Class 3rd Class
1881-1890 18 38 21 6
1891-1900 33 35 38 28
1901-1910 19 18 23 14
1881-1910 23 29 27 17

In this subject we get results very different
from those in the subjects previously considered. The women have done undoubtedly
better than the men, though this was most
pronounced in the first decade when the
numbers were small. As the numbers increased the disparity lessened and indeed in
the last decade was barely noticeable.

In the Medieval and Modern Languages
Tripos the women outnumber the men.

The women’s percentage figures are:

1886-1910 59 65 65 47

As in the History Tripos the women have
done relatively better than the men, though
again in the last decade where the numbers
are greatest the difference is very slight.

In the Moral Science Tripos the figures are
very small and very constant :

1891-1900 52 29 gI 57 = 43

46 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Taking the women’s percentages as before :

Total 1st Class 2nd Class 3rd Class
1881-1890 33 22 41 29
1891-1900 43 40 54 37
IQOI-I910 31 33 37 22
1881-1910 36 33 43 30

The subject does not seem to have offered
much attraction to either sex. So the figures
are small. They do not suggest any very
marked difference between the two sexes.

The Economics Tripos covers only six
years: the total figures are only 61. For
what they are worth they do not suggest
much difference between the two sexes.

The women’s percentages are :

Total 1st Class 2nd Class 3rd Class
30 33 32 20

Looking at mere numbers, the women
have increased most numerically in the
Medieval and Modern Languages Tripos.
This seems wise on their part, for our figures
certainly suggest that they do better in this
subject than the men. In the History Tripos
their numbers in the third decade were more
than three times those in the first decade and
here again they have done well. In the
Natural Science Tripos their increase has
been proportionate to that of the men. In
the Mathematical Tripos and the Classical
Tripos, there has been an increase but of a
lesser magnitude. These are the subjects in
which they seem to have done worst. In the
Moral Science Tripos, their numbers like
those of the men are nearly stationary. So
on the whole their selection of subjects seems
wise.

When one comes to quality it is not so
easy to dogmatize. In Mathematics and
Classics the men have undoubtedly a greater
percentage of firsts and a smaller percentage
of thirds. In History and Medieval and
Modern Languages the position is reversed.
In Science men have a greater proportion of
firsts but have if anything done rather worse
than the women at the other end of the
scale. The same seems true of Moral Science
to a lesser degree but the total figures
involved are very small.

We can get some further data as regards
the relative position of men and women in
the first class of the Mathematical and

Classical Tripos. Until the final year of our.
period candidates in the Mathematical
Tripos were placed in order of merit. Thirtyone women were so placed amongst the
Wranglers the number of whom was generally
between 25 and 35; the mean therefore was
not very different from thirty-one.

7 women ranked in the first ten
6

i » »» » second ten
17 ” ” ” ” third ten
and 1Iwoman s,, » », fourth ten

Other things being equal, the expectation
would be an even distribution of 10 throughout.

In the Classical Tripos the First Class is
divided into three divisions. During the
period I21 men and 5 women were placed in
I. i. From the relative numbers taking the
Tripos one would have expected to find 15
women so placed.

We might try and give an average figure
for all candidates and compare that figure
for men and women candidates. Supposing
we allow 3 marks for a first, 2 for a second
and 1 for a third, total them and divide by
the number of candidates. How far this
would make a comparison of much value, I
cannot say, but for what it is worth, here are
the figures. |

So much for the Cambridge figures for the
period 1880 to 1910. We must not stretch
conclusions too far from the results. Examinations have a proved correlation to aftersuccess in life, but of what magnitude?
When all is said and done I think we may be
justified in expecting to find some sex
difference in aptitude, say for the study of
Mathematics and of Modern Languages.

Our conclusions may be tested by considering other periods and other places.

I examined the Oxford Historical Register
Ig00-1920 and extracted the figures for this
period (rg01-1920) from the honours lists.
There are four classes at Oxford as against
A NOTE ON THE INTELLECTUAL DIFFERENCES OF THE SEXES 47

three at Cambridge. The totals for the 20
years are as follows :

I give as in the Cambridge Lists the
women’s percentage figures :

Lit. Mod. 61 55 63 68 50
Lit. Hum. 3 2 4 3 3
Hist. Mod. 19 16 25 16 12

Some deductions may be drawn from these
lists. Taking the percentage of the total as
a standard, in no list did the women make
their percentage in the first class ; in every
list they slightly exceeded it in the second
class ; in the fourth class they only exceeded
their percentage in one case out of six.

I made out a table as before, to demonstrate in a rough and ready way, the average
class taken by men and women. As there are
four classes, I allocated 4 points for a first,
3 for a second, 2 for a third and 1 for a fourth
class.

The results are as follows :

Men Women Difference
Math. 3°03 2°35 +0-68
Science 2°74 2°60 +0°14
Lit. Angl. 7 2°62 2°52 +o-10

Lit. Hum. .... 2°66 2°68 —0'02
Hist. Mod. ... 2°34 2°38 —0°04

As to choice of subjects, very few women
took Mathematics, possibly wisely as not one
of the 21 women candidates got a first class,
whereas roughly 40 per cent of the men
achieved this distinction. On the other hand,
more women took Modern History than any
other subject and in this subject they did
very well. Except in one instance (Lit. Hum.)
these results are quite in accord with those
of Cambridge, two-thirds of which referred
to an earlier date.

Finally I examined the Cambridge lists for
the period 1931 to 1939. Numbers of candidates had greatly increased. I have omitted
the Moral Science Tripos, as the number of
candidates during the period was only 52
(41 men and rr women). I included the
Economics Tripos where the numbers are
now considerable.

Here is a table of the average class taken :

Comparing this with the previous table
which refers to a much earlier period there
is very little difference. The Oxford table
too differs only markedly in the position of
the Classics, but here we are not really
comparing similar things.

When we come to consider Nature and
Nurture we must be guarded. The results
observed seem to persist irrespective of time
and place. In the case of Mathematics the
differences in favour of the male are too
striking to be explained entirely by Nurture.
Why should we suppose he has been better
taught over a period of 60 years when we
do not have a similar discrepancy in other
subjects? In these we nearly always find
women are below their quota in the First
Class and also the Third Class. Languages
seem to be an exception. It looks as if
women here did better than men. Otherwise, women seem to cluster more closely
round their mean. It may be that there
is more inducement for the best men to
go “all out” for a high place though this

is rather doubtful. I think it is probable
that women are more conscientious than
men, many of whom are distracted from their
work by the inducements of sport and games,
success in which for men contemplating
teaching as a profession may even have a
commercial value. I am inclined to think
that the men tend to show what are generally
considered to be Nordic characteristics and.
the women those considered Mediterranean.

The ultimate career of the women graduates would make an interesting study. From
the lists of graduate members of Girton and
Newnham in the latest Cambridge Calendar,
one gathers that one third of them have
married. As these lists include many who
have just recently graduated, it is probable
that the marriages are far from complete.
So probably more than 40 per cent marry.
If it be true, as is said, that 50 per cent of
girl babies born eventually marry, then over
60 per cent. of girls reaching the age of 20
will marry, which is undoubtedly a much
higher marriage rate. What size of families
have women graduates? I think we should
mostly anticipate small ; but without knowing such a guess might be hazardous. Casting
my mind over cases well known to me, the
first four which occurred to me averaged
families of five!
