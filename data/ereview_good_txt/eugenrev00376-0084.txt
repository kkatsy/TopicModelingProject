412 . EUGENICS REVIEW

Gerrard, THE Rev. THomas J. Zhe Church and Eugenics. (No. IV.,
Catholic Studies in Social Reform.) P.S. King and Son; 6d. net.
THE greater part of this book calls for no special comment: it
has been written (and reviewed) about twenty times already,
written in slightly different words by slightly different authors
with slightly different misconceptions of the meaning of Eugenics,
but substantially the same. It contains the usual isolated quotation from Galton as gloriously shocking in its divorce from its context as Friday’s footstep alone on the shore, the usual assertion that
Dr. Inge is a bad, wicked man (or words to that effect), and the usual
implication that Eugenics and Purity are divergent and alternative
ideals. Whether the object of this is to set a few credulous gossips
against Eugenics, or merely to amuse the author, is more than we can
tell. The only novelties in the book are the word “ Mendelianism,”
and a heroic attempt to defend the Church’s practice of celibacy as “ the
best possible thing for race culture.” The boldness of this amazing
argument amply compensates for the thinness of its logic. Putting aside
the cruder absurdities, the author’s case for Monasticism rests on the
statement that charitable and devotional character is not heritable. The
proof of this statement is not tedious: it may be quoted in full. It consists of one word, “obviously.” That, of course, settles it. Eugenics
is dead. W. Hope-JOngEs.
