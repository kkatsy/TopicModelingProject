A PRACTICAL METHOD FOR THE
MEASUREMENT OF SOCIAL COMPETENCE”

By EDGAR A. DOLL, Pho.
(Director of Research, The Training School at Vineland, New Jersey)

SURVEY of family history studies
indicates that there is an important
need in the field of eugenics for a prac
tical method of measuring the general level
of social ability. The problem of eugenics is
one of increasing the number of the socially
fit by selective mating and reducing the
number of the socially unfit by curtailing
their reproduction. This problem requires a
scientific understanding of the mode of
hereditary transmission of human ability
before sound administrative programmes for
race betterment can be advocated. Our
thesis is that quantitative measurement must
replace qualitative estimation if the inheritance of human traits is to be clearly
understood.

Our notions of social competence have been
closely identified with concepts of general
intelligence, as reflected in genius or mental
deficiency. We need direct measures of social
ability as a practical expression of intelligence, and we need these for the whole distribution of ability as well as for the extremes
of superiority and inferiority. Without such
measurement methods, field work in family
history studies is likely to be wishful or
prejudiced, and the definite influence of such
variables as age, sex, environment, and the
like cannot be allowed for. To infer a mode
of transmission without adequate measurement leads to loose definition and encourages logical confusion of cause and effect.

If we could employ an instrument approximating laboratory accuracy for measuring
social competence at successive age levels, for
both sexes, and in varied environments,
which would provide quantitative data of
known reliability and validity, we could

make definite advances in standardizing
field work and in obtaining a better understanding of the laws of hereditary transmission of social competence. If by means of
such a device we could examine an individual
either in person or i” absentia by a simple
standardized schedule, we might expect to
extend the scope of family history studies to
persons who are inaccessible by reason of
death or geographical isolation. And if we
could verify our measurements by reexamination of the same person by the same
schedule from different approaches, we could
greatly increase the reliability of the evidence
on which eugenical programmes must be
based.

The Vineland Scale

These considerations induce us to call
attention to the Vineland Social Maturity
Scale. This is a standardized device for the
measurement of general social competence
from birth to maturity as a developmental
or maturation process. The scale was
originally devised to measure the social
abilities of persons suspected of mental
deficiency, in order to satisfy the first criterion of mental deficiency, social incompetence. The basic method is the same as
that employed by Binet and Simon in their
measuring scale of general intelligence. Just
as Binet’s concept of general intelligence was
based upon a hierarchy of adaptive performances each of which reflected a general
factor of intelligence, so our scale is based on
a succession of behavioural items each of
which reflects personal independence and
social responsibility.

This scale assumes that individual growth
and development are accompanied by a
maturation of behaviour which is socially
significant and which represents the practical

expression of increase in related abilities.
The infant at birth is helpless and dependent.
As he grows up, he “ takes over’ more and
more responsibility for his own care, gradually extends the scope of his personal responsibility to the management of his own affairs,
and ultimately dominates the affairs of others.
In infancy this increasing social competence is expressed principally as self-help,
in adolescence as self-direction, and at
maturity as an assumption of responsibility
for the needs of others. In senescence the
individual may again become dependent in
the completion of the life cycle.

In formulating the modus operandi of
social competence, we have employed six
major expressions of social independence and
responsibility, namely; self-help, locomotion, communication, occupation, self-direction, and socialization. Each of these major
categories of social behaviour has for our
purposes been reduced to a succession of
specific performances which increase in complexity with advance in age. Each detailed
performance has its own maturation period
or growth curve which reflects individual
differences in rate of development. The
central tendency of each growth curve can
be calculated and its dispersion determined in
statistical terms. The sum of the item performances can be expressed as a total score
which reflects the degrees of maturation in
social competence. The scores can be expressed as central tendencies for successive
life-age groups and thereby expressed as
“social ages ’’’ which are methodologically
and statistically comparable to Binet mental
ages. Individual variation from these central
tendency age scores can be calculated, and
the influence of such variables as sex, race,
cultural level, and the like, can be investigated. The items of the scale avoid the
measurement of intelligence, personality,
habit, skill, and the like, as such, focusing
instead on the composite capitalization of
such abilities for socially significant
behaviour.

The method is not a rating scale, but is a
genuine measurement device. It does not
require the direct examination of the person
concerned. On the contrary, information

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

regarding the person examined is obtained
through an informant who is intimately
acquainted with the habitual social behaviour of the person examined. This aspect
of this scale is a decided advantage, since it
provides measurement of a subject without
requiring his presence. However, a person
may be examined directly by acting as his
own informant.

We need not describe this device in detail
here. Preliminary reports* describing the
method and presenting experimental evidence of its standardization, its reliability,
its validity, and the influence of numerous
variables have already been made, and
additional reports of greater scope are now
being prepared summarizing an extensive
body of experimental data obtained over a

period of several years. We may for present
purposes state, somewhat dogmatically, that
the scale is a calibrated instrument of known
precision, and that the reliability and validity
of the data are already known with some
assurance. The scale has been successfully
employed with the blind, the deaf, the
crippled, the feeble-minded, and other mentally, physically, and socially handicapped
groups. It is known to provide standard
measures which can be verified by repeated
examination and within known limits of
error.

Value of the Scale

Our present purpose is to suggest that this
scale affords a practical method for field
work in family history studies. A preliminary
investigation has been made, not so much to
investigate the influence of heredity and
environment, as to demonstrate the practicability of the method. This preliminary investigation amply supports our supposition
that the scale has definite advantages over
the customary methods of field work investigation. For example :

1. It provides a measure rather than an
estimate of general social competence
which has a known value and a known
relation to other measures of human
aptitudes and abilities.

2. It provides results by means of which
the relative influence of environment
and heredity can be investigated in
quantitative terms and in relation to
known variables.

3. It is simple to learn, easy to use, requires no apparatus, invites co-operation, avoids antagonism, and yet provides systematic data which approximate other accepted measures of laboratory precision.

4. It does not require the presence of the
person examined, but does permit such

direct examination. It affords a standard measurement of a person who may
be inaccessible through death or through
geographical isolation.

5. It yields objective measures of various
degrees of social competence. These
measures are verifiable and comparable
and can be interpreted in statistical
terms and clear concepts.

A number of investigations have already
been conducted bearing on the laboratory
and experimental details of the method. The
results of these studies can be applied directly
to field work data, thus making unnecessary
independent field studies of variable influences. This device is therefore immediately available as a practical instrument in
field work, but of course it will be advisable
to carry out a more protracted investigation
of the special conditions encountered and the
special modifications necessary for field work
on a large scale.
