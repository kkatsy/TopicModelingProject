Younger Marriages in England and

Wales and the Consequences

for Fertility |

SOME

OME REFERENCE TO proportions married in
this country and their variations was made
on page 60 of the April, 1961 issue of the
REVIEW. It is regretted that one of the figures
shown there was incorrect. The proportion
married for men aged 15—19 should have been,
not 0-041, but 0-004.
The number of marriages
Wales in recent years have
(thousands):

in England and
been as follows

1931

1938
1951-55 (average)
1956-60 (average)
1962

312
362
351
345
348

Apart from a deficit in 1931 (economic
depression) and an excess in 1938 (economic
recovery and anticipation of war) the numbers
do not exhibit a very notable trend. The ages
at first marriage have, however, moved steadily
in one direction, as the following averages show:

BACHELORS SPINSTE
1931 27:3 25-5
1938 27:7 25°6
1951-55 (average) 26°6 24-2
1956-60 (average) 25°9 23°5
1962 25°5 23-0

A fall of more than two years in the average
within 25 years represents a change of considerable demographic and social implications. In
view of the potential effect on fertility of the
trend towards younger marriages, it is worth
while to examine it in more detail; the following
tables show the proportions of all marriages
that have occurred in specific age-groups:

BACHELORS
15-19 20-24 25-29 30-34 35 &over Total
1931 2 37 41 12 8 100
1938 2 34 41 15 8 100
1951-55 3 48 31 10 8 100
1956-60 5 52 27 9 7 100
1962 7 53 25 8 7 100
SPINSTERS
1931 10 48 28 8 6 100
1938 11 46 28 9 6 100
1951-55 19 34 16 5 6 100
1956-60 25 53 13 4 3 100
1962 30 50 11 4 3 100

In theory a shift of a certain proportion of
first marriages from one age to another in
Britain need not make any difference to the size
of the family the couple may have, in view of
the fact that family planning is very widely and
successfully employed in this country. In practice, the relativities between the numbers of
children born to couples marrying at different
ages have remained comparatively constant in
spite of changes in the level of fertility and shifts
in the marriage-pattern, as the following index
figures of relative family size show; that for age
25-29 at marriage is standardized at 100:

AGE OF WOMAN AT MARRIAGE
Marriages of 15-19 20-24 25-29 30-34 35-39 40-44
1900-09 1

92 142 100 76 47 25
1929 207 143 100 70 40 14
1939 177 «127. S100 72 35 10
1949 (est.) 172 123 100 74 37 12

It is too early to give a firm estimate for
marriages contracted later than 1949, as familybuilding is too incomplete for the younger
married couples.

As an example of the effect of earlier marriages

upon family size, the average of the fertility index
figures for 1939 shown above, if weighted with
the 1938 distribution of marriages, is 114.
Correspondingly, the average of the 1949
figures, if weighted with the 1951-55 distribution
of marriages, is 120, an increase of 5 per cent.
It is not outside the bounds of possibility that
the total extent to which marriages are now

occurring at younger ages, as compared with
before the War of 1939-45, may have been
reflected in up to a ten per cent increase in
average family size, or nearly one-quarter of a
child per couple. To this, or more probably a
lesser extent, younger marriages in recent years
have contributed to the recent rise in the birth
rate in England and Wales.
