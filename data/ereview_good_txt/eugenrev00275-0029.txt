A STUDY OF THE INTELLIGENCE OF
ANGLO-CHINESE CHILDREN

By P. C. HU
(From the Depariment of Psychology, University College, London)

I. OBJECT OF THE INQUIRY

HE present investigation was carried
out with the object of determining the

general intellectual level of AngloChinese children, and of discovering what
differences, if any, exist between their
general standard of intelligence as compared
with that of English children, selected from
the same social environment. With this
object in view the East End of London and
Liverpool were chosen as the most suitable
districts in which to carry out the main
portion of the research. Anglo-Chinese communities have existed in these districts for
nearly a century, and small groups of halfcaste children are here easily accessible to the
investigator. To obtain precise information
about the population, and particularly about
the numbers of half-caste children residing
in these areas, is by no means easy. In
London they are scattered over many different schools, and accordingly the simplest
plan seemed to be to choose the chief
examinees from the Chung Hwa Club* for
Anglo-Chinese children, and to test them in
the club itself. The children attending this
club must be of Chinese parentage ; otherwise, no special qualification is necessary
and no fee is paid, the members therefore
forming a group typical of the total AngloChinese population. In Liverpool the halfcaste children are nearly all grouped together
in the three schools; these therefore were
tested in the school itself. :
In both London and Liverpool the children

* The Chung Hwa Club is, in brief, an institution
founded in 1928 for the benefit of Anglo-Chinese children in Limehouse. Voluntary workers arrange numerous useful and enjoyable extra-school activities, such as
sports meetings, first-aid classes, etc. Evening courses
are provided in which the children are taught (in English) about China and Chinese life and instructed in the
elements of the Chinese language.

of mixed parentage form only a small
minority ; and it would be useless to compare them with a paired control group containing an equally small number of English
children. We need, if possible, to compare
the average intelligence of both communities estimated as a whole. The method
here adopted was to test the entire number
of English children at the five London schools
which the majority of the Anglo-Chinese

‘children were attending. In Liverpool, to

obtain sufficient numbers the English children were tested at five schools: three of
the schools were attended by Anglo-Chinese,
the other two by English children only, but
the social status and economic conditions
were much the same as those of the halfcastes.

2. SUBJECTS, TESTS, AND METHODS

The total number of children tested was
2,943 English and 116 Anglo-Chinese. This
number was divided into two groups, namely
(a) those between 8-10 years of age, and (5)
those between I1-14 years of age. The latter
group was tested (a) with the Northumberland Standardized Tests,* and (6) with
perceptual tests.t As the standard of these
two tests was considered to be too difficult
for the younger children between 8 and Io, a
further test, namely, the opposites test (Test
2 of Northumberland Standardized Tests)
was employed. After the completion of these
group tests, a performance test of intelligencet was used with every half-caste and

the University of London Press. Only the General
Intelligence part was used.

and others.

Psychology (1934), by the same authors.

with a group of representative or average
English children from London and Liverpool
who were selected in the following way. Between I1-14 years of age the averages were
determined by the Northumberland group
test. Between the ages of 8 and 10, the average children were chosen by means of the
Opposites Test. The number of average
children thus selected was, as a rule, ten from
each group—five boys and five girls. They
were chosen so that the home environment,
social and economic status, father’s trade and
earnings were as similar as possible to those
of Anglo-Chinese children. In some cases,
however, it was found that one or more of
the conditions under consideration did not
conform to the ideal basis of selection. Hence
the numbers of children in any particular
age group are not always exactly identical.
No English children of 14 were selected for
individual testing. This is the school-leaving
age in elementary schools, and consequently
a sufficient number of the children could not
be obtained.

In all, in both London and Liverpool, 107
English children, aged 8-13, were thus
selected.

3. DESCRIPTION OF RESULTS

Differences obtained with the Northumberland
Tests
With the Northumberland Tests, the
Anglo-Chinese show consistently better results than the English children (see Table [).

Expressed in terms of marks, their superiority is shown in the first column of Table IT
below.

Having seen from the above table how the
Anglo-Chinese and English children compare
with each other, we may now proceed to a
comparison of the marks of the half-castes
with the standard of norms. This shows that,
judged by the standard norms for the general
population, the Anglo-Chinese in London are
practically up to the average at 11 and 12
years of age; at 13 years, however, their
marks are little above the theoretical norm
of a child of 12; while at 14 the average
mark of the Anglo-Chinese child differs but
slightly from the norm of a child of 13.*

With regard to the East End English
children, the marks show that the average
score of the children of 11 here tested is

* It must be remembered, however, that the norms
represent averages for the entire school population and
include a due proportion of brighter children who
ordinarily leave the elementary schools for the central
and secondary schools.
A STUDY OF INTELLIGENCE OF ANGLO-CHINESE CHILDREN

approximately two marks below the norm
of the average Londoner of 10; at 12 years,
the score is equivalent to that of an average
Londoner of about 11-33 years of age. The
score obtained at 13 years of age is slightly
lower than the norm for a child of 11, while
at 14 years of age it is somewhat lower than
that of the 13-years-old children.

In Liverpool the Anglo-Chinese again show
greater proficiency in the Northumberland
Test than the English. This is demonstrated
in Table I. No comparison could be made in
Liverpool between children of 14, since it was
impossible to get into touch with AngloChinese children of this age. It is interesting
to note that at every age both the English
and Anglo-Chinese children in London
showed greater proficiency in performing
the test than did those of Liverpool.

With regard to the English children tested,
in London and Liverpool those of the 11 and
I2 years age groups showed differences of
average marks which amounted to more than
three times the differences of the probable
errors, while those of the 13 and 14 years
age groups did not ; in the case of the AngloChinese children, the difference in any of the
age groups did not amount to three times the
probable error.

It should be noted that, wherever differences of average marks are mentioned, the
reader is not to understand that the differences quoted are necessarily equal to three
times the probable error, unless specifically
stated. According to the usual convention,
unless a difference is equal to three times its

ITI

probable error, it is regarded as “‘ statistically
insignificant.”” Nevertheless, any difference
which is larger than the probable error may
have some slight suggestive value, even if
not statistically significant in the conventional sense.

The Mental Ratio of Anglo-Chinese Children
as Shown tin the Northumberland Test

As the number of half-caste children in the
separate age groups is so small, it will be
better to compare the mental ratios (I.Q.s)
of the two groups as a whole. These can be
calculated from the norms published by
Professor Burt. It appears that the I.Q. of
the London half-castes is 102-71 and that of
the Liverpool half-castes 99-44.

Differences Obtained with the Opposites Test

In this test (see Table III), which is Test 2
of the Northumberland Tests, the marks
obtained by the English children in London
are slightly higher than those of the AngloChinese, except at 9, where there was no
appreciable difference. In Liverpool the
marks of the Anglo-Chinese at 8 and Io years
of age were better than those of the English
children ; at 9 years of age, however, those
of the English children were higher.

The same fact is again evident—namely,
that the Liverpool children, both English
and Anglo-Chinese, are slower in this test
than the London children. The average
differences of the English children showed
high statistical significance (about 7 or 8
times the probable error).

Differences obtained with the Perceptual Tests

In London the results (see Table IV) show
that Anglo-Chinese children of 11, 12 and 14
years obtained higher marks than English
children of corresponding ages; English
children of 13 years, however, proved better
than Anglo-Chinese of the same age group.
The surprisingly low mark of the AngloChinese, which is even lower than that obtained by children one year younger, is
probably a mere consequence of sampling—
due to the smaller number of children of this
age obtainable for testing.

In Liverpool the Anglo-Chinese children of

II, 12 and 13, all obtained higher average
marks than English children of like ages.
The only difference that showed any statistical significance was that of Liverpool children at the age of 12.

In comparing the results of the two cities
thus obtained, we find that the figures of the
first three age groups (II, 12 and I3 years)
are highly reliable from a statistical point of
view, while the fourth (14 years of age) is not.
These show that English children in London
are definitely superior at 11 and 12 years,
though not, apparently, at 13 years. At this
age the Liverpool children are better. As

for the last group, the result indicates a
possible superiority—very slight no doubt—
of the Liverpool children.

Mental Ratios with Form Board Tests

This test (see Table V) differs from the
foregoing in that the recognized standard of
norms allows for sex differences. Here, too,
it must be remembered that the English
children form a selected group. Accordingly,
the separate norms for the boys and girls
were averaged when comparing half-castes
and English children. This was done in order
to make the comparison fall into line with
the system used in the other tests in which
the standard of norms are not differentiated
with regard to sex. In calculating I.0.s the
double basis (i.e. the two different sets of
norms for boys and girls) was used.

In all age groups the I.Q.s of the AngloChinese in both cities are higher than those
of the English children, with the exception
of the 8-year-old Liverpool children, who
were slightly better. The differences are
shown in Table VI.

Table VI compares the mental ratios of the
Anglo-Chinese and all the English children in
London and Liverpool respectively. Many
of the differences are statistically significant.
It should be noticed that the average I.Q.s
of all the London children (i.e. English and
Anglo-Chinese together) for the form board
test are better than those of the Liverpool
children of both races.

The Effect of Sex Difference

Although the scope of this article does not
permit of a detailed discussion on the effect

Cc

113

of sex difference, the following two points
should be noted in passing. Firstly, the
Liverpool children (both Anglo-Chinese and
English), taken as a whole, show a much
greater sex difference than the London children. The result, however, is hardly “‘ significant,”” none of the differences being equal
to three times the probable error. Secondly,
no marked sex difference is shown by the
London children in the Northumberland,
perceptual and opposites tests, but in the
form board test this difference between boys
and girls is well marked.

4. CORRELATIONS

As already mentioned, children between
8 and 10 years of age were given one group
test only, namely the opposites test, and
therefore no correlation is possible in their
case. In the other eight groups, however, i.e.
II-12, 12-13 and 13-14 years, three kinds of
tests, namely, the Northumberland, perceptual and form board test were used ;
a double correlation was, therefore, possible,
that is, the correlations between the tests
were first calculated and then the correlations
among the four different groups (AngloChinese children and English children in
London, and Anglo-Chinese and English
children in Liverpool). The results are shown
in Table VII.

It could scarcely be necessary or possible
to demonstrate here that a single general
factor (intelligence) underlies all the tests,
particularly in their three different forms ;
but the results are certainly consistent with
this view. At the same time, more limited or
specific factors seem to be operative as well.
For example, the perceptual tests did not
correlate so highly with the verbal tests as
the verbal tests did with each other, or as the
perceptual tests did among themselves. This
also applies to the form board tests. This is
consistent with the familiar view that there
is a specific verbal factor, and possibly a
perceptual factor, and perhaps even a distinct eye-and-hand co-ordination factor.

Adverse criticism might suggest that verbal group testing is not so satisfactory as testing each individual child, and further that
the verbal tests, being in English, may be

harder for the Anglo-Chinese than for the
native English. This last objection can be
easily set aside, since for the Anglo-Chinese
children here tested there was no language
difficulty whatsoever. It must also be
remembered that many of the children to
whom group tests were given were also tested
individually, and the results of the two types
of tests confirmed each other.

Above all, it would seem from the correlations that the different types of tests give
similar results and are really measuring the
same thing both for the English on the one
hand and for the Anglo-Chinese on the other.
According to the correlations between the
three groups of tests calculated, it appears
that a difference of race did not affect the
relations between the tests any more than a
difference of town.

The probable errors were calculated separately for each coefficient of correlation, but
it will be sufficient here to note only the highest and the lowest. The probable errors
ranged from 0-065 for the lowest correlations
to 0°044 for the higher correlations.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The main outcome of the results detailed
above may be thus summed up.

1. In the Northumberland, perceptual
and form board tests, the Anglo-Chinese
children on the whole excel the English.

2. In the opposites test, English children,
from 8-10 years of age, are slightly better
than half-caste children.

3. Generally speaking, London children,
both English and half-caste, appear mentally
superior to Liverpool children of both races.

6. SUGGESTED EXPLANATION OF RESULTS

A glance at the above conclusions indicates
that an attempt should be made to answer
two fundamental questions: (1) Why are
the mental abilities of Anglo-Chinese children
superior to the English children? (2) Why
are the London children superior to the Liverpool children ?

In regard to the first question the following
tentative suggestions may be offered.

1. The Economic Factor—tIn the first
place it appears that, although both English
A STUDY OF INTELLIGENCE OF ANGLO-CHINESE CHILDREN

and Chinese homes are obviously poor, the
latter are as a rule not quite as poor as those
of the typical English families of the district.

This is largely due to the fact that the
Chinese workman is rather more easily satisfied than the English workman, who often
refuses simple work which is ill-paid because
he fancies he deserves something better.
Apart from this, the Chinese workman, being
most usually employed by his fellow countrymen, there tends to be more co-operation
between employer and employee than is the
case with English labourers and the Chinese
employee is but rarely involved in trade
union strikes. Although it cannot be claimed
that the economic factor is directly responsible for inherent intelligence, it is only
reasonable to assume that the whole course
of intellectual development is not completely unaffected by it.

If this be so, although it is impossible to
point to the superior economic condition of
the Anglo-Chinese families as a concrete
reason for their intellectual superiority, it
should be borne in mind that the half-caste
children are favoured by this initial advantage.

2. Racial Tradition and Heredity—The
Anglo-Chinese children certainly owe some
characteristics in their mental make-up to
their fathers, who come from a people who
represent an older civilization, and whom
public opinion, if nothing else, has taught to
value learning and culture.

3. Possible Influence of Home Environment.—The home environment of the AngloChinese children is generally more conducive
to educational achievement than that of the
typical East End child. Employment of
spare time has an important bearing on this
point. Two subsidiary advantages which
favour the Anglo-Chinese are :

(a) Their parents, who are frequently shopkeepers, being at home most of the day, have
every opportunity of directing the sparetime activities of their children, such as encouraging them to read in the evening, etc.

(5) The parents of the English children of
the East End are very often dock-labourers
and factory hands, whose taste in the employment of spare time is usually—although it

II5

would be rash to make too sweeping a
generalization—in athletics, the cinema and
watching boxing, football, or cricket matches.
The children learn from their parents to
interest themselves in athletics to a much
greater degree than do the Anglo-Chinese,
whose fathers are as a rule uninterested in
such matters and consequently influence
their children in the direction of quieter
pursuits. |

4. The Indirect E ffect of Race Prejudice.—
The children of mixed marriages are raised in
a home environment which is more or less
aware of race prejudice. This vague feeling of
race prejudice may perhaps be scarcely clear
or conscious ; but it is manifest in a certain
race sensitiveness in the children, and a desire
on their part to prove to their English classmates that they are in no way inferior. In
other words, they have a feeling of being on
trial; and one of the obvious ways of justifying themselves in the eyes of their fellow
scholars and of their teachers is to concentrate on achieving success in school attainments. It is significant, in this connection,
that all elementary school teachers with
whom this question was discussed were
unanimously of the opinion that the AngloChinese children are, as a whole, extremely
amenable to discipline, and that they show
particular application to their lessons.

It now remains to consider the second
question. Why are the London children
superior to those of Liverpool? The differencemay be largely explained byenvironment.
The school organization, the class-room instruction, and the cultural influences outside
the school are undoubtedly superior in the
main in London.

The differences in the standards and facilities for education were noticeable even to a
casual observer. In Liverpool it appeared
that the schools were not so amply staffed as
those in London. For example, it was frequently observed that in Liverpool a single
teacher was required to take two classes at
the same time, a procedure which certainly
does not occur in the L.C.C. schools. Apart
from this, it appears that the general
standard required of the London teachers
116

themselves is somewhat higher than that of
Liverpool. It is thus obvious that, when the
educational environments are so dissimilar,
the actual standard of the educational
achievements will likewise vary considerably.

The innate difference in intelligence, if it
exists, would be a little harder to explain.
One might, however, suppose that in the
main the more intelligent of whatever race
would tend to gravitate and to hold their own
in the capital. Since living is cheaper in
Liverpool, and since the standard of comfort
is lower, one would naturally get there lower
representatives both of English and of foreign
populations than in the metropolis.

In conclusion, the fact that really there are
no very significant differences in regard to
intelligence must be repeated and empha

sized. The mere fact that a little group of
Anglo-Chinese children on the whole excels a
little group of English children in certain
selected tests does not of itself mean very
much, and the main result of the present
research can do no more than suggest, what
the psychologist previously suspected but
may possibly come as a surprise to the social
worker and to the plain man, that the difference between the two races is after all
extremely small.
