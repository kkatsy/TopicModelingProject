FERTILITY AND ECONOMIC STATUS IN
LONDON"

By D. V. GLASS.

changes in fertility in England and Wales

since 1851, gross and net reproduction
rates were computed by applying the specific
fertility rates of other countries to the female
populations in the different parts of England
and Wales. Tests of this method show that
in practice the error involved is not more than
6 per cent., so that the substitute rates are
sufficiently accurate for most of the needs of
demographic analysis.

On the basis of these gross and net reproduction rates, it was decided to attempt an
analysis of differential fertility. But the
census material available does not permit the
construction of gross reproduction rates for
the economic or social classes of the country,
because no analysis of status is given for
women who are unmarried but not gainfully
employed. Since, therefore, the classes could
not be separated either for the whole country
or for its component parts, it was decided to
follow the method of Heron{ and compare
gross and net reproduction rates in the various administrative divisions of London with
factors which would act as indices of the
social or economic class of these divisions.
In his study Heron compared fertility (defined as the number of legitimate births per
100 wives aged 20 and upwards in 1851, and
as the number of legitimate births per roo
wives aged 15 to 54 in 1901) with nine separate factors which he regarded as being indicative of poverty or prosperity.

Social Status,’’ Drapers’ Company Research Memoirs,

In recent months Mitra* and Martin} have

-continued Heron’s work and brought it up

to date. Mitra follows Heron rather closely
in order to obtain a comparable series of
correlation coefficients. Martin, however,
goes considerably further. In addition to a
series of individual indices he uses a social
class index of the Metropolitan Boroughs,
obtained by placing the Registrar-General’s
five classes for the whole of London on a
normal scale, finding the mean of each social
class on this scale, multiplying the numbers
in the social classes in each borough by these
mean values, summing them and. then
dividing by the total males in the five classes.
But apart from the justification of putting
this type of social phenomenon on a normal
scale, Martin’s method does not allow the
comparison of fertility and social status over
any significant length of time. Up to the
present the Registrar-General’s social classes
are available only for the 192r census, and
the assumption, implicitly made by Martin
for the purpose of one of his analyses,
that the social classes of the various Metropolitan Boroughs remained unchanged between IgII and 1931, is probably unjustified.

To obtain a series of approximately comparable class indices for a number of the
censuses since 1851, it is evident that one
must fall back on occupational and other
factors which can be obtained at each census.
In order to avoid begging the question as to
what constitutes social class, it was decided to
choose factors indicative of high or low
economic status, so that the resultant index
should be as nearly as possible a purely
economic one. As it was desired to have
indices which were all suggestive of the

height of economic status rather than of the
reverse, factors which showed the proportion
of low status employment were turned upside
down. The factors chosen were :

1. The number of males engaged in professional occupations per I00 occupied
males.

2. The number of occupied males per 100
males employed in occupations indicative of low status areas.*

3. The number of female domestic servants per 100 total population excluding
domestic servants. t

4. The percentage of the total population
living less than two in a room.}

Variations in the type of census information
available prevents complete comparability—
in particular the age groupings of the occupied population differs between censuses§—
but it is possible to obtain fair comparability
with the four indices described above for the
censuses of 1901 to 1931 ; while if the undercrowding index is omitted it is possible to
include the 1851 census in the comparison.
The factors were combined on the lines of an
unweighted price index. For each factor the
proportions in the individual boroughs (or
Registration Districts in 1851) were turned
into indices by using the corresponding proportion for London as a whole as the base,
the indices being then added and a simple
average taken. The resultant figure suffers
from a number of defects, but appears to be
fairly reasonable as an indication of the
relative social status of the various boroughs
at each census. No attempt was made to
compare changes in economic class over a
period of time, so the problem of discounting
apparent class changes by the structural

change occurring in the country as a whole
over the same periods did not arise.

Tables I and IT show the gross reproduction
rates computed at the various censuses, an
average of the births for the three years
centring on each census being used. The
Registrar-General’s Annual Review for 1900
to 1902 did not give the customary separation
of births into males and females, so that for
Igor it was only possible to compute total
specific fertility rates. These differ from gross
reproduction rates merely by the proportion
of female to total live births, so that their
substitution is unlikely to influence seriously
the value of any correlation to be found between fertility and status. (At the previous
census the sex ratio varied by only 4 per cent.

between the districts of London.) But it
should, of course, be borne in mind as a
possible qualification of the results for gor.
More serious, however, is the fact that whereas the required economic information for
Igo was given for the Metropolitan Boroughs, the vital statistics for 1900 to 1902
were given for Registration Districts and
Sub-Districts. From these districts it was
possible accurately to construct 22 Metropolitan Boroughs, instead of the 28 (excluding the City) for which vital statistics were
subsequently available. For this reason the
figures for I9g01 are not included as an essential part of the present paper, though they
are referred to later. Table III shows the
values of the combinations of factors used
in constructing the class index. The figures

in Table IV below show that the status index
—whether measured on the basis of three or
four factors—gives a wide range of dispersion
and therefore differentiates markedly between the position of the various boroughs
and districts of London.

Taking all the Registration Districts of
London in 1851 (excluding the City area—
that is, City, East London and West London)
and all the Metropolitan Boroughs for 1911
to 1931 (excluding the City), the correlation
coefficients were obtained which are set out
in Table V.

It will be noticed that these coefficients are
all extremely high, and that they exhibit no
consistent trend. Further, the inclusion of
the index of overcrowding does not significantly alter the picture—it merely adds a

slight intensification. It is also interesting to
note that the coefficient for 1851 differs from
that of 1911 by an amount just under the
average of the standard deviations of the two
coefficients. When, in addition, it is remembered that registration was defective in 1851,
and that the deficiency, according to the
observations of contemporary registrars, was

* Throughout this paper the correlation coefficient
is given with its standard deviation. The standard
error is 0-177 with 33 items; 0-192 with 28; 0-224
with 21; and 0-229 with 20. All the correlations cited
are thus well above the threshold of significance.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

probably greatest as regards illegitimate
births, it is highly probable that the real correlation for 1851 on the above basis should not
be less than that for 1911. This would support Professor R. A. Fisher’s suggestion that
the absence of class differentials in fertility
in the middle of the nineteenth century is
very doubtful.

- But the coefficients given in Table V cannot be accepted without query. In the first
place, the birth statistics of some of the
London boroughs are no indication of the
fertility of the people in those boroughs.
Holborn and Paddington, for example, consist to a very appreciable extent of a transient
boarding-house and hotel population. Secondly, the gross reproduction rates are very
strongly affected by the proportion of unmarried women in the basic populations, particularly as in this country illegitimacy is at
a relatively low level. Consequently, in those
districts where there are large numbers of
domestic servants in proportion to the total
population, the gross reproduction rates are
found to be low, and this may automatically
exaggerate the inverse relationship between
fertility and status.

The difficulty is to decide whether or not
these low gross reproduction rates are spurious. If the women who take up domestic
service continue in this field throughout their
active life and are therefore prevented from
marrying or, if they marry, from having
children, then the low rates are genuine. But
if domestic service is merely a temporary
occupation for the bulk of the women—
something to give them a living while they
are waiting for marriage—then the low rates
are quite false. It is'evident that some test
of the situation is necessary, and it was therefore decided to exclude a number of boroughs
which appeared abnormal for one or other of
the reasons mentioned above. The main factor influencing the exclusion of boroughs was
the existence of an abnormally high percentage of unmarried women between the
ages of 20 and 45 years—abnormal, that is,
in relation to the general run of the proportions for the various sections of London.
Taking this factor together with what is
known from census and survey material
FERTILITY AND ECONOMIC STATUS IN LONDON

about the make-up of the different boroughs

and districts, the following were excluded

(the City had already been excluded in the

previous analysis) :

Holborn, Clerkenwell, St. Luke, St.
James’ (Westminster), Marylebone,
Hampstead, Lewisham.

IgiI, 1921 and 1931: Chelsea, Hampstead,
Holborn, Kensington, Paddington,
Marylebone, Westminster.

This left twenty Registration Districts for
1851 and twenty-one Metropolitan Boroughs
for 191 to 1931, and the indices of status for
these areas were then correlated with the
corresponding gross reproduction rates. The
results are shown in Table VI.

It will be seen that the coefficients are still
extremely high, even though that for 1851 is
significantly lower than in the correlation
based on unselected districts. The difference
between the two coefficients for 1851 may,
however, be due largely to the fact that the
present writer knows less about the make-up
of London districts in 1851 than he does of
London boroughs to-day. The general appearance of the coefficients for the period
IgII to 1931 suggests a decrease in the
strength of the inverse relationship between
fertility and status; but as the difference
between the highest and lowest coefficients in
each of the above series is less than the
average of their standard deviations, it
would be unjustifiable to press this conclusion. The most evident conclusion to be
drawn from the coefficients for unselected
and selected areas is that the inverse relationship did not change in any fundamental way

IZ1

in the period surveyed. The correlation for
Ig0I, based on eighteen boroughs, is
—0:944+0:026 with the three-factor index
of status and —o-869 +0-058 with the fourfactor index, so that the situation as viewed
either by these coefficients* or by the four
sets of coefficients for 1911 does not agree
with Dr. Heron’s conclusion that the intensity of the fertility-status relationship
doubled between the middle of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth
century.

Gross reproduction rates are indices of fertility only, and in discussing the question of
differential fertility it is clear that we are
equally, if not more, interested in the net
replacement resulting from the combined
forces of fertility and mortality. For this
reason female Life Tables were constructed
for the twenty-one selected Metropolitan
Boroughs in r191I and 1931,f and used for
computing net reproduction rates from the
previous gross reproduction rates (see Table
VII). Incidentally, and as a check on the
validity of the method of comparing the
economic status of the different boroughs,
correlations were computed between the
status indices and the number of years lived
by females in the stationary population between the ages of 15 and 50. The coefficients
were +0-842-++0:064 in 1911, and —0-785
+0:084in 1931, which would seem to indicate
that the indices of status have a real significance. Since there is a negative correlation between mortality and status as well as
between fertility and status, it would be
expected that the use of net reproduction
rates as fertility indices would lower the correlation coefficients. The decrease could not,
however, be great, as the number of years
lived by females in a stationary population
between the ages of 15 and 50 showed a

* A correlation was also calculated for 1871 (selected
districts only), though for this year only a two-factor
index of status was possible (based on professional and
on low status occupations). The coefficient was
— 0°709 + O°II7.

¢ The question of transferable births and deaths
complicates the position in 1851, and no Life Tables
were constructed for that year. The 1911 Life Tables
were based on the deaths of 1911-12 (1910 deaths were
omitted for lack of requisite data), and those for
1931 used the deaths of 1930-2.

coefficient of variation of only 6-65 per cent.
in Ig1I and 1-95 per cent. in 1931. In fact,
the coefficients of correlation between net
replacement and status in the selected
boroughs were —0-949+0°022 in I91I and
—0'905 +0:'039 in 1931. The 1931 coefficient is slightly lower than the corresponding
one derived by using gross reproduction
rates, but that for Ig1I is actually higher
than its gross reproduction counterpart.
This, together with an examination of the
fertility and status indices for the boroughs,
suggests a possible curvilinear distribution of
fertility, which may have been straightened
out by the introduction of the mortality
factor in 1911. This was tested by correlating
the logarithms of both fertility and status
indices, which produced the following coefficients: (a) gross reproduction rates and
status, —0:967 +0-014 in 1911, and —0-924
+0°032 in 1931, and (}) net reproduction
rates and status, —o-963+0-016 in IQII,
and —o-916+0°-035 in 1931.

It has been shown that, so far as the intensity of the relationship between fertility
and status is concerned, there have been no
fundamental changes since 1851. All the
correlations show some tendency for an intensification between 1851 and Ig1I, and

those for the selected boroughs and districts
also show signs of a dissipation between Ig1I
and 1931. But the absolute changes are so
slight as to be without real significance.
However, the question of trends in differential fertility is not settled by this answer, for
clearly it is possible to maintain the same
intensity in a relationship between factors
while the range covered by one of the factors
falls considerably. The correlation would be
perfect if fertility fell by 50 per cent. in
moving from a status of 100 to one of 150, or
if it only fell by 5 per cent. with the same
change in status, provided only that the
change in fertility were finite and consistent
in relation to the change in status. Some
indication that this trend is true of differential fertility in London is seen by comparing
the coefficients of variation of the fertility
rates with those of the indices of status for
the different years (see Table VIII).

From Table VIII it is clear that between
1851 and 1911 the coefficient of variation of
fertility increased much more than that of
status, while between 1911 and 1931 the range
of fertility has fallen in relation to the range
of status. This would suggest that a unit
change in status would be accompanied by a
greater change in fertility in I91r than in
either 1851 or 1931, implying a reversal of
FERTILITY AND ECONOMIC STATUS IN LONDON

trends after 1911. The question of the
deficiency of birth registration in 1851 prevents an unquestioned acceptance of the
apparent trend between 1851 and IoII,
though this is given some support by an
analysis of the fertility of the counties of
England and Wales over the same period.*
But between 1911 and 1931, for which dates
the results may be taken as reasonably reliable, the change of trend is probably significant. This conclusion is supported by the
trend of fertility in the individual boroughs
between I91I and 1931. Correlations between the level of fertility in I91I and the
percentage fall in fertility between 1911 and
1931 yield coefficients of +-0-801 +0-068 for
all boroughs (excluding the City only), and
+0o-858+0-058 for the selected boroughs,
thus showing a marked tendency for all districts to fall to the same low level of fertility
in spite of the fact that differences in the
range of economic status between 1911 and
1931 were very small.

The results may be shown in a slightly

different way by using the regressions of the
correlations. By expressing these for fertility
in terms of status, and calculating for each
regression the rise in fertility accompanying a
fall in status from 150 to 100, the data set out
in Table IX were obtained.
