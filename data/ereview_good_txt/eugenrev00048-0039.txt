RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
INTELLIGENCE OF TECHNICAL college

students and size of family
By F. W. WARBURTON and E. C. VENABLES

IMMELWEIT! found a significant
HH eezestn of —-133 between size of

family and composite score in four
verbal and non-verbal tests of intelligence
for 408 students at the London School of
Economics. Leybourne - White?3 at
Manchester University obtained correlations
of r = +-025 between the untimed versions
of the 1938 Matrices non-verbal test and size
of family (862 students) and r = —-073
between the Moray House Adult 2 test and
size of family (700 students). Venables‘ of
the School of Education, Manchester University, found an r of —-051 between size of
family and the 1947 version of the Matrices
test for 481 technical college students, and
Wilcockson‘ of the Department of Education,
Manchester University, obtained an r of
—:041 between size of family and the
untimed version of the 1938 Matrices test.
The latter four correlations are nonsignificant.

Venables has recently extended her sample

of technical college students to 1,004. The
correlation between size of family and the
1947 Matrices test for this group is —-0173,
which is non-significant, i.e. effectively zero.
Mean test scores are:
