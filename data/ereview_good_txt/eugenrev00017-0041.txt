SOME ASPECTS

Confucian Times to A.D. 221

ATA RELATING TO the earliest periods

of China’s population are very sketchy,

but a population of 15 to 18 million
may be inferred in Confucian times. From the
third century B.C. to the establishment of the
Han empire (205 B.c. to A.D. 211) China was
torn by civil wars, banditry and prolonged
disorder so that by the time Kao Ti, the founder
of the Han empire, gained power, the population
had been halved.

After the Hans established peace in China the
population was registered more efficiently.
Durand? has analysed the data available and
his amended figures are reproduced in Table I

A.D. 221-995

The Han dynasty was followed by 400 years of
chaos and anarchy with no central authority to
exercise control over the component units. This
greatly reduced the population and the available
evidence suggests one of about 25 million at
the close of the fifth century A.D. For the Sui
dynasty Durand gives an amended figure of
54 million in round numbers.

The Tang dynasty came into power in A.D.
618 and ruled over China for 300 years. Flood
control, peace and prosperity characterized the

period and the population which had fallen to
37,140,000 again started inching up so that by
A.D. 755 it was in the neighbourhood of 53
million, though Taylor! puts the population at
65 million for the year A.D. 750.

Between A.D. 705 and 755 the census
machinery functioned more smoothly and the
apparent population increase during this period
may be attributed as much to the improvement
in the registration system as to the peace and
order which then prevailed. But after 755 the
census machinery again cracked under the
impact of recurrent revolts and dissentions
which were always suppressed by force. Many
historians believe that 36 million lives were then
lost and the population was reduced to
16,900,000. 2

A.D. 996-1103

Resurgence of the Chinese life and culture came
under the Sungs. Flood control and encouragement of agricultural settlement gave a fillip to
the growth of population. With regard to the
Sung period, Durand? gives two series of
estimates, one of which is based on original
sources and recorded data and the other on data
inferred by him on the basis of certain assumptions. Both series are presented in Table 2.

The reasons for the wide disparity between
the two sets of figures here reproduced are
that the data based on original sources was
presumably arrived at by multiplying the number
of households with the average number of
persons per household. But Sung statistics are
unique in showing such a small average of

individuals per household (2-0 to 2:3). Thus it is
plausible that the Sung statistics were limited
to males.? But even if all males were enumerated
and the number doubled to cover the females,
the resultant average number of persons per
household is still incredibly low. Durand therefore worked out the amended figures given
above.

A.D. 1103-1380

Early in the twelfth century Manchuria gained
control of the whole Yellow River basin. The
Sung retired to the south and continued to rule
there until, during the thirteenth century, first
the Chin and later the Sung succumbed to the
Mongol power. Some of the recorded statistics
for this period are given in Table 3.

1223 28,320,085 1195 48,490,400

The figures for the Southern Sung were
derived by multiplying the number of households
by their average size (2:3); the average family
size of the Chins was 6:5.

In the early thirteenth century the Chin
empire succumbed to Ghengis Khan and by
1280 his grandson Kublai Khan had conquered
the Sung territory and become the sole master
of the whole of China. The population under
Mongol rule is shown by five censuses; the
results are given in Table 4.

*Cressey, in Asia’s Lands and Peoples believes the
population to have been 61 million in 1578.

The population of 60 million recorded in
1381 was almost the same as in the Mongol
period. This static level of population may be
attributed to the incessant fighting and general
privation of the last days of Mongol rule and,
especially, pandemic bubonic plague, but Ho?
attributes it to the important gaps in earlier
Ming enumerations; he believes that the
population during the late fourteenth century
probably exceeded 65 million.

A.D. 1661-1739

In the early days of the T’sing dynasty only
males of military age were registered.1 The
recorded and estimated figures for this period
are given in Table 6.

After Ming and T’sing came Ching—the forerunner of the Manchu who ruled until 1910
when the last Manchu emperor abdicated to
make way for the establishment of the Republican Government. But estimates from the Ching
census figures are too vague for inclusion here.

A.D. 1740-1884

For the period following 1734 a couple of
population estimates are reported by Cressey:*
1740—140 million, 1812—362 million. Mulhill
Dictionary of Statistics gives a population of
125,046,000 for the year 1740, but adds that it
applied to only a part of China.

The population for the period 1749 to 1885
as returned in various censuses, together with
the estimates of Abbot,’ Durand? and Mulhill
are shown in Table 7.

Conditions affecting Population Growth, 17401884

The population of China reached its peak about
1850, having increased steadily for over a
hundred years. But then came a series of natural
and man-made catastrophies: some nineteenth
century Western observers put the total loss of
population during and after the Taiping
Rebellion at 20 to 30 million. Mass hunger and
starvation accounted for 9 to 13 million deaths
in Shansi province alone in the Great Famine
of 1877-78. The province had a registered
population of over 15 million in 1850, but only
14,314,485 in 1953 at the first Communist census.

A.D. 1885-1949

Dr. Ho® writes “The century between 1851 and
1949, despite the availability of various figures,
is practically a “demographer’s vacuum’”’. The
most notable estimate is the one made by Buck;
from his studies of the rural population of
China it would appear that the total may touch

IN MAINLAND CHINA

600 million. While his surveys provide no actual
census totals, he shows an average farm population of 1,485 persons per square mile of the
340,000 square miles of cultivated land in the
twenty-two provinces studied, giving 504,900,000
people in this rural area alone, to which must
be added the population of the north-eastern
provinces. It should be noted that a number of
other estimates have been made for this period;
they reveal so many inconsistencies and contradictions that they carry us nowhere. By far
the best series for the period 1931-49 is one
made by Spencer®—best in the sense that if
carried forward beyond 1949 to the year 1953
it leads up to the census figure of 582,555,000.
Table 8 is based on Spencer’s estimates.

1950-1952

No less than five official estimates have been
given out by various authorities between the
establishment of the Communist government
in October 1949 and the census of 1953; they
range from 483 million to 567-7 million.

Conditions affecting Population Growth, 18001953

This period was marked by the disintegration
and weakening of the Central government. The
“Opium War” (1839-42) proved that it could
no longer face even a small army well equipped
with European arms. The Taiping Rebellion
(1848-64) and the resultant famines and epidemics were responsible for the loss of some 50
million lives. The war with Japan (1894-95) was
followed by a series of famines. The Famine of
1920-21 rendered 20 million northern peasants
destitute and killed half a million. The Great
Famine of 1928 killed another 3 million in
Shensi alone. The Yangtze flood of 1931
affected 12 million people, while that of 1935
dislodged 14 million from their ancestral
hearths. The county of Han-ch’uan (Hupei) saw

31
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

220,000 of its population of 290,000 carried
away by the flood. In 1931 Japan occupied
Manchukuo and the great invasion by Japan
in 1937 killed tens of millions of Chinese,
apart from disrupting agriculture. Nationalist
forces under Chiang Kai-shek broke the dike
of the Yellow River in July 1938 at two places
in Honan, in order to halt the advance of the
Japanese army and it was not until March 1947
that the river was diverted to its original course.
The Communists came to power in 1949, and
in 1951 Lo Jui-ch’ing, Minister of Public Security,
claimed that his organization had “‘liquidated
15 million counter-revolutionaries”’ and a large
number were drafted to concentration camps.
In 1952, Po I-p’o, the Minister for Finance,
publicly boasted that the People’s Government
had liquidated 2 million “bandits” in the preceding three years. A distressing wave of suicides
in 1951-53 took another toll of human life and
is indicative of the social upheavals which
plagued the period. These conditions tempted
exodus into Hong Kong and Macao, totalling
more than a million emigrants for the last
decade. In 1950-53 the Korean War caused
another drain on the Chinese population and
also affected the birth rate adversely by the
mobilization of millions of young men.

Census: 1953

The results of the 1953 Census were made
known on November Ist, 1954. The final figures
differ slightly from those released earlier by
Teng Hsiao-p’ing on June 19th, 1954. The two
sets of figures are compared in Table 9.

The accuracy check of this population count is
reported to have shown a net omission of just
over 0-1 per cent, though some believe the net
under-enumeration to be of the order of 3 to 5
per cent.’, °.

Males constitute 51-82 per cent (297,553,510)
and females 48-18 per cent (276,652,422). Of
the total population of 574,206,440 directly
enumerated, infants and toddlers (0 to four years
of age) make 15-6 per cent, children of five to
nine years 11 per cent and children of ten to
seventeen years 14-5 per cent. Thus, the total
juvenile population up to seventeen years of
age is 41-1 per cent of the total and is indicative
of the high birth rate operative in the country.

32

Only 58-9 per cent or 338,339,892 were aged
eighteen and above. This was the primary classification for the purpose of adult franchise.

Barring some limited information on a few
broad age and sex groups, no official release of
the complete picture of the age structure of the
population has been made known to the
demographers of the world outside China.
However the U.N. Secretariat® and the United
States Bureau of Census? and, more recently,
Orleans!! on behalf of the National Science
Foundation, America, have worked out the age
structure of the population. By far the best
estimate, and one which should form the basis
of further research in Sino-demography, is that
presented by Orleans.

An Appraisal of the Census, 1953
If taken at face value, the 1953 census shows
that the population of mainland China in that
year was 100 million larger than Premier Chou
En-lai himself believed it to be in 1950 when he
said “‘According to the most trustworthy investigation, the population of liberated China
totals 487,690,000. 12

It is not known what methods were employed
to give figures for the period 1949 and 1953
during which a series of population estimates
for the mainland were dished out by the Communist authorities. In all probability these
figures were based on the trend of natural
POPULATION GROWTH

increase of population in the past taking a
population of 450 or 400 million as the starting
point—an assumption which the 1953 Census
refuted. The figure for 1953 may, therefore, be
comparatively reliable because of the direct
enumeration. But on the other hand Professor
Ta Chen? from Mainland China criticized the
census of 1953 as “‘unscientific’’ and the results
as “dubious” at the meeting held at the Office
of the State Statistical Bureau, and Lin Nai Jui!
suspected that it was “‘more a political stratagem,
skilfully presented under the cloak of statistical
authenticity than a faithful submission of well
ascertained facts.” Cressey* considers China’s
population to be in the neighbourhood of 500
million rather than the 600 million that the
Communists would like to make him believe.

The post-census estimates given by various
Communist authorities contradict one another
to an extent which forces one to suppose that
the Chinese authorities themselves have only a
foggy notion of how many people live in
mainland China. By way of illustration, Table 10
is prepared from different Chinese sources for
the year 1956:

1957.
603,230,000 616,500,000 627,800,000 626,000,000

There are thus four figures which range all the
way from 603 million to 627 million for the
year 1956.

Current Rate of Natural Increase

Official data published by the Chinese authorities
indicate that during 1952-57 the total population
increased by 11 per cent or some 65 million.
This gives the annual increase as 2:2 per cent
which means that China’s population was increasing during the period of the First FiveYear Plan by about 13 million persons annually.
If the present trends continue, China will have a

is 810 million in ten years and 930 million in fifteen
years. Quoted by Walker in Continuing Struggle.

IN MAINLAND CHINA

population of a thousand million in the 1980s.
But before this actually happens, Peking may
decide to take more active steps than it has done
to date to reduce China’s fertility; and if it does
so, it conceivably might achieve a greater success
in population planning than is generally possible
for democratic nations.

Factors affecting the Rate of Population Growth
in the Post-Census Era

At the current rate of growth, the Chinese are
increasing by 16 million per annum. What
worries the demographers is not the rate of
increase (2 per cent prevails in many other
countries) but that the very large base of China’s
population yields an annual addition equivalent
to the population of many countries bracketed
together. Some of the contributory factors are:

1. Internal peace which had been lacking for the
last hundred years was restored to the mainland
by the Communist government.

2. Improved sanitation and health measures have
contributed to a declining death rate while the
birth rate probably continues close to the
biological maximum. Absence of widespread
famine is another contributing factor.

3. The carefully fostered psychological atmosphere
in the community. Chandrasekhar™ observes:
“Everyone I met assured me that China was
not over-populated but actually under-populated. Heads of all kinds of institutes lamented
the existing ‘labour shortage’... People’s
China would demonstrate to the world that a
rising population and rising levels of living
need not be incompatible in an under-developed
country. What is needed is more production
and better distribution.”

These factors, combined with an improvement
in the food situation and flood control measures
have all resulted in a rate of increase which,
according to a Shanghai publication* ‘“‘has
reached a completely anarchic state.”

Conclusion

Data on the Chinese population are available
in some rudimentary form for the last 4,000
years. The simple fact is that nobody can tell
how many Chinese there have been in Mainland
China. Any figure used may include an error
of many millions. The area now comprising

33
THE EUGENICS

China has always contained various peoples,
but the only people enumerated were those over
whom the Chinese emperor was able to exert
his authority. Thus, a successful ruler could
increase his subject population at will by subjugating some additional tribes and an unsuccessful one might experience population
decrease through the revolt of various groups.
Therefore, all Chinese population data, past and
present, reflect the degree of dominance of the
central government as much as they reflected
the socio-economic and political considerations
underlying the compilation of population statistics. But one fact has always been there.
Although nobody precisely knows how many
Chinese there are and for that matter how many
Chinese there have been in the past, it is probable
that one-fourth of all the human beings on this
earth have always been the Chinese. And
granting the assumption that the current rate
of population growth will continue under the
present communist conceptions of “‘the money
value of a man,” the ratio of Chinese to the
-rest of the inhabitants of the world will continue
to rise in the foreseeable future.
