MORTALITY IN INDIA: 1901—1951°*

Introduction
NLIKE those of more advanced
countries, India’s official vital statistics are not yet complete and reliable
enough to allow of a comprehensive study of
infant mortality in all its aspects during the
last half-century. Throughout this period, the
area of registration, in the sense of regular,
albeit incomplete, returns, covers only twothirds of the geographical area and threefifths of the census population. The exigencies of public administration, the pattern of
social progress, the working of provincial
autonomy (in India public health is a
provincial subject) and the evolution of
political freedom for the country as a whole
have all conspired to make neither the area
nor the population covered a constant factor
for the registration of vital statistics during
the period under review.

From the turn of the present century, the
rough area of registration begins with what
has come to be known as Bnitish India (or
rather the old provinces) excluding the
Princely States. For some years, some
incomplete vital statistics are available for a
few of the larger and relatively progressive
Native States such as Mysore, Travancore and
Baroda, though such statistics are not always
comparable with those of British India
either in content or format. (The statistics
of British India are relatively more reliable
than those of Princely India.)
covered by these statistics continued to be
more or less the same until 1947 with the
exception of the creation in 1936 of the
two new provinces, Orissa and Sind, from
the existing British area. Thus, there was

* A paper read at a Members’ Meeting of the Eugenics
Society on October 20th, 1954. The paper is composed
of excerpts from a forthcoming book. The author is
indebted to the Nuffield Foundation for a Fellowship
which has enabled him to work on the subject in
the London School of Economics since December 1953.

The area
some continuity for British India and the
total figures were not affected till August
1947 when political power, accompanied
by the partition of the country, was completely transferred to Indian hands. By
1948 the area of registration included all
the states of the Indian Union, excluding
of course those provinces and states which
became Pakistan. The assumption that the
area of registration from 1948 embraces the
complete residual Indian . Union is only
theoretical, for in practice, the returns from
the old Native States (the modern B States)
are still largely incomplete and irregular.
With the gradual progress of the administrative integration of these States into the
political structure of the country (by merger
with an adjoining province, or a union of
several small states as a new state, or continued independent existence as a reconstituted state of the Union) the statistical
returns become a little more representative
of the total area and population of presentday India. But as this occurred towards the
end of the period of the present inquiry,
the benefit of this apparent improvement is
not reflected in this essay.

For the fifty years under review there are
no returns for the present Indian Union as a
whole, though adjustments can be made for
the old provinces of British India (excluding
the Native States) now in the Indian Union.
It must be remembered therefore that in any
discussion of Indian vital statistics there
are inevitable problems of under-registration,
inaccurate returns and want of relevant
details, so that no attempt is made here to
correct or adjust the figures of infant
mortality for the present Indian Union area
and population. This paper is therefore not
so much an essay on infant mortality in
India as on -the problems confronted in
making such a survey.
214

What is Needed :

A serious and profitable study of infant
mortality in any community or country
(and particularly in a large, heterogenous
country like India) must be based on an
adequate knowledge of the complex biological, economic and social factors affecting
the health, morbidity and mortality of
infants. We need correct and adequate
information on no less than twenty-three
points : First, the mother’s age ; the number
of children she has borne (her parity) ; order
of birth ; interval between births ; sex of the
infant ; duration of marriage ; if no marriage,
the nature of the union (illegitimacy) such
as common-law marriage, temporary concubinage or casual affair, etc. ; whether the
birth was single or multiple. Secondly and
more important, precise information is needed
on the age of the infant at death ; cause of
death ; whether the infant had _ received
any medical aid. The last two items and
even the age of the infant are often difficult
to obtain in an underdeveloped country
like India. Thirdly, we need some reliable
information on the father’s occupation ;
the family’s income ; if possible, the educational status of the mother and preferably of
both parents. As _ residential conditions
matter a great deal in any country and
particularly in India, some information on
the residence of the family, whether rural
or urban, village, town or city ; knowledge
of their religion and language will also be
useful. If the infant death was a case of
stillbirth, perinatal or neo-natal mortality
(and for all confinements for that matter)
we need information on the nature of the
confinement (normal, Caesarean, etc.) ;
whether the delivery was in the home or in a
hospital ; if at home, whether there were
any medical helpers (doctor, midwife, etc.).
Any other information of a clinical and case
history nature, besides a knowledge of the
home and upbringing, particularly of the
mothers, would be helpful.

If the study is to be a comprehensive
inquiry into all vital losses up to the age of
one year, social, medical and environmental
details from conception should be ascertained : abortion (spontaneous or induced),

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

period and the immediate cause ; premature
births (any viable infant weighing 54 Ibs.
(2,500 grammes) or less being specified as
premature or immature); stillbirths (any
infant born after the 28th week of pregnancy
who did not at any time breathe or show any
other sign of life). And for an analysis of
stillbirths a knowledge of the following
factors would be helpful : type and duration
of delivery ; primary medical cause of stillbirths; history of previous pregnancies ;
health of the mother ; nutritional assessment
of the diet during pregnancy ; mother’s
employment, if any, during pregnancy ;
history of sexual intercourse during
pregnancy.

While data on the above categories may
be considered as almost the requisite minimum, no information on most of these
factors is available for India as a whole
(undivided as well as for the present area)
or even for the former British provinces
(British India) which are usually taken as
the regular registration area in all discussions
of Indian demography.

Some incomplete data, however, are available for some provinces as to the age and
sex of the infant, rural or urban residence,
sometimes the caste and religious affiliation
of the family, and occasionally the cause of
death, but this information is given in a
majority of cases by someone such as a
parent, relative, police official or village
headman who is not medically qualified to
do so. Thus information on the cause of
infant deaths can only be taken relatively
seriously in certain cities where some effort
is made to ascertain the cause to the best of
the ability of the registration personnel. In
view of this deplorable situation, which has
not improved in recent years despite India’s
valiant efforts at progress in many directions,
a plea for a complete reorganization of the
machinery for vital registration all over
India is necessary. The formidable cost of
any such reorganization is not minimised
but there is no sense whatsoever in a government trying to fight the inordinate morbidity
and mortality of a people when the authorities
are largely ignorant of the basic causes of
sickness and death. Any worthwhile policy
SOME OBSERVATIONS ON INFANT MORTALITY IN INDIA

must be based on unquestionable facts.
But in the absence of factual data the public
health policy of the Government is no better
than the proverbial blind man searching in a
dark room for a black cat which was not
there.

Sources

Two kinds of statistical data are available
for surveying the trend of infant mortality
in India during the last fifty years: official
records and _ unofficial studies. Both,
by virtue of their content, are of limited
value.

The official sources are the series of
Reports on Sanitation and Public Health
issued by the authorities of the Government
of India. The first series are the Annual
Reports of the Sanitary Measures Taken in
India. These are principally concerned with
the protection and promotion of the health of
British and Indian troops, jails, ports and
the civilian population. These reports simply
mention total births, deaths and infant
deaths for the area under registration. The
only other detail that some of these Sanitary
Reports give is the infant mortality rate by
sex, i.e. the number of male and female infant
deaths per 1,000 male and 1,000 female live
births. The authors of these Reports
(printed in England by the order of the
House of Commons) express considerable
diffidence as to the accuracy of the figures
but a modern student of the subject is

grateful for them, such as they are, for:

although defective, they cannot be too
wide of the mark.

This series of Reports on Sanitary
Measures in India begins for the year
1864-65, as the Annual Report of the Samtary
Commissioner with the Government of Indra.
As new concepts of the role of a government
in promoting the public health of a country
began to emerge, the Government of India
appointed in 1920 a Public Health Commissioner in the place of the Sanitary Commissioner and from that year the publication
became the Annual Report of the Public
Health Commissioner with the Government
of India for the year concerned. With the

215

advent of freedom in 1947 it was decided
to integrate and centralize the medical and
public health activities of the Government
of India (a recommendation of the Bhore

-Commission on India’s health problems

in 1943). The designation of the authority
was changed to that of the Director-General
of Health Services and the volume became

the Annual Report of the Director-General

of Health Services with an accompanying
volume of statistical appendices.

There are also the comprehensive reports
of India’s decennial Censuses, the Census
Reports of India which began in 1872 and
have been issued in a more or less uniform
manner every ten years (except 1941) down
to Ig5I.

On the same lines, we have the Provincial
Reports on Public Health and Population
Census. These are the Annual Report of the
Director of Public Health and the decennial
Report of the Census for the various provinces
and states. In addition, there are the
Annual Reporis of the Executive Health
Officer for certain major cities such as
Bombay, Calcutta, Madras etc. These are
the official and unverifiable sources of
primary demographic data for India.

As distinct from these Government reports,
a few studies by individual social scientists,
government experts and medical personnel
are available. These are in the nature of
private ad hoc studies. With reference to
mortality in general and infant mortality
in particular, their scope and objectives are
very limited as they deal with random
samples of population such as a village, a
famine-affected area, patients of a particular
hospital or selected villages and towns in a
province. They refer to only limited periods
of time within the five decades under review.
Though these studies cover only select or
random samples of population, they are of
some value, for such facts as they do establish
may prove to be either corrective or corroborative of official figures. A comparison
between these two sets of official and unofficial figures, where possible, proves instructive, if the limitations of such a comparison
are not overlooked.
216

Indian Vital Statistics

If the registration of vital occurrences
is defective is it one of under-registration
or the reverse? What is the magnitude of
error ? How far are these vital rates correct °
These are difficult questions to answer.

Every student of Indian vital statistics
knows that they are defective, scanty,
scrappy and do not normally permit comparison. Evey Commission and Committee
that has inquired into various aspects of
Indian economy has emphasized this depressing lacuna and has pleaded for a reorganization of the system of vital registration.
Official reports are usually shelved as soon
as they are published, for the publication of a
report on any question in India is usyally
an excuse to postpone action indefinitely ;
the authorities often seem to feel that the
publication of a report itself is a solution to
the question ! “‘ Have we not published a
governmental Report on this question ?
What more do you want?” seems to be
the general attitude.

But the defect is usually taken to be one
of under-registration and it is further supposed that there is a greater under-registra
tion of births than of deaths. (There is no

registration of marriages at all save for a
small number of civil marriages.) Though
this assumption appears to be reasonable,
it is not always the case. ‘For instance, in
his Annual Report for 1924 the Public Health
Commissioner with the Government of India
observes, “‘ The persistent high mortality
of infants may be ascribed in part to defective
registration, not only of births but of
infant deaths, through the inclusion of stillbirths, since a distinction between the two
is not always made by the illiterate chowkidar
and police mahawar, and partly to the
tendency of the more illiterate of the population to underestimate the age of the
deceased infants.” If this were true, and
probably it is so in certain parts of the
country, the defect becomes one of over
registration, instead of the generally supposed ©

under-registration. This contention is supported by the observation of the Director
of Public Health for Central Provinces in
his Annual Report for 1934. He points out

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

that “‘ A study of death registers maintained
in urban areas leads one to conclude that
more deaths are entered under one year of
age than is actually the case. Information
given as to the age of the children, when
reporting their deaths, is usually vague,
with the result that many deaths over one
year of age are returned as under one year.
This is clearly shown by the discrepancy
usually met with between the vaccination
birth registers (which are reliable as the
date of death of the child is entered against
the birth entry) and the general death
registers. The. former invariably show a
much smaller number of deaths of infants
under one than recorded in the general
death registers.”’

Measurement of Infant Mortality

The infant mortality rate is the number
of deaths of infants under the age of twelve
months per 1,000 live births during the same
year. It is assumed that all births and deaths
are registered. Thus the infant mortality rate

is an age specific rate inasmuch as it relates

to deaths at 0-1 years of age. When it is
thus expressed as a rate per 1,000 of the
population at risk—namely of infants under
the age of one year, this is assumed as
approximately the same as the number of
live births occuring during the year. This
conventional way of expressing the infant
mortality rate would, however, be correct
if all the infants who died in a particular
year were also born in the same year. In
fact, however, infants who died _ before
completing their first year of age in IQ5I,
for instance, are the babies born in 1950
who died in 1951 before completing their
first year, and those born in 1951 who died
before the end of that year. The conventional rate will be approximately correct
if the number of births in the year before
was more or less the same as that in the
current year. But if births in the previous
year are considerably higher or lower, the
conventional infant mortality rate is apt
to be misleading and will remain at best
a crude one. Therefore, a more reliable rate
is one which is calculated as the number of
deaths under one year within a cohort of
SOME OBSERVATIONS ON INFANT MORTALITY IN INDIA

1,000 births. But on account of administrative and other difficulties of following up the
histories of babies born in a year until the
end of the following year, the official rates
follow the conventional definition and assume
that the carry-over of infant deaths from
one year to the next is equal to that of the
preceding year.

Further, any purposeful study of infant
mortality must take into consideration its
various components from the point of view
of time, beginning right from conception,
such as ante-natal mortality (death of the
foetus before the onset of labour due to
miscarriage or criminal abortion) and intrauterine mortality (death of the infant during
labour). This not only gives an idea of the
amount of mortality after conception and
before birth but also the extent of life that
could have been saved if conception had
taken place under ideal conditions. If these
two are equated with abortion, there is the
further component of stillbirths. Though
these are not strictly a part of infant
mortality, they are closely allied to it.
Then there are perinatal mortality (infant
mortality under one week), neo-natal mortality (death of the infant during the first
four weeks), mortality after the fourth week
and under one year, and the overall infant
mortality as deaths of infants under one year.
Here again, unless a country can accurately
record and carefully watch the progress of
every pregnancy, which India, like most
other countries, certainly does not do, no
serious analysis of this type can be undertaken.

The Facts: An International Comparison

For purposes of an international comparison of the levels of infant mortality, the
areas of the world which do report on infant
mortality, irrespective of the range of underregistration and the error involved (in
1950 these areas had a total population of
787 million out of an estimated total world
population of 2,400 million) can be divided
into four major groups on the basis of information available for the years between 1901
and 1952. They are: Low—those areas
with an infant mortality rate of 35 and below

217

per 1,000 live legitimate births ; Moderate—
those areas with rates between 35 and 75;
High—those areas with rates between 75
and 125; and Very High—areas with rates
above 125.

Infant Mortality Rates in Selected Countries, 1951

This apparently arbitrary division proves
rather instructive when the infant mortality
rates for several countries belonging to these
four stages, between IgoI-5 and’ 1947-52,
are examined. Table 1 sets forth the available
data for selected countries. Fifty years ago,
England and Wales, Holland and Switzerland, which were in the “ very high ”’ stage,
have progressed to the “ low ”’ stage, involving a considerable reduction in the rate of
infant mortality in the last half-century.
But countries such as Australia and New
Zealand, Sweden and Norway, which began
fifty years ago with relatively low rates, have
not registered comparable rates of progress,
for possibly the factors that contribute
directly to a reduction of infant mortality
were brought under control some decades
ago. Scotland, Canada, France and Germany,
which began this century with high rates
of infant mortality, have shown no spectacuJar decline comparable to those countries
which are to-day in the low stage, despite
their similar Western-European economies
and cultural backgrounds.

The only country in Asia found in the
“moderate ”’ stage to-day is Japan. Though
reliable figures of her position in the first
five years of the twentieth century are not
available, they must have been high and
therefore Japan’s progress in this direction
has been commendable. The two other
Asian countries which are making rapid
strides for the better are Ceylon and India,
218

Ceylon’s rate being much lower than, that of
India in 1900 as well as in 1951.

It is also noteworthy that the countries
with the lowest infant mortality rates are the
advanced Western European ones and those
with European patterns and levels of living
such as the United States, Australia, New
Zealand and Canada. These are the countries
which have more or_less low or stabilized
birth rates and where babies cannot be had
at bargain prices. The practice of contraception has led to smaller families with the
consequence that a greater premium is put
on: the life of a baby. It is true that when
more infants are born more infants will die
(Holland with a high birth rate and a low
infant mortality rate is a notable exception)
though it is possible that more infants will
survive.

(a) It is possible that comparability of these annual rates may be
adversely affected by different degrees of reliability of the population
figures used in the calculation of these mortality rates. Secondly,
there is the question of the validity of comparing the three parts of
the time series—the period before 1921 relating to a scattered and
growing area, the period 1921-46 relating to the former provinces of
British India, and the period since 1947 relating to the registration
area of the Indian Republic, that is British provinces minus Pakistan
and plus Native States.

(b) Until 1946 the registration area comprised the British provinces in
undivided India excluding the Native States.

(c) Excluding East Bengal for which area figures are not available.

(d) Partition of the country into India and Pakistan.

(e) For 1948 and subsequent years the figures are for the States
(provinces) of the Indian Union as reconstituted after partition.

Registration throughout is officially stated to be incomplete. This
is also true of the present States of the Indian Union.

Course of Infant Mortality

The above tables show India’s unenviable
position among the Asian countries and in
the world. Tables 2, 3 and 4 give the course
of infant mortality from 1go1 to the latest
available year and such details of the components of infant mortality as are available.

Table 2 deserves serious examination. It
gives the official infant mortality for the
provinces of British India, and in recent
years for the area of the Republic of India,
in annual rates and in quinquennial averages.
Two preliminary questions may be raised
about these figures: One is about their
reliability and correctness; the second is
whether they reveal any trend.

How far are these figures correct? It is
well known that the registration of both
births and deaths is incomplete and defective,
but it is believed that the registration of
births is less reliable that that of deaths.
As to the reliability of the recorded age, there
are the following three possibilities : Some
births are not registered; some infant
deaths are not registered ; when deaths are
registered the recorded age of the deceased
infant may be inaccurate.

This situation can be dealt with in many
ways: The figures may be adjusted on the

219

basis of the various decennial Census figures,
a procedure which presupposes their absolute
reliability, whereas it is known that they
are not exact and there is always the problem
of under-enumeration. Secondly, the magnitude of under-registration can be estimated.
on the basis of a sample study and the
margin of error be taken as uniformly
applicable to the entire area. Such simple
studies should have been made for every
year and for every region to check the annual
vital statistics rates and every ten years
to check the decennial Census figures, but
such corrections as these are not available.
According to the Population Data Enquiry
Committee Report, the magnitude of underregistration is estimated to be about 50 per
cent but this is nothing more than a reasoned
conjecture when considering so long a period
as half a century. In general, and theoretically, birth registration is less complete than
death registration for obvious reasons. This
is particularly true in countries where burial
is the rule and a permit for burial is issued
only after registration of death, but not so
in India, where the practice of quick cremation for an overwhelming majority of the
population is widespread. When deaths are
registered one is not sure of the exact age
of the deceased. One might expect this
error to be very minor in the case of infants
for a lapse of memory on the part of parents
or the recorders could not arise in such a
short time, but in practice the error is
significant. A study of urban mortality
statistics reveals that the information which
is given about the age of the child when
reporting the death is usually vague, with the
result that many deaths over one year of age
are returned as under one year, thus
swelling the infant mortality rate. In view
of these considerations, the official figures
are examined here as such without any
attempt at correction. If we do not set
much store by the actual figures and are
guided by only the trends revealed, we need
not be misled by the obvious inaccuracies
referred to above.

Both Table 2 and the graph show that:
a, the infant mortality rates throughout the
period have been abnormally high in relation
.220

to rates in certain selected countries in
Asia and the West, being four times as high
as those of Sweden and New Zealand ;
b, there have been three peak years (1900,

1908-9 and 1918) when the rates have been
inordinately high and, c, a declining trend is
noticeable since the 1930s.

(a) During the last fifty years the Indian
mortality rates range from 116 per 1,000
live births in 1951 to 267 in 1918; the
fluctuations have thus an enormous range. A
comparison of the Indian rates with those
of Japan and Ceylon in Asia, England and
Wales, Sweden and Holland in Europe, the
U.S.A., Australia and New Zealand even
during the earlier years of this century shows
the difficult start India has had in the matter.
She clearly began with a great handicap,
for her public health and hygiene measures
were (and are for that matter) in no way
comparable to those existing in these countries with the possible exception of Japan.
The causes for this excessive mortality must
be sought in the social, economic, cultural,
religious and health background in India.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

The diseases to which these infants apparently
succumb are discussed below in the light of
the available official information.

(6) Secondly, there are three-peak years,
1900, 1908 and 1918, when the infant
mortality rates (and mortality rates at all
ages) have been very high. Apart from what
may be termed “ ordinary causes’ from the
Indian point of view, the high rate in 1900
was due to famine in the country as a whole,
with defective nutrition leading to epidemics
and heavy loss of life. The year 1908 was
also a bad one, due to a severe malaria
epidemic over the whole of northern India.
While malaria is not always lethal in the
case of an otherwise “ healthy ’’ and normal
adult, it often proves fatal to an infant. The
highest peak in infant mortality, in 1918,
was caused by the world-wide influenza
epidemic of that year which in India claimed
some 12 to 15 million people of all ages. .

(c) Despite these peaks and variations a
declining trend is noticeable since the 1930s.
The infant mortality rate has been on the
decline since 1935 except for a slight rise in
1944 due to the severe famine in Bengal
in 1943-44 which took an estimated toll of
about 3 million people of all ages. The
infant mortality rate has been exactly halved
in the course of half a century, from 232 in
1900 to 116 in 1951. The rate in England and
Wales was reduced from 154 in 1900 to 30
in 1951. What took England and Wales
twenty years to accomplish between 1900 and
1920, took India fifty years to achieve. In
the United States of America, which is
perhaps more comparable to India in area
and a heterogenous population, the infant
mortality rate was reduced by half in about
thirty years from 99-9 in 1915 to 39-4 in 1944 ;
and it was.122 in 1900 compared to 29 in
1950. While the rate of decline in India
during the period in question has not been
impressive in comparison with that in
certain other countries, the decline has
begun and if the present plans for health
improvement, as a part of the First FiveYear Plan for raising the standard of living
are carried out, further reductions are bound
to take place.

Tables 3 and 4 reveal that in India neo-- SOME OBSERVATIONS ON INFANT MORTALITY IN INDIA

natal mortality for the twenty years 19201939 ranges between 32 and 49 per cent of
total infant mortality. In fact, except for
one year, the mean ratio has been around
47 per cent. That is, nearly 50 per cent of
infant mortality took place in the first
month. In Western countries, the marked
decline in mortality in recent decades has
taken place in the post-neo-natal period
covering the second to the twelfth month,
while the first month has shown only slight
improvement. This is also true of India
except that we do not have figures for the
last ten years to demonstrate clearly at
what age the real decline in infant mortality
set in.

On the other hand, the declining trend in
infant mortality evidenced in the official
figures may not be real. Since 1942 there
has been a national quasi-chronic food
shortage, acute regional shortages of food
which though not always as intense as the
Bengal Famine of 1943, are often near the
famine level, a lack of housing made worse
by the influx of refugees as a result of partition, and a considerable rise in the cost of
living. As a result of these conditions,
morbidity and mortality in the vulnerable
groups of the country’s population must if
anything be on the increase. Here again
there is no indisputable evidence. Is then the
decline in infant mortality rates noted in
Table 2 real-or imaginary ? An answer to
this question is important, for if the decline
is real, then the implications of such a
decline, as already pointed out, need to be
explored. If, however, the decline is illusory,
the inferential attitude of complacency on the
part of the authorities should be given up and
vigorous efforts made to effect such a decline.

Furthermore the fact that the recorded
rate of infant mortality has not risen in
spite of improved registration should not
be Jost sight of. The decline is marked in
some provinces and it is striking in the
composite state of Madras where the Director
of Public Health, in his Annual Report for
1948, points out that the decline is real:
“The steady decline in infantile mortality in
recent years in spite of the difficult food

221

situation is due to improvement in environmental hygiene, expansion of maternal and
child welfare services, health education and
raising the age of marriage.’

In the face of the only available evidence, |
it must be assumed that some decline in
infant mortality as revealed in the official
figures, must be taken to be nearer the truth.
Three recent inquiries have yielded figures
which though high when compared with those
of Western countries, are low in comparison
to earlier Indian figures.

Some Recent Surveys

There have been a few general socioeconomic or health surveys of select samples
of Indian population in recent years but none
are really ad hoc surveys dealing specifically
with infant health, morbidity and mortality.
The one ad hoc survey devoted to this subject
in Madras in the Poonamalle area under the
direction of Dr. H. M. Rajamanickam,
Deputy Directress of Public Health, has just
been completed but the report of the results
of the infant mortality survey has not yet
reached the present writer. However, three

yecent surveys which have yielded infant

mortality rates are summarized below to
give an idea of the wide range of the rates
in different areas of India.

Singhur

The All-India Institute of Public Health
and Hygiene in Calcutta conducted in 1943
a general health survey of Singhur—a nearby
rural area involving some 300 families and
307 live births. The Survey yielded an
infant mortality rate of about 137. The
Report points out, ‘‘ The sex specific infant
mortality being 196 and 85 for males and
females respectively, the former are again at a
considerable disadvantage. The _ special
reasons for higher rates amongst the former
may also help to indicate lines along which
endeavours could be made to reduce waste
in early life. From the analysis of the causes
of death so far carried out, it would appear
that a multiplicity of causes are in operation
but there are some indications of difficult
labour as being one of the possible causes
of infant mortality amongst the males.”
222

National Sample Survey.
The national sample survey, covering

roughly about 1,000 villages, fifty towns and.

four cities, was set up in 1951 under the
auspices of the Ministry of Finance of the
Government of India and the Indian Statistical Institute at Calcutta. The second round
of the national sample survey based on a
sample of all-India vuval households covering
1,106 villages taken in 1952 yielded the
infant mortality rates set out in Table 6.

The figures for infant mortality rates

given in the last column of the above table |

must be taken with considerable reserve and
caution. The national sample survey is
conducted by the interview method, and
the limitations of such a method, in Indian
conditions where the person interviewed is
under no obligation to answer, much less
to the best of his or her ability or memory,
are obvious. It is also possible that no serious
distinction was made between stillbirths and
live births. The figures in the last columns
point to the lapse of memory of couples,
about the deaths of their infants, increasing
with the interval of time.
astonishing but in villages the loss of an
adult member is probably better remembered
than the loss of an infant. There is also the
further disadvantage of confusion over the
age of the deceased infant. The death of a
fifteen-month-old infant may be recalled as
under one year. The last figure in the last
column, the infant mortality rate of 181
per 1,000 births (presumably live) for the
period of 1946-51 for rural India, is perhaps
the only figure that merits some attention.
These results are cited here only to show the
approximate range of infant mortality rates
in the last five years. The mean average
of official figures for the same five years
yields the rate of 134 per 1,000 live births.

. Mysore Survey

A general population survey of a sample of
rural and urban families in the state of
Mysore conducted in 1952 under the joint

auspices of the Government of India and

the United Nations yielded (according to a
provisional announcement at the Rome World
Population Conference) an infant mortality
rate of 168-1 per 1,000 live births for rural
(plains) and 100-9 for towns. This survey
also revealed that infant mortality rates
decreased with a rise in economic status.
This, in the sense of a real increase in income,
was reflected in better housing and in better
domestic amenities (an elementary index
adopted was the kind of lighting used,
electricity, kerosene etc.). The infant mortality rate for families in poor class housing
in urban areas was I00 per 1,000 live births
but the rate dropped to 60 when housing
conditions improved. In the rural areas
the agricultural labour families had an
infant mortality rate of 189 per 1,000
live births while the owner-cultivator
families with better incomes had a rate of
only 113. :

Infant Mortality Rates in Different Com
munities

For certain years and for some provinces
and cities infant mortality rates have been
recorded according to communities based on
caste and religion. An examination of the
available infant mortality rates for the
provinces of British India up to 1939 reveals
a very low rate for Indian Christians, high
for Muslims and highest for Hindus. This
order is maintained almost uniformly in
seven provinces for ten years prior to the
beginning of the second world war. The
Indian Christian group form a small minority
of the total population and while most of
them belong either to the lower middle or
the low income groups, they are educationally
more advanced than the Hindus. Their
fertility pattern, however, is not significantly different from that of the Hindus
and Muslims. Their low infant mortality
rates can only be explained by their better
knowledge of child care and more educated
women, and above all, their readiness, to
SOME OBSERVATIONS ON INFANT MORTALITY IN INDIA

adopt, whenever economic factors permit,
certain features of what is called the European
way of life in India.

Even more interesting are the figures for
Bombay city where infant mortality rates
by communities show what reduction is
possible under certain conditions. Bombay
city is international in its population composition but the communities for which
comparable figures are available are the
Hindus (both the scheduled and the socalled high castes), Muslims, Indian Christians, Parsees and Europeans. While vital
statistics in the city of Bombay are probably
one of the most reliable series included, those
for the Parsees are even mcre so, especially
their mortality statistics, in view of their
particular method of disposing of the dead
(the tower of silence) which necessitates
complete registration. Table 7 gives the
comparative rates for recent years.

1946-47 308 185 189 179 72 37

These rates are instructive, for the communal differentials in the infant mortality
rates may be taken to be roughly comparable
to the United Kingdom Registrar General’s
five-fold social classification. While all
these communities, with the exception of
the Europeans, are ethnically Indian, each
has its own peculiar milieu readily distinguishable from the others. Socio-cultural

patterns of living, involving age-old habits,’

customs and traditions, affecting cleanliness,
eating, clothing, child-care and almost every
detail of daily living, are conditioned by the
communal mores.

These figures demonstrate how two Indian
communities—the Hindus and the Parsees—
living in the same city can have such
divergent infant mortality rates. The
Hindus, who form an overwhelming majority
of the population, have a rate of about 300
while the Parsees who constitute the smallest

223

minority have a rate of about 70 per 1,000
live births. The Indian Christians whose
infant mortality rates in the provinces
are much lower than those of the Hindus
have higher rates in Bombay city. This is
probably the result of the heavy incursion of
Catholics from Goa most of whom belong
to low educational and income groups. The
Parsees constitute a well educated, advanced
and relatively well-to-do group with more
or less a Western way of life. While the
Parsees live in relative ease and enlightenment they do not live in a vacuum, for their
infants are more or less exposed to the same
environmental hazards as the infants of
other communities. The real explanation
here is probably one of income differentials
as reflected in the different areas of residence,
for Bombay has its Park Avenues as well as
its East Ends.

The evolution of Parsi infant mortality
during the last five decades is closer to certain
European countries than to any Indian
community. Table 8 presents the population
numbers and the infant mortality rates of
the Parsees for the last six decennial years.

(Indian Union)

In the first quarter of the twentieth
century the Parsi infant mortality rate
was between 150 and 200 and in some years
exceeded 200. In the next ten years the
rate came down to about 100. Since 1945
the rate has declined considerably and to-day
it is about fifty. The present Parsi rate is
far below those registered for other Indian
communities.

The Parsees, who constitute only -03 per
cent of the total Indian population, are
predominantly urban, and more than half
of them live in Bombay city. The rest are
distributed all over India, but most of them
live in the state of Bombay. It should be
possible for other communities to reach this
224

low mortality record, given relative high
levels of income and education and better
housing.

The Causes of Infant Mortality

What are the causes of such infant mortality as India has experienced during this
period? If Indian vital statistics in the
sense of mere registration of births and
deaths are inadequate and inaccurate, the
registered causes of mortality are even more
so. A majority of deaths, including those
of infants, occur outside hospitals and
clinics and by and large unattended by
doctors. While 70 per cent of the total
population live in villages which have no
hospitals, about 80 per cent of the
qualified medical personnel live in urban
India. As death certificates, showing cause
of death, are not issued by medical authorities
for the area of registration as a whole, it is
difficult to establish precisely the medical
causes for the high infant mortality in India.

Though exact figures are not available it is
known that a great majority of deliveries
take place outside hospitals and maternity
homes ; births taking place in the home are
not necessarily attended even by trained
midwives. While actual figures are not
available to establish percentages an informed guess would put the number of
home deliveries unattended by medical
personnel at about 7o per cent of total
births. Even small sample inquiries into the
causes of infant deaths have been impossible
on account of difficulties in performing postmortem examinations.

The Public Health Commissioner with the
Government of India in his Annual Report
for 1931 points out: “ In India, statistics of
causes of infantile mortality are not recorded
but it is generally known that premature
births, convulsions, fevers, malnutrition,
respiratory diseases and bowel complaints
are main causative factors in the death rate
under one year.’’ In his Annual Report for
1934 he states: “‘ The poor nutrition of the
mother, over-crowding, a high birth rate and
a high maternal mortality rate, frequent
prematurity and the prevalence of respiratory
diseases, convulsions, malaria and syphilis,

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

combined with widespread ignorance of
infant management—all contribute to the
great loss of infant life in India. The birth
rate, as also the infantile death rate, is
high among the poorer classes, owing to the
inaccessibility to them of efficient medical
service.’ Thus, for the former provinces
which constituted the general registration
area till 1947 we have no statistics beyond
intelligent guesses based on general practitioners’ knowledge of the people and their
health problems in and outside their homes.

However, it has been established that
causes of infant deaths can be grouped
roughly into two main classes, namely those
responsible for death within one month of
birth (neo-natal mortality) and those responsible for mortality between the second and
the twelfth months. Deaths in the first
group are primarily due to prenatal and
natal influences. The second group covers
those who have succumbed in the main to
causes arising from postnatal influences such
asthe various epidemic diseases, diseases of
the respiratory system, faulty feeding and
other environmental factors.

In view of the difficulties of the Indian
situation, the causes for the first group are
probably more easily ascertained than for the
second group. For the first group they are :
ill-advised pregnancies in the sense that
they are not advised at all in view of the
health of the potential mother ; frequent and
ill-spaced pregnancies; absence of antenatal care; malnutrition and low vitality
of the expectant mother to begin with, and
malnutrition during her pregnancy ; insanitary surroundings ; absence of trained midwives and health visitors ; the damaging and
‘meddlesome midwifery of the Daz, the
ignorant, indigenous midwife; and _ last,
maternal mortality itself as a cause of
infant mortality. This last factor is often
ignored but in an underdeveloped country
like India where the incidence of maternal
mortality itself is abnormal, its relation to
infant survival must not be lost sight of.
Perhaps the dominating factor affecting the
health and welfare of the baby, in fact, in
most cases, the very survival of the baby,
is the mother. Her health, attitude, ability
SOME OBSERVATIONS ON INFANT MORTALITY IN INDIA

and understanding are directly concerned
with the welfare of the baby. It is obvious
that the death of the mother during labour
or before the baby reaches its first birthday
has a profound effect on its survival and
welfare even in advanced societies, but in
India, the chances of adequate care for an
orphaned baby are remote. Foster motherhood, even when it exists in the family home,
can seldom take the place of the dead
mother with all her care, attention and
instinctive affection.

The causes of mortality in the second
group are more difficult to establish in the
absence of statistics. However, statistics of a
limited nature are available for some major
cities where infant death returns by causes
have been more or less obligatory. About
nine cities have statistics for some of the
years within the half-century under discussion and there are some random sample
studies of infant mortality. |

Of the former, the statistics of causes of
death provided by the Bombay City Executive Health Officer for a number of years
appear to be reliable in that they represent
continuity of observation. A composite list
from such statistics for a period of twentyfive years, 1925-50, is given below in the
order of their importance. The order is
based on the percentage of deaths of infants
due to these various causes, which are rather
vague and would not satisfy the needs of
modern social medicine, but it must be
remembered that even in a city like Bombay
infant deaths are not necessarily certified
by a qualified pediatrician ; the list, how
225

ever, does give an indication of the infantile
ailments that prove fatal in India. They
are: infantile debility, malformation and
premature birth ; respiratory diseases ; convulsions; diarrhoea and enteritis; small-pox;
dysentery -; measles; fevers, particularly
malaria.

To these must be added poor mothercraft
and the woeful lack of a general education
of the expectant mother. Reproduction and
motherhood are held to be natural processes
but when they are beset by so much
morbidity and mortality there appears to
be something almost unnatural about them. |

If infant mortality is conceded to be the
most sensitive index of a nation’s social
welfare, public sanitation and hygiene,
India’s claim to any real development of
these services is small indeed. What has
been achieved elsewhere in controlling and
conquering these fatal ailments must be
possible in India. “ Health’ as René Sand
pointed out long ago, “‘ is purchasable. Each
country, within certain limits, decides its
own death rates.’”’ A community can achieve

conspicuous success in infant welfare pri
marily through the education of its mothers ;
educated and enlightened mothers may be
expected to educate the rulers who appear
to be so impervious to the needs of the most
helpless section of the community, as well as
to the recognition of the potential value of
our infants as future citizens of the country.
Such an education presupposes an awareness,

but. such an awareness is only beginning to

dawn in the minds of the people and the
Government of India.
