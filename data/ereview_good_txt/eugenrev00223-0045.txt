The 1961 Census of Great Britain

SOME

OW THAT THE first results of the
Census taken on April 23rd have been
published, it is possible to examine the
growth of population by regions, within the
British Isles, and similarly to study changes in
the numbers of households. It is as yet much
too early to know the results of analyses by
age, sex, occupation or family size.
The rates of growth per annum in the various
countries and islands for the periods 1939-51
and 1951-61 have been as follows:

1939-51 1951-61

England 0-46 0°54

- Wales... 0-45 0-16
Scotland . 0°15 0:24
Northern Ireland 0:48 0-39
Irish Republic .. 0-08 0-43
Isle of Man 0:51 1-36
Jersey oe 0-98 0-02
Guernsey etc. .. 0-04 0:36
Total 0-41 0-43

In total, the pace of increase has remained
steady but regionally there have been wide
variations, mainly attributable to migration.

The following is an analysis of the actual
growth of population in England and Wales
into its component elements:

(Numbers in thousands)

1939-51 1951-61

Births 8,330 7,121
Deaths .. . 6,263 5,159
Net Inward Migration 231 352
Net increase 2,298 2,314

In considering these figures it should be
remembered that the two periods are not of
equal length; the first is one of twelve years, the
second of ten years.

The distribution year by year of the increase
between 1951 and 1961 is interesting; for suc
FACTS

cessive twelve-month periods it is approximately
as follows:

YEAR OF EXCESS OF BIRTHS NET INWARD
DECENNIUM OVER DEATHS MIGRATION

1 185 —26

2 159 —2A4

3 193 17

4 141 5

5 171 25

6 226 0

7 183 14

8 213 48

9 251 108

10 240 219

The figures for the tenth year are not given

’ by the Registrar General but may be deduced

approximately from the data he supplies. He
states that the gain from net immigration during
a recent twelve-month period “is estimated to
have exceeded the excess of births over deaths.”

The corresponding analyses for other parts
of the British Isles are not yet available.

The areas of England “benefiting” mainly
from migration of all kinds during 1951-61 are
the Eastern (455,000), South-Eastern (319,000),
and Southern (237,000). These gained much of
the over-spill from the Greater London Area,
which actually lost 502,000 persons in the
decennium. Small losses through movements of
population were recorded for many of the other
regions of the British Isles.

While the rise in total population between the
two most recent censuses was one of a little
over 5 per cent, the number of households
increased by 12 per cent to 14-7 million, owing
mainly no doubt to earlier and more frequent
marriages. These in turn must have been encouraged by the fact that the number of private
dwellings increased by 21 per cent to 14-6
million and now almost equals the number of
households, whereas in 1951 it was one million
short.
