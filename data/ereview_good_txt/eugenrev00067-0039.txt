OUR AVERAGE AGE
By Sir CHARLES ARDEN-CLOSE, K.B.E., C.B., F.RS.

HE public of this country has been
warned by letters and articles in the
newspapers and by the reports of the
Royal Commission on Population that the
numbers of old and elderly persons continue
to increase in comparison with the numbers
of the young. And, broadly, the correct idea
is spread that our population is becoming
older. It is, however, doubtful if there is
generally any clear notion as to the character
of the process and how it can be measured.
As a fact we can measure the general effect
by calculating the average age of the population, and this kind of simple calculation is
rendered easy by the use of a table of population by age groups, such as that published by
the General Register Office in its excellent
pamphlet entitled Matters of Life and Death
(H.M.S.O., 1948). I have calculated the
figures for 1841, 1861, 1881 and 1901. The
figures for I192I, 1931, 1941 and 1947 have
been kindly supplied by the General Register
Office. I had also calculated the figures for
I93I and 1947, and these agree with the
results given by that office, so I hope that
there are no mistakes in my arithmetic!
The following table gives the results :
THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE POPULATION OF

ENGLAND AND WALES
Average Age

Year in Years
1841 25-9
1861 26.5
1881 26.3
I9OI 27-4
1921 30.5
1931 32.7
1941 sae 34-9
1947 . 35°5

But it is difficult to realize the meaning of
these figures unless they are plotted. The
diagram below shows clearly what has
been happening. We may say that, for the
last seventy years, the growth of the average
age has pursued a fairly steady course. It is
curious to note what little effect seems to have
been made by the two world wars, in which
so many of our men between 20 and 45 were
killed. That is perhaps because the average

age of those killed did not differ greatly from
the general average.

The average age is affected by the general
health of the community, by epidemics, by
wars, by migration and, of course, by the
rates of birth and death. But the general
health, as indicated by the life table, is, no

‘doubt, the largest factor, and we may con
gratulate ourselves and the medical profession on the remarkable progress shown by the
diagram.

Let me here quote a passage from that
valuable work by Dublin and Lotka, entitled
Length of Life, published in New York in
1936 : “‘ Could we sum up before the mind’s
eye the conditions of fifty or a hundred years
ago we should be looking on a world much
saddened by the frequency of death. Ina
community of a given size funerals were in
those days two or three times as many as
they are to-day. ... And the darkest side of
the picture was that so many deaths were
those of very young children, adolescents
and adults in early maturity.” In this
country also, a hundred years ago, we had
large families and a fairly high death-rate,
and this was still more the case in the
eighteenth century ; many a village church
is a witness to the prevalence of death
in early and middle life. Now we live longer
lives and have smaller families. So far as
numbers are concerned the smaller families
tend to counterbalance the increase due to
our improved health.

To come back to the diagram, the increase
in the average age is to be noted first about

1881, with an increasing increase until about
1931, and then a slight tendency to a decreasing increase. It looks as if the census of 1951
would show an average of rather more than
35°5 ; but we shall see. The general picture is
encouraging ; our average age has increased
mainly because we are healthier and live

longer. The mean expectation of life at

almost to 69 years, a truly remarkable figure.
We are fitter than we used to be at middle
age and in old age, and it is for consideration
whether our various schemes for retiring
ages and pensions do not need revision.

NOTES AND MEMORANDA

N.A.M.C.W. Annual Conference

THE National Association for Maternity and
Child Welfare (June 28th-30th) successfully
tried out a new form of programme for their
Annual Conference. On the first day there
was a series of twenty-minute addresses by
experts. The first of these addresses was
given by Dr. Fraser Roberts on “‘ Eugenics
and the Influence of Heredity.”” The conference then split up into groups each to
discuss the points raised by one of the
speakers. On the final day the rapporteurs
of each group presented an account of their
proceedings to the main conference.

Dr. Fraser Roberts’s address and the report
of the group which discussed his address
presented by Dr. C. O. Carter was published
in full in the August issue of Mother and
Child.
