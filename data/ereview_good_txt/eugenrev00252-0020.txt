POPULATION TRENDS IN SOUTHERN
RHODBSIA, 1941 to 1981
By J. R. H. SHAUL, M.Sc. (Econ.), B.Com.

(Government Statistician, Southern Rhodesia)

LEADING public man in Southern
A Bins once stated that the new

countries would have to look to their
cradles for any increase in their population.
It is therefore of interest to investigate the
forces governing the rate of increase of the
European population in the absence of either
immigration or emigration.

Estimation of Reproduction Rates

The factors governing all movements of.

future populations are summarized by the
net reproduction rate of a country, i.e., the
index which measures the extent to which
1,000 women of child-bearing age at the
present date are replaced by women of childbearing ages in the next generation. In
order to obtain the net reproduction rate of
a country it is essential that the official
statistics should record the age of the mother
at the date of birth of the child. Unfortunately this information is not obtained in
Southern Rhodesia and it is to be hoped that
remedial measures will be taken to remove
this defect. In the absence of statistics I am
indebted to Dr. Kuczynski for the following
method of estimating the net reproduction
rate of the Colony.

The estimate is obtained by applying the
specific fertility rates by quinquennial age
groups of :

(1) A European country with a high fertility rate,

(2) A European country with a low fertility rate,

(3) The Union of South Africa,

to the corresponding age groups of the
Southern Rhodesian female population. The
European countries selected were Finland
and France. The object of using the rates
contained in (1) and (2) is to set upper and

lower limits to the margin of error of the
estimate.

It is further assumed that although specific
fertility rates in Southern Rhodesia are not the
same as in the countries selected they are
nevertheless proportionate to the respective
rates in these countries. As an example the
working of the estimate for the Union of South
Africa is described. Applying the Union
specific fertility rates for the year 1936 to the
age groups of women of child-bearing age in
Southern Rhodesia in 1936 gives 1,353
births, and a total fertility of-2,971 births to
I,000 women. But the yearly number of
births in Southern Rhodesia in 1936 was only.
1,272, so that total fertility at Union rates is
too high and must be corrected in the proportion of 1,272/1,353. This correction gives a
total fertility of 2,793 for Southern Rhodesia.
Of the 1,272 births 616 were females, so that
the total number of females replacing every
1,000 mothers of child-bearing age in 1936

1,272 1,353. The gross repro
duction rate is therefore 1-353. Similar
estimates using fertility rates for Finland
(1871-5) and France (1935) give 1°392 and
I +332 respectively. The gross reproduction
rate for Southern Rhodesia in 1936 can
therefore be given as between 1-33 and 1-39
or approximately 1-3 5. Some of the women
will die before passing through the full
period of child-bearing age. By utilizing
Southern Rhodesia Life Table No. 1* anda
similar method it is estimated that every
I,000 women in 1936 of child-bearing age are
being replaced by 1,180 females in those ages
or that the net reproduction rate is approximately 1-18.

Comparison with Other Reproduction Rates

The net reproduction rate of the Colony
compares favourably with that of other
Western European countries. Table I gives
comparative figures for a number of countries :

varied only slightly, and in order to estimate
future population it is assumed that the
same level of the birth-rate and specific
fertility rates will be maintained. In estimating the future population the specific
fertility rates prevailing in the Union of

If the Colony is therefore compelled to look
to its own cradles for its future population,
conditions are at present favourable to a
steady growth of population due to a steady
increase in the number of potential mothers.
Fertility rates would have to fall considerably to counteract this natural advantage.
Examination of the above figures shows that
as regards the natural increase of population
the problem of Southern Rhodesia is very
different from that of Great Britain. In
order to arrest a declining population the
latter country is faced with the problem of
reversing a continuous decline in the number
of potential mothers by raising the net
reproduction rate above 1:0, whereas in
order to maintain a rising population, Southern Rhodesia merely has to maintain the
existing rates of fertility, any increase in the
nét reproduction rate representing an acceleration in the rate of growth of the Colony’ S
population.

Estimated Growth of Population, 1941-81
Disregarding migration movements (i.e.,
assuming emigration is exactly balanced by
immigration), what growth in population can
Southern Rhodesia expect from natural
increases alone? Birth-rates, though very
much higher than in Great Britain, show the
downward trend common to all Western
European countries. Since 1925 the rate has

South Africa in 1936 have been adopted, and
the resulting figures have been corrected in
the manner employed for estimating the net
reproduction rate. Southern Rhodesia Life
Table No. r has been employed to estimate
the deaths, and in so far as expectation of
life improves in future years, deaths have been
over-estimated. The 1941 population is taken
to comprise Southern Rhodesians resident in
the Colony in 1941, so that all overseas
persons connected with Air Training schools,
Polish refugees and internees from other
territories are excluded and Southern Rhode
‘Slans serving in the armed forces outside the

Colony are included. On these assumptions,
Table II shows the estimated growth of
population of Southern Rhodesia residents
due to natural increase alone during the
next forty years.

On the basis of natural increase alone, the
population of the Colony will not reach the
neighbourhood of 100,000 Europeans until
the end of the present century. The birthrates set out in Table II must not be regarded
as estimates of the actual birth-rate of the
Colony in these years, but as the birth-rate
that might be expected if there were no
migration. They represent a minimum below
which the birth-rate will not fall (see p. 60)
unless fertility rates decline during the next
forty years. The movement in the birthrate in spite of the constant fertility rates

assumed in the estimates is an interesting
example of the effect of changes in the age
constitution of women of child-bearing ages
upon birth-rates. This matter receives
further attention in the section dealing with
the age distribution of the female population.
These estimates may be regarded as conservative because vital statistics published
since the computation of these figures show
that, under the stimulus of war-time prosperity, maternity benefits to the dependants
of members of the Defence Forces, etc.,
specific fertility rates during the years 1941
to 1944 are more than Io per cent higher than
in 1936, but it is probable there will be a
corresponding decline after the war. If, however, this higher order of fertility were to
persist throughout the post-war period
covered by this article, it is estimated that
the total population in 1981 would be over
90,000 persons. .

 

Estimated Age Constitution of the Population

On the assumptions already described the
following figures of the age distribution of
the Colony (see Tables III to V) have been
prepared by projecting forward the existing
five-year groups every five years, and
utilizing the life table to adjust them for
deaths in the intervening years.

During the next forty years the numbers
of boys aged 14 and under should gradually
increase from 9,129 to 11,378, but the trend
does not rise steadily, there being a slightly
downward movement in the decade 1951 to
1961. Increasing the school-leaving age to
16 would involve providing for an additional
500 to 600 boys from the date at which the
increase took place.

It is noticeable that the dependent population (assumed to be males below 15 and
over 60) increases relatively to the earning
population, the figures being 361 per 1,000

males in 1941 and 414 per 1,000 males in
1981. This movement is of material interest
in connection with expenditure on children’s
allowances and pensions in any social
security scheme. The burden on the gainfully occupied male population should grow
with the lapse of time unless lightened by
immigration during the period. Increased
fertility rates would increase the burden of
children’s allowances until such time as the
new population arrived at an earning age.
Decreasing fertility rates would lower the
burden of children’s allowances for the time
being, but would ultimately increase the
population aged 60 and over relatively to the
total population. The age groups 20-34 and
35-44 indicate the section of the male population that would be available for military
service in time of need during these years.
Relatively to the whole male population
these groups are smaller in 1981 than in 1941.

case of boys. This is attributable to the
greater expectation of life in the female
population, which gives rise to a greater
relative increase in women over 60 between
1941 and 1g98x than in the corresponding
age group for men.

The ages of women, between 15 and 50 are
given in five-yearly periods in order to illustrate how important are the effects on the
birth-rate of changes in the age constitution
of women during this period. The decline in
the birth-rate from 22-9 per 1,000 in 1941 to
18-4 per 1,000 in 1956 (despite constant
fertility rates) is entirely due to the ageing
of the groups 25-29 and 30-34 in 1941. As
the women in these groups grow older they
are replaced by the smaller number of women
who were in the groups 15-19 and 20-24 in
1941, and as women in the former age groups
are the most fertile the birth-rate suffers in
1946, 1951 and 1956. After 1956 the normal

boys also apply to the number of girls, but .
relatively to the total female population the
number of girls in this age group (namely
0-14) should decline more rapidly than in the

growth of the female population has caught

up with the numbers in the groups 25-29 and
30-34 in 1941 and the birth-rate commences
to rise again. However, by 1981 the decline
in female births between 1941 and 1956
60 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

again makes its effect felt on the women in
the groups 25-29 and 30-34, with the result
that the birth-rate declines again but not so
steeply. The wave movement started in
1941 has to work itself out in waves of
diminishing intensity. This is an interesting
illustration of how birth-rates can fluctuate
even if conditions of fertility remain constant and every woman of child-bearing age
has on the average the same number of
children over as long a period as forty years.

Influence of Immigration

Another interesting feature of the above
analysis is the light it sheds on the influence
of immigration on birth-rates in Southern
Rhodesia. The relatively large numbers of
women aged 25-29 and 30-34 in 1941 were
the result of immigration which mainly
affects these ages. The present study, which
ignores migration, shows that this group
cannot be maintained at its 1941 relative
level by natural increase alone. Every
immigrant gained in these ages during the
post-war period will therefore tend to
increase the birth-rate above the minimum
rates already estimated.

     
  
   
   
  
    
 

Tables III to V bring out clearly the
increasing burden of old age pensions in any
social security scheme relating to the European population. This is due to the ageing of
the population but would be lightened by a
stream of immigration in the 15 to 59 groups.
Children decline relatively to the rest of the
population, so that a family allowance would
gradually become less burdensome. Children
and old people combined represented 359
out of every 1,000 persons in 1941 and 418
out of every 1,000 in 1981.

Another way of regarding the subject is to
take all males of 16 and under 60 and all
females of 16 and under 25 as potential
contributors to social insurance and all
other persons as either non-contributors or
actual beneficiaries. The proportions of
males and females in these ages come to 390
per I,000 persons in 1941 and 352 per 1,000
in 1981. Thus, in the conditions assumed,
the contributors to any social security
scheme would decline while the potential

beneficiaries would increase relatively to the

whole population during the next forty
years. In so far as a stream of immigrants is
maintained in the earning ages tt 60 this
burden will be alleviated.
