GENETIC-HYGIENIC EXPERIENCES IN.

DENMARK IN RECENT YEARS*
By TAGE KEMP, MD.

University Institute for Human Genetics, Copenhagen

UGENICS had begun to develop
Beer the rediscovery of Mendel’s
laws in the year 1900.

In 1883 Francis Galton first formulated
the principles of eugenics. Galton was fully
aware that at that time the possibilities of
practising eugenic theories were small, since
little was known then of hereditary conditions in man. He therefore started comprehensive family studies and was the first to
undertake systematic twin investigations.
As, however, the basic genetic laws were not
yet known, he did not reach far by these
studies, and eugenics consequently remained
mainly speculative.

Galton himself wrote the following about ©

eugenics:

Eugenics is the science which deals with all
influences that improve the inborn qualities of
a race; also those that develop them to the
utmost advantage. What is meant by improvement? There is considerable difference between
goodness in the several qualities and in that of
the character as a whole. The character depends
largely on the proportion between qualities
whose balance may be much influenced by
education. We must therefore leave morals as
far as possible out of the discussion, not entangling ourselves with the almost hopeless difficulties
they raise as to whether a character as a whole
is good or bad. Moreover, the goodness or badness of character is not absolute, but relative to
the current form of civilization.

Positive eugenics meets with almost in
superable difficulties. Superman cannot be
artificially produced. Marriage and reproduction cannot be carried through by
compulsion. Indirectly positive eugenic
policies have been pursued, and perhaps
not unsuccessfully, but we cannot with
certainty characterize the ends gained this

13th, 1957.

way as an advantage to humanity. Accordingly no detailed account will be given of
positive eugenics either.

Negative eugenics arose nearly seventy
years ago in connection with the great
progress made in natural science by the end
of the nineteenth century, with a direct
bearing on Darwin’s theory of evolution
and as a consequence of this.

However, by the time the concept of
eugenics was formed the conditions for its
practical employment were not yet present.
Nearly fifty years elapsed before medical
genetics, in connection with the introduction
of modern biological genetics, had reached
such a development that it could form a
basis for eugenic measures being carried out.

The correct use of eugenics was not
recognized for the first fitty years after its”
introduction.

From the outset it was associated with an
idea that particularly valuable families
exist whose propagation ought to be encouraged. These ideas, marked by the
English thought of ‘the fit contra the
unfit’ and of “the good human stocks ”’
were rather obscure, though in the main
harmless. In America, on the other hand,
the first development of eugenics was associated with an idea of the existence of
particularly harmful and dangerous families,
who are very expensive to society; here,
therefore, the aim of eugenics became that
of sparing society this expense.

In Germany eugenics underwent a more
disastrous development with its unrealistic
ideas of superman and worthless racial
elements, a development which ended in
catastrophe.

To our knowledge eugenics has not yet
obtained a footing in Eastern Europe,

THE EUGENICS REVIEW, April, 1957. 49, 1

because here the development that has
taken place within the biological sciences
during the past few decades differs somewhat
from that in Western Europe. The basis for
an understanding of genetic hygiene is therefore not yet present in these countries.

In the Scandinavian countries various
eugenic provisions have been introduced
during the past twenty years. These are
chiefly based on the view that eugenics is a
purely medical subject with the sole task of
preventing disease. This form of eugenics
is termed genetic hygiene.

Genetic Hygiene

Genetic hygiene corresponds in the main
to negative qualitative eugenics, and may
also be characterized as follows:

It rests definitely on the principle of
-voluntariness. Genetic-hygienic measures
are taken exclusively at the desire of the
persons concerned. Experience shows that
patients, after having been informed on the
significance of the hereditary taint, nearly
always follow their doctor’s advice within
this field.

In the countries where genetic-hygienic
laws exist containing directions for the
employment of eugenic measures, these laws
guide patients and doctors, and they contain
safeguards against the misuse of the often
serious measures which have to be taken.

The most important negative eugenic
measures are sterilization, induced abortion,
prohibition of marriage, matrimonial advice,
and other forms of genetic advice, and finally
segregation of the individual in a hospital
or other institution.

It is a matter of genetic-hygienic
importance that patients with hereditary
diseases should stay for a considerable
length of time in hospitals or institutions,
or be kept under public care. This results
in a shorter or longer segregation of such
individuals, which naturally lowers their
chances of procreation. Thus, hospital or
institutional treatment, public care, and
general knowledge of the mental defectives,
epileptics, deaf, blind, and crippled are of
genetic-hygienic importance.

' THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Finally, the break-up of isolates where
inbreeding causes recessive diseases to prevail, may be of genetic-hygienic significance.

It is sometimes stated that the main
purpose of genetic hygiene is to spare the
community a great deal of expense. This
is, of course, a great mistake. Negative
eugenic measures are of an entirely medical
character aiming at preventing disease and
misfortune. Like other preventive measures
within medicine they naturally mean a
saving to the public in the long run, as the
diseases would have cost far more than the
amount expended on their prevention.

Genetic hygiene as defined here is of
recent date. The basis for a correct execution
of genetic-hygienic measures has only existed
during the past few decades.

First, we must consider the great development which medical genetics has undergone
and the widespread knowledge of its results,
not only among physicians, but also to some
extent in the general population. Thorough
instruction in human genetics, especially
genetic pathology, ought therefore to be
included in the medical curriculum. Furthermore, general information on the spread
and significance of the hereditary diseases
constitutes a basis for genetic hygiene.

Other requirements must also be fulfilled
before an efficient genetic-hygienic programme can be carried through. The public
health system and social care must be
well organized. Where hospitals and other
institutions for diseased and defective indi.viduals, as well as the public care system,
have attained a certain standard, we can
through these institutions trace many
patients with hereditary diseases. These
patients will then be isolated or be under
some control during the period of their
reproductive power. On the other hand,
the carrying through of efficient social laws
presupposes genetic-hygienic measures.

ow Moreover, a medico-genetic registration
carried through in various countries or parts
of countries would be a great aid in the
effective application of genetic hygiene.

By such a genetic-hygienic registration
we imply elaboration, as far as possible, of
a complete register or card-index, continually
. GENETIC-HYGIENIC EXPERIENCES IN DENMARK 13

brought up-to date, of all the patients with
severe hereditary diseases within a certain
area, and of the members of their families.
(See below.)

A registration of this kind can help in
many ways in genetic-hygienic questions.
In the individual cases the data of the
patients concerned and their relatives can
easily be procured and used as a basis for a
solution of the genetic-hygienic problem at
hand. Furthermore, by means of a genetichygienic registration we can to a certain
extent follow and control hereditary diseases
in a population. We can ascertain whether
they decrease or increase in frequency and
form an estimate as to whether the genetichygienic measures are carried through in the
right way in the cases of diseases where it is
an advantage to make use of these measures,
and only in these cases.

The genetic-hygienic laws introduced
during the past fifty years or so in various
countries indicate how genetic-hygienic views
have come to prevail in a steadily increasing
number of places. They show how the first
faltering attempts have been made to solve
the genetic-hygienic problems, and will
therefore here be briefly mentioned.

The genetic-hygenic laws employed so far
fall within the following domains: sterilization, induced abortion, marriage and social
laws.

Sterilization

In Europe sterilization laws have existed

since 1929. They were first introduced in |

the Canton of Waadt in Switzerland, and
later in the same year in Denmark. Then
followed Norway (1934), Sweden (1935,
revised 1941), Finland (1935), and Iceland
(1938). In Germany (from 1934) and
Esthonia they have had sterilization laws
which probably are no longer in force. In
other countries, such as England, Holland,
Hungary, Czecho-Slovakia, and Poland,
sterilization laws have been considered, but
not carried through. |

In 1951 sterilization laws are thus found
in all the Scandinavian countries.

There is reason to point out that the
patiént himself must apply for sterilization,
this being, in other words, voluntary, and
that each case is thoroughly, tested and
assessed by medical experts. In the other
Scandinavian countries sterilization laws
follow in the main the same principles,
though differences are found.

The total number of sterilizations in
Denmark for the first twenty-five years was
about 8,600, as Table 1 shows. During the
next twenty-five years it will probably
exceed 10,000.

Just over two-thirds of the individuals
who submitted to sterilization were mental
defectives, and of these, about two-thirds
were females. Among those sterilized for
other indications than mental deficiency
the preponderance of females was even
higher, about seven-eighths. Of late years
almost as many mentally deficient as individuals without amentia have been sterilized.
In 1950 the latter exceeded the former
in number for the first time. Various
other hereditary diseases, besides mental
deficiency, warranted sterilization, e.g.
mental diseases, psychopathy, nervous
diseases, diseases of internal organs, eye
and ear diseases, skin diseases, and malformations. In no small number of cases there
was a supporting medico-social indication.

Induced Abortion

Nearly 2,300 years ago Plato mentioned
the possibility of induced abortion for
eugenic reasons. His proposal passed unnoticed, however. In 1939 Denmark, Iceland
and Sweden introduced laws permitting
induced abortion on eugenic grounds. In
1950 similar laws were introduced in
Finland.

In Denmark about 5,000 legal induced
abortions have been performed yearly for
the last five to ten years, a large proportion
of the operations have been carried out
entirely or in part on eugenic grounds, at
a rough estimate 1,000-2,000 cases a year;
of these foetuses perhaps about I0o ‘would
have been mental defectives. .

Table 1 shows as mentioned a number of
legal sterilizations in Denmark during
twenty-five years. During the first decade
the average number of sterilizations was
about 150 a year because the legislation
was new and was being tried out. In the
next decade the average number was about
three times as high, and during the last
five-year period the number has still been
increasing. In Table 2 the number of sterilizations has been divided into two groups,
one including feeble-minded exclusively and
one counting all other diagnoses. It might
be noted that the number of feeble-minded
sterilized per year has been somewhat lesser
during the last five-year period. But the
number of other diagnoses has on the other
hand increased. It is partly because the
number of feeble-minded who merit sterilization has now reached a certain level where
only patients from one age-group have to
be sterilized, and partly because the definition of feeble-mindedness has changed during
recent years and several mild cases have
been moved from the category “‘ feebleminded ”’ to the category ‘ other diseases.”

Table 3 shows the age distribution of the
sterilized feeble-minded during the last fiveyear period. As it is seen the greatest
frequency appears in the age-group 20-24
for men as well as for women. The average
age on the whole is a little smaller for
women than for men.

Genetic-Hygienic Ascertainment

An important aid to the carrying through
of genetic-hygienic measures is the establishment of a genetic-hygienic registration
comprising as far as possible a complete
register or card-index, continually brought
up to date, of all the patients with severe
hereditary diseases within the country and
also their families.

A registration of this kind can be useful
in many ways in connection with genetichygienic questions. If in a given case the
question of genetic-hygienic measures is
raised, the card-index will furnish information about the person or persons in question
and their families. It will thus be easier to
give advice in many cases.
GENETIC-HYGIENIC EXPERIENCES IN DENMARK 15

In Denmark a genetic-hygienic register,
a medico-genetic ascertainment, was estab-.

lished in 1938 and is kept at the University
Institute for Human Genetics in Copen
hagen. This register is continually brought.

up to date covering so far as possible all the
patients with severe hereditary diseases
within the country.

A physician who is to make a genetic
prognosis must, of course, procure information on the hereditary taint in the family.
Not all physicians have realized this fact.
For a proper genetic prognosis it is, however,
absolutely. necessary that the physician
takes the, sometimes very great, trouble of
procuring this information. The task of the
physician in this connection is in the first
instance to make a genetic prognosis for the
offspring of a person or a married couple,
in cases where information is available on
diseases in one or both parents and in their
families. It is not always possible to give
a definite percentage figure for the chances
that a child in whose family a certain
hereditary disease occurs will inherit this
disease.

The physician is frequently asked about
the advisability of having children by
patients with some hereditary taint or other.
These questions may often be difficult to
answer. In Denmark the genetic-hygienic
register at the University Institute for
Human Genetics, Copenhagen, is often
consulted by physicians, practising physicians, specialists or physicians connected
with institutions or hospitals. Then the
institute procures information on the family
and answers the prognostic question as well
as possible. The card-index may furnish
information about the persons in question
and their families; studies at the same time
constitute a starting point for medico-genetic
studies of the various diseases, which form
the necessary basis for all genetic-hygienic
activity.

During the period 1939-1956 (Table 4)
the Institute for Human Genetics received
nearly I1,403 inquiries concerning genetichygienic problems (including legal abortion,
sterilization and genetic counselling).

16 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

On going through the individual entries in
Table 5 we find that physical malformations
comprise a large number of different defects,
e.g. harelip, cleft palate, anencephaly, dysostosis,
cranio-facialis, osteogenesis imperfecta, chon- drodystrophy, craniorhachischisis, splithandsand
feet, ectrodactylism, congenital amputations,
syndactylia, and brachydactylia, clubfoot, congenital dislocation of the hip or other joints,
multiple exostoses, malformations of the genitals
and several other malformations.

Among the ear-lesions that may be the reason
for genetic counselling by far the most frequent
is the sporadic recessive deaf-mutism, the next
are labyrinthine deafness, partial or total, and
otosclerosis.

Among the eye-lesions in connection with
genetic-hygienic advice we may mention aniridia, retinitis pigmentosa, anophthalmos,
microphthalmos, cataract, optic nerve atrophy,
microphthalmia, myopia, coloboma iridis, glaucoma, strabismus, nystagmus and _ ptosis
palpebrae.

Among skin diseases the following may be
mentioned: ichthyosis cong. and _ vulgaris,
eczema, prurigo Besnier, psoriasis, albinismus,

- and alopecia cong. totalis.

Among the diseases of the internal organs the
most frequent are diabetes mellitus, hemophilia,
thrombopenia, fibropenia and other hemorrhagic diatheses, hemolytic jaundice, congenital
cardiac defects, allergic diseases, polyarthritis.
(rheumatoid arthritis), adiposity, Graves’
disease, myxoedema and certain types of
tumours. Furthermore, erytroblastosis foetalis .

must be mentioned and cases of toxoplasmosis |

or rubella infections during pregancy.

Questions of genetic-hygienic advice are often |

prompted by the fear that an expected child
might suffer from epilepsy. Other nervous
diseases are more infrequent. The most common
are Huntington’s chorea,
muscular dystrophy, dystrophia myotonica,
congenital hyperthrophic myotonia, spinal muscular atrophy, infantile progressive muscular

atrophy, Friedreich’s ataxia, nervosismus and _

neurosis, diffuse cerebral sclerosis,
sclerosis, amyotonia, lipothymia,
neurofibromatosis and cerebral palsies.
Among the forms of oligophrenia, the defects
mentioned have been mental inferiority (retarded), feeble-mindedness, mongoloid idiocy,
amaurotic idiocy, tuberous or diffus cerebral

pseudomigraine,

mb. Niemann-Pick, mb. Little and mb.
Alzheimer.

Among the psychoses the most common have

been schozophrenia, manic-depressive psychosis

or endogenous mental depression, compulsion (|
neurosis, anxiety neurosis or other types of
neurosis, or related abnormalities such as
dyslexia or stuttering.

paralysis agitans, —

Another large group includes psychopathy,
psychopathic or abnormal personalties, often
associated with criminality, alcoholism, asociality, vagrancy, suicide or sexual perversion.

As was to be expected, combined encumbrance
was encountered in a certain percentage of the
cases, often with several affections—as, for
instance, physical malformations together with
epilepsy, oligophrenia or other mental lesions.
Such cases of combined encumbrance may be
very difficult to judge, as no general rule can be
laid down concerning them. Every case has to
be submitted to individual expert estimation.

It is worth while to try to calculate or to
estimate at least the negative selection which
can be effected by genetic-hygienic measures.
Let us see for instance what can be obtained
with regard to mental defectiveness.

As it has been seen from the tables shown
previously a total of about 500-550 persons
are sterilized every year in Denmark, and
of these about 150-200 are mental defectives,
and in addition at least 50-100 are retarded
(dullards or borderline cases).

Most of the persons sterilized in the 25year period (1930-55) were born in IgI0-35.

Some of the children born 1931-50 will
probably be sterilized in the period 1951-70.
From 1931-50 an average of 73,575 children

ere born in Denmark every year. Of these

“children about 730 in each year would have

suffered from hereditary feeble-mindedness

unless eugenic measures had been taken.
‘During the period 1951-70, without sterili
zation, etc., there would have been about
600 persons each year reaching the age of
20, or about 12,000 for the whole period. But
owing to sterilization, etc., there will be a
negative selection of about 50 per cent or more
against feeble-mindedness. About 200 a
year were sterilized and due to induced
abortion on eugenic grounds about one

hundred feeble-minded children will not be
. born.

_ Furthermore, there will be a considerable

sclerosis, cerebral atrophy, mb. Sturge-Weber, negative selection against feeble-mindedness

_ owing to prohibition of marriage, matri‘monial advice and other forms of genetic
counselling, and finally owing to segregation
of individuals in hospitals or other institutions.

On the whole I would consider that the
negative selection against feeble-mindedness
GENETIC-HYGIENIC EXPERIENCES IN DENMARK 17

would be’ considerably more than 50 per
cent, perhaps nearer 100 per cent.

The effect of this negative selection will
depend on the way mental defectiveness is
inherited. Some cases are now hereditary,
some are typically dominant, others typical
recessive and others again follow a more
complicated inheritance. (See Tables 6, 7
and 8.) :

The results are very striking.

(The figures in this table may of course be somewhat

Of 352 children (alive at the examination):

16 children (14:1%) suffered from psychopathy (severe
cases)

50 children (44-2%) suffered from nervous disturbances,
etc.

5 children had I.Q.>>100%

Many varied circumstances, for instance
the mutation frequency, have to be taken
into consideration in judging the effect
of sterilization, etc., on the transmission of
hereditary diseases.

Furthermore there are the effects of
assortative mating, isolates and other factors
active in population genetics.

The effect of the various degrees of negative selection—100 per cent, 50 per cent,
10 per cent, etc.—against dominant and
recessive character-carriers, can be seen from
the respective curves (vide T. Kemp:
Genetics and Disease, 1951, Edinburgh and
London, pages 113-120).

In this connection new knowledge about
the possibility of diagnosing the heterozygotes by recessive diseases may be of importance in the future and the same holds true
with regard to linkage between marker-genes
and hereditary diseases.

The evaluation of the effect of eugenic
measures must take place on the basis of
comprehensive and thorough medico-genetical investigations and _ genetic-hygienic
ascertainment.

Conclusions

To judge from theoretical calculations,
the negative selection, which can be effected
by moderate genetic-hygienic measures, may
probably cause a considerable fall in the
incidence of the hereditary diseases in the
population. This incidence depends, however, on so many different factors that the
stated calculations are of limited value.

A definite opinion on the genetic-hygienic
possibilities can only be formed on the basis
of empirical material. Procuring of such
material requires an epidemiological control
of the serious hereditary diseases in the
18 | THE EUGENICS REVIEW

various populations, carried through for
several generations. We can thereby ascertain whether the hereditary diseases decrease
or increase in frequency, and whether the
genetic-hygienic measures are employed to
a suitable extent and on the diseases where
such are needed.

During the past fifty years or so the study
of heredity, and in particular human genetics, has undergone a development which
has added largely to our knowledge of this
subject. If this development continues the
time draws ‘near when man to an increasing
extent can control his own biological evolution and at the same time command his
environments and conditions of life.

Genetic hygiene, in the form it has
assumed in Denmark during the past few
decades, must be regarded as a precursor,
or perhaps rather as a first stage of this
development.

Genetic hygiene is here based on the
principle of voluntariness, and the population has learned to understand its purpose.
Democratic social conditions prevent misuse
and secure that due consideration is paid
to personal liberty.

The high standard of the public health
service and social care at the same time
constitute a basis for genetic-hygienic measures and are necessary for their effective
application.

Medical genetics in connection with the
associated advice and registration create
the necessary scientific foundation for carrying out measures aimed at preventing

‘hereditary diseases.

The increasing occurrence of artificially
induced mutations during coming years will
make an epidemiological control of the
hereditary diseases in the populations still
more important.
