Family Diseases in N.H.S.

General

Practice

A Second report on the use of the Morbidity Indexing System

[= GENERAL PRACTITIONER in the
National Health Service in Great Britain
has an unrivalled opportunity to study
families and their diseases. National Health
Service patients register with a practitioner who
therefore knows his population at risk. The
N.H.S. records are maintained over the lifetime
of the patients; they follow the patient when he
changes his doctor.

We have previously discussed the reasons for
undertaking family studies of disease in the
N.H.S. and have described a simple method of
family morbidity indexing.*

Our interest in family morbidity recording
was encouraged by the results of an investigation
comparing the information received through our
indexing system with the family history given in
hospital records of a group of women patients
with duodenal ulcer. The general practice index
yielded a higher proportion of cases with a
positive family history than the corresponding
records of a Teaching Hospital Department
specially interested in the condition for which
the patient was admitted.

We now discuss some studies carried out, or
under way, since our earlier report in 1961.
Some of these studies form part of a special
analysis of duodenal ulcer and related diseases.
Other studies arose out of requests from individual departments, other G.Ps., or from special
research groups for information about diseases
recorded in our family index.

The age/sex composition of the practice has

* A Preliminary Report. THE EUGENICS REVIEW, 1961.
52, 225.

been determined for the calculation of prevalence rates. We have also examined the composition of the practice in terms of households
and three-generation families and have examined
the movements of patients on and off the list by
age and in relation to specific diseases. We found
that although the practice population was that
of a housing estate with many young families
and with a high rate of turnover, family recording was much more complete than might be
expected.

The following diseases and conditions have
been studied: duodenal and gastric ulcer, chronic
bronchitis, bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis
and osteoarthritis, psychoneurosis, psychosis,
suicide (including attempted suicide), chronic
alcoholism, mental defect, mental deficiency,
drug addiction, epilepsy, migraine, varicose
veins, diabetes, thyrotoxicosis, myxoedema and
cretinism, coronary thrombosis, psoriasis,
hypertension, congential malformations and
abnormalities. For the purpose of this report we
present, from these investigations, features to
illustrate the potential contribution of family
doctor recording to many medical problems,
and a new way of studying morbidity.

We have examined the association of diseases
in the same patient. Some of the associations
were fortuitous, reflecting the overlap of common conditions. For example, among 556
patients between 20 and 69 years with duodenal
ulcer, 33 or 5-4 per cent also had arthritis. Yet
this was no more than the number to be expected
on the basis of the age/sex prevalence rates for
the entire practice of the seven partners of
approximately 19,000 patients.

Of both male and female patients with chronic
bronchitis in the age group 20-44, more were
found to suffer from psychoneurosis than actually
the number expected from its prevalence in the
respective age groups of the total practice.
Whether this is to be explained by the excessive
smoking of the psychoneurotic, leading to
chronic bronchitis, or to some other factor, is
still to be determined.

When examining the group of psychoneurosis
recorded patients, we noted the frequency of
attempted suicide—10 per cent. This stands as a
grave warning that it is not wise to ignore the
neurotic patients’ threat that they will attempt
to commit suicide.

The association between duodenal ulcer and
chronic respiratory disease was found to be not

22

accidental and accords with the results reported
from other workers.?

It should be stated that the diagnostic criteria
for coding the diseases discussed, were:

1. D.U.: X-ray or laparotomy confirmation.

2. Psychosis or psychoneurosis: consultant psy
chiatrist confirmation.

3. Chronic bronchitis: the M.R.C. definition.

4. Rheumatoid arthritis: diagnosis corroborated

by serum and X-ray studies.

5. Epilepsy: those treated for epilepsy.

The method of indexing diseases should
provide a reasonable guide to the prevalence of
those diseases in which permanent cure is rare or
absent. The figures for chronic respiratory
disease derived from the practice index were
found to be close to the prevalence rates reported.
in population surveys carried out by the Medical
Research Council’s Pneumoconiosis Research
Unit—approximately 11 per cent of men aged
55-64 years and equally so in the other age
groups of both sexes.

Diseases with intermittent symptoms and
variable diagnostic criteria cannot be expected to
yield figures comparable with those of other
studies. The group of conditions labelled
“epilepsy” for example, were recorded in the
practice with same overall frequency as that
reported for a group of English general practices:
8-7 per 1,000 against 7-8 for males and 6-7
against 8-0 per 1,000 for females. They did not,
however, show the same age/sex pattern.?

Duodenal ulcer, a condition with firmer diagnostic criteria, although found with a frequency
greater than that reported in one of the principal
population studies,* was found to have an age
and sex prevalence very close to that published
for another general practice in Edinburgh.®

For those diseases where no special population
studies had been made elsewhere, the General
Practice Morbidity Enquiries of the College of
General Practitioners and the Registrar General
provide the only comparison.* The latter, in
giving figures only of the annual number of
patients and the annual number of consultations
for a specific disease, inevitably understates the
number of patients who may suffer from a
chronic disease without consulting their doctor.
This understatement is noted in comparing (agestandardized) rates of patients consulting per
annum with the prevalence figures from the family

index for three diseases. (Epilepsy, psoriasis,
and the group “myxoedema and cretinism.”’)

The ramifications of families and households
traced through the index system are illustrated
in Figures 3, 4 and 5, which show the recorded
morbidity for

1. a chronic illness family in general.

2. an epilepsy family.

3. a psoriasis family.

The information obtained without our recording system is also indicated in the family tree
diagrams.

The study of diseases in parents and their
children may be usefully made from the index
by selecting a group of parents with a record of
disease, tracing their single and married children,
whether still living with them or not, by means of
the family cross-reference system. The same
family’s morbidity index may then be consulted
to show the recorded diseases in these children.
The recording of diseases in parents and children
have here not been established by questioning the
relatives, but have been indexed in the routine
clinical practice. A common source of bias is thus
avoided. |

In studying the prevalence of a specific disease
in the children of parents with that disease, the
family index can also be used to pick other
diseases in parents and children to emphasize
contrasts or similarities.

In the following tables, the expected and actual
number of sons and daughters of parents with
an index illness have been assembled. Once
again, the “expected numbers” have been calculated on the basis of the age/sex rates for the
practice as a whole.

In this table the prevalence of bronchitis in the
daughters of chronic bronchitics requires further
study, being nearly three times the expected
number. In contrast to this, there is no excess of

24

chronic bronchitis when the parent has been
recorded with psychoneurosis. This is to be
expected.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

This table makes it quite clear that if a parent
has a duodenal ulcer he or she is much more
likely to have a child who suffers from a duodenal
ulcer. Moreover, the excess of incidence over the
number expected is surprisingly more marked
among the daughters.

Whether this is a genetic influence or one of
environment cannot be discussed here, but these
tables clearly illustrate how the family morbidity
indexing can isolate the problem.

The difficulty in interpreting the findings of
our studies is equally well demonstrated by the
analysis of duodenal ulcer patients who have
also a psychoses or psychoneurosis. The sex
differences are particularly remarkable among
the larger group of duodenal ulcer patients with
psychoneurosis. The difficulty is, which comes
first ?

the N.H.S. record to the solution of this group
of problems is illustrated in Table 7.

Whether there is a genetic link in the male
between psychoses and/or ducdenal ulcer only
further studies can reveal.

Husbands and wives may have the same
disease or different but related diseases. Illness
in one spouse may lead, through mental or
physical stress to disease in the other; through
the direct effect of infection, or the indirect effect
of selective mating. The possible contribution of

26

None of these differences is striking and this
underlines the need for caution and detailed
study.

Some of the social implications of diseases can
also be readily studied by simple analysis of the
family index without any special inquiry of a
group of patients; for example, it can be showhe
that epileptic patients can and do marry anca
have unaffected families. 1

Of these 56 marriages, only four had epileptic

offspring.

By relating administrative records of persons
leaving the practice it is possible to see whether
patients with a particular disease leave more
commonly than other patients. This is frequently
an unknown source of bias in epidemiological
inquiries. It was found for example, that among
men and women patients with D.U. (aged
20-44) 8-8 per cent out of 227 had left the
practice during 1961. The proportion of comparable patients with psychoneurosis who left
the practice during the same period is 4-6 per
cent, contrary to expectation.

Another type of analysis examines consultations recorded on N.H.S. records for families
where a certain disease is present. For example
we wished to discover whether the children of
parents with clinical hypertension or the sibs of
such patients had a higher than average incidence
of the same or associated disease. In order to
obtain preliminary evidence that this method
was worth attempting, we compared the annual
consultations of the children of hypertensives
with consultations of the children of nonhypertensive controls matched for age and sex
and household composition. In a pilot study

there was a suggestion that the daughters of
hypertensives consulted more frequently than
the control group daughters. The age structure
of the practice made it impossible to study the
sibs of hypertensive patients in sufficiently large
numbers at the present time. This is an example
of a temporary limitation in analysis which will
vanish with the ageing of the practice.

Conclusion

Since the Morbidity Indexing by Families has
been set up it has been fully confirmed that this
system can be kept up to date for the day-to-day
requirements of general practice. The annual
incidence of diseases recorded can be obtained
quite as readily as the prevalence. The advantages
of this familial morbidity pattern being available
to the partners in the Practice has been confirmed on many occasions. The examples given
demonstrate the wide scope of the studies that
can be and are being undertaken from routine
general practice clinica] recording.
