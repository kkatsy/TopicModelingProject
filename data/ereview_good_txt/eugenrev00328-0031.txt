THE RELATION OF TEMPERAMENT
TO SIZE OF FAMILY.

By May FREEMAN.

It is a fact familiar to everyone that the average size of the family
has been decreasing for many years in this country. The suggestion
has often been made that there is some relation between the number in
the family and the temperament of the children. In particular it has
been suggested that the larger the family the more cheerful are the’
children ; the explanation offered is that an upbringing in a ‘young’
atmosphere is conducive to cheerfulness. It seems worth while
attempting to test this suggestion in view of the hold which the small
family system is gaining upon all sections of the population. A small!
investigation was therefore planned and carried out in a northern
industrial area. While, as will appear, the results are by no means
conclusive, they may prove of interest to other workers in the same
field.

The method employed was as follows. Children aged from five to
ten attending elementary schools were classified by their teachers into
two groups, the more and the less cheerful. At the same time particulars were obtained regarding the number in the family. Data were
collected in four schools to begin with. The results seemed to be of
sufficient interest to warrant the collection of further data and three
more schools were added making seven in all. The total number of
children regarding whom particulars were obtained was 1805. The
investigation was restricted to children of the ages mentioned because it
was thought that into the lives of children above these ages many more
influences enter, some of which might obscure the effect, if any, that
size of family has upon temperament.

The head teachers of all the schools except one were seen personally
by me. In the case of this one school directions were given by correspondence. The object of the enquiry was explained to the head
teachers at the outset, but was withheld from the junior teachers
until the data had been collected. The junior teachers were asked to
divide their children into two groups, the more cheerful and the less
cheerful. It was clearly explained that ‘‘cheerfulness’ was not ‘alertness,’ ‘brightness’ or ‘cleverness’ but rather ‘happiness.’ Pains were
taken to ensure that the basis of the classification was clearly understood. The justification of the use of teachers’ estimates of intelligence
or of temperament is to be found in the results of the now numerous
170 EUGENICS REVIEW.

enquiries which have shown a high degree of correlation between
estimates so made and measurements carried out by other methods.

The teachers also ascertained the number in the family by questioning the children. By ‘number in the family’ is meant all living
children. The errors involved by this method of collecting the data
are probably not as large as might perhaps be expected. Owing to the
shortage of houses there is less moving from district to district than
formerly and in consequence the teachers gain an intimate knowledge of
the circumstances of their children. I was present on many occasions
when the teachers were obtaining this information, and I was much impressed with the extent of their knowledge, as often shown by the fact
that they detected errors in the accounts given by the children of the
composition of their families. It was thought better not to attempt to
obtain the number of children living at home and to exclude those
living away for two reasons. Though away at the time of the enquiry
these members of the family would in many cases have been recently
living at home and so adding to the family circle. To omit them would
on that account lead to more errors than it would correct. Further
these absent members have influenced the home and the parents in
the past and in some cases do still influence them directly to some
extent.

The results of the enquiry are summed up in three tables. The
first four schools are lettered A to D and the last three X to Z. Table 1
shows the percentage of ‘cheerful’ children in families of different size.

The general impression gained by an examination of the table is
that there is a higher percentage of cheerful children in families of
medium size than in large families, whereas the very small families
stand in an intermediate position. Table 2 shows the distribution of
cheerful children according to size of family. This table gives the same
impression as before. In Table 3 an attempt is made to submit the
figures to a more accurate analysis. It shows the difference in the

percentage of cheerful children in families of four or less and five or
more and also the probable error of the differences in the different

schools.
It will be observed from Table 2 that the proportion of cheerful
children to all children varies considerably from school to school.

It might be suggested that the character of the building would be
reflected in the temperament of the children. It is true that the
schools in this area differ markedly from one another, some buildings
being gloomy and others bright. Since, however, both school A,
which, among the first four schools contains the largest proportion of
cheerful children, and school B, which contains the smallest proportion
of such children, were both housed in buildings that were old and
gloomy, it does not seem likely that any weight is to be attributed to
this factor. It is possible that to some extent the temperament of the
head teachers may influence the children, but it is unlikely that this is
so to any large extent. It is much more probable that different
standards of cheerfulness have been adopted by the teachers in different
schools. This is to some extent a disturbing factor, but it does not
vitiate the results because, whatever standard was adopted, it was
applied irrespective of the numbers in the family.

The impression gained from the first two tables, that families of
four or less are more cheerful than families of five or more, is examined
in Table 8.

{[*This school was exceptional in showing a higher percentage of cheerful
children in the larger families.]

It will be seen that the differences between small and large families,
as thus defined, are certainly not significant for schools A, X and Z.
The difference is in the region of significance in school B; it is barely so
in C, D, and Y. If, however, it is justifiable to combine the figures
of the different schools, we are dealing with much larger numbers so that.
the probable error decreases and the difference then appears to be significant.

When it is asked what conclusions, if any, can be drawn from
this investigation, it must first be remembered that the methods employed were somewhat rough and ready both as regards the estimate of
‘cheerfulness’ and the ascertainment of numbers in the family. Bearing this in mind, it does not appear that there is any marked relation
between cheerfulness and size of family. The indication is that smaller
families are more cheerful than large families defining a small family as
one containing four or less children. If this is so, then either the
influence of many young children playing together, being brought up
together, of a ‘young’ environment in fact, does not make for cheerfulness, as is often supposed, or its influence is overborn or counteracted by
other factors. Before asking what other factors there may be, it should
be pointed out that the children attending elementary schools pass
much of their time in the streets playing with children of other families,
and that, in fact, in this sphere of life, an only child may be less cut off
from companionship than appears at first sight. It might be interesting to extend the enquiry to boys at public schools whose opportunity
to mix with other children is much more strictly confined to members
of their own families. In any case it cannot be taken for granted that
the influence of young companionship is much less among those of the
children included in this investigation who come from small families
than it is in the case of those who come from large families.

What other factors may there be which bear with different intensity upon children from families of different size? It is probable that.
the parents of the smaller families are on the whole those in the better
social and economic position and it is possible that since cheerfulness is.
an asset in life, they owe their position to some extent to the possession.
THE RELATION OF TEMPERAMENT. 178

of innate predisposition towards cheerfulness which they have passed
on to their children. This is a possibility not to be disregarded. It is
certain, however, that, where the family is large, there is a greater
strain upon the family resources. The recent investigations of Mr.
Rowntree and others have shown how great the pressure is when there
are a number of children in the family under school-leaving age. Inadequate food and clothing are more common in large than in small
families and the parents in such families must themselves suffer more
from worry and anxiety. Conditions in large families among workpeople can hardly tend to cheerfulness and may well counteract the
cheerful influence of a young environment, if indeed, as is doubtful,
there is any considerable difference between the large and small
families of workpeople in this respect.

In conclusion, I should like to express my thanks to Mr. D. Caradog
Jones for the assistance which he has given me in the preparation of this

paper.
