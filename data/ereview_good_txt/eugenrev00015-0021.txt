The Study of Mutation and Selection
in Human Populations’

INTEREST IN THE genetics of human populations may be either of an historical or of a
predictive kind. That is to say, most population
genetic studies relate fairly directly to one or
other of two sorts of question, namely ‘“‘How
did we get this way?” and ‘“‘Where are we
heading?” Both emphases imply a certain
amount of interpretation and speculation, but
both have served to stimulate the gathering of
relevant empirical data of quite non-speculative
kinds. In view of the sponsorship of the present
lecture by the Eugenics Society, and the special
association with the name of Galton, it will
deal primarily with the second of these two
questions.

To those investigators who are concerned
with current genetic trends and their long-term
consequences, the large amount of information
about people which is gathered routinely for a
variety of purposes in modern societies may serve
either as a special spur or, because of the
immensity and relative inaccessibility of the
resulting accumulation of facts, as a major source
of discouragement. The difference depends
on the view taken of the respective magnitudes
of the difficulties as compared with the opportunities for extracting from the existing documentation genetic facts of the kinds needed for
the more important sorts of human population
studies.

The opportunities are of course substantial,
even if as yet largely unrealized, because for no
organism other than man have the facts of
procreation and family composition, and of
mortality and morbidity, been so minutely
documented over such large populations.
Furthermore, in no experiment with laboratory

mammals is it even remotely conceivable that
so much money and effort could ever be spent
identifying the natures and causes of deviations
from physical and mental well being, and social
adjustment, as is done in any advanced human
society.

A major part of the resulting documentation
is, in fact, relevant to studies of those influences
which operate to alter the collective germplasm,
or pool of genetic material, and which therefore
determine the hereditary basis of health and
well being of future generations. However,
genetic studies are, virtually by definition,
family studies; and the biggest barrier to the
use of much of the enormous body of recorded
facts about people for any sort of genetic
research lies in the difficulty of relating, or
linking, these facts to the family histories of
the persons concerned.

The present account will deal with the nature
of the information needed for studies of current
genetic trends, and with the ways that may be
used to extract and apply such information.
As we proceed, the difficulties will seem to loom
larger. And yet, to admit to the possibility
that we may never know in any substantial
detail what changes are in fact taking place in
the gene pool, and what factors are potent in
influencing these changes for better or worse,
would seem quite improper until we get much
closer than we are now to exhausting the
information that is already potentially at our
disposal.

The Nature of Population Genetics

The kinds of information that are required
may best be understood by considering for a
moment the changes that take place, over a

109

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

single generation cycle, in the collective germ
plasm of which each generation is, in turn, the
temporary custodian.

The diversity of hereditary characteristics
represented at the outset owes its presence to
past events of mutation, that is of de novo
hereditary changes, and also, if one thinks of a
population less than that of the world as a
whole, of migration into the population of
genetically diverse people. Such occurrences, in
each generation, contribute further to the genetic
diversity that has been already accumulated
over the past.

The outward expressions of the resulting
heterogeneity within the collective pool of
genes are only in part determined by the external
environment; just as important are the so-called
patterns of mating among the immediate
ancestors of the generation under observation.
If marriages were to occur in a strictly random
fashion between members of various population
subgroups, the effect would be a blending of
many widely different inheritances, so as to
obscure much of the hereditary diversity present
in the gene pool. In practice however, matings
tend, in varying degrees, to occur preferentially
within the various population subgroups, as
based on family relationships, religious affiliations, ethnic origins and economic circumstances.
There is in addition a measurable tendency for
persons of similar physical and mental characteristics to marry one another. The effect of
these inbreedings and assortative matings, when
they occur, is to provide increased opportunity
for outward expression of the genetic diversity
inherent in the collected inheritance. An
extended range of phenotypes is thus subjected
to the tests of survival and procreation.

The composition of the gene pool of the next
generation depends, of course, upon the selective
effects of the differences in mortality and fertility
or, in other words, upon what kinds of people
reproduce, and how much. Selection does not
operate directly upon the genes, to favour or
suppress the propagation of one as compared
with an alternative gene. Rather, it is the
phenotypes or outward expressions, which are
in part determined by the genes but which are
also frequently influenced by the environments
as well, that are ‘“‘selected”’ on the basis of their

110

abilities to survive and reproduce. Genes that
show a tendency to be associated with phenotypes of high selective value will, as a result,
be transmitted preferentially to the gene pool
of the next generation.

From all this it is apparent that human
population genetics is concerned with a relatively
small number of major phenomena, notably
mutation, migration, mating patterns and
selection. For the study of any of these, family
histories or pedigrees are an essential requirement and the more of such histories that can be
marshalled the better.

The point I wish to emphasize at this juncture
is that the basic pedigree information is
accurately recorded on a continuing basis as
part of the vital statistics systems of most
countries, and is essentially complete for all
who remain within the registration areas. These
systems also record our geographic and racial
origins, religious affiliations and occupations;
and if other routine records such as the census
enumeration forms, income tax returns and so
on are regarded as further potential sources,
the documentation of our social characteristics
is more complete still. Similarly, our physical
and mental attributes are recorded in even
greater detail, partly because of our demands
for medical and health services, but in other
ways as well, as in the case of records of school
performance, enlistment in the armed services,
and of unemployment, crime and delinquency.

Such documentation is in most instances
tied to the names of the individuals concerned
so that, in principle at least, virtually all of it
could be integrated with the family pedigrees.
Of all the recorded information, however, the
most fundamentally important is that which
serves to identify immediate relatives, and
which is contained in the vital records systems
in a form that makes possible the compilation
on a Statistical scale of histories of marriage,
procreation and death in individual families.
Thus we already possess much of what is needed
for detailed and precise studies of fertility
differences, mating patterns and so on, and the
scope and reliability of the documentation is
increasing continuously.

Access to such information is not always
simple. Use of some of the records is restricted
THE STUDY OF MUTATION AND SELECTION IN HUMAN POPULATIONS

by law, and in most instances it is limited by
the sheer magnitude of the files. In addition,
there are organizational and technical problems
of interrelating, on any substantial scale, the
facts contained in two or more independently
derived records pertaining to the same person
or family.

For such reasons, major advances in the use
for research purposes of any substantial fraction
of the potentially available information are not
to be expected in a hurry; but modest developments are in progress now, and some early
products of one of these, relating particularly
to mutation and selection will be described.

Pedigrees from Record Linkage

The study from which these products have
been derived relates to the Canadian province
of British Columbia, with a current population
of 1-7 million, in which about 10,000 marriages
and 40,000 births occur annually. A ten-year
marriage file (1946-55) and a six-year birth file
(1952-58) have been used. In addition, there are
records of stillbirths over the same six-year
period, and of child deaths, together with
registrations of handicaps among children born
in this period, provided by the exceedingly well
run British Columbia Registry of Handicapped
Children and Adults.

By methods that have been described fully
elsewhere, 5, 9, 10,11 these registrations have
been integrated into the form of family histories,
starting in each instance with the marriage
record (where this is present in the files),
followed by those of any procreations arising
out of the marriage, and with the records of
handicaps and deaths among offspring of the
married couples interpolated behind the birth
records of the children to which they relate.
Somewhat over 200,000 records are currently
in use, and the integrated files will in due course
be extended backward to 1946 and forward to
include current records as they become available.

The technology is now well developed, and
the actual merging and linking operation in
which current records are used to update the
family groupings on an existing master file can
be carried out by an electronic computer
exceedingly rapidly and economically.

Mutations

One of the applications of the record linkage
technology which I propose to discuss in detail
has to do with the possibility of detecting and
measuring the consequences of recurrent mutations in the human germ plasm. Most of the
genes which arise from these mutational events
are believed, with considerable reason, to be
harmful; and in recent years much thought has
been given to the possible importance of such
artificially induced increases in mutation rate
as must almost certainly result from exposures
of human reproductive tissues to man-made
radiation.

The problem has substantial financial overtones, because upper limits to the exposures of
whole populations from the future peaceful uses
of atomic energy are being suggested now by an
authoritative body.!5 There is, as a result,
considerable pressure on individual geneticists
to assess the likely consequences of the mutations that would arise in human populations
from given radiation exposures, even where the
amount of the harm cannot be judged to within
an order of magnitude or so in either direction.

Such estimates of genetic damage from
artificially induced mutations are unlikely to
attain increased precision until more is known
of the importance of the mutations that occur
anyway as a result of natural causes. Some
fraction of the current burden of hereditary
ill health and handicap, and possibly a substantial fraction of it, is believed to be maintained in the population by repeated mutations
of natural origin.

There has been a tendency on the part of
geneticists in the past to concentrate on studies
of mutation frequencies at particular gene loci
which control striking and readily scorable
characteristics, such as achondroplasticdwarfism,
the heritable eye cancer known as retinoblastoma
and the conspicuous nerve tumours of von
Recklinghausen’s disease or multiple neurofibromatosis, to take a few examples. Although
the results of such studies are often quoted,
they are essentially disappointing for present
purposes, not because of any of the inherent
imprecisions, but rather because they relate to
a small and quite unrepresentative group of

111
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

mutant traits and indicate little indeed concerning the possible importance of mutations
throughout the total complement of gene loci.

There is at least one other approach to the
detection of the consequences of mutation
throughout the genome as a whole. If mutations
or mutagenic influences accumulate during the
reproductive life spans of individuals, genetically
determined harm might be detectably increased
in offspring from older parents. This suggestion,
which was made originally by Penrose 14 and
Sonneborn,!6 was in fact later borne out in
the case of one quite striking hereditary disease,
namely mongolian idiocy or Down’s syndrome,
the risk of which is greatly elevated among
offspring from mothers who are approaching
the end of the reproductive period. The
mutation that determines this condition, however, involves not just an alteration of a single
gene, but rather a gross chromosomal change
consisting usually of the incorporation of an
additional chromosome over and above the
normal number. Nevertheless, other similar but
less striking increases in the risks of various
hereditary conditions with advancing maternal
or paternal ages have been interpreted as
probably due to increased incidences of
particular gene mutations in gametes from older
mothers and fathers.

I should like at this stage to mention certain
difficulties in the use of the approach that
may perhaps make the early applications of it
seem, at first sight, lighthearted indeed, but
which should not be taken to imply that we must
forever forgo knowledge of the consequences of
mutation, or that the approach should be
abandoned in favour of some superior alternative when in fact there may be none.

The first difficulty relates to the availability
of suitable empirical data. The early observations were based on quite limited ascertainments
of the parental age distributions for children
with various genetic disorders, and the control
data related to populations that were not
necessarily representative of those from which
the cases were drawn, and which could have
differed substantially in the distributions of
parental ages at birth. Such limitations of the
data arise from essentially artificial causes, in
that very substantial numbers of affected

112

children are known to exist and the necessary
parental age information is almost universally
recorded in the birth registrations. The difficulty
of securing the necessary data arises only
because the two sorts of information relating
to a particular individual tend to be recorded
independently on separate documents of quite
different kinds, both of which may at some
later date be effectively buried in massive files
of accumulated records. As will be seen later,
other facts needed for the study of mutation by
means of this approach are likewise recorded
but tend to be inaccessible for the same reason,
and may remain so unless economical means
are used to interrelate, on a substantial scale,
specific by individual, the information contained
in various large, independently derived files.

Our own studies of parental age correlations
have been based on registrations of live births,
stillbirths, handicaps and deaths among just
over 200,000 children born in British Columbia
during 1953-58, of whom more than 12,000
were registered either as stillborn, handicapped
or as having died by the end of 1959. Record
linkage techniques were employed which make
use of computers to merge the parental ages
and birth orders from the birth records, with
the diagnoses from the handicap and death
records of the same individuals. Although larger
amounts of data were derived in this manner
than have been analyzed in previous studies, the
results must be regarded as modest in comparison with those that may be obtained
through applications of similar methods on a
continuing basis to these and other files of vital
and health records. Furthermore, the most
important objective of the study is judged to
be the continuing development and testing of
methods by which such information may be
more fully utilized in the future.

The results serve, however, to illustrate the
kinds of effect on risks to the offspring, that are
not causally related to the advancing age of the
father or mother, but are only secondarily
associated with parental age, and which therefore
must be carefully distinguished if the approach
is to be used at all to study the consequences of
mutation. Some of these secondary associations
will tend to obscure the effects of mutations;
others will tend to simulate or mimic them.
THE STUDY OF MUTATION AND SELECTION IN HUMAN POPULATIONS

In the former category (i.e. those which tend
to obscure) are the special risks to firstborn
offspring and to offspring of very young mothers,
which fortunately can be distinguished from
one another by suitable statistical methods. A
whole group of diseases peculiar to early infancy,
and in particular the intracranial and spinal
injuries at birth, have about twice the frequency
among firstborn as compared with secondborn
children, when effects of maternal age differences
are removed (Table 1). Similarly, children of
very young mothers, age nineteen and under,
are about twice as prone to a wide variety of
conditions, which include intracranial and spinal
injuries at birth and postnatal asphyxia, as are
children of mothers in the next five-year age
group (Table 1); this is true even when effects
of birth order differences are removed (for an
example of the method for removing the effect
of one variable or the other, see Table 2).

More serious for present purposes are the
effects that can mimic those of increased mutation frequencies with advancing parental ages.
Not surprisingly, the infective and parasitic
diseases (notably tuberculosis and polio) tend
to be more common among children of birth
orders three and over, the same being true of
postnatal asphyxia (Table 1). As a result, these
conditions exhibit a parental age effect that is
in reality secondary to the birth order effect.
An environmental factor is almost certainly
involved, since for both sorts of condition the
effect of birth order is most striking when the
mother is young (for an example, see Table 3).
Possibly this is because the pregnancies have
been closely spaced, or because of crowding in
the home, or perhaps because the mothers who
have had many children while still very young
tend to be from a socio-economic group in
which the risks of such conditions are high.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

To distinguish between these alternatives, further
information about the social circumstances and
the reproductive histories of the families would
be needed, much of which is already documented
in the vital registrations, census enumerations
and elsewhere. There is no certainty, of course,
that genetic factors play any substantial role
in the causation of these particular conditions,
but the examples serve nevertheless to illustrate

the ways in which biases can arise. Similar
interactions appear to be quite common (Table 4)..

Of less obvious origins are the increased risks
of strabismus, or “squint”, and of certain
“other” congenital malformations of the nervous
system and sense organs among children of
higher birth orders (Table 1) which might, if
birth orders were not taken into consideration
in the analysis, appear as maternal age effects

of kinds that would mimic the consequences of
mutations accumulating in the female germ
cells. Genetic causes of another sort might
conceivably be involved, since maternal/foetal
incompatibilities could very well be operating
to increase the likelihood of sensitization of
mothers of higher parities, thereby increasing the risks to offspring of higher birth
orders. Such effects would not, of course,
indicate any influence of parental ageing as
such.

Of the increased risks shown to be associated
primarily with advancing age of mother, that
of mongolian idiocy is known already to be
mutational in origin, while that of cerebral
palsy could perhaps be attributed to the changes
in intra-uterine environment that occur in older
mothers. Evidence to rule out such an effect
of the prenatal environment is not wholly unobtainable, but would require another generation
of pedigree information to permit comparison
of the risks in the current generation of children
for different ages of the maternal grandmother
where the mother’s age is not a variable. No
one has seriously attempted to carry out such
multi-generation comparisons on any substantial scale as relating to particular diseases
or groups of diseases, although data have been
obtained on correlations of the grandmaternal
age with the sex ratio, of a kind indicating
possible differences in prenatal mortality due to
lethal mutation in the sex chromosomes.2
Extensions of the approach to include mortality
and morbidity of children, specific by disease
or broad category of disease, would require
application of pedigree information of a kind

ER—I

that is already contained in the accumulated
vital records of most countries, but on a scale
that would heretofore have seemed impracticable
in the extreme.

Observed correlations of risks with advancing
age of the father at the time of the birth, independent of the mother’s age, cannot, of
course, be attributed in the above manner to a
changing intra-uterine environment, but other
difficulties of interpretation present themselves.
One such correlation, involving the risk of
congenital malformation, and more particularly
the group of such conditions known in the
International Classification as other congenital
malformations of the nervous system and sense
organs, might perhaps be genuinely indicative
of increased mutant frequencies in gametes
from ageing fathers (Table 1). However, a
similarly increased risk of diseases of the
respiratory system (mainly deaths from pneumonia and bronchitis) which has been observed
among Offspring from older fathers seems quite
unlikely to be mutational in origin (Tables 1
and 5). A relatively simple explanation is in
this instance apparent from examination of the
data; most of the deaths from respiratory
diseases among British Columbia children occur
in North American Indians, and Indian fathers
tend to be older than is usual for the rest of
the population. The correlation disappears
when the data are broken down by Indian versus
non-Indian parentage.

Findings of this sort emphasize the importance
of distinguishing those correlations with paternal
or with maternal age that are secondary in
nature, and that depend on differences in the

115
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

parental age distribution for population subgroups within which the risks may be higher
or lower than for the population as a whole.
The principal limiting factor in the identification
of such non-mutational effects is not the amount
of recorded knowledge of social characteristics,
which is really quite extensive. Rather, it is the
mechanical difficulty of bringing together such
recorded information, as relating to particular
individuals, and of doing so on a large enough
scale to permit multiple breakdown of the data
without spreading them too thinly between the
resulting pigeon-holes or matrix cells.

To complicate matters still further, the extent
of the difference between the age of the father

and that of the mother, is itself correlated with
the risk of infant death (Table 6), an effect which
is presumably likewise associated with population heterogeneities involving simultaneously the
ages of the parents and the risks to the children.
This relatively long list of the difficulties that
besets attempts to derive information about the
importance of mutation from studies of parental
age correlations may at first sight seem discouraging in the extreme. And yet, it is doubtful
if there are any better approaches, and we are
still in the happy position of having potentially
available to us a vastly greater body of recorded
personal information, of strictly relevant kinds,
than anyone has so far attempted to analyze.

THE STUDY OF MUTATION AND SELECTION IN HUMAN POPULATIONS

Selection

Some part of the hereditary causes of disease
is, of course, maintained in the population, not
by repeated mutation but by selection; that is
by differences in fertility and mortality that
operate in some circumstances to favour the
perpetuation of genes which in other settings
are the cause of ill health or handicap. To those
investigators who are especially concerned with
estimation of the consequences of artificially
induced increases in the mutation rate, it is
important to make full use of any information
which will serve to identify those conditions
that are maintained in the population by selective
forces, and to distinguish them from those that
are maintained by repeated mutations. To
others who are concerned with all of the various
influences that may affect the future quality
of the gene pool, it is important to be able to
identify the social and other factors that alter
the directions in which the selective forces
operate.

Precision in detecting differences of fertility
and mortality depends to a major degree on the
quality and accuracy of the available pedigree
information. The identifications of family relationships contained in the vital registration
systems are almost universal in their extent,
covering as they do whole populations, and
they are substantially more reliable than similar
information which has been derived by personal
interview or questionnaire. Because of this
unique precision of the family information from
the vital records, the most interesting early
products of genetic studies employing record
linkage methods relate to the detection of
deviations from normal fertility and mortality
displayed by families in which certain diseases
and handicaps of possible genetic interest have
occurred; or, in other words, to the study of
selection pressures as associated with major
causes of ill health.

The investigations of this kind that have been
carried out using the vital records have been
modest in size and have not as yet made full
use of electronic data processing methods. They
serve two purposes at this stage, to demonstrate
that information on selection can be obtained
from the vital registration system, and to give

some hint of the kinds of empirical findings that
are likely to come out of future applications of
the approach to larger files and to a wider
range of diseases.

The particular selection studies which will
be described were prompted by a current belief
that the Rh-negative gene is kept in the population by a tendency on the part of mothers of
infants who die of erythroblastosis to ‘‘compensate”’ for their losses by having another child
sooner than would otherwise be the case. If there
is such a tendency, it is altogether likely that
mothers also compensate in the same fashion for
early infant deaths of other kinds, and that the
phenomenon may be quite widespread.

Reproductive performances of mothers were
therefore studied following stillbirths, infant
deaths from a number of different causes and
also following the births of mongoloid idiots
who did not die. Comparisons have in each
case been made with the reproductive histories
of mothers of similar ages and parities who
were not so selected (Figure 1).

There are distinct advantages in being able
to use the whole of a birth population as a
control in a study of this kind. Approximately
170,000 birth records were available on magnetic
tape representing the five-year period 1954-58.
Each record of a birth in 1954, of which there
were about 35,000, was used to initiate searches
by computer for other births to the same mother
in that year and in each of the subsequent
years. This was a major undertaking, even with
the help of a computer, and the total of over
170,000 searches (i.e. 35,000 per year over the
five-year period) took eighty hours on a now
obsolete machine (Burroughs 205). However,
with the more recent machines now in use, two
to three hours would be sufficient.

Mothers of stillborn children, in fact exhibited
reproductive compensation, but only over a
brief period. During the first twelve months
following the stillbirth, between two and three
times as many subsequent births took place
to these mothers as would be expected in view
of their ages and the numbers of children which
they already had.11 Over the second year their
collective reproductive performances were about
average, while in the third and fourth years
these declined to about 70 and 60 per cent of

117
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

normal. Taking the reproductive histories over
the whole four-year period mothers of stillborn
children tended to be less fertile than other
mothers of the same ages and parities.

Similar studies of conditions other than
stillbirth have been carried out more recently.

Mothers of children registered as dying of
erythroblastosis, for example, have shown no
tendency to compensate for their losses, the
observed number of later born children being
almost exactly the number expected of them
(Table 7). This does not necessarily mean that
compensation has not taken place at some
period in the past, and perhaps even up to the

time when the hereditary nature of the condition
came to be generally recognized, but there is
certainly no evidence from the present study that
it is still occurring.

The same may be said of mothers of children
dying of haemorrhagic disease of the newborn
although, for this condition, knowledge of the
cause would be less of a deterrent to further
reproduction (Table 8). The observed number
of later born children was again almost exactly
what would be expected.

Not all of the conditions studied, however,
failed in this manner to be associated with
reproductive compensation, and for deaths from

postnatal asphyxia, which is often associated
with failure of the lungs to expand at birth,
the effect is striking. From the ninety-seven
mothers of affected children, instead of the
expected sixty-six later born children, there
were 111, anexcess of nearly 70 per cent (Table 9).

Consideration of some of the possible causes
of such an association serves to illustrate the
complexities that are introduced into selection
studies whenever environmental factors may be
involved. From the standpoint of the mother,

the loss of a child from postnatal asphyxia is
probably not so very different from having a
stillborn child, or from the death of a child
shortly after birth from erythroblastosis or
haemorrhagic disease. It seems unlikely, therefore, that the effects on her reproductive
behaviour will be strikingly different in the case
of postnatal asphyxia. The true reason for the
association with an elevated fertility might
therefore be that his latter condition tends to
occur preferentially in an unusually fertile subgroup of the population.

This view is supported in the case of postnatal
asphyxia by evidence from the parental age
and birth order studies discussed earlier. The
risk was shown to be substantially elevated

among children of very young mothers when
contributions from birth order effects were
excluded, and also among children of higher

birth orders when contributions from maternal
age effects were removed (Tables 1 and 3).
This seemingly paradoxical relationship is easier
to visualize when one considers that maternal

119
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

age and birth order interact in such a way as
to exaggerate the risk to a child of high birth
order when it is born to a very young mother
(as, for example, a third child to a nineteenyear-old girl), and also the risk to a child of
low birth order when it is born to an older
mother (as, for example, a first or second child
to a woman of thirty-five or over). Stated in
another way, it is risky for the child if its birth
order is strikingly unusual in view of the
mother’s age.

All this implies that there are strong intrauterine environmental influences operating on
the foetus, and that a breakdown of the data
by social factors might conceivably serve to
indicate effects of the environments to which
the mothers themselves are exposed. Thus,
analyses in terms of social variables will
eventually be needed if genetic conclusions are
to be drawn from selection studies of hereditary
conditions whenever these are influenced in
their expressions by environmental factors.
Ease of interpretation is not to be expected,
but to follow the superficially simple alternative
of studying only those traits that are determined
wholly by genetic factors, and not at all by
the environment, would exclude from consideration the bulk of the important hereditary and
partially hereditary conditions of man.

Curiously, for one well-known genetic condition, namely mongolism, that is believed to be
determined entirely by inherited factors, there
is an elevated maternal fertility following the
birth of an affected child. The 118 mothers of
mongol children in the present study produced
a total of forty-five subsequent offspring in
the period under consideration, as against an
expected thirty-five, an excess of 27 per cent
(Table 10).

Just why this should be so is not clear. There
is reasonably good ascertainment of cases of
mongolism in British Columbia so that more
nearly complete reporting of affected children
from the lower, and more fertile, socio-economic
subgroups is not a likely explanation. No one
has seriously proposed that the risk of mongolism,
for a given age of mother, is greater in these
subgroups than for the rest of the population,
but this is a possibility.

Such a suggestion should not be taken to

120

imply that mongolian idiocy may be caused
by an environmental effect upon the foetus in
the absence of the gross chromosomal anomalies
usually responsible. But effects of the external
environment upon the mother could perhaps
serve to increase the frequency of chromosomal
non-disjunction in her reproductive cells, in
much the same way that ageing does. Such an
effect would tend to escape detection because
of a lower average age of motherhood in lower
socio-economic groups, and its demonstration

would depend upon comparisons being made
of the age specific risks in different population
subgroups.

Current findings from studies of selection
thus serve to emphasize that increased availability of empirical information on fertility
differences brings with it unexpected problems
of interpretation and that, for the solution of
these, further knowledge of the social characteristics of the individuals is required. Fortunately, our religious, ethnic and economic
particulars are fairly well documented, even if
only the vital records are considered, and an

immediate task is the fuller utilization of the
information that is already potentially available,
on a scale appropriate to permit multiple
breakdowns of the data.

As a minor refinement in the present study,
the effective fertilities of the mothers in terms
of the numbers of offspring surviving to the
end of the period under consideration have
been derived for the four conditions, erythroblastosis, haemorrhagic disease, postnatal
asphyxia and mongolism (Table 11). When this
is done, a slight reduction of fertility is observed
in the case of the first two conditions, and a
slight increase in the case of the other two.

Further attempts to interpret the observed
effects would be unprofitable at this stage when
we have only just started to describe them.
The study so far has considered only five
conditions, only 500 to 600 affected infants,
and the reproductive performances of the
mothers over a period of only four years
maximum. The methods are applicable equally
to conditions of other kinds and to much larger
numbers of families followed over much longer
time spans.

Disease Conditions for which Studies of Mutation
and Selection are Profitable

The empirical data yielded by studies of mutation and selection are, of course, most simply
interpreted where the traits under investigation
are readily recognizable, are determined by
single gene differences and are always expressed
when the causal gene is present. For this reason,
such studies have in the past tended to make use
of a few quite rare genetic traits that come

reasonably close to meeting the ideal specifications. Achondroplastic dwarfism and Huntington’s chorea are examples in point. While
appropriate for establishing genetic principles,
this sort of approach concentrates, as it were, on
a small and unrepresentative part of the total
genetic variability affecting man’s well-being.

At the other end of the spectrum, attempts to
estimate the likely total magnitudes of the
consequences of mutation and of selection have
sometimes been based on gross mortality data,
not subdivided at all by disease cause.?, 5

In between the two extremes there is a wide
range of possible lines of study awaiting exploration, information on which is abundantly
available even if a little tricky to get at. While
routine records such as those of deaths and of
hospital discharges are correctly regarded as
inefficient sources of ascertainments of cases
of the rarer genetic diseases, they do contain
diagnoses of other sorts of conditions that are
appropriate for studies either of mutation or of
selection. Very large numbers of blood groupings,
for example, are recorded annually in hospitals
and as a part of the running of blood banks and
transfusion services. Cases of important diseases
that are partially genetic in origin and inherited
in an irregular fashion are likewise reasonably
well documented, although not necessarily in
any single set of files; diabetes, idiopathic
epilepsy and certain of the congenital malformations being notable examples. A number
of the metrical, or quantitative, traits of man,
of kinds that are suitable for studies of selection
pressures, are likewise widely recorded ; examples
include birth weight which is stated on virtually
all birth registrations, intelligence which is

121
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

measured routinely in many school systems, and
arterial pressure which is commonly taken in the
course of medical examinations.

The possible applications of linkages with
family pedigree information, such as may be
obtained from the vital registrations, varies
somewhat with the nature of the trait under
study. In the case of the blood groups an
important aim is the detection of correlations
with fertility, mortality and morbidity, which
will help to account for the continued prevalence
of a diversity of gene alleles. In the case of
birth weight variations there is a rather special
unsolved problem, in that the modal value
differs unexpectedly from the selective optimum
as judged from the abilities of the infants to
survive the first year of life.3 There are also
special problems associated with the study of
selection as relating to intelligence and school
performance, in that most investigations have
in the past been concerned mainly with a single
generation of test scores. The refinements that
might derive from use on a substantial scale of
two or more generations of scores within the
same pedigrees, to help disentangle a transmissible component in mental ability from the

more obviously environmental components for
the purposes of selection studies, has hardly
been explored at all even in theoretical discussions
of the degree of precision that might eventually
be possible.

For the diseases that display irregular inheritance another sort of problem arises, that bears
on the manner in which tests for selective
pressures may be designed, and that can in
part be investigated by the use of pedigree
information. Because of the nature of these
conditions, many of the carriers of the causal
genes may not be affected, and still others may
have diseases that do not especially resemble
the usual expressions of the genes. A few
aetiological associations between outwardly
diverse traits of an hereditary or partially
hereditary sort have already been established,
as in the case of spina bifida and anencephalus,
and where these exist it is desirable to study
the effects of selection on all of the known
expressions of the underlying causal factors.

_ That such aetiological groupings may perhaps
be more common than has been recognized in
the past is suggested by a recent study of the
risks of death and disease among the brothers

THE STUDY OF MUTATION AND SELECTION IN HUMAN POPULATIONS

and sisters of children with strabismus. This
irregularly inherited trait is particularly well
reported in British Columbia, so that the cases
appearing in the Register of Handicapped
Children and Adults represent a substantial
fraction of the total. In the 207 affected families
which were studied using the linked files of
births, deaths and handicaps, the risk of
strabismus among the later born brothers and
sisters was between forty and fifty times that
for the birth population as a whole (i.e. 6-3
per cent as compared with 0-13 per cent; see
Table 12). This, however, was not the only
risk to which the families were exposed.

An unexpected finding of the study was that
of an approximate doubling of the risks of
stillbirth, death and of handicapping conditions
of other kinds. In fact, the excess of these other
sorts of casualty, taken together, equalled in
number the strabismus cases, each being
represented by about six affected children per
100 brothers and sisters. Thus strabismus would
appear to be aetiologically related in some way
with a wide range of conditions, and about half
of the special risk to the later born siblings of
a child who has strabismus come from the
aetiologically related conditions that may not
even remotely resemble strabismus (see Table 13).

How then do we define in this instance the
genetic entity which we wish to study? If selection
is shown to operate in a certain way when
individuals or families with strabismus are
investigated, might it not perhaps operate in a
different way when the genes responsible, or
some part of them, are expressed differently ?
The interpretation of empirical data on selection
pressures is in such circumstances complicated
by the possibility that there may be still further
expressions of the genes that have not so far
been identified; but this is preferable to the
possible over-simplifications that might arise
from recognition of only a single kind of
expression of the genes.

The exploration of aetiological associations
has in the present instance been aided by two
circumstances: (a) the use of systematically
collected files of all live births, stillbirths, child
handicaps and child deaths in a large defined
population, regardless of any preconceived
notions concerning the genetic or non-genetic

origins of the various events of morbidity and
mortality; and, (5) the integration of these files
into the form of family histories of vital and
health events using rapid modern methods of
data processing. Under no other circumstances
could the relationships with strabismus have

been demonstrated with the same degree of
precision, or in the relatively short period of
time (about two days) which the study took.
Current work is being directed to eliminating
some remaining manual steps in such operations
so that a large number of conditions can be
treated similarly in a single study using larger
files of records.

123
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Costs and Administrative Applications

I will not at this stage discuss in any detail
the methods used for this kind of work,
since these have already been fully described
elsewhere.4, 5. 9, 10,11 The present status of
the undertaking has also been _ reported
earlier.8

However, since descriptions of this kind of
work may give it the appearance of being
excessively elaborate and costly in relation to
the likely yield of genetic information, some
clarification may be in order. The record
linkage approach makes use only of information
that is already being collected and recorded.
In our own case, it has also employed mechanically readable punchcards that are already being
prepared routinely from these original records
for the extraction of annual statistics, and for
the compilation of alphabetic name indexes of
the kinds used for searching out birth registrations and such. The only innovation in relation
to these existing procedures has been a minor
modification of the vital statistics name index
cards to include additional family identification
such as the mother’s maiden surname and the
parental initials, ages and provinces of birth.
The cost involved is slight, and the modified
index cards, suitable for purposes of family

linkage, are now used routinely for all events of’

marriage, live birth, stillbirth and death over
the whole of Canada.

The most demanding part of such an undertaking is the development of increasingly versatile
and rapid computer methods for inter-filing
and linking the successive annual crops of
records into family packets, and for extracting
the resulting pedigree information in the required
form after this has been done. Using the most
recent programmes developed for a fast modern
computer, the cost of the actual merging and
linking of the marriage, birth, death and
handicap records, when suitably arranged in
magnetic tape form, is very much less than
that of preparing the punchcard records in the
first place, being only about a quarter of a
cent per updating record; and the current speeds
of the updating and linking operation are in
the vicinity of 1,000 to 2,000 incoming records per
minute, so that the 40,000 annual birth records

124

for British Columbia can be incorporated into
the master family file in less than an hour.

What may not be generally recognized is the
extent to which methods for the automatic
linkage of records may serve existing administrative needs, relating to the uses of these
same records. One example will serve to illustrate the point. The bringing together of
information from all birth registrations into
family groupings is, in fact, already being carried
out over the whole of Canada by laborious
manual methods as a necessary part of the
operation of a government scheme of family
allowances. To ensure that false claims will be
detected, information from the mother’s application form is in each instance compared visually
with alphabetic lists of the names of newborn
infants derived from the birth index cards,
and with information from the existing family
files wherever the family is already “in pay’’.
These verifications of the mothers’ statements
account for 20 per cent of all family allowance
file upkeep operations, which together cost in
the vicinity of $1.25 per family per year. Substantial financial savings are thus potentially
possible, using a rapid automatic record linkage procedure which could in addition yield
family groupings of records for population
research.

There are numerous other examples of uses
to which the linkage technology might be put,
and if family groupings of routine records are
ever to be employed extensively as a source of
information on the genetics of human populations, it will be because cognizance has been
taken of these administrative needs in setting
up stable, continuing systems which will permit
scientific information to be derived as a byproduct.

In the long run, it is doubtful whether precision
in the study of selective forces, and perhaps in
the study of mutation as well, is likely to be
achieved in any other way, in view of the inaccuracies and the limited quantity of family
pedigree information that can be derived from
ad hoc surveys of conventional design based
on personal interviews and questionnaires.
Precision in the study of mutation and selection
will undoubtedly be needed if we are to understand, and eventually control as Galton

suggested, the influences that determine our
genetic future.

Summary

Studies of mutation and selection, as influencing
the genetically simple traits of man, have been
popular in the past but they tell little about the
overall magnitudes of the effects of these two
forces throughout the genome as a whole.
Similar studies would be desirable, relating to
the collectively more important characteristics
of man that are less simply inherited, and that
are determined by combinations of environmental and hereditary factors. But such work is
beset with difficulties arising out of the numerous
environmental inhomogeneities characteristic of
human populations. To be interpretable, data
from these more difficult sorts of investigations
must be broken down by a multiplicity of social
variables; and correspondingly larger amounts
of data are needed to make possible the required
multivariate approach.

An abundance of relevant information about
people is in fact recorded, which we have only
begun to tap, describing not only their biological
characteristics and family relationships, but
their social circumstances as well. Application
of this body of knowledge depends largely upon
bringing together, or “linking”, the separately
recorded facts about the same individuals and
families. Such “‘record linkages”’ will have many
uses if the process of linking can be made cheap
enough and rapid enough. In the long run,
understanding of the magnitudes of the effects
of recurrent mutations, and of various selective
forces, on the quality of the human gene pool
may depend upon the use of such methodological developments to take maximum
advantage of information we already possess.
