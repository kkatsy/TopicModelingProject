Family Size and Population Growth

in Western Countries

SOME

HE MORE CHILDREN married couples
have, the faster the population will grow.
The two factors—family size and the rate
of increase in the total population—are evidently connected, but an exact correlation
between the two cannot be expected because of
the influence of other vital elements such as
marriage and mortality—not to speak of migration. Moreover, attention can hardly be limited
to contemporary measurements of the two
factors, as there will often be a time lag before
the second reflects the first. Given, however (say),
three countries that are broadly similar in their
general demographic characteristics but with
appreciably differing prospects for the completed family size of their young couples, the
chances are that in the near future their growth
rates will diverge correspondingly, even if they
are not doing so at present.

In these notes, some statistics will be given for
the United States of America, for France and
for Great Britain. In recent years the rates of
growth of their populations have differed
markedly, as the following figures show:

U.S.A. FRANCE BRITAIN

Population in Millions, 1950 152 41-7 44-0
» » 1962 187 46-4 46:3
Average Annual rate
growth 1950-1962 17% O9% 04%

The differences between the figures in the
bottom line may not at first sight seem to be very
significant. When their economic implications
are considered, however, they must be viewed in
a new light. The United States population is now
growing at a rate of nearly 2 per cent per annum
—as rapid a pace as for the world as a whole and
one almost certainly too high to be matched for
long by a corresponding increase in resources.

FACTS

By contrast, Britain’s growth is at a much more
comfortable level from an economic viewpoint.
That of France is intermediate between the two.
The question is, what can be said of the implications of the growth rates in terms of completed
family size?

Reference to the figures available from the
latest United Nations Demographic Year Book
to feature fertility as a special subject (that of
1959) reveals some figures of completed family
size that are by no means startling. The most
modern data of this kind relate to women aged
45-49, and so having just completed their family
building, and are as follows:

The differences in average family size between
the three countries are not very marked in these
data. It must be borne in mind, however,
that the figures relate mainly to the fertility
of twenty or more years before the date
shown. Moreover, the particulars were
measured at different times over a range of eight
years, and, as they include spinsters, they also
reflect the varying proportions marrying. In

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

recent years, fertility has been rising in the
U.S.A. and in Britain, and the size of the family
has increased. In the United States of America,
birth rates for third and fourth children in
particular have risen very sharply during the
last ten years.

The following figures relate to the expected
total numbers of births of currently married
couples where the wife is aged between fifteen
and fifty; the American data omit non-whites
and the average family size may thus be a little
understated :

The figures represent a mixture of experiences
of cohorts, the average expected family size
being higher for the most recent marriages and
lower for the earlier marriages in both the

U.S.A. and in Britain. Their international
differences still do not fully reflect the variations
in the rate of population growth.

In general terms, if one allows for these
countries (say) 3 per cent for losses due to
mortality, and 7 per cent for non-marriage and
for broken marriages, but 5 per cent for illegitimate children, the net total loss in a generation
is of the order of 5 per cent. Thus 2:1 children per
couple will be necessary for population replacement. It follows that 42 children per couple
would double the population in a generation, i.e.
in a little over twenty-five years, and this would
correspond to a rate of growth of nearly 3 per
cent per annum. As a broad measure, one may
hypothecate for such highly-developed countries
the following scale of rough equivalences:

RATE OF GROW TH

AVERAGE NUMBER OF
CHILDREN PER MARRIED

COUPLE IN COMPLETED FAMILY % per annum
2 —
2¢ 2
3 13
34 23
4 3

The figures in the right-hand column are
slightly rounded-up. They would apply only in
the long run, in the absence of migration, and if
other demographic factors were stable and in
accordance with expectation. In particular, the
present growth rates may differ from the
theoretical level for a variety of reasons, one of
which could be that the age-distribution of the
population does not conform to the pattern that
would eventually emerge in conjunction with the
stable demographic factors assumed.
