Gonorrhoea and Fertility in Uganda

GANDA IS A country of more than six

million people. It lies on the Equator,

bounding Lake Victoria on its northern
and western shores, and no contraceptive practices, either of taboo type or preventive, are
known to operate in any part of the country.
These are usually considered to be conditions
making for high fertility, but since 1948
it has been known that some tribes in Uganda
have a fertility which is lower than that of
many other African peoples. For instance, the
crude birth rate for the Baganda, numerically the
largest tribe in Uganda, is lower than many of
the rates, believed to be accurate, found elsewhere in Africa; this is shown in Table 1.

NOTE: The data for the territories other than Uganda
were obtained from United Nations sources ( Yearbook
1960).1 They are the results of sample censuses.

The Uganda General African Census in 1948
had shown that 24-4 per cent of all women in
Buganda over the age of forty-five years had
never borne a child. An estimate made in 1952,
based on the questioning of ninety-nine women
over the age of forty-five years, produced a figure
of more than 30 per cent for absolute sterility.?
There are many reasons for thinking that this
sort of inquiry gives an inaccurate assessment.

Ignorance, suspicion, poor recollection and
sample bias are some of the more obvious ones.

The anthropological study of Richards and
Reining, although designed to throw light on
how cultural characteristics affect fertility in the
Baganda, failed to provide any explanation. The
authors came to the conclusion that “‘physiological factors” were probably responsible. It
was known sixty years ago that venereal disease
was extremely common in the areas in question?
and there is good evidence that it is still common.
It seemed obvious that a connection should be
looked for between fertility and gonorrhoea. This
disease is known to produce permanent sterility
in women, and it also affects male fertility. The
complications of gonorrhoea in women, namely
salpingitis, pyosalpinx, and pelvic inflammatory
disease, and in men, urethral stricture leading to
extravasation and retention of urine, are all extremely common in Mulago Hospital, which is
situated in Kampala, the capital of Buganda and
of Uganda.

The Uganda Protectorate is divided administratively and for census purposes into four
Provinces, which are subdivided into fifteen
Districts. These correspond roughly to ethnological units, but some fairly large migrations
have taken place to complicate the situation.
The opportunity for collecting data arose in two
ways. Firstly, the General African Census and
Sample Census in 1959 provided fertility data
which were fairly reliable and the errors of which
were known. There were quite large variations in
fertility rates between Districts. Secondly, all
Uganda Government and Mission Hospitals,
and Government Dispensaries, are required to
provide monthly and annual returns of disease.
This allowed connections between gonorrhoea
and fertility to be studied on a District basis. In
addition, the opportunity was taken of studying

103

urethral stricture in men, a late manifestation of
gonorrhoea which is very common in some areas.

Sources of Data

1. Fertility

The data were taken from the 1959 General and
5 per cent Sample Census.* The index selected
for use was the General Fertility Rate (G.F.R.).
This represents the number of children born per
annum per thousand women of reproductive age,
taken to be sixteen to forty-five years inclusive.
The rate was derived from the total annual
births (obtained by a combination of six different
methods) related to the relevant number of
women, ascertained from the age-distribution
curve, which was itself constructed from data
from two sources (for a detailed discussion, including a mathematical justification, see Lury
1961*).

2. Gonorrhoea and Urethral Stricture

The annual returns of disease for all Government Hospitals and Dispensaries and all Mission
Hospitals were scrutinised. Those for the years
1959 and 1960-61, and the six-month period
January to June 1960, were used. In addition,
the Annual Medical Reports from all Districts
for the five years, 1956 to 1960, were read. The
relevant totals for in-patient acute gonorrhoea,
and urethral stricture, out-patient acute gonor
rhoea and dispensary acute gonorrhoea were
extracted. Only the figures for males were used
because the diagnosis of gonorrhoea in women is
much less certain than in men, and because the
utilization of medical services by African women
varies a great deal, so that hospital and dispensary
figures for them reflect the total amount of
disease less accurately than the figures for men. 
Only in-patient figures for male urethral stricture were used. This was because the medical
assistants who staff dispensaries and some outpatient departments diagnose urethral stricture
inconsistently, whereas their diagnosis of acute
gonorrhoea is good. By and large, throughout the
country only patients with urethral stricture
complicated by retention of urine, extravasation
of urine, and perineal fistula are admitted to
hospital. Thus the recorded incidence of stricture
is really the incidence of its complications.
Female urethral stricture is related to lymphogranuloma venereum, not to gonorrhoea.

In order to calculate an approximate incidence
for gonorrhoea and stricture, the totals from each
District were related to the total number of individuals at risk. For both gonorrhoea and stricture
the total was assessed at one-seventh of the whole
male population. Inspection of the age-distribution curves for the unselected male V.D. clinic at
Mulago Hospitak, and for one of the stricture
clinics there showed that the great majority of

patients with gonorrhoea were in the group aged
fifteen to thirty-four years, and the great majority
of patients with stricture were in the group over
thirty-five years. As these two groups formed
15-9 per cent and 13-3 per cent of the male population respectively, it was thought justifiable to
regard them as equal at 14-3 per cent, or oneseventh. This arbitrary method was felt to be
sufficiently accurate; it was probably as accurate
as the diagnosis of disease.

The gonorrhoea rates were expressed as a percentage of the population at risk, assuming that
the diagnosis was made only once for each man
each year. The stricture rate was expressed as
the annual number of men admitted to hospital
per 10,000 of the total number of men over
thirty-five years old.

The data are set out in Table 2.

Reliability of the Data

General Fertility Rate

This represents the best use of the available data.
However, two rates need further comment. The
rate for West Nile District, although fully as
reliable as of the rest of Northern Province, may
not have reflected the true fertility of its women,
as large migrations of young men take place to
centres such a Kampala. The rate for the Bugisu
was probably too high because of the distribution of the areas used for the sample census
(Lury, 1962, personal communication). The
standard errors of the sample data lay for most
Districts between 5 and 10 per cent, with a range
for all Districts of from 4 to 15 per cent. The data
for Buganda were probably the most reliable.

Acute Gonorrhoea in Males

The bulk were out-patients and dispensary
patients, and were diagnosed and treated by
medical assistants. In Lango District in 1958,
253 men who were diagnosed in this way had
smears of their urethral discharge examined
microscopically. Sixty-nine per cent were positive for the gonococcus. This percentage is about
what is found in the unselected male V.D. clinic
at Mulago, where every patient is seen by a
physician with a higher qualification in medicine.
The figure obtained represents patients seen and
not patients treated, as insufficient penicillin may
have been available at some up-country centres

to treat every case. The totals obtained from
Teso District were so high that an attempt was
made to verify them. Dr. F. J. Bennett, of the
Department of Public Health, Makerere College,
was consulted. He visited the District and reported that, if anything, the truth was even
worse than the figures indicated. The hospital
and dispensary totals for Bugisu District may
not have reflected accurately the disease in the
District. Bugisu is on the Kenya border and no
Kenya Government hospitals cover the adjacent
areas adequately. Consequently a substantial
number of hospital patients do not live in the
area from which the census data were derived
(Dean, R.F.A., 1962, personal communication).

In each District, the numbers of cases of
gonorrhoea reported were consistent from year to
year, except when the numbers were small. The
total hospital figures for gonorrhea over the last
five years have risen steadily.®

Urethral Stricture

The totals from each District varied from year
to year, but were fairly constant in the areas
where the stricture rate was high. In addition,
where a District contained both a Government
hospital and a Mission hospital, the totals for
each were closely related. A further piece of confirmatory evidence was available. The total
number of operations for insertion of a suprapubic catheter in each Government hospital in
1959 and 1960 was collected. The prime indication for this operation in Uganda is complicated
urethral stricture, and it was found that the frequency of the operation closely paralleled the
in-patient figures for stricture.

There is an obvious source of error in measuring stricture incidence, and this is connected
with the availability of hospital beds. The extremes are in the Bunyoro and Teso Districts:
the first has about three times as many per head
as the second. However, most of the complications of stricture are urgent and lethal enough to
make in-patient figures a reasonable indicator
of incidence.

Method

The District rates for gonorrhoea and for
stricture were plotted against the District Fertility
Rate and regression lines were calculated.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Results

The gonorrhoea rate varied widely between Districts. In Teso District the rate was much higher
than anywhere else, but the Mubende and Bugisu
rates were also high. Bunyoro had a high rate
and so did Mengo and Lango. In general, the
Districts of low fertility are those which have
been mentioned, with the exception that Bugisu
has a high fertility rate. Ankole and Kigezi Districts in particular, have the highest of the reliable
fertility rates, and these Districts have low rates
for gonorrhoea and stricture. As far as stricture
rates are concerned, Mengo, Masaka, and Bunyoro dominated.

From Figures 1 and 2 it can be seen that
reasonably good inverse correlations were obtained. The correlation coefficient for the
gonorrhoea/fertility relation was 0-64 (p =
<0-01), and that between stricture and fertility
was 0-59 (p between 0-05 and 0-01).

DISCUSSION

The findings strongly suggest that in Uganda
fertility is largely determined by the frequency
of gonorrhoea. This idea is not new. It was advanced tentatively by Lorimer in 1954,° but no
evidence other than hearsay was adduced in
support. Indeed, in 1952, Richards and Reining?
doubted whether venereal disease was responsible for the low fertility in Buganda and around
Bukoba. In view of the known concern of the
Buganda about their fertility, it is surprising that
the connection with gonorrhoea has not been previously investigated.

Although urethral stricture in men does not
bear the same causal relation to sterility as
gonorrhoea, it correlates with the fertility rate
GONORRHOEA AND FERTILITY IN UGANDA

fairly well. For several reasons a closer correlation is unlikely. Firstly, the relation is indirect,
not causal. Secondly, although gonorrhoea in a
population expresses itself rapidly in the form of
sterility, it takes from twenty to twenty-five years
to produce a urethral stricture. It is likely that a
correlation between events separated by a long
period will be poorer than when they are closer
together in time.

Several features of the fertility patterns of the
areas with a high stricture rate can be explained
best on the hypothesis that fertility is largely
determined by gonorrhoea. There is available a
model of the age-specific fertility rates of a hypothetical population where early marriage and the
absence of fertility barriers combine to produce
a pattern of relatively unlimited fertility. This
model has been constructed from data derived
from several different populations.® It is useful
as a basis for comparison.

In Figure 3 the age-specific fertility rates for
the Baganda population of Buganda, a low
fertility area, and for Ankole District, which has
the highest general fertility rate in Uganda, are
compared with this hypothetical maximum. The
figure demonstrates the close correspondence of
the Ankole curve to the maximum showing that
in this area, contiguous with Buganda, fertility
is comparable with that found elsewhere. It also
shows that the rate for the Baganda, although it
starts close to the hypothetical maximum, falls
away from it progressively in the later agegroups. This is the type of curve to be expected
when an acquired fertility barrier is increasing
in effect throughout the reproductive period.
The curve for the Baganda is quite different in
shape from that characteristic, for example, of
late marriage as a fertility barrier in populations
of high fertility.’

A characteristic of the type of fertility impairment expected of gonorrhoea is irreversibility. As
individual women acquire the disease they are
removed from the potentially completely fertile
group to the sterile group, and never again bear
children. In successive age-groups the proportion
of infertile women thus becomes larger. (It is
assumed for this argument, that fertile women
die no more quickly than sterile women.) To test
whether or not the areas of low fertility conformed to this expectation, the age-specific rates

for the five least fertile Districts (Mengo,
Mubende, Teso, Bunyoro, and Busoga) were
averaged and the value obtained for each agegroup was expressed as a percentage of the
hypothetical maximum. It was assumed that the
women in these Districts had no additional
cause for their infertility. The age-specific percentage is plotted in Figure 4.

From a level of about 80 per cent in the fifteen
to nineteen years age-group, the curve falls away
as age increases. Although the fall lessens, the
curve neither quite flattens nor does it rise. It
reaches a level of about 50 per cent in the
twenty-five to twenty-nine year and to thirtyfour year age-groups. This can be taken to mean
that half the women in these areas have become
sterile by the age of thirty years. The supposition
is made that fertility in these areas is potentially
near the hypothetical maximum.

The reasons for the very high disease rates can
only be guessed at. The Baganda seem to be indifferent to the risk of acquiring venereal disease.
Indeed, the story is told that there was a measure
of social cachet attached to men having gonorrhoea, because a ruler of the Baganda, Mutesa the
First, contracted it in the 1870s. Men with the
disease were called “‘Amazira’’, or “the Brave
Ones” on this account. The situation is paradoxical. On the one hand there is no doubt that
the Baganda desire children intensely, and sexual
activity appears to occupy a very prominent
position in the culture. On the other hand, the
men ensure the sterility of a large proportion of
their women by a complete disregard of precautions which seem to us elementary. Perhaps
the kindest explanation is that they do not understand the connection between gonorrhoea and
fertility.

SUMMARY

1. The incidences of acute gonorrhoea and of urethral
stricture in males in the various Districts of Uganda have
been calculated.

2. The rates have been compared with the female
fertility rates for each District and significant inverse
correlations obtained.

3. It is concluded that gonorrhoea is one of the major
determinants of fertility in Uganda.

4. Confirmatory evidence for this view is discussed.

5. It is likely that in some areas of Uganda one-half
of the women have been sterilized by gonorrhoea by the
age of thirty.
