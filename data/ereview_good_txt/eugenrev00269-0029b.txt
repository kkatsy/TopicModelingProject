Birth Control Federation of America

Tue Birth Control Federation of America

recently celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary. Fellows and Members will be interested to hear that a congratulatory telegram
was sent to Mrs. Sanger by Lord Horder on
behalf of the Eugenics Society.

Family Planning Association

Many of the clinics run by branches of the
Association report an increase in the number
of their patients due to war conditions and in
some cases, were more funds available, their
Committees would increase the number of
Clinic Sessions to relieve the strain on doctors
and workers.

A special Sub-Committee of the Associa
‘tion is at present preparing a scheme by

which it is hoped to collect clinical statistics
of the relative efficiency of certain chemical
contraceptives. There is, in particular,
special need for evidence as to whether
Volpar (the contraceptive discovered by Dr.
J. R. Baker and Dr. H. M. Carleton, when they
were working for the Birth Control Investigation Committee) is as efficient in clinic
practice as laboratory tests both in this
country and the U.S.A. would lead one to
expect.

Correction

WE regret the omission of a word in the
report of Mr. Jackson Burrows’s paper on
the Prevention of Crippling in the October
1941 issue of the REview. On page 83,
column 2, the third line should read “ for
non-tuberculous adult cripples, unless destitute.”
