Rapid Falls

In Fertility

In Recent Years

SOME

T SEEMS TO be generally believed that
| ec is the only country in which there has

been a rapid fall in fertility in recent years. This
is largely true outside Europe, where there has
been nothing on a national scale to parallel the
Japanese reduction in the birth rate from 30 per
thousand in 1945-49 to 17 per thousand in
1959-61, a drop of 45 per cent.

Some almost equally remarkable developments have, however, been occurring in Eastern

The amounts of the falls are, on the whole,
remarkably consistent. The variation in the
dates of onset may perhaps be associated with
political events and, in particular, with the
change from Stalinism to a less repressive régime,
though this general trend may not account for

FACTS

Europe or, more accurately, in most parts of
Eastern Europe, since about 1950. The countries
that have not shared in this fall are Russia—
much of which, of course, lies outside Europe—
and East Germany and Albania. But in Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania
and Yugoslavia some striking diminutions in
the birth rate have taken place in the last ten
years or so, as may be seen from the following

figures :

29-7 23°8 28-4

24-7 20-2 23-0
22°4 19-1 23-1
20°7 17°5 22-6

all the differences. They show how potent pressure from the State can be in such countries in
influencing demographic events and what
dramatic changes can ensue when that pressure
is relieved—or replaced by different kinds of
pressure.

These conclusions are in no way weakened by
a study of .what has happened in Albania—
where the birth rate has risen from 32 after the
Second World War to over 40 to-day—and East
Germany, where there has been a rise from 13
to 17. In the second of these two instances, however, the immediate post-war figure must be regarded as being unduly depressed and one should
perhaps speak of a steady but low level of fertility in East Germany.
