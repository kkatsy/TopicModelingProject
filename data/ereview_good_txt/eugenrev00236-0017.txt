A NOTE ON THE LENGTH OF LIFE OF
“MEN OF DISTINCTION”

By MARJORY ATSATT

SEARCH of the literature concerned
Aw human longevity confirms the

need, which has recently been mentioned,* for additional evidence as to the
length of life of men of distinction. Certain
facts of interest are now available as an outgrowth of a study undertaken for a quite
different purpose.t These concern the length
of life of 4,736 distinguished men, native to
the British Isles between 1100 and 1800, for
whom the year of birth and year of death are
recorded.

These men assume historical importance
as representing native-born eminence in the
British Isles over a period of seven hundred
years. Drawn from the ranks of kings and
commoners alike, they embrace within their
numbers the patriot ardent in the struggle for
political freedom, the scholar quiet in the
solitude of his study, the churchman deep
in the controversies of Church and State, the
innovator in art, science or mechanics, and
men whose claim to distinction would seem
to lie in some chance circumstance.

As to their distribution in time, these
eminent men are to be envisaged as belonging
chiefly to the latter part of the historical
period in question. With eighty per cent.
actually born during the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, and the first significant
increase in their numbers appearing during
the sixteenth, the eighteenth century completes this picture by itself adding a thirtytwo per cent. increase over the representation
for the seventeenth century. (Table I.)

1936, p. 57

California under the direction of Professor F. J. Teggart,
is based upon a sampling of the Dictionary of National
Biography arrived at by the selection of each third
person in the “‘ epitome.”

As grouped by decennial periods, the unsmoothed percentage frequency polygon for
the total sample presents for “ length of life ”’
a fairly normal but somewhat positively
skewed distribution. With a mode of
“seventy to seventy-nine’’ years and an
arithmetic mean of 66-3 + -12 years, “ length
of life ’’ shows a dispersion measured by a
standard deviation of 14:8+1-o and an
actual range of recorded age of from nineteen
to 112 years (Table II). Four-fifths of the distinguished men born in the British Isles are
seen to have completed a life span of from
fifty to eighty-nine years. For each succeeding decennial period there is a percentage
increase up to the ‘‘ seventy to seventy-nine”’
year group. This is followed by a twelve per
cent. reduction for the octogenarians, and an
additional fourteen per cent. decrease for the
nonagenarians.

When the century by century distributions of “‘ length of life ’’ are considered, it
appears that the mean “ length of life” for
the great men born in the eighteenth is
increased by ten years over that for those
born in the thirteenth and fourteenth

“MEN

 

OF DISTINCTION” 99
“Length of life,’’ as distributed in four
groups, conveniently referred to as the “ very
elderly,’’ the “‘ elderly,” the “‘ middle aged,”’
and the “ young ”’ at death, indicates that
nineteen per cent. of the 4,736 distinguished
men lived to be eighty or more years, fiftytwo per cent. died between the ages of sixty
and seventy-nine years, twenty-three per
cent. between the ages of forty and fifty-nine,
while only six per cent. died before the age
of forty. (Table IV.) This distribution, considered by century of birth, shows interesting
changes in the proportion of the four groups.
For example, among the very elderly we find
the eight per cent. representation of the
thirteenth increasing to twenty-three per
cent. in the eighteenth century. On the
other hand, the elderly group maintains its
proportion of relatively half for each of the
centuries. The middle-aged, represented by
thirty-eight per cent. for the thirteenth
century, decline in proportion to twenty per
cent. for the eighteenth century, and those
eminent men who died as young men claim
but four per cent. of the eighteenth-century
representation, as compared with fifteen per
cent. for the twelfth century.

Summarizing the findings briefly, it appears
that the eminent men native to the British
Isles between 1100 and 1800, whose length of
life is known, belong chiefly to the more
recent centuries, with the eighteenth century
assembling over half of the recognized greatness for these seven hundred years. Age at
death for these men ranges actually from nine
