EUGENICS
REVIEW

‘Man is gifted with pity and other kindly feelings; he

has also the power of preventing many kinds of suffering.
I conceive it to fall well within his province to replace
Natural Selection by other processes that are more
merciful and not less effective. This is precisely the aim

of eugenics’
