A Fifth Freedom?”

YOU WILL RECOLLECT that Franklin Roosevelt
in a speech on 6th January 1941 said:

“In the future days, which we seek to make
secure, we look forward to a world founded
upon four essential freedoms”’.

And I would suggest that it is time to consider a
fifth freedom—freedom from the tyranny of
excessive fertility.

I propose to consider this problem first from
the point of view of world population and
secondly from the point of view of the individual
man and woman.

World Population Problem

Whereas high fertility was a necessary safeguard for man’s survival in primitive societies,
where deaths at all ages were high and the
expectation of life was short, this no longer
obtains in advanced societies, where death rates
are so low that an average of 2-3 children per
family has sufficed to ensure replacement of the
population. The great advances in science and
technology in the highly developed countries
have now been applied to certain of the underdeveloped countries with such success that death
rates are falling rapidly, while the high fertility
pattern, formerly necessary in these societies for
survival, still obtains and the world is faced with
a fantastic increase in population, which, if
unchecked, may indeed threaten the survival of
mankind.

It has been estimated that the world population was possibly about 30-50 million before the
discovery of agriculture, by the mid-seventeenth
century it was 650 million, by the beginning of
the nineteenth century 1,000 million, and by 1950
about 2,000 million. The average rate of increase

per annum in each period has been 0-1, 1-0 and
1:5 per cent respectively. I shall give a few
examples of what is happening to-day in
different types of society.

Mauritius.—An example of the catastrophic
effect of modern chemotherapy on a population
can be seen in Mauritius (Burnet, 1961), where
an intensive campaign to eliminate malaria by
the use of DDT and other modern techniques
was so successful in 1946-48 that infant mortality
fell from about 150 to 50 per 1,000 in ten years.
The general death rate fell from 28 to 10 per
1,000 and the population rose by 40 per cent.

India.—In India, though Nehru (Times, 11th
December 1963) and his Government recognized
the dangers of population increase and supported
a policy of birth control, in practice in the second
five-year plan for India only $10 million was
allocated for population control as against $14
million for malaria control, a measure which, by
lowering death rates quickly, could further
aggravate the population crisis and reduce the
standard of living, in that more capital, skills,
and experience are absorbed in looking after
children and young people and less is available
for industrial development. The population of
India is increasing by about 8 million a year
(2 per cent), and it has been calculated that
unless the birth rate is halved in the next twentyfive years the prospect of economic betterment
may disappear entirely.

Pakistan.—So many more of the children in
Pakistan are surviving and growing to maturity
that even if they in due course have smaller
families the total population will continue to rise.
Those who say that there is no need to take
emergency measures to cut down birth rates in
such countries as Pakistan and India and think
that things will right themselves as they did in
Europe should note that it took fully 100 years
of industrialization and education to reduce the
English birth rate at all.

Africaa—In some of the more primitive

195

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

societies in Africa still unaffected by modern
medicine there is no problem of overpopulation,
and high birth rates are necessary for replacement, since death rates are high. In some parts
of Africa, for example, 50 per cent of children
born alive are dead by the age of five.

It was a hard struggle for primitive societies to
survive and flourish, and traditions and customs
were developed which ensured that women bore
virtually the maximum number of children that
was physiologically possible, and the death of
one child was followed immediately by the
conception of the next. High fertility and a strong
instinctive love of children were therefore
essential.

Policy of Aid by Advanced Countries

We need a more positive policy of aid to these
countries. The advanced nations must do everything they can to help Governments of countries
with a low standard of living and high birth
rates to solve their problem. The present crisis
is that quantity threatens quality, the present
threatens the future. The Americans have
largely sponsored the International Planned
Parenthood Movement and have given both
money and expert help on a very generous scale:
but voluntary effort is not enough in large
countries like India, especially when the additional factors of extreme poverty and the passive
attitude of most of the people are considered.
Attempts to persuade United Nations to give
help have failed up to now. When the question
was raised by Sweden and Denmark at the
United Nations Assembly in 1962 the opposition
succeeded in removing from the resolution a
clause empowering the United Nations to give
technical help on methods of population control
to Governments requesting it.

However, in May 1965 the World Health
Assembly agreed to recommend that such help
should be given to Governments requesting it.*
The British Government has more recently
supported the application of the International
Planned Parenthood Federation to be recognized

* This recommendation was not accepted by the
World Health Organization. See The Eugenics Review,
September 1966, 58, 119. Enprror.

by the United Nations as a non-governmental
organization.

To the outsider, at least, it seems that one of
the main reasons why the World Health
Organization has done virtually nothing about
population control is that Roman Catholics
claim a right to regulate the conduct of others
besides themselves.

Problem in Industrialized Societies

Japan.—The most dramatic and effective
attack on overpopulation has just been completed in Japan, a highly industrialized society,
short of living-space. The birth rate fell from
34 to 18 per 1,000 between 1948 and 1959. This
was achieved under a “‘eugenic protection law”
which legalized abortion and family planning.
About 50 per cent of pregnancies ended in
abortion. This was the only way in which the
birth rate could be brought down quickly in the
circumstances. Now there is more reliance on
birth-control methods, which are being taught
in 800 health centres by 50,000 visiting nurses
and midwives who have received special training
in the methods in use. Nevertheless the population will rise to over 100 million by 1990.

USA—The USA, the most advanced technological society in the world, faces a doubling of
its population in the next thirty years. The death
rate is so low that with an average family size of
only 3-0 the annual increase in population is
2 per cent, as high as any in the world. The
problem here, of course, is of a different type
from that of the underdeveloped countries in
that the standard of living is so high that it is.
making great demands on the world’s available
resources and on the ability of the community
to mobilize sufficient social services, such as
education and medical care.

Britain—A rapid population increase has
been going on in Britain since the eighteenth
century, though during the industrial depression
of the 1930s the birth rate fell to below replacement. This, however, proved to be only a
temporary phenomenon, and since the 1939-45
war the birth rate has risen. The total population
is forecast at 65 million in 2003—an increase of
18 million over forty years. It must be rememA FIFTH FREEDOM?

bered, however, that long-term demographic
forecasts can be unreliable.

Problem for the Individual

Let us now consider the problem of excessive
fertility from the point of view of the individual.

In Britain, replacement of the population
requires an average of only 2-3 children per
family. Most young people seem to plan their
families carefully with a view to giving the
children ‘“‘the best chance in life’, and three
seems to be about the number most of them feel
they can cope with. Since most women marry
under the age of twenty-five and are capable of
producing three times this number it is clear
that control of conception is the rule for almost
everyone. Until recently the methods available
were unreliable even when used with care and
put a considerable nervous strain on the couple
concerned. Not unexpectedly there are great
social class differences in methods employed and
in the efficiency with which they are used. For
example, in the United Kingdom the percentage
of women having a fifth or subsequent child
varies from three in social classes I and II
(professional and managerial classes) to fourteen
in social classes IV and V (the semi-skilled and
unskilled manual classes). Again the percentage
varies from seven in the South-east of England
to twelve in the North. These regional differences
are related to the fact that women in London and
the Home Counties are more sophisticated than
in the industrial North. In addition, there is
considerable migration from the North to the
South of more intelligent and enterprising men
and women who are attracted by higher standards
of living and who tend to limit the size of their
families.

Table 1, from the report of the Family
Planning Association Working Party (1963),
shows that in “birth control minded”’ couples
withdrawal remains the most preferred procedure
in the lowest social classes but loses popularity
progressively at higher social levels. The steepest
gradient, sloping the other way, is in the use of
the cap, and there is a similar but less steep
social gradient in the use of the sheath. In the
highest class one couple in four have at least

tried the cap, in the intermediate class 1 in 10,
and in the lower only 1 in 66.

Although progress in family planning is
encouraging, the authors of this report feel that
there is still point in the judgements passed by
the Royal Commission on Population in 1949:

*“At present, though the practice of contraception is widespread, public knowledge of
effective methods is very uneven, and faulty
knowledge causes a formidable amount of harm.
This is reflected most obviously in the prevalence
of criminal abortion. No precise estimates of the
prevalence of criminal abortion are available,
but all authorities are agreed that it is sufficiently
widespread to constitute a grave social evil... .
Abortion is a form of family limitation resorted
to, for the most part, because of failure, through
ignorance or other cause, to prevent conception.
The use of relatively unreliable methods of
contraception (for example, coitus interruptus)
is the cause of other distress that does not find
expression in this extreme form; the harm arises
not only from the failures but also from the fear
of failure; and the evidence submitted to us
suggests that much marital disharmony can be
traced to the anxiety that accompanies the
practice of coitus interruptus. Finally, faulty
knowledge or practice of contraception contributes to some of the harmful consequences of
the differential birth rate, among them the social
and other problems that arise from the large
numbers of children who are born to men and
women, who, through defects of intellect or
character, are unable to care properly for them.”

197
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

With the most careful use of the mechanical
methods, the sheath and the cap, failures do
occur, and there is therefore always some degree
of apprehension attached to their use which may
disturb harmonious marital relations.

The advent of the contraceptive pill is a great
advance and will be a revolution if in the light
of experience it can be shown to be free of
harmful effects. Fox (the Director of the Family
Planning Association) said: ‘““We (the Association) are, or should be, concerned not only with
the people who want help but also with the much
larger number who need it. . . . The time has
come to persuade our professions, the public and
the Government that aid over the physical and
mental side of marriage is a necessary part of
preventive medicine which ought to be given
under the National Health Service.”

I shall describe how we have attempted to help
the women of Aberdeen to solve the problem of
family planning.

Family Planning Clinics

Before the Second World War the ‘“Constructive Birth Control Clinic’, run on a
voluntary basis by Mrs. Fenella Paton, was for
practical purposes the only source of advice on
the subject in Aberdeen. In 1946 the local health
authority assumed responsibility for this work
and incorporated it into their maternity and child
welfare service.

On the basis of the number of marriages in
Aberdeen annually it is possible to assess that
about 30 per cent of married women in Aberdeen
have visited the local authority clinic at least
once to obtain advice on family planning. The
social-class distribution of the patients attending
is fairly representative of married women in
Aberdeen as a whole. Previous to 1964 the
vaginal diaphragm and other mechanical
methods only were advised, and were used in
about 97 per cent of cases. However, in May
1964 the oral pill was introduced, and in the ten
months till the end of March 1965 the total
number of patients increased sharply: 52 per cent
of all first attenders elected to use oral contraception. The percentage varied from thirty in
social classes I and II to seventy in classes IV
and V.

198

The fact that the increase in numbers was
least in upper-social-class women may be due
to the fact that they prefer to obtain supplies of
the pill through their family doctors. Again,
some may hesitate to use the pill because they
are aware that it acts by interfering with normal
ovarian and pituitary function. Others, too, are
alarmed by press reports of complications
following its use. Upper-social-class women
usually discuss the problem of contraception
freely with their husbands and find some more or
less satisfactory solution. The advantages of the
oral method aesthetically plus its greater effectiveness in preventing pregnancy will eventually
secure its adoption by most upper-social-class
women if its freedom from long-term toxic
effects can be assured.

Women in the semi-skilled and unskilled
occupational groups have adopted the oral
method with much less hesitation. This is not
surprising, since they now have, for the first time,
effective control of conception themselves by a
method which they can apply easily. There is
seldom much discussion of the subject of family
planning between husband and wife. Sometimes
the husband is quite unco-operative or irresponsible. Many lower-social-class-women who are

fitted with a vaginal diaphragm abandon its use,

However, some women take no effective precautions, and, when asked why, can give no
explanation. Thus apathy and ignorance on the
subject of family planning are still prevalent in

the lower social classes, though the percentage
to which this applies is getting less.

In Aberdeen the percentage of prenuptial
conceptions rises steadily from four in social
class I to nearly forty in social class V. Table 2

shows that after five years of marriage families
are largest where the first pregnancy precedes
marriage and grow steadily smaller with
lengthening of the interval between marriage and
conception. Table 3 shows that families are
largest when the mother is under twenty years of

those who conceived premaritally, tended to have
large families.

Baird and Scott found that a low intelligencetest score was associated with a high failure rate
with every method of contraception used. Onethird of the women in classes IV and V had poor
or very poor intelligence-test scores. There was a
correlation between short stature, poor physique
and health, poor living conditions, and large
family of origin. Tall women had _ higher
intelligence-test scores than short women in both
the skilled and the unskilled manual groups.
Generally speaking, the more intelligent parents
in the lower social classes have fewer children,
who in turn grow up to be taller than average
and tend to rise in the social scale on marriage
(Illsley, 1955).

The Scottish Committee for Research in
Education corroborate these findings of a coexistence of numerous favourable or adverse
circumstances: “‘There is at one end of the socioeconomic scale, the pattern of small families,
older parents, more favourable housing conditions, with children above average intelligence

age at the time of the first birth and decrease
steadily with increasing age of the mother at
matriage.

Table 4 shows the methods of contraception
in use in the various social classes in Aberdeen
five years after marriage. It will be noted that in
social classes IV and V coitus interruptus was
practised in 34 per cent and in 23 per cent of
cases no precautions were taken. It is clear that
prenuptial conception, early marriage, low social
class, and poor contraceptive technique are
characteristics of those with large families.
Baird, and Glass and Grebenik also found that
women in the lower social classes, especially

and physique, and at the other end of the scale,
the large families, low housing standards, poor
school attendance, and children below average
intelligence and physical development.”
Fairweather and Illsley have shown that a
high proportion of the mentally handicapped
children who attend a special school in Aberdeen
come from families which are characterized by
very high frequency of marital and occupational
instability, poor social conditions, high fertility,
poor physique and health, and low average
intelligence of the mother. Not infrequently
other members of the family circle have attended
the special school for the mentally handicapped.

199
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

About one-third of all the women in social
classes IV and V, slightly less than 10 per cent of
all mothers, seem incapable of regulating the
size of their families, and it is clear that family
planning clinics fail to reach them. In this respect
the work of Peberdy in Newcastle is of interest.
By home visiting of problem families to give
contraceptive advice she was able to reduce the
pregnancy rate from 130 to 23 per 100 womanyears. Voluntary sterilization and hysterectomy
played a part. The oral method of contraception
was by far the most popular. Morgan has had
success in a similar service in Southampton.

Post-partum Tubal Ligation and Therapeutic
Abortion

Tubal Ligation

As a contribution to the solution of the
problem it has for many years been the policy in

tubal ligation was 4-5 per cent. The rate rose
rapidly with increasing parity, especially after
the fifth birth. Such women were often anaemic
and suffered from chronic bronchitis. While in
many no specific “‘disease’”’ could be found, the
women were chronically tired or depressed, they
looked much older than their years, and had
great difficulty in coping with their heavy household responsibilities.

Therapeutic Abortion

In most cases the unwanted pregnancy is
accepted without too much distress and the
child welcomed into the family circle in due
course. In a few cases, however, we have been
prepared to terminate pregnancy when it seemed
in the opinion of the family doctor, the obstetrician, and a psychiatrist or general physician, as
the case may be, that the mother’s physical or

Aberdeen to perform tubal ligation in those
women who have failed to prevent pregnancy
and who find their health being undermined by
worry, malnutrition, or overwork. In the late
1930s we began to offer tubal ligation to women
between the ages of thirty-five and forty, who
might have had as many as eight or more
children. At first there was reluctance to accept
the offer, and great ignorance was displayed of
the nature of the operation and its effects.
Nevertheless the demand for the operation has
increased steadily, and now requests are received
from women under thirty who have had four
children or even fewer. By no means all of these
come from the lowest socio-economic group.
Table 5 shows that in the City of Aberdeen in
the years 1961-63 the incidence of post-partum

200

mental health might be seriously harmed if the
pregnancy continued. In arriving at our conclusions many factors may be taken into account.
Discussions take place with the family doctor
and the health visitor, and reports of home visits
by hospital social workers are studied. In a city
where all patients are referred to clinicians working in a unified and integrated obstetrical and
gynaecological service broad lines of policy can
be agreed upon. The same organization and teamwork exists in the department of mental health.
Difficult problems can be discussed more
formally at the weekly staff meetings. There is a
large measure of agreement among the Aberdeen
consultants on the present policy of both tubal
ligation and termination of pregnancy, and it has
the strong backing of the family doctors.
A FIFTH FREEDOM?

The nature of the problem varies somewhat with the social status and education of the
patient. Upper-social-class women are on the
whole in better health physically than those in
the other social classes, so that termination for
established medical disease is less common than
in the lower social classes. On the other hand,
termination for psychiatric reasons is more
common. Some professional women carry a very
heavy burden; they are vulnerable to an extra

the pregnancy terminated, but more often they
agree to continue with it so long as they have the
promise of an operation for tubal ligation in the
puerperium. The assurance that the current
pregnancy will be the last makes it possible for
many to accept the situation.

During the three years 1961-63 the following
operations to terminate pregnancy were performed on women resident in the City of
Aberdeen:

Group M consists of those who have serious disease which makes further child-bearing dangerous to life

or health.

Group P contains those women who were seriously disturbed psychiatrically, many of whom had attended

a psychiatric hospital at intervals for years.

Group P+S contains those patients who showed severe emotional upset and in addition had a very
disturbed domestic or other situation to cope with and one which could be regarded as a serious stress in a
stable woman even when not pregnant. A few had had treatment previously by a psychiatrist.

Group D+ M contains those women who showed extreme debility, usually associated with excessive
child-bearing. They did not suffer from one of the recognized categories of disease, as did those grouped
under “‘medical’’, but they were far from well, were usually anaemic and lethargic, and looked much older

than their years.

The same type of problem can, of course,
occur in the lowest socio-economic group.
However, usually the emphasis is rather different.
In the first place, women in the lowest socioeconomic groups are less accustomed to longterm planning. They usually start by renting a
room, often from relatives, and by the time three
or four children have arrived in quick succession
they may find themselves in a local authority
house, but possibly unable to cope physically and
financially with the situation. Some ask to have

In many cases the indications are multiple,
but an attempt has been made to divide them
into five cause groups (Table 6).

Table 7 shows that the incidence of termination was highest in women who had had four
viable children, particularly those who were
thirty years of age or more. Women in this
parity group constitute 12 per cent of the childbearing population, but 35 per cent of the

201
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

women who have had hysterotomy and tubal

termination is greater than in any other parity
group, the most important single indication
being anxiety or depression and adverse social
and environmental circumstances. Overcrowding
and the care of ageing parents may become
difficult problems about this time. Forty per cent
of the women in this parity group belong to

have the educational and financial resources to
cope adequately with such problems.

employed being determined by the duration of
the pregnancy.

Nineteen out of the twenty-four were under
twenty-five years of age, five of them being under
twenty (three were schoolgirls of sixteen years).
The indication in seven was medical; in fourteen,
psychiatric (usually severe depression); and in
three, psychiatric plus environmental factors.

Hysterotomy Without Tubal Ligation

This operation was performed only three
times, the indications being psychiatric. The
small number illustrates that as a rule in married
women with other children, if the condition is
serious enough to warrant laparotomy and
hysterotomy, tubal ligation is also indicated.

Curettage

This procedure was used to relieve an acute
temporary situation in relatively young women
of low parity. For example, 50 per cent had had
fewer than three full-time pregnancies, compared
with 25 per cent in those where hysterotomy and
tubal ligation was performed. The most common
indication for termination was a severe psychiatric disturbance (45 per cent), while emotional
distress plus very unfavourable social circumstances came second (25 per cent).

population of the city. Many were over thirtyfive years of age. Post-partum tubal ligation was
performed most commonly in women from the
lowest social classes who had had four or more
children. |

Hall, as a result of a questionnaire sent to
sixty-five obstetrical hospitals in the USA, found
great differences in the practice with regard to
termination of pregnancy, tubal ligation, and
contraceptive advice. He discusses in more detail
the practice at the Sloane Hospital, New York.
Here the incidence of therapeutic abortion in
the years 1956-60 was 1 in 429 in ward and
1 in 111 in private patients. Only a very small
percentage of ward patients received advice at
the hospital contraceptive clinic, while contraceptive advice was easily available to all private
patients. Dr. Hall’s conclusions are: “The
obstetrician’s obligation to provide abortion,
sterilization and contraception is inadequately
and inequitably met at the moment. The
obstetricians of America must individually and
collectively review these vital issues in an effort
to establish a more uniformly humane birth
control ethic.”

Assessment of Results
Health of the Mother

In Aberdeen many of the women who have had
tubal ligation have been kept under observation
for years. The most obvious finding is the
improvement in general family well-being, with
a more congenial home atmosphere, better
marital relations, and obvious improvement in
the mental health of the women.

In the case of termination of pregnancy
followed by tubal ligation there may be a greater
risk of psychological consequences. This is
difficult to assess, and is being studied by the
department of mental health.

One of the most comprehensive follow-up
studies is that of Ekblad in Denmark, where
tubal ligation and/or termination of pregnancy
can be performed on eugenic and medical
grounds. Ekblad followed up 225 women who
were sterilized during 1951 on psychiatric or
eugenic grounds or because of “weakness’’—
85 per cent of them had a pregnancy terminated
in addition. He found that psychiatric and

neurotic symptoms were no more common than
one might expect in the population generally.
In those who had been psychiatrically disturbed
the results were very good. In general, Ekblad’s
experience agrees with our findings that the
results of hysterotomy and tubal ligation are
most satisfactory.

Perinatal Mortality

It is well recognized that the perinatal
mortality is now highest in the para-4+ group.
For example, in the National Birthday Trust
Survey of 1958 the rate was 50 per 1,000. As has
been stated earlier, the percentage of women
having a fifth or subsequent maternity (viable
child) increases from 7 per cent in the South of
England to 12 per cent in the North. It is
16 per cent in Glasgow and Clydeside. The fact
that the Aberdeen percentage is slightly less
than seven is the result of our determination to
help all mothers to have the number of children
they desire and also because we have made a
special effort to help those who are least able to
look after themselves. In Aberdeen the para-4+
group contributed approximately 9 per cent of
all perinatal deaths and in Glasgow about
20 per cent—a very substantial proportion of the
high overall perinatal mortality in that city.

Maternal Mortality

Thirty years ago excessive child-bearing was a
very important cause of maternal mortality. In
the years 1938-47 in Aberdeen two-thirds of the
women in whom hysterotomy and tubal ligation
was performed had had seven or more children;
by 1958 only 20 per cent were in this category.
In the years 1961-63 only 17 per cent had had
five or more previous children. This decline in
the number of elderly women of high parity has
been an important factor in the decline in
maternal mortality.

The number of deaths following therapeutic
abortion is very low. Goodhart has estimated
that 104 deaths followed illegal abortion in the
years 1958-60 in England and Wales. This would
give a case mortality about equal to that of
maternal mortality from all other causes if, as
some have estimated, the number of such
operations is as high as 100,000 annually.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

The incidence of therapeutic abortion in
Aberdeen is about 2 per cent of all maternities,
and there seems to be very little termination of
pregnancy by unqualified persons, possibly
because women know that their difficulties will
receive sympathetic and unprejudiced consideration from the medical profession in Aberdeen.
Certainly septic abortion is very rarely seen.

Conclusions

In the past as the standard of living rose the
average number of children per family fell and
these changes occurred gradually, keeping pace
with rising standards of education. But recently
in the underdeveloped countries the rapid control
of infection by chemotherapy, without a corresponding increase in the standard of living and
education, has led to very rapid increases in
population, which make comprehensive policies
of population control essential if economic
development is not to be hindered. Even in
countries with a high standard of living the
population increase constitutes a threat to the
quality of life.

The contraceptive pill is a great advance on
any of the previous methods available, and if its
freedom from long-term toxic effects can be
assured should greatly decrease the need for the
clumsy and unattractive mechanical methods
now in use. Nevertheless, for the woman who
has finished with child-bearing by the age of
thirty the prospect of taking pills for 15 to 20
years is not a very attractive one. In such cases
tubal ligation has much to commend it, and it
should be accepted by society as a right and
proper alternative.

No matter which method is used, unplanned
pregnancies will occur, and sometimes their
continuance will seriously endanger the mother’s
health and her effectiveness as a mother. Such
cases should be carefully assessed and pregnancy
terminated when the weight of evidence strongly
points to the advantages of this step.

One might ask who is to be considered in
these matters. Are good parents doing their best
for their children to have their plans upset by
having no escape from the accident of an un
204

wanted pregnancy? Is it fair to bring a child
into a pathologically disturbed environment? In
a world where there are too many children should
women be forced to endure this tyranny of
unwanted pregnancies? If the answer is no, we
must plan accordingly.

In Britain this means making contraceptive
advice freely available under the National Health
Service and offering tubal ligation to women
who have had the desired number of children.
This would help to free women from the
tyranny of unwanted pregnancies and also make
them more independent and able to choose
freely how they will use their training and skills,
especially after their desired number of children
have been born.

To quote Huxley: “The progress of medical
science, besides accomplishing control of disease,
must also improve the quality of life by providing
greater fulfilment for more human beings.
Fulfilment in this sense involves physical, mental
and spiritual well-being.”

To achieve this the world needs a Fifth
Freedom—freedom from the tyranny of civilized
man’s excessive fertility.
