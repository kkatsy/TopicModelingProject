Cousin Marriages

HAT DO WE KNOW about the results
\ / \ | of marriages between cousins? Before
we think of the scientific evidence it is
worth while taking note of what people in general
believe. We find, in fact, two sharply contrasting
opinions in different communities such as those
recorded in Table 1. On the one hand, there are
large communities where cousin marriage is
rare; this is true of most Protestants in England.
Among these such marriage is thought to produce defective offspring with an unduly high
frequency. On the other hand, there are small
communities and also certain families in large
communities where cousin marriage is frequent;
this is true of religious minorities everywhere.
Among these the opposite opinion is held:
people maintain that no special frequency of
defects is to be found in the offspring of cousin
marriages.

The Scientific Approach

Scientific opinion, so far as I am aware, has
largely ignored this popular disagreement.
George Darwin, prompted by his father’s
remarks at the end of The Descent of Man, was
the first to attack the problem. He, like the

geneticists who have followed him, was concerned with studying the effect of cousin marriage
in the large communities where it is rare. They
noticed that certain genes, being recessive, are
expressed more frequently in the offspring of
cousin marriages because these offspring are
more homozygous than the offspring of outbred
families. Further (as was pointed out by William
Bateson in 1902) the rarer the gene the greater
will be this effect. Thus, about 30 per cent of
individuals showing alcaptonuria are said to be
the offspring of first cousin marriages in an
English population where only 1 per cent of
marriages are of this kind; that is thirty times
too high. And this concentration agrees with the
low frequency of the alcaptonuria gene which
expresses itself in only about one in a million of
the whole population.

Thus, certain kinds of rare defective conditions
are much commoner in the offspring of cousin
marriages in communities where such marriages
are the exception. In small inbred communities
where such marriages occur regularly the situation will be different, for the defects will appear
more quickly after their origin by mutation and
will thus be the more quickly eliminated by the
lower viability or lower fertility of those who
show them. The community will, therefore,
become, as we may say, adapted to inbreeding.
Now, we may ask, are these effects responsible
for the differences in popular belief concerning
the dangers of cousin marriage? And are they
enough to account for the prohibition of cousin

marriage by certain religious authorities, or of
incest in general?

These questions are, I believe, and as Darwin
believed, fundamental for the understanding of
the genetics of human society. But we must not
expect to answer them by applying any single
quick and easy formula. We need, first, to distinguish sharply between families and communities according to whether they are inbred
or outbred. Secondly, we need to examine, as a
whole, the descendants of first cousin marriages
over a standard period. I have chosen the period
up to the birth of the great-grandchildren.
Thirdly, we need to follow a standardized
procedure for recording the results. I have
chosen to ignore illegitimate births and stillbirths and to record live births, survivals to
maturity (twenty-one to twenty-five), and
marriages with or without issue. Families with
many divorces and violent deaths must be
excluded. Otherwise all selection must be
avoided so far as possible.

A number of special kinds of procedure are
available within this general framework. We can
begin with historical instances such as the
cousin marriages of royalty or of notabilities in
general. Or we can begin, as I did in one series,
with the grandchildren of cousin marriages
approached by newspaper enquiry. We must in
any case classify the results by the numbers of
children and by the period of the marriage in
order that we can compare the results with
suitable groups of non-cousin marriages. And
finally we ought to make as thorough a medical
study as possible of a representative sample of
families.

Fertility of Cousin Marriages
My studies along these lines have gone far
enough for me to state certain conclusions.

(1) Cousin marriages in inbred communities,
as popularly believed, have no ill effect whatever.

(2) In outbred communities the numbers of
children born alive to first cousins are no fewer
than in other marriages.

(3) But in their survival to maturity, in the
frequency of marriage and in the proportion of
fruitful marriages these children are at a disadvantage.

(4) In the next generation they may or may
not recover in viability and fertility.

In consequence of these differences I may
summarise the results of a first and provisional
analysis of fifty-eight fruitful first cousin
marriages.

It will be seen that the royal stocks are not
adversely affected. But the outbred stocks,
originally more fertile, are failing to maintain
themselves in the second and third generations.
Thus we see from Table 2 that the twenty-two
royal marriages (inbred) produced a total of
ninety-four children, i.e. 4-3 children per marriage
with issue. (For this generation ‘“‘marriage with
issue” and “original marriage” are of course
identical.) Of these nimety-four children seventythree married and produced 221 issue, i.e.
4.3 per marriage with issue (fifty-one) or ten
per original marriage (of the grandparents).
In the next generation there is a total of 504
progeny, i.e. 3-7 per marriage with issue (137)
or 22-9 per original marriage (of the greatgrandparents). By contrast, the number of issue
per original marriage in the non-royal (outbred)
COUSIN MARRIAGES

families increases at a much slower rate after the
first generation.

The medical study of my correspondence will
be of interest. My correspondents were often
able to explain a failure to have children or the
low survival and fertility rates in their families in
medical terms. Insanity, blindness, tuberculosis,
cancer, epilepsy, diabetes, pyloric stenosis, heart
disease, intersexuality, and in women, acute
dysmenorrhoea, toxaemia of pregnancy, miscarriage and difficult parturition, were quoted.

In addition to such defined or definable
medical conditions it is clear that many undefined
conditions, which are not usually regarded as the
object of medical study, play a part. Such are the
admitted absence of sexual desire, or delay in
marriage, or marrying a partner much older
than oneself. These conditions most contribute
to the loss of fertility if they are, as they seem to
be, unduly frequent in the offspring of cousin
marriages. For the first time such conditions are
seen as being genetically determined. For in the
environment there is nothing peculiar to the
progeny of cousin marriages in outbred populations. What is peculiar is solely in their genetic
condition. Whether that condition is to be
described in terms of Mendelian recessives or
polygenic systems need not concern us at this
Stage.

The Double Marriage Test

In the course of my correspondence I learnt of
one crucial type of test for giving results of the
greatest statistical efficiency. It is the use of a
double marriage test. A man or a woman of an
outbred community marries two spouses, one a
cousin, the other unrelated. There are several
children by each marriage. From these children
complete families of grandchildren are available.
I now have five such instances all tending to
show a reduction in the numbers of descendants
of the inbred marriage as compared with the
outbred. I will quote two examples: the best
known, that of Johann Sebastian Bach; the
most emphatic, that of Lord Henley.

I should be grateful to any correspondent who
could inform me of other complete and authentic
examples of this situation. Another three or four
instances might well be decisive for they represent in every respect what an experimental

breeder would require if he were experimenting
with human genetics.

From the way I have stated the problem of
cousin marriage it will be seen that it is closely
related to another problem: do the progenies of
exceptional outbreeding also show a reduction of
fertility? We know hardly any more about this
question than T. H. Huxley did when he discussed it in 1865. It is usually said that crosses
between different races of men suffer from no
reduction of fertility. I do not believe it. My
experience suggests that the parts of every
population are adapted to one another and to the
breeding system they have followed; every
change in that system upsets the regularity of the
result. But at present I see no easy way of
discovering the evidence from race-crossing in
man.
