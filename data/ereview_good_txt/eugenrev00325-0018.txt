_MIGRATION IN RELATION TO
RACIAL PROBLEMS.

By A. M. Carr-SaAuNDERS.

That migration in past times has had much to do with the shaping
of the national and international problems that face us to-day is an
obvious truism. Had Asiatic instead of European races replaced the
Indians in North America the world would wear an aspect entirely
different from that which it presents to-day. When we consider the
great importance of the matter it cannot be said that the migrations of
past times have received an adequate degree of attention. We know
little about the facts and less about the causes. But it is not of migrations in the past but of contemporary movements that I propose to
write and I shall limit what I have to say to a consideration of movements within the British Empire.

Since the war the importance of migration has received widespread recognition. This is due in the first place to the dislocations
following upon the war and in the second place to the restrictions upon
movement set up by certain Governments, notably by that of the
United States of America. Migration has entered the field of international relations and has become, in addition to all the pre-existing
aspects of international relations, a possible cause of friction. As an
instance of the interest now taken in migration reference may be made
to the World Migration Congress convened by the International Federation of Trade Unions and held in London in June 1926. As a result
of this Congress a useful volume entitled ‘‘World Migration and
Labour’’* has been published.

Owing to the initiative of the International Labour Office adequate
material for the study of migration has recently been made available.
At the fourth session of the International Labour Conference a recommendation was adopted concerning the collection of information by
each member of the International Labour Organisation. This information was summarised in a publication called ‘‘Migration Movements’ ’ +
1920—1923. Information is now regularly received from all members
and is published separately in the Monthly Record of Migration. The
form in which the information is collected has been greatly improved

upon the advice of the International Labour Office. Thus we are now
in possession of data surpassing in value anything previously available.
The International Labour Office has also performed a useful service in
publishing a volume summarising existing laws and treaties dealing
with migration. *

We are interested in these data so far as they ¢ concern racial problems within the British Empire. Now racial problems, in the strict
sense of problems connected with inherited qualities, may be considered in relation to migration under two headings. In the first
place we may ask in respect to any country whether those whom it is
receiving by immigration or losing by emigration are above or below
the average of the population in their innate endowments. Since
there is now no doubt that there are vast differences between one
person and another in respect of innate endowments, mental and
‘physical, there is here a very important problem. I propose to con‘sider the present position of this country in relation to this problem.
In the second place we may ask whence the immigrants come who enter
‘any country. It is not so clear how far this in the strict sense of the
‘word is a racial problem. It is not clear how far the average representatives of different European nations are racially distinct. We
do not know how far inherited differences play a part in producing
differences between Englishmen, Germans and Italians for instance.
But there would probably be a fair measure of agreement that southern
Europeans do possess inherited temperamental andemotional qualities
that differ somewhat from those of Englishmen and Germans. Therefore we may assume that the peopling of the Dominions from southern
Europe instead of from Great Britain would have racial as well as
cultural importance and I propose to examine the position of the
Dominions from this point of view.

Let us first take the problem of whose who enter the United
Kingdom. The Aliens Order of 1920 issued under the Aliens Act
of 1914 and 1919 lays down that lunatics, idiots, mental defectives
and those whom a medical inspector certifies as undesirable on medical
grounds shall not be permitted to land. In 1925 881,703 aliens
landed and 80 were refused permission to land. Since only one alien
‘in about 4770 was refused permission to land it does not look as though
‘the medical requirements were any too high. It should perhaps be
explained that the number of aliens landing only exceeded the numbers
of those departing by 821 and that therefore the addition of the popula‘tion from this source was negligible. But it does not follow on this
‘account that the racial qualities of alien immigrants are of no im.portance and there does not seem to be any sufficient assurance that
‘racially undesirable persons are excluded.

Immigration into Great Britain is of trival importance compared
-with emigation from Great Britain. The volume of emigration has
‘fluctuated considerably. Before the war it was tending to become
-absolutely larger and relative to the rate of natural increase more important as the following figures show.

There do not seem to be any figures which enable us to compare
the volume of migration from Great Britain with that from other
European countries in pre-war days. Owing, however, to the work of
the International Labour Office referred to above, post-war comparisons are possible. Figures have been prepared showing the net loss by
overseas migration of nationals per 100,000 inhabitants from the
chief European countries. This net loss is arrived at by subtracting
from the total overseas emigration of nationals the total overseas immigration, that is to say repatriation, of nationals during the period
-1920—1928.

No other country for which figures 4 are given shows a loss of 200 per
100,000 inhabitants. The figures bring out the fact that relatively to
other European countries Great Britain is a great exporter of men.
Who are these men and where do they go?

We can pass over the earlier part of the last century which was
marked by the transportation of convicts on the one hand and various
efforts to encourage emigration on the other hand. Let us glance at
the period from 1870 to the present day. During the whole of this
period (the war years excepted) anyone who had the means was permitted to leave if he wished. But in other respects a distinction must
be drawn between the pre-war and post-war periods. In the pre-war
period there was no financial assistance of emigrants from Government
funds and no restrictions generally speaking as to numbers entering
other countries or as to standards of physique and health. When we
put our two questions in respect of this period we find that we have no
certain information enabling us to reply to the first question—as to
MIGRATION IN RELATION TO RACIAL PROBLEMS. 305

what type of man it was who left. Since except in the case of those
obtaining assistance from voluntary societies the emigrants were
persons with some means and presumably also with some energy and
ambition, it seems reasonable to imagine that they were if anything
above the average. To this country emigration probably meant a
loss in the racial sense. When we put the second question and ask
where they went the answer is that they went almost exclusively to the
United States of America and to the Dominions. Up to about 4900
the United States took roughly two-fifths to three-quarters of our
emigrants. After 1900 the Dominions took an increasing proportion
until immediately before the war the United States were taking only
about one-fifth. Thus in the later part of this period the loss to this
country was only in small part a loss to the Empire.

Let us now examine the post-war period. As before the war
anyone can leave who desires to do so and has the necessary means.
But in addition there are schemes of Government assisted emigration
from this country. An additional new factor is the tendency for
immigrant receiving countries to set up standards of physique which
immigrants must reach and to restrict the numbers of immigrants.
Restriction upon members of immigrants is enforced by the American
law. The quota system in its first form allowed an annual immigration of
77,206 from Great Britain and Ireland, and in its present form allows an
annual immigration of 34,000 from Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and 28,000 from the Irish Free State. After the first of July 1927 new
arrangements are to come into force and it is estimated that they will
allow the entry of something over 90,000 persons from Great Britain
and Ireland.

The setting up of standards which immigrants must satisfy is
now almost universal. Since it is the standards demanded by the
United States of America and by the Dominions which alone are of
direct interest to us we may pass over the regulations imposed by
other countries, though it is of interest to note that countries such as
Costa Rica and Ecuador, not generally regarded as pioneers in social
legislation, exclude whole classes of mentally and physically defective
persons and those suffering from diseases such as tuberculosis. The
United States exclude any person suffering from tuberculosis in any
form; idiots, imbeciles, feeble-minded; insane persons; persons who
have had one or more attacks of insanity at any previous time; persons
of constitutional psychopathic inferiority; persons with chronic
alcoholism ; persons certified by the examining surgeon to be mentally
or physically defective, such physical defect being of a nature which
may affect the ability of a person to earn a living. The Canadian
regulations are very similar, and exclude among others persons afflicted
with tuberculosis in any form, persons of constitutional psychopathic
inferiority, the mentally defective and the dumb, blind and otherwise
physically defective. Australia excludes among others those suffering
from a serious transmissible disease or defect, from pulmonary tuberculosis or trachoma ; the mentally defective and the insane.

These regulations, desirable as they are from the point of view of
an immigrant receiving country, are serious from the point of view of
an emigrant exporting country. As noted above, it was probably true
306 _ EUGENICS REVIEW.

that in former days emigrants from this country were above the average:
of the population in respect of their innate qualities—mental and.
physical. As a result of this legislation this is certainly now the case.
The countries whither our emigrants go will only take the better of
our people. But this is not all. There is now a considerable volume
of assisted migration under the Empire Settlement Act of 1922, and in
respect of those assisted still higher standards are required. .

This Act. permits the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to
make and carry out agreed schemes for emigration to and settlement
in the Dominions. The schemes may be agreed with the Dominion
governments, public or private organisations in this country, provided
that the contributions from public funds should not exceed one half the
cost of any one scheme or exceed in all £3,000,000 in any one year.
Under this Act about 40,000 persons are assisted annually to emigrate.
Not quite half those assisted are children... Very roughly speaking
rather more than half of these assisted persons go to Australia, rather
less than a quarter to Canada and New Zealand respectively. It is of
some interest to note, in view of what will be said later, that assisted
immigrants form a much higher proportion of all immigrants in the
cases of Australia and New Zealand than in the case of Canada. About
two out of every three going to Australia and about eight out of every
eleven going to New Zealand are assisted.

The importance of the Empire Settlement Act in relation to racial
problems in this country arises from the fact that the volume of assisted
emigration under the Act is large, amounting to about half the present
net annual loss by migration, and that the requirements relating te
physique are more stringent than in the case of those emigrating without assistance. It does not, however, appear to be possible to
ascertain what these standards are. Circulars are issued by the
Ministry of Labour for the use of members of Juvenile Advisory
Committees and for the guidance of Local Education Authorities containing some definite indications as to standards. But these circulars
are confidential and thus the public is contributing through taxation
to the carrying out of a scheme the nature of which it does not know
and the effect of which it cannot accurately judge. Since, however,
some indication of the nature of these standards inevitably reaches
many persons because they are interested in the migration of particular
boys and girls or for other reasons, there are very widespread impressions as to what the requirements are which are probably well
founded. It is understood, for example, that there are standard
heights and weights which must be reached at certain ages and that
no boy or girl wearing glasses can be accepted in any case for Australia. There can be no doubt that the requirements whatever they
may precisely be are high and are rigorously exacted. I have been
told that in one city before would-be boy emigrants are sent to the
medical officer for the official test, they are carefully examined and
many are eliminated. Nevertheless, in spite of all the care taken in
selecting boys to be examined, some fifty per cent. are turned down at
the test by the medical officer. The attention of the Inter-departmental Committee appointed to consider the effect on migration of |
schemes of social insurance was called to this matter. The report.
MIGRATION IN RELATION TO RACIAL PROBLEMS. 3807

‘contains the following sentence. ‘‘We have received the impression
that the standards, especially the height standards, might be applied
with more elasticity.’’

It does not seem that so high a premium is placed upon good
intelligence as upon good physique. Certificates as to good character
are required and boys from reformatory schools are not acceptable.
Some of the assisted schemes, the Big Brother Movement, for instance,
which encourages the emigration of boys -between 15 and 19 to Australia, lay down that the boy must have been at least in the sixth
standard at an elementary school. There is also the scheme for the
migration of secondary school boys to New Zealand. Since a large
proportion of secondary school boys—I believe taking the country as a
whole about a third,—have won free places from elementary schools
it is evident that such a scheme as this takes from among the best of our
intellectually endowed youngsters.

It is probable that, unless migration takes the form of mass
migration as after the Irish famine, it is always racially disadvantageous. The better’ endowed select themselves for migration. Our
present policy is designed to exaggerate this selective aspect of migration. We are committed to spending up to £3,000,000 a year upon
the exportation of those who pass a rigorous test of fitness. I am not
concerned here with financial considerations, but since it is often
assumed that the cost of working the Act is the total expense in connection with migration which falls upon this country, I might remark
that the cost of bringing into the world, feeding, clothing, educating
and caring generally for boys who on reaching working age then leave
the country cannot be left out of account. No one seems to have
estimated the cost of putting a boy of fourteen upon the labour market
but I do not see how it would work out at less than £400.

So far we have been considering the racial effects of migration upon
this country. When we turn to consider the Dominions then we find
that they received in 1925 85% of all our emigrants. When in addition we remember that the Dominions received all the most rigourously
selected emigrants, namely, those assisted under the Act, it is clear
that our loss is almost wholly their gain. But this is not the whole of
the story so far as emigration affects the Dominions, because they
receive immigrants from countries other than Great Britain. As noted
above it is very doubtful what racial importance to attribute to the
entry of persons of nationalities other than British into the Dominions.
Nevertheless it is probably correct to assume that the importance of
this immigration is not wholly cultural. We may attempt to review
the facts leaving it to others to draw what conclusions they may please
from them.

The Censuses of the Dominions give an indication of the racial
composition of their populations. In the cases of Australiaand New
Zealand it is no more than an indication because all we have is a record
of the birthplace of those enumerated. It follows that we can gather
nothing directly from the information given in any one census as to
the racial origin of those recorded as born in Australia. Their parents
‘might have come from anywhere. But since this information is given
in each census it is possible to construct a comparative. table. whence
808 EUGENICS REVIEW.

some information can be derived as to where the parents of those born
in Australia did come from.

This table can be amplified by another table showing the birthplaces of those born in Europe by countries. The only countries in
which more than 100,000 persons were born and living in Australia
at the time of the census were England and Wales, Scotland and
Ireland. The other countries are omitted with the exception of
Germany and Italy which are included in order to show the relative
unimportance of the other countries as contributors to the peopling
of Australia.

It follows that the great part, probably well over 90% of the
population of Australia, is descended from persons of British and Irish
stock. The Irish, who formerly contributed largely, now contribute
on a smaller scale, to the peopling of Australia. Those descended
from persons of continental European stock are almost negligible and
among them Germans and northern Europeans are far more numerous
than southern Europeans. The Danes, for instance, have relatively
to their small population at home and to the small contributions made
by any continental European country, made considerable contributions
to the population of Australia and New Zealand. There has been an
increasing tendency for Italians to enter Australia, but since in 1921
only some 8,000 persons resident in Australia were born in Italy as
against 570,000 born in Great Britain the Italian contribution is still
negligible.

These figures refer to 1921. How, it may be asked, have the
American immigration laws affected the position? America is now
nearly closéd to Italians and other races of southern and eastern
Europe. The following figures throw some light upon the problem.

It appears that while in 1925 there was an increase in the net immigration of Italians (4,839 as against 3,978 in 1924) there was decrease in
the figures for Greeks and Jugoslavs. The present conditions seem to
encourage an increase of Italian immigration though not of other
continental Europeans.

The 1921 Census of New Zealand reveals much the same state of
affairs. The population of this Dominion is, however, even more
British and Irish than that of Australia. Further, the Irish play a
rather smaller part. Of the inhabitants of New Zealand in 1921
98-43%, were born in British countries and 1-47% in foreign countries.
The proportion born in British countries has risen fairly steadily from
census to census. Thus in 1871 96% were British born and 4% foreign
born. Anaylsing the British born resident in New Zealand in 1921
by country of birth, we find 74-39% born in New Zealand, 12-26% in
England, -21% in Wales, 4-24% in Scotland and 2-83% in Ireland.
Though we do not know the place of birth of the ancestors of the New
Zealand born we can use the same argument as in the case of Australia
and deduce from a comparison of the table of birth-places census by
census that over 95% of the present inhabitants of New Zealand are of
British or Irish stock. |

As in the case of Australia we may ask whether post-war conditions
have influenced the situation. The following information throws some
light upon this point. In 1925, 15,704 immigrants arrived with the
intention of residing permanently. Of them 14,810 were British
Subjects and 894 were aliens. In 1924, 833 aliens were recorded as
310 EUGENICS REVIEW.

intending to reside permanently. The racial origin of these aliens is.
shown in the following table, and again the increase of Italians and the
decline of Jugo-Slavs is to be noted. |

Canadian figures tell a very different story. The following figures.
give an anlysis of the Canadian population at each of the last three
censuses showing the racial origins of those enumerated.

The chief constituent element of the other European group is the
French. They formed 27-91% of the total in 1921, 28-52% in 1911
and 30-70 in 1901. Analysing the British element in 1921, we find
29-5% to be English, 12-6% Irish and 18-3% Scotch. Canada is
then strongly contrasted with Australia and New Zealand. Rather
more than half the population is of British descent as compared with
well over 90% in the case of the other two Dominions. But over a
quarter is of French descent, thus leaving only some 12% as of European
descent other than British, Irish or French. It is noticeable that in
1921 no continental nation other than the French contributed over
2% to the population of Canada.

When we come to ask how post-war conditions have affected
Canadian immigration, the answer would seem to be that the effect
is far more marked than in the case of Australia and New Zealand.

During the year ending 31 March, 1926, 96,064 immigrants arrived
MIGRATION IN RELATION TO RACIAL PROBLEMS. 31!

in Canada. Of these 37,030 came from the British Isles, 18,778 from
the United States and 40,256 from other foreign countries. It is.
noticeable that more immigrants came from foreign countries (not
including among them the United States) than from Great Britain and
Ireland. The figures for the first six months of 1926 show an exaggeration of the same tendency. Over 70,000 immigrants entered, of whom
less than 28,000 came from the British Isles, about 10,000 from the
United States and over 32,000 from other foregin countries. Canada,
where there is no restriction upon numbers entering, as in the United
States, is clearly receiving some of those who cannot enter the latter
country.

I do not propose to deal with the Union of South Africa because
Kuropean immigration is nearly at a standstill. It is well known that
nearly 70% of the population is native. Of the 16% of Europeans.
resident in 1921 and born outside the Union, 12% were born in British
countries, and thus what immigration there has been lately has mostly
come from British countries.

What conclusions are we to draw from these analyses of the racial
origins of the inhabitants of the great Dominions? Canada has hitherto.
been peopled preponderantly by British and French, living side by side,
but not intermarrying to any considerable degree. It looks as though
Canada is about to make much the same experiment as the United
States have made, and to receive additions to her population from many
sources. We must anticipate racial mixture by intermarriage as in
the United States. What this implies in terms of race biology noone, I think, can say. Australia and New Zealand are almost wholly
British. New Zealand indeed might be now appropriately called New
England. The present indications are that these two great Dominions
will remain British. There is a strong sentiment against the entry of
continental Europeans in any numbers. Further, their great distance
means a costly voyage and, in fact, were it not for assisted emigration
from this country, they would be receiving few intending settlers.
Should this anticipation prove to be correct, should the population of
these two great Dominions remain almost wholly of British stock,
then the peopling of Australia and New Zealand will turn out to be an
event almost unique in race biology as well as in political history, whatever it may imply in either sphere. Other migrants have usually
found an existing population with which they have intermarried, and
the migrants have not uncommonly themselves been mixed as in the
case of those going to South America. But the British found Australia
and New Zealand empty for all practical purposes. The aborigines
have dwindled and there has been no considerable intermarriage. If
British stock peoples these great areas to the exclusion of other stocks.
it will be an almost uniyjue event,
