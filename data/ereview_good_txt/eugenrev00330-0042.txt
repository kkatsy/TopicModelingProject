STUDIES IN HEREDITARY ABILITY.
By Mr. W. T. J. Gun.

{Note.—In the accompanying charts all persons, the dates of whose
births and deaths are given, appear in the Dictionary of National
Biography, referred to in the article as D.N.B. A few so marked
are still living, but will undoubtedly find a place in future issues
of D.N.B.}.

It is proposed in this article, which is confined to families of British
origin, to deal more particularly with descents through female lines,
which, in comparison with direct male descents, are apt to be overlooked. A certain number of tables in this connection were drawn
up by the late Sir Francis Galton in his ‘‘Hereditary Genius,’’ but in
very few instances did he trace out all possible connections of note.
The writer has compiled a large number of charts, which it is hoped
may supplement Galton’s researches, some of these charts are
appended hereto, a selection having been made from those connections which were little, if at all, touched on by Sir Francis. Mention
in D.N.B. has been taken as a rough test of ability, but it is fully
recognised that some individuals so mentioned owed their position
more to extrinsic circumstances than to intrinsic qualities and must
be admitted to tables of ability with extreme caution.

From the various charts compiled the writer has endeavoured to
ascertain whether ability is on the whole more likely to descend
through the father or through the mother ; the test from D.N.B.
would certainly seem to indicate paternal predominance, but having
regard to the advantages accruing to the male line, family influence
and tradition, the very name itself, it seems probable that such predominance, if it really exists at all, is very slight.

Taking English history as a whole, there seems little doubt that
among distinct family connections, the greatest number of noteworthy
names occur among the descendants of Sir William Sidney, father of
the well-known Sir Henry, and grandfather of the still better known
Sir Philip ; and among the descendants of Sir George Villiers, the
father of James the First’s favourite, Buckingham.

Each of these two connections, the Sidney and the Villiers,
contains well over one hundred names mentioned separately in
D.N.B. The Sidney connection has been to a certain extent dealt
with by Galton, ‘‘Hereditary Genius,’’ p. 88, but he altogether overleoked the Villiers connection, the most noteworthy names in which
wil be found in Chart 1, descendants of Sir George Villiers by his
first wife, Audrey Sanders, and in Chart 2 descendants of the same
by his second wife, Mary Beaumont. The most famous individuals
noted are the first Duke of Marlborough, the Duke of Berwick, Lord
Chatham and his son William Pitt, Charles James Fox, the brothers
Sir Charles and Sir William Napier, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu,
Henry Fielding and Lord Castlereagh. In later times four Prime
Ministers belonged also to this connection, Lord John Russell, Lord
Aberdeen, Lord Derby and Lord Salisbury. |

From Chart 1 it will be observed that although the greatest names
82 EUGENICS REVIEW.

do not occur till the 18th century, there was much ability in the 17th,
though this ability was not of a very distinguished kind, being chiefly
in fact the power of attracting monarchs! In addition to Buckingham
himself, Barbara Villiers Duchess of Cleveland, Arabella Churchill,
and Elizabeth Villiers Countess of Orkney, were mistresses of successive kings, Charles II, James I, and William III. This hereditary
power of charming was very evident later in Marlborough, and to a
certain extent also in Chatham, who it will be noted was doubly
descended from Sir George Villiers. Pride and haughtiness, so
strongly exhibited in the notorious Barbara Villiers were very characteriste of the Pitts, and also of Castlereagh, but reached their acme in
Lady Hester Stanhope, coupled with a marked eccentricity, noticeable
also in the selfish voluptuary, the third Marquis of Hertford, the
original of Thackeray’s Lord Steyne, and to an extreme extent in the
Hervey family, whose individualities were so marked that Lady Mary
Montagu said of them ‘‘ the world consists of men, women and
Herveys.’’ This eccentricity, together with much ability, descended
from the Herveys to the Stanleys of Alderley, coming down to very
recent times.

Ability, after lying dormant for some time, re-appeared in the
male line of the Villiers family in the well-known Foreign Secretary
of last century, the 4th Earl of Clarendon, and in several of his
immediate relatives. It is interesting to note that this particular
family descended also from Edward Hyde, the great Lord Clarendon
of that family, and in the direct female line from the Jatter’s great
enemy, Oliver Cromwell. This is almost a unique case of a family
of distinction in the 19th century, with so many ancestcrs of note in
the 17th, and so little apparent ability in the intervening period.

Powers of command coupled with powers of charm were perhaps
the most salient features of the Villiers connection, but the ability
displayed was obviously very varied, and becomes still more marked
when we include the descendants of the second family, set out in
Chart 2, when we can add to Lord Hervey the memoir writer, the
greater writer of the same style, Lady Mary, the novelist Henry
Fielding, and the historian, Sir William Napier, a galaxy of firstclass literary talent, while powers of charm reached their acme in
Charles Fox.

In the second family, however, there is a greater lack of continuity of ability than in the first, and Lady Mary and Fielding
possibly owe their powers more to other descents. Still more is this.
possible in the case of the descendants of the 2nd Duke of Richmond,.
of whom Fox and the Napiers are the most prominent, as these
belong also to another connection, the Waller, which is included in
Chart 2. From two first cousins, Sir Hardress and Sir William
Waller, both famous in the Civil Wars, sprang three lines of note.
From Sir William, the Harcourt, subsequently Vernon-Harcourt line,
from Sir Hardress the Petty-Fitzmaurices and the Richmond subconnection, and it will be seen that ability in each line persisted for
several generations, particularly perhaps in the Harcourts.

It is interesting to note that the very eugenic marriage of the
2nd Duke and Duchess of Richmond was arranged by the parents:
STUDIES IN HEREDITARY ABILITY. 83

on each side when the parties were very young, to satisfy a gambling
debt. Lord March, as he then was, went abroad for some years,
detesting the idea of the wife who had been forced upon him.
Returning, and going to the theatre, he was much attracted by a
beautiful girl in a box, and enquired her name. He was informed
that she was “‘the reigning toast, Lady March.’’ He fell in love with
his wife on the spot and they remained devoted for the rest of their
lives. Her father, Lord Cadogan, was a distinguished general under
Marlborough, and a line of military note can thus be traced from
Waller through Cadogan to Napier.

After the third generation from the 2nd Duke and Duchess of
Richmond, the family ability certainly tended to lessen, but reappeared of late years in the persons of Mr. George Wyndham, of the
distingushed scientists the late and present Lords Rayleigh, and of
General Bruce, the leader of the second Mount Everest expedition.
It is certainly a curious fact that Col. Howard-Bury, the leader of the
first expedition, should also belong to the Waller connection ; the
relationship is, of course, far too distant to be of any biological significance, except as illustrating the advantages of descent from good
stock.

In the Villiers and Waller connections we can only trace the
descent of ability in a rather general way, and more eugenic interest
attaches to the origin of the Spencer connection as set out in Chart
8, where the effect of a series of quite remarkably eugenic marriages
can be clearly seen. It will be noted that in six successive generations
of the male line of the Spencer family, marriages took place with
daughters of distinguished fathers. These fathers were as follows :—

(1). Thomas Wriothesley, 8rd Earl of Southampton, Shakespeare’s patron, and active in many other ways.

(2). Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, himself a man of
some note, but chiefly interesting as the nephew of Sir Philip and
father of Algernon.

(3). George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol. A man of great ability
and a remarkable orator, but wanting in consistency of purpose. His
father had been a leading diplomatist.

(4). John Churchill, the great Duke of Marlborough.

(5). John Carteret, Earl Granville, for a time Prime Minister,
descended on his mother’s side from the great Grenville or Granville
family, which emanating from Sir Richard of the **Revenge’’ produced also military commanders of note as well as literary talent,
best exemplified in the fascinating Mrs. Delaney, née Mary Granville.

(6). Stephen Poyntz, a man of less note than the others, but
a diplomatist of some distinction, sprung from a commercial family
and great nephew of Richard Deane, who was second only to Blake
as an admiral under the Commonwealth. Mrs. Poyntz, a great
beauty, was niece of Charles Mordaunt, Earl of Peterborough, the
able but extremely eccentric commander in Spain during the war of
the Spanish Succession.

The male line of the Spencers, with this remarkable heritage,
produced two statesmen of great note in the 2nd and 8rd Earls of
Sunderland, but it is curious that their immediate successors, John
84 ~ EUGENICS REVIEW.

Spencer and the ist Earl Spencer, did little or nothing in themselves,
but quite obvously passed on latent talent, for the descendants of the
Ist harl Spencer can show an. altogether exceptional family record.
Jt must be admitted at once that no absolutely first-rate man was
produced, but individuals of the second rank have been quite exceptionally numerous. In statesmanship three Larls Spencer, the 2nd
Karl Granville, who is said to have spoken French better than any
other Inglishman of his day, the 8th Duke of Devonshire, better
known as Lord Hartington. In scholarship, the 4th Lord Lyttelton,
who was senior classic, and Bishop Gore ; in athietics, in particular
the present Lord Desborough and the late Mr. Alfred Lyttelton, as
well as nearly all the other Lytteltons, perfect examples of “mens
sana in corpore sano,’’ several Ponsonbys and Mr. Spencer Gore,
who won the first lawn tennis championship ever held.

Nor must the women of the connection be. forgotten, the
brilliant Duchess of Devonshire and her equally brilliant granddaughter, the Duchess of Sutherland, the eccentric, but in many
‘ways able, Lady Caroline Lamb, and the aunt and niece, Henrietta,
Countess of Bessborough and Sarah Lady Lyttelton, whose recently
published letters show great literary gifts. |

The Spencer connection demonsirates in the fullest degree the
value of a good stock; the finest flower of English aristocracy, their
remarkable versatility is most clearly due to the very versatile
ancestors from whom they all derive.

It will be observed that the Spencers belonged both to the
Villiers and to the Sidney connections, to the former through the
Duke of Marlborough, to the latter through the Earl of Leicester.
The ability of the Sidney connection persisted in many different
directions, and Chart 4 traces a line from Edmund Dudley to the
present Lord Grey of Falloden, passing through seven distinct
families, which in almost every generation shows one or more men of
historic note. It must be allowed that in the case particularly of the
Pelhams, actual ability is perhaps not very evident, but even these
showed energy, and during a period of over four centuries, this line
at least never became unimportant or commonplace.

Some connections of note in the 15th and 16th centuries have
been selected for Charts 5, 6 and 7.

Chart 5 shows the descent from the Wyatts of the Vanes and the
Twysdens. Of the Wyatts the elder Sir Thomas was the most distinguished, a poet of great gifts, a scholar and a diplomatist, one of
the earliest examples of the notable all-round men of the 16th
century, so many of whom had relatives of distinction. The younger
Su Thomas is known in history for his romantic and ill-fated rising
on behalf of Lady Jane Grey ; Sir Francis, his much _less-known
grandson, was an early and on the whole successful governor of
Virginia. Clearly, however, the ability of the first Sir Thomas
descended most on the Vanes, father and son, though it took a very
different form. The Twysdens were much less notable than the
Vanes, but they were a very versatile family, Sir Roger, an historical
antiquary of note; Sir Thomas, a judge; John, a physician. These
Twysdens were connected on the mother’s side with the Finches,
STUDIES IN HEREDITARY ABILITY. 35

that remarkable legal family referred to by Galton, ‘‘Hereditary
Genius,”’ p. 84.

James Ussher, the learned Archbishop of Armagh, perhaps the
greatest scholar of his time, is the central figure of Chart 6. It will
be seen that both his maternal grandfather, James Staneyhurst,
recorder of Dublin, and his maternal grandson, James Tyrell, a
minor historical writer, achieved some note. This is one of the very
few instances where a maternal grandfather, and again his maternal
grandfather, appears in D.N.B. ; another instance will be found in
the Pratt connection, hereafter referred to.

The descents exemplified by the St. Leger connection, Chart 7,
are of considerable interest, as though the individuals mentioned are
not on the whole celebrated, very varied abilities appeared. Archbishop Warham was a great statesman and prelate, the St. Legers
were chiefly famed in arms, the earlier Digges, Leonard and Thomas,
who had none of the St. Leger blood, were mathematicians. Of the
later Digges who were descended from the St. Legers, Leonard was
@ poet and translator, Sir Dudley a diplomat and judge, the second
Dudley a political writer. Literary talent was beginning to appear
and is to be found again in the last Anthony Hammond and his son
James. The Hammonds had, however, connections of distinetion
also on the paternal side, the scholar Thomas Stanley, and,
more distantly, the poet Richard Lovelace, together with a direct
descent from Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York temp. Elizabeth,
whose sons were notable colonial pioneers. On the whole, therefore,
it is perhaps remarkable that the Hammonds did not achieve more,
and it is to be observed that in the case of all these three connections,
Wyatt, Ussher, St. Leger, ability seems ultimately to have become
extinct, no doubt through discontinuance of eugenic marriages.

So far the lines traced have been those of a common descent, but
it is, of course, equally if not perhaps more interesting, to trace as
far as possible the ancestry of well-known individuals in various
directions.

Chart 8 indicates some of the forebears of the famous Lord
Chesterfield, best known by his letters, but no mean statesman, and
perhaps the most typically polished man of the world of all time.
There were many other notable Stanhopes in the male line, but these
are rather distantly related to the letter writer, who owed his ability
chiefly to the successive eugenic marriages of his great grandfather,
his grandfather and his father. The first named, Henry Lord Stanhope, married the heiress of the Wotton family, herself a lady of
strong character who played no small part in the civil wars. The
Wottons were one of the most distinguished of the all-round families
of Elizabethan times, particularly Sir Nicholas, a really great
diplomatist, and Sir Henry, poet, ambassador and provost of Eton.
The grandfather, the 2nd Far! of Chesterfield, married into the
Dormer family, his wife’s grandfather, the Ist Earl of Carnarvon, was
a very gallant Cavalier, described by Clarendon ‘‘as of a very keen
courage, an excellent discerner and presser of advantage over the
enemy,’” and through this family a double descent can be traced from
the Sidneys, through the Herberts and the Montagus respectively.
36 EKUGENICS REVIEW.

. Even more remarkable, perhaps, was the descent derived by the

great Lord Chesterfield from his mother, a daughter of that George
Savile, Marquis of Halifax, so brilliantly portrayed by Macaulay as
the ‘ Trimmer.’ Chesterfield certainly derived many characteristics
from this grandfather, who forestalled the grandson by writing
‘‘ Letters of Advice to a Daughter,” a work of interest, though not.
comparable to the later ‘Letters.’ Halifax’s wife was a Pierrepont,.
her father was known as ‘ Wise William.’ He was a great grandfather alike of Lord Chesterfield and Lady Mary Montagu,
who were thus second cousins. Halifax himself had_ distinguished descent, his maternal great uncle was the famous
Lord Strafford, of a character singular different to that of
his great nephew, the one a typical extremist, the other a
typical centre party man. On his mother’s side Halfax derived from
the Coventrys, a legal family of note.

It will be seen that Lord Chesterfield’s ancestry was distinguished
im almost every direction, and a careful analysis of the qualities of his
ancestors shews clearly what were the makings of this brilliant man of
the world. It is, however, interesting to note that his illegitimate son,
for whom he cared so much, proved quite worthless and inherited
none of the distinction of his paternal ancestors. In him the presumably indifferent maternal line must have been most unfortunately predominant. Lord Chesterfield’s own father, too, with a great heredity
behind him, did nothing of any note, like the Ist Earl Spencer, his
role was merely that of a transmitter of great qualities.

Lord John Russell furnishes the next example of notable ancestry.
Chart 9.

As in the Spencer, so in the Russell. family, successive marriages
in the male line of eugenic value occurred, though the fathers were on
the whole of much less distinction. The first marriage to be noted,
that of the daughter of the infamous Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset,
and his even more infamous wife, can only have brought in a certain
energy and push, but so far as can be traced no evil moral effect
persisted. William Lord Russell’s admirable wife Rachel, came of
two distinguished stocks, the Wriothesleys and the Ruvignys, while
the marriage of the 2nd Duke of Bedford with the granddaughter of
Sir Josiah Child, the great East Indian magnate, is interesting as
bringing in that commercial strain which helped to strengthen so
many of the English governing families, even in their most aristocratic
days. The 4th Duke’s wife, herself a woman of strong character, was
niece of Lady Mary Montagu. Their son, Lord Tavistock, married
into the Keppels, a family of naval and military note, and
through their mother belonging to the Villiers connection.
Lord John Russell’s own mother was a Byng, great granddaughter of a successful admiral and great niece of another admiral
the unfortunate John Byng, who was far from sharing the success of
his father. Her mother was a Boyle, a family which at an earlier
date played many varied parts. It is interesting that Lord John, an
aristocrat of aristocrats, derived also on the Byng side com nercial
descent, from the rather obscure family of Daniel, who may well
have been of Jewish origin.
STUDIES IN HEREDITARY ABILITY. | “ 37

The later Russells in general have, like the Spencers, shewn much
versatility ; for example, the first Lord Ampthill an eminent
diplomatist and his son a great oarsman, the present Duke of Bedford
well known as a naturalist, Mr. George Russell a charming writer, and
Mr. Bertrand Russell, mathematician and Socialist. poe Be

On the whole the Russell ability has been rather less than the
Spencer, or at least less numerously diffused, just as the descent is on
the whole not so distinguished.

A third example of brilliant heredity is furnished by Lord
Haldane. Se o

Both his grandfathers, John Haldane and Richard Burdon, were
men of some mark. Strength of character seems chiefly to have
distinguished the former, who left the navy to become a Congregational
leader, intellect the latter, who did not, however, follow up a brilliant
scholastic career, but his son, Sir John Burdon-Sanderson, achieved
great note as a scientist. Lord Haldane’s most famous relatives,
however, are various great grand uncles :—Sir Ralph Abercromby,
the general ; Viscount Duncan, the admiral, and the two great lawyers,
Lord Eldon and Lord Stowell. Nor is a commercial descent lacking in
this case also, Sir John Sanderson, Richard Burdon’s father-in-law,
having been a successful banker. In Lord Haldane’s very varied
career, almost all the activities of his relatives may at one time or
another be traced.

He is not, it may be remarked, the only member of the present
Government who clearly derives ability from his ancestors. Lord
Parmoor is great nephew of Sir William Laurence, a very distinguished
surgeon of his day ; Mr. Trevelyan is, as is well known, great nephew
of Lord Macaulay, in addition to his nearer relatives of note; Mr.
Buxton, great grandson of the abolitionist, Sir Fowell Buxton, is also
great grand nephew of Mrs. Elizabeth Fry, and ultimately descended
from Robert Barclay, the Apologist of the Quakers, though this last
descent is, of course, too remote to have any biological significance.
Colonel Wedgwood, descended from the great potter, and a cousin of
the Darwins, is maternal grandson of an eminent engineer, James
Meadowes Rendal. Lord Chelmsford is the son of a general and
grandson of a Lord Chancellor. Mr. Ponsonby belongs to the Spencer
connection. :

There can be little doubt that similar ability existed among the
ancestors of other members of the Government, though it was not
sufficient to raise them to a considerable position in the world from the
humbler walks of life in which they were born.

The last two Charts, 11 and 12, indicate the lines of descent from
which the ability of the late Lord Salisbury and the ability of Lord
Randolph Churchill were in all probability derived.

Nothing shews more clearly the undue emphasis laid on purely
male line descents, owing to the similarity of name, than the often
quoted descent of the Cecils from Lord Burleigh, and of the Churchills
from the first Duke of Marlborough. The descent from Burleigh is
certainly too remote to be of biological import and that from Marlborough has probably little more value in this respect.

The connection indicated in Chart 11 between the Wellesley and
38 EUGENICS REVIEW.

Cecil families is possibly the origin of the ability of both. In her life
of her father, Lady Gwendolin Cecil is decidedly of opinion that his
qualities were derived from his paternal grandmother, the daughter
of Lord Downshire, whose cousin, the Duke of Wellington’s mother,
was also a woman of strong character. Their mutual ancestor, Sir
John Trevor, was an able, though very unscrupulous, Speaker in the
reign of William III, and cousin of the notorious Jeffreys. ‘The later
members of this connection were certainly morally far superior to the
earlier !

In the case of Lord Randolph, his ability can almost certainly be
traced, as in Chart 12, through the Stewarts to the Pratts, including
among his direct ancestors a Chief Justice, a Lord Chancellor, and
in the 8rd Lord Londonderry an eminent diplomatist and general,
while the Hardinges, distinguished in many fields, are doubly related.

While the connections in these charts shew, however, the probable
line of descent of ability, in the one case of Lord Salisbury and the
Balfours, in the other case of Lord Randolph, the present Cecils and
Mr. Winston Churchill owe perhaps as much to the lines of their
mothers. There was much brilliance among Lady Salisbury’s family,
the Aldersons, while Lady Randolph’s father was a very acute
American business man. Here again we see the mixed aristocratic
and commercial descent, of such undoubted eugenic value, and it may
be remarked that in another line both Cecils and Balfours possess such
a descent, the late Lord Salisbury’s mother springing from a strictly
commercial family, the Gascoignes, one member of whom was Lord
Mayor of London.

It will be noted that these studies have been entirely confined to
aristocratic families and connections, but it is in these alone that it is
possible to trace many different lines of ascent and descent, or, at any
rate, to discover anything of the characteristics of the individuals in
these lines. The best descents are, however, never entirely aristocratic,
the ‘ mixed ’ marriages have in fact been of enormous eugenic value
in this country. |

A few very great names have been mentioned, but only a few,
and the descent of actual genius, though not quite incalculable, is
certainly very difficult to trace.

But in the case of great ability, as compared with genius, the
effects of sound heredity are much more obvious, particularly perhaps
in the power of leadership and in the power of charm.
