THE SIGNIFICANCE OF
RECENT BIRTH-RATE FIGURES

By RICHARD M. TITMUSS

HIS article has a strictly limited
purpose. It is to recall some simple,
though essential, features of the dyna
mics of population in their bearing on recent
birth-rate figurés in England. These figures
have shown an upward trend which by many
has been welcomed, and by a few Malthusian
die-hards deplored, as evidence of a turn in
our reproductive tide so definite and unmistakable as to falsify the predictions that
had been made of a progressive diminution
in the numbers of our population. It will be
shown that the published figures, viewed in
proper perspective (i.e. against a background

of the demographic trend of the past thirty .

years), offer no reason for assuming that our
population problems are, in any fundamental
sense, nearer solution than they were only a
couple of years ago, when our birth rate
touched the lowest figure ever recorded in the
history of vital statistics.

Some basic data

During the year or two immediately preceding the war of 1914-18 the rate of live
births per 1,000 population was in the order
of 24.* By the end of the war it had fallen to
17°7, at that time the lowest annual figure
ever recorded—the year 1918 having also
been distinguished by the all-time lowest
rate for any first’ quarter, namely 17-5. In
1918 the total number of women in the reproductive age groups, I5 to 49 years,
amounted approximately to 10,500,000, of
whom some 4,800,000 belonged to the highly
reproductive group of 20 to 34 years. It is
significant that these women, in the sternest
period of the war, produced between them
some 663,000 live births.

These figures should be contrasted with
those prevailing to-day. In 1941 the birth

rate touched bottom at 14-2; it rose to 15-8
in 1942, and still further to 16:8 in the first
quarter of 1943. At mid-1939 the number of
women in the age groups I5 to 49 was
11,464,000, and in the group 20 to 34 it was
5,032,000—i.e. distinctly greater than the
corresponding figures for 1918 and, it may be
computed, not materially different from the
figures of 1942-3. Yet in 1942, despite this
advantage of nearly a million more potential
mothers, there were fewer births—i.e. a total
of 654,000—than in the worst year of the
last war.

The illusion of short-term oscillations

After the last war the birth rate rose
sharply from the hitherto record low level of
17°7 in 1918 to 25:5 in 1920. In that year:
958,000 infants were born to approximately
the same number of women as in 1918. From
this peak, however, the rate subsided rapidly,
falling back to 17-8 by 1926 and then declining less steeply to 14:4 (the lowest betweenwars figure) in 1933. Nevertheless, there were
many in 1920 who believed that the rise
to the highest birth-rate figure registered for
ten years heralded a permanent change in our
reproductive trend. Similar conclusions—
though with far less excuse, since we now
have past experience for a warning—have
been, and are being, drawn from the 1942
figures, which were again the highest for ten
years. 
The influence of changing marriage rates

In this war, as in the last, marriage rates
have fluctuated violently. When the numbers
of new marriages contracted rise or fall we
must expect parallel movements in the birth
rate. These changes, up or down, in the
annual numbers of births may be brought
about mainly by an unusually high or low
proportion of first births to young couples,
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF RECENT BIRTH-RATE FIGURES

In 1915 the rate of new marriages per I,000
total population, after fluctuating around
14-17 during the preceding seventy-five years,
suddenly rose to a record rate of I9°4; and
then again in 1920, after a slump to 13-8 in
Ig17, a new record was established in the
rate of 20-2. From 1922 to 1932 the rate
varied between 14:3 and 15-8; but in 1933
it began to rise, climbing slowly to 17-6 in
1938, 21-2 in 1939, and then in 1940 to the
highest point ever reached—namely 22:7.
The inevitable recession occurred in 1941,
when the rate fell to 18-7, and still further to
17-8 in 1942. This decline continues, and with
statistically unimportant fluctuations must
continue, as our marriageable stocks dwindle.

Factors favouring reproduction

By 1942 we had a situation in which many
short-term factors were operating together in
favour of a higher birth rate. In the first
place the number of married women under 40
had risen by about 20 per cent since 1931, and
in 1939-42 there had been a record number of
new marriages. Actually there were 225,000
more marriages during 1939-42 than there
would have been if the moderately high
marriage rates of 1936-8 (approximately
17°5) had persisted ; and if only half these
additional marriages had produced one child
there would thus have been 112,500 additional births during the war years. Yet over
the period 1939-42 there were, in fact, only
19,000 more births than there would have
been had the birth-rate average of 1936-8
been operating. |

To put the matter in another way. During
the past ten years there have been approximately half a million additional early
marriages, mostly between young people, the
mean age of spinsters at marriage having decreased considerably during that decade.
Yet this enormous additional number of
years of married life within the fertile age
groups, though it has depleted our marriageable stocks possibly to a record low level, has
had but a trifling effect on the crude birth
rate. This is all the more noteworthy when
we recall how the smaller increment of new
marriages after the last war produced such a
far greater number of births.

Among other favourable factors now
operating we must reckon full and regular
employment, rising wage levels,* and the
payment of allowances for several million
children. The conscription of women for
industry and the forces must also have led
many women to decide, as one Member put it
in the recent House of Commons debate, that
they could best serve their country as
mothers; and we must add as other factors
the high concentration of the Armed Forces
in this country as compared with 1917-18,
the presence of very large numbers of young
men from the Dominions and elsewhere, and
the measures taken by the Government to
safeguard the health of expectant and
nursing mothers and of young children.
Furthermore, the number of female births
registered in I920-2I was 210,000 greater
than in 1918-19, and the vast majority of
these had reached marriageable age by the
outbreak of the present war.

Some general conclusions

Thus, an extraordinary series of favourable
elements, all operating within the last few
years, have been brought to bear on our
reproductive trend. Between them they
might have been expected to lead toa marked
rise in the number of births ; but within our
present population structure this rise does not
necessarily denote one in the net reproduction rate. Indeed, on a critical examination
of recent demographic history it becomes
evident that we are still advancing on the
last wave of a tide of high fertility. The
consequences of the low reproduction rates

* In this connection we may quote a recent American
investigation into the relation of business cycles,
marriage rates and birth rates during 1919-37 (Galbraith, V. L., and Thomas, D. S., Journal Amer. Stat.
Ass., 1941, 36). The authors’ conclusion was: ‘ This
suggests that the direct restriction of first births.
during depressions is somewhat less than that of
immediately higher orders, a finding that is compatible with the spread of the small family system.
The conclusion seems inescapable that, during the past
two decades, the preventive check has been extensively
in operation. Marriages are ‘ controlled ’ during depressions, and, within marriages, births of all orders are
likewise controlled. Since birth rates of higher orders
are overweighted with births to the lower income,
occupational, and educational classes, it is clear that
the birth control movement has penetrated deep into
the social structure during the past two decades.”
from the mid-1920’s have yet to come. At
the moment economic conditions are favouring a high level of young marriages ; delayed
marriages and delayed births from the years
of the great depression are also contributing
their share ; and we have been “‘ borrowing ”’
marriages and probably births from the
future. It is, as Kuczynski remarks, ‘‘ absurd
to assume that those who now marry at 24
would adopt the views and habits of another
social group only as a consequence of marrying earlier.”’* In other words, earlier marriage
and the earlier birth of one child does not
mean that families will be larger.

Perhaps, however, ‘‘ borrowing ”’ is not the
right word, for we may not intend to pay
back. Thus, in a period of unprecedented
economic prosperity we have, while temporarily enjoying an abnormally large age
group 20-40, been recouping from the past
and “‘ stealing,’ shall we say, from the future.
To this favourable situation we have added
an entirely novel incentive for women, to have
at least one pregnancy. Future students of
demographic history may well ask why, in
this favourable situation, with the danger of
national defeat removed, the cessation of
massed air attacks, and the promise of a new

and better world within realization, the rise’
in the birth rate has not been higher than
recorded to date. It is indeed more than
probable that the rise will continue for some
time, perhaps reaching 20 per 1,000. But let
us remember the oscillations in the past and
bear in mind that what is happening to-day
in Britain is also happening in other parts of
the world. In the U.S.A., in most parts of
the Dominions, and even in Denmark,
Holland, Sweden, Switzerland and Czechoslovakia the crude birth rate rose in I9g4I
and again in 1942. Whereas the rise in 1942
for England and Wales (over the average
for 1936-8) was 6 per cent, the corresponding
increases in Sweden, Switzerland and Denmark amounted to 23 per cent, 21 per
cent and 14 per cent respectively.

This turn in the birth-rate trend has been
unexpected because of the known effects of
previous wars on fertility. In 1939 it seemed:
as though the war would cause the birth rate
for England and Wales to decline to an
abnormally low level. Up to the end of 1941
these fears were at least partially justified.
Now the upswing has come. Does it herald a
permanent change? Should we not rather
say, after taking account of the remarkable
combination of favourable influences, that the
tide of reproduction, which has been receding
for over sixty years, has not yet turned ?
