THE SEX RATIO AT BIRTH.
By S. DE JASTRZEBSKI.

IN adding yet another to the innumerable contributions that have been
made to the study of the inequality of the sex ratio at birth, my object is
a simple and humble one, yet one of paramount importance. It is to
provide, as far as I am able, data sufficiently complete and far-reaching
as to justify some definite conclusions on this much debated question.
In my own fragmentary reading om the subject I have been impressed by
the light-hearted way in which most of those who have dealt with it have
based their theories on, and drawn their conclusions from, material so
slight as to afford no reasonable ground for any definite deduction.
Moreover, much of this inadequate material is open to grave suspicion as
to its reliability, much of it is out of date, and much of it is not available
for investigation amd check.

And, with all respect for the undoubted ability of many of the
distinguished men who have written on this subject, I am surprised that
in so many cases the evident desire to bolster up some preconceived idea
has warped their critical faculty and obscured their perception. For my
own part, I have no theories to advamce, no past explanations to justify,
no special school of statisticians to uphold or attack. Im the main I look
upon what I have read on the subject rather in the light of “a horrid
warning and true-hearted example” of what to avoid, than of a lamp of
knowledge by which to guide my way. Practically the whole of the
figures which I give have been collected by myself during the last few
years, and have been taken from the official statistical publications of
the countries named, and in most cases the number of births is given so
that the extent of the data can be seen. The range of my inquiry is a
very restricted one, for I have confined it almost entirely to matters
comceming which the mass of material available was sufficient to warramt
some: definite conclusion from the facts presented.

In the first place it may be granted that, so far as we know, there
is a preponderance of males born throughout the human race. This
preponderance of males at birth is, however, not equally spread; there
is a fairly considerable variation in its amount, a variation apparently
due not to one but to a variety of causes. The first object, therefore, in
collecting data on which to determine these causes is to present them in
such a way as to neutralise as far as possible the effect of causes other
than the one under consideration. This may be done in two ways, by
widening as far as possible the area from which our data is assembled,
and by presenting it with the other conditions which may affect the
results, as far as possible equal.

Most writers agree that race is a factor and an important one in its
effect om masculimity at birth. Yet in the main they have based their
conclusions on figures relating to political divisions rather tham on racial
8 EUGENICS REVIEW.

ones. I am well aware that such a thing as a pure race is sadly to seek,
and that the ordinarily accepted racial terms applied to European nations
are quite misleading. We are for the most part quite content to describe
the French, for example, as being a Latin race, although as a matter of
fact they are probably the most composite of all the nations of the world.
But there are certain racial distinctions still fairly well preserved by
some of the peoples of the world, even in Europe, and of the countries
for which statistics are available that congeries of races which maide up
the Empire of Austria, now falling into its separate parts, presents the
best field for our inquiry. For be it noted we have here im some or other
of the provinces of the empire populations of which a great majority
belongs to some people with more or less clearly differentiated racial
characteristics. The latest figures at my command are those relating to
the three years 1904, 1907 and 1910, and from them I have extracted the
particulars for the several provinces of (1) Dalmatia with a preponderating Serbo-Croat population, (2) Upper and Lower Austria, mainly
Germans, (3) Bohemia and Moravia, mainly Czechs, or as they are now
styled, Czecho-Slovako, (4) Galicia, predominantly Polish, and (5) the
“ Kiistenlande,” predominantly Italian. In addition, I give the figures
for the Jews throughout the Empire.

This table then deals with a variety of racial, rather than national,
divisions, all within the same political boundary, living under conditions
which are strictly comparable, and these show a well-marked variation
in the degree of masculinity.

As to the relative masculinity of the white and black races the
material available is not very extensive, but it all points to a lower male
ratio at birth among the blacks. In the Cape Colony (including
Bechuanaland and Pondoland), during the years 1904-8 inclusive, the
ratio of males in 100,000 white births recorded was 1,054, while in. 100,000
births of natives it was only 1,026. In those areas of the United States
in which registration of births obtains, for which the first set of statistics
(for the year 1915) has recently appeared, the ratio of male to female
births among whites (700,000 births) was 1,057, while among the negroes
(12,000 births) it just failed to reach 1,000. In New York City for the
quinquennium 1907-11 the respective ratios of masculinity were, whites
THE SEX RATIO AT BIRTH. 9

(700,000 births) 1,045, negroes (10,000 births) 1,016; in New Orleans for
the years 1914-15 they were, whites (12,000 births) 1,020, negroes (4,000
births) 982; amd in the District of Columbia for the four years 1913-16,
whites (20,000 births) 1,050, negroes (9,000 births) 1,000. It will be seen
from these figures that in every case for which I have been able te obtain
comparative statistics the masculinity is lower among negroes than
among whites inhabiting the same areas. Further, in the West Indies,
where the coloured population is in an overwhelming preponderance,
masculinity is decidedly lower than in any European country. Thus in
the Island of St. Vincemt for the decade 1905-14 it was 1,021, while in
Trinidad for the quinquennium ig11-15, excluding the East Indian
element, it only reached gor.

Again, in Ceylon, where three main racial divisions are recognised—
the Sinhalese, the Tamils and the Moors—the ratio of maile to female
births in 1914 was 1,037 for the two former and 1,063 for the last-named.
In the Japanese Empire there is the small and curiously distinct race of
the Ainos of Hokkaido, among whom during the decade 1904-13 masculinity at birth was only 1,004 as compared with 1,046 among the Japanese.

Finally, let us turn to our Indian Empire presenting as it does the
most bewildering variety of racial types in its enormous population.
There is of course an equally bewildering variety of opinion as to how
these types should be classified, but for our purpose this is immaterial.
All that is essential from our point of view is that it is universally
recognised that these racial differences exist, their classification does not’
affect our argument. Accepting on these grounds Riseley’s division of the
races inhabiting India, viz.: Dravidian, Mongolo-Dravidian, ScythioDravidian, Aryo-Dravidian, Mongoloid, Indo-Aryan, and Turco-Iranian,
1 have in Table II. dealt with the births registered im the three years
IgI2-13-14 in certain provinces in which one or other of these types is
largely represented.

10 ‘ EUGENICS REVIEW.

Here again it will be seen that the same result is shown as in Table
I., with a much wider range of differentiation. From the figures given,
which deal with very large numbers of births in widely-separated parts of
the world, but so grouped as to make them truly comparable, we may
surely accept as proven the conclusion that race is an important factor
in determining the relative degree of masculinity at birth.

In their very interesting and unbiassed paper on “ The variations in
masculinity under different conditions ” read by Messrs. J. N. amd C. J.
Lewis to the Institute of Actuaries on January 29th, 1906, the authors
went further and arrived at the conclusion that cross-breeding raises
masculinity. The evidence on which this conclusion was based related
to the city of Buenos Aires for the decade 1884-1893. The numbers of
births are not given, but obviously they camnot be very large. The
evidence on this point which I have been able to collect is not very
extensive, but it is very considerably greater than that at the command
of Messrs. Lewis, and is shown im Table III.

The results are curiously contradictory. In each area there is
greater or lesser variation in the masculinity of the children born to
native, foreign and mixed parents and-in each the masculinity of the
children born to foreign parents is higher than that to native. But with
those of mixed parentage it will be seen that in the first area (United
States, 1915) the masculinity is considerably lower tham that of either the
foreign or native, in the second (New York City, 1907-11) it is considerably higher, while in Uruguay (1912-13-15-16-17) it is higher than the
native but considerably lower than the foreign.

For the city of Rio de Jameiro I have the figures of the births of
whites, mulattoes and negroes for the six years 1910-15. These relate to
109,000 births, of which 90,000 were those of whites, 15,000 of mulattoes,
THE SEX RATIO AT BIRTH. II

and 4,000 of negroes. The respective ratios of males ta females were,
white 1,049, mulattoes 979, negroes 999. Here the cross between black
and white races has resulted in a decided lowering of the ratio of
masculinity of both the original stocks, as is also the case in British
Guiana (see Table III.). For the present, therefore, the question: must
be relegated to the large number of those for which the restricted nature
of material renders any definite conclusion umsafe. If I may hazard a
personal opinion it is that the effect of cross-breeding on the masculinity
of the offspring probably depends on the nature of the cross, and that it
may be either positive, negative or neutral.

On the question of the variation in masculinity at birth as affected by
legitimacy or illegitimacy there is a mass of material now available, and
in Tables IV. and V. I have collected recent statistics dealing with many
millions of births.

It will be seen that while in the mass masculinity is higher im the
children born in wedlock, this is not universally the case. Among the
European countries shown in the table the illegitimates have a higher
masculinity in Norway, Sweden, Scotland and Spain, and the same
phenomenon is shown in the figures for Uruguay, while in England and
Wales, Austria and Denmark the ratios are very nearly equal. But to
be of any real value it is mecessary to know not the numbers born in or
out of legal wedlock, but what births are the results of casual union. In
the figures given a varying but probably considerable proportion of the
births classed as those of illegitimates are the results of umions which,
although not recognised by the law or the Church, are from the physiological point of view marriages. This consideration must materially
discount any conclusions which might be drawn from the figures presented. To determine what bearing, if any, promiscuious as compared
with permanent unions exercise on masculinity requires knowledge which
we do not possess.

On the question of masculinity in urban as compared with rural
areas Messrs. Lewis in the paper already cited gave figures for a number
of European countries (Scotland, Germany, France, Belgium, Sweden
and Norway), which show in every case a higher ratio of masculinity in
the births occurring in the rural areas. In Table VI. I have extended
the area of investigation by citing some European countries not given by
them and what is of considerably greater interest, including some figures
for America and Africa.

In every case there is a higher ratio for the rural than the urban
areas, and the evidence on this point 1s sufficient to warrant the definite
conclusion that urbanisation lowers masculinity. On the question of
primogeniture I have little to add to what has already been written. The
only new figures given by the brothers Lewis are those relating to Scotland for the year 1855, the first year in which civil registration obtained
in that country, and these must be taken with some reserve. Bertilliom’s
oft-quoted figures for Austria appear to me quite grotesque, while Stieda’s
for Alsace-Lorraine give a lower masculinity for the first than for later
births. The only recent and reliable contribution to our knowledge on
this point is that given by Knibbs for the Australian Commonwealth,
viz. : 1,052 for the first and 1,050 for subsequent births. The only new
figures I have been able to compile personally relate to the city of
Budapest for the four years 1905-8. These relate to only 60,000 births
and the respective ratios are 1,051 for first and 1,049 for subsequent
births. This result it will be seen is in striking conformity with that
obtained by Knibbs. The material for a comprehensive investigation on
this point is, however, not yet available, and all that I am prepared to
assert is that the evidence points to masculinity being slightly higher
among the first born. It is mearly a century ago that Hofacker pro
pounded his theory that the sex proportion at birth was materially, if
not mainly, affected by the relative ages of the parents, masculinity being
greater where the father is older than the mother and less when the
reverse is the case. The history of this theory is interesting and instructive. Hofacker founded it on observations confined to. 1996 births. In
the following year (1830) Sadler investigated 2,068 births in this country,
found confirmatory results and on this exiguous basis the so-called
“ Hofacker-Sadler law” held the field for many years. It received its
first serious attack from Stieda, who, investigating over 100,000 births in
14 . EUGENICS REVIEW.

the seventies, obtained results absolutely opposed to those of Hofacker
and Sadler. But the law died hard and has, I believe, its adherents
still. Messrs. Lewis give a fairly comprehensive list of the various
supporters and opponents of the law. Those whose investigations are
favourable include Hofacker, Sadler, Goehlert, Legoyt, Boulenger,
Oehrn, Boeckh and Lewis, and the births brought under review numbered
325,448. On the other side were Noirot, Breslau, Stieda, Berner and
Schumann, who brought 579,384 births under review. Thus the weight
of evidence was decidedly against. But in no single case had any one
of these investigators a sufficient mass of material to warrant any decisive
conclusion. The Austrian records for the three years 1904, 1907 and
1910, so frequently referred to in this paper, gave me the opportunity of
investigating the point on a really large scale, as the data as to relative
ages of the parents are available in no fewer than 1,436,762 births. The
results show that where the father was older than the mother the ratio of
male to female births was 1,055, where the reverse was the case 1,057.
Thus at the first test on a fully adequate scale the Hofacker-Sadler law
is conclusively shown to be no law.

The theory, however, which probably excites most interest at the
present moment is that as to whether war has any effect on the male
ratio at birth. A number of eminent statistical authorities have maintained that during wars the male ratio is sensibly increased, among them
Ploss, Diising, Oettingen, Geddes, Mayr, Revelli and Rauber. None of
these, however, has very convincing data to go on, Diising’s figures
relating to the war between Sweden and Russia (1789-90) are confined to
Sweden and are the best of the lot. On the other hand, Lexis and
Carlberg failed to find any influence of war, and von Fircks maintains
that the male ratio is actually lowered. Gini, in his exhaustive work,
“Tl sesso dal punto di vista statistico,” summarises his conclusions thus:
“In conclusion, any relation between war and the sex ratio at birth
appears to us more than doubtful. The coincidences observed by Diising,
and by Oettingen, as well as those met with by ourselves in Serbia, may
be calmly regarded as accidental” (p. 240). And on page 248 he goes
even further and writes: “L’ anormalita del rapporto dei sessi durante e
dopo le guerre @ categoricamente smentita.” In a recent paper read
before the Royal Statistical Society, Nixon, investigating the effects of
the Austro-Prussian war of 1866, and the Franco-German war of 1870,
arrived at the same conclusion. The data on which both the supporters
and opponents of Diising’s theory worked were in every case ludicrously
inadequate. The present war will, when all the figures become available,
first put this theory to the decisive test. Meantime, Sir Bernard Mallet,
in his presidential address to the Royal Statistical Society last year, has
drawn attention to the remarkable figures relating to war births in the
United Kingdom. These figures I am now able to carry on to a later
date and to supplement by some relating to our overseas dominions, to
Hungary, Finland, and to some of the neutral countries in immediate
contiguity to the area of military operations. These are set out in

From this table it will be seen that in seven of the belligerent
countries, with over 34 millions of births under review, there has been
in every case a rise in masculinity more or less marked, and that in
those for which the figures cover more than one year of war births, ?.¢.,
of conceptions since the outbreak of war, the rise in masculinity is pronounced. And this rise is reflected in the Netherlands, Switzerland and
Denmark, the three neutral countries nearest to the actual zone of
military operations. To say the least, the results are remarkable for their
unanimity, and warrant the conclusion that so far as the British Empire
is concerned, the effect’of war has been to increase masculinity at birth
to an appreciable extent. The volume of evidence is greatly in excess
of that on which most of the theories as to what does or does not affect
the ratio of masculinity at birth have hitherto been based, and, moreover,
it is all on one side. But, before asserting that the application is universal, it will be well to await the fuller figures which may be available
at the end of the war.

I have no theory to account for this increase of masculinity in wartime, but there is no lack of them from other sources. One widely held
is that war itself is not a cause, but the hardships and privations which
war entails on the belligerent peoples. As far as the British populations
are concerned this may be ruled out of court at once. Major Darwin
and Sir Shirley Murphy favour the idea that, as masculinity is higher
among the first born and as war births include an unusually large proportion of first births, this may be the determining cause. Granting that
the higher masculinity of the first born is proven, this would, on what
16

EUGENICS REVIEW.

Knibbs has established for Australia and I for Budapest, account for but
a small fraction of the recorded increase. Normally, about 25 per cent.
of births are those of first born children, and even if we allow double
that proportion the ratio would not be raised by one. Yet in England
there is a rise of six, in Scotland of eight, in Ireland of nine, in Australia
of six, in New Zealand of eleven.

Briefly summarised, the conclusions which may in my own opinion be
drawn from the statistics set forth in this paper are :—

I.
2.

3.

Masculinity at birth is affected by race.

The effects of cross-breeding are doubtful.

Masculinity is generally higher in legitimate than in illegitimate
births, but the present classification of births as legitimate and
illegitimate is useless from the physiological point of view.

Masculinity is greater in rural than in urban populations,

Masculinity is probably slightly greater in first than in subsequent
births, but more evidence is needed on this point.

The Hofacker-Sadler.law is relegated to the limbo of the exploded
theories.

. So far a's the present evidence goes war raises the ratio of

masculinity.
