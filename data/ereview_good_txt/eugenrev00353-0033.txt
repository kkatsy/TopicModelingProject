THE SEX RATIO AND EMIGRATION.

By C. S. Stock, B.A.

In the article on “Emigration” in the April number of the REVIEW a
brief reference was made to the excess of male population overseas and
of female population here; but the matter deserves more attention and
the details are given in the Blue Books of the Dominions Royal ComMission. A Statistical Sub-committee found that in 1911 at all ages the
excess of females in England and Wales was 1,179,000. Analysing this
into particular age-groups, the excess of unmarried females over unmarried males between 15 and 35 was 7,100, and between 15 and 45 was
56,900. These are crude figures and require several corrections, but they
are quoted as an illustration of the fact that the surplus is mainly in the
older age-groups. From a eugenic point of view the fertile age-groups
alone count, and taking 35 as an upper limit the corrected figures are as
follows :—The number of unmarried persons between 15 and 35 in 1911
in England and Wales who will be alive and unmarried on attaining the
35-45 group is—
Women Men
1,187,000 985,000

This gives an unmarried female excess of about 200,000, but as
Ireland, owing to excessive emigration of women, acts in the opposite
direction to Great Britain the figure for the whole United Kingdom is
143,000. That this is far too small a number to help much in solving
the overseas population problem can be seen from the following table of
sex distribution within the Empire :—

The excess of women in the United Kingdom at all ages adds up to
about 1,300,000; the excess of men in the rest of the Empire at all ages
adds up to about 770,000. The excess of males in the Dominions in 1911
was about 6 per cent. of total population, and the excess of female
population in the United Kingdom was about 3 per cent. Both female
surplus here and male surplus overseas are mainly among the middle-aged
and old. Under war conditions our surplus is increasing but that overseas
is decreasing. Male age, however, is eugenically less important than

female. 10,000 women emigrated at 15-19 will contribute twice as much
to the next generation (much more ultimately) as an equal number
emigrated at 25-29, and five times as much as 10,000 emigrated at 30-34,
while at the same time they will give to the community the same number
of years’ service while unmarried as the 25-29 group. A woman under 20
Stands twice as great a chance of marrying within a year in Australia as
one of the same age in England and Wales, and the chance is higher in
other age-groups.

In what section of the community is the bulk of the female surplus
to be found? With few exceptions the proportion of unoccupied women
is generally far lower in working class areas than in middle and upper
class ones. The exceptions are Glamorganshire, Durham, and towns on
the N.E. coast, probably due to absence of opportunity for employment
of women, and in the case of mining districts to the greater chance of
Marriage. The determining factor in the social distribution of unoccupied
women in England and Wales is the opportunity for getting non-domestic
employment. Next to upper class areas the proportion of unmarried
women is highest in the textile districts of Lancashire and the West
Riding of Yorkshire, and the [ow fertility rate here competes with that
of the upper and middle class, but unlike other low fertility groups
textiles show a high infant mortality. “It does not appear,” say the
Commissioners, “that there is in England and Wales any appreciable
surplus of women who are both of the type desired by the Dominions and
can at the same time be readily spared by ourselves, since it is only in
the localities of higher social status—the better parts of London and the
suburbs and the seaside and health resorts—that the surplus exists.” The
small surplus of unmarried women domestic servants can hardly be
spared. |

The lack of women in the sparsely-settled portions of Greater Britain
is mainly due to circumstances common to the whole Empire. Although
in the United Kingdom as a whole there is an excess of females, and
in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa, as a whole, an
excess of males, yet all over the Empire the proportion of women in the
towns is much higher than in rural areas. In Australia the proportion
of women in the chief towns is much the same as in England. Between
25 and 45 the number of women unmarried in Metropolitan Australia is
higher even than in London. Ig the rest of the Continent the proportion
of unmarried women of marriageable age is very low, as also in Canada
and South Africa. Considering in each case 1,000 males, the number of
females is as follows :— :

In the United Kingdom young women migrate to the towns as
domestic servants. In the Dominions many married women live in the
towns and their husbands work in the country.

Uneven distribution between town and country is at the root of the
problem and this distribution is not likely to be affected materially or
permanently by conditions arising out of the War. The following figures
suggest the need of young female emigrants who must of course be
prepared to settle outside the towns and be able to satisfy the requirements
there.

A marked change in the destination of emigrants has taken place.
From 1891-1900 28 per cent. went to British Dominions and the rest to
foreign countries, mainly United States of America. From 1901-12 63 per
cent. went to places within the Empire, and 1913 gave a higher percentage.

The Government has certain powers in regard to emigration, but
these do not enable any effective control of it.

1. The Colonial Office supervises the Emigrants’ Information Office,
which, however, has no executive authority. .

2. The Board of Trade has charge of emigrant ships and some ineffective supervision of passage brokers and their agents. It is not in touch
with movements of emigration inland.

3. The Local Government Board is responsible for the emigration of
Poor Law children and the President acts as spokesman in the House on
emigration.

4. The Home Office is responsible for the emigration of children
from industrial schools.

But the vast bulk is handled by independent societies, which often
overlap, and by the uncontrolled and often unscrupulous activities of
transport companies’ agents. .

The Commissioners recommend that certificates of elementary
teachers in the self-governing Dominions should be recognised in the
United Kingdom and wice versa in order to promote by exchanges closer
mutual understanding. The same arguments apply to secondary and
other schools. .

The Emigration Bill is still sub judice. The most widely-read portion
of the Press has been hostile. Anyone unfamiliar with its mental atmo166 | EUGENICS REVIEW.

sphere would have supposed it impossible to suggest that the reward of
the fighting man was to take the form of banishment from his country,
in face of the obvious fact that the working of such reconstruction
schemes must depend upon the willing co-operation of those for whom
they are intended.

If European figures are any guide very high birth-rates involve very
high death-rates and point to bad conditions of life, ¢.g., Russia—birthrate about 44; death-rate, 29; difference, 15. New Zealand—birth-rate
about 26; death-rate, 9; difference, 17. We can hardly doubt that the
larger figure (17) in New Zealand is far less expensive physically and
morally, and in every way more desirable, than the smaller (15) of
Russia. Perhaps all civilised communities will eventually be drawn
towards the choice which France seems already to have made for herself,
namely, an equilibrium between births and deaths as providing those
conditions under which individuals and communities can live together so
as to make life best worth living. But we must never forget that the
existence of our Dominions beyond the seas falsifies any reasoning about
population which limits itself to these islands alone, and the example of
France is not one that we, with our flag flying over so much fertile
unsettled land, can afford to follow for some time.
