INTELLIGENCE AND

FAMILY SIZE 1949-56

By JOHN D. NISBET, M.A., B.Ed., Ph.D.

F recent years concern over the danger
of declining national intelligence has

lessened. No longer do we share the
fears ‘of a certain pre-war investigator that
the nation is galloping towards intellectual
bankruptcy. The reason is to be found partly
in the results of the Scottish 1947 Mental
Survey, and partly in a swing of psychological
-opinion about the role of heredity in
determining intelligence test score.
In a previous investigation,* it was concluded that
part of (though not all) the negative correlation
of family size and intelligence test score may be
attributed to an environmental influence of the
size of family on verbal development, and
through it on general mental development. At
the same time, in each stage of the investigation
it seemed clear that the whole of the negative
correlation could not be explained in terms of
this environmental influence.

If this is so, then although the danger of a
decline in national intelligence is not so
immediate as once was feared, the possibility
of a slow decline still remains. It may
therefore be of interest, in the interval before
any further large-scale investigation of this
matter, to report a recent check on the
continuing existence of this negative correlation in a small but fairly representative
eleven-year-old sample, where comparable
earlier data are available.t

Much further information would be
necessary to interpret these results fully. In
particular, it would be of interest to know
the mean ages of the parents of the three
groups studied, and to see if the social class

distribution of parents at each family size
differed in the separate years. The interval
between the tests is, however, too short, and
the differences between the results for the
three years too slight to justify such extra
inquiry at this stage, which should be
regarded only as an interim check on trends.

The previous investigation mentioned
above included calculation of mean scores in
two intelligence tests for each size of family
in the groups of school pupils who were
transferred from primary to secondary
schools in Aberdeen in 1949 and 1950. These
transfer groups are not strictly eleven-yearold age-groups, but a large proportion of the
pupils fall within the age-group, and the
transfer groups are roughly comparable from
year to year. In November 1956, when a
similar transfer group was tested, their
scores in two intelligence tests were again
compared with the size of the family to which
each pupil belonged. The 1949 and 1950
groups consist of children born in the
immediate pre-war years, while those in the
1956 group were born just at the end of the
war: the groups may therefore represent a
wider contrast than the relatively short
interval suggests.

In each year, over 2,000 children were
tested with two verbal intelligence tests.
The numbers and tests used were: in 1949,
2,561 tested on Moray House Tests 39 and
40; in 1950, 2,607 tested on MHT 41 and
42; in 1956, 2,248 tested on MHT 53 and 54.
These Moray House Tests are timed tests
with verbal problems of various kinds. Each
year, there was an interval of one week
between the application of the two tests. In
the results below, the score from the first
test applied is given as IQ,, and the score
from the second as IQ,.

Because of the way in which tests are
standardized, it is not possible to use the

results for evidence on the trend of national
intelligence. Each test is standardized separately, and any differences in average score
which may be found between different
year-groups may only reflect differences in
the groups on which the original standardizations were based. However, if the tests
are restandardized on the Aberdeen groups
to give a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 for each test in each group, it is
possible to compare the means at each size
of family to see whether differential fertility
in the latest group shows any marked
differences from that in the earlier groups.

Table I presents in percentage form the
distribution of family size in the three groups
which were studied.

_ The results suggest a small increase in the
proportion of families of two and three at the
expense of families of six or more. The
difference between the distributions in 1950
and 1956 is significant on a Chi-Square test
(X= 47-6, P less than -o1). This trend is
reflected in a decrease in the mean family
size in the complete groups: the mean
family size in 1949 was 3°41; in 1950, 3°38;
in 1956, 3°05.

The results in Table 2 show little difference
between the years, the decrease in mean
score with increasing size of family being
still clearly evident in 1956. The superiority
of only children seems to have lessened
slightly, and the mean score of children from
families of three has dropped below the
general mean. These differences, however,
are slight, and cannot be assumed to represent a consistent trend. It has been customary to express the relation between test
score and family size as a correlation coefficient, though there are certain statistical
objections to doing so. Such coefficients are
presented in Table 3. The differences
between the coefficients in Table 3 are,
however, not significant.
