ENIC PROGNOSIS WITH RESPECT TO
MENTAL DEFICIENCY’

By L. S. PENROSE, ™_.

The most usual form of the eugenic
prognosis problem presented to a medical
adviser is when parents, both of normal
intelligence, have one child who is an
imbecile or idiot. The parents ask what risk
there is of their having another defective
child and the answer can be given in terms of
probability based on known sibships. In
the instances where both parents were of
normal ability—a few had superior mental
capacity—and where the child by which the
selection was made was an idiot or imbecile,
the figures, which are given in Table I and
which form part of Table III, were obtained.

There were 486 sibships of this kind and
1,888 sibs of known mental capacity of whom
2°7 per cent., or one in thirty-seven, were of
imbecile or idiot grade. The incidence of
imbeciles and idiots in the general population
was estimated by Lewis® to be about 0-20
per cent., or one in five hundred. The birth
of an imbecile or idiot to normal parents,
therefore, increases the expectation that a
subsequent child will suffer from low grade
defect by more than ten times.

The expectation can be more accurately
determined if certain other facts are known.
The prognosis is slightly improved if there
are already normal children in the sibship at
the time of enquiry. There is no appreciable
difference if the propositus is male or female.

t Normal is defined, throughout, by mental ratio
estimated to be 85 or above; Dull by mental ratio of
70 to 84; Simpleton by mental ratio of 50 to 69;
Imbecile by mental ratio of 20 to 49; Idtot by mental
ratio below 20.
36 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

When birth injury or encephalitis can be
diagnosed with certainty, the probability
that a second child will be affected is naturally much reduced and approaches the probability in the general population just in so
far as the diagnosis is certain. If the affected
child is of the mongolian type, the chance
that a second imbecile or idiot will be born
in the family is only about one in fifty: the
chance that the second affected child will
be a mongol is less than one in fifty. On the
other hand, if parents are consanguineous,
the prognosis is worsened for there is a strong
likelihood that the condition in the child is
recessively determined. In Table II, percentage expectations are given which, however, are based on only fourteen families and
