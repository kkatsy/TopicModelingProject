Trends in Fertility in England
and Wales

SOME

HE FOLLOWING FIGURES are a small
selection from the wealth of information
that is available in Chapter 4 of the
Fertility Report on the 1951 Census of England
and Wales.

Table 1 gives a general view of the fall in
average family size for different years of
marriage; the figure for 1950 contains an element of estimation for the future. The amount of
upturn in the averages for recent years is small
in comparison with earlier declines but nevertheless seems to indicate a highly significant
change in trend.

Table 2 shows the estimated total fertility of
the different ages at marriage in 1950 expressed
as a percentage of the fertility for all marriage
ages in combination, and gives the corresponding
data for marriages in 1920. Both series of figures
are rather similar.

For the same two years of marriage, Table 3
gives the proportions of mean ultimate family
size that were, or are expected to be, achieved
by the end of certain numbers of years of
marriage. Here again, the two years do not differ
greatly in this respect.

The replacement rates per thousand of
generations of women born in various quinquennia are set out in the next statement.

The Registrar General’s assessments of

hypothetical replacement rates summarizing
current experience are seven in number and
range from 965 to 1,084, with a mean value of
1,023. He forecasts that the replacement rate
of women born in 1948-53 may eventually
amount to 1,014, whereas that for women born
in 1903-08 was only 672. In an analysis of the
causes of this change, over a forty-five-year
period, he estimates that 48 per cent, or nearly
one-half, is attributable to improvements in
mortality and 29 per cent, or over one-quarter,
is accounted for by earlier marriage and a greater
tendency to marry. Only 23 per cent, or under
one-quarter, is directly due to increased intrinsic
fertility.
