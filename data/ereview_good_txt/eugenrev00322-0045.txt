BAYES’ THEOREM AND THE
FOURFOLD TABLE.

By R.A. FIsHer. Sc.D.

In a recent issue of Biometrika (XVII, parts 3 and 4), E. S.
Pearson attempts the interesting task of examining into the truth of
‘‘Bayes’ Theorem’’ experimentally. The point is one of some historical interest. A number of mathematicians, and notably Laplace,
have considered that although, if we know nothing about the causes of
an event its probability of occurrence is certainly unknown, yet since
it must have some probability between the limits of zero and unity, it
may rightly be assumed that for events in general the probability
occurs with equal frequency in all parts of this range. The assumption would be an important one theoretically, for if it could rightly
be assumed, it would be possible to bring a number of difficult questions of uncertain inference within the domain of the mathematical
theory of probability. In the language of. modern statistics, inferences respecting samples of known populations may be made with
confidence on the basis of the theory of probability, but inferences
respecting unknown populations based upon observed samples of them,
can only be expressed in terms of probability if some such assumption.
can be made.

The common sense difficulty, which lies at the root of the matter,
is the difficulty of defining the population of ‘‘events in general.’’
Mr. Pearson has chosen no less than 12,448 different events, and
observed the frequency of occurrence of each in two samples of 20 and.
15 respectively. The result shows that the probabilities of the
events chosen by Mr. Pearson are not equally distributed between 0
and 1, but this result will scarcely daunt the supporters of ‘‘Bayes’
Theorem’’ who could easily supplement Mr,. Pearson’s collection by
a number of suitably chosen new events, and so rectify the inequality,
while it will cause no undue elation to those who deny that the assumption is justified, for they claim that the distribution is bound to depend
upon the choice made, and that the population of events in general has
no definable objective reality.

The pairs of samples observed by Mr. Pearson have, however,
another interest. They constitute the large number of 12,448 fourfold
tables observed under approximately random sampling conditions...
Now for some years it has been disputed in what manner a certain
quantity, X2, calculable from a fourfold table, is distributed by the
chances of random sampling. Professor Pearson originally took the
view, which more recently he has stoutly defended, that the distribution was such that the average value must be 3, while the writer in
1922 (J.R.S.S., LXXFV, pp. 87-94) put forward what he regarded
as a corrected distribution, having an average of only 1. Although
the writer considers that the point can be settled rigorously by purely
BAYES’ THEOREM AND THE FOUR-FOLD TABLE. 88

mathematical methods, and although Mr. Yule has carried out
extensive experiments, which completely confirm his results, yet as
the point is still disputed, it is worth while to see what the actual
average value of X2 is in the large group of fourfold tables here presented.

Divided according to the number of successes in the two samples
combined (for in the 780 cases where neither samples scored a success
the value of X2 is indeterminate) we find

In every case the average value is near to 1, in no case is it near
to 8. The general average of nearly 12,000 values is embarrassingly
close tounity. This extremely close agreement must be due to chance,
for in a sample of only 12,000 we should expect to be inexact in the
second decimal place of the average. Moreover, the problem was discussed both by Prof. Pearson and myself from the point of view of
tables containing a large number of entries; in these cases the tables
only contained 35 entries, and an exact discussion would show that the
average value of X2 should exceed unity by one part in384. The mean
to be expected is thus 1.02941 with a standard error of only .01276.
The mean value from E. S. Pearson’s sample is thus lower than.
expectation by a very small, but statistically significant amount;
showing that the conditions of independent random sampling, though
very nearly, were not exactly realised.

It is hoped that this example will remove all doubts as to the
correct treatment of the fourfold table, and of other applications of
the X2 test.
