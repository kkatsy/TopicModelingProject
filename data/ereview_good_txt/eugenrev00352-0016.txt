WAR AND THE BALANCE OF THE SEXES.

THAT it is desirable to maintain as far as possible a balance of the sexes
is a principle on which eugenists are generally agreed. The extent to
which the present war is disturbing that balance has hardly been fully
appreciated, and in this article I propose to set forth the facts concerning
the principal belligerent countries in so far as they have been ascertainable. In all the European countries involved—Great Britain, Ireland,
Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Hungary—there was at
the outbreak of war a greater or less preponderance of females in the
population. At the end of i910, or early in 1911 (when the last census
was taken in these countries), the various excesses in amount and in ratio
were as follows :— .

Excess of Females.

England and Wales ... ws. 1,179,000 ona 1067°6
Scotland wa aan 12 143,000... 10620

Hungary wes wes bes 196,000: ... 10189
Belgium _ i vee 62,000 bes 10169
Ireland be be bes 6,000 be 1002°8

The excess was, as will be seen, very considerably greater in Great
Britain than elsewhere, while in Ireland, Belgium, and Hungary it was
sufficiently slight to be ignored. During the generation immediately
preceding, i.¢., since the census of 1880-1, there was considerable diversity
in these countries as to the movement of the sex balance. In England
and Wales, Belgium, France, and Italy, the proportion of males was
falling with greater or less rapidity; in Germany, Austria, Hungary, and
Scotland, on the other hand, it was rising. In England and Wales the
excess of females had risen by 237%, in Belgium (where in 1880 the sexes
were nearly equal) by 1500%, in France by 750%, while in Italy there was
in 1880 an excess of males. The decline in Scotland was 18%, in Germany
33%, in Austria 23%, and in Hungary 40o/. Had these tendencies continued without interruption for another generation the sexes would, in the
Central Empires, have attained something near to an equal distribution,
while on the other hand, each of the allied countries would have been
faced by an emphasising of what has been most ungallantly termed “ the
problem of the superfluous spinster.”

The excess of females is not, however, spread equally over the entire
population. If those under the age of 20 are excluded we find some very
different and striking figures. Thus in 1910-11, in Germany, Belgium,
France, Scotland, Ireland, and Italy, there was an excess of males at
WAR AND THE BALANCE OF THE SEXES. 7/7

ages under 20, while in Hungary, Austria, and England the excess of
females was very small. At ages over 20 the proportion of females to
males was :—-Scotland, 1,200; England, 1,130; Italy, 1,078; Austria, 1,062;
France, 1,060; Germany, 1,054; Hungary, 1,035; Belgium, 1,033; Ireland,
1,024. Here again the position of Great Britain is very much worse than
that of any of the others.

Finally, if we exclude all those under 20 and over 60, including only
the mass of those who form the economic and reproductive elements of
these countries, we find that in 1910-11

Ireland had 995 females to 1,000 males aged 21-60.

In this, presumably the most important section of the population,
Great Britain again occupies the least desirable position, with Italy this
time in close attendance. The numbers forming the excess in this class
were :—Ireland, 5,000; Belgium, 15,000; France, 27,000; Germany,
400,000; Hungary, 167,000; Austria, 316,000; Italy, 660,000; Scotland,
100,000; England and Wales, 838,000.

It is in this section that the war has produced and is producing the
disturbance of the sex balance. The men who have fallen practically all
come within these age limits; they were all potential or actual progenitors.
In attempting to calculate the effect produced on some of the belligerents
it may be said that, without in any way pretending to exactitude, the
figures given have been based on reliable sources, and that they represent,
with approximate accuracy, the position at the end of 1917. Owing to
the lack of reliable sources of information, I make no attempt to calculate
the excess of females at these ages for Belgium, France, or Italy. For
Great Britain the ratio of females to males in this age-class had increased
to 1,150; for Germany, Austria, and Hungary it was about 1,200. It is
probable that, bad as is the position in this respect in Great Britain, it is
better than in the Central Empires, and the relative positions have been
reversed. It is, of course, impossible to forecast what the ratios will be
at the end of the war. Every day sees the shrinkage of the male element
in the populations of the belligerent countries, and the problem that will
have to be faced by each one of them in this respect will apparently defy
solution. Moreover, it is quite within the bounds of possibility that
emigration, stayed by the war, will be resumed with increased vigour at
its conclusion.

It was pointed out earlier in this article that before the war the excess
was already a rising quantity in this country, in Italy, in Belgium, and
in France. The causes that affect the sex distribution of a country are
7 8 EUGENICS REVIEW.

three—the sex ratio at birth, the sex ratio at death, and migration. Great
Britain, and more particularly England and Wales, has a smaller excess
of males at birth than any other European country. It has also a higher
ratio of male to female mortality than any of the countries named. In
regard to the former there has been a marked increase in the excess of
male births among “ war babies” in this country. During the ten quarters
up to the end of 1917, in which all births registered were those of “ war
babies,” the ratio was 1,045 boys to 1,000 girls. During the 4o years
preceding the war in which birth registration was enforced under penalty
in this country the ratio was 1,038. It stood at 1,043 in 1875, and was as
low as 1,032 in 1898, so that there have been considerable fluctuations,
but for a continuous period of 24 years the highest ratio recorded in that
period was 1,041. Moreover, during the 4o years the ratio has never
remained above the mean (1,038) for more than four successive quarters,
whereas during the period from June, 1915, it has remained consistently
above that average, never falling below 1,043. I do not propose to enter
into the highly interesting question as to what may have been the causes
of this increased ratio; for the immediate purposes of this article it is
sufficient to point out the incontrovertible fact that there has been a
marked rise in the proportion of male births during the war, and that
this rise has been maintained to a greater or less extent throughout. As
the Registrar-General remarked in his presidential address to the Royal
Statistical Society on November 2oth, 1917:—“A rise in the sex proportion so marked and sustained over so long a period can hardly be dismissed as an accidental circumstance.”

It will be seen, then, that even in this country there is a considerable
preponderance of males at the start of life and that the turning of the
balance in the other direction is due to an earlier loss of the male than
of the female population. As already stated, the ratio of male to. female
mortality is higher in this than in any other of the belligerent countries,
but in spite of that fact the excess of male deaths, in volume, does not
exceed the excess of male births. During the 30 years between the census
of 1881 and that of 1911 the excess of females in the population rose by
nearly half a million. In the same period the excess of male over female
births was also nearly half a million, while the excess of male over
female deaths was only 470,000. It is true that as there were more females
than males in the population there were more possibilities of female
deaths, and, had the numbers of the males been equal to the numbers of
females and the deaths been in the same proportion, the increase of
females over males in the population during the 30 years in question
would have been nearly equal to what actually was the case. This,
however, does not represent the facts of the case. The males withdrawn
from the population by migration are not spread equally over the whole
of the age-classes. They come mainly from the more virile and vigorous
age-classes, with few from the extremes of infancy or of old-age, at both
of which periods the ratio of mortality of males to females is in excess of
the mean for the whole of life. Thus in the first year of life the ratio of
male to female deaths is nearly double what it is for all ages, and the
WAR AND THE BALANCE OF THE SEXES. 79

numbers of migrants of that age must be very small indeed. Allowing
for these facts, it may be assumed that, with a number of males equal to
the actual number of females, the addition of males being made to the
age-classes other than those of infancy and old-age, there would have
been an increase of the excess of females in the 30 years 1881-1910 of
about a quarter of a million. The point that emerges from these estimates
is that, although as a matter of fact the increase in the excess of females
between 1881-1910 was actually due to migration, there would have been
an increase—smaller, it is true—had migration been entirely suspended.
In other words, the sex balance in this country is being turned against
the males by natural causes, the more persistent vitality of the female
being more potent than the plurality of males at birth.

Thus in England and Wales in 1915 the excess of deaths of males in
the civilian population was all but equal to the excess of males born in
that year, although the civil male population, as estimated, was in the
proportion of 1,000 males to 1,210 females. In 1916 there was an excess
of male births of nearly 19,000, while the excess of male deaths in a
civilian population in which there were estimated to be 1,000 males to
1,300 females, was over 10,000. Last year, when in the estimated civil
population there were 1,400 females to 1,000 males, the excess of male
deaths in that population practically wiped out the 15,000 excess of male
births,

For the immediate problem that will confront this country in regard
to the disproportionate numbers of females of fertile age I can see no
satisfactory solution. The Dean of St. Paul’s has suggested that
“ systematic plans of colonisation should be worked out and young women
should be sent out in sufficient numbers to keep the sexes equal.” How
far would this meet the situation? By the end of the war the small
excess of males in New Zealand will probably have disappeared altogether. In the Commonwealth of Australia there was in 1914 an excess
of 64,000 males at ages between 21 and 45. Of these some thousands have
already married in this country, and the toll of battle will seriously cut
down the numbers to return. There remains only Canada as to which I
have no recent reliable statistics. At the census of 1911 there was no
appreciable surplus of males in the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, or Quebec, while in British
Columbia, Manitoba, and the North-West, there was an excess of about
400,000 males. Canada, therefore, could profitably absorb about one-half
of the additional excess caused in this country by the war alone, leaving
five-sixths of the total excess untouched.

As for the future the only remedy seems to lie in the greater preservation of male lives. How far this can be effected it is impossible to.
say. There is, as has already been remarked, a great disparity in the
sex mortality of this as compared with other countries, and the aftereffects of the war are likely to emphasise the excess of male deaths
among those who have taken part in the struggle. But something might
be effected with the coming generations. Before the war the only period
of life in this country at which the rate of mortality was about equal
80 EUGENICS REVIEW.

was at the ages between 5 and 15, when it was actually slightly lower for
males. In Scotland it was about equal between the ages of 5 and 35.
In Italy from the age of 1 to 35 the male rate was actually lower than the
female. The results are shown in the census returns for the various
countries. In England and Wales the males have lost their initial
advantage by the time that the age of 15 has been reached; at the age
of 40 the females show an excess of nearly 600,000. In Scotland the
females only overtake the males after attaining their majority. In
Ireland the female population only overtook the male in the sixties. In
Holland it is in the thirties, in Sweden in the forties, as it is in Switzerland and in Germany. In Austria and in Hungary it is much the same
asin our own country. These countries show without exception a higher
initial plurality of male births with a lower ratio of male to female
mortality than our own country, and this is equally true of Scotland
and of Ireland as compared with England and Wales. In most of them
also the death-rate is higher than in this country, and it may be urged
that in these cases the lower male ratio of mortality is due rather to
failure to preserve the female lives than to success in preserving the
males. But this argument does not apply all round. In the Netherlands
and in the Scandinavian Peninsula the death-rate is slightly lower than
in England and Wales, while the age constitution of their populations
before the war was not materially different from our own. They were
in fact slightly older populations as a whole. Thus England and Wales
had 72'457% of its total population under 4o years of age; Norway, 67°95;
The Netherlands, 73°24; Sweden, 69:06. At ages over 60 England and
Wales had 804°; Norway, 11°03; Netherlands, 898; and Sweden, 11'95.
At ages under 5, where mortality is relatively very high (over 207% of
total mortality) our country had the smallest proportion of its total
population, only 10'70'/, while Norway had 11°99; The Netherlands,
12°59; and Sweden, 11°21. It will thus be seen that the age constitution
of these populations is less favourable than our own. Yet the ratio of
male to female mortality in each of them is considerably lower. The
extent of this difference will be appreciated when one considers that,
had the deaths of males to females in our own country during the 30
years under review been on the same level as in the three countries in
question, we should have saved approximately about half a million male
lives. In that case the growth of the excess of females in our population
during that period would have been so slight as to be negligible. The
solution of the problem of the future balance of the sexes may possibly
lie in this direction—the lowering of the male death-rate in Great Britain
until it bears the same relation to the female rate that it does in the
countries cited. What this would ‘mean may be thus illustrated: In
the triennium r1g1o-12 the number of males who died in each million
annually was 14,730. If the deaths among males had been in the same
ratio to the deaths among females as obtains in the three countries,
Norway, Netherlands, and Sweden, the deaths per million males would
have been 13,750, and we should have saved as nearly as possible 1,000
lives per million living and kept the sex balance. This, then, is our
object, which should not prove unattainable.
