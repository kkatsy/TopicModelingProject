Birth Control and Eugenics in Holland.
By C. V. Dryspa.Le, O.B.E., D.Se., F.R.S.E.

In my paper on ‘‘A Guiding Principle for Practical Eugenic
Reform,’’ which appeared in this Review for January last, I called
attention to the fact that birth-control information had been more
widely disseminated among the mass of the people in Holland than in
any other country, and pointed out some of the satisfactory phenomena
which have been observed in that country—notably the rapid increase
in the Stature of the Dutch conscripts. But Miss van Herwerden takes
exception in the last issue of the REVIEw to the suggestion that there
is any connection between this increase and the neo-Malthusian propaganda, pointing out quite correctly that the improvement in stature
had started at least as early as 1863—many years before the commencement of such propaganda. She also states that this improvement has
recently been arrested and indeed reversed, the proportion of conscripts over the height of 1.7 metres (5ft. 7in.) having fallen from
39.7% to 35.2% between 1884 and 1898, but in this she appears to be
in error as the figures given me from official sources* show a rise from
32.95% to 37.37% in that period, and a further rise to 51.59% in 1918,
without any sign of arrest. These figures are for the whole of Holland,
and in order to exhibit the variations most clearly the diagram Fig. 1.
has been prepared. This shows distinctly that there was a rapid
reduction in the numbers of the lowest grade from 1863 onwards and
that both this and the next grade have become almost evanescent in
the last few years. The next grade between 5ft. 3in. and 5ft. 84in.
showed an increase up to 1881 followed by a steady and accelerating
fall from that year, while the highest grade (above 5ft. 7in.) exhibited
a slow rise up to about 1875 followed by a rapid one which shows no
signs of being arrested. This is certainly a most favourable sign,
to whatever cause it may be attributable. Possibly your correspondent’s figures refer to Amsterdam only.

In order to form an opinion as to how far the birth-control movement in Holland has had any influence on this and other phenomena
it will be well at this point to give a brief history of this movement.
+Miss van Herwerden states that the neo-Malthusian propaganda had
not had any influence on the population as a whole by the year 1889

and she is certainly correct in that the organised movement in Holland
did not start until that time, and its effect must have been very slow
at first. But, like most other writers on this subject, she appears to
have overlooked the extraordinary effect of the Bradlaugh-Besant
trial of 1876, which from the biological and eugenic point of view will
certainly come to be recognised as the greatest event in human history
-~—whether for good or evil. The diagram Fig. 2. shows the course of
the birth and death-rates and infantile mortality in Holland from the
year 1853, and shows in common with a number of other countries that
the birth-rate was rising more or less rapidly to the year 1876, after
which it suddenly commenced to fall and has gone on falling to this
day. Fig. 3 is a similar diagram for England and Wales for comparison, and these and other diagrams show clearly that in 1876 civilized
humanity consciously commenced its final severance from the lower
animals in determining to replace automatic by voluntary procreation,
and refusing blind subjection to the struggle for existence. There can
be no doubt that even without any organized propaganda this trial
would have brought about a steady decline in the birth-rate, and all
that any propaganda has been able to do is to accelerate the process
and to try to direct it on eugenic lines. .

Until recently the only two countries which have attempted the
latter are England and Holland. The English neo-Malthusians were
strong negative eugenists from the inception of the movement in 1877,
but all their attempts at introducing birth-control to the masses were
foiled by the opposition of the upper classes and more especially by
the persistent hostility of the Socialists. In Holland, however, a
more scientific attitude was shown, and in 1876 Dr. S. van Houten
(late Minister of the Interior) wrote a strong article in favour of neoMalthusianism in the Vragen des Tajds, and Mijnheer Greven received
his doctorate in law for a dissertation on the subject; while several
other prominent men, including M. Heldt the leader of the National
Labour Party, enthusiastically championed the doctrine. In consequence when the International Medical Congress was held in Amsterdam
in 1879, arrangements were made for the late Dr. C. R. Drysdale
(President of the English Malthusian League) to address a large public
meeting, and a powerful league was immediately formed which was
able to commence a vigorous propaganda. Thirty-four members of
the medical profession joined within the first five years, and a practical
leaflet describing contraceptive methods was issued in 1886.

At the commencement of 1882, Dr. Alletta Jacobs, the first lady
doctor in Holland and wife of Mijnheer Gerritsen a prominent founder
of the league, opened a gratuitous clinic for poor women and children
in Amsterdam and gave neo-Malthusian advice and contraceptive
information ; and in 1888, Dr. Mensinga a gynecologist of Flensburg,
published a description of his contraceptive device which has proved
the most satisfactory practical means, and which has been adopted by
the Dutch league and at the centre recently opened by the New Generation League in South London. By 1892 practical instruction could
be obtained by poor people in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Groningen,
and the Dutch League entered into a period of intense activity. 35,000
practical booklets were distributed in a single year, and midwives.

were trained and paid to give gratuitous consultations. In 1899 it
was found desirable to change the personnel of the League in order to
make it more popular with the masses, and Dr. and Mme. Rutgers
took up the work with such success that the league now numbers about
7,700 members in a country of only about 7 million inhabitants. As
the salaried midwives had not proved thoroughly satisfactory, Dr.
Rutgers took the bold step of instructing lay-nurses in the best contraceptive technique, and at the present time there are about 55 of
these trained women distributed among the principal towns of Holland,
besides several medical practitioners who appear on the League’s list
as prepared to give advice. These nurses receive no salary but are
allowed to charge a small fee for advice and appliances, and they are
eagerly consulted by poor women.

There can be no doubt therefore that practical information has
been available to the poorer clasess on a fairly large scale in Holland
for many years, and we have now to consider its results; particularly
from the eugenic standpoint.

It must however be recognised from the outset that it is extremely
difficult to distinguish between eugenic and environmental phenomena.
The question of the height of conscripts is an obvious case in point, as
it appears highly probable that height is considerably affected by
nutrition, and especially at the adolescent period. Before the settlement of Europe in 1815 Holland had passed through a long period of
war and economic distress, and it seems likely that this resulted in a
serious diminution of stature from which she was recovering when
figures first began to be published in 1863. The rising birth-rate up
to 1876 which is also noticeable in many other countries was associated
with an improvement in economic conditions due to the extension of
industry and transport, and this no doubt had an influence on stature.
The acceleration of this increase of stature from about 1879 would be
considered by neo-Malthusians to be duc to the fall of the birth-rate
from 1876 which was accompanied by a rapid fall in the general and
infantile mortality suggesting better nutrition, and consequent almost
immectiate effect on the young men coming up for measurement at the
age of 18. But of course this is a matter of opinion, and in any case
it is quite obvious that such a change could only be of an environmental
and not of a genetic character. When however we find the rapid
relative increase of the highest grade persisting up to the present time,
and contrast it with the revelations as to the physique of our own conscripts in the late war it seems reasonable to suppose that something
more than purely environmental causes are at work, and that there is
now some selective agency in favour of better physique. One thing
however is clear—that the vigorous birth-control propaganda in
Holland has certainly been accompanied by a most gratifying improvement both in the number and stature of the young men, and this
decidedly appears to negative the frequently made assertions that
birth control must operate for race degeneration or deterioration.

Coming now to the vital statistics themselves, Holland most certainly shows the most satisfactory progress of any country in Europe,
although here again experts must decide for themselves whether it is
of hereditary or environmental significance. Prior to 1876 the general
476 EUGENICS REVIEW.

death-rate fluctuated considerably but averaged about 26 per thousand
with a very slightly falling tendency. Since that time however, it
has fallen rapidly and steadily and even faster than the birth-rate so
that in 1912 when the birth-rate had fallen from 37 to 28 or by 9 per
1000, the death-rate had fallen to 12 or by 14 per 1000 and the rate of
natural increase had risen to 16 per thousand,—the highest figure in
Europe. A slight rise both of the birth-rate and the death-rate
took place in 1913 & 14, followed by a rapid fall of the birth-rate and
a rise of the death-rate in the war years. *

It will be seen that this compares very favourably with the corresponding figures for this country, where a fall of the birth rate from 36.3
to 22, or of 14.3 per thousand has been accompanied by a fall of the
death-rate from about 21.5 to 12 or of only 9.5 per thousand, producing
a diminution of the rate of natural increase from 13.8 to 10 per thousand
instead of an increase to 16 per thousand as in Holland. From the
Malthusian point of view this indicates a diminution of the national
efficiency in our own country and an improvement in Holland, as the
rate of increase according to the Malthusian theory depends upon the
increase of subsistence which in turn depends upon the efficiency of
production, but this point of view will not necessarily appeal to everyone. At any rate the combination of acceleration of natural increase
with improved physique accompanying a rapidly falling birth-rate
is of immense significance to those who fear the effect of birth-control on
the military strength of a nation.

The course of the infantile mortality in Holland is also very
interesting. The diagram shows that there has been a rapid and steady
fall over the whole period of the declining birth-rate (with a slight
arrest during the war period) and that it had fallen to only 73 per 1000
in 1920—the lowest figure in Europe. The contrast between this and
our own country is striking as we had actually a rising infantile
mortality from about 1881 to 1899 followed by a very rapid fall. This
again would be explained by neo-Malthusians on the ground that in
Holland the fall of the birth-rate was made common to all classes by
the freedom of dissemination of birth-control information, thus
reducing poverty and overcrowding; whereas in our own country it
took many years before it began to penetrate down to the artizan
classes, and it was in fact about this time that the papers began to
report a diminution in the supply of children to the public elementary
schools. Others will no doubt ascribe the recent fall of infantile
mortality to the efforts which have been made to combat it, but it does
not appear that such strenuous efforts have been necessary in Holland.

Another point of considerable importance is the comparison between the infantile mortalities of various parts of Holland, and especially between those of the urban and country districts. Taking the
latter first, it is the general impression that large cities are especially
prejudicial to infant life as compared with the country, but the figures
for Holland show quite the reverse in recent years, as seen by the following table :— !

*The abnormally high death rate in 1918 which is shown also in England and
other countries, is due to the great influenza epidemic.

It will be seen that although the general and infantile mortality
(as well as the birth-rate) was higher in the towns than in the country
as a whole in the first period, the reverse is the case in 1912 & 1921, and
that the infantile mortality in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and the Hague
has fallen materially below that of the Kingdom. The general death
rate in the two latter towns has now fallen to practically the value of
New Zealand which has for many years held the record.

Of equal interest is the comparison of the infantile mortalities in
the different provinces of Holland as follows:

Here we sée in the first place that the order as regards the fall of
the infantile mortality is nearly the same as that of the fall in the
birth-rate ; secondly that North Holland started with the highest birthrate and infantile mortality ending with the lowest birth-rate, and the
lowest infantile mortality next to Friesland ; and thirdly that Limburg (a
notedly Roman Catholic province) started with the lowest birth-rate
and nearly the lowest infantile mortality, but has kept its birth rate
practicaly constant with an actual rise of the infantile mortality to the
highest in Holland. Comment on these figures seems superfluous.
If a low infantile mortality is regarded as a eugenic feature, the eugenic
effect of birth control in Holland appears to be established beyond
dispute, but it is again only fair to say that a neo-Malthusian would
regard this reduction of the infantile mortality as principally due to

The only other evidence bearing on eugenic questions which I have
been able to obtain are the figures for still births during the last ten
years :—

Year. 1910 11 12 13 WM 15 16 #17 #18 19 20
Still Births
% oftotal births 38:9 3-838 3-75 3:72 3-75 3-81 3-85 3-77 3-78 3-47 3-26.

Except for the war years 1914—18 there has been a distinct reduction of the proportion of still-births, which may perhaps be taken as
an indication of a reduction of venereal disease. The proportion of
still-births appears to be low in comparsion with that of other countries.
for which I have seen figures, which would appear to indicate both a
small amount of venereal disease and of attempts at abortion. The
comparative figures for maternal mortality from puerperal fever
which have been compiled by Miss Ettie Rout are also of interest:

Australia (1920) 5-0

In this table Holland stands at the head of the list as having the
lowest maternal mortality of all countries, although Sweden runs it
very close. It is worthy of note that the United States where birthcontrol information has been, until recently, rigidly repressed, has
nearly three times the maternal mortality of Holland, although
Belgium which has a very low birth-rate is still worse. It would
appear at any rate that sex-hygiene must be at a high level in Holland
for such a favourable result to be shown; and this low mortality is one
more proof of the good conditions which prevail there. This is also
indicated by the much closer equality of numbers of the sexes in
Holland (3,410,262 males, 3,455,052 females at the end of 1920) than
in most European countries, and by the small number of emigrants
averaging only about 2,500 annually. It is also indicated by the
figures for wages and the cost of living which show that real wages
were rising in Holland for some time before the war when they were
falling in most other countries, and that this rise has been accelerated
during the war period in spite of the very great rise in prices. But
these facts are of course only of eugenic importance in so far as they
may indicate an improvement in the efficiency of the people, which, in
combination with the rapid increase of population, they certainly
appear to do.
BIRTH CONTROL AND EUGENICS IN HOLLAND. 479

A distinguished American sociologist who is scientifically interested in the birth-control question but is not a propagandist or advocate, has just been investigating this question in Holland, and informs
me that he is satisfied that sex-morality is in a comparatively high
state, that there is relatively little venereal disease and abortion,
and that the economic and social conditions of the Dutch people are
on the whole good. Unfortunately I have not been able to obtain any
figures for the incidence of venereal disease, and the figures for infantile
and maternal mortality must be taken as the only evidence on this
point. From the Eugenic standpoint the most important feature
would have been the comparative fertility in the various social grades
and professions, but I regret that I have been unable to get any figures
on this point. But the authority above mentioned agreed with my
own impression that there is a much greater uniformity in the size of
families in different social grades in Holland than in this country.

The bulk of the figures quoted or given in the diagrams have been
taken from the official Jaarcijfers voor het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden,
but those relating to the height of recruits have kindly been furnished
me by Dr. J. Rutgers, to whom I am also indebted for the information
eoncerning the history of the Dutch birth-control movement.
