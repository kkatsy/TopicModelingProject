HUMAN FERTILITY
I.—A Further Study of German Women

By Dr. med. WILLY WAGNER-MANSLAU
Translated by E. O. LORIMER

OTH in Monograph VI of the

Eugenics Research Association and

in my article on ‘‘ Human Fertility ’’ in the last number of the
Eucenics Review (October 1932), I maintained the thesis that the decline in the
birth rate was the outcome of an immense
evolutionary change in the human animal
(Umziichtung der Menschheit) due to the
fact that a large proportion of men were
driven to marry for money and to seek their
wives, therefore, in a social stratum lower
than their own. Since the largest dowries
are to be found, ceteris paribus, in the
families with fewest children, it came about
that the wives thus chosen from the lower
strata represented a selection in favour of
low fertility. If this contention is to be
accepted the first desideratum is some
proof of the existence of heritable differences in the degrees of fertility. This was
Statistically proved in the article on
‘“Human Fertility ’? cited above, and my
thesis was supported by conclusions drawn
from statistics of the most varied kinds. It
is however desirable further to corroborate
my deductions by actual figures.

This is rendered possible by the mass of
statistics supplied by the Court Calendars
from 1776-1932, and the Gotha Almanachs :
the Counts’ from 1834-1932, and the Freiherren from 1854-1932.* I have been able
to investigate 6,157 marriages and accurately to determine the number of children
of the marriage from which each parent
sprang. This number IJ denote by the words
Sibship Figure—SF (Abstammungszah]).

The 6,157 marriages where the SF for

both man and wife could be ascertained,
naturally form a small proportion of the
material. As a general rule only the husband’s SF is given in the Almanach, and
the wife’s family is frequently not represented at all. It is never included, of course,
when she is of middle-class origin, and is
often omitted even when she is of noble birth.
These 6,157 marriages, for which detailed
information was available, represent, therefore, a selection from a large material (of
16,975 marriages). ‘The question at once
presents itself—is the selection a fair sample
of the whole? It is easy to find a touchstone
for the men by comparing their figures with
those of the whole. In the case of the women
this is impossible, since there are no total
statistics, but we can achieve a_ sufficiently exact approximation by hypothetically equating the total of the women
with that of the men.

Tables I, II, and III show, at twentyyear intervals, the SF of all married noblemen between the ages of forty and sixty
from the Court Calendars 1776-1932, of the
Counts from the Gotha Almanachs 18341932, and of the Freiherren from the
Almanachs 1854-1932. From the individual
SF’s the average SF for groups and subgroups is calculated and tabulated in Tables
I-III. The material has been sub-divided
according as the husband took his wife from
the Old Nobility (ON) the New Nobility
(NN), or the Middle Classes (MC).

Similarly, Tables IV, V, and VI show
the SF’s for all the men and women of those
marriages where the SF was ascertainable
for the wife as well as for the husband.

It is evident that the groups and subgroups of the three last tables show, in the
main, the same SF’s for the men of the 6,157
selected marriages as the first three tables

297

Cc
298

show for the total of the men. There can
be no question of our chosen marriages
representing a selection from families with
either a markedly strong or a markedly
weak fertility factor. The SF’s of the
women, on the other hand, show marked
differences according as the woman belongs
by birth to the Old or to the Newer
Nobility.

The last columns in Tables IV and V
show that (with two negligible exceptions)
the SF of the NN women is markedly lower
than that of the ON women; whereas
column 4, with its constant interchange of
plus and minus, shows that between the
figures in columns 2 and 3 there are no
similar considerable differences of SF among
the men.

This is confirmed by the lack of mathematical support for the total figures in
Table VI, whereas the differences of the
average SF for the total of the ON and the
NN women are mathematically assured.

Now when we try to form a clear conception of how these differences of SF between
women of the Old and New Nobility bear
on the decline of the birth rate, we are confronted with the unfortunate fact that we
know practically nothing about the inheritance of human fertility beyond the bare
fact that it is demonstrably heritable. We
do not know by how many genes it is
determined nor what is the nature of their
transmission. Since it is a physiological
property, we are fairly safe in assuming
that fertility is dependent on _ several
factors whose varying co-operation is
responsible for varying grades of fertility.

The only accurate knowledge of these
questions we possess, is that established in
my ninth and tenth* articles—that as the
parents themselves spring from large or
small families the number of their own
children will fluctuate accordingly. The
moment, however, that we seek seriously to
determine the influence of the mother’s SF
on her fertility, we are up against the
disturbing fact that while the fertility of
marriage can be expressed by a number—

*To be published in Archiv, f. sociale-Hygiene
und Démographie.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

viz. the number of children—this is not
the case with the potential fecundity of
the marriage, since this depends on two
people. I have tried to minimize this difficulty, pending further knowledge, by taking
as the numerical expression of the potential
fecundity of a marriage, the arithmetical
mean between the SF’s of the two parents.
Since we find from Tables I-III that the
SF’s of the men who married ON wives are
approximately identical with the average
SF of those who married NN wives, this
method permits us statistically to estimate
the influence of the lower SF’s of the women
on the number of children who spring from
their marriages.

Table VII brings together all the marriages dealt with in Tables IV-VI. To get
the largest possible sub-divisions I have
here abandoned the plan of separating
Princes, Counts, and Freiherren, and have
tabulated the combined material according
to the dates of marriage, all marriages prior
to 1832 forming one group.

Table VII demonstrates very clearly that
the arithmetic mean of the average SF’s of
the men who married ON women is absolutely constant. Correspondingly, we find
the number of children resulting from these
marriages roughly the same at all periods.
Only in the two latest periods is there a
definite tendency for the number to fall off.
My article in the October REvIEw gives the
biological explanation of this phenomenon.
In contrast to this the arithmetic mean of
the SF’s of marriages with NN women
shows from the outset an unmistakable tendency to grow smaller and, correspondingly,
the number of children issuing from these
marriages inclines to decrease. The most
interesting columns, however, are those
showing the differences of SF and number
of children. They clearly demonstrate that
in the main the two run parallel. The two
exceptions in the first and fourth periods are
susceptible of explanation : the first period
deals with very small numbers, only 285
and 52 marriages. It must also be recalled
that the Court Calendars of 1832 and earlier |
usually omit the junior branches of the
higher nobility which experience shows to
HUMAN FERTILITY

be the most fertile of all. The material of
the earliest period is therefore not representative and must be considered as of little
value for demonstration.

In the fourth period the remarkably high
difference recorded in the last column is
accounted for by the exceptionally high
figure, 3°28, in column 5. The figures were
carefully checked a second time and the
number proved to be correct. I have therefore calculated the mean error and supplied
it. The result shows that the material is
insufficient, and that while the other figures
had closely approached the mean, those
yielding 3°28 had accidentally failed to do
so. In spite of this, the final result clearly
shows that over the whole material the
difference between the average number of
children of ON and NN mothers is so
marked that it may be considered mathematically established.

If we now summarize the conclusions of
this work, we find mathematical proof that
wives of a lower social grade—married for
their money—have an average SF only
eight-ninths of that shown by the women of
ON birth. I have shown in my ninth and
tenth articles that the higher or lower SF
corresponds to a higher or lower rate of
children per marriage; and it is therefore
clear that the selection of these women of
lower social status represents a selection in
favour of lower fertility. It was further
concluded that the marriage with these
women of lower fertility would be bound to
bring about a lowering of phenotypical
fertility.

This conclusion is strengthened by the
fact that ON women who marry in their
own rank have through the centuries maintained their fertility almost unaltered down
to the most recent times. While side by
side with them, in precisely the same social
and economic conditions, the parallel group
of NN women show a progressive decline in
fertility.

Finally we observe that the decrease in
the number of children in the families of the
NN mothers has proceeded pari passu with
the decrease in the arithmetic mean of the
SF’s of the NN wives and their husbands.
