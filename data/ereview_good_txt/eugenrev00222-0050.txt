European Population Contrasts

SOME

[os PLACE OF the United Kingdom
as the largest population unit in postwar Europe has recently been yielded
to the Federal German Republic, and if
present trends continue our numbers may be
equalled by those of France and of Italy before
the end of the century. This may therefore be an
appropriate moment for a short survey of recent
European population trends. Attention is
directed to Western Europe, which for convenience has been regarded as consisting of the
“Six” of the European Customs Union and the
“Outer Seven” of which Great Britain is the
mainstay.

The latest population estimates and the percentage growth over the last ten years are as
follows:

PER CENT
INCREASE
1949 1959 IN 10
COUNTRY (millions) YEARS

Belgium 8-6 9-1 6
France 41-4 45-0 9
Italy 46°3 49-1 6
Luxembourg 3 3 (10)
Netherlands 10-0 11:3 13...
West Germany 47-1 52°9 12

The “‘Six”’ 153-7 167°7 9
Austria 6°9 7:0 1
Denmark 4-2 4°5 7
Norway 3-2 3-6 10
Portugal 8-3 9-0 9
Sweden 7:0 7:5 7
Switzerland 4:6 5-2 13
United Kingdom 50:3 52:1 4

The “‘Seven’”’ 84-5 88-9 5
All Thirteen 238-2 256°6 8

Apart from Austria, Britain has the slowest
rate of population growth of all the countries
shown, and one of only about half the average
speed of increase for Western Europe as a whole.

FACTS

It is possible to analyse the growth into its
components of births, deaths and other movement approximately as follows (figures per
thousand population per annum):

BIRTHS DEATHS OTHER NET TOTAL

COUNTRY

Belgium 17 12 +1 6
France 19 13 +3 9
Italy 18 10 —2 6
Luxembourg 16 12 +6 10
Netherlands 22 8 —1 13
West Germany 16 11 +7 12
Austria 16 12 —3 1
Denmark 18 9 —2 7
Norway 19 9 — 10
Portugal 24 12 —3 9
Sweden 15 10 +2 7
Switzerland 18 10 +5 13
United Kingdom 16 12 — 4

A substantial part of the high growth rate of
Western Germany is attributable to immigration,
and the same would seem to be true of Luxembourg and Switzerland. Most of the other
residual differences are small, and probably
not of much significance, although there appears
to have been some emigration from Portugal
and Italy and immigration into France.

Death rates are low in Holland, Denmark and
Norway, and this well-known fact accounts
for part of the rapidity of population growth in
these countries. Otherwise, however, this element is fairly constant and there is more variability as regards fertility. As for the United Kingdom, a relatively low birth rate and a high death
rate (both associated with an above-average agedistribution) and a net balance of migration
(see also page 70 of the present issue of the
REVIEW) all contribute to the comparative
immobility of its population size. The recent
increase in the birth rate and rise in immigration
have, however, raised the net rate of growth
from 4 to 6 per thousand per annum at the
present time.
