Murray, J. A.. M.D., B.Sc. Cancerous Ancestry and the Incidence of
Cancer in Mice. (Fourth Scientific Report of the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund.) London. Taylor and Francis, 1911.

THE memoir under review is an attempt to determine statistically whether
mice, the immediate ancestors of which are known to be cancerous, are
more liable than others to develop the disease. The method employed
1S a comparison of the percentage of deaths due to cancer among two
classes of mice differing thus in respect to their ancestry. As the incidence of the disease is very different in the two sexes and at different
ages, it was thought necessary to divide each of the two classes into
groups acording to age and sex, as only groups similar in these respects
could fairly be compared. The amount of material available was only
sufficient for the satisfactory statistical treatment of the females, and the
inquiry was therefore limited to carcinoma of the mamma which is the
preponderant form among them. The essential details of the comparison
are contained in the table given below, which deals with 340 mice about
which it was known that either the mother or one or both grandmothers,
or all three, were cancerous, and 223 with cancer in their remote ancestry
but not among their mothers and grandmothers. Both classes were bred
and kept under similar environmental conditions, and are grouped
according to age. The number dealt with in each age group are entered
in the upper part of the table, and percentage affected with cancer of the
mamma in the middle part, while the difference of the percentages at
each age, together with their probable errors, are recorded below :—

It will be seen that at each age the percentage of mice affected is
higher in the first-named class than in the second. To the difference of
the percentage in the three central age groups significance may be
attached as they are largely in excess of their probable errors, it is
therefore exceedingly unlikely that they are due solely to chance. Not
much weight could be given to the differences in the outer groups if they
were considered separately, but taken in conjunction with the others they
help to justify the author’s conclusion, which, however, he refers to as

rovisional, “that female mice in whose ancestry cancer of the mamma

as occurred not further back than the grandmothers are distinctly more
liable to develop the disease spontaneously in this organ than those in
whose ancestry cancer is more remote.” He goes on to say “ the increased liability is probably of the nature of a predisposition of one
particular tissue or organ system to undergo cancerous transformation
under the wear and tear of life.” EDGAR SCHUSTER.
