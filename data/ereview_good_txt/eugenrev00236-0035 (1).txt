A STUDY IN INDIAN FERTILITY

By D. GHOSH and RAMA VARMA
(School of Economics, University of Bombay)

HE present study is based upon an

investigation into the fertility of the

population of Cochin, a small feudatory state on the south-west coast of India.
The choice of the area was determined
primarily by considerations of convenience ;
one of the authors happens to be a native of
the state and possesses an intimate knowledge of the habits and customs of its people.
In itself, however, Cochin, like the rest of
Malabar of which it is a part, offers an interesting field for sociological studies.

The state has an area of 1,480 square miles
of which more than a third is covered by
dense forests, mountains and lagoons. At
the 1931 census the population of Cochin
was I,205,016 and density per square mile of
land 814. During the last fifty years the
numbers have increased by more than 100
per cent. This large rate of growth and high
density in a tract mainly agricultural in its
economy have been made possible by the
extreme simplicity of the way of living that
prevails among its people.

The predominant occupation of the people
as already stated is agriculture. Fishing
supports a fairly large number and an
appreciable percentage is engaged in industries of the domestic type. The number
of modern towns in the state is very small ;
some of those which are classified as towns
in administrative reports are in reality overgrown villages.

SOCIAL GROUPS IN THE AREA

The racial composition and the social
organization of the people are highly interesting. A pre-Dravidian race of persons who
are supposed to have migrated to this part of
India in early paleolithic times were subsequently conquered and ruled over by
matriarchal Dravidians and still later by
patriarchal Aryans. The later immigrants
intermingled with the earlier ; the males of

the conquering races crossed with the females
of the conquered and gave birth to a mixed
population that inherit the characteristics
of their diverse parentage. As a result of this
process, which is still in operation, the
population of Cochin has come to consist of
three distinct groups: the pure Aryans, the
Aryo-Dravidians and the pure Dravidians.
And on this foundation of racial divisions the
ingenious Aryans built a structure of social
distinctions more rigid and complicated than
exists in any other part of India.

At the top of the social scale are the Nambudiris, the Aryan Brahmins from the North.
They have adopted the speech and to a large
extent the customs, laws and faith of the
earlier settlers. But they retain their
patriarchal families, though the mode of inheritance and the organization of ancestral
property have been largely modified from the
Aryan standard. Intent on maintaining the
purity of their stock and the integrity of their
family estates, the Nambudiris allow only
the eldest son to marry within the community and to inherit the property of his
forefathers. The other males in the family
are permitted to consort with women in the
lower strata of society while surplus Nambudiri women are disposed of by a system of
polygamy.

The next important social group, the
Nayars and the Kshatriyas, in several re- spects the most characteristic section of the
Cochin population, is derived from tribes
which migrated to Malabar before the growth
of acknowledgment of marriage and of
patriarchal life. But their peculiar matriarchal organization, which must have been
at an early stage plastic, became stereotyped
after contact with the Nambudiris ; and to
this day the Nayars maintain the integrity of
their social order against all attacks of time
and change. They have allowed a free infusion of Aryan blood in their community,
but guarded it against intermixture with

115
116

that of lower orders by a comprehensive
system of untouchability.

The group life of the Nayars is largely
determined by two important institutions—
first, the system of inheritance known as
Marumakkathayam, and _ secondly, the
““Sambandham “’ form of marriage. According to the former, descent and inheritance are reckoned in the female line
and kinship is traced from a common
ancestress. More concretely, a man’s heirs
are his sister’s children, his own wife and
offspring having no legal claim to his family
estate. The wife lives in her mother’s house
where she is visited by her husband, generally
at night. The peculiar features of “‘ Sambhandam’”’ are the absence of ceremonies
and the lack of religious sanctions. The
union, which is based upon mutual consent,
is effected by the presentation of a cloth by
the bridegroom to the bride. Divorce and
widow-remarriage are permitted to both
parties, and conjugal freedom being not all
on one side the relation of the sexes appears
to be more rational than among most other
communities.

At the bottom of the society are castes and
tribes mainly or purely Dravidian in origin
and shut off from contact with higher orders
by an infinite variety of social barriers. They
include whole groups of artisans, fishermen,
boatmen and agricultural serfs and hillsmen,
and in the main follow the matriarchal
system in the south of the state and the
patriarchal in the north.

METHOD OF INVESTIGATION

The investigation was carried out during
the months of January to May of 1937 and
was based upon the principle of random
sampling. The 280 villages and towns in the
State were arranged in alphabetical order
and every fifth unit was chosen for study.
Within each selected unit again, every
fifteenth house, according to the serial
arrangement adopted at the 1931 census,
was chosen. We had thus a sample of nearly
3,000 houses. To elicit the requisite information a questionnaire—a copy of which is
given in the appendix—was circulated among

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

the households selected for study, and to
ensure correct returns and to clear up misapprehensions regarding the object of our
enquiry visits were paid to all the places
concerned. The questionnaire was drawn up
on the simplest lines, our aim being to secure
correct information on a few important issues
rather than vague and unreliable data on a
large number of points. Moreover, the
questions had to be so framed as to minimize
the possibility of ambiguous answers being
given. Finally, we had to steer clear of all
queries that might hurt the sensibilities of
the people. We may at this stage state that
the response received from them was satisfactory.

Some idea of the representative character
of our sample is given in Table I which
compares the distribution by religion of our
sample population and that of the 1931
census population.

Our sample included 4,170 women in the
ages of 15 to 45. We had from our knowledge
of customs prevalent among the Cochin
population adopted 15 as the lower limit of
the reproductive age period for women.
Fortunately, the data collected by us amply
support this choice. Of the women who bore |
children in the year 1936-7 virtually none
were less than I5 years in age. The upper
limit is also fairly well indicated by the age
45; only a very small percentage of the
women in our sample who gave birth to
children in the year in question belonged to
ages 45 and above.

The women in this broad age division are
first arranged in annual age periods. The
crude material when thus arranged show all
the biases and imperfections which are
familiar to students of Indian population
problems. To remove these defects we have
rearranged the original data into alternate
A STUDY IN INDIAN FERTILITY

triennial and septennial groups which are
finally resolved into quinquennial divisions.
Similar operations have been carried out in
respect of the correlated fertility data. These
adjustments—the conversion of data by
single years into five-year aggregates—give
a certain touch of unreality to the materials
presented to the reader. But they are largely
dictated by the defective nature of the
original data which have to be subjected to a
certain amount of statistical refinement before they were fit for use. The adjusted data
are presented in Table IT.

SPECIFIC FERTILITY IN 1936-7

In the year 1936-7, 4,170 women in the
ages 15-45 gave birth to 751 children. Our
sample included 18,718 persons of both sexes
at all ages. Hence the crude birth-rate of the
Cochin population was 40 per 1,000 and the

general fertility rate _751 x 1,000 or 180
4,170

per 1,000. The corresponding figures for
Ukraine, a country with the highest fertility
in Europe, were 41 and 155 per I,000 respectively in 1926-7.

Of the total births in the year 15 per cent.
were contributed by women in ages 15-19
and 63 per cent. by those aged 29 and less.
Only 17 per cent. of the children born came
from mothers aged 35 and above. Childbearing begins pretty early in this country,
and slows down at a comparatively early age.

The very large proportion of children contributed by women in the first half of the
reproductive age is due in part to the age
distribution of Cochin women and in part to

117

the large proportion of these that are already
married by the age of 29. In our sample 61
per cent. of the total number of women in
the child-bearing ages were aged 29 and less.
The influence of this factor is eliminated in
column 4 of Table II, which gives the number
of births per 1,000 women in each five-year
age group. The figures show a gradual increase in the specific fertility of women as
their age increases by five-year periods until
the peak is reached at ages 25-29 after which
the fertility rate declines gradually. The
most reproductive period of Cochin women
seems to be the ages of 25-34.

We have still to consider the influence of
civil conditions of the female population of
Cochin upon its fertility. Though marriage
is less universal in Cochin than in the rest of
India, the Census report of 1931 shows that
54 per cent. of the total female population
were either married or widowed, and according to our sample the percentage of married
among females in the child-bearing ages, i.e.
15-44, was as high as 82. This is nearly
double the ratio that obtains among any
population of Western or Northern Europe.
How important the influence of the marriage
rate is upon the fertility of women in any
age group is still more clearly indicated in
column 5 of Table II. Here it is seen that
variations in fertility per 1,000 married
women belonging to different age groups are
much less than variations in the same per
1,000 of all women married, unmarried or
widowed. Indeed, up to the age of 34 differences in specific fertility rates are very largely
due to differences in marriage rates. After
34 there is a genuine fall in fertility which is
not seriously influenced by any change in
civil condition.

GROSS REPRODUCTION RATE

From a consideration of the specific fertility of women of Cochin at different ages we
now pass on to their total fertility as a single
group. According to our sample the total
fertility of Cochin women in 1936-7 was
5,274, 1.e. to say 1,000 Cochin women who
attained and passed through the whole of the
child-bearing age without any loss of numbers by death would give birth to 5,274
118

children. This total is somewhat greater than
the corresponding figure for the Ukraine
population, in 1926-7 the difference being
due almost wholly to the larger contribution
made by Cochin women in ages I5-I9 compared to that of Ukraine women at the same
ages.

“ Total fertility includes births both of
boys and girls. For studies of the trend of
fertility it is advisable to restrict the investigation to the birth of females, the
potential future mothers.” This is done in
the gross reproduction rate, which is simply
the total fertility divided by the sex-ratio of
children at birth. In our investigation we
could not secure sufficiently reliable data
regarding the sex ratio at birth of Cochin
children. We have, therefore, to employ a
rather devious method tosecure the ratio. The
1931 Census Report of Cochin gives the sex
ratio of the first-born children in the State.
But the report of the Census of Travancore—
an adjoining state and in many respects
similar to Cochin—for the same year, gives
us data of sex ratio at birth for the first born
as well as for subsequently born children.
On the assumption that the sex ratio of the
first born influences the sex ratio for all
births we have made use of the proportion
between the sex ratio of the first and subsequently born children in Travancore to
calculate the sex ratio for all births in
Cochin. On our assumption this ratio turns
out to be 1,052 male births per every 1,000
female births. The gross reproduction rates

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

of Cochin is thus 2-22 * 7:0 9; 2-26. This
2,052

is somewhat higher than the corresponding
rate of 2:49 for Ukraine in 1926-7.

NET REPRODUCTION RATE

The gross reproduction rate is, however,
an imperfect index of population change since
it ignores the influence of mortality conditions. This influence is taken into account
by the net reproduction rate which is calculated for Cochin population in the Table III.

As Cochin has no life table of its own we
have made use of the life table of Travancore
population in 1931. From column 4 (a) of
Table III it appears that 1,000 girls born in
Cochin in 1936-7 would, on the assumptions
made, give birth to 3,700 children, in the
course of their lives. Of these children

31700 _X_1,000 i.e. 1,800, would be girls.
2,052

The net reproduction rate for Cochin in
1936-7 is, therefore, 1-80, which implies that
the population of Cochin tends, in present
circumstances, to increase by four-fifths
every generation.

RATES IN COCHIN AND UKRAINE COMPARED

The Cochin rate may now be compared
with the Ukranian. In 1926-7 the Ukranian
net reproduction rate was 1-68. A part—but
probably a negligible part—of the difference
between the two rates might have been
caused by the difference between the sex

ratios at birth of the two populations. But in
the main it seems to be due to the more
favourable mortality conditions that prevail among Cochin females in the reproductive ages. This is shown by the fact that
when the specific fertility rates of Cochin

11g

women are applied to the Ukranian population, the net reproduction rate is reduced to
1°70, which is slightly greater than the net
reproduction rate of the Ukranian population itself.
