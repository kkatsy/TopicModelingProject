INFANT WELFARE
And the Health of Schoolchildren
By H. J. MILLIGAN, M.C., M.D., D.P.H.

(Medical Officer of Health for Reading)

OTWITHSTANDING its great
achievements the infant welfare
movement has not been without its
critics. It is frequently stated that such
work results in the preservation of the unfit,
although the natural expectation and all the
evidence we have is to the contrary effect.
In any campaign the fatal casualties, in
this case represented by the infant deathrate, reflect only a proportion of the total,
and the greater the number of the fatal
casualties the greater will be the number of
those that are non-fatal. Experience
teaches us that in areas where the infant
death-rate is high there also survives a larger
proportion of children who show evidence of
diseases like rickets and tuberculosis.
A guide to the results of greater care in
infancy will be found in the physical condi
tion of the schoolchildren of the present
day, and the most reliable index of physical
condition will probably be found in the average heights and weights of children at similar ages. a

As the medical inspection of schoolchildren began only in 1908 and the work
suffered a considerable interruption during
the war, I have relied only on post-war
records for the heights and weights of the
children in my district of Reading.

These children are examined three times
during school life, at ages five, eight, and
twelve years. The records of the heights
and weights of these children for the years
1921 to 1927 inclusive have been carefully
compared. Each age group in each year
represents an average number of about five
hundred children.

Although the period is short and the
figures subject to minor fluctuations, it is
clear that both in height and weight the
children of the more recent years tend to be
the superiors of their predecessors of
the earlier years in both sexes at each
age. In. every group in both sexes
the weights show an increase, and,
with the exception of one group—probably
the result of a chance selection—the children are taller. The improved methods of
physical training have doubtless a very
beneficial effect on the older children, but
the fact that both the boy and the girl
entrants of the later years are taller and
heavier is a clear indication that the more
enlightened nurture in infancy and in the
pre-school years is having a very beneficial
effect.

Against the height and weight I have
placed the infant mortality rate for the
corresponding years of birth. There appears
to be no correlation between years of low
infant mortality rate and years of better

the complete absence of any degree of
rickets, but only such as would militate
against the child.

Our knowledge is not yet sufficient to
enable us to prevent some disease conditions, like enlarged tonsils and adenoids,
whose incidence is given in Table 2, but
these conditions are efficiently treated at an
early age before their worst after-effects
develop.

I am unable to supply the incidence of
these defects at the different ages. ‘There
is nothing in the records to indicate any
diminution in the number of children suffering from these conditions. There is always,
of course, the possibility of errors of record,
but on the whole the conditions would
appear to be stationary. In recent years
we have recorded all children previously
operated on. Amongst entrants this would
appear to be about 5 per cent., increasing
naturally with the older children to about
Io or 12 per cent.

physique in later years, nor, I think, should
it be expected. Equally, there is no evidence that in years of low infant mortality
rates a larger proportion of unfit survive to
later years.

The virtual disappearance amongst schoolchildren of rickets in any degree that is
likely to handicap these children in later
life is further evidence that the care expended in infancy is favourably reflected
during school life. There is an average
of less than one deformity due to this disease
recorded each year. ‘This does not mean

1 YES AND TEETH

Only one of our present school population
suffers from blindness as a result of ophthalmia neonatorum ; but there are some thirtyfour persons between the ages of twenty and
fifty on the register of blind persons, a large
proportion of whom date the blindness from
infancy.

No record is kept of errors of vision
amongst entrants, because of their inability
to read. Squints are, however, recorded.
The incidence of these defects (Table 2) is
fairly uniform. In the earlier years the
INFANT WELFARE 97

standard adopted was slightly lower because
of the policy that the wearing of glasses in
childhood was itself something of a handicap. The slightly higher incidence in later
years is accounted for in the main by this
fact. It is evident that there is no diminution in these conditions and I am unaware of
any policy that can be directed to their reduction or any facts to conceal their incigence with nurture.

Table 2 also shows considerable fluctuation in the degree of dental defect. I do
not regard the record as valuable because of
the very great variation in the numbers included at different ages. In the later years
the numbers in the earlier age groups, ages

6 and 7, are greater than the corresponding
numbers in the earlier years and will ultimately embrace the majority of children
examined.

Conditions like malnutrition or rickets,
whose cause is frequently immediately discernible, must be differentiated from conditions like defects of vision, whose cause is
remote and not readily discernible. But
the more experience that one gains of the
infant welfare movement and the health of
schoolchildren, the more one feels that the
work of infant welfare centres is already
reflected in later years and that the extension of both services can result in nothing
but good to future generations.
