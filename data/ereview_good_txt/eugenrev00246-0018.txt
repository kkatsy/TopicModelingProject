GALTON'S

“HEREDITARY GENIUS”

And the Three Following Generations Since 1869.*
By B. S. BRAMWELL, M.A., LL.B., F.R.S.E.

first serious study of the inheritance
of intelligence. It was published in
1869. A reprint containing no new matter
was issued in the ‘nineties. As it is now very
difficult to obtain, your Council is trying to
arrange for a reprint, and as it is nearly eighty
years since it was originally produced, I have
tried to work out a small appendix to show
whether the three succeeding generations
have confirmed Galton’s conclusions or otherwise. Dr. Blacker thought that some account
of my work would be of interest to you.
Galton makes great use of the word
“eminence.” What exactly did he mean by
it ? He thought that the variation in human
intelligence would follow a normal curve of
distribution. If so, the majority up to about
80 per cent would be found clustering fairly
close round the mean intelligence ; on the
downward side would be found the dull,
shading off gradually to the mentally deficient, and so on to idiocy. The upward side
he divided into seven classes, of which A and
B are those nearest to the mean ; as you pass
on to C, D, E, F and G, the intelligence
increases, but the number in the class
diminishes. Thus in F class he found in
theory only one person of this intelligence in
4,000. So much for theory. He related it to
fact in this way: there was a book recently
published at the time he wrote called Men of
the Time. He selected from it 500 names of
men over 50 years of age whom he thought
would be considered eminent by their contemporaries. There were about 2 million
men over 50 years of age in the British Isles
at that time. This ratio of 500 in 2 million
corresponds closely to his ‘‘ F ”’ class, which
he therefore designated ‘‘ eminent.” To
some extent it is rather indefinite.

Fortunately, since he wrote, we have in the
Dictionary of National Biography an outside
standard, closely corresponding to his stan

dard of eminence. The work was begun in the
’ninetiesand completed in sixty-three volumes
in the early years of this century. Since then
eight supplementary volumes have been
issued, coming down to 1930. It is ten times
as select as Who’s Who. It is of very high
standard and George Macaulay Trevelyan
in his English Social History described it as
“The best record of a nation’s past which
any civilization has produced.” It has, of
course, certain slight disadvantages for our
purpose. It deals only with the dead, it stops
at 1930, there must be occasional omissions,
and certain entries are for notoriety rather
than ability, but these latter are very few.

Galton picked out men of eminence in
different occupations, and then hunted out
their relatives of eminence. His basis study
was that of High Court Judges from the
reign of Charles II to 1865, 289 in all. He
gave his reasons for considering them
eminent. He found that 108, about 40 per
cent, had relatives of eminence. I think by
further research this number would be
increased. His main findings, and they are
important as they form the skeleton of his
further work, were:

1. The eminent relations of the judges are
quite out of proportion to the chance
distribution of high ability ;

2. The nearer the relationship to the judge
the greater the chance of eminence ,

3. The greater the eminence of the judge,
the larger the number of eminent
relatives ;

4. One in nine of the judges was father,
brother or son of another judge ;

5. But the ability of their eminent relatives was in no way confined to legal
ability.

He also reached the conclusion that there
was little if any difference between inheritance through the mother and the father.
And this before the days of Mendelism.

Judges
I made two enquiries into judges. First I

146
GALTON’S “HEREDITARY GENIUS ” 147

took those mentioned by Galton, who had
been appointed to the Bench after 1837, to
see what their posterity had accomplished.
They numbered 19. And second, I studied
the families of Lord Chancellors appointed
since 1865, an entirely different set of
people. They numbered 18.

Now let us see how they stand with regard
to Galton’s five points:

1. The expectation of eminent relatives for

37 men would be a fraction of I per cent. 4.

The actuality was over 100 persons.
2. The nearer relations were more eminent
than the more distant.

3. I approach this point from the reverse. 5:

Who were the judges with the greatest
number of eminent relations? Lord

chequer, and Sir J. T. Coleridge, both
with 14, Sir Frederick Pollock, Bart.,
Chief Justice C.P., Baron of the Exchequer, and Sir John Vaughan, each
with 11. Apart from legal ability
Haldane was the best student of
philosophy in his year in the four
Scottish universities, and Alderson and
Pollock were both senior wranglers at
Cambridge.

Galton found one judge in nine was
father, brother or son of another judge.
In my list eight judges out of 37 were
father, brother or son of another judge.
So far from being confined to legal
ability the 37 averaged two relatives
apiece eminent in other directions.

Chancellor Haldane with 15, Sir Ed- By way of illustration let us look at the
ward Alderson, Baron of the Ex- pedigrees of Haldane, Pollock and Alderson.

GALTON’S “ HEREDITARY GENIUS”

Statesmen

Galton had no high opinion of politicians
for these reasons: politics is not an open
profession ; he thought that the standard
was falling and nepotism was rife. As a class
he would grant prime ministers eminence,
but no others. I therefore took prime
ministers since 1869 for my study of statesmen. They had many relatives of high
position in politics, but with the exception of
Salisbury and Balfour few distinguished in
other spheres.

Let us look at Salisbury’s pedigree.

149

ningham and Tedder as instances, one from
each of the three services. They all had
eminent fathers, and two of them eminent
grandfathers.

Scientists

For scientists I took for my group the
nineteen holders of the Order of Merit. With
the exception of Hooker they do not seem to
run far back. But in several cases there is
evidence of high scientific ability in the
family. Thus Lord Kelvin’s father, brother,
nephew and cousin were all Fellows of the

My work is limited to British subjects who
have made some reputation since Galton
wrote. He was not limited by country or
period in his choice, so his examples were
frequently of the class he termed illustrious.
Thus in his selection he ranges back to
Hannibal and Alexander the Great. I have
to be content with ten leaders of the fighting
forces who happened to have been raised to
the Peerage after the late war. In all cases
except one, I found relatives of distinct
eminence. We can take Montgomery, Cun
father, brother and nephew, while the three
physicists, Lord Rayleigh, Sir Joseph Thomson and Sir William Bragg, each had a son
who is an eminent physicist, two of whom are
Nobel prize winners, and all three Royal.
Society Medallists.

Novelists |

I was rather puzzled as to how to select
literary persons of the period. I thought I
would confine myself to novelists. After all,
Bacon classified fictional history with poetry ;
150

imagination is a very important factor in it.
I asked a friend, learned in these matters, to
supply me with a list of the twelve leading
novelists in his opinion. I added to it and
made the number up to thirty. In twelve
cases I know of no able relatives, but the
other eighteen had many. There are several
points to notice; several near relatives of
distinction ; one was the son of an archbishop, another the brother of a lord chancellor, a third the brother of a senior wrangler,
a fourth first cousin of a prime minister.
Eminent grandfathers were even more numerous than fathers, which is quite exceptional. Ability displayed in the ancestry of
both parents was more common than usual.
Also ability spreading very far back.

As time is short, I will give you only one
pedigree, that of R. L. Stevenson, though I
would like to have shown you those of Aldous
Huxley and his aunt, Mrs. Humphrey Ward,
Rose Macaulay, Hugh Walpole and Virginia
Woolf, all of whom had relatives of distinction on both sides of their family.

Actors

As a contrast to novelists consider actors.
Galton regarded them as a caste in which it
was difficult to assess their histrionic ability.
He mentions the Kembles as an exceptional
family showing ability in directions other
than the stage. Havelock Ellis notes that
they are generally of humble origin, and that
they are often Irish. In a publication, Who’s
Who on the Stage, Dr. J. M. Bullough, a wellknown genealogist, has given over a hundred
pedigrees of actors. Some have been on the

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

stage for many generations. He, like Havelock Ellis, notes that the origin was frequently humble and often Celtic. Also that
they nearly always marry “ on the stage,”’ so
that Galton was right to regard them as a
caste.

From these I picked out twenty-one wellknown names. Of these few had eminent
relatives off the stage, and these few (seven
of twenty-one) were none of purely English
origin in the narrow sense of the word. Two
were of Irish and two of Scottish origin, the
other three all had foreign blood. This
struck me as strange. What about Henry
Irving? The D.N.B. stresses his Cornish
mother, Celtic again.

A comparative table of the relatives of
ability of our thirty novelists and twenty-one
actors may be of interest to you.

Classical Scholars

As regards scholars, Galton noticed how in

forty years four Kennedys (three brothers and
a nephew) and two Lushingtons (brothers)
had been senior classics at Cambridge.
Without making an exhaustive study he
recorded many instances of senior classics
having relatives of note.

151

I have been able to add many,names to
those he noted in the succeeding generations.
I have also been able to add several not mentioned by him and others of the senior
classics in the years after 1869.

I give you two pedigrees, those of Jebb
and Butler.

Mathematicians

Galton was of opinion that great mathematicians neither transmitted general ability
nor specialized mathematical ability. With
due deference, I differ on both points. Three
of our most prolific pedigrees, Alderson,
Pollock and Butler start from a senior
wrangler at or near the top. Without
making a systematic study, I was able of
my own knowledge to record eminent relatives of senior wranglers in sixteen cases. As

regards mathematical ability itself, the
following pedigree of the Turnbull-Hudson
connection is probably new to you and
highly suggestive.

Galton had a chapter on athletes largely to
point out that physical prowess and intelligence follow the same laws of inheritance.
The pedigrees of professional scullers and
cricketers in recent years confirm the conclusions he drew.

In conclusion let us compare Galton’s
aggregate figures with those I have quoted.

They will not stand a fine comparison.
His total is larger than mine (300,227), and
from his wider range includes many individuals who were “ illustrious.”’ I have included an actor group which will somewhat
lower my figures for eminent relatives. My
figure for first cousins, like his, appears to be
higher than that for other relatives in the
third degree of relationship. There is, however, one broad conclusion we may safely
draw ; it is that the number of eminent sons
has diminished woefully. I think that there
is but one explanation for this. It is the
great diminution in the number of sons. If
one has no son, one cannot have an eminent
son. Do we lose much by this tendency ?
Who can doubt it ? Think of the families of
Spenser Butler, of Lord Salisbury, of Dr.
Vaughan and many others. It is true that

153

most eminent men are not the sons of
eminent fathers. Galton puts the ratio at
2 to 9, but the two are a product from
hundreds and the nine from millions of
fathers. How does it come about that any
eminent men arise from very unlikely
parentage ? I suppose from a favourable but
very unlikely combination of genes. To take
an analogy, supposing I toss ten pennies into
the air it is very unlikely I will toss ten heads,
but it is not so wildly improbable as Jeans’s
600 monkeys playing on typewriters one of
whom would in a million years tap out by
chance the fourteen lines of a Shakespeare
sonnet. As a matter of fact ;jthe chance is
one in 1,024, and if one was dealing with
millions of tosses one would expect to
accomplish it thousands of times. But suppose nine of the pennies had heads on both
sides then one would expect to do it every
second time. This analogy is rather far
fetched because there is no sharp cut line
between those deemed eminent and those
just below them in ability.

The fact that only two-elevenths of
eminent men are the sons of eminent men
often leads to misunderstanding. It is
assumed that nine-elevenths spring haphazard from all the rest of the community.
It is probable that Galton’s E class will provide a greater fraction than any lower class,
and this will continue as one descends the
scale of intelligence. Very few eminent men
will spring from parentage in the lower half.
Has anyone ever heard of even one eminent
man both of whose parents were mentally
deficient ?
