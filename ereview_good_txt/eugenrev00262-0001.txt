In the last mentioned paper we learn that a Mean
index of 77*4 was obtained for hair form from a
sample of 50 Noluas. The Mean size or the area of
cross-section surface of hair shaft in the same
sample was ‘00315 sq. mm. The technique for
microscopic examination which was followed was

33

that of Trotter, and it is to be hoped that more
students will aim at rendering a quantitative
assessment of a physical character, which though
important, is usually left at the mercy of description.

PERIODICALS

American Journal of Physical
Anthropology

December 1941, Vol. 38, No. 4.—Growth Rate of
Chinese.—By C. Wu and S. Soong.—-Gives averages
for 40,000 cases. They show that the rate of girls’
growth slows down a little after 14, as compared
with that of boys, becomes slower still after 16,
and practically ends at 18, whereas in boys it goes
on, in some features, well beyond 20. There are
two marked spurts, one late pre-natal and one in
adolescence (say 11-14 in girls and 13-16 in boys) so
far as stature is concerned. The upper part of the
body grows more slowly than the lower in the later
stages and mass and surface increase faster than
does length. The absolute values for body measurements are smaller than among _ western
Europeans, a result, in the authors’ opinion, of
long continued poor nutrition and probably
capable of betterment. .

Blood Groups in India (twelve aboriginal peoples
in the peninsula of India).—By Eileen Macfarlane
and S. S. Sarkar.—Shows that only among
Paniyans of the western Ghats of South Malabar
who still live by hunting and collecting and have
very broad noses and very short stature, and the
Chenchus of the Eastern Ghats between Madras
and Hyderabad (a much taller group with less
broad noses) is there more A than B. The predominance of A among Paniyan is overwhelming
and their nasal breadth gives a mean nasal index
of 95:1 per cent, whereas in the other groups it
varies between 80 and 90 with Bagdi and Toda
showing averages below this, at 74:3 and 74:9
respectively. There is in general an increase in
frequencies of B and AB from east to west across
Central India ; the Todas, in the south, also have
high values for B and AB. The lowly agricultural
Oraons have shifted from the south within the past
few centuries into Chota Nagpur; they show a
relatively high frequency of O and the value for B
is higher than in any other group examined, save
the Bhils. The value for A is very low, and the
authors wonder whether they and the Paniyans
may not represent two diverse aboriginal stocks.
Averages for stature '(Paniyan 1574 mm., Oraon
1618 mm.) and nasal index (Paniyan 95-1, Oraon
82-7 because of much greater lengths) are markedly

contrasted. Apart from the Paniyans and Oraons,
the peoples examined show more A as one goes
from south to north in the peninsula.

H. J. F.

Annals of Eugenics

October 1941. Vol. 11, Part 2.—An investigation of
the physical and mental characteristics of a pair of
like twins reared apart from infancy.—By Nora
Yates and Herbert Brash.—A number of instances
of identical twins having been subjected to different
environments from infancy have been reported in
North America, but none have previously been discovered in Britain. There is good reason to believe
that these two boys, examined in their seventeenth
year, are genetically identical. The one who had
been reared in an urban environment was superior
in intelligence to his twin on the evidence of
standard tests; on the other hand, the boy reared
under semi-rural, and economically better, conditions had the advantage physically. Results of
medical examinations and intelligence tests on
both boys are fully recorded.

Uncomplicated hereditary megalocornea.—By W.
J. B. Riddell.—A pedigree containing four males
and one female showing this condition has been
investigated. Exact measurements of the corneal
diameters of four of these and of some unaffected
members of the family are compared. No individuals having defective colour vision were found,
and thus no evidence could be obtained on the
existence of a sex-linkage of the corneal abnormality. It is suggested however, that sex differences
in size of cornea, which have sometimes been
reported, may be due to the presence of sex-linked
megalocornea.

The classification of hair and eye colour upon
developmental and genetic bases.—By M. A. MacConaill.—A sample from Sheffield of 100 males of
age 21 years showed an excess of dark-eyed, blondhaired individuals, and a deficiency of blue-eyed,
dark-haired, as compared with samples of males
and females aged 30 to 40, the proportions of
individuals light in both or dark in both characters being very similar in the three samples. No
explanation of this difference is offered, though the
author appears to hold the view that it is a result
34

of incomplete development of full pigmentation by

the younger sample rather than of any change in |
Such an.

the constitution of the population.
hypothesis agrees with the increase in dark-haired
individuals amongst the older sample but is contradicted by the decrease in dark eyes. The
pigmentation types and their rates of development
may be explained in terms of the nine possible
genotypes formed by the combination of two
genetic factors ; it seems unnecessary to postulate
a linkage of these factors, as does the author, and
the data considered here give no evidence on the
possibility of such a linkage. D. J. FINNEY.

Archiv der Julius Klaus-Stiftung

1941, Vol. 16, Nos. 1-2.—Anthropologische Studie
ber die Bewohner des Tavetsch, etnes alpinen
Hochtals im Kanton Graubtinden (Schweiz).—By
Karl Hagler.—An anthropological examination of
the inhabitants of the Tavetsch, an Alpine
mountain valley in the Swiss canton of Graubiinden. LErfahrungen und Beobachtungen in der
Geburishilfe im Gabon (Afrique Equatoriale Frangatse).—By Armin Rutishauser.—Obstetrical experiences and observations made in Albert
Schweitzer’s Hospital in Lambarene. Die UnSruchtbarmachung von Menschen als Rechtsproblem,
unter besonderer Bertichsichtigung des schweizertschen Rechts.—By Rudolf von Dach.—The author,
a lawyer and officer of the Assistant Board of the
canton of Bern, discusses the necessity and
admissibility of eugenic sterilization in view of the
decreasing fertility in Switzerland, the increasing
costs of assisting the poor, and.the differential
birth-rate of mental defectives as compared with
that of normal persons. In his opinion, sterilization for eugenic reasons is permitted in Switzerland, in that it is not forbidden by any legal
regulation. And as its legality is not dependent on
the consent of the person to be sterilized, the
operation may also be performed without such
consent. However, only to permit and not to
punish an action performed in the public interest
seems not to be sufficient. The protection and
preservation of the community are part of the tasks
of the Government. As it has to fight against the
spreading of dangerous infectious diseases, it has
likewise to do so against the increase of hereditary
defective offspring. The state must not only admit
operations aiming at that but has to order them in
the interest of the common weal. So Switzerland
ought to introduce a sterilization Act, as so many
other states have done, namely, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, further in the
United States Alabama, Arizona, California, Iowa,
Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North
Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota,
Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, in Canada the provinces of
Alberta and British Columbia. F. F. Tietze.

Human Fertility

Baker, M.D.—In this paper Dr. Baker points out
that Alabama, the poorest of all the American
states, has a high proportion of youthful parents
and one of the highest birth-rates in the country.
As an inevitable accompaniment of these factors
Alabama has exceedingly high maternal and foetal
mortality and stillbirth rates. Much has been done
to alleviate these conditions by measures designed
to increase maternal and child welfare, but there has
been a growing conviction among doctors and
public alike that until sound birth control methods
are made available, particularly to the poorest and
most economically depressed parents, there can be
no fundamental improvement. A small beginning
in this direction was made in Alabama in 1932
when a birth control clinic was established in
Birmingham, thanks to the generosity of a local
physician. The service has steadily increased in
scope; in 1938 the State Medical Association
passed a resolution endorsing the establishment of
birth control clinics to help the sick and needy and
by 1939 the State Health Department was backing
the project. At the time of writing clinics are
already functioning in nineteen of Alabama’s
sixty-seven counties and the work is still growing.

A practical method for testing the spermicidal
action of chemical contraceptives.—By F. V. Sander |
and Stanford D. Cramer.—The authors describe
yet another laboratory method for estimating the
spermicidal efficiency of chemical contraceptives.
The test aims at establishing the time required by
various dilutions of a preparation to immobilize
completely all sperm in a given quantity of semen.
Only 0:2 cc. semen is needed for each test ; therefore somewhere between fifteen and twenty tests
can be done with an average ejaculate. It is most
unfortunate that so many tests with various minor
differences have been and still are being devised
for the in vitro estimation of spermicidal power,
for it means that results from different countries
and different laboratories cannot be compared ;
this small but important matter needs international
discussion and standardization but this will hardly
be achieved until after the war.

Journal of Criminal Law and
Criminology

November-December 1941, Vol. 32, No. 4.—The
Baconian Lecture, University of Iowa, by Hans
von Hentig, deals with The Limits of Penal Treatment, and he refers to the overcrowding, idleness
and crimes which are committed in the penal
establishments in America. He asserts that many
convicts know that their punishment has not
ended when they obtain their release ;. they know
that, to a certain extent, each of them has received
PERIODICALS

a life sentence. He states that if we would dare to
strike some prisoner’s past completely off our
records and our memory, more reformative energies
would be unfolded than dangers set free. Discussing
the deterrent and reformative aspects of prison administration, von Hentig considers that effective
deterrence rests upon the unbroken operation of
deterrent instrumentalities, and that determent is
a limited method of controlling human behaviour
and checking human urges. He considers that
reformation demands more effort, skill and experience, and that it is more expensive in the initial
stages of treatment ; but if successfully carried out
it becomes a saving device and a most effective way
of dealing with the law-breaker.

Journal of Heredity

November 1939, Vol. 305 No. 11.—I nherited inability
to Sweat.—By L. C. Glass and D. H. Yost.—The
condition, usually called anidrotic ectodermal
dysplasia, consists in the absence of sweat glands
together with ectodermal defects of the skin, for
example absent mammary glands, spoon-shaped
nails, absence of hair, absence of tear formation
and so forth. In the family reported the condition
has been directly transmitted through three generations, though uncomplicated dominant inheritance

cannot account for some of the pedigrees described ©

in the literature.

A Study of American Rhodes Scholars.—By F. L.
Apperly.—Amongst the smaller families there is a
marked tendency for eldest born sons to be more
often represented than their younger brothers.
The author discusses this finding, but is unable to
advance any definite hypothesis.

Coincident Inheritance of Strabismus and Nystagmus.—By L. 5. West.—The pedigrees presented
and a study of the literature show that both conditions may be dominant, recessive or sex-linked, thus
indicating the action of any one of several genes.
One pedigree shows both conditions, some persons
having nystagmus only, some both abnormalities ;
it seems probable that the conjunction is not
purely fortuitous.

Objectivity of Report in Family Studies of
Heredity.—By B. S. Burks.—This is a preliminary
analysis of a large-scale investigation to determine
the reliability of questionnaire material, the traits
assessed being hair colour, eye colour, skin colour,
height and weight. Measures of resemblance
between relatives, independent gradings by different
persons and checking up by objective measurements were all used. This line of research offers
excellent possibilities not only for assessing the
errors implicit in the questionnaire method, but
also of devising improved methods for specifying
instructions,

Nomenclature of Hereditary Crooked Fingers.—
By S. E. Stoddard.—It is suggested that the term
camptodactyly should be used for flexion of the
fingers due to the nature of muscle or tendon
attachments, and that the term streblomicrodactyly should be reserved for cases in which the
little finger alone is affected. A family is described
in which this condition behaves as a simple
dominant.

December 1939, Vol. 30, No. 12.—The Inhervitayce
of “natural bangs.”—By S. E. Stoddard.—A
family is described in which a front lock of hair
grows to no greater length than five and a half
inches; the hairs are replaced when they reach
this length. The condition has been transmitted
through four generations as a dominant. Both
sexes. are affected though the condition is more
easily detected in women. Apparently no other
example of this abnormality has yet been recorded.

Predicting Adjustment in Marriage.—By E. W.
Burgess.—Previous studies are briefly summarized.
The author has found it possible to obtain as high
a corrélation as 0:56 for husbands and o*43 for
wives as a measure of the prediction value of a
scale based on a number of premarital items.
These are very similar to the correlations obtained
by Terman, 0-47 for husbands and o- 46 for wives.
These first results are thus distinctly promising.
The author discusses the individual items under
six basic headings, personality characteristics,
cultural backgrounds, socialization, economic
status, response patterns and sex desires. Lack of
self-confidence in the husband, but not in the wife,
makes for unhappiness. Self-sufficiency on the
other hand is a bad prognostic feature for both.
There appears to be no relation at all betaveen
success and “‘ sociability,’’ i.e. the extravert and
the introvert have an equal chance of happiness in
marriage. Certain personality traits have been
studied in combination. For example, the following are unfavourable combinations: where the
young woman makes friends easily and the man
does not ; where the man is troubled by feelings of
inferiority and the woman is not; also the day
dreaming young man with the non-day dreaming
young woman. Economic factors as such seem to
play little part, except as a reflection of a stabilized
and socialized personality. The only sexual items
which seem to have a definitely statistical significance are similarity in sexual desires and the

orgasm capacity of the wife.

Fertility Differentials amygong Princeton Alumnae.
—By J. J. Osborn.—The classes studied are those
of 1891, 1900, 1902, 1912, 1913 and 1921. The group
as a whole has a low fertility, below the replacement rate. It is noteworthy, however, that within
this highly selected field there is a definite association between success in life and fertility. This was
also true of fertility and scholastic achievement
36

while at college. Another interesting finding is that
fertility has increased during the period under
review.

January 1940, Vol. 31, No. 1.—IJnherited Inability
to eat Sugay.— By S. Davidenkov.—Sufferers from
this strange condition, drawn from two cousin
sibships, were unable to swallow anything sweet.
As one of them said: ‘‘ Better starve than eat a
sweet bun.’”’ Saccharin produced the same effect.
There were apparently no other abnormalities and
hospital examination of one patient did not reveal
any deviation from normal standards. A dose of
cane sugar, however, produced severe reactions
with unpleasant results of an objective as well as
subjective character. The reaction to saccharin
suggests that it is the sweet taste and not chemical
composition which is of importance. The author
thinks the evidence insufficient for supposing the
condition to be allergic. He suggests an analogy
with family myoplegia. 
Cancer of the Mammary Gland in Mice.—By L. C.
Strong.—This is not exclusively a genetic phenomenon. It is determined by an original contribution from the germ plasm but is continuously
affected by dietary factors from before birth to the
onset of the malignant change.

Coalescent twins.—By H. Black.—These Siamese
twins had two heads and four arms; fusion began
at the shoulders and they had a single torso and
two legs. Two hearts were enclosed in a single
pericardium ; there were four lungs; two stomachs, one liver; two sets of intestines merging
into a common large intestine ; four kidneys with
a common bladder. The twins lived (in Moscow)
till they were a year old. The brains and spinal
cords were separate and as the result of possessing
two central nervous systems they went to sleep
independently, had individual reactions to pain
and responded individually when called by name.
A volume is promised dealing with observations
on this remarkable pair.

Hereditary polydactyly—By R. A. Hefner.—
Long slender thumbs have been inherited as a
simple dominant condition through five generations. In some cases affected persons also exhibit
polydactyly and thumbs having three phalanges.
The polydactylous condition reappeared after a
lapse of three generations.

Note on Wood's paper on parental instinct.—By
H. W. Norton.—Wood’s paper, which has already
been abstracted in the REvIEw,* is subjected to
damaging criticism. Norton holds that Wood’s
classification was arbitrary and subjective in the
case of “ large ’’ families and fallacious in the case
of ‘‘small’’ ones. In the small families there is no
association between family size, sex, birth order
and rank and no tendency for the youngest child to
be a male.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

"February 1940, Vol. 31, No. 2.—Problems set by

clinical néuropathology to be solved by genetics.—By
S. Davidenkov.—A review of outstanding problems in human genetics with interesting references
to Russian work to be published later.

A pedigree of malformed upper extremities.—By

-K. A. Stiles and P. Dougan.—A dominant gene

transmitted through three generations has produced very variable degrees of abnormality in
different persons, ranging from crooked little
fingers with radio-ulnar synostosis to a condition
in which the arms were reduced to short fin-like
appendages with three fingers only on each hand.

Inheritance of a white forelock in a mulatto
family.—By A. M. Cromwell.—The union of a
white man with a white forehead blaze and a
mulatto woman has led to four more generations
of affected persons. Transmission is dominant
with one instance of a skipped generation.

March 1940, Vol. 31, No. 3.—A family pedigree of
appendicitis.—By M. Flavia.—An extensive family
group showing a very high incidence of the disease
and of appendicectomy. The pedigree suggests the
dominant inheritance of a strong predisposition to
the disease.

 

Mental and physical traits of identical twins
veaved apart.—By I. C. Gardner and H. H. Newman.—This is the twentieth case of Newman’s
series. These girls were separated at the age of
8 days and except for brief visits had no contact
till they entered the same University at the age of
18. Their environmental circumstances differed
in a good many respects. In physical appearance
and in mental and temperamental characteristics
they are the most similar of the whole series and
actually are more alike than the majority of identical twins reared together. Newman states that
in view of his impending retirement this may be
the last case he reports. (We sincerely hope that this
will prove not to be the case.) Particular interest
therefore attaches to his summary. He says that
the book published with his collaborators has been
commonly criticized for emphasizing environmental
factors and minimizing hereditary factors. He
disarmingly states that two of the three authors
were specialists in education and tend to be environmentalists at heart. He himself, however,
the geneticist of the team, says that he has to
confess that what chiefly impressed him throughout the studies of identical twins reared apart
were the very great intrapair similarities after
they had been exposed to all sorts of environmental differences, rather than the intrapair
differences. In only four out of twenty cases were
there striking differences exceeding those of some
identical twins reared together. Fairly large
environmental differences do modify ‘physical,
mental and temperamental traits and do produce
proportionately large differences between indiPERIODICALS

‘viduals of identical genetic constitution, but in
many cases in spite of known differences in
environment, these are not sufficient to reach the
threshold of effectiveness.

April 1940, Vol. 31, No. 4.—The Badgett quadruplets.
—By J. G. Sinclair—tThese year-old girls probably
comprise an identical pair with two unlike sisters.

May 1940, Vol. 31, No. 5.—‘' Streamlined ”’ pigs.—
By L. E. Johnson.—These legless pigs were born
alive and were apparently as healthy and vigorous
as their normal litter mates. They lived for two or
three days and then died, apparently of starvation.
Inheritance is simply recessive.

Twin and triplet birth ratios —By R. L. Jenkins
and J. Gwin.—Neglecting stillbirths, if a represents
the incidence of dizygotic twinning and 6 the
incidence of monozygotic twinning, the frequencies
(equalizing for maternal age) of triplet births are
found to be 0-656 a? for trizygotic triplets, 0-656
x 2ab for dizygotic triplets and c (= 2-83 x10°)
for monozygotic triplets. The figure 0-656
represents the in utero survival value of trizygotic
and dizygotic triplets compared with dizygotic
twins.

June 1940, Vol. 31, No. 6.—An analysis of tumours
in monozygous and dizygous twins——By M. T.
Macklin.—Seventeen cases are described in which
one or both members of twin pairs had developed
tumours. In six identical pairs both were affected
and in four identical pairs one only; in three
fraternal pairs both were affected and in five one
only. Fifty-three identical.pairs and thirty-five
fraternal pairs have been collected from the
literature. An analysis of this important material
leads to the conclusion that both members are far
more often affected in identical pairs. When both
members are affected the tumours are far more
often of the same type in the identical pairs, tend
far more often to occur in the same organ and the
age at onset shows less difference.

The effect of children on the economic status of
American families —By F. Lorimer.—The author
presents an analysis of data on the relation of
economic status to number of children under
sixteen among native-born, non-relief American
families. The data are derived from a Federal
study of consumer purchases carried out in 1935-6.
The areas investigated included Chicago, three
medium sized East North Central cities and
certain farming communities in Ohio and PennSylvania. The most striking change in proportional
expenditure was the increase in the percentage of
income spent on food as the number of children
increased from none to four, rising in Chicago from
31°3 per cent in families with no children to
38-6 per cent in families with three and four. The
farm group figures were 35-8 per cent and 42:8 per
cent respectively. Nevertheless this increase was
by no means sufficient to prevent a sharp decline
in the cost of food per head (in adult equivalent
units). In Chicago three or four child families would

 

 

 

37

e

need double the income of childless families to
maintain the same dietary standard ; in the farm
areas the increase would have to be 50 per cent.
Increase in family size did not result in increase of
expenditure on clothing and housing, which
remained at almost the same level. There is a
strong tendency for the proportion of wives gainfully employed to fall as number in the family
increases. The need for continuing the wife’s
employment owing to strong economic pressure is
held to be a major factor in deciding family
limitation. A fuller account of this work is promised in forthcoming books.

July 1940, Vol. 31, No. 7.—The alphabetical
Perricone Quadruplets—By I. C. Gardner and
H. H. Newman.—An interesting account of a set
of four boys, no two being identical.

Hereditary Epistaxis in Man.—By H. K. Fink.—
The condition has been inherited as a dominant
through six generations in the family described.
It is not Osler’s disease apparently, as telangiectases are not described. Those affected were
particularly susceptible to nasal infection.

August 1940, Vol. 31, No. 8.—A new Mutation in the
Mouse.—By L. C. Dunn; S. Gluceksohn-Shoenheimer and V. Bryson.—This simply transmitted
gene produces in the heterozygote either short
tails or taillessness, often short or crooked spinal
columns, abnormalities of the kidneys and lowered
viability after birth. The homozygotes present
many abnormalities, including taillessness, spina
bifida and absencé of kidneys, of external genitalia
and other parts of urogenital system; viability
before birth was unaffected but naturally death
occurred soon afterwards. In a certain inbred
normal stock the expression of the gene in the
heterozygote was much enhanced and viability is
now so low that the gene is practically a dominant
lethal.
Recessive Polydactylism.—By C. P. Oliver.—
Three members of a sibship born to consanguineous
parents exhibited polydactylism associated with
mental deficiency. One affected person who was
fully investigated exhibited no other anomaly
apart from a supernumerary nipple and a speech
defect. J. A. FRASER RoBERTs.

 

 

The Journal of Hygiene

September 30th, 1941, Vol. 41, No. 2.—Physical
Type in Pneumoconiosis.—By E. A. Aslett,
P. D’Arcy Hart, W. J. Martin, and W. T. Russell.—
The data of this inquiry were derived from an
anthracite colliery in Carmarthenshire, which had
a high incidence of pulmonary abnormality. The.
specific purpose of the investigators was to test
whether or not a correlation between any particular anthropometric type and susceptibility to.
pneumoconiosis could be demonstrated. After
some preliminary exploration for suitable ratios
and indices as criteria, it was decided to ascertain.

 

 
38

to what degree the anthropometry of the infected
miners could be differentiated from a normal
population on the basis of various weight, chest,
stature, etc., measurements and ratios. Before this
differentiation could be attempted, it was necessary
to restrict the sample to men who had been
equally exposed to the risk of contracting the
disease, and a period of fifteen years colliery work
was adopted as a suitable qualification.

The conclusion at which the investigators
arrived, according to their data, is that there is a
slight correlation between an anthropometric type
and susceptibility to pneumoconiosis, but it is not
possible to forecast with any degree of accuracy
that one particular examinee is more likely than
another to develop the disease.

Social Forces

October 1941, Vol. 20, No. 1.—Some aspects of
village demography.—By-T. Lynn Smith.—Smith
shows that the rural non-farm group of the U.S.A.
1930 census—persons living neither on farms nor
in incorporated communities with populations over
2,500—is not demographically identical with the
“‘ village population ’’ of the U.S.A. (apparently
defined as persons living in communities of less
than 2,500). The village has a slight deficiency of
children, a marked deficiency of young adults and
a very large excess of old people; it has a larger
proportion of females (especially adults) than
either the farm or the non-farm rural groups; and
a very large excess of widowed and divorced
females, ‘‘ probably from the surrounding farms.”

The changing pattern of destitution in urban areas.
—By J. W. Riley.—Since 1913 the New York
Times publishes annually details of the “‘ hundred
neediest cases’ in New York City, selected by
leading charity organizations. Analysis shows that
improvements in health and social services, the
falling birth rate and other factors have changed
the pattern of destitution between 1913 and 1940.
Tuberculosis was a factor in 23 per cent’of cases
in 1913-14, but only in 8 per cent in 1935-39, and
“‘ excess of children ’’ fell from 28 per cent to II per

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

cent, while old age rose from 5 per cent to 21 per
cent of cases.

Ethnic groups tn Connecticut indusiry.—By
Samuel Koenig.—British-Americans hold 33°5 per
cent of the ‘‘ executive” positions of Connecticut
industry, Jews 20:4 per cent, Irish 16-3 per cent
and Germans 12:2 per cent; but Jews are numerous only among the small concerns. Among
important concerns the proportion of Jews is “ very
insignificant,” and British-Americans predominate
in the most remunerative fields and positions.
Apart from them “ those groups which have been
here longest or have become more acculturated
have reached a higher level in the occupational
ladder’ in industry. Among foremen 32-3 per
cent are Irish, followed by British-Americans
(22-7 per cent), Italians (12-6 per cent) and
Germans (11°6 per cent). Italians form 23:6 per
cent of the total population, but 30:4 per cent of all
engaged in industry; 49-2 per cent of unskilled
workers, 33°5 per cent of the semi-skilled and 21 per
cent of the skilled workers are Italian. Among the
unskilled the next largest group are the Irish (19
per cent); among the semi-skilled, the Poles and
the Irish; among the skilled, the Irish, BritishAmericans and the Swedes. Like the Italians,
Poles, Swedes, Lithuanians and Ukrainians are
“‘ over-represented ”’ in industry; while BritishAmericans and Jews (10-9 per cent of the population but 3:8 per cent of those engaged in
industry) are ‘‘ under-represented.”’ (All figures
for 1937.)

Occupation and education in a democracy.—By
J. B. Knox.—A study of the careers, social status
and fathers’ occupations of Harvard male graduates of 1880-81, 1894-95, IQII-I2 and 1924-25.
The proportion of sons entering professions was
consistently higher than that of fathers ; business
attracted more sons of ‘higher social status ”’
than did professions ; professions received a larger
proportion of sons of “‘ low social status’’ and sent
a larger proportion of their own ‘ upper class ”
into business ; and Harvard acted as a channel of
social advancement for sons of working-class
origin, a large majority of whom entered professions,
