CORRESPONDENCE

Health of Militiamen

To the Editor, Eugenics Review

S1r,—Under this heading you published a letter
from me in your July 1939 issue, in which I referred
to Mr. Chamberlain’s statement that of the first
55,000 young men medically examined 92-2 per
cent. were found fit for military service. I examined
this statement in relation to other medical evidence
bearing on health and physique and gave grounds
for suggesting that, to put it mildly, the percentage
in question should not be accepted at its face
value. This letter and a letter published in The
Times on the same subject were followed by a
stream of what I can only describe as indignant
denials from some who were, and some who were
not, qualified to judge.

I concluded my letter by hoping that “ the
Government will reveal additional information
which may be in their possession.’’ A revelation
has now come from a quite unexpected quarter.
Recently, I turned over the leaves of ‘‘ Army
Appropriation Account, 1939, and Report of the
‘Comptroller ’’ (House of Commons Paper, 37/1941),
and came across the following :

26

‘* From papers made available to me it appears
that during the early months of the war many
men, who were accepted following a cursory
preliminary medical examination [my italics],
were later found on a more thorough examination to be unfit for military service, and were
sent to their homes to await the normal examination by a medical board before discharge. Long
periods elapsed before the men were examined
by medical boards and there were further delays
before discharges were confirmed by the appropriate authority. These delays resulted in pay
and allowances being issued for as long as three
or four months to men who apparently should not
have been accepted for service.’’ (Vote I,
Section 15).” .

I do not propose at this moment to comment on
this Report; I merely wish to place the Comptroller’s observations on record.
