Inquiry into Fertility of
Immigrants

Preliminary Report

Introduction

MMIGRATION INTO BRITAIN from Com| monvet countries, on any appreciable

scale, is a phenomenon of very recent years.
It is a result of the economic attractions of good
wages and the welfare services coupled with the
freedom of citizenship within the Commonwealth: a freedom now subject to qualifications
as a direct result of the increasing scale of
immigration. Birmingham has been a focus of
attraction because of its prosperity and the
diversity of its trades. Within Birmingham
immigrants have tended to congregate in certain
parts of the city; Sparkbrook, Soho, Balsall
Heath, Handsworth, Lozells, are all wards with
more than 5,000 immigrants. Sparkbrook ward
contains the highest total number of any ward,
and includes representative groups from several
different countries of origin. (See Table 1A).

Most immigrants are not accompanied by their
families when they first arrive. Some will send
for them later, usually when they consider they
have established themselves sufficiently securely;
others may set up permanent or semi-permanent
liaisons with members of the indigenous population or with other immigrants. In any case the
pattern of fertility they exhibit becomes a matter
both of intrinsic interest from the sociological
viewpoint and of importance in the future
provision of services of all kinds. Before it has
crystallized into a set form in the course of time

it is important to record and examine the
pattern of fertility, even though the period is one
of transition and high social mobility. It is such
transitional periods in fact which have in the
past so frequently escaped informed sociological
observation.

The present investigation was begun in March
1963, in Sparkbrook, to attempt to provide
information of this kind, and even more important, to discover to what extent such information
was obtainable, and if obtainable, reliable. The
Census of 1961 included questions on country

of birth which, although the movement of an
immigrant population is more rapid than that
of the indigenous, could be related to results
obtained in an Inquiry. The University of
Birmingham had availed itself of the offer by the
General Register Office of full census data for
each Enumeration District. The average composition of an Enumeration District is about
250 households. In Sparkbrook there were thirty
Enumeration Districts, which meant that Inquiry
results and Census data could be compared on a
finer basis than had hitherto been possible. For
this purpose the Inquiry was associated with the
West Midlands Social and Political Research
Unit, which was set up by the University of
Birmingham to administer the Census material,
and to initiate and co-ordinate research related
to it.

Like many of the areas where immigrants have
settled in this country, Sparkbrook before the
First World War was a select middle- and
professional-class residential district. Now it is
a compact working-class area which has seen
successive influxes of immigrants: the Welsh in
the 1920s, the Irish in the 1930s and the West
Indians and the Indians and Pakistanis since
the mid-1950s. Terrace and court housing has

now surrounded the large and lofty Victorian
houses, which the pressure for accommodation
has turned into one-room tenements. The Ward
itself is now almost a self-sufficient entity; it
is served by road, railway and canal communications; it is the home of several lightengineering firms and service industries, enough
to provide employment for many of its residents.
In addition to the normal amenities, there are
now to be found shops run by Moslems for their
own special requirements, a cinema showing
Indian films; and places of worship suited to the |
wider range of beliefs now represented.

Structure of Sample

Ten of the thirty Enumeration Districts were
chosen for inclusion in the sample. Although the
Census data were not available at the beginning
of the Inquiry, the definition of each Enumeration District was known. From the Electoral
Registers the proportion of electors with Asian
names was assessed for each Enumeration
District, and the ten Districts with the highest
proportions selected. Names of Irish or West
Indians were of course mostly indistinguishable
from the names of the indigenous population.

INQUIRY INTO FERTILITY OF IMMIGRANTS

1961 Census, of the immigrant population of
the ward by sex and marital status.

Here, as in Table 1A, the headings refer to the
population classified by place of birth. Children
of immigrant parents born in this country are
thus classified as born in Great Britain. In our
sample, however, we have grouped children by
the place of birth of their mother’s present
consort. We found no immigrants from Ceylon
in the districts included in our sample and we
grouped together those from India and Pakistan
to form our Indian/Pakistani group.

The different patterns of immigrant settlement
are apparent from Table 1B in the numbers of
women in the West Indian group compared with
the Indian/Pakistani. In the latter group no
woman in our sample came unless at her
husband’s request to join him. Almost the direct
opposite was the case in the West Indian group,
where the common pattern was that a woman
would come unattached and independently to
this country. While here she may cohabit with
a West Indian, usually from the same island,
hoping eventually to return home with him. On
the other hand, Indians or Pakistanis who bring
their families here have generally no intention of
returning to their own country.

The area selected is bounded on the west by
the Stratford Road, a main arterial road running
in a south-easterly direction, and by the canal
and railway line on the east, running approximately parallel. In the centre is Farm Park, a
remnant of the estate of Sampson Lloyd, one of
the founders of Lloyd’s Bank. In the south-east
corner are Barber Trust houses, which contain
no immigrant families. They have been excluded
entirely from the sample. Apart from this section,
the whole area chosen was “scanned”’: particulars were obtained of the occupants of every
dwelling. Every house in which was living an
Indian or Pakistani family was included in the
sample, and we interviewed all other families, of
whatever nationality, living in the same house.
Family, or family unit, was used as a term to
include husband, wife and children (if any), or a
woman living alone, or a man and woman
cohabiting, whether the woman had children or
not, and whether by her present consort or
another.

This method of sampling, which had the

advantage of equalizing the backgruund of living
conditions and of maximizing the numbers of
the smallest group, the Asians, yielded insufficient numbers of English families to form a
comparable group. To supplement this group,
and incidently the Irish and West Indian groups
too, we interviewed all families in every tenth
house in the streets where we had found Indian
or Pakistani families living. This included the
whole of the area we had chosen except the
south-east corner, where all the housing was that
of the Barber Trust. In this way we ensured that
all our informants lived in very similar accommodation. If a tenth house happened to be one
already included in the main sample, the house
next before it was taken.

During this time a questionnaire was being
compiled. It was tried out in a pre-pilot survey
of twenty-five households in Balsall Heath, an
adjoining ward to Sparkbrook, similar in
character. This experience showed that once
initial contact had been made, immigrants were
willing to talk about their family life both in
their country of origin and here, and about
their reasons for coming, how they had raised
the fare, etc. The first form of the questionnaire
was therefore expanded after this pre-pilot
survey, and interviewing with the new questionnaire began in Sparkbrook in May.

Two hundred and fifty-four families were
interviewed at 119 dwellings, out of a total
sample selected of 263 families. There were
seven refusals: two English, two Irish, one West
Indian, one mixed (an Irish woman, living with
a Pakistani), one Pakistani; and two noncontacts (one English and one Irish). We excluded one Polish, one Nigerian, and four Arab
families, leaving a total sample size of 248.

A written form of introduction was used,
when necessary, explaining the purpose of the
survey:

... to find out more about conditions as they are,

so that plans may be made for the future in the

redevelopment of Birmingham and by the extension of its social services.

Immigrants proved easy to interview. They
were anxious to please, and to settle down;
ambitious for their children and for themselves.
The English and the long-settled Irish were more
sure of themselves and their rights; sometimes

9
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

critical of the coloured immigrants, especially
the Indian and Pakistani group, because of
ignorance, their very different way of life, and
the language barrier. Freedman, Whelpton and
Campbell (1959) found that questions about
family planning were more readily answered
than those about income, which some informants considered to be “‘too personal’. In our
sample, we were refused details of income in
two cases, but met no refusal of information
about family planning. In four instances it was
not sought because in each of these it was not
the woman herself or her husband who was
interviewed, but in three cases her son, and in
one, a student living in the same house and of
the same nationality.

The families interviewed were classified into
four nationality groups. A general description
of the background of each group is given, and
the numbers in brackets indicate the total of
completed interviews.

ENGLISH (54): These were families who had lived
in the area since before the war, and had seen
it change in character. They were mostly older
women who had completed their families; but
there were some young couples, who were
either living with their parents or had moved
into the area temporarily until they could find
accommodation elsewhere. Many of them were
resentful of immigrants because of their different
way of life, and their effect in lowering the
social standing of the area.

IrisH (69): These fall into three sub-groups:

(i) a settled group, closely similar to the
English;

(ii) an itinerant group, travelling back and
forth between England and Ireland, according
to the labour situation, whose permanent home
was usually in Ireland and their time here only

short;

(iii) the Irish tinkers, who used to be horsedealers, leading a nomadic life in caravans; now
dealers in scrap, second-hand furniture, etc.;
still nomadic, and very different in way of life
from their respectable long-settled compatriots;
stricter Catholics and regular church-goers,
adhering to the teachings of the Church on
birth control.

West INDIAN (56): This group lived an easygoing, loose-knit family life, in which marriage
was neither socially nor economically necessary.
English was their native language, and Christianity, in various forms, their religion. They
settled down easily and were on the whole well
tolerated by their English neighbours; it was
the hope of most of them sooner or later to

Io

return to the West Indies. Men and women
came singly, met here and cohabited or married
here. We found no example of a couple arriving
together who were married before they came to
this country.

INDIAN/PAKISTANI (69): Although by no means a
homogeneous group they were distinct and
separate from the others because of several
predominant factors. Their skin was a different
colour; their languages different, few knowing
much English; and their beliefs and way of life
were very different. Many seemed to have no
wish to be assimilated, and had come, for the
most part, by means of an organized network
of family and village connections. The first
immigrants in this group were mostly seamen,
either deserting ship at a British port, or getting
their discharge papers in a Commonwealth
country. Once settled they sent for their families
to join them. Recently, others had come not
directly from India, but from East Africa—
Kenya and Tanganyika mainly—where for a
long time there has been an Indian population,
chiefly small businessmen and civil servants.
The spread of nationalism in Africa had put
their position in jeopardy and they have chosen
to come to England. They came with the
advantage of a knowledge both of the English
language and the English way of life, making it
an easier matter for them to settle in England
than for their countrymen coming from a rural
and traditional life at home. Of the whole group,
we found that a majority had come from either
the Mirapur area, in Northern Pakistan, or
from the Punjab region of India and Pakistan.

Interviewing

With few exceptions the interview took place
with the mother in each family unit. The exceptions occurred among the Indian/Pakistani
group where the mother spoke no English: in
some cases the interview was with the father,
alone or in the presence of his wife, and often
senior members of the family too. _

The attitude towards family planning showed
interesting differences between the groups.
Among the English and the Irish, the decision
to try to plan or to limit the family was a joint
one. In the West Indian group it was the concern of the woman: few women in this group
marry or even have the advantages of a stable
union until after the birth of several children. If
a West Indian woman eventually marries she
will often have had children by other men than
her husband, though he will accept them all as
his family. Among the Indians and Pakistanis,
INQUIRY INTO FERTILITY OF IMMIGRANTS

the mother’s role is still governed by tradition:
her husband is responsible for her and for her
behaviour; she is a reflection of her husband,
and her views are his. Only slowly does this
seem to be changing, and any decision to allow
his wife more freedom in this country than she
is accustomed to at home, is the husband’s.

All the questions, except certain of those
relating to family planning, were factual, and
internal checks of various kinds were included.
To some, however, it was impossible to get
accurate answers. For example, several Indian
and Pakistani families had no record of the
birth dates of their children who were born
before they came to this country. Their way of
life at home had not demanded registration or
the exact remembrance of such events. Different
cultural, economic and social patterns in the
immigrants’ home countries made it sometimes
difficult directly to compare the experiences and
practices of different groups before they came to
England.

Results

The composition of the sample is shown in
Table 2. Throughout the sample, the woman
was grouped according to her husband’s nationality or if she were unmarried, according to her
own. Mixed unions, whether by marriage or
co-habitation, were all formed by white women
with Indian, Pakistani, or West Indian men.
We found no example of the reciprocal.

In many respects it was more meaningful to
subdivide the Indian/Pakistani group on the
basis of religious practice into Moslems, Hindus,
Sikhs, and a Mixed group. The composition of
the Mixed group is as follows:

One English wife married to a Hindu born in
England.
One English woman married to an AngloPakistani from whom she is now separated.
Three married English women, separated from
their husbands, living with Hindus.
_. Three single English women living with Moslems.

Three Irish wives married to Moslems.

One Irish widow living for the past fourteen years

with a Moslem whose own wife is in Pakistan.

One German wife married to a Moslem.

The four nationality groups are close to
equality in size: the optimum ratio for purposes
of comparison. The third column of Table 2
shows the percentage of women ever marrying
to be high, as would be expected from the
method of selecting the sample, except in the
West Indian group, where a different custom
prevails. The column showing women ever
pregnant thus gives a better basis for comparison
between the groups. The figures in the last
column are affected by extraneous factors in the
case of the two latter groups. The marriage
customs among the West Indian group are such
that only a small proportion of mothers (1 in
5) are represented here (see for instance Blake,
1961); a figure based on duration of cohabitation before the birth of the first child would be
more properly comparable, but the data necessary are not in every case available. Among the
Indian/Pakistani group, both the custom of
child marriage and often the long separation of
the wife from her husband before she joins him
in this country, contribute to an extended
interval between marriage and the birth of the
first child. The same disparity of custom recurs
at a later stage in our analysis and is examined
more closely in Tables 6 and 7. By examining
the percentages of women married by a given

age, as in Table 3, the differences between the
groups are revealed more clearly.

From Table 4 the average age of the English
women is seen to be ten years greater than that
of women in the other groups. This difference is
a reflection of the stable and long settlement
pattern of the English in the area, many of whom
lived and brought up their families there before
the war. Immigrants tend always to be the
younger, more mobile members of a community.

This, and the differences in pregnancy and
marriage patterns, are all apparent from
Table 4.

Table 5 clarifies the differences between
columns 2 and 3 of Table 4, revealing the never
pregnant group to be a combination of young
and of older women, some who have not yet
begun their families, and others classifiable as
infertile. In most of what follows we shall be
concerned only with the fertile group.

tive throughout a nationality group. It is
interesting to note the reversal in the ratio of
English to Irish in Table 8: Irish women seem

to attempt legitimization more frequently than
the English. All women in the Indian/Pakistani
group who conceived a child before marriage
were from the Mixed group, and none of them
was herself of Indian or Pakistani birth.

In the first four columns of Table 8 the comparisons between “All women” and ‘Women
ever pregnant” are affected by the different
stages reached by family units at the time of
sampling: this is most obvious in the Irish group
with its larger number of women not yet
pregnant. The English group, despite its higher
average age, has the smallest family size;
allowance for age differentials might have
accentuated the differences between the groups,
but we discuss later our reasons for preferring
direct comparisons. The difference between
pregnancies and live-births, chiefly miscarriages
but a few stillbirths, is examined more closely
in this and subsequent tables.

Among the Irish women in our sample fewer
pregnancies result in live births than in any other
group, a difference which is more marked when
related to mothers, as shown in the last column
of Table 8. From Table 9 it is clear that some of
the Irish women repeatedly miscarry, and that
the total of miscarriages in the Irish group is
more than double that in any other group.

*There were three further birth ranks in the Irish group, with average ages of 36-3, 36-5 and 34. “ce Note, Table 11).

Table 10 shows the pattern of fertility by age
of mother for each nationality group. Throughout this table and the next, ages are given in
years and decimals of a year. On average the
Indian/Pakistani woman has her family earliest,
and the English woman latest. Variations in
higher birth ranks are due mainly to the small
numbers of families on which the figures are
based.

The graph (Figure 1) partially compensates
for small numbers and the varying stages of
development of individual families by exhibiting
the cumulative pattern of fertility by age of
woman, for each group. In this way each pregnancy can contribute to the whole picture; each
woman is included up to her age at the time of

interview: thereafter both she and her whole
family are excluded from the computation. The
Indian/Pakistani group shows the steepest rise,
followed closely by the Irish, who, in our
sample, continue to the highest total number of
pregnancies. The English and the West Indian
patterns are similar in shape up to age fortyfive, though separated by approximately one
pregnancy in total number. Comparisons of the
upper sections of the curves are unreliable,
being subject to relatively large sampling fluctuations because of the diminishing numbers of
families contributing information.

Because the English group is older than the
others, it is a possible hypothesis that some of
the differences in Table 10 are due to a changing
pattern of childbearing, both by age and
number, observed at different stages of its
evolution. For this reason a similar table (Table
11) was compiled for women none of whom was
above age twenty-five at the time of sampling.

NOTE: Figures in brackets refer to the numbers of
women ever pregnant, but not more than age 25 at

In both Tables 10 and 11, if only one family is represented the figure is in italics.

Any secular changes in reproductive patterns
might thereby introduce less distortion. Inspection of this Table seems to justify the hypothesis,
certainly in respect of earlier childbearing.

In Table 12 we have examined the ages at
death of children up to fifteen by nationality
group. Clearly these tables are biassed by the
INQUIRY INTO FERTILITY OF IMMIGRANTS

inclusion of families in all stages of development, and in particular by differences in this
respect between the groups, a fact which is
demonstrated in the last column of Table 12A.
The Indian/Pakistani group which showed a
low rate of miscarriage shows here the highest
number of children dying. Excluding the deaths
of older children (over the age of five) there are
still nearly three times the number of deaths in
this group compared with the others. On closer
examination in Table 12B, it is seen that their
deaths are divided almost equally into the three
groups of under one month, the remainder of
the first year, and the subsequent four years.

Infant mortality rates, shown in Table 12C,
which were obtained by relating the above
figures to our totals of livebirths, are not inconsistent with rates recently current in the countries
of origin of our immigrant groups, or with those
of eleven years earlier in the case of the English

group. The fact that the majority of these infant
deaths occurred in the country of origin sup

ports this comparison. Neonatal mortality rates,
calculated in a similar way though with still
smaller numbers, are rather less divergent than
rates for the whole of the first year of life. This
finding, too, is consistent with expectation,
because the wider divergence in rates of total
infant mortality will be attributable largely to the
differential effects, between groups, of malnutrition and infections in the post-neonatal
period. It is open to doubt, however, whether
the low miscarriage rate we found in the Indian/
Pakistani group is a true picture, or whether for
some reason it is due to under-representation.

Family Planning Information

Of all the information we obtained, only a
proportion of that concerning family planning
represented opinion rather than fact. The first
three columns of Table 13 are based on this
material. The third column refers only to
women potentially capable of childbirth. It is
interesting to note that the English show here
the lowest percentage. We based our assessment
of knowledge of family planning on answers to
the question “Many people do something to
limit the size of their families and to control
when their children come. Do you know about
family planning?” (cf. Freedman, Whelpton and
Campbell, 1959; Rowntree and Pierce, 1961).

THE

Informants whose answer to this question was
affirmative—these we have classified as “‘Users”
in this and subsequent Tables—were asked
further questions about their use of methods of
contraception (See Appendix). Not unexpectedly
the Indian/Pakistani group were least informed
about family planning, yet even two out of three
seems a remarkably high proportion for a group
largely uneducated and coming chiefly from
rural areas of India and Pakistan. In fact, they
show the highest proportion of users among
those who have knowledge of family planning.
The last four columns of this table show the
smaller family size (though many families may
yet be incomplete) and the younger age, of users
of family planning in contrast to non-users.

the use of the sheath in the second. All methods
which had at any time been used by a family
unit are included in this Table, so that the totals
of methods used exceed the numbers of users in
each group. The number ever making use of the
cap, the next most common method, is not
representative of its continued use. We found,
in fact, that many of those fitted rarely used it
again. Half those using the safe period are Irish
women: this method is of course permitted by
the Roman Catholic Church. Sterilization is
officially encouraged in India and Pakistan, and
men who already possess three children can
receive a small payment for submitting to a
minor operation. Of the five sterilizations in
Table 14, however, only one was in a male. In

NOTE:

1. Figures in brackets show number of families practising family planning.
2. Informants were asked also about ‘“‘the pill’’, the douche and the ring. None of these was used at any time by

any of the women.

Table 14 shows clearly the popularity of the
sheath as a method of contraception and next
to it, coitus interruptus. These two together
account for more than half of all the methods
used. There is an interesting reversal in the use
of these methods between the English and Irish
groups on one hand, and the West Indian and
Indian/Pakistani group on the other: coitus
interruptus is more popular in the first case, and

the course of the interviewing considerable
interest was shown in the use of oral contraceptives, which would probably become very
popular. Many of those who found their present
attempts at family limitation unsatisfactory
were anxious to find out more about these and
other methods of family planning.

our informants for not using methods of family

planning. We have included in the first column of
this Table, for the sake of completeness, those
without knowledge of family planning. Of the
whole sample, one English informant and three
Indian/Pakistani informants were not asked the
questions on family planning, because in none of
these cases was the woman herself or her
husband interviewed. (See p. 10). Apart from
those, chiefly Irish, whose religious beliefs were
opposed to family planning, it is interesting that
the commonest reason given by both European
groups was the desire to have more children.

No evidence of procured illegal abortion was
obtained from the informants in our sample.
Three pregnancies (one English, one Irish and
one West Indian) were terminated, however, for
medical reasons (See Table 8). All data included
in the Tables relate of course to the condition of
the informants at the time of interview. This
applies in particular to descriptions such as
“Women ever pregnant’, or “‘Women ever
marrying”, because our inquiry represents a
snapshot picture of what is essentially a dynamic
process.

Conclusions

Even in the preliminary analysis presented here,
the results of this survey show differences
between the nationality groups in respect of
fertility, and important differences in the reproductive experience of women from different
culture groups. Some of these differences may,
it is true, be artefacts due to the differential
effects of secular changes in the pattern of childbearing or marriage. We know such changes are
taking place to-day in our own country, and it
would not be unreasonable to expect that settlement in a foreign country could affect even
well-established patterns of reproduction. Our
data cannot decide the matter, but appear to
support the view that both effects are present,
and that secular change has not yet suppressed
cultural or national differences.

Our attention in this paper has been focused
upon the fertility experience of immigrants in
comparison with each other, and with the
indigenous population of the same area. We
have not yet been able to obtain in full the
detailed analyses of the Census particulars by
enumeration district, and to relate them to our

findings, though this will soon be possible. In
addition to the data relating to the Census, our
questionnaire includes sections of economic,
educational, and sociological relevance, little of
which has yet been analyzed. Some of this
information may serve to eludicate certain
aspects of the differences in fertility.

It is no unusual finding, particularly in a
survey which breaks much new ground, that in
attempting to obtain answers to certain questions
a host of further problems is uncovered. This
has been true in the present investigation. In
many sections, we have had to make inferences
which are tentative because the evidence, while
strongly indicative, will not support the full
weight of argument. Often the standard methods
of fertility analysis have seemed inadequate to
comprehend the complexities confronting us in
this inquiry, particularly when attempting to
compare patterns of fertility among people from
widely different cultures. Moreover, geographical separation of husband and wife has
often interrupted the immigrant’s reproductive
lifetime; some of their children have been born
at home, some here, in a very different environment, both culturally and materially, and we
have felt a need for indices or methods better
adapted to such circumstances.

From the outset, however, this inquiry was
designed as a pilot investigation, to blaze the
trail for one on a larger scale. It is in the sphere of
methodology therefore that we should look for
its chief contribution. The outline has now been
sketched and much of the general shape of the
picture is now clear. For finer detail, particularly at points which the present Inquiry has
shown to be of importance, a large-scale investigation must be undertaken. But the present
Inquiry has served a useful and a valuable
purpose as a forerunner.

It has shown first that such a survey is possible
and presents no intractable features. It has
shown that a questionnaire if it is carefully
thought out and well designed can be used to
elicit information on matters of an intimate
kind, of a kind indeed often regarded as taboo,
and that with perhaps minor reservations only,
it can be applied with equal facility and efficacy
to a variety of nationality groups. Integral to
the questionnaire of course, and of central

"17
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

importance, is the structure of the interview and
the personality of the interviewer. The interviewer
must be of a patently sympathetic nature, and
must establish a relationship of frankness,
confidence and trust. Once achieved, the barriers
are down, and taboo is no longer taboo (Norris,
1955). The subject of the latter part of the interview, present so often in the forefront of the
mind of the harassed housewife and mother, is
itself then an aid rather than a hindrance.
Together with the information, hesitantly sought
but readily proffered, on methods of family
planning, it often led to an almost cathartic
outpouring.

One of the important consequences of this
investigation has been to reveal the demand, and
the need, for a family planning service in this
district. There is every reason to hope that in the
near future a clinic will in fact be set up, in the
centre of the area which has been the subject of
this survey. It is unlikely that Sparkbrook is
exceptional in this respect, so that we may infer
that the need exists in many similar areas of
immigrant settlement. Our experience suggests
that given suitable initial publicity family planning centres set up in such areas would be
readily accepted and well patronized.

Acknowledgements

We should like to acknowledge with gratitude
a grant received through the agency of Dr. G. C.
L. Bertram. Many people have given us both
help and encouragement in all the stages of this
Inquiry, and to all of them we should like to
express our thanks. In particular we are grateful
to Professor P. Sargant Florence, Professor F.
Lafitte and Dr. D. E. C. Eversley for their
constant interest, to Mrs. Valerie Jackson of the
West Midlands Social & Political Research Unit
for analyzing the Census data referring to Sparkbrook, and to Dr. F. S. Hashmi who, with the
permission of Professor W. H. : Trethowan,
helped as an interpreter in interviewing among
those Indian and Pakistani families having little
English, and generally in elucidating many

18

aspects of their home environment. Finally we
are indebted to all those families whom we
interviewed for their ready co-operation and
friendly response.
