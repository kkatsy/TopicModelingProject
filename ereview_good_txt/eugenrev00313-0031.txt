A BRILLIANT FAMILY

And an Interesting Link with Oliver Cromwell

By W. T. J. GUN, F.R.Hist.S., F.S.G.

Historiographer to the Foreign Office

and author of Twelve Days, the standard work in this country on the events
immediately preceding the War, was one of
a remarkable and most versatile family
group, to which attention was called in The
Times obituary last September. It may be
worth while to trace back further the family
history, which in one line at least presents
features of quite unusual interest. The line
in question is as follows:

F | ‘HE late Sir James Headlam-Morley,

cousin of his wife; he later rose to be
Chief Justice under the Commonwealth.

Richard Bentley was the famous scholar
and Master of Trinity; with his daughter
Johanna all the young men of Cambridge
were said to have been in love. Denison
Cumberland, who ultimately won the prize,
was the grandson of another notable
scholar, Richard Cumberland, Bishop of
Peterborough. The younger Richard Cumberland of the pedigree was very well known
in his day as a dramatist.

Of the above ancestors, direct and collateral,
Elizabeth Cromwell was on very intimate
terms with her cousin Oliver ; for her judgment he had a high regard, evidenced by a
striking letter which he wrote to her just
before the Civil Wars. Oliver St. John
appeared in the famous Ship Money case as
counsel for John Hampden, also a first

Coming down to recent times, four of the
sons of Archdeacon John Headlam and
Maria Morley became wranglers, the eldest,
Thomas Emerson Headlam, being ultimately Judge Advocate-General. While this
generation was so purely mathematical, the
next, curiously enough, was mainly classical
in its attainments, at least four of the Arch

lam, author and cricketer, and the late
Walter Headlam, well known alike as a
scholar and a poet.

Many different influences were, of course,
responsible for this remarkable group, and
the interest of the connection with the
Cromwell family is no doubt mainly genealogical, The direct descent, however, from
the scholars Richard Bentley and the elder
Richard Cumberland cannot be altogether
without biological significance.

THE BARCLAY CONNECTION

My attention has recently been drawn to
the fact that it does not appear that a
daughter of David Barclay, son of Robert
Barclay the Apologist, married Thomas
Plumpstead, as stated in my chart published
in the EuGENIcS REVIEw of July, 1925. On
further investigation I have ascertained that
Thomas Plumpstead’s wife was the daughter
of one John Freame, and consequently the
Lloyd and Wordsworth families are not, as
stated, descended from Robert Barclay.

It is a remarkable and interesting fact,
however, that all the principal families set
out in the chart, the Galtons, Wakefields,
Gurneys, Buxtons, Hoares, Lloyds, and
Wordsworths, remain related, and the
general eugenic value of the chart remains
therefore unaltered. This arises from the
fact that Mrs. Thomas Plumpstead’s sister

Priscilla married the above David Barclay.
The accompanying abbreviated chart will
make the position clear.

The chart as revised should be called
the Freame connection.

The founder, John Freame, though not so
well known a figure as Robert Barclay of
Ury, was nevertheless a man of mark in his
day: originally a goldsmith, he developed
into a banker, and was the real founder of
Barclays Bank, afterwards carried on by the
descendants of his daughter Priscilla.

I may take this occasion of adding to the
chart three further names of interest, descendants both of Robert Barclay and of John
Freame: Sir Maurice de Bunsen, late
Ambassador at Vienna, through the Gurneys; Lord Tyrell, now Ambassador at
Paris, through the Wakefields; and the
Rev. H. B. Chapman of the Savoy Chapel,
also through the Wakefields.
