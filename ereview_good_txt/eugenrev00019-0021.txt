A Note on Recent Age-Pyramids in

Underdeveloped Countries

COMFORTABLE DOCTRINE NOW accepted by those concerned with aid to
underdeveloped countries is that once

higher standards of living are raised, birth rates
will fall, so to speak, automatically without
worrying about measures of birth control. In the
words of a letter from the Warden of Toynbee
Hall to The Times, May 2nd, 1964: “One certain
way to bring about a fall in the birth rate is by a
rapid rise in living standards.” This doctrine is
based not on actual experience in the underdeveloped countries but mainly on a doubtful
analogy with the very different conditions prevailing in England and Western Europe in the
nineteenth century. I do not wish to dispute here
whether, without birth control, higher standards
can ever be reached or whether, if so, sociological
“motivations” will really overcome ignorance
and carelessness. This note is written to draw
attention to a much more concrete factor—
demographic not psychological—which is about
to create a second-wave population explosion,
higher standards or not. This factor is the
“bulge” in the underdeveloped countries’ population under ten years old.

I must admit to not realizing the extent of this
bulge, far exceeding our own teen-ager bulge now
approaching the Universities, till, in writing a
book on visual aids, I put the Pakistan age
pyramid on to paper. To accommodate its
astonishing number of under-tens I had, in fact,
to gum on extra bits of paper to my original
lay-out. Figure 1 is the pyramid in question.

To be fair, this age pyramid should be compared not to the English pyramid of to-day, in
spite of our rising birth rate, but to that of 1871,
the Census year around which English birth
rates were at their peak. Incidentally, those who

have faith in European analogies should note
that it took a full hundred years of industrialization to reduce the English birth rate at all.
The English age pyramid for 1871, shown
below as Figure 2, has a smooth pyramidical
shape with no sudden bulge at ages 0-9. No age
group younger than fifty-five was 20 per cent
more numerous than the next oldest age group.
But in Pakistan in 1961, the group aged 5-9 was
over 70 per cent more numerous than the group
aged 10-14 and the “‘double” group aged 0-9,
100 per cent more numerous than the double

group aged 10-19. The analogy, so comfortably
drawn, between a possible automatic birth rate
fall in underdeyeloped countries, and the actual
fall after 1871 in England is obviously built up
somewhat artificially on a very different age
structure. .

Is this Pakistan pyramid typical, however, of
underdeveloped countries generally ? To test this,
I referred to all large underdeveloped countries
with a population over twenty-five million whose
age distributions for 1960 or later are published
in the U.N. Demographic Yearbook for 1963.
Besides Pakistan, they comprise Indonesia, the
Philippines, Thailand and Mexico.

The age pyramids for these four countries
given below as Figures 3 to 6 show the same
general form as that for Pakistan. A short test of
this similarity is to divide the number of 0-9year-olds by the number in the ten-year group
central to the “‘parent” generation—i.e. the
group aged of 25-34.* This inter-generation, or
‘quarter-century on,” ratio was for Pakistan
2:47. The under-ten-year-olds were about twoand-a-half times the number of twenty-five to
thirty-five-year-olds. For Mexico in 1960 the
ratio was 2-43, for both Thailand and Indonesia

*Some countries, for instance Indonesia, do not
separate persons aged twenty-five to twenty-nine or give
data for those aged twenty to twenty-nine; hence the
greater convenience of the age groups twenty-five to
thirty-four as a datum line.

in 1961 it was 2:15 and for the Philippines 2-60.
For England and Wales in 1871 it was only 1-73,
in 1961, only 1-22.

The pyramids differ in certain respects:
Indonesia, for instance, has a particularly ragged
outline in its “middle ages.” But the pyramids of
all the five underdeveloped countries agree in
showing the bulging basement.

The implications of this vast bottom bulge, if I
may use that expression, to future population
hardly need stressing. When the 1960 0-9-yearolds become 15-24-year-olds, as they will begin
to do in 1966, we may expect a really sharp
increase in gross birth rates. Hitherto, the population explosion has not (taking underdeveloped
countries as a whole) been due to a rise in birth
rates. It has been the result of a steep fall in
death rates, particularly infant mortality—a
degree of fall with no precedent in the supposed
European analogy. Now, however, we shall have
to reckon both with a fall in gross death rates,
due to a still improving death control and to the
younger age structure of the population, AND
with a rise in gross birth rates.
