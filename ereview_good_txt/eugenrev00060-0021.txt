INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS AND
DIFFERENTIAL FERTILITY—Some Observations
from Winchester College’

By KENNETH HUTTON, M.A., D.Phil.

Introduction

FEEL very honoured at being asked to
| ss a paper to the Eugenics Society,

and I hasten to assure you that I have no
qualifications in psychology, sociology, medicine or statistics ; I am, in fact, a research
chemist who became a schoolmaster and
who was struck by the intellectual abilities
of his pupils. After I had been measuring
those abilities by means of group intelligence
tests for over six years, our secretary, Dr.
Carter, suggested that the measurements
would throw some light on the differential
birth-rate, and your Society kindly provided
secretarial and financial assistance for a
related inquiry into the number of children
of old boys ; I should like here to express
my gratitude to Dr. Carter, to Miss Schenk
and to the Soczety, and also to my Headmaster, Dr. W. F. Oakeshott, for his permission to publish this paper and for his
consistent encouragement of my efforts.

The importance of the inquiry is this:

It appears probable that the intelligence
of the nation is declining, but there is little
or no direct evidence in this country of how
many children people of high intelligence
have. In America, it has been found that
both Princeton graduates and Terman’s
group of 1,000 specially gifted children have
many fewer offspring than are needed for
replacement. (I, 9) Here, in ex-pupils of
Winchester College I have a sample of high
intelligence and I have found out how many
children they have.

Outline of the Study

I shall first present the evidence for the
intelligence quotients of boys at Winchester
College, comparing the figures with those of
other schools and with those of the population as a whole, thus showing that Wyke

Soctety on November 18th, 1952.

hamists are worthy of the attention of the
eugenist.

Secondly, indications that the Wykehamists of thirty to forty years ago, who have
now become parents, were of similar intellectual calibre to the boys of today.

Thirdly, evidence that the intelligence
quotient of a boy measures something which
is fairly constant, and which is closely
related to his future academic progress.

Fourthly, the correlation of intelligence
quotients with the number of brothers and
sisters, showing that within this group there
is no evidence of a differential birth-rate for
intelligence.

Fifthly, a description of the environment
of Wykehamists ; their parental occupations,
their future occupations, and the methods
by which they are selected for entry to the
school. One-seventh of the school are “ scholars’; the remainder are ‘‘ commoners.’

Sixthly, the results of the inquiry into
the number of children of Old Wykehamists,
the proportion of bachelors, and the average
age of marriage. This is, of course, the most
important section: the point of the earlier
sections is to merely show the nature of the
sample of the population chosen for this
inquiry.

Finally, a short discussion of the signifi- .
cance of the results, showing how far this
sample of high intelligence is succeeding in
replacing itself. |

I should like to emphasize here that the
results of the intelligence tests for any
individual are confidential and are available
only to masters, not to other boys ; the replies
to the inquiry into family size have been
disclosed to no one.

N.B.—Grammar School and Direct Grant School Pupils used a different Moray House Test or Tests at a different

age.

40 per cent (including almost all the scholars)
are in the top I per cent.

Firstly : (a) In 1949, after three years of
tésting at various levels, I was able to test all
boys in their first year after entering the
school at age 134, and—through the kindness
of Professor Godfrey Thomson and Mr. W. G.
Emmett—to use their Moray House Test
“ Adult 1.” This contains 100 items to be
done in forty-five minutes, and spread the
boys out fairly satisfactorily, although two
boys got 98 per cent and 97 per cent respectively ; its great advantage is that it has been
thoroughly standardized on over 4,000 children between the ages of 14 and 15. The
results are as shown in Table I.

Of course the grammar schools were
tested at the age of about eleven, using
different Moray House Tests, and so the
comparisons are not entirely accurate or
fair (in particular it is almost impossible to
get an I.Q. of over 135 unless you are under
eleven at the date of the test). Yet the results
do show (a) that Winchester has a very high
proportion of boys of high I.Q.; (6) that in
spite of a longer “ tail ’’ than some county
grammar schools, all are in the top 50 per.
cent of the population. This point is made
clearer in fig. 1.

useful at Winchester (except for external
comparisons) are Cattell’s Scale III, designed

children and also their standard deviation is
much greater (about twenty-five to thirty
points) so that “ Cattell I.Q.s” are widely
different from those normally understood.

Fortunately the headmaster of a Home
Counties grammar school was kind enough
to arrange a direct comparison with a

Nore.—Cattell I1.Q. 200 (which is off the scale of norms provided in 1935) represents a score of 112 marks on Scale IIIa at age 130, or a score
of 119 at age 14°0.

Here again it seems fairly certain that not
more than I per cent of boys at Winchester
College are below the median of the population, and that exeedingly few scholars are
not in the top 1 per cent of the population
(above Cattell I.0.160 or 170).

The direct comparison with the other two
schools is shown more clearly in figs. 2 and 3.

once again that all boys are in the top
50 per cent of the population, and that
half of them are in the top 5 per cent.

To summarize this section, four different
types of intelligence test—including one
non-verbal, one with time virtually unlimited
and an individual test—have shown that,
eugenically speaking, boys of Winchester
College are desirable parents, if the ability
to do well at intelligence tests is desirable,
and if this ability is inheritable.

2.—The Constancy of the Intelligence of
the Wykehamical Population

This is the least satisfactory section of my
paper because of the difficulty of obtaining
adequate evidence. But unless I can make
it seem probable that Wykehamists of the
1916 vintage were also in the most intelligent
half of the population, then the number of
children they have produced is irrelevant,
and we must wait thirty years until the
present generation of Wykehamists have
completed their families. .

Intelligence Tests used at Winchester in
1933 by the National Institute of Industrial
Psychology show that twenty years ago—
as today—practically all boys do better
than 50 per cent of the whole population
(fig. 4). Group Test 35 was used on the
whole school, and such results as survive
show that Winchester was at least as good
as Eton, Marlborough and Harrow, and
noticeably better at the bottom end of the
scale. It is unfortunately impossible to
compare directly results today with those
of twenty years ago because the N.I.I.P.
consider that chance variations would far
outweigh any real alteration. However, it
seems fairly certain that no substantial
change has occurred.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Personal testimony of colleagues who
were in the school thirty years ago and who
are now teaching at Winchester more or less
confirms this idea; anyone who knows
Winchester will be impressed by the lack of
change which takes place in such a short
period as thirty or forty years. And as for the intellectual ability of scholars past and
present, it would indeed be rash of me to
assert that a list which includes Professors
Champernowne, Colin Clark, De Selincourt,
Duff, C. F. C. Hawkes, H. H. Price and
Roughton, Bodley’s Librarian and the
Warden of All Souls, was in any way inferior
to the products of the present day.

I think that we must assume that the
quality of the population of Winchester
College has been pretty well constant over
the last thirty or forty years.

3.—Thee Significance of Intelligence Quotients
_In spite of scepticism among some parents
and teachers, I think it well established that
the I.Q. is fairly constant and decidedly
useful (I exclude such phenomena as “I.Q.s”’
after “ coaching’’(10)). Some of my results
are as follows :
(a) Effect of Re-test. 234 boys were tested
in 1950-52 on Cattell Test IIIA at age 134
and then tested four months later on Cattell.

Test. {IIs ; exactly 50 per cent had an I.Q.
within ten points of the first score. This is an
encouraging result, seeing that the boys had
no incentive other than curiosity for trying
hard on either occasion. The Cattell I.Q. is
therefore a figure with some constancy.

(b) Rate of Promotion. The progress up the
school of seventy-seven boys was related to
their Cattell I.0. At Winchester there are ten
different levels, and a boy may be promoted
at the end of every term. Boys with Cattell
1.Q. less than 119 normally achieved one promotion per year, reaching level 5 from the
bottom by the age of 17; boys with Cattell
1.Q. from 120-149 achieved promotion on
the average every other term, and reached
level 7 by the age of 17; boys with Cattell

    
 

 

209

virtually essential for academic success, and
personal observation confirms Terman’s detailed study(9) that boys of high I.Q. have
at least as good characters as the less
intelligent.

4.—Correlation of Intelligence Quotient with
number of Siblings

In July 1951, after sixty-four groups of
boys had been tested in five years, the I.0.s
were known of 511 out of 516 boys then in
the school. In all but two of these groups
boys had been asked to write down the
number of brothers and sisters they had—
a request always provoking a laugh. The
results for 485 boys (including sixty-three
scholars) are shown in Table IV:

I.Q.s of 180 or over were normally promoted
every term and reached level 10 (the top)
by the age of 17. In this free-for-all competition, I.Q. is evidently an important factor—
though there are cases of boys with I.Q. 130
doing as well as I.Q. 180 until they reached
the top, when they were plainly unable to
do more than just memorize difficult work.

(c) Winning of University Scholarships.
My ex-colleague Professor Eric Lucas tested
boys in the top form with Cattell Test IIIa
at the age of 17-18 when it is impossible to
show a Cattell I.Q. above about 180. Out
of 118 boys winning University Scholarships
or Exhibitions at Oxford or Cambridge in the
seven years 1939-46, eighty-seven had been
tested, and seventy-five of these had I.Q.s
over Cattell 160—the remainder being little
short of this. Evidently a Cattell 1.0. of
160 or more (probably 170 or more when
tested at age 13) is necessary in order to have
a good chance of winning a University
award, though naturally many other things
—including the desire to win one—are
equally important.

To conclude this section I think that one
can say with confidence that a high I.Q. is

D

 

         

The average family size is 2:65 (2°59 for
scholars, 2-66 for commoners) ; but, of course,
by taking family size from the children no
account is taken of childless parents.

The correlation coefficient between intelligence quotient and number in the family is
r=—0:05 with a probable error of + 0-03,
ie. there is no significant correlation. I
must thank my colleague Mr. T. A. Jones
for checking the calculation. For the
scholars taken separately r= —0o-04 +0-08.

For a further eighty boys, not included in
the above, r= —0-:07+0-07, i.e. again not
significant, thus confirming the first result.

This result contrasts with that normally
found for unselected groups; e.g. FraserRoberts (1937) for the city of Bath(2) found
r= —0-224 ; and the 1947 survey of all the
70,000 11-year-old children in Scotland(3)
also found that there was a highly significant tendency, r= —o-28, for the children
of larger families to have lower intelligence
quotients.

It might be thought that in this very
homogeneous social group, all in the highincome range, there should be little or no
adverse environmental effect of large
2i0

numbers of brothers and sisters on a child’s
performance in an intelligence test ; whereas
when income is less such effects might be
partly responsible for the lower scores of the
children in large families.

But it has been pointed out by Maxwell
(1951)(4) that it is not possible to draw any
general conclusions about a differential birthrate for intelligence from a group which has
already been highly selected for intelligence.
For such selected groups there usually
appears to be no significant correlation, e.g.
women student teachers in Edinburgh(4),
Manchester University students(5) and
Swedish pupils taking the matriculation
exam. (6).

To conclude this section, it is important for
my own immediate purpose to establish that
within the group of boys at Winchester
College there is no evidence of a differential
birth-rate for intelligence.

5.—The Social Status of Wykehamists

It may now well be asked, ‘‘ What is the
particular social group which sends its
children to Winchester ?’’ To answer this
we shall examine the methods of selection of
the boys, their parents’ occupations, and
the future occupations of the boys.

Winchester College is an independent boys’
boarding secondary grammar school, founded

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

by William of Wykeham in 1394 for seventy
scholars, and now having 450 commoners
also, making a total of 520 boys. The vast
majority are members of the Church of
England.

The fees are, for commoners, £312 per
year and, for scholars, from nil up to £140 per
year according to means. Boys come at the
age of-13, almost invariably from an independent preparatory school, and leave at
18; out of the 100 boys leaving peryear, eighty
go on to Oxford or Cambridge, including
twenty or more who have won scholarships
or exhibitions there. Scholars entering Winchester are selected by a competitive examination in which Latin and Mathematics play
an important part and also Greek and French;
it is extremely difficult to become a scholar
without going to a boarding preparatory
school (fees up to £270 a year), although
about 5 per cent may have been day boys,
and within the past four years there have
been three boys who became scholars from
our own choir school (‘‘ Quiristers ’’), where
they get free education in turn for singing
in chapel. It is also difficult to get into
Winchester as a commoner because there
are about ten applicants for every vacancy ;
this means that few boys are provisionally
accepted who are unable to pass the qualifying entrance exam, which also demands a
fairly high standardin Latinand Mathematics.

INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS

At the moment eight commoners have
been at State grammar schools and their fees
are paid by the county authorities of Hampshire or Hertfordshire; forty-two other
commoners were selected for Exhibitions or
Headmaster’s Nominations on their performance in the examination for Winchester
Scholarships.

The occupations of the parents of Wykehamists are most conveniently given in
Table V, and similar figures are given for a
large urban grammar school. In the final
columns are results from the first questionnaire described in the next section.

The difference between Winchester and
the urban grammar school is very marked in
that army officers, doctors and lawyers at
Winchester take the place of the smaller
business men and skilled workers at the
urban grammar school. The proportion of
scholars who are sons of teachers or other
professional men is double that of the commoners. Of the Old Wykehamists’ occupations, it may be remarked that fewer old boys
than parents are in the army, more old boys
than parents are in the professions (especially
the scholars).

To sum up this section, Wykehamists are
given a high-quality expensive education of
long duration and come from a homogeneous
class (about 30 per cent of parents being Old
Wyehamists). To quote from my school
notes when I was taught General Biology
by Professor Eric Lucas: “ Birth-rate is
negatively correlated to intelligence and
education, also to wealth’’; let us now,
therefore, see what is the actual birth-rate
among Old Wykehamists, and also whether
there is any significant difference between
commoners and scholars.

 

The Differential Birth-Rate

There are two main lines of evidence
leading to the belief that the intelligence of
the nation is declining. First, the negative
correlation already mentioned between intelligence test scores and the number of
brothers and sisters; secondly, the smaller
number of children produced by occupational groups requiring the highest intelligence; both these points have been discussed

6.

2Ir

in detail by Burt, Thomson and others,
especially in this Soczety’s publications.(7) (A
third line of evidence, the increase in mental
deficiency, is not really relevant to the
present inquiry.) Unexpectedly, direct measurements of I.Q., such as those made by
Thomson(3) and Cattell(8) on the children of
Scotland and of Leicester respectively, show
that after fifteen or thirteen years there
has actually been a slight but significant
rise in the mean I.Q., in spite of what had
been predicted. Although these rises have
more or less been explained away, the position is not really satisfactory.

The present inquiry is a _ small-scale
attempt to fill in one of the gaps in the
evidence. Admittedly it is on a highly
selected sample but it compares two groups
—scholars and commoners—with a very
different average I.Q. I have sent out an
inquiry to all boys who entered Winchester
College in the years 1916-20 and asked them
the date of their marriage, how many
children they have had and how many
survived. The advantages of this procedure,
which was dictated by practical convenience,
are, first, that a sample of the parents is taken,
instead of children, and so one can find out
the numbers of the unmarried and the childless and those who have their children late
in life; secondly, that the parents are
selected not by occupation but largely by
intelligence—as I have shown in Sec. 1—
although, unfortunately, they are all of the
high-income group (Sec. 5); thirdly, that as
there is no correlation between intelligence
and family size among present-day Wykehamists (Sec. 4), there is some justification
for considering that this may also be true
of the 1916 vintage of Wykehamists, i.e.
that they may be treated as a homogeneous
group. : |

To simplify the calculation, it was considered that, for replacement, 100 boys
entering the school at age 13 should have
200 children who survived to the age of 13.
For the population as a whole (Population
Report, p. 63)(12), the average family size
during 1928-48 was 2:2 per married couple;
about 91 per cent of males married (p. 23) ;
and at the rate of 89-6 per cent surviving to
212

the age of 30 (Population Papers, Vol. 2,
p. 57, data for 1942)(16), this gives 220 x
QI per cent X 89 per cent=179 children per
100 boys. If, therefore, we find less than
200 surviving children per 100 Old Wykehamists, then as a class they are not replacing
themselves ; if the number is less than 179
then there is evidence of a differential birthrate operating against the survival of Old
Wykehamists, i.e. intelligent persons, and
leading to a decline in the intelligence of the
nation. It may be remarked in passing that
the average family size for non-manual
workers in Great Britain is 1-7.

In order to test whether such a postal
inquiry was feasible, and whether Old
Wykehamists would reply, a “ pilot ”’ sample

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

(total 371) and all scholars now living who
entered between 1906-25 (total 208). It was
not possible to have a larger number of
scholars because those entering after 1925
(aged now under 40) will in many cases not
have completed their families, and very
many of those entering before 1906 had died
or had been killed in the first world war.
In order to find out about. incomplete
families I asked in this second inquiry the
question: “ Are any more children hoped
for? ’’ This turned out to be of considerable
importance. Everyone was assured that the
information, would be treated as confidential
and used for statistical purposes only.
Table VI shows a summary of the results
obtained.

of 138 was taken (commoners entering in
1916, scholars in 1916-20) and these were
written to at the end of May 1952, enclosing
a stamped addressed envelope for reply;
nine days later 50 per cent had replied; ten
weeks later 88 per cent had replied and
information had been obtained about another
7 per cent; evidently the method was practicable. There was in this “ pilot ” sample
a noticeable but not statistically significant
difference between the number of children
of scholars and of commoners, and so the
size of the sample was enlarged by sending
out 441 further questionnaires at the end of
July, sampling all commoners now living
who entered the school in the years 1916-20

Results up to November ist, 1952.

I should like to analyse these results under
the headings of (a) adult mortality, (6) proportion replying—directly or indirectly,
(c) proportion marrying, (d@) age at marriage,
(e) size of family, (f) distribution of family
sizes, (g) child mortality, and then to sum up.

(a) Adult mortality. Of the scholars of the
1906-10 group, one-third were killed in
World War I, and it is evident that the
remainder are rather exceptional in that
many more have died, fewer have married
and the family size is smaller. Of the 194
scholars entering in IQII-25, i.e. the other
three groups, 179 survived, ie. 92°3 per
cent ; and of the 416 commoners entering
in 1916-20, 371 survived, i.e. 89:1 per cent.
INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS

These are not significantly different from
those of the population as a whole ; 89°7 per
cent of 13-year-olds in Great Britain in 1942
are expected to survive till age 47.

(0) Proportion replying. Much of the
information listed in Table VI was obtained
by indirect means, e.g. from Who’s Who
or from friends. The percentages replying
directly, indirectly, or not at all are listed
in Table VII.

commoners who didn’t reply direct, 39/46ths
of them, i.e. 84:8 per cent, were married,
ie. negligibly different from the 86-4 per
cent of the others : the number of surviving
children was at least seventy from thirty-nine
married couples, i.e. 1-80 children, which is
not significantly different from the 2-11 children of the remainder, and in any case it may
be an underestimate because acquaintances
do not always know the full size of the family.

This Io per cent difference in direct replies
between scholars and commoners is very
interesting. It is 3-5 times the standard
error, i.e. the odds are 2,000 to I against
it occurring by chance, and unless you think
—as is very probable—that a scholar would
be more likely than a commoner to reply to
a scholar (myself),the conclusion is that the
higher the intelligence the more co-operative
a person is in replying to questionnaires in
stamped addressed envelopes !

The indirect replies can also be used to
check whether those who did not reply are
a random sample or whether they tend to
have fewer children. Information was
obtained indirectly about two-thirds of the

I think it is therefore fair to say that the
figures I have obtained for 94 per cent of
commoners are typical of the whole group.

(c) Proportion of sample who marry.
Table VIII shows the proportion marrying, the average age at marriage and the
average size of family. Statistically speaking, the only difference here in the proportion
marrying which is significant is that between

general population (90-9 per cent), the odds
are 100 to I against this occurring by chance.

scholars marry later than the general population(17) as would be expected, i.e. at over
30 instead of at 274, the difference being
highly significant.

What is encouraging, and a little unexpected, is the tendency of scholars in recent
years to marry younger, the difference of
Ig years between the 1906-15 groups and
the 1916-25 groups being statistically significant (t=2°3).

(e) Saze of family. For commoners the
family size of 2-12 live-births per married
couple is exactly the same as for women
married eighteen years ago (in 1934) in the
population as a whole (1934 is the median
year of marriage for this group).

It is interesting to calculate the effect of
families being incomplete. Six per cent of
those replying hoped to have more children ;

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

2°10 children for the 1921-25 group will rise
to 2:40. It should be noted that identically
the same result is obtained by the two
different methods of making allowances:
either by assuming that each hopeful parent
will have one more child, or by assuming
that an average of o-3 more children will be
born to each woman married in 1939. If
their allowances are accepted, the conclusion
is most encouraging : that there is a definite
tendency in this most intelligent group in
the sample for family sizes to increase during
this 20-year period, and that the size of
completed families of the 1921-25 group
should be enough to ensure replacement,
after allowing for bachelors and for mortality. —

(f) Distribution of family sizes. Table IX
shows proportions of families with a given

TABLE IX
Distribution of Family Sizes

 

No. of Children . ° I
Winchester (total sample) 16% 16%
Great Britain(15) 17% 25%,

 

 

if they succeed in having one more each, the
size will be 2:19. This is the same as the
figure of 2:19 for women in Great Britain
married in 1929 or earlier, ie. those who
appear to have completed their families.
Thus, the family size of commoners in the
sample is—although inadequate for replacement—no worse than for the population as
a whole.

For scholars in the sample the results are

very interesting :

If allowance is made for incomplete
families the figure of 2-17 children for the
1916-20 group will rise to 2-24, and that of

whole, and 27 per 1,000 for the well-to-do.
The child mortality of commoners is thus
characteristic of the well-to-do.

(h) Summary of inqury. The results of
this inquiry are summarized in Table X.

Discussion of Results. I have, I hope,
shown that—judged by imtelligence tests
—Wykehamists are a highly intelligent
section of the community, and _ that
Winchester Scholars are extremely so, and
it is probable that this was equally true
thirty years ago ; that a sample of over 500
Wykehamists have slightly fewer children
than the population as a whole, 85 per cent

replacement instead of 90 per cent, because .

of the lower marriage rates ; i.e. there is only
slight evidence of a differential birth-rate
with respect to intelligence; the most
encouraging sign is that among the scholars
—who cover a 20-year range—there is.evidence of a steady increase in family size so
that it may be expected that the 1921-25
group (i.e. those born in 1908-13) will have
not merely more children than the average
of the population but even just enough for
replacement. Perhaps in. ten years’ time
someone may repeat this inquiry with a
later group of both commoners and scholars
and see if this optimism is justified..
Finally, I hope I have made it clear that
this research has been very much of a
co-operative undertaking, and many of my
friends and helpers have already been

thanked in this paper.

215

A large number of
other friends and colleagues have assisted by
giving ideas and by administering tests, and
my wife in correcting tests and discussing
the results ; 492 Old Wykehamists courteously replied to an ‘‘ inquisitive little circular
asking for intimate details of their family
planning ” ; twelve headmasters and three
directors of education have been bothered to
do extra work for me, and I should like to
thank them all very much, but most especially our Secretary, Dr. Cedric Carter, who
has provided the driving force and encouragement necessary to get this paper produced.
