_(2.) The second lecture was originally delivered to the West London
Medico-Chirurgical Society. It is an eloquent plea for the creation of
medical mathematicians and, pending the realisation of that ideal, for an
entente cordiale between the statistician and the public health officer.
Among the topics dwelt on are the influence of natural selection on
man and the inheritance of certain special defects, such as achondroplasia.

THIS is a summary of the results reached by various workers in the departments of racial biology and hygiene with the aid of statistical
methods. The article will be of use to many who desire an introduction
to the literature, but the author’s knowledge of statistical processes, if
we may judge by his remarks on page 441 with respect to the meaning
of a coefficient of correlation, is somewhat superficial, and safer guides
may be found in this country.

Davenport, CHarRLeS B., M.D. Eugenics and the Physician. (Re
printed from the “ New York Medical Journal,” June 8th, 1912.)
In this address, delivered to a medical audience, Dr. Davenport
points out the valuable help which ‘physicians might derive from the
systematic study of family traits in their patients, as bearing, for instance,
on individual differences in susceptibility and mode of reaction to infective agents; and he further appeals to medical men to co-operate with
students of heredity in accumulating data concerning the inheritance
of normal.and morbid characters in man. The natural affinity of
Mendelian methods to the individualist attitude of medical practice
should secure a sympathetic response to Dr. Davenport’s invitation.
Though it ought to be well known by this time, it may be worth while
to repeat that the Eugenics Record Office at Cold Spring Harbour, New
York, will furnish printed schedules for recording such data, and will
welcome information with regard to family histories. Dr. Davenport
mentions that he is at present studying the heredity of cleft palate and
harelip, and would be glad to receive data hearing thereon.

THis work is, in the main, an examination of the ethical basis of
punishment. It treats, therefore, of a subject of quite respectable
antiquity which has been so often and so exhaustively discussed in the
past that of necessity the arguments bearing on it have for the most
part become familiar almost to the point of being wearisome. It says
much for Dr. McConnell’s dialectic skill that he has been able to present
so hackneyed a theme in the fresh and interesting form which he has
given to it in this eminently readable volume. Defining punishment
as suffering intentionally inflicted by society on an offending member,
the author in the first part of the work discusses the social merits and
demerits of the four fundamental conceptions to which, in his view, it 1s
possible to reduce the theories of punishment, namely expiation, retribution, deterrence, and reformation. From this inquiry he concludes that
no one of these ideas can be accepted as the exclusive basis of punitive
treatment. On the other hand, each of them, except the idea of expia
