A Note on Andamanese
Demography

THE ANDAMANESE may be considered to represent the most characteristic group of the
isolated pygmy populations of Asia and Oceania. During the course of some millennia it
has remained separated from the continent and without external contacts, and is thus likely
to exhibit a high level of racial homogeneity. These people led and lead an economically
primitive life; they hunt, fish, and collect the products of the jungle.

In earlier times, at least up to the beginning of this century, the Andamanese were
considered to be divided into twelve tribes, which inhabited different parts of the Islands.
They adhered to their own recognized territorial limits and had little or no connection with
each other. Not only was there inter-tribal hostility, but they were also constantly aggressive
to all strangers landing on the Islands. This explains the lack of contact with the Europeans
and Indians who have now settled on parts of the archipelago.

An estimate of the total Andamanese population has never been accurately ascertained.
At the first Census taken in the Archipelago in 1901, the few hundreds belonging to the
so-called “‘friendly tribes” were enumerated. In contrast, the “‘hostile-tribes”’ lived deep in
jungle and on the southern islands, and their numbers have always been very uncertain.
At the 1901 Census and at the successive decennial Censuses, the Andamanese have,
therefore, been divided into the two fundamental groups, the “friendly”, and “‘hostile”
tribes. The denominations of the latter were practically unknown, but they were indicated
as Jarawa and Onge. In Table 1 I give the essential data concerning the de facto population
and a development of the figures concerning the “friendly tribes” is shown in Table 2.

The data (with the exception of that from the 1901 Census) show that there was a
larger number of females than of males. Such an inequality is probably due to various

elements favourable to the females, in that they did not participate in tribal wars, generally
avoided the accidents associated with hunting and fishing, carried out lighter and less
dangerous tasks, and were considerably protected by their husbands.

Owing to the small number of individuals in each tribe, the sex-ratio (males per 100
females) is not statistically significant. In the 1901 Census this ratio was 115-5, which perhaps
gives a fairly true picture; but in the subsequent Censuses the ratio figures are no longer
indicative, changing to 94-4 in 1911, and 99-0 in 1921; and going down to 57-4 in 1931.
The sex-balance seems better in the group comprising the four Northern tribes (Yere,
Tabo, Kora, and Chariar), in which the ratio was 113-3 in 1901. This relation is reversed,
as in the preceding case, in 1931 with the figures of 56-5. Taking adults only, the difference
was even greater; 111-5 in 1901, and 48-8 in 1931. For the children, the ratio in 1901 was
132-1 and in 1931, 120-0.

The percentage of children at each Census relative to the adult population does not
appear abnormal. In fact, three of these values lie in the variation-field of the mean +1a,
the fourth with +2c. These percentages are: 20-8 in 1901, 21-1 in 1911, 17-7 in 1921, and
19-9 in 1931. Such values can be partially compared with those pertaining to the Onge
tribe (which has always been very much isolated), whose percentages are 14-3 in 1901,
31-5 in 1911, and 29-2 in 1921. We can add the value of 28-5 from Cipriani’s 3 enumeration
in 1954 of the Onges of Little Andaman.

We have no data about the number of families at each Census and we cannot therefore
calculate the number of births and children per family, as the Census data represent only
the number of surviving children. However, it is possible to estimate the probable number
of families or couples (we know that the Andamanese are monogamous) through the number
of adult males and females who could mate. These couples were 234 with 130 children at
the 1901 Census, 170 with 96 in 1911, 84 with 37 in 1921, and 21 with 11 in 1931. The
corresponding values of children per couple are respectively: 0-56, 0-56, 0-44, 0-52. These
values are statistically normal, since three of them lie in the variation-field of the mean
value +1o, and the fourth with +2c. We can add the figure of 0-80 for the Onges of Little
Andaman enumerated in 1954 by Cipriani.

252
A NOTE ON ANDAMANESE DEMOGRAPHY

Mention might be made here of certain other values from Cipriani’s 7’ > demographic
data. He has been able to enumerate 569 Onges, of which 296 were male (204 adult and 92
children) and 273 female (203 adults and 70 children). These Onges then represent 203
couples with 162 children, which gives a ratio of 0-8 children per couple. The general
sex-ratio is 108-4, but the figure is particularly influenced by the lack of female children
in the group, while the sex-ratio of adults is 100-5. Probably this asymmetry is only apparent,
owing to the difficulty in enumerating all the children; the percentage of these to the total
of Onges is 28-5.

The investigations made in recent years, and particularly Cipriani’s results for the
Little Andaman, show that the early evaluations were in default. For instance, he enumerated in 1953-54 more than 500 Onges and calculated their number to be between 500 and
600, whereas the estimated figures at the 1931 Census were 250. It is, therefore, extremely
difficult to form a correct or even a reasonable idea about the real population trend.

In my opinion, there are two distinct curves to be considered; one of the so-called
“friendly tribes”, ending perhaps in their extinction; and the other for the so-called “hostile
tribes” (Jarawa and Onge) with a birth/death rate which could even be normal. But yet
the general trend appears to be negative. In fact the friendly tribes show a steady decline,
easily estimated by the figures in Table 1. During the period 1858-1955 the demographic
deficit was so sharp as to reach the 79-2 per cent on the figure of my estimation of the 1958
population. ©

Indeed the Andamanese population has followed the involutive trend which is
characteristic of nearly all isolated racial groups, namely a falling parabola towards
extinction. At the beginning of the last century the Andamanese were certainly in a state
of demographic equilibrium, both by sex and age groups, but it was a weak equilibrium,
which existed and still exists in relation to the environment. In fact, in such primitive
populations this equilibrium must balance the demographic density and the area of the
territories available for their maintenance.

As the regression of the Andamanese population is similar to that which is nearly
always shown by all isolated and peripheral racial groups, we must ascribe it to demographic
factors, rather than to biological involution. Therefore, the hypothesis of a diminution of
their generative power is highly improbable, although the influence of syphilis on sterility
must be considered, as individuals of the so-called friendly tribes were syphilitic. On the
same grounds epidemics have had a powerful influence, but always with a very different
level of results. That there has been a general line of involution is proved by the fact that
the reduction has been constant for each tribe, no matter where its residence.

In 1931 what remained of the so-called friendly tribes—about seventy individuals
belonging to the ten old tribes (now reduced to six)—lived in an isolated region, the Ritchie
Archipelago. The officers in charge thought to preserve in this way the remnant of the population. But Bonington, in his Report,! observed that most of the group showed signs of
syphilis and were therefore in bad health. In fact, deaths occurred at the rate of nearly
one per month.

What are the causes of such a reduction and consequently of extinction? It is not easy
to determine any single cause, but the elements of greater importance are well known and
it is also possible to assess, at any rate partially, the relative weight they have had in the
demographic regression.

Such elements can be grouped into two categories, not exactly independent, as they
often acted on the phenomenon in a convergent sense. The first of these categories I call
*‘demographic’’, the second, to be termed “‘environmental’’, includes the contingent causes.
In detail the causes under the latter heading can be grouped into three main categories:
a. Elements which have indirectly contributed to diminishing the organic resistance of

253
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

individuals, as for instance the institution of so-called “homes” (the misplaced feeling of
humanitarianism towards the aborigines resulted in the building of huts and shelters, and
the distribution of dresses and blankets); b. Epidemics which have directly sapped the existence of the primitives, (bronchic-pulmonary affections in 1868, syphilis in 1876, measles
in 1877, influenza in 1892); c. Long-term disease factors which have contributed and still
contribute to lessening the organic resistence of these groups, such as malarial fever, benign
bronchial affections, and diseases of the digestive system.

The epidemics eliminated many of reproductive age. For instance Man 5 estimated
that, during the measles epidemic of 1877, a fifth of the population died.

The first category, which I have called ““cdemographic’’, contains the causes which are
nearly all present in small isolated populations. These show generally a constant low birth
rate, a high mortality rate, and an exceptionally long intergenesial interval, which is strictly
connected with the nursing period. Indeed, such an interval would be greater without the
heavy infant mortality, which interrupts the nursing period.

But these factors, negative as they are, are even surpassed, in my opinion, by the
hyperfractionizing, i.e. the division of the population into tribes, generally observing a close
endogamy. In such tiny groups (i.e. the tribes) the demographic composition is always
unstable, often a fatal abnormality, because it alters the structure of age groups and distorts
the sex-ratio in each tribe, which, being extremely endogamic, has no possibility of interchange with other tribes. This altered condition, in some cases, is increased by geographic
distance or isolation. Such tiny groups approach then a breaking point, up to which their
own homogeneity has permitted an unstable maintenance of the population structure.
Such a structure in the Andamanese population has suffered much from the negative
factors, which have all acted in one direction convergently.

Although unable to give data on the Andamanese population decline it is quite possible
that the curve of decline started after 1860, that is, following upon and parallel to the numerous epidemics 5. Undoubtedly, the Andamanese formed, and still form, a typical isolated
population. Obviously, the starting point for a demographic study on a primitive group is
the so-called “natural or uncontaminated status”’ in which it has existed without external
contacts during rather a long period. Consequently, at least in theory, the demographic
phenomena of such a population should be studied and analysed only before or during the
period which precedes the eventual contacts.

For the Andamanese we have no satisfactory data about their demographic phenomena,
but during Molesworth’s 8 work in 1893, in taking many anthropometric measurements
(preparatory to the 1901 Census) some demographic data were collected. In such investigation of the vital statistics, 100 females (aged twenty-two to fifty-three, with one aged
sixty-five) were questioned in respect to the number of births and husbands they had had
and the number of their sons and daughters still living. Five out of the hundred were
unmarried; the collected data then concerned the other ninety-five. The results of my
analysis can be summarized as follows:

a. The total number of births were 149, divided into ninety-two males and fifty-seven
females;

b. the sex-ratio at birth was 161-4 (per 100 females);

c. the value of the average ratio of births per mother was 1-57;

d. the survivors at the time of the inquiry were twenty-six (fifteen M. and eleven F.)
out of a total of 149 births, i.e. less than a sixth of them, with a mortality ratio of 82-6.

The essential data is shown in Table 3.
The unmarried women were of the following ages: one of 22 years, one of 23, two of 27,
one of 36. My conclusions are: firstly, the women of greater age at the moment of the inquiry

254
A NOTE ON ANDAMANESE DEMOGRAPHY

obviously showed a higher fertility. In fact, as the women aged from twenty-three to twentyseven inclusive (representing 13-7 per cent of the total) had had no births, all the births
must perforce be credited to the remaining 86-3 per cent of the women. Therefore, as far
as the data indicate, it would appear that the fertile life of the Andamanese woman does
not start at a very youthful age. This is a partial confirmation of Day’s 4 and Man’s 5: & 7
judgements, when they pointed to the low fertility of the Andamanese women and their
comparatively delayed sexual development.

Age = Age in years at the time of the Inquiry.
F.I. = Fertility Index (Births per woman of the given age).

At all ages one notes a comparatively low degree of fertility, but on the other hand
account must be taken of certain exceptions, as for instance, a woman only once married
who had six children and another (twice married) with eight children; against that, there
is the woman who, married four times, only gave birth to two children. One might advance
the hypothesis that fertility has declined during the course of time and that therefore the
older women (for the Andamanese that period begins before forty-five) produced a greater
proportion of births than the younger generation. Such a suggestion strikes one with greater
force, if the ninety-five females are divided into age-groups. The data show that the fertility
rate climbs with the increase of the age of the individual. Apart from the fact that the longer
existence of the older women logically produced a larger number of births, the fertility
index still shows a puzzling problem difficult to solve. In fact, such an index should have
shown no practical difference between the two age groups of forty-one to forty-eight and
fifty and over, while the actual figure for the latter is more than double the former.

Evidently the number of husbands belonging to the women examined had its influence
on the total fertility. For the 95 women there were 145 husbands. Considering the relative
number of husbands and the respective number of births, I conclude: firstly that more than
half of these women (55) have had only one husband, not quite a third (31) had married
twice, and less than a tenth (8) three times; the number of four husbands is exceptional
(only one female in 95). Secondly, I found that the number of births is logically higher for
the women who have had two husbands (1:94 births per woman) than for those with only
one husband, although the increase is not proportional (1:94 against 1-31). Also the
increase in the group with three husbands is not proportional (1-88). The data show that
the number of husbands has no markedly relevant influence on the total fertility (see
Table 4).

In my opinion, even before the epidemics, there were unstable demographic conditions
which tended to start a regression. The few sources of information in our possession seem
to confirm my hypothesis. For instance, in the territory around the so-called “homes”,

255
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

during the year April 1868—April 1869, fourteen births occurred against thirty-eight deaths.
Day informs us that no family has more than two children and Man affirms that each
Andamanese couple counted as an average three to four births. He says that he has seen
only one family with six children, three of which reached an adult age. Twins were rare,
and there is no record that both survived. Man has never known of triplets. Both Man
and Day say that there was at birth a slight prevalence of females, that the suckling period
was extremely long, three to four years, that puberty was comparatively delayed, that the
presumable fertility age was rather short, going from sixteen to thirty-five years, and they
estimated an average length of life of twenty-two years, with a limit of less than fifty,
which only women reached. My examination of about a hundred skulls confirms this last
remark.9

Of course, the demographic conditions subsequent to the epidemics became worse and
worse, with a convergence of negative factors: a very high mortality, which rate I have
calculated as being 82-6 per cent, an even greater infant mortality, and a fertility very low
or nil. Without affirming that such negative factors affected all the Andamanese, we know
that they were shown by the so-called friendly tribes and those who lived in the “‘homes”’.
Homfrey notes that in 1866 in the “home” at Port Mouat, fifteen births occurred during
three months and not one infant survived. Another source says that in 1870 in another
“‘*home”’ two births 2 month occurred, but the infants survived a week only.
