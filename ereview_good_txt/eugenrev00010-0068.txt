Commonwealth Immigration

SOME

A NATURAL AND proper disinclination to
distinguish, in the statistics, between persons of
a different colour or place of origin has lead to a
dearth of information about Commonwealth
immigrants in Britain. This has now been
partially remedied in a 1961 Census volume that
is both original and interesting. The Registrar
General for England and Wales has issued a
Blue Book entitled Commonwealth Immigrants
in the Conurbations in which information is given
concerning their sex, age, marital status, occupations and special qualifications according to
birthplace.

Out of the 46 million persons enumerated in
this country in 1961, 14 million had been born
overseas. A little under one-half of these were
born in the Commonwealth and one-third
(about 4 million) were born in the Caribbean,
the Indian sub-continent, in Africa or the
Mediterranean area. It is with these four areas of
origin that the volume is concerned. About
one-half of the immigrants had found their way
into the six conurbations as follows:

 

Tyneside 2,000
West Yorkshire 12,000
South-east Lancashire 11,000
Merseyside 6,000
West Midlands 31,000
Greater London 193,000

Total 255,000

 

Of these, 105,000 were born in the Caribbean,
90,000 in India and Pakistan, 20,000 in Africa
and 40,000 in Cyprus or Malta.

The statistics given below relate to these
255,000 people, of whom 130,000 were men,
100,000 women and 25,000 children. Not only
their sex-proportions but also their age-distribution has a special character. Under 10 per cent
were below the age of fifteen—compare over

20 per cent for the native British population.
Only 3 per cent were sixty-five or over (compare
12 per cent). Nearly 75 per cent were between
the ages of fifteen and forty-five (compare 40 per
cent). This is as would be expected from general
observation, but it is interesting to note that the
degree of concentration into the “young adult”
age-group is more marked for immigrants in the
conurbations than it is for Commonwealth
immigrants generally—16 per cent of whom were
under age fifteen, 7 per cent sixty-five or over,
56 per cent between fifteen and forty-five and
21 per cent between forty-five and sixty-five in
1961. It is as though a screening for age operated
in two stages—one on entering the country and
one on going to the conurbations—although in
practice it is doubtful whether these two stages
are distinguishable. Presumably, both the types
of job available and the. nature of the living
accommodation are important factors in this
process of “‘screening”’.

In an era of complaints about the “brain
drain” it is interesting to note that one-third of
these immigrants gave the age at which their
full-time education ceased as being at least
seventeen, and nearly 1 per cent claimed to be
specially qualified in science or technology.
Only for the second of these two pieces of
information are the corresponding 1961 data
yet available for England and Wales as a whole:
the proportion is about 1 in 150, or lower than
for the immigrants. In this connection, however,
differences in age distribution, and also perhaps
in academic standards, must be borne in mind.

Out of the 230,000 immigrants aged fifteen
and over, no less than 40,000 were “‘economically
inactive’—mostly housewives—and nearly
10,000 more were sick or unemployed. Most of
the remainder were in full-time employment,
but it is interesting to note that 7,000 were
self-employed and 4,000 occupied managerial

The corresponding data for England and
Wales as a whole bear a general resemblance
to those in the Table for the Mediterranean
area. It is noteworthy, however, that women
from this area more often work in a semi-skilled
manual capacity than British women, while the
reverse is true as regards men. Other prominent
features in the Table are the high proportion
of persons in category A, except for those born
in the Caribbean area, and the unusually large
concentrations of Indians and Africans in
category B—probably mostly clerical occupations, whereas those from the West Indies
have taken more to semi-skilled manual work.
It will be appreciated that these are wide
categories and that the data can be only broadly
indicative, when differences in sex and age
clerical workers among Indians and Africans,
who also are strongly represented in the
professional and technical classes. Persons from
the Mediterranean area are highly concentrated
in the clothing industry and in service (i.e.
waiters)—one-half of them figure in these two
groups. Those born in the Caribbean area are
most widely distributed among the occupations
of all the immigrants—in this respect at least
they are thus the best assimilated—but there are
two occupation groups in which no appreciable
numbers of immigrants are to be found—
farming and mining.

It is a pity that no information on fertility is
included in this volume. There are some useful
tables showing household composition, but
these cannot throw any proper light on fertility.
