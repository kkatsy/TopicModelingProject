HUMAN DIVERSITY
KENNETH MATHER

What makes human beings different from one another? Why is it that each of us
is unique? Human diversity has been the subject of interest and speculation since
the beginning of man. It has been accepted as inevitable and bewailed as unjust;
made the basis of reverence and of persecution; attributed to divine creation and
to diabolical intervention. It has been traced to heredity and to the environment,
to ancestry and to upbringing, often with a gross distortion of the evidence and
a perverse interpretation of the conclusions. In this fascinating study Professor
Mather looks at the various causes of diversity—environmental, genetical and
social; sees how they act and interact; and examines the way natural selection is
related to and works on the differences they bring about.
