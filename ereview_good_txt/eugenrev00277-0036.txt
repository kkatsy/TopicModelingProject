f their amounts. | 7

perms, we decided that the spermicide must

The second part of this paper contains a
detailed description of vehicles for phenyl
mercuric acetate. Our various formule for
contraceptive products containing phenyl
mercuric acetate and nitrate are numbered
P.1, P.2, P.3, etc.

The registered name Volpar, which is a
contraction of the words voluntary parenthood, was suggested by Dr. M. Newfield.

Phenyl mercuric acetate

This compound, and the nitrate, are the
most spermicidal substances known. There
was No @ priort reason to suppose it likely
that the most spermicidal substances should
be the best spermicides for practical use, for
it might be either cheaper, or necessary on
pathological grounds, to use a’ greater
quantity of a weaker spermicide. However,
Dr. H. M. Carleton showed that solutions of
both the acetate and the nitrate are harmless
to the vagina, and they are so unitritating
that the nitrate is used for direct application
to the eye. Further, the cost of these substances is not prohibitive. It has. therefore
come about that our chosen spermicide is the
most spermicidal substance known. We have

preferred the acetate to the nitrate, because
it is easier to make a permanently stable

solution of it in water.

Phenyl mercuric acetate, CH,COO-Hg
isa colourless solid, slightly soluble in water.

It was among the substances whose investigation was suggested to us by The British
Drug Houses Ltd., when we had discovered
262

the very high spermicidal powers of another
organic mercury compound, sodium ethyl
mercuri - thiosalicylate. The
powers of phenyl mercuric acetate are compared with those of other very spermicidal
substances, and also of quinine bisulphate,
in Table I. The substances are arranged in
order of spermicidal power in the Table.
Spermicidal power is determined by a
rather elaborate test, full details of which
have been published (Baker, Ranson and
Tynen, 1937). Human semen is used. Our
specimens, mostly provided by ten regular
donors, are caught at coition in sheaths
made of scarcely spermicidal rubber (Ranson, 1937), and quickly transferred to clean
glass tubes. The experiments are carried
out at the temperature of the body. 7
Each substance is tried at various concentrations in the series 2, 1, $, 3, etc., per
cent., and the lowest concentration in this
series which suffices to kill (not merely
immobilize) all sperms in half an hour in
each of three consecutive tests with different
specimens of semen is called the killing
concentration. The reasons for choosing half
an hour as the standard time have been
explained at some length (Baker, 1935,
Chapter 3). Observations on the activity of
the sperms are also made at five minutes.
The activity of the sperms is shown by
the symbols 3++, 3, 2+, 2, 1+, 1, 1°, 1*, and
Oo. 3-+ represents extreme activity, and 3
full ordinary activity; while o indicates
that not the slightest movement of a single
sperm was seen in ten microscopical fields of
view with a one-sixth inch objective. The
other symbols represent intermediate.grades
of activity. The symbol r° means that movement was confined to a few sperms protected
from the spermicide by being in the middle
of sperm clumps, while 1* is used, to indicate
that only a single sperm was seen to move in
the ten fields. Careful controls are kept and
the test is disregarded if the control sperms
do not show good activity. The results of
the test are written down, e.g., as follows:
2/o/1. The first figure represents the activity
at five minutes and the second at half an hour,
while the third shows the results of diluting

exists would suggest the former. This is ,

subject, however, on which there is

certainty, and safety can only be ensured by

using spermicides which are not. very sengj

tive to changes in reaction. |
Table I shows that phenyl mercury

acetate has a killing concentration of ;4,

bisulphate, which has been ‘used so much 3
a contraceptive, has a killing concentratioy
of 4 per cent. in both acid and alkalin

times more spermicidal in acid and 128 time
in alkaline solution. | .

‘Not all organic mercury compounds ar
highly spermicidal. Thus both mersalyl and
neptal fail to kill every time jat'4 per cent,
and have approximately the same spermicidal power as quinine bisulphate. |

Contraceptive suppositories are tested for
total spermicidal power in the same way as
pure substances, except that the concentrations are differently expressed. In accordance with the wish of the Medical Sub
committee of the National Birth Control .

Association, we postulate that the average
amount of fluid in the vagina after ejaculation

mens of gelatine differ greatly both in the
consistency which their gels provide at a
given concentration, and also in the amount
of alkali necessary to bring them to a given
pH. We have chosen gold label gelatine
because of its purity and uniformity in these
respects.

Phenyl mercuric acetate remains indefinitely in solution in the water of gelatine gels,
provided that they are rendered slightly
alkaline by a suitable buffer. The pH of
gelatine gels affects their consistency, and
the amount of gelatine has to be so arranged
that the consistency will be right at the
selected pH. After much experimenting we
found 7-5 per cent. to be correct, when the
gold label material is used and the pH is
about 8-0. This gives a product which is
sufficiently firm to be readily handled at all
ordinary room temperatures in Great
Britain, and yet which melts rapidly at
body temperatures and gives a fluidity
favourable to rapid diffusion of the spermicide into semen, as shown by the diffusion
test (see Part 2). a

Volpar gels are intended to be kept in

drawers or cupboards away from fires and

radiators. An investigation was made of the
temperatures attained in drawers and cupboards dusing the summer months at
Oxford. Four maximum thermometers and
a thermograph were exposed in closed
drawers and cupboards in five different
houses throughout the hottest months (July,
August and September 1938). The maxima
attained during this period are recorded in
Table IV. _

_The thermograph was exposed from May
till September (inclusive).in a cupboard on
an external south wall. It revealed that the
variation in temperature during the course
of the twenty-four hours is generally less
than 1-5°C., and that the greatest variation
in that period was 2-6°C. (on May 5th-6th).
A closed cupboard is thus to some extent a
thermostat. An unexpected result was that
the maximum temperature for the day is
usually reached about 10 p.m:, when the
room, heated by the warmth of daytime, has

Volpar gels have sufficient gelatine to be
solid and not sticky at 27°C: (80:6°F.). The
figures given in Table IV suggest that this
gives sufficient margin for them to be used
in this country without danger of their
becoming sticky under conditions of home
storage. If luggage is exposed to the direct
rays of the sun when one is travelling during
exceptionally hot weather, the contents may
be raised to a higher temperature, and special

precautions in packing the gels must be.

taken. It will usually suffice to keep the
glass tube containing the gels in its cardboard
box and to wrap this among one’s clothes
away from the surface of the package. The
tube of gels should not be carried in pockets
and thus exposed to the warmth of the body.
It will be obvious that Volpar gels are
unsuited for use in hot climates.

Rapid disintegration at body temperature
is an important quality in fatty and gel
suppositories. It is measured by noting how
long a suppository takes to melt completely

takes into consideration not only th
melting-point but also the specific heg.
and conductivity of the product. )

In general Volpar gels disintegrate in the
test in about two or three minutes, but in the
earlier part of our work we were occasionally '
disappointed to find that a specimen which :
had been kept for about nine months took.
much longer. This was difficult to under.
stand, since other equally old specimens had
not changed in the same way. We therefor.
set out to discover the cause of this * tough.
ening ”’ process, and if possible a cure for it,

We soon found that the toughening of
certain gels occurred very much mor
rapidly at a high temperature, provided that
it was not sufficient to melt the product, and
we were thus able to “ toughen ”’ artificially
in a few days to a degree that would take
nearly a year at ordinary room temperature,
A convenient way of toughening is to keep
the gels for one day at 27°C., one day at
28°C., and finally.one day or more at 30°
or 31°C. The days at the lower temperature,
by starting the toughening process, prevent
any tendency for stickiness or melting to
begin at the higher. It is necessary to stres
that the process of toughening, as described
above, is not the result of evaporation, for
no loss of water-occurs.. . ©

A toughened gel not only has a higher
melting-point, which sometimes exceeds th
temperature of the body, but also is 9
changed in its physical character that. when
it does disintegrate it forms a stringy mas
instead of dissolving readily in water at the
melting point. This would be most’ undesir
able in a chemical contraceptive.

When we had this method of toughening
artificially at -our disposal, we directed ow
efforts towards trying to’ understand. why

one specimen kept at room temperature for
a long time became tough while another did
not. One of us (R. M. R.) discovered that it
depended on the length of time that. the
gelatine had been heated during the preparation of the gel, and on the temperature
attained during that period. The longer the
time and the higher the temperature, the
less the tendency for subsequent toughening.
A partial conversion of the gelatine to metagelatine is perhaps concerned.

We give the name “ anti-toughening ”’ to
that treatment of a gelatine sol which
renders the gel formed from it less readily
toughened. The treatment consists in holding the gelatine sol at a high temperature for
a considerable time. There is no point, and
there might be some danger, in treating the
spermicidal substance in the same way, and
we therefore dissolve the phenyl mercuric
acetate separately from the gelatine. We
dissolve the latter in part of the water in the
presence of sufficient of the alkaline buffer
to raise the pH just above neutrality, and
anti-toughen this solution. The remainder
of the buffer is used to dissolve the phenyl
mercuric acetate in the rest of the water.
The two solutions are mixed at 40°C.

Fig. I is a graph showing the effect of antitoughening treatment on the disintegration
times of P.383. The graph shows the
effects of various periods of anti-toughening
treatment at 65°C. This is a convenient

temperature for practical use, since it is

neither so high as to cause a risk of total
conversion to metagelatine nor so low as to
make very prolonged heating necessary.
Every point on the graph (except one) is the
mean of six determinations of disintegration
time. (The exception is the mean of four
determinations.)

The graph shows that subsequent toughening is not completely prevented at 65°C., but
that it may be greatly lessened. Too much
anti-toughening makes a product which is
too soft at room-temperature and does not
fulfil our requirement of being non-sticky at
27°C. A compromise is necessary, and about

 

‘iB hour at 65°C. is a suitable time, whig,

    
   
  
    
    

gives a product that is easily handled but ny
readily toughened under ordinary conditio,,

Our findings on toughening may be sup,
marized thus: Toughening occurs moy
rapidly at temperatures just below th,
melting point. It disappears entirely if th
