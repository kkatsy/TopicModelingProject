NOTES AND MEMORANDA

EUROPEAN POPULATION
CONFERENCE

THE EUROPEAN POPULATION Conference
which is being organized by the Council of
Europe in Strasbourg from 30th August to 6th
September 1966 will be the first occasion on
which population problems have been dealt with
at European level.

The Organizing Committee, whose Chairman
is Mr. Jean Bourgeois-Pichat, Director of the
National Institute of Demographic Studies in
Paris, has drawn up a programme based on five
general themes: fertility trends, mortality trends,
migratory movements, trends in population
structures, and teaching and demographic
research in Europe.

The Conference, at which all the sessions will
be public, will be essentially scientific in character.
It will analyse the facts and deduce the causes
and effects, in particular the social and economic
effects, of population trends. The Organizing
Committee has drawn up a preliminary list of
participants: in addition to government experts
from the member countries there will be some
sixty independent experts and about fifty
observers representing, in the main, international
organizations interested in the work of the
Conference. Several experts from non-member
countries, including countries of Eastern Europe,
will attend.

POPULATION CRISIS COMMITTEE

GENERAL WILLIAM H. DRAPER has replaced
former Senator Keating as National Chairman
of the Population Crisis Committee, an organization formed in April 1965 with headquarters in
Washington, D.C. It seeks to increase public
understanding of the dangers of the world
population explosion and to encourage public
and private programmes in the fields of population, public health and family planning.
General Draper is the author of the 1959
Draper Report recommending U.S. government
aid, on request, to underdeveloped nations to

curb rapid population growth. He has predicted
widespread famine unless birth control on a
massive scale is soon practised in the developing
countries: the world is facing a population crisis
more serious in effect than anything Malthus
dreamed possible.
