NOTES AND MEMORANDA

PERSONALITY AND FERTILITY

IN THE DECEMBER 1966 number of THE EUGENICS REVIEW (58, 205) we wrote on the
study of personality development being carried out by the MRC Psychiatric Genetics
Research Unit at the Maudsley Hospital.

Arising out of this study, the UK Medlars Information Retrieval Service was asked
to carry out a search for literature on the relationship between personality and fertility.

Dr. John Price, who has kindly sent us the resulting list of references, suggests that
some of them might be useful to those of our readers who are engaged in research on these
lines.

Only literature from the beginning of 1963 was searched. The index headings for
personality were: aggression, authoritarianism, character, motivation, emotion, intelligence,
orientation, self, social desirability, sociopathic personality, personality, leadership. These
were permuted with the index headings for fertility: fertility, reproduction, breeding,
sterility (male and female).

It should be noted that the Service is in an experimental stage and the list cannot be
expected to be complete; even so, it is significantly short, and the proportion of relevance
to eugenics is somewhat meagre.

The references are printed below, followed by the more relevant of the index headings
given in the computer output, which did not include the papers by Hare and Shaw and by
Westoff and Kiser.
