RACIAL MIXTURE IN GREAT BRITAIN:
SOME ANTHROPOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ANGLO-NEGROID CROSS

A Preliminary Report

By K. L. LITTLE
(Lhe Duckworth Laboratory, University Museum of Ethnology, Cambridge)

ITH the exception of a large
number of family studies secured
by Miss R. M. Fleming,* little:

anthropological attention has so far been
given to the question of racial crossing in this
country, although the presence of some
fairly extensive hybrid communities in most
of our sea-port cities affords an excellent
opportunity for anthropometric investigation, particularly in respect to the AngloNegroid cross.t The present paper, comprising-a brief statistical analysis of the measurements of some ninety Anglo-Negroid or
‘‘ Coloured ” children, together with a smaller
“White ” sample of forty drawn from the
same environment, represents what it is
hoped may be merely a prelude to a wider
and statistically more adequate survey of the
subject, especially as far as the adult element
is concerned. The present data, including
those of a small number of adults with one
Fr adult exception, were gained entirely
from a community in Cardiff, where all the
subjects were born. In the course of the

enquiry the opportunity was taken of
examining a further sample of some eighty
subjects mainly of Anglo-Arab and AngloMediterranean parentage. These, however,
have been omitted from the present’ discussion for considerations of space. The
Anglo-Negroid adult sample is as yet too
small for statistical treatment, and has
similarly been omitted, although a few
particulars as to its characters are given
below.*

Briefly stated, the aspects of racial crossing
it is intended to cover comprise such questions as the segregation of both quantitative
and qualitative physical characters in the
hybrid population, the comparative variability of the respective groups, and comparative differences in growth and sex
differences. In the light of these considerations it was decided to employ as wide an
assortment of characters as was practicable,
and having regard to the specific racial
stocks involved, i.e. Negroid and Caucasoid

these are first crosses, and two may be listed as NNW

and one as NWW (see later paragraph). Their cephalic

(White), to give special attention to those
features which show clear differentiation
between the parent stocks. In terms of the
present facilities these may be listed as skin,
hair and eye colour, lip thickness, nasal
width and height and the corresponding
nasal index, and the ratio of nasal depth to
width. In addition, a fairly large number of
characters possessing genetical rather than
racial significance were chosen, and these
included such features as head length, head
breadth, facial length, etc., etc., from which
the relevant cephalic, facial, fronto-jugal and
other indices were obtained. Finally, two
modifiable characters in the shape of stature
and sitting height were included.

For the sake of brevity, these characters
are summarized below and listed under
convenient symbols :

L—Maximum length of head (1).
B—Maximum breadth of head (1).
B4—Minimum forehead width (1).
Q—Transverse arc measured over the
head (3).
GH—Total facial height taken from
nasion to gnathion (i).
G1H—Upper facial height taken from
nasion to prosthion (2).
J—Maximum interzygomatic breadth

(r).
W—Gonial breadth. The diameter between the extreme outer points of
the angles of the lower jaw (1).
NH—Nasal height. Nasion to. subnasale

(2).

NB—Nasal breadth. The greatest
diameter taken between the wings
of the nose (2).

Cr.—T. Taken from tip of nose (pronasale) to the crease (2).

ND—Depth of nose, taken from pronasale
to subnasale (2).

EOQ—Maximum diameter between the
ia margins of the orbital openings
(x).

JO—Maximum diameter between the

| internal corners of the eye (1).

LC—Thickness of lips (centre) i.e. labrale
superior to labrale inferior (2).

LL—Thickness of lips (left side) (2).

113

EL—Ear length or physiognomic height:
| of ear (I).
EW —Ear width or physiognomic width of
ear (I).
S—Total height standing (taken in
stockings) (3).
_SH—Height sitting (3).
Wt.—Weight (4). . |
SE—Colour of exposed skin.
SU—Colour of unexposed skin.
HC—Colour of hair.
EC—Colour of iris of the eye.

Note.—A fuller description of most of the above
measurements and observations will be found in
Anthropometric Investigation in the British Isles.
Report of the British Association (Dublin) 1908.

In the observation of skin colour the von Luschan
scale was used, the exposed skin being noted on the
outer side of the wrist, and the unexposed skin on the
inner side of the arm. For eye and hair observations
the scales used were respectively the Rudolf Martin
Augenfarben-Tafel and the Fischer Saller.

It will be noted from the various Tables
that the subjects have been divided into
groups of “‘ Coloured ”’ and “ White ”’ males
and females. The White are designated on
the basis of both parents being of pure
Caucasoid stock and natives of this country,
and the Coloured on the basis of one or both
parents carrying any amount of Negroid
genes.* The Coloured have been further subdivided into the three broad categories of
NNW, Fi, and NWW?.t The NNW
category is regarded as comprising subjects
who on balance owe more to Negroid than
White ancestry, and conversely, the NWW ?
as subjects who owe more to White than
Negroid parentage. For example, subjects
were designated NNW with a West Indian
father and a Coloured mother, and NWW ?
with a West Indian father and a White
mother. These classifications are therefore

* The expressions White and Coloured obviously
possess little value in the strict racial sense, and are
used here solely for their applicability in terms of the
cultural context.

somewhat arbitrary, particularly as far as
the latter one is concerned, wherein one might
reasonably expect to find a number of first
crosses ; but for present purposes largely
inevitable owing to the difficulties of checking
on the genealogy of the father in his not
infrequent absence at sea. On the other hand
the determination of the F1 category, as
representing the first cross between the male
West African and the ‘“ English ’”’ woman is
a more straightforward proposition.*

The whole question of parentage and
ancestry is of course one which demands
extremely careful attention, and in his classic
study of the American Negro Herskovits has
mentioned some of the difficulties in the way
of obtaining exact genealogical records :

“Each person was classified according
to his known (or, if the term is preferable,
his stated) ancestry.

“In other words the individual was
placed in a given genealogical class according to the information he was able or
willing to give. It is not claimed that the
classes represent hard and fast lines ; that,
for example, the class ‘about the same
amount of Negro and White ancestry ’ is
exactly one-half Negro and one-half White.
There may be fairly large variations from
this rigid standard, as there must be in any

‘series of genealogical data.” ¢

In another American investigation of a
somewhat similar nature the device of
estimating the ancestry of the subject by the
reverse process of working back from his

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

actual physique has been adopted.* Plainly,
neither method is altogether satisfactory ; on
the one hand because exact genealogical
knowledge is often lacking, and on ‘the other
for obvious genetical reasons. In the present
instance, however, part of the difficulty was
obviated by the undoubted Caucasoid ancestry of a large proportion of the female
parents.t The less easy task of estimating
the ancestry of the remainder and of providing a general check was accomplished to some
extent by direct enquiry, but for the greater
part through the assistance of outside
persons familiar with the neighbourhood,
and possessing either through their duties or
in other ways intimate contact with individual members of it over a period of more
than the past 20 years.

treatment itself requires some explanation.
The former point is therefore dealt with in
the attached Tables I and III, from which it
may be noted that the average ages of the
groups concerned work out as Coloured males
9:5 years, Coloured females 8-9 years, White
males 9g years, and White females 9-1
years. It will also be gathered that although

the period between the lowest and the highest
age-group is extensive in terms of growth
there is a certain though not complete
degree of uniformity in the respective agespreads. Nevertheless, these facts obviously
mitigate against the possibilities of purely
conventional treatment, and, as already
suggested, demand that the present results
must be regarded mainly as a basis for further
material. In consequence, the statistical
analysis which follows is not intended to
provide more than an indication of a number
of formulations or perhaps tendencies which
may or may not be substantiated by further
exploration. For example, although Means
of direct measurements are provided for all
the characters concerned, they offer for the
most part a comparison of traits merely in
terms of the present samples. A slightly
higher degree of validity may of course be
accorded to the indices, more particularly the

cephalic index, since expressed in proportionate terms growth constitutes a less variable
factor. For comparative purposes therefore,
constants have been limited to the various
head, face, nasal, etc., ratios, and with the
possible exception of the cephalic index it
will be noted that they display a somewhat
high degree of variability, which, as might be
expected, is most pronounced where fleshy
rather than bony parts of the skull are
concerned. See Table IJ. On the actual
showing of standard deviations and standard
errors there is apparently little difference to
be observed as far as the relevant indices are
concerned between the respective samples of
White and Coloured. The only character
which shows any appreciable difference in
this respect is the cephalic index in the case
of the male comparisons, where the White
sigma is significantly smaller, and in the case
of the fronto-jugal index of the females,

where the White sigma again is significantly
smaller. Bearing in mind, however, the
composition of the sample it would be
unwise to attach importance on statistical
grounds to this.

Significant Traits

Means of direct measurements and observations selected for their significance on
racial grounds are shown on Table III, and
to amplify their implication further the
various male sub-divisions are depicted
graphically on the attached figures. Along
with these are included the more modifiable,
and hence less racially valid features of
stature and weight, whose presence here may
be justified on the grounds of the environmental identity of the background of both
samples. Speaking generally, this closer
analysis of nasal, lip, skin colour, etc., bears
out what in terms of genetical theory might
be expected. The only noteworthy exception
to the rule of ascending nasal ratio with

a»

bilities of error in the selection of the former
may be invoked. On the other hand this same
apparent discrepancy does not recur to any
significant extent in the other traits to which
the same type of comparison has been
applied. [See Figs. 1-4.]

The “ Means” shown for Hair, Eye and
Skin colour require comment in so far as any
attempt to afford quantitativity to mainly
qualitative characters obviously calls for
caution.f In this case, both the initial
estimation and the comparison have been

throughout both groups is shown on Table
IIIa, the frequencies being expressed in percentage terms. From this it will be gathered
that the respective modal shades of Hair are
light brown for the Whites and dark brown
for the Coloured, the White females showing
a slightly wider range. In the case of eye
pigmentation the modal shade in the case of
the Coloured is very clearly full brown ; the
Whites on the other hand show a fairly even
spread all the way from blue to full brown,
the females being slightly darker-eyed than
the males.

Both Stature/Age and Weight/Age ratios
have similarly been computed on the basis
of group Means, and here, discounting some
potential inconsistencies owing to the respective age-distributions, the Coloured sample
for either sex, as will be gathered from the
relevant constants; shows signs of increased
development over the White. Further interesting points, allowing for the possibilities of
statistical inadequacy, is the indication of
“hybrid vigour” displayed by the FI
sample, and the increased development of
the females of both groups over the males.

Other Features

In the course of the examination observations were made also on a number of other
more general features, including the condition of the teeth. It was decided to grade
this according to three categories: namely,
I—excellent condition, i.e. no signs of disease
and absence of extractions ; [I—one or two
teeth extracted or showing some signs of
disease ; III—a definitely larger number of
extractions or decayed and diseased teeth.
The results of this inspection are shown on —
Table V, both sexes taken together. Here,
the point of interest is the high percentage
of the NNW group graded in I. The Coloured
sample as a whole shows up slightly better
than the White. Dental anomalies were infrequent, and consisted of only three cases of

two cases occurred amongst Coloured subjects. There were a few cases of lobeless ears
amongst both White and Coloured and one

pigmented shades. No examples of the

As a final consideration the question of
comparative growth is of importance, and, as
quite numerous data on the subject of weight
and stature in children in this country are
available, 1s amenable to wide treatment.
Having regard, however, to the difficulties of
effecting reasonable comparison on racial
lines outside the immediate environment, it
was decided to restrict further consideration
to as similar a milieu as possible. Accordingly
a study made by G. P. Cathcart and A. M. T.
Murray in 1928 on 245 children drawn from
a wide selection of Cardiff working-class
families* was utilized, and in order to re

weight and height “‘ compares very favourably with

and with the more limited body of figures supplied

as group Means on the basis of the distributions of the Coloured and White samples of
the present enquiry. The results are shown
on Table VI, the ‘‘ Cardiff ’”’ sample displaying its highest ratio on the basis of the White
sample. Once again, it will be observed that
the Coloured show up more strongly than
those of ‘‘indigenous”’ stock, particularly
in the Height ratio, where apparently the
difference is accounted for mainly by the
increased size of the Coloured females.

measurements, length and breadth of head,
facial height, etc., etc., are any indication it
would appear as if the mixture of the two
racial stocks and the addition of further
Negroid genes has increased the size of most
of the physical characters compared in the
resultant population. In as much as racially
speaking the Negroid Means for these
characters are invariably smaller than the
“ British ”’ or Caucasoid Means in general,*

this point is of further interest, and here

An Introduction to Modern Genetics. ‘‘ On crossing two
different varieties or inbred strains, the effects of the
recessive genes of one plant are hidden by the dominant
allelomorphs of the other, and perfectly healthy plants
result. The phenomenon is known as heterosis, or
hybrid vigour. The effect usually disappears in generations later than the F1.... Pp. 317 et seg. For further

ignored despite the varying extent of the
genetic factors involved. As far as segregation is concerned, expressed of course in
group terms, the influence of additional
Negroid ancestry appears generally speaking
to produce results well in accordance with
orthodox genetical principles. 
On the subject of the variability of the
respective groups little can as yet be said,
and this question along with our general
suggestions may be left for the present to the
test of more complete material, which, it 1s
hoped, will presently be forthcoming.

 

In connection with the above I should like
first of all to thank the Royal Society for
their assistance towards this investigation in
the shape of a Government Grant. My sincere
thanks are due also to a number of people in
Cardiff and elsewhere whom I may be excused
from mentioning by name, but who have
given me very material aid in arranging for
this work. More particularly, I must thank
Mr. W. J. Williams, Director of Education, and
Dr. Phillips, Deputy Medical Superintendent

in Cardiff, the Rev. Stanley Watson, Mr.

B. H. Morgan, Headmaster of South Church
Street School and his Staff, and also my wife
for their assistance in this connection, and
last but not least the subjects themselves,
whose admirable patience throughout made
possible the taking of a large number of
delicate measurements and observations.
