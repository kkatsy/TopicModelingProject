THE GERMAN STERILIZATION ACT OF 1933:

‘‘Gesetz zur Verhutung erbkranken Nachwuchses’”’
By HANS HARMSEN

Director of the School of Public Health at Hamburg.

S a result of the war, most of the
documents dealing with the carrying
out of eugenic legislation in Germany

are lost. The total number of eugenic sterili
zations between 1934 and 1945 can therefore
only be estimated. Giirtner, the Attorney
General at that time, has stated that 62,463 
persons were sterilized in 1934 and that the
number was as high as 71,760 in 1935. Since
1936, however, there has been a considerable
decrease in the number of proceedings
brought before the Erbgesundheitsgerichte.
A “‘ Central Association of Sterilized
Persons,’ constituted after 1945 with a view
to financial indemnification, maintained
that in twelve years the total number of
sterilizations amounted to two million.
Lenz, however, maintains that not more
than 350,000 sterilization operations were
performed. From 1934 to 1945, in the
Hamburg-Altona district, 18,987 sterilization
proceedings were held and 15,816 decrees for
sterilization were made. In Hamburg the
most rigorous standard was applied; based

on the Hamburg rate, the number of steriliza
tions would amount to nearly 300,000, but
the real number may be about 200,000 to
250,000. But even this exceeds by far the
total number of sterilizations: in all other
countries of the world since the enactment
in 1907 of the first sterilization law in the
American state of Indiana. What is the
moral of the praxis and the handling of
sterilizations in Germany ?

The History of Eugenic Sterilization

The first sterilization against the passing
on of a hereditary taint was carried out as
early as 1897, when the gynecologist
Kehrer of Heidelberg operated on a married
woman, who had borne several idiotic and
feeble-minded children. A draft law to

enforce sterilizations for eugenic reasons was
submitted to the German Reichstag in
1925. In the discussion in 1927 of the
amendment to the German Criminal Code
it was agreed that sterilization on medical
grounds should no longer be considered as a
personal injury. A eugenically or socially
indicated sterilization, performed with the
consent of the injured person, should be
liable to prosecution only if violating ‘‘ good
manners and customs.” Before 1933, sterilizations of minors and adults were performed
in Germany with the explicit consent of
the Court of Chancery and if the costs were
paid by public authorities. The total
number, however, has been very small.
An inquiry in ninety-five cities of more than
50,000 inhabitants, carried out in 1930 by
Fetscher of Dresden, showed that there
were only 112 sterilized persons: eightythree women had been sterilized on medical
grounds ! Only eighteen women and eleven
men were sterilized for eugenic reasons.
Up to 1932 Fetscher himself operated on
sixty-five persons in Dresden for eugenic
reasons ; Klose, between 1929 and 1932,
on twenty-one persons in Kiel, nineteen
of these on account of congenital imbecility.

On July r4th, 1933, the ‘‘ Gesetz zur
Verhiitung erbkranken Nachwuchses ”’ (Act
for Averting Descendants afflicted with
Hereditary Disease) permitted the sterilization of those persons who could be confidently
expected to transmit serious physical or
mental defects to their descendants. Among
the conditions mentioned were: congenital
imbecility, schizophrenia, manic-depressive
insanity, hereditary falling sickness
(epilepsy), hereditary St. Vitus’s dance
(Huntington’s chorea), hereditary deafness
or blindness, serious physical deformities
and chronic alcoholism.

. The application for sterilization could be
made by the patient himself, or, with the
approval of the Court of Chancery, by his
legal representative, or by the local public
health officer. If the person was a patient
in a hospital, sanatorium or asylum, the
director of the institution was authorized
to apply for sterilization. |Erbgesundheitsgerichte, which were annexed to a
District Court, made the preliminary
decisions, against which a protest could be
lodged within two weeks. The final decision
was made by Erbgesundheitsgericht annexed

to the Provincial Court of Appeal. Decrees

could then be carried out without the consent of the person to be sterilized. After
the war, records of some cases gave the
impression that the law had been misused
against political enemies.

After the war, unlike other Nazi laws,
the Act “ zur Verhtitung erbkranken Nachwuchses ”’ was not rescinded by the Control
Commission of Germany (C.C.G.). New
boards of the Erbgesundheitsgerichte, however, have not been constituted and therefore
no use is made of the Act.

Some of the Lander rescinded the whole
Act or parts of it; in some instances only
the rules concerning the interruption of
pregnancy are still in force. The legal
uncertainty in the field of eugenics, which
was created after the war, calls very urgently
for a change.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

The order of July 28th, 1947, enacted
by the British Zone’s Central Board of
Justice, dealing with the reopening of
proceedings in Erbgesundheitssachen, was
followed by a report of those proceedings
up to 1945. The claims for financial compensation for the enacted sterilizations
were decided upon under another body—
the compensation legislation for victims
of the Nazi Government—but the reopened
cases were very informative in many other
respects. In addition, I asked my students
of the Akademie fiir Staatsmedezin in
Hamburg to examine the documents on
the carrying out of the Erbgesundheitsgesetz in representative urban and rural
zones. The results obtained by these public
health officers have been collected: in a
series of papers. In all these investigations
there was no evidence that any reasons other
than eugenic ones influenced the handling
of the proceedings. The improper political
misuse mentioned above seems to have
occurred only to a very insignificant extent,
but that it should have occurred at all is a
most regrettable fact.

Grounds for Sterilization
/ Our investigations give a reliable frequency
/ distribution of conditions leading to steriliza(tion. Congenital imbecility, schizophrenia
\and hereditary epilepsy added up to 85 per
cent and constituted the chief reasons for

the operations.

THE GERMAN STERILIZATION ACT OF 1933

In general, sterilizations were performed
in equal numbers on both sexes. In Hamburg, 8,559 out of 15,816 sterilizations were
carried out on men, 7,257 on women.
Sterilizations for congenital imbecility were
performed more frequently on _ females,
those for chronic alcoholism more frequently
on males. The distribution of hereditary
conditions leading to sterilization in several
large psychiatric hospitals is also rather
informative :

229

rejecting a sterilization on account of
“social proof’ likewise shows precision
in handling the law. By bringing a case to
the Erbgesundheitsobergerichte as the higher
court, which was done fairly frequently, local
influence could be avoided and new scientific
knowledge could be taken into account.

An edict of the Department of the Interior,
dated September 13th, 1939, ordered that
medical health officers should not apply
for sterilization if pregnancy was improbable

The institutions named in Table 2 show
typical differences. The Landes- und Provinzial-Heil- und Pflegeanstalten (State and
county hospitals) deal mostly with schizophrenia, while epileptic cases predominate in
Bethel, a typical charity hospital. Two-thirds
of all sterilizations were carried out between

1934 and 1936.

With regard to so-called serious physical
deformities, Harmsen showed in 1935 that
sufferers from congenital dislocation of the
hip were on the whole quite talented and
socially valuable people. In this group,
therefore, as Smidt showed in 1953, numerous
applications were rejected, if they were put
at all. In 1936 Harmsen pointed out that
the question of the seriousness of imbecility
in relation to social aptitude resulted in
frequent demands for revision at Erbgesundheitsobergerichte. The rather high proportion of decisions of the superior court

(e.g. with women in the climacteric, or
women who had for several years lived in
childless matrimony), if the diagnosis was
not clear or in borderline cases. The circular
of April 8th, 1943, brought a further restriction, instructing the medical officers to put
fn applications only in cases where the
diagnosis was absolutely clear and a classic
form of development could be expected, or
if the case could be indisputably diagnosed
as a hereditary affliction. More than ever,
judgment should be based on _ practical
genetics and on social adjustment.

Analysis of Reopened Cases

While 15,816 sterilization decisions had
been, closed from 1934 to 1945 in Hamburg,
the reopening edict of 1947 was followed
by 458 demands for revision leading to new
proceedings between 1947 and 1952. Traenkner and Bonhoff carefully analysed the
investigations of these reopened cases. For
the evaluation of their findings it is important
to note that these reopened cases, representing about one in thirty-five of the
original material, coincide with the “ old
proceedings ”’ as to sex and age distribution
as well as in their diagnostic sub-groups.
230

Nevertheless, the 664 applicants (4:2 per
cent of sterilized persons) may very well
represent a certain amount of self-selection.

The re-trials in Erbgesundheitsangelegenheiten confirmed the demand for the special
consideration of social aptitude and social
adjustment in a very instructive manner.
In the re-trial proceedings, two-thirds of
the former sterilization decisions were
quashed—preponderantly those on women.
In the imbecility group, representing 74 per
cent of all the re-trial cases, the revised
judgments were preponderantly on persons
sterilized before their twenty-fifth year,
whose prognoses had obviously been put
too unfavourably. Above all, the importance
of poor environmental influences in adolescence and infancy (dipsomania or alcoholism
of one or both parents, illegitimate birth,
early divorce of the parents, early loss of
parents, etc.) had certainly been underestimated.

A survey of women sterilized in Kiel,
published by Felicitas Klose in 1938, showed
that 82 per cent of the sterilized women led
normally moral lives ; 4-8 per cent continued
their immoral lives; 2:8 per cent were
sexually promiscuous before the operation ;
7-6 per cent seemed to be endangered by
extraordinary sensual desires ; 1-9 per cent,
however, did become more stable and homeloving ; 0-9 per cent had no sexual inclinations. A summary states that sterilization
did not further a sliding off into prostitution.
Beukert, too, conducting his investigations
at Bochum, stated that he found no cases of
sterilized women (including imbeciles) turning to prostitution and promiscuity.

Regarding social adjustment, only onequarter of all cases of imbecility proved to be
a burden on society, and very few cases
could be considered a severe burden. People
with a slight or medium degree of imbecility
were often made to feel relatively secure in
times of economic crisis by frequently changing their place of work! Thus, the value of
sterilization in such cases of imbecility
appears to be very doubtful. This seems to
be particularly true in cases of early sterilization (before the age of twenty), and taking

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

into account social adjustment, which may
be relatively good. |

Large Asocial Families

The total significance of large asocial
families with slight imbecility, although
they are often the cause of concern to social
welfare workers, is usually overestimated.
Among thirty-seven unmarried mothers
sterilized at Kiel there was one with nine
children, but these thirty-seven unmarried
mothers had only fifty-nine children between
them, i.e. an average of roughly 1-6. The
fringe of this. group of imbecile persons,
especially the prostitutes, rarely had a
higher number of children. The revision of
the Hamburg Erbgesundheitsverfahren
(1952) showed that of all those who were
sterilized for imbecility at an age of over
twenty years, less than one-third had had

even one child. The average number of

children of those sterilized between their
twentieth and thirtieth years was 0:36. Cases
sterilized on account of severe alcoholism
had an average of 1:4 children; most of these
people were over thirty, 50 per cent were
over forty. There is a similar low reproduction rate in other groups of people with
hereditary afflictions. Schizophrenics, for
instance, whose mortality rate is three
times higher than the average, have a
fecundity of one-quarter to two-thirds of
the rest of the population.

Schizophrenia and Epilepsy

In the schizophrenic group, 50 per cent
of the former decisions were quashed. This
may be because of recent research in schizophrenia, according to which a certain
diagnosis is possible only if there is also
mental defect.

Re-investigation of the epilepsy group
very often resulted in quashing former
decisions, depending more upon the degree
of the socio-psychic effect of the disease
than upon the diagnosis. In this connection
it may be noted that Sioli, according to
Schréder, could verify only fifty-four out
of 200 cases of alleged epilepsy as being
hereditary.
' THE GERMAN STERILIZATION ACT OF 1933

*¢ Phdnokopien ”’

In 1933 .Richard Goldschmidt observed
for the first time the existence of nonhereditary conditions which he called
‘‘ Phanokopien.”’ Such ‘‘ Phanokopien, ”’
occur not only in animals but also in
humans—as, for instance, serious bodily
deformities of new-born babies after the
infection of the mother with German measles
in the first four months of pregnancy. As
Nachtsheim points out, the possibility of
these “‘ Phanokopien”’ calls for a detailed
and exact differential-diagnosis and examination of family histories on the question as
to whether a hereditary disease really exists.

Genetics and Sterilization

Experience of the German law of 1933
for preventing the transmission of hereditary
disease, and progress in human genetics, has
proved that the danger of passing on hereditary taints has often been overestimated.
While it is true that research in twins confirms the importance of hereditary factors,
the varying ways in which a disease may
develop encourages therapeutic measures.
Only a few genetic traits have such a strong
(dominant) genetic force as to demand a
renunciation of children. Moreover it must
be remembered that many hereditary diseases eliminate themselves by non-marriage
or by a very small number of children.

Sterilization seems in the main to be
indicated for individuals who suffer from a
hereditary disease who want the operation
for personal reasons or out of consideration
for their partner in matrimony or their
possible descendants. Sterilization may also
be. wanted within the family after serious
hereditary infirmities in children have
occurred. Although a helpless member of a
family may be regarded as a challenge,
and as the permanent object of loving care,
there are limits to spiritual strength which

seems to justify a sterilizing operation..

At the present time, lack of uniformity in
the sterilization laws, coupled with the
non-existence of a superior court to which
decisions could be referred, has resulted in
no operations being performed, not even in
cases where sterilization is eugenically

231

desirable. On the other hand, it is my
opinion that many healthy women are
sterilized as a birth-control measure.

Generally, the consequences of negative
eugenic measures by the State on a people’s
entire genetic substance cannot be overlooked. Experience up to 1945 proves that
disregard of life, of human individuality
and personality must result in the destruction
of people and community.

The encouragement of the healthy and
efficient family is still the best way for a
qualitative policy of population.
