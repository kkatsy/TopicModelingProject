The Robbins Report

“Are there enough pupils of ability to justify University expansion without lowering of standards ?”’

HERE ARE MANY eminent organizations,

like The Times, which appear to want to

prevent the expansion of the universities
by trying to cast doubt on the arguments and
statistics produced by Robbins. I cannot claim
to provide more than another illustration of the
facts, but this may be of interest because the
original research was published in THE EUGENICS
REVIEW ten years ago.

After testing the intelligence of schoolboys
at Winchester College from 1945 onwards, I
published a comparison of their IQs with those
of a number of other schools.} Includedin this
comparison were eighty-five boys of agefourteen
who were tested on Cattell Scale IIIA in July
1952 at Watford Boys Grammar School (identified as a ‘““Home Counties G.S.”). I have now
been able to discover how many of these boys
went to universities, and to compare their
numbers, at equal levels of intelligence quotient,
with those from Winchester College who went
on to university. The data for the latter are
published in Winchester College, A Register for
the Years 1901-1946, edited by E. R. Wilson
and H. A. Jackson.{ This latest comparison is
very illuminating.

Thus, at every level of intelligence, a boy from
Winchester stood a far greater chance of entering
a university than a boy from Watford. For boys
at Winchester with a Cattell I.Q. of 150 upwards,
the majority went to university; but not till a
Cattell I.Q. of 170 was reached did the majority
of Watford boys go there.

Even if one allows for the differing proportion
of boys with high I.Q.s at the two schools, it is
clear that, if the Watford boys had had the
Winchester chances, far more would have gone
to university:

1.Q. < 149 35% of 27 i.e. 9

1Q. 150-9 70% of 13 ie. 9

IQ. 160-9 60% of 16ie. 9

IQ. 170 84% of 29 i.e. 24
upwards

TOTAL 51

Thus fifty-one Watford boys (instead of only
twenty-one) would have gone to university if
they had had the same chances as the boys from
Winchester.

It is possible to argue that the comparison is
not as rigorous as could be desired, on three
grounds:

1. Dates. It would have been better to have a
Winchester sample of boys aged fourteen in
1952; but the numbers of university entrants
are not available and it is extremely unlikely
that the Winchester proportion going to university would be less. The true comparison
would probably show an even higher Winchester/
Watford ratio.

2. I.Q.s. No one, especially nowadays, would
judge anyone on one I.Q. alone. But supposing
that anyone had failed to do themselves justice
and had thus been grouped in a low I.Q. range,
I would expect it to be a Watford boy from a
less favoured home background rather than one
from Winchester with his greater verbal sophistication. A really fair comparison of inborn

ability would thus also be more likely to show
an even higher Winchester/Watford ratio.

3. Which Universities ? For the Watford pupils,
any institution leading to a degree has been
counted as a university whereas, of the pupils
who entered Winchester in 1945-6, sixty-three
out of sixty-four went to either Oxford or
Cambridge. Few people would care to argue
(even in The Times?) that admission standards
at Oxford and Cambridge were Jower than
elsewhere, and that the “real”? Winchester/
Watford ratio would not be even higher.

Conclusion
I think that, from the data given, the pro
28

portion of the population going to universities
could be doubled at least without danger of
their being too little inborn talent to equal the
present levels of ability of university entrants.

The real danger is that the Government, by
first cutting the university grants a few years
ago and now failing to provide the necessary
money sufficiently rapidly, will prevent 25,000
pupils of university ability from obtaining
places in 1965 merely because they were born
in a year with a high birth rate.

I am indebted to the past and present Headmasters of Watford Boys Grammar School
(Professor H. A. Rée and Mr. L. K. Turner) for
their help.
