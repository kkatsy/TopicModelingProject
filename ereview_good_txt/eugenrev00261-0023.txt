ESTIMATES OF FUTURE POPULATIONS OF
VARIOUS COUNTRIES"
By D. V. GLASS

HE object of this brief collection of

statistics and notes is to provide some

basis for discussion of possible trends
of population in the next forty years. The
data cover sets of twenty-eight estimates,
mainly published after 1930, showing a wide
range of hypotheses and methods of calculation. None of the estimates, however, takes
into account the possible effects of war. The
commentaries give a resumé of methodology
and hypotheses, and the reader may thus
judge the relative merits of the various
estimates. The appended tables summarize
the results, in terms of total populations,
as far as the year 1980. Many of the estimates were continued far beyond that
point, but estimates are ephemeral (save for
theoretical discussion) and the population
data for subsequent years have not been
given. The annotations indicate, however,
the ultimate points of time to which the
computations were originally taken. Where
estimates are based on more than one set
of hypotheses, the alternative results are
given. The range between the “ most
pessimistic ’’ and the “most optimistic ”
results is in some way a measure of the
margin of indeterminateness involved in
such calculations and an indication of the
danger of regarding estimates as if they
were prophecies. In the tables, the estimated
future populations are accompanied by
statistics of actual populations for the years
for which they are available.

* This material was originally prepared as an
Appendix to Population Policies and Movements
(Oxford University Press, 1940), but was omitted for
lack of space. No substantial changes have been made
in the presentation, save to exclude the data on the
United States and on Japan. It is hoped, however, to

deal with these countries later, and also to publish a
discussion of estimates and estimation in general.

2nd estimate.—Extrapolation of recent
-trends—gross reproduction rate assumed to

fall to 0.259 by 1980-5 (assuming that the
fertility of women aged 15-19 would remain
constant ; a decrease of 5 per cent every five
years for women aged 20-4, a 15 per cent fall
every five years for women aged 25-39, and
a 25 per cent fall every five years for women
aged 40-9 years), and the expectations of
life at birth to rise by 1965 to 68.3 years for
males and 71.1 years for females (assuming
mortality rates would fall by 20 per cent
every five years for persons under one year
of age, by 10 per cent every five years for
the age groups between 1 and 70, and no
change in the older ages).. After these dates,
fertility and mortality are assumed constant.

3rd estimate.—Fertility of 1931 assumed
to apply constantly—gross reproduction
rate of 0.930. Mortality assumed to fall by
the same extent as in the second estimate,
but within fifteen years.

Migration was excluded from all estimates.
The first and second estimates were computed by single years of age up to 1965, and
beyond that by the quinquennial method.
The third estimate was computed throughout
by the quinquennial method. The results are
given for January Ist of each year, for the
first and second estimates, up to 1945, and
then for 1950, 1955, 1960 and 1965. Subsequent figures for 1970 to 2035 are in five-year
age groups and for each five-year point of
time. This latter method is used throughout
for the third estimate. Specific fertility rates
in all estimates were obtained by the indirect
method from Swedish data.

[3] Wilson, N. ‘Expected Population
Changes and Their Effect upon Social
Services.” Institute of Public Administration, London, 1935.

The estimate assumes that the annual
number of births continues at the 1933 level
up to 1937; from 1938-42, a fall of 3 per
cent per year ; from 1943-52, a fall of x per
cent per year; from 1953-7, a fall of 2 per
cent per year; and from 1958-62, a fall of
I per cent per year. For mortality, infants
and adults aged 15 to 29 years were treated
separately. For 1937-41 the death rate of
infants under 2 years was assumed to be

go per cent of the 1930-3 rate, and for infants
aged 2 to 4 years 85 per cent of the relevant
rate. For 1942-6 the rate for infants under
I was assumed to be go per cent of the
1937 rate; 95 per cent for infants aged I
year ; and unchanged for infants aged 2 to
4 years. For 1947-51, the death rate for
infants under I year was assumed to fall
by 5 per cent from the 1942 level, and other
groups remained unchanged. For the special
groups of adults, an improvement was
assumed to take place in 1952 (due to a
reduction in tuberculosis mortality) and
thereafter to remain unchanged. No specific
assumptions are given for the later age
groups, but the mortality appears to be
slightly below the average of 1923-32.
Migration was not taken into account.
The computation appears to have been
by five-year age groups from 5 to 49
years and for single years of age for o to 4
and over 49 years of age. The persons aged
80 and over are dealt with in one group and
assumed to be 40 per cent of the group 75-9
years five years previously. Results are
given by sex and age (single years up to five
and then by five-year age groups) for fiveyear time intervals from 1932 to 1962.

[4] Glass, D. V. ‘‘ Estimates of the ‘ future
population ’ of England and Wales,”
in Population Policies and Movements
in Europe, Oxford, 1940, pp. 355-60.

The estimates are based upon three sets
of hypotheses.

1. Estimate I assumes the continuance of
the fertility and mortality of 1935. Life
tables constructed for that year show an
expectation of life at birth of 60.47 years for
males and 64.50 years for females. The
estimated net reproduction rate for that
year—computed by the indirect method—
is 0.764. Migration is excluded.

2. Estimate II assumes the same fertility
and mortality as Estimate I, but, in addition, a net immigration of 500,000 persons
every five years from 1940. These immigrants have been distributed by age and sex
in a way similar to the distribution of
emigrants from the United Kingdom in
recent years. It is assumed that the immigrants exhibit the same fertility and morESTIMATES OF FUTURE POPULATIONS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES = 73

tality as the population of England and
Wales in 1935. :

3. Estimate III extrapolates recent trends
in fertility and mortality, assuming that
fertility ceases to fall by 1960 and mortality
by 1970. In extrapolating mortality, the
generation method was taken into account,
leading to ultimate expectations of life at
birth of 67.67 years for males and 70.15
years for females for 1970 and subsequent
years. In extrapolating specific fertility
rates (estimated), the diagonal fall by age
shown in many countries was taken into
account, the fall being thus assumed to be
greater with each successive older age group.
The ultimate assumed gross reproduction
rate is 0.600 for 1970 and subsequent years.
Mortality is assumed to fall until 1970, so
the net reproduction rate, which is 0.559 in
1960-5, is 0.563 in 1965-70 and 0.566 from
1970 outwards. Migration is excluded. Computation is by five-year age groups, using
survival ratios constructed from the life
table populations. Births are computed by
applying the assumed specific fertility rates
to the average numbers of women in each of
the seven five-year age groups of the reproductive period in each quinquennium. The
resultant population data are by five-year
age groups for five-year time intervals (midyear figures), calculated originally beyond
the year 2000 in all cases for reasons of
theoretical interest.

trends in fertility and mortality upon
the future population of Scotland and

Ist estimate.—Continuation of the fertility
of 1934 and the mortality of 1933 (mean
expectation of life at birth of 56.66 years
for males and 60.32 years for females)—gross
reproduction rate of 1.098, and net reproduction rate of 0.912.

regards the fall in fertility and mortality as
for England and Wales, second estimate.

Migration was excluded from both estimates. Both estimates were computed by

The population of Scotland was estimated

but the same methods and assumptions were
made in both cases. Legitimate and illegitimate general fertility rates were extrapolated by fitting straight lines to the data
from 1924-31, but assuming that they would
stabilize at the levels reached in 1944. The

years was estimated by fitting a straight line
to the proportions which married women
formed of all women in the same age group
in the years 1924-31, but assuming that
stability was maintained at the level reached
by 1944. Mortality is apparently at the
1924-32 level. Computation appears to have
been by single years of age from 0 to 4 years,
for a single age group above 80 years, and by
a quinquennial method for the intermediate
years of age. The results are given in broad
age groups, separately for males and females
and for the two countries, by five-year time
intervals from 1931 to 1956, and by ten-year
time intervals from 1956 to 1976.

[8] Honey, F. J. C. ‘‘ The estimated
population of Great Britain, 1941-71,”
Journal of the Institute of Actuantes,
1937, PP. 323-47.

Births at pivotal years—1g4I, I95I, 1961
and 197I1—were estimated by an extrapolation of the Registrar General’s fertility rates
for 1921 and 1931—the trend was assumed
to be a fall every five years in geometric progression, in the ratio which the 1931 rates
bore to rates estimated for 1926, the rates
for Scotland according to age being proportionate to those for England and Wales.
Illegitimate and legitimate births were dealt
with separately but by the same method.
Births for the pivotal years stated were computed by applying the estimated legitimate
and, illegitimate fertility rates to the subsequent populations of married and unmarried
women. The married populations were ob
tained by applying the 1931 percentages of
married women by age groups to the estimated future population, and then deriving
the numbers of married men according to age
on the basis of the 1931 position. The 1931
age distribution of wives was then applied to
these men and a second estimate of married
women obtained. The average of these two

’ estimates was used.~ The births in the inter
pivotal years were obtained by interpolation.
Mortality (in the form of survival factors)

-was estimated by fitting curves to the data

of the English Life Tables, Nos. 6-10, with
slight modifications based on the Scottish
differences in 1931. Infant mortality was
dealt with separately. The assumed expectations of life in 1971 were 62.0 years for males
and 66.0 years for females, and the final net
reproduction rate was 0.42. Migration was
excluded. Computation (except for the ages
o to 9 years) was by a quinquennial method.
The results are given in five-year age groups,
separately for males and females, and by
ten-year intervals of time, from 1931 to 1971.

Wales and Scotland, in Royal Commtssion on the Distribution of the Industrial
Population, Report, Cmd. 6153, London,

Population in Great Britain, London,
1942, Cmd. 6358.

Estimates are constructed on three sets of
assumptions.

1. Assumes fertility will continue at its
“ present level,’ that mortality ‘ will continue to fall,’ that there will be net inward
migration until 1941-51 and no migration
afterwards. This is the ‘‘ standard ”’ estimate.

z. Assumes the ultimate fertility reached
in 1971 will be ro per cent higher and the
ultimate mortality 10 per cent-lower than
that postulated in the first estimate.

3. Assumes the ultimate “fertility reached
will-be ro per cent lower and the ultimate
mortality ro per cent higher than in the first
estimate.

For the first estimate the results are given
by broad age groups at ten-year time intervals from 1941 to I971, sex being distinESTIMATES OF FUTURE POPULATIONS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES = 75

guished only for certain age groups. For the
other estimates, only the total populations
can be obtained (by means of deviations from
the first estimate).

as for second estimate.

Computation was by five-year age groups,
but the results are given only for broad age
groupings, distinguishing the sexes. The
results are given for every tenth year up to

Assumes that the mortality shown by the
Netherlands life tables for males, 1930, will
constantly apply to the total Belgian population. Does not calculate fertility rates but
estimates annual births in the following way :
From the births in 1901-36, calculates the
survivors twenty-five years later by applying
a survival quotient; divides by 2.2 to
obtain marriages of these survivors ; multiplies result by two to estimate births to these
marriages, and thus obtains births from 1936
to 1961-5. The same method is then applied
to yield births until 1995. Life table factors
are applied to births and living population
to compute future populations. Migration
is not taken into account. Results are given
in five-year age groups (males and females
combined) at five-year intervals of time from
1930 to 1995.

[14] Glass, D. V.. ‘“‘ Estimates of the
future population of Belgium.’’ Some
results cited in Population Polictes
and Movements, p. 156, but not
otherwise published.

The estimates are based upon two sets of

assumptions.

Ist estimate.—Assumes the continuance of

the mortality of 1934-5, and an annual supply
of births at the average of 1934-5. That is,
an ultimately stationary population is implied.

and estimate——Assumes the same mortality as the first estimate, and that fertility
continues at the level of 1934-5, that is
assuming a constant gross reproduction rate
of 0.929 and a constant net reproduction
rate of 0.802.

Migration is excluded from both estimates.
Both estimates are computed by means of
survival ratios derived from life tables
constructed for 1934-5, and the specific
fertility rates applied in the second estimate
are obtained by the indirect method. The
initial population on January Ist, 1935, 1s
the de jure population and de jure births and
deaths are therefore used in the calculations.
For the first estimate the results are given
for the total populations; for the second
they are given by five-year age groups and
for five-year periods of time (January Ist of
each year) from 1935 to the year 2000.

jusqu’en 1956,” Journal de la Socwété
de Statistique de Paris, 1928, pp. 321-7,
and 1929, pp. 8-13.

Assumes the mortality of the life table for
1920-3 (giving a mean expectation of life at
birth of 52.19 years for males and 56.09
years for females) and current fertility rates
(slightly below those for 1920-4), giving a
gross reproduction rate of 1.14. Migration 1s
excluded. Beginning with January Ist, 1927,
populations are given by five-year age groups,
males and females distinguished, for the
beginning of each year up to 1956. Populations in similar age groups are also given for
each year from 1921 to 1927.

sur la population frangaise jusqu’en
1980,” Journal de la Socrété de Statistique de Paris, 1932, pp. 319-37.

Ist estimate.—Mortality : assumes 50 per
cent fallin thirty years for children under one
year of age; 20 per cent fall for persons
aged 1 to 59 years; no change for persons
aged 60 years and over. Mortality remains
stationary after the thirty years. Fertility is
held constant at the rates current in recent

years (apparently obtained by applying the
specific fertility rates of 1925-7, but reducing
them so that the number of births computed
for 1931 equalled the average of the actual
births in 1929-30).

2nd estimate.—Mortality as above. Fertility held constant at the rates obtaining in
the Seine département in 1925-7 (but these
fertility rates were not applied until 1931, for
the populations at the beginning of 1929,
1930 and 1931, are the same as in the first
estimate).

The populations of the first estimate are
given by five-year age groups (though apparently calculated by single years of age) for
January ist of each year from 1929 to 1980.
The results of the second estimate are given
for the same points of time, but only in
broad age groups. In both estimates males
and familes are distinguished. Migration is
excluded from both estimates.

[x17] Sauvy, A. “‘ Perspectives statistiques
sur la population, l’enseignement et le
chémage,” Journal de la Société de
Statistique de Paris, 1937, pp. 227-41.

Ist estimate.—Fertility held constant at
approximately the level of 1935. (Estimated
by reducing the specific fertility rates of
1930-4 so as to produce the births recorded
in 1935.) Mortality held constant at the
1935 level.

2nd estimate.—Fertility : assumes a constant rate of decline in the specific fertility
rates equal to that observed in the period
1930-5. Mortality : constant rate of decline
equal to the fall shown in the specific age
rates in the previous ten years.

Births appear to have been calculated for
each year, and the rest of the population by
five-year age groups. Migration has not been
taken into account in either estimate. The
results are given by five-year age groups, for
January 1st, at the beginning of each fiveyear period from 1935 to 1985. The sexes
are not distinguished in the published results.

* Including Saar territory.

2nd estimate.—Legitimate fertility remains constant at the level obtaining in
1924-5.

3rd estimate.—Legitimate fertility falls
(with equal falls in each five-year age group
from 20 to 44 years) by 25 per cent between
1924-5 and 1954-5, the fall describing a
parabola of the third order. After 1955
fertility remains constant.

In all three estimates mortality is held
constant at the level of I921-3; and the
annual number of illegitimate live births is
also held constant, apparently at the 1923
level. Migration is not taken into account.

In calculating the number of potentially
fertile married women, the ratio of women
aged 20-39 years to men aged 22-41 years
appears to have been taken into account,
but there is no explicit statement of the
method of estimation. The estimates are
given by five-year age groups, for males and
females separately, at five-year time intervals from 1925 to 1935, and then by ten-year
time intervals to 1975, the results referring
to the beginning of the year.

[19] ‘‘ Ausblick auf die zukiinftige Bevélkerungsentwicklung im Deutschen
Reich,” Statestik des Deutschen Reichs,
Berlin, 1930, 401, II, pp. 641 ff.,
Appendix.

Ist estimate.—Assumes constant annual
supply of live births at the level of 1927
(approximately 1,160,000).

2nd estimate.—Assumes that legitimate and
illegitimate fertility remain at the level of
1927. The numbers of potentially fertile
married women were computed, up to 1940,
by assuming the marriage frequencies of 1910,
and beyond 1940 by using the ratio between
men under 48 years to women under 45 years
of age, though the method is not explicitly
described.

3rd estimate.—Assumes a 25 per cent fall
in legitimate and illegitimate fertility by
1955 and then fertility remains constant.
The fall in fertility is assumed to follow a
curve of the type Q.=ab™. Married women
were estimated in the same way as in the
second estimate. |

In all the above estimates, mortality was
held constant at the level of 1924-6. No
results (apart from graphs) appear to have
been published for the second estimate. For
the first estimate, the results are given by
five-year age groups and separately for males
and females, for single-year intervals of time
to 1955, for five-year intervals to 1980, and
then for ten-year intervals to 2000. The
results of the third estimate are also given by
five-year age groups, but, in addition, by
single years of age for the same time intervals
as the first estimate. The results refer to the
beginning of each year. Note also that the
volume contains estimates, by sex, age (fiveESTIMATES OF FUTURE POPULATIONS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES 79

year groups) and five-year time intervals
from 1920 or 1925 to 1960, of the future
populations of France, Great Britain, Italy,
the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
Poland and the Ukraine. For France it was
assumed that fertility remained at the level
of 1920-4. For the other countries a constant
annual supply of live births was assumed,
equal to those in 1928 for Great Britain,
Italy, the Netherlands, and Denmark, 1927
for Norway and Sweden, and 1929 for the
Ukraine. The choice for Poland is not
stated. Mortality was held constant, being
derived from the following official life tables :
Great Britain, the table for England and
Wales, 1920-2; Italy, 1920-1 table; the
Netherlands, 1gi0-20 table; Sweden,
1g11-20 table; Norway, Ig1I-20 table;
Denmark, 1921-5 table ; Poland, 1922 table
for Posen, Poznan and Pomorze; the
Ukraine, 1925-6 table. The estimates for
France appear to be simply an extension of
Sauvy’s first estimate. Migration is not
taken into account in any of the estimates.

[20] ‘“‘ Die voraussichtliche Bevélkerungs
entwicklung im Deutschen Reich,”
Wirtschaft und Statistik, 1938, pp.
971-5, and 1939, pp. 247-50.

These are two quite separate estimates,
each starting from January Ist, 1938.

1. The first estimate covers Germany
proper (including the Saar) and Austria. In
one graph the Sudetenland is also included,
but there are no statistics for this greater
coverage. As regards mortality, the German
life table for 1932-4 is used as the basis, but
it is assumed that infant mortality will fall
to 40 per 1,000 live births. The fertility
assumption is based on the data of 1936
(marital fertility is apparently calculated
according to age of mother and duration of
marriage), but it is postulated that the
probabiliy of marriage will further increase
to such an extent that the birth deficit
(evidently calculated by the Burgdorfer
method) will be only 7.5 per cent instead
of the 9.6 per cent shown in 1936. These
assumptions apply to Germany proper. For
Austria (for which no separate computations
are given) it is assumed that the German life
table for 1932-4 will apply “‘ very soon,” and

that fertility will follow the same trend as
that in Germany since 1933. Migration is

not taken into account.

2. The second estimate covers Germany
proper, Austria and the Sudetenland, and
is designed to show the course of the population if the supply of births were such as
permanently to yield an annual number of
755,000 boys aged 19 and under 20 years.
The 1932-4 life table is apparently taken as
the basis, and it is postulated that infant
mortality will fall so that whereas the desired
number of youths would have required
1,649,000 live births in 1938, this minimum
number will fall to 1,603,000 by 1953.
Finally, it is assumed that the requisite
annual number of live births for supplying
the contingent of 755,000 youths will be
achieved as from 1943. In that year live
births will amount to 1,630,000 and by 1953
the number will fall to 1,603,000 as infant
mortality falls to 40 per 1,000. Migration is
excluded. There are no separate statistics for
the component parts of the Reich. In both
estimates the results are given for each sex
by five-year age groups up to 60-4 years, and
then in one group for all later ages. The data,
which relate to the beginning of the year, are
given by single-year time intervals up to
1950, and then by five-year time intervals
up to 2000.

Contains a large number of extrapolations
made on various bases—by fitting logistic
curves, exponential curves, rates of growth,
annual numbers of births and deaths—and
estimates based upon various sets of assumptions .as regards fertility, mortality and
emigration. The estimates which are the
most interesting—these are given in the
attached Table 1—are based on three sets of
assumptions :

1. Fertility and mortality constant at the
192i level (mortality derived from the
1921 life table).

2. Fertility falling at the rate shown between 1921 and 1928, mortality constant
at the level of the 1921 life table.

3. Fertility as in 2, and mortality falling
at the rate shown by extrapolations of
the various age groups, with the data
for New Zealand, 1927, regarded as the
ultimate goal, not yet reached (especially
in infant mortality) by 196r.

For each of the above assumptions an
additional calculation was made to show the
effect of an annual loss of 40,000 persons by
emigration (up to 1931 the emigration: loss
was that given by the actual data), but the
mortality and fertility applied to the emigrants was apparently the same for all
estimates. The results of these estimates are
given by sex and in single years of age for
each tenth year from 1921 to 1961 in the case
of estimates I and 2, and for each fifth year
in the case of estimate 3, the populations
relating to the end of the year. Tables relatIng to women aged 15 to 49 years are given
by single years of age and for each year of
time. The results of the estimates which
include the assumed emigration are given
only by broad age groups (male and females
separated) and at ten-year time intervals.

[22] Glass, D. V. -‘ Estimates of the future
population of Italy.”” Some results
are cited in Population Polictes and
Movements, p. 268, but the material
has not otherwise been published.

There are two estimates, taking the census
of 1936, for Italy proper, as the starting
point. The popolazione presente is used, thus
excluding men in Abyssinia at the time, but
this was necessary because the mortality
data given in Movimento della popolazione
are for civil mortality only. The popolazione
presente for males was 20.595 millions. The
Central Statistical Institute also estimated
a popolazione speciale, including men in
Abyssinia, amounting to 21.067 millions.
(See F. Savorgnan, Atti dell’Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni, 1938.)

Two estimates are given :

1. Assumes the mortality of 1935-7 (life
tables constructed for that period show an
expectation of life at birth of 54.62 years for
males and 57.39 years for females) and a
constant annual supply of births at the level
of the average for 1935-7. An ultimately
stationary population is thus assumed.

2. Assumes the same mortality as the
first estimate, and a constant fertility at the
ESTIMATES OF FUTURE POPULATIONS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES 81

level of 1935-7, in which period there was a
gross reproduction rate of 1.425 and a net
reproduction rate of 1.128.

Migration is not taken into account in
either estimate. Computation is by five-year
age groups on the basis of survival ratios
derived from the life tables, specific fertility
rates being used in the second estimate to
obtain the births. For the first estimate the
results are given in total populations ; for
the second by five-year periods of age. For
both estimates the results are given by fiveyear time intervals from 1936 to 1961.

Ist estimate.—Assumes the maintenance

of the specific fertility and specific mortality
rates of 1921-5. Migration is excluded.
2nd estimate.—Assumes the approximate
fertility of 1926-9, and the mortality of
1921-5. As regards migration, assumes that
the net loss by migration in the future in
each age group will be the same proportions
to the populations in the age groups as
obtained in 1921-5. In the calculations,
migration has been counted as mortality and
a life table constructed on that basis.

3rd estimate.—Assumes constant supply

of births at 67,500 per year, apparently the
average for 1927-9. Mortality and migration
are assumed to be at the levels chosen in the
second estimate.

The results are given in totals only (males
and females not separated) at ten-year time
intervals from 1921 to 2001 for the first
estimate, and to 2011 for the second and
third estimates. For the third estimate the
percentage age composition is also given for
1g2I and 2ortI.

The estimate assumes the continuance
(from 1935) of the specific fertility rates of
1930 and of the mortality shown by the
1921-30 life table. Migration is excluded.
The results are given by sex and age (under
I year, I-4 years, and then by five-year age
groups) for the end of each year from 1931
to 1945. The continuation of the estimate to
1960 was made possible through unpublished
data supplied by Dr. J. Backer of the Norwegian Central Statistical Office.

The estimates-are based upon four sets
of assumptions :

1. Extrapolation of the decline of fertility
in recent years, though at a decreasing rate.

2. Assumes the marital and illegitimate
fertility of 1933, with the nuptiality of
IQOI-I0.

3. Assumes the same fertility as in 2, but
nuptiality 25 per cent higher than in 1goI-10
as from 1936.

4. Assumes nuptiality 50 per cent higher
than in 1901-10, the marital fertility of 1933,
and a regular decline in illegitimate fertility
until, from 1956 downwards, it is 50 per cent
below the level of 1933.

Migration is excluded, and all estimates
assume the mortality of 1933. The results
are given by five-year age groups up to 65

and then in one group for the later ages, .

separately for each sex, and by five-year

time intervals (December 31st of the years)
from 1935 to 1985.

Economics, 1939, pp. 41-65.

Beginning from the mid-year European
population for 1935, three estimates are
given, based on various sets of assumptions :

1. Assumes a continuance of the mortality
of 1934-6 (life tables constructed for that
period show a mean expectation of life at
birth of 58.83 years for males and 62.96
years for females) and the fertility of the
same period. That is, the estimate assumes
a continued net reproduction rate of 1.240.

2. Assumes constant mortality at the
level of 1934-6, and a constant annual supply
of births at the absolute level of the 1934-6
average. An ultimately stationary population is thus assumed.

3. Assumes a decline in mortality until
1970, the fall amounting to Io per cent every
five years for the first year of life, and 7 per
cent every five years for the age groups from
I to 69 years. No change in mortality is
assumed for the higher ages. For the fertility
hypothesis, recent trends are extrapolated,
the higher age groups showing a heavier
decline, and the decline ceasing in 1960. The
assumed mean expectations of life at birth
are 66.60 years for males and 69.76 years
for females for 1970 and subsequent years,
while the assumed ultimate net reproduction
rate for 1970 onwards is 0.940. The estimates
ESTIMATES OF FUTURE POPULATIONS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES 83

are computed by the application of survival
ratios derived from life tables and of the
assumed specific fertility rates. Migration is
excluded. For estimate (2) the results are
given in total populations (males and
females separately). For the other estimates
the results are given by five-year age groups
for the separate sexes. The results of the
first two estimates are given by five-year

time intervals up to the year 2035; for the

third they are given up to the year 2000.

Ist estimate.—Fertility and mortality
assumed to remain at 1932-4 level. No
migration.

2nd estimate.—Fertility rises to 1932-4
level by 1938. After 1938, it falls by a
constant rate (the fall in older age groups
being greater than in the younger ones) until
1963, by which point the net reproduction
tate is 0.69. Mortality is the same as in the
first estimate. No migration.

3rd_ estimate.—Fertility and mortality
assumptions as in the second estimate.
Migration assumed to region its pre-depression level from 1938 onwards—27,170 males
and 18,090 females per year, the age and sex

distribution being based on the experience
of June 30th, 1924, to December 31st, 1928.

The. calculations were made by the quinquennial method (except for the ages above
65 years, where the single-year method was
used) and are given in five-year age groups,
separately for males and females, but for
selected years only, fifteen years apart, until
1978, and then for 2033. Total populations
are given at five-year time intervals from
1933 to 2003.

[28] Glass, D. V. ‘‘ Estimates of the future
population of New Zealand.” Unpublished.

Beginning from the European population
(excluding Maoris) on December 3Ist, 1935,
three sets of estimates are given :

r. Assumes continued mortality at the
1935-6 level, showing a mean expectation of
life at birth of 66.17 years for males and
68.89 years for females, and of the fertility
exhibited in the same period—that is, of a
gross reproduction rate of 1.023 and a net
reproduction rate of 0.951.

2. Assumes the same mortality as in the
first estimate, and a constant annual supply
of births at the absolute level of 1935.

3. The recent decline in fertility and
mortality is extrapolated, taking into account
the generation method of observation for
84 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

mortality and the diagonal decline in specific
fertility rates exhibited in most countries.
Fertility is assumed to remain constant from
1961, at a gross reproduction rate of 0.666,
and mortality from 1971, with mean expectations of life at birth of 69.45 years for
males and 71.36 years for females. The net
reproduction rate from 1971 onwards is thus
0.632.

Migration is excluded from all estimates.

The estimates are computed by the application of survival factors derived from the life
tables constructed, and by applying the
assumed specific fertility rates. For estimate
(2) the results are given in total populations
(males and females separately). The results
of the other estimates are given by five-year
age groups for each sex. For all the estimates
the resultant populations are given by fiveyear time intervals up to the year 2035.
