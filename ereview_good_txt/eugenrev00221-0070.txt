Marriage in England and Wales

SOME FACTS

HE ESTIMATED PROPORTIONS married
in 1958 were as follows:

AGE-GROUP MEN WOMEN
15—19 0-041 0-061
20—24 0-309 0-561
25—29 0-666 0-822
30—34 0-832 0-880
35—44 0-870 0.861
45—54 0-883 0-790
55—64 0-862 0-653
65 and over 0-688 0:341

Marriage rates have risen in recent times,
especially for women, and to-day one-half of
men are married by about age twenty-five and
one-half of women are married by about age
twenty-two. If the marriage rates of the year 1958
were to continue indefinitely, the proportions
married by age forty-five would rise to about 94
per cent for men and 96 per cent for women as a
maximum. In fact, however, such a result as this
cannot happen; as the total numbers of men and
women available for marriage are not equal,
whereas the total numbers married must be
equal, the proportions married cannot be so
nearly the same for both sexes. It is expected that
if present trends continue the maximum proportion of women married may indeed rise to something like 95 per cent; but the corresponding
proportion for men may not exceed 90 per cent,
now that the “supply”’ of men is becoming more
plentiful than that of women.

Marriage rates vary from region to region

within the country, also vary by occupation and
social class. The differences relate mainly to the
age at marriage rather than the proportion
ultimately marrying. An analysis made in 1931
showed that among men aged twenty-one to
twenty-four only 6 per cent were married in
Social Class I but 20 per cent in Social Class V
(note the contrast between the figure of 16 per
cent for all men at that time and the corresponding figure of 25 per cent to-day). But at ages
thirty-five to forty-four in 1931 the corresponding
proportions were 84 per cent in Class I and 82 per
cent in Class V (for all classes, 85 per cent as
compared with 87 per cent in 1958).

Contrasts between Great Britain and other
countries in marriage statistics are also largely in
age at marriage. At one extreme, the Irish marry
so late that even at age forty-five only about twothirds are wedded. At the other, in Egypt threequarters of women are married by age twentytwo. The other principal source of international
differences is forms and customs of marriage. In
the West Indies, for instance, besides marriage
legalised by a church ceremony there are also
“consensual” marriages, that is to say unions
recognized and accepted as permanent by the
people and yet not legally binding. About 10 per
cent of the adult Barbadians are ‘“‘married”’ in
this way, and the corresponding proportion in
some other parts of the West Indies is as much
as 25 per cent.
