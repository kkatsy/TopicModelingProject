Difterential Marriage

SOME

AT THE EUGENICS SOCIETY’S Symposium in
1965, Genetic and Environmental Factors in
Human Ability, reference was made to differential
fertility of various kinds, and it was inquired to
what extent its effects might be mitigated or
offset by differential marriage.

So far as social class disparities are concerned,
some information is available from most of the
recent Censuses of England and Wales. The
occupational analyses prepared by the Registrar

score and a high proportion marrying, the same
result is not found in analyses by social class,
and one reason for this may lie in the exclusion
of the unoccupied.

Generally similar features were disclosed by
the 1911 Census figures. |

Confirmation from some more modern statistics can be obtained from the 1951 Census
data as follows: first, data are available for
specific occupation groups, and from these one

General relate to (i) all men, and (ii) married
men, and proportions married can be derived
from these data. The results for 1931 are as
shown in Table 1.

By and large, most occupied men marry and
there is little difference in the ultimate proportions between the social classes, although the
figures for Classes I and V tend to be below
those for the central groups. The highernumbered classes tend to marry earlier than the
lower-numbered ones, and this would make the
length of the generation shorter. The proportion
of unoccupied and retired men married is ultimately only about half as large as for occupied
men, one reason being that in many cases the
activity or disability that prevents the pursuit
of an occupation also renders marriage less
likely from a physical and an economic viewpoint. The unoccupied are not, however, treated
as a “social class”. Whereas, therefore, differentials measured by intelligence test scores show
a marked positive correlation between a good

may contrast, say, professional and technical
workers on the one hand with unskilled labourers
on the other. Here are some typical results:

Professional and Technical 0-17 0-88
Unskilled 0-26 0:83
Retired and not gainfully occupied 0-05 0°55

An alternative approach is as follows: the
numbers of men classified by age-group and
social class are available; so are the numbers of
all married women who were enumerated with
their husbands. The ratios of these married
women to the men can be calculated either (a) in
the same age-groups, or (b) taking an age-group
for women five years’ younger than for men.
(The average disparity in age between husbands

and wives lies between 0 and 5 years.) The

Finally, Table 5 shows (i) the fertility

There is little evidence here of any marked

change in the differentials, although there is a

Assuming the wife five years younger than her
