Army Examinations and Heredity (continued).
By B.S. BRAMWELL,

It occurred to me that it would be of some interest to examine the
war records of the various officers whose scholastic records were the
subject of my previous article. The school has published a record of
its former pupils in the war, so a large body of material is available for
investigation. The only question is how to treat it. It is impossible
to make rank our standard of comparison; we have however a list of the
various decorations, brevet-ranks and mentions in despatches. Can
these be taken for the purpose? Would they be fair as between sapper,
gunner and infantryman? So far as the individual is concerned one
knows that honours are fickle things and may depend very largely on the
idiosyncrasies of Divisional Generals. Generals often have strong
views about branches of the service other than their own. ‘‘I’m not
going to have any more d ed artillery up here,’’ this from a Sapper
General. ‘‘He’ll go mad I tell you, all sappers are mad,’’ this from a
gunner staff officer. ‘‘We wondered whether the Scientific branch
could help us,’’ this with icy politeness from an Infantry Divisional
Commander to a gunner colonel, a clever mathematician; the problem
being a formula for the range of view from an aeroplane at various
heights.

Some generals give few recommendations, others are lavish in their
recommendations. This will not affect the fairness of our criterion
very greatly, however, as each division is composite, so if the Commander is lavish or sparing, sapper, gunner and infantryman will fare
alike. A more difficult question arises from the fact that most
Divisional Commanders are infantrymen or cavalrymen and so might be
expected to show a preference in the direction of the infantry. As
against this might be set the fact that casualties amongst the infanry
are more severe. It is obvious that men killed in their first action have
little chance of earning rewards of the nature under consideration. So
possibly some correction would have to be made for this before a fair
comparison can be made between sapper, gunner and infantrymen. We
are not concerned with preferment to the higher positions of command
in the army. The age of the men under consideration forbids this.
The oldest of them could only be 48 when the war started. Asa matter
of fact though many attained to the position of Brigadier-general only
two obtained the rank of Major-general. The average age at the outbreak of war was about 34.

From our former totals we must deduct all those who did not take
part in the war of 1914-18. This analysis is of some interest. It shows
the number of deaths, a total of 10%, and how they were distributed ;
it also shows the numbers of those who had resigned or retired up to
1910, the date of the Register, and who did not come forward for
service in 1914. It is therefore to some extent a record of the effectiveness of the various classes of officers. There is also a small percentage

take part in the war and yet they are shewn as serving soldiers in the
register in 1910. They probably died or resigned in the intervening
period.

One is tempted to moralise on the fact that the percentage of
deaths from disease is least in the sapper class and greatest in the
militia class and to recall that athletic power as well as intellectual
ability perhaps diminishes in this class but the volume of figures is too
small to build up theories on it. One may notice the figures in passing
for what they are worth and also that the figures for resignations and
eases of which we have no particulars occur with least frequency in
the sapper and with most in the Sandhurst and militia classes.
We are now in a postion to consider the statistics of the great war.

In doing so we must first deduct all those shewn in the last table as
not having taken part in it, and look solely at the balance. Certain
officers have transferred from the original corps; I have treated these
however under the original corps and not under their second choice.
What we are considering, after all, is individuals and their intellectual
differences rather than soldiers. These cases are not very numerous,
one of the commonest is for gunners to transfer to the Indian Army ; such
cases are here treated as gunners and not as Indian officers. As the
opportunities of the Indian officers considered in bulk were less than
those of other officers owing to the necessary retention of a large number
of them in India, the gunner category would suffer to some extent by
this treatment of our figures but as I have already mentioned our
quest is the intellectual history and development of certain young men
passing certain examinations when about the age of twenty. We had
them classified then by army examiners; we had them classified at an
earlier age by their schoolmasters; we are now going to have them
classified by Generals and see if they are placed in anything like the
ARMY EXAMINATIONS AND HEREDITY. 527

same order of merit. As in our previous investigation but for entirely
different reasons (probably that just stated) the Indian officer class
stands in an anomalous position and our main attention should be
directed to the other four classes, sappers, gunners, Sandhurst officers
and Militia officers.

I now give the statistics relating to the Great War; in considering
the figures of decorations, brevet promotions and mention in despatches
only those won in this war are included and no notice is taken of those
awarded in previous camapigns.

We have now two standards of comparison namely, which class of
officer got most honours and in which class were fewest officers honoured. I do not suppose that anyone will suggest that there was a
conspiracy amongst those with the power to grant awards and mentions
to favour one class of officer at the expense of another class although
individual generals may have had prejudices; on the other hand army
custom may be largely responsible for the very curious outcome of our
investigation. For if it be granted that the position of the Indian
officers was rather anonalous for purposes of comparison with other
officers in the war and may therefore be neglected our remaining four
classes fall into proper sequence for both the tests suggested, except in
one single instance. I have mentioned that probably some correction
should be made to correct for the unequal incidence of casualties. The
totals I have given in the last table, of officers who did not receive a
decoration, brevet promotion or mention did not include officers who
became casualties. But such cases are of considerable number (6, 14,
22, 64, and 40 in the five classes). It is obvious that some of these
officers can have had no opportunity of earning distinction, others on
the other hand may not have become casualties until the final stages
of the war. What allowance should be made to meet these circumstances? It is rather difficult to determine exactly but the
extreme views are either to make no allowance at all or to deduct all
such cases from our tota] of officers serving in the war before considering
$28 EUGENICS REVIEW.

percentages or rewards of officers who did not appear in the lists of
decorations, etc. The correct allowance must lie between these extremes. If we take a mean result between our two extremes and
deduct half the total of such cases from the total of officers who served
we Shall not be very far wrong.

ta Leaving out of account the Indian officer class and noting the one
instance where the figures deviate slightly from what might possibly
have been expected, namely that gunner officers who did not become
casualties and who did not receive recognition in despatches, etc., were
slightly more numerous than similar Sandhurst officers, we have the
result that the merits of officers are graded by Generals as they were
graded by army examiners on the average 14 to 20 years previously,
and as by schoolmasters some 4 or 5 years earlier still. Further that
this grading is in accord with the intellectual grading of their brothers
as determined by the Army examiners and by other methods and also
with that of their fathers as estimated by the methods described in
my previous article. The most obvious criticism which’occurs to me
of this rather remarkable agreement.of fact with eugenic theory, is
that the Army is a conservative institution largely governed by tradition and precedent and that possibly it may be customary to make
awards in accordance with a traditionary scale of ability. While
there may be something in such an explanation, it hardly seems
sufficient to cover the whole ground. If it is thought that little weight
should be given to this or similar explanations and that the numbers
of rewards, etc., are a fair indication of the military merits of the four
classes, they are then also a testimonial to the efficacy of the Army
examination system.

We can also compare the various grades in which boys were
placed on entering school in the light of this new standard of rewards
and mentions in the war. The reader may remember that in my previous article I made a classification of 654 boys into seven grades based
on the class they joined on entering school and this class depends on the
school entrance examination. I have traced the war record of 576 of
these boys. It will be advisable to introduce a correction again for
the case of those officers whose names did not appear in despatches
ARMY EXAMINATIONS AND HEREDITY. 529:

and who. became casualties. I propose to make as before an allowance
by deducting 50 per cent. of such cases from my gross totals and then
to compare my remainder with the number of rewards, brevet promotions and mentions won by each grade. In the subjoined table therefore the first column will show the whole 576 officers distributed in the
seven grades. The second column has a full deduction of all officers
who became casualties and who were unrewarded or unmentioned in
despatches. The third column has the 50 per cent. deduction. The
fourth column shows the decorations, etc., won by each grade and the
fifth column reduces column four to a percentage of column three.

Leaving out of account grade 7 where the numbers are too small
for a fair comparison, it will be noted that the first five grades fall into
a regular order but that grade six breaks the series. I therefore
analysed the components of this grade more closely, More than 75%
of its components are Sandhurst and Militia officers. The Sandhurst officers are quite normal according to this test and fall into their theoretical
place with a percentage below that in grade five which in turn is below
that in grade four. The abnormality depends entirely therefore on
the Militia officers who have a much higher percentage of rewards, etc.,
than the Militia officers in the two immediate higher grades. Four
officers out of thirty-five Militia officers in this grade are responsible
for no less than 33 out of 61 decorations, etc. On examining more
fully the careers of these officers I found that two entered the school when
when over fifteen and a half years of age and although 2 classes below
the norma! of their age at entry had reached a more normal position on
leaving. It is not unlikely that they were handicapped at the start by
their early education not having followed the ordinary channels. If
we were at liberty to discount these two cases grade six would very
nearly fall into line. The other two cases cannot be explained away
on any such hypothesis. In each case the boy had failed to improve
his position in the scholastic sense after a bad start. They each had
brothers with a similar history. In each case the war record is magnificent, one of high courage and splendid tenacity. And yet at school
neither had been of any athletic renown. There are other things
besides intellectual and muscular power of importance in warfare.
Subject to these exceptions the correspondence of the intellectual
grade in early youth with performance as measured by Military
authorities in manhood is striking.

I append tables of the ranks and decorations shewn in the war
record.
