STAGES IN POPULATION GROWTH’
By C. P. BLACKER

HE science of demography has been
| described as the statistical study of
populations in terms of births, deaths,
marriages and migration. Demography is a
mainly quantitative study: considerations
of quality which call for value-judgments
belong rather to the province of eugenics.
But demography genetics and eugenics are
linked, and some writers think that demography should comprise qualitative as well as
quantitative studies.

In a broad view of the world, a view extending beyond Western Europe and the
“advanced ”’ countries which now have low
fertilities, qualitative or eugenic considerations yield precedence to quantitative. Indeed, preoccupations about quality do not
naturally arise until the purely numerical
question takes on a certain aspect.

A Demographic Cycle: Five Phases

A demographic cycle has been described
through which passes a country which is
being industrialized and urbanized. An
attempt will be made to describe this cycle
and to sketch the differential growth of the
peoples of the world. We are here confronted
with a menacing long-term threat to future
peace. Indeed, the world can scarcely be
safeguarded from war until a solution is
reached of the demographic dilemma which
chiefly confronts the continent of Asia.

The problem which now _ preoccupies
British demographers, the problem which a
Royal Commission has been appointed to
consider, is one of diminishing fertility. We
are apt to lose sight of the fact that the
predicament which confronts the world as
a whole is not one of falling, but of rising
numbers. The population of the world,

It is contended elsewhere in the book that eugenic or
qualitative problems do not commonly arise until a
certain stage (the late expanding stage) of population
growth is reached. The quantitative question therefore

forms the background of the qualitative. The latter
arises naturally in its own time.

though imperfectly known to-day and still
less known in the past, has, in the last five
generations, enormously increased. Indeed,
it has almost certainly doubled in 150 years.

To the best of our knowledge, the population of the world grew from some 919
millions in 1800 to some 2,080 millions in
1939, a percentage increase of 127. Throughout this period the continent of Asia contained more people than the whole of the
rest of the world put together. The peoples
of North and Central America grew faster
than those of any other major region: they
show an eleven-fold growth—largely the
result of what Woodrow Wilson called ‘‘ The
Swarming of the English.”

This prodigious increase in the number of
human beings is the direct result of influencés
which have emanated from the ‘‘ Western,”
hemisphere. Let us consider more closely
what has happened. Five stages, or phases,
are discernible in the demographic cycle
which may be denoted by the following
terms: high stationary, early expanding, late
expanding, low stationary, and diminishing.

STAGES IN POPULATION GROWTH | 89

High Stationary Phase

1. The high stationary phase is marked by
high birth-rates and high death-rates. It
characterizes the conditions of a mainly
agricultural population living near the Malthusian subsistence levels. Such communities sustain themselves under the shadow of
natural vicissitudes over which they have
acquired but scanty control. Birth-rates are
consistently high, ranging somewhere between forty and fifty per thousand ; deathrates approximately balance them, but
fluctuate between wide extremes. In a
sequence of good years, when harvests are
rich and livestock flourishes, food will be
abundant and numbers will mount; but a
year of drought, an epidemic disease which
kills the cattle, the flooding of a river-basin
so that a wide area is inundated, a serious
outbreak of a pestilence (typhus, plague,
cholera and other diseases are endemic in
many parts of-the world) may cause death
on a large scale. The populations of small
areas can then be decimated. The calamity
may even afflict large areas. Pestilences,
among which bubonic plague was prominent,
afflicted the Roman empire. The Black
Death which spread over most of Europe in
the fourteenth century killed off, perhaps, a
quarter of its people. A minimum of some
fifteen million died in India through the
influenza epidemic in 1918 and 1gI9.

The most important country still remaining in the high stationary phase of the demographic cycle is China. No one knows even
approximately what is the population of
China, where no comprehensive census has
ever been held. Estimates of the population
vary within astonishingly wide limits: two
estimates made in 1937 and 1940 respectively
differ by as much as a hundred millions.
China has no strong central Government and
communications throughout her enormous
area are poor. Effective measures of famine
relief are therefore impossible: food cannot
be moved from one part toanother. Warren S.
Thompson, who knows China at first-hand,
writes :

The death-rate in China is highly variable

from year to year and from place to place....
This violent fluctuation, much more violent than

the fluctuation in birth-rates, is probably characteristic of all populations which, like that of
China, have practically no health service and
live close to the subsistence level, even in
“ good "’ years.

This authority puts the population of the
Chinese empire at somewhere between 375
and 425 millions. He doubts whether there
has been any appreciable decline in the deathrate in recent decades which would have
resulted in a significant growth of population. The age-old Malthusian dilemma still
confronts China. Other countries perhaps to
be counted in the high stationary phase
(accurate figures are not available) are
Afghanistan, Persia, Arabia and Ethiopia.
So also are many of the native peoples of
Africa, Indonesia and South America.

Early Expanding Phase

2. The early expanding whtase of the
demographic cycle is characterized by high
birth-rates of the “‘ high stationary ’”’ level
and by lower, often falling, death-rates. The
difference between these two rates, migration
being ignored, is the measure of the natural
increase. All of the non-white countries of
Eastern Asia except China (which is in the
high stationary phase) and Japan (which is
in the late expanding phase) are in this stage. So are the countries of Central America and
of the North and West coasts of South
America, most of the continent of Africa and
the Moslem countries. Some examples are
given in Table II (see p. 90).

Growth characteristic of the early expanding phase is a first reaction to Western influences. Agricultural methods are improved
by the use of fertilizers and crop rotation, so
that food supplies become more abundant ;
mineral and fuel resources begin to be
developed and machine industries founded ;
elementary sanitation and medical services
are introduced ; irrigation and river control
are initiated ; transport by road or rail is
improved, thus facilitating the movement of
food supplies to famine areas, suppressing
banditry, and increasing general security ;
lastly, a strong central Government is established. These conditions have been introduced by the colonizing powers into their

The figures, taken from the Statistical Year Book of the League of Nations, Geneva, 1945, are provisional or
approximate for all the countries except Palestine. Registration of births and deaths presents difficulties, different
for each category. The deaths of children are especially liable to escape notice, and the rates probably underestimate the realities, especially in the earlier periods shown in the table.

raise the figure of 203 to 256 millions. The
census population in 1941 numbered just
under 389 millions. The seven intervening
decades have produced remarkable variations in decennial increase, ranging from
under three millions in three decades
(1872-81; 1891-1901; I9gII-21) to over 50
millions in the most recent decade (193141). Such fluctuations, caused mainly by
famines and epidemics, mark India’s transition from the high stationary phase to the
early expanding phase of the demographic
cycle.

An authoritative Health Survey and Development Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Joseph Bhore and consisting of
nineteen Indian and seven British persons,
all equipped with high medical, scientific
or administrative qualifications, produced,
early in 1946, the four volumes of their
report.* The views of this committee can be
taken as the most recent and the most
authoritative statement of the present condition of India’s health and of that country’s

future needs. I will quote three paragraphs

which could scarcely be more succinct :

. Mortality

304. During the last two decades there has
been a steady fall in the mortality rate of the
country. A further fall is bound to occur if the
large-scale programmes for improving the health
of the community advocated by the different
post-war planning committees are effectively
put into operation. There is every reason to
believe that there will be a saving of at least three
million lives every year in British India, which
will bring its rate of mortality down to the level
of what has already been accomplished in a
number of other countries. In the decennium
between 1931 and 1941, the average yearly
addition to the population of India as a whole
was five millions. An annual saving of three
millions in British India as the result of improved health conditions will raise India’s rate
of growth to 8 millions a year, without taking

into consideration any fall in mortality that may
be brought about in the Indian States through
similar health measures. Under such conditions,
the very large increase of 83 millions, which took
place in the twenty-year period between 1921 and
I941, ts likely to be reached within half that time.
(My italics.) A purposeful control of mortality,
without a corresponding fall in the fertility rate
of the community, can thus have far-reaching
consequences.
Fertility

305. All available information seems to suggest that the fall in the fertility rate in India
during the past sixty years has been negligible
compared with the fall in mortality. In this
connection certain estimates of the rate of fertility and mortality for the country are quoted
from an interesting study of India’s population
problem by Kingsley Davis, under the title of
“‘ Demographic Fact and Policy in India,” pub
lished in the Milbank Memorial Quarterly
(July 1944).

306. It seems fairly clear that, at least in the
immediate future, there is little reason to believe
that there would be a marked fall in the fertility rate of the country.

According to the above table, India’s
efforts to emerge between the years 1881 and
1921 from the high stationary to the early
expanding phase of the demographic cycle
were spasmodic and uncertain. In the decade
1gi1-21, birth and death rates, both very
high, were closely similar. But in the decade
1921-31 the death-rates plunged sharply
down, thus unmistakeably signalizing India’s
entry into the early expanding phase of the
cycle. The committee say that they think
that India’s population may grow by over
80 millions in every ten years. Her position
is thus conspicuously different from that of
China where, as previously remarked, the
high stationary phase of the cycle still seem
to prevail. 4

Something has been said about the difficulties of conducting a census in India.
Similar difficulties attend vital registration,
g2 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

as is shown by the following extract from
the above-mentioned committee’s report
(Volume 1) :

In towns and cities, the municipal authority
is responsible for the registration of vital
statistics, and this function is usually a part of
the duties of the Health Department. In the
rural areas, the village watchman or the chowkidar is usually the reporting agent. ... One of
the causes of ...incompleteness of registration is that, over large areas of the country,
registration of births and deaths is not compulsory. Further, as has been pointed out in the
‘Memorandum on Indian vital statistics, ‘‘ even
in those limited areas where vital registration is
compulsory, the provisions of the Acts are rarely
enforced so that, generally speaking, vital statistics are deplorably defective.’’ Another cause is
that the village chowkidar, who is responsible for
reporting these events in respect of the rural
population, and the police, who are responsible
for registration, are so overburdened with other
work that their tendency is to regard their duties
in connection with vital statistics as of relatively
smaller importance.

This description gives an idea of the
difficulties of obtaining accurate demographic
records in undeveloped countries.*

Let us return to the early expanding
countries of Asia taken as a whole. The
numerical expansion of the “colonial”
countries and islands of that continent
(India, Indonesia, Malaya, Thailand, the
Philippines and Indo-China) will probably
change the future contribution to world
population growth made respectively by the
continent of Asia and by the rest of the
world.

Late Expanding Phase

3. The late expanding phase of the demographic cycle is marked by declining birthrates and death-rates, wherein the deathrates are consistently lower than the birthrates, thus yielding annual increases in
population.

Much the largest and most important of
the countries included in this group is the
U.S.S.R., about which very detailed studies
have recently been published by American
writers. For the figures here presented, I am

statistics is given by R. R. Kuczynski in The Measurement of Population Growth, 1935. Sidgwick & Jackson.

indebted to Frank Lorimer’s most valuable
and compendious study.*

These figures are not official, for such have
been sparsely published despite the activity
of the Soviet Government in the demographic
field. One of the earliest tasks set itself by
the Russian revolutionary Government was
to improve the vital statistics of the immense
area it covered.

Responsibility, writes Lorimer, for the registration of vital statistics had been transferred at
the time of the revolution from ecclesiastical to
civil authorities. This transfer encountered some
resistance among conservative groups. Moreover the organization of a new registration system
within the framework of a revolutionary society,
in a nation recovering from war, civil disturbance and famine, and with half of the population
illiterate, was a stupendous undertaking. However, great energy was devoted to this task,
which was recognised as an essential requirement of the planned organization of Soviet
society. The new registration system was
operating over a wide area by 1924.

By 1926, vital statistics were being collected from almost the whole of European
Russia, from Siberia, Buryat-Mongolia (comprising Lake Baikal) and Armenia. In 1926,
moreover, there took place on December
17th the first All-Union census of population
whereof Lorimer says. that it revealed a
“high degree of statistical efficiency, although
the wide prevalence of illiteracy necessarily
introduced serious irregularities in the basic
data on some topics, such as the distribution
of population by single year of age.’’ The
census disclosed a population of 147,027,915.

The next census of the U.S.S.R. was held
twelve years later, on January 17th, 19309.
In the intervening period the size of the
population was hypothetically computed
from the annual figures for birth and death
registration with appropriate allowances for
migration. It is obvious that the accuracy of
this computation of the total population in
each of the intervening years between the two
censuses must depend on the accuracy with
which births and deaths are registered. If the
second census discloses a population falling
short of the expected figure, then we are
justified in supposing that during those years

* The Population of the Soviet Union, 1946. League of
Nations, Geneva.
STAGES IN POPULATION GROWTH 98

vital registration must somehow have been
imperfect. This is what happened. The
second All-Union census held in January
1939 was expected by two Soviet actuaries
(Novoselskiy and Payevshiy) to show a
figure of over I91 millions. It actually disclosed a population of 170,467,186. There
was a deficit of over 20 millions between the
expected and actual population.

Lorimer gives good reasons for thinking
that this discrepancy arose from underregistration of deaths, especially of infantile
deaths, in the intervening period. And he
has adjusted the rates accordingly, as shown

in Table III:

* European part of U.S.S.R. only.

The figures suggest that, at the beginning of
the period under review, Russia was emerging
from the early expanding and entering the
late expanding phase of the demographic
cycle. Up till 1929, very high birth-rates
(over 40 per 1,000 of population) prevailed.
They are of the order characteristic of the
countries shown in Table II as belonging to
the early expanding phase of the cycle. But
after 1929 there set in a steady fall in birthrates which reached their lowest point with
a birth-rate of 30°1 in 1934 and 1935. There
then occurred a striking and dramatic rise.
This movement was probably caused by a
change in official policy towards the prevalent
and spreading practice of abortion, and to
the Soviet Government’s initiative in launching an active population policy.

The general picture disclosed by Table III
is one of steadily falling death-rates and of
birth-rates falling also, but lagging far
behind the death-rates.

Japan is another important country, to-day
further advanced in the late expanding phase
of the demographic cycle than Russia. Japan
is the only country of Eastern Asia—perhaps
the only country of the Asiatic continent,
excluding the U.S.S.R. and the Jewish element of the population of Palestine—to have
reached the late expanding phase. Hence her
present demographic position is worth further
consideration. For the facts here set forth,
I am again indebted among other works to
Warren S. Thompson’s study.

The population of Japan in 1650 is estimated at 23 millions, and Carr-Saunders*
states that this figure is more solid than that
for any country in Europe at that date. In
1721 an edict enjoined on certain territorial
lords the duty of reporting on the populations
of their areas during the preceding eighty
years ; and after 1726 these dignitaries were
required to make similar reports every six
years. Eighteen.such estimates were submitted before 1846. There is then a gap in
our knowledge of Japanese population movements between 1846 and 1874. But in that
year the police were required to keep family
registers, and in 1886, civil registration was
introduced. The first census was carried out
on October Ist, 1920. From that year
information is abundant. “ ,

From the above-mentioned data, it looks
as if the population of Japan increased from
about 23 millions in 1650 to about 28-1
millions in 1721; and it remained, with
fluctuations, fairly constant at about that.
level for some 125 years, being estimated at
28:9 millions in 1846. For 1872, a figure of
33 millions is given. A steady increase then
set in which is sometimes attributed to the
abandonment, when the Tokugawa shogunate came to an end, of the practices of
abortion and infanticide, which had been
prevalent in Japan during the eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries.

The end of the shogunate was the signal of
a new era in Japan.

It was only a little over seventy-five years ago,
writes Warren Thompson, with the restoration
of the Emperor to the headship of the State, that

94 | THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Japan broke decisively with the traditional

economy of the past and began to adopt the
industrial economy of the West. Prior to that
time, Japanese industry was almost entirely a
-simple hand industry concerned with the needs
of a local population. . . . Their needs were
largely determined by custom and were stabilised
at a level just sufficient to maintain life in the
mass of the population. The Japanese were then
living much as the mass of the Chinese do to-day,
with an extremely narrow margin between production and starvation—a margin which was not
always maintained.

The leaders of the country then embarked
on the programme of industrialization which
culminated in the attack on Pearl Harbour.
The steps in this change are very clearly
described by Thompson, who stresses the
accompanying development of town life:

' Whereas 19°9 per cent of the Japanese people

lived in communities of 30,000 or more in 1920,

28:5 per cent lived in such communities in 1930,

and 38°4 per cent in 1940. The same trend is

shown by the declining proportion of the occupied population engaged in agriculture. This
group declined from 52°4 per cent in 1920 to

43°7 per cent in 1936. ... Probably not over 40

per cent of the occupied population of Japan

is now engaged in agriculture.

This movement from the countryside
towards the towns has an important effect
on the birth-rate. It was remarked above
that abortion and infanticide were prevalent
in Japan in the century before 1868. Abortions do not count as births; but infants
killed after birth should so count, though
there are obvious reasons why their births
should escape registration. Though the

practice of infanticide may well have masked.

the realities, birth-rates in Japan before that
country’s industrialization were probably
as high as those of other countries in the
high stationary or early expanding phase.
Thus in the rural areas, Thompson points out,
birth-rates are still high. ‘‘ In 1933 the five
northern prefectures on the main island had
an average birth-rate of 39-7 per 1,000 and
an average death-rate of 19-6, leaving a
natural increase of 20-1, which is far above
that for Japan as a whole.” Indeed, it is
part of Thompson’s thesis that declines of
death and birth rates which characterize the
whole demographic cycle are almost automatic accompaniments of the processes of
industrialization and urbanization.

Table IV, showing birth and death rates
for Japan, can be compared with Table III
which gives similar rates for the U.S.S.R.

* Provisional or approximate figures.

The above figures, taken in conjunction
with the fact above-mentioned that in 1933
the birth-rates in a rural part of Japan were
as high as 39:7, suggest that by 1911 Japan
was already far advanced in the late expanding phase of the demographic cycle. She had
left well behind her the high birth-rates of
40 and over per 1,000 which typify the
“earlier ’’ phase.

The nine countries shown in Table V
exemplify movements occurring in the late
expanding phase (see p. 95).

The first four countries are from Eastern
or South-Eastern Europe; Italy and Spain
are South European countries ; the Argentine
and Chile are South American countries and
it will be seen that the Argentine has, in the
last decade, reduced her death-rate to a low
level. All these countries show the following
features :

In every year, birth-rates are higher,
sometimes much higher, than death-rates ;
birth-rates, which rarely exceed 40 per 1,000
(though allowance for under-registration
should be made in the countries asterisked),
show a sometimes irregular decline throughout the period. Death-rates show a steadier
decline with fewer and less striking intermissions,

The Jewish population of Palestine shows

end of the late expanding period, a moment
arrives when what is at the time happening
is an unsafe guide to what is likely to go on
happening. An excess of births over deaths
in a given year implies that in that year
(emigration excluded) the population has increased ; but such an excess does not necessarily imply that the increase is likely to
continue in the future. The crude birth and

year, very low (under 8 per 1,000), partly
because of the large number of young
immigrants. The two elements are in
different phases of the demographic cycle.
The present and future implications of this
difference are obvious.

Low Stationary Phase
4. The fourth or low stationary phase of
the demographic cycle is marked by low

birth and death rates. But there arises here a
difficulty which can be overlooked if birth
and death rates alone are considered. The
difficulty relates to what is likely to happen
in the future. When birth-rates are consistently and conspicuously higher than
death-rates, we can assert not only that the
population 7s increasing but that it will
probably go on increasing. But towards the

death rates give, like a snapshot, a momentary picture of events in a given year; but
they have little predictive value.

The most useful index is here the net reproduction rate: this has been so well and so
often explained that it need not be described
here beyond saying that it epitomises and
condenses in a simple figure the reproductive
activities of all childbearing women in a
ot

96 : oO THE EUGENICS REVIEW

country. When the index stands at unity the
reproductive element in the female population will be exactly replaced (if current trends
continue and we ignore migration) in the
next generation. When the index falls below
unity, the same element is failing to reproduce itself. It can happen, indeed it nearly
always happens when a country is passing
from the late expanding into the low stationary phase of the cycle, that when low
birth-rates exceed still lower death-rates,
the net reproduction rate is standing at or
below unity. When, therefore, we consider
which countries are to be placed in the low
stationary category, we dowell to be guided by
the net reproduction rate and to ignore small
disparities between low birth and death rates.

Here a parenthetic question arises. Why
not, then, the reader may ask, use the net
reproduction rate in describing the three preceding phases? There are two answers:
In the first place, the net rate does not enable
us at a glance to assign a country to its
appropriate place in the cycle. A country in
the high stationary phase would have a net
reproduction rate of about unity; but its
gross reproduction rate, which does not take
account of mortality, would be much higher.
Indeed, the disparity between the gross and
net reproduction rates is a measure of the
mortality by which the female moiety of the
population is reduced throughout its reproductive life. In the second place, the gross
and net reproduction rates call for more
detailed information about a population than
do crude birth and death rates. The latter
require a knowledge of the country’s total
population in a given year (for the rates are
calculated per thousand of the total population) and of the numbers of births and deaths
occurring in that year. But the gross reproduction rate requires further a classification
of the female population by age-groups, and
a record of the age of the mother at each
birth ; the net reproduction rate, which takes
into account the deaths likely to occur between one generation and the next, still
further requires a knowledge of deaths by
sex and year of age at death. This information is not available of all countries ; indeed,
the less advanced a country in the demog
raphic cycle, the fewer and the less reliable
its essential records. But if as much progress
is made in demographic methods in the next
hundred years as was made in the last
hundred, it will shortly be possible to assess
the vital trends of the countries of the world
far more precisely than is possible to-day.

Fertility has fluctuated throughout the
world in surprising ways in the last ten years..
Rises have occurred in many countries during
the second world war which have not borne
out expectations based on events during the
first. The rates of several countries stood
below unity before the war but have risen
above unity since its outbreak. It is too soon
to say how permanent are these reversals of
past trends. Included among the following
seventeen countries are some whose net rates
have sunk below and risen above unity in the
last ten years. These rates (some not strictly
accurate) are fluctuating about unity and
justify us in placing the countries concerned
in the low stationary group:

Czechoslovakia), the U.S.A., Australia and
New Zealand. None is in Asia, Africa
or South America. France is the only
country : whose net reproduction rate has,
since the turn of the century, consistently
fluctuated below unity (Table IX).

Declining Phase
5. The fifth or declining phase of the

demographic cycle is one which it is the
object of all the countries mentioned in the
preceding paragraph to avoid. The phase is
easy to recognise and define, for it is marked
by an actual excess of deaths over births and,
unless compensated by immigration, by a fall
in numbers.

The depopulation of certain islands, such
as Tasmania, where none of the original
native inhabitants survive, or of Tropical
Oceania where they have been much reduced ;
or the disappearance of native races from
areas of a continent, as the North American
Indians have disappeared from many of their
original hunting grounds, are to be counted
rather as a reaction to the spread over the
globe of the white man than as an autonomous phase in a demographic cycle. In
recent times, France is the only country
which has experienced an actual excess of
deaths over births for more than a momentary period ; and there are signs that, perhaps
as a result of very energetic measures taken
since the end of the second world war, this
trend is now being reversed.

It will be seen from Table VIII that during
the decade 1911-20 deaths exceeded births by
wide margins; yet in the following fifteen
years (1921-35, Table VII) births again predominated. But from 1936 onwards, unfavourable trends reasserted themselves.
Since the end of the second world war,
however, the new French Government has
pursued a very vigorous population policy
with what are claimed as satisfactory results.

Since the turn of the century, the effects of
low birth-rates were heavily offset by the
encouragement of immigration. Precise
figures cannot be given because of France’s
long land-frontiers; but there was on
balance an inward movement from 1872,
which reached its maximum in the decade
1921-31 when no less than 1,953,000 immigrants were computed to have entered the
98

country.* Many of these were young adults
employed in the reconstruction of areas
devastated in the first world war; some of
’ them—about 332,000 between 1931 and 1936
—became naturalized Frenchmen.

The upshot of these considerations is that,
during the eight years 1936-43 and discounting immigration, the population of France
was at least transitorily declining. Will this
trend be permanently reversed? France's
friends will hope so.

What is the world picture which emerges
irom our review of the five phases above
described of the demographic cycle?

phases; and in Table XI are shown the
populations of the continents of the world
which fall respectively into the combined

Sir Halford Mackinder, in an important

“World Island ’”’ the land mass comprised
by the continents of Asia, Africa and Europe.
When Europe and Africa were once joined by
a land bridge across what are now the Straits
of Gibraltar, the Mediterranean was, as its
name implies, a land-locked inland sea. Asia,
Africa and Europe then formed a vast island
bounded by the Arctic, Pacific, Indian, Antarctic and. Atlantic oceans. If a globe or a

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

our continent is seen as a relatively small
peninsula of land with a swollen extremity,
Spain, with islands and smaller peninsulas
(Denmark, Great Britain, Corsica and Sardinia, Italy and Greece) decorating its
flanks. This small component of the ‘‘ world
island,’’ which was not the seat of the
earliest civilizations, outstripped in the last
thousand years the rest of the world in
technical progress. Among other arts, there
flourished those of shipbuilding and navigation, and before the era of coal Europeans
were exploring the coastlines of the rest
of the world. With the industrial revolution began a great swarming of peoples
which followed in the wake of the pioneers,
colonizing or subjugating vast areas of the
globe, exploiting its native populations, and
themselves greatly multiplying.

But Europe, caught in the momentum of
its industrial development, began to lose its
reproductive energies. The fountain-head
now begins to run dry when the basins of
other parts of the world, especially of Southern and Eastern Asia, reacting to Europe’s
influence, begin to overflow.

That is the position to-day. The northpester and central regions of Europe regard
Ithemselves as threatened with decrease ;
‘those of south-eastern and southern Europe,
though not augmenting with fullest momentum, have still large possibilities of growth ;
while those of the Asiatic continent are multiplying as fast as developing resources and
food supplies permit them] India is authoritatively regarded as having the power of adding 80 millions each decade to its numbers;
and the mainly Chinese peoples of Formosa
are doubling in twenty-nine years. Birthrates in China are such that its peoples might
well multiply like their cousins in Formosa.
In other regions of Asia there are rapid
growths of population. Manchukuo, Korea,
Indonesia, the Philippines, Burma, Malaya,
Thailand, French Indo-China all have increasing populations now well launched in
the early expanding phase of the cycle.

From Tables X and XI it will be seen that
of an estimated total world population of
2,179 millions, 1,347 millions are placed in |
the high stationary or early expanding stage ;

and that of this last total 1,092 millions (the
continent’s population minus that of Japan
and the U.S.S.R. and almost exactly half the
population of the world) are in Asia.

We may now glance at the past and the
probable future contribution of Asia to
world population. Figure 1, based upon
Table I, shows graphically how, from 1800
to 1939, Asia’s contribution to the total of
world population steadily diminished. The
rest of the world was steadily catching up
on Asia during the period that the white
peoples were “‘swarming.’’ Throughout these
139 years, the population of North and
Central America increased from an estimated
figure of 15 millions to one of 184 millions—
more than an eleven-fold increase. But
projections of to-day’s trends suggest that,
from now onwards, Asia’s population will
begin to outstrip again that of the rest of
the world.

The demographic disequilibrium of the
world to-day is surely its biggest long-term
problem. For the standards of living prevailing among the high stationary and the
early expanding peoples of Asia are far below
those of the remaining peoples. Yet we are
to-day assuming a collective responsibility to
\raise these standards. The days have, we

hope, gone for ever when glutted food-producing countries destroyed their redundant
surpluses while hundreds of millions of the
peoples of Asia were living at subsistence
level, too poor to buy. But what of the
future? The World Food and Agriculture
Organisation (F.A.O.) has been formed and
a new morality is being preached. Sir John
Boyd Orr has said that “‘ any Government
which will not accept in principle the policy
of aiding the starving world should not be
considered a Government and should not be
allowed to continue.’’ But have we realized
the implications of this revolutionary statement? The United Kingdom is far from
being self-sufficient in foodstuffs. We depend,
and are likely to continue depending for some
time to come, on imports. Purchasing powers
—and ours are not what they were—will not,
if the new code is adopted, be the sole determinants of the movement of food stocks about |
the world. If priorities are strictly decided,
not by purchasing powers but by needs, the
marginal state of the populations of Asia is
likely to keep our wives, and perhaps our
daughters, standing in queues for many years
to come.

Moreover, new policies, if successful, will
have an obvious first result. The total popu80

Asia’s contribution to world population from 1800 to 1970.

lation of Asia will increase as those of India
and Formosa have increased. To acquire the
necessary purchasing power, these countries
will industrialize themselves as Japan has
done, and will follow her footsteps in the
demographic cycle. They will pass from the
early into the late expanding phase, and
birth-rates will begin to fall. But what will
be the size of the population of Asia by the
time she has reached the low stationary levels
of the Western world? And how long will
this transition take? No one can to-day
answer these momentous questions. But it is
an encouraging sign that demographically
enlightened people in Asiatic countries are
appreciating the need for active measures to
reduce fertility.

Thus, to quote again from the report of the
authoritative Health Survey and Development Committee of India, published in 1946 :

313. All of us are agreed that, when childbearing is likely to result in injury to mother or

infant, there is every justification for the practice
of contraception. In such cases it should be the

responsibility of Governments to provide instruction regarding contraception in maternity
and child welfare centres, dispensaries, hospitals,
and any other public institutions which administer medical aid to women. We also consider
that the supply of contraceptive requisites should
be made, free of cost, by the State to necessitous
women when the practice is advocated for
reasons of health. There is also unanimity
among us in respect of State action in two other
directions, namely, (1) control over the manu-facture and sale of contraceptives as in the case
of food and drugs, and (2) assistance from public
funds towards research for the production of a
safe and effective contraceptive. (Vol. IV.)

The Committee continues to discuss how
far facilities for contraception should be provided on economic grounds (i.e. not solely on
grounds of health); but in this matter it
was divided. Among methods of reducing
fertility, it discusses the need of improving
the standards of living and of raising the age
of marriage of girls. But as a first consequence of these enlightened recommendations, it thinks that “ the rate of growth of
STAGES IN POPULATION GROWTH

the population may show an acceleration as
compared with the past.’

The fact remains that the Committee,
in the new health services for India which
it has mapped out, wishes to see included
measures for reducing fertility. Surely
we have here grounds for encouragement. If the very high fertility rates of Asia
are reduced only as a quasi-automatic byproduct of industrial development, then
changes must be slow. Wars in this century
are waged by machines which only industrialized countries can produce. The industrialization of Asia and the swarming of her
populations may together incline men’s
thoughts to war. Can Asia’s demographic
transition be effected peacefully ? If further
major wars in the West can be averted, this
will surely be the problem which will most
preoccupy our children’s generation.

The recommendations of the Health
Survey and Development Commission of
India introduce a beam of hope into an
otherwise forbidding picture. No country in
the world has yet made it an article of
national policy deliberately to reduce fertility. Who can foretell the results? If a
Health Service were set up which made it the
duty of those responsible for Maternity and
Child Welfare to give to every woman delivered of a child information on how to space
or prevent further pregnancies, there might
result an accelerated passage through the late
expanding to the low stationary phase of the

ror

demographic cycle. The dire consequences
of a prolonged transition might be averted.

There is surely another direction in which
Asiatic countries might be helped, namely
the development of women’s movements. A
feature of communities in the low stationary
phase of the demographic cycle is the
enfranchisement of their women who play
an increasingly active part in their countries’
cultural life. If the women of India, China
and the Mohammedan countries were to rise
to their opportunities, drawing inspiration
from the achievements of their sisters in the

‘ West, the rest of the world would rejoice.

The countries of Asia are rapidly emerging
from their colonial or semi-colonial status
and are becoming autonomous powers. Their
problems will be for them and not for us to
solve. But sympathy and encouragement,
perhaps also practical guidance, should not
come amiss if tactfully offered.

For the East’s problems are now those of
the West also. In a world wherein peace is
indivisible, the calamity which, on the
threshold of a uranium age, threatens an
ever more thickly populated world with a
scarcely imaginable holocaust, will engulf
East and West together. All will be its
victims.

I am indebted to the following for helpful
criticisms of an early draft: Dr. D. V. Glass,
Mr. Geoffrey Eley, Mr. Roy Glenday, Mr.
B. S. Bramwell and Dr. Maurice Newfield.
