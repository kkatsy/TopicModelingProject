An Estimate of the Future Population
of England and Wales’

Introduction

N 1944 THE Royal Commission on
Population was set up in order to determine the probable consequences of popula
tion trends then current. In order to do this they
prepared a range of sixteen separate population
projections for Great Britain based on various
combinations of assumptions as to mortality,
fertility (and marriage), and migration. The
method used, in which each component of
population change, i.e. birth, death and migration receives separate treatment, is generally
known as the component method.

2 Since the Royal Commission reported, this
method has continued to be used in preparing
what may perhaps be described as the “‘official’’
projections of the population of England and
Wales. These are calculated in the Government
Actuary’s Department on bases arrived at in
consultation with the General Register Office. A
new projection is made each year starting from
the Registrar General’s estimates of the Total
Population of men and women (including
British Armed Forces at home and elsewhere but
excluding Allied Forces in this country) in fiveyear age groups. These numbers are projected
by means of five-year survival factors, thus giving
estimates of population at five-year intervals in
future in five-year age groups. Estimates of
future births are brought into the computation in
order to produce the total population of all ages.

3 The last projection to be published gave the
numbers at five-year intervals from mid-1958 to
mid-1998 and the underlying assumptions were
described as follows:

Students’ Society. A fuller version has been published in
the Students’ Society Journal, 16, 2.

Mortality: At ages under forty-five death rates
declining steadily over the next twenty-five years
until at the end of that period they are about onehalf of the rates now being experienced. At ages
over forty-five the assumed rates of decline become
progressively smaller as the age advances. It has
been assumed that after twenty-five years the death
rates at all ages will remain at the levels then
reached.

Natality: In view of recent marriage and
fertility experience the assumptions made in the
previous projections have been modified. The
revised estimates give annual births averaging
725,000 in the first five years, 740,000 in the next
ten years, rising gradually to 790,000 in 1997 and
thereafter. (Male/Female ratio 1-06 throughout.)

Migration: Nil.
4 No attempt is made to produce a series of
projections on different assumptions: just a single
projection each year on the basis which seems
most likely, on the information then available,
to reflect future experience. The purpose of this
paper is to discuss, with such a projection in
mind, the most recent information available
under the general headings mortality, fertility
and migration, to reach decisions on a single
most probable basis for projection, and to carry
out the projection.

Mortality—Past Trends

6 Death rates have been declining for so long
now, that this has generally become accepted as
a permanent feature. Some may doubt whether
the decline is likely to continue but, more usually
and with the possible exception of the oldest
ages, argument centres not on whether they will
decline but at what rate. In the early stages the
reduction in mortality was largely attributable to
improvements in hygiene, which although simple,
yielded great results. These improvements con

tinue but the results are on a smaller scale, and
latterly our extra years of life have been more
and more due to advances in medical knowledge
and the increased availability of medical services.
Thus the past trend has arisen from a variety
of causes and this should be remembered when
extrapolating into the future on a basis derived
from an examination of past experience. Any
future decline in death rates will depend largely
on the outcome of difficult medical research;
the simple life-saving methods cannot be expected
to yield much more.

7 The first step was to examine the trend of the
mortality rates for each particular age group
over past years, to fit a curve to each series of
figures and obtain the mortality rates in future
years by continuation of these curves. From an
examination of the data it was clear that the
improvement in mortality rates had not been
linear, which is not surprising when one considers that each successive reduction in the rate
of mortality leaves less scope for future improvement. This suggested that an exponential curve
might be found more suitable, so to test this, a
series of graphs of the logarithms of the mortality
rates were drawn. In general, it was found that
these produced fairly straight lines for a long
period of years up to 1936-41 (say 1938), but
since then the decline in mortality has been more
rapid except at the older ages where a decline in
the war years was followed by a levelling off and,
in some age groups, even by an increase.

results of this analysis in a simple form which is
easy to comprehend and which can readily be
used for extrapolation if necessary, a similar
measure has been used to that in the “‘official’’
projections, viz., the ratio of the mortality rate
in twenty-five years’ time to the present rate;
this ratio might be called the “improvement
factor”. Table 1 below shows the twenty-fiveyear improvement factors calculated from the
mortality rates in 1896-1900 (1898), 1936-40
(1938) and 1951-55 (1953) assuming the rates to
improve exponentially:

(A) In the forty years from 1898 to 1938.
(B) In the fifteen years from 1938 to 1953.

Basis (A) covers the fairly stable period up to
1938 during which an exponential curve gives a
good fit, so that this basis is close to representing the actual experience during the period as
well as the rate of change over the forty years.

Basis (B) covers the period during which the
introduction of new drugs and the comprehensive health service brought about a large fall in
mortality rates. The very low factors at most ages
on this basis illustrate this fall very clearly.

9 Although other more sophisticated methods
of projection are available, the method used in
the present paper will be the straightforward
calendar year method and it remains to decide
upon what degree of improvement seems probable in future for each age group. The major part

of the benefit of the new drugs developed during
period (B) has now been felt and it would be unrealistic to expect further falls of that order.
Indeed, there are signs that some of these drugs
are becoming less effective and continuous
development is necessary even to maintain the
AN ESTIMATE OF THE

present position. (A) represents a long period of
steady improvement and might be a better guide
to the future trend on the assumption that
within the next twenty-five years there are no
spectacular medical discoveries. Such an assumption may not be justified in view of the very
considerable volume of medical research being
devoted to the prevention and cure of disease.

Mortality—The Basis Adopted for Projection

10 After special studies of such matters as the
analysis by cause of death, the relationship of
mortality in England and Wales to that in other
countries, the comparison of men’s and women’s
death rates and the trend of infant mortality, it
has been decided to assume that mortality rates
will improve exponentially in future at, broadly,
the rates of Basis (A) in paragraph 8 above.
There being no strong evidence to justify separate
factors for the two sexes, the same factors have
been used for both males and females.

11 Inthe short term the actual rates experienced
by some groups may be expected to depart from
the trend assumed. For instance, death rates of
middle-aged men have recently been stationary
because the increase in the death rate from
certain types of cancer and from circulatory

FUTURE POPULATION

diseases has been counterbalanced by reductions
from other causes. These reductions may not
continue indefinitely at a sufficient rate, and we
might even witness a rise in the total death rates
of these age groups. In the long term, however, it
is thought that the factors assumed give a
realistic measure of the rate of improvement to
be expected.

12 The population projection will extend for
forty years from mid-1958 and it must be decided
whether or not to assume the same rate of
mortality improvement over the full period. As a
starting point for the projection, mortality rates
were derived from the mean populations and
deaths in the five years 1953-57, producing
rates applicable to mid-1955. The mid-point of
the last quinquennium of the projection will be
to the end of 1995, so that the mortality forecast
must extend for forty and a half years. The
forty and a half year improvement factors are
shown in Table 2. Looking so far ahead there is
no reason to regard these as unreasonable and it
has therefore been decided to continue the trend.
13 Specimen values of mortality rates at mid1955 and end-1995 are shown below together

factors:

Future Births—Factors Affecting Numbers of
Births

14 It might at the outset be asked why the

number of births in future years should be any

different from the present annual numbers. At

its briefest, the answer to this question is that the

number of parents may change, or alternatively

that the numbers of children born to each parent
may change. A third possibility is that a change
may occur in the ages at which parents have their
children. For example, if there is a trend towards
earlier marriage and consequently earlier parenthood, then, other things being equal, the annual
number of births will go up. Our task is there
13

ER—D
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

fore to estimate as best we can the future numbers
of parents and thence the numbers of children
born to them, but perhaps the greatest problem
is to determine what is meant by the present
annual numbers of births from which we intend
to estimate any deviation.

15 As two parents are concerned in the birth
of every child it is open to us to base the estimates on future numbers of either parent, or both
parents. There are good reasons why the choice
should be made to base the estimates on women
alone, not least of these being that official
statistics of births are analysed according to the
age, etc., of the mother and not the father
(although this deficiency seems likely to be
remedied if a Bill at present before Parliament is
carried through). This decision enables us to
focus our attention on the numbers of women
between ages fifteen and forty-five, since
maternity at ages outside this range happens so
infrequently that it can for practical purposes
be ignored.

16 The total numbers of women aged fifteen to
forty-five will be available from the projection;
as a first approximation to the numbers of
births in future years, therefore, it might be
assumed that the ratio of births in a year to the
numbers of women aged fifteen to forty-five will
remain at its most recently recorded level. This,
however, would be much too crude because the
probability is not the same that each woman in
the group will bear a child. The probability will
vary according to her age, whether she is married,
for how long she has been married and how
many children there are already in the family.
For instance, statistics published by the Registrar
General show that fertility rates are significantly
higher at young ages than old, at short marriage
durations than long and that fertility of the
married is many times higher than the unmarried. These do not exhaust the possibilities,
but they are sufficient to exceed the bounds
of what it is practicable to allow for in the
calculations.

17 If there were no reason to suppose that the
distribution according to age, etc., would change
in future then this first approximation could be
regarded as a good estimate. It is known, however, that fluctuations in the annual numbers of

154

births in past years will result in a changing age
distribution, and that recent increases in
marriage rates will result in a group of women
of a particular age containing, in future, a higher
proportion married but at a higher average duration since marriage than in the past. These
variations at least should be allowed for in the
estimates. To go a stage further and attempt to
subdivide future numbers of married women at
age x and marriage duration in years according
to the number of children in the family would
involve an amount of work out of all proportion
to the results to be obtained.

Recent Fertility Experience
18 The annual numbers of births registered in
recent years have been as follows:

1951 680,000 1956 698,000
1952 673,000 1957 723,000
1953 682,000 1958 739,000
1954 673,000 1959 750,000
1955 665,000 (Provisional)

19 Since the period 1951-55, during which the
annual numbers varied little from an average of
675,000, there has been a significant upward
trend. The Registrar General’s Annual Statistical
Review for 1958 has not at the time of writing
been published, so the latest detailed statistics on
fertility available are those for 1957; Table 3
(p. 155) illustrates the changes which have taken
place between 1951 and 1957. Although the total
number of women between ages fifteen and fortyfive fell by about 5 per cent, the numbers married
actually increased slightly; the proportion
married increased for each age group, the largest
increase being found in age group 20-24. The
slight increase in the numbers married, however,
cannot account for the significant increase in
births which has taken place; the table shows
that this can be attributed to the increase in the
legitimate fertility rates (i.e. of married women)
between twenty and thirty years of age, which has
more than offset the slight fall at higher and lower
ages.

20 These figures indicate that:

(i) fewer woman are remaining unmarried
(ii) those who marry do so at a younger age, on
average, and
(iii) experience significantly higher fertility below
age thirty, i.e. at the shorter marriage durations, than hitherto.

21 It is difficult to foresee the consequences of
(iii). At one extreme, the view could be taken
that there is, at marriage, such a thing as an
intended completed family size which will be
reached earlier than before, and that fertility
at older ages and longer durations since marriage
will decline in future in compensation; in other
words, a “trend towards earlier parenthood” as
mentioned in paragraph 14. At the other
extreme, it might be assumed that fertility at
later marriage durations will be unaffected, or
even that it might go up in future on the grounds
that these new cohorts will continue to experience higher fertility throughout their married life.

22 The decline apparent in the fertility rates
for married women below age twenty and above
age thirty calls for further examination and this
can be obtained from Table KK in the Registrar
General’s Civil Volume which analyses fertility
by duration of marriage as well as age of mother.
It is found that the fertility rates have in fact
increased at almost all durations of marriage so
that the decline is due to a concealed higher
average duration since marriage brought about
by a past increase in marriage rates. (Table KK
related to maternity rates for women married
once only, but it is thought that a comparison
based on these data is adequate for our purpose.)

Proportions Married

23 In order that we may be able to use in the
estimates legitimate fertility rates specific for
both age of mother and duration of marriage,
we must arrange for the future numbers of
women 15-44 to be split between single and
married, and further, according to duration of

marriage. The proportions married in the required groupings in future years have been
computed on three different bases:

(a) Assuming marriage rates remain at the
1952-57 level. These marriage rates were
obtained from the proportions married in 1957
less the survivors of the proportions married in
1952 at an age five years younger adjusted
approximately for widowhood and divorce.

(b) Assuming marriage rates remain at the 1957
level. This was a more accurate calculation
in which factors were applied to the Net
Nuptiality Table in the 1951 Census Fertility
Volume so as to bring it to the level of the
1957 crude marriage rates.

(c) The proportions married above age twenty
five for all durations combined were taken as
in (b). Below age twenty-five, the proportions
were increased above (b) half way towards the
much higher proportions obtaining in the
United States of America in 1955.

24 The ultimate proportions married (which
will not be reached for more than twenty-five
years) on these bases are shown in Table 4.

It will be seen that all three bases produce a
proportion married about 0-91 at ages 40-44.
When 4 or 5 per cent is added for widows and
divorced, the proportion ever married becomes
95 per cent, which would appear to be about the
maximum possible.

25 In order to bridge the gap between the
present time and the ultimate marriage position,
it is necessary to estimate the proportions married
in age and duration groups in 1958. This has
been done approximately by splitting the 1957
proportions married in the first column of Table
4 by reference to the proportions: married in

reference to data of maternities of women
married once only in Tables II, JJ, and KK of the

as to build up to the correct rates for all durations combined shown in Table 3.

27 If these fertility rates are multiplied by the
ultimate proportions married according to age
and duration on each of the three marriage bases
described in paragraph 23, the sum of the

166

resulting products gives a measure of gross
reproduction, which when multiplied by a factor
(5S x 0-485 x 0-97 x 1-05) approximates to the
female Net Reproduction Rate. The factor
adjusts respectively for the five-year grouping,
for the proportion female among children born,
for approximately twenty-five years survivorship and for an addition of 5 per cent for
illegitimate births. A Net Reproduction Rate,
being based on a single year’s experience, is
now generally regarded as unsatisfactory, and
its place in fertility analysis has been taken by
the generation replacement rate. Since our
approximate N.R.R. relates to the ultimate
marriage position, however, the fertility is the
same whether summed over a particular year or
a generation and the two indexes are identical.
The ultimate N.R.R.s on the three marriage
bases are as follows:
MARRIAGE BASIS

(a) (c)
1952-57 1957 RATES ‘‘HIGH’’ RATES
Ultimate N.R.R. 1-13 1-15 1-21
28 The Net Reproduction Rate in England and
Wales was 1-15 in 1957 (and even higher, most
likely, in 1958 and 1959). Although this is the
same as the ultimate N.R.R. on basis (b) above
the two indexes are based on quite different
marriage distributions. A better comparison
would be with the General Replacement Rate
which the Registrar General estimates to be
1:01 on the basis of 1951-55 marriage and
fertility rates and 1950-52 mortality, and 1-07 if
the higher marriage rates of 1957 are used.
Further adjustment to the higher 1957 level of
fertility and the lower 1957 mortality, widowhood and divorce rates, would no doubt bring
this up to about the 1-15 arrived at by the
approximate methods described above.
AN ESTIMATE OF THE

29 In paragraph 21 the possibility was discussed that fertility at later marriage durations
might be expected to decline in future as a
consequence of the increase observed in 1957 in
the rates at early durations of marriage. To show
the effect of this, further work was done using
the 1957 fertility rates at durations 0-4, ninetenths of the 1957 rates at durations 5-9,
eight-tenths at durations 10-14 and seven-tenths
at higher durations. The result was a reduction
of 6 or 7 per cent in the ultimate N.R.R.s based
on 1957 fertility rates without adjustment. These
reductions adopted for durations five and over
are, of course, quite arbitrary.

Most Probable Marriage and Fertility Bases

30 It remains to consider the various marriage
and fertility bases in combination and to reach
a decision on the basis most likely to produce
the correct numbers of births in future years.

31 The lowest ultimate N.R.R. which would
seem reasonable at the present time would be a
return to the 1951-55 marriage and fertility rates
with a figure of 1-01. On the other hand, even
taking into account the present economic
prosperity and the likelihood that it will continue, it would seem doubly optimistic to assume
both that fertility rates at all durations of
marriage will continue at the 1957 level and that
marriage rates will increase beyond the 1957 rates
to the extent implicit in basis (c). This implies an
ultimate N.R.R. of 1-21.

32 It is fair to say that marriage rates at the
young ages have been increasing steadily since
1951-55, and they can reasonably be expected to
go om increasing. It is a matter of opinion
whether they will rise to the level implicit in
basis (c) above, but the latter is still a good way
short of the example set in the U.S.A. in 1955
and can hardly be called unrealistic. Nor should
W. S. Hocking’s work on the “decline in spinsterhood” be lost sight of; this draws attention to
the growing pressure on women to marry even
younger as a result of the excess of men among
persons reaching the adult ages. It would seem
quite moderate, therefore, to assume that the
1957 marriage rates will continue at ages up to
thirty. Above that age, some reduction might
seem probable to keep the proportion ever
marrying below the very high figure of 95 per

FUTURE POPULATION

cent noted in paragraph 24, but this has been
ignored in view of the relatively small contribution of these late marriages to the total
numbers of births.

33 If 1957 marriage rates are used in combination with 1957 fertility rates at short durations
declining progressively at higher durations as in
paragraph 29, an ultimate N.R.R. of 1-07 is
obtained. This would be quite a reasonable basis
to adopt; it is moderate in its assumptions both
as tegards marriage and fertility and could be
justified on the experience of past years. On the
other hand, it can be shown that the ultimate
family sizes of women marrying at different ages
implicit in the use of the 1957 fertility rates without adjustment are no bigger than recently
completed families. Nor would this basis make
any allowance for, as seems probable, a continuation of the trend towards early marriage.

34 Taking all things into consideration, it has
been decided to use a basis which implies an
approximate ultimate N.R.R. of 1-12. For
purposes of calculating the numbers of births this
has been taken as 1957 marriage rates and 1957
fertility rates, the latter reduced by 5 per cent at
marriage durations five and over. Illegitimate
births have been assumed constant at 35,000
per annum; this is close to the 5 per cent addition employed in the factor for obtaining the
approximate N.R.R. (see paragraph 27) and
avoids the apparent anomaly of increasing
illegitimate births at the same time as the
proportion remaining unmarried is declining.
The numbers of births in 1958, 1963, 1968 and
1973 on this basis are as follows (to go further,
children born after 1958 must be brought into

1958 709,000

35 The actual numbers of births in 1958 and
1959 are shown in paragraph 18 as 739,000 and
750,000 respectively, both considerably in
excess of the numbers calculated on the basis
adopted. This cannot be ignored but, equally, it
is difficult to see how to allow for it in a scientific
manner since no statistics are yet available to
show whether the excess is due principally to

marriage or to fertility factors. It might be
thought reasonable to assume that the extra
births have been “borrowed” from future years
and to make a deduction from later births as
calculated to compensate for this, but it would
seem just as reasonable to assume that they have

been deferred from earlier years. In the circumstances it has been assumed arbitrarily that
the numbers of births in the next few years will
decline from 750,000 in 1959 to 710,000 in 1963,
and will thereafter be as calculated. Apart from
1958-63 the number of births in a quinquennium

has been taken as five times the mean of the
annual numbers at the beginning and end.
Forty-eight and a half per cent of births have
been assumed to be female.

36 Bringing future births into the projection it
is possible to continue the calculations beyond
1973, producing the following annual numbers of
births:

1978 777,000
1983 796,000
1988 810,000
1993 826,000
1998 846,000

Migration

37 With some difficulty because of inadequate
statistics the Registrars-General are able to
estimate the net balance of migration by all
routes, sea and air. The table below shows
figures for recent years for England and Wales
given in the 1957 Commentary Volume and, for
comparison, figures for the whole of the United
Kingdom given in the Reports of the Oversea
Migration Board.

FUTURE POPULATION

38 The two sets of data relate to slightly
different periods. Nevertheless, it is clear that the
net migration from the United Kingdom is
principally from Scotland and Northern Ireland
and to allow in the projection for a number as
small as 6,000 migrants per annum from England
and Wales would not seem worth while, even if
it were decided that the experience of recent
years was a reliable guide to the future. It must
be remembered of course that these are net figures
and they should be tested to see that they do not
conceal large movements in opposite directions
in different age groups. Fortunately, in such
statistics as are published in the Reports of the
Oversea Migration Board there is nothing to
suggest that there is any sizeable such feature
which must be allowed for. It has therefore been
decided to make no allowance in the projection
for future migration.

Conclusion
39 The estimated future total population of
England and Wales in 1978 and 1998 calculated
on the bases described above is shown in Table
5 with, for comparison, some summary figures
from the “‘official” projection published in the
Registrar General’s Quarterly Return for December 1958. The main differences are briefly as
follows:
(a) Mortality is assumed to decline more quickly
in the “official” projection, particularly in the
case of females, as is evident from the 1998
numbers aged sixty and over.
-() Births do not increase to such a high level in
future in the “official”? projection.
Both projections, however, present a picture
of a total population increasing slowly and
continuously.
