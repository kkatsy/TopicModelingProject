RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

THE INTELLI
GENCE OF STUDENTS AND SIZE OF FAMILY
By F. W. WARBURTON

IMMELWEIT (1) found a significant
correlation of —-133 between size of
family and composite score in four
verbal and four non-verbal tests of intelligence for 408 students at the London School

the following mean scores for 481 students in
four technical colleges.

H. D. Wilcockson gave the untimed version of the 1938 Matrices non-verbal test to
fifty part-time technical students, of age

Manchester University obtained correlations

range 15-17, attending evening classes at
Stockport. Some students were attending
these courses on their own initiative, others
had been directed to attend by their parents
or employers. Mean test scores were :

The correlation between test score and size of family is low, negative and non-significant.

between the Moray House Adult 2 test and
size of family (700 students). Neither of
these correlations is significant.

In the course of two post-graduate researches being carried out in the School of
Education, Manchester University, correlations have been calculated between size of
family and the Matrices test* scores of
students in technical colleges and evening
institutes respectively. E. C. Venables found

* There are three main versions of the Matrices test :
(i) the 1947 series, which takes one hour; (ii) the 1938
series, lasting twenty minutes ; and (iii) the 1938 test,
untimed. The 1947 version is considerably more
difficult than the 1938, so that no direct comparison can
be made between marks scored in these tests.

Thus, in the experiments carried out at
Manchester University there is no definite
tendency for the more intelligent students to
come from small or large families.

These results give no indication of the
relationship between the size of the family
and its average intelligence since the courses
were not attended by all members of the

families concerned.
