THE KIN

OF GENIUS

A Study of the Families of Great Men
By W. T. J. GUN, F.R.Hist.S., F.S.G.

VER two-thirds of a group of great
() men of this country have had relatives of distinction. Of the men of
action in this group over three-quarters have
had kinsmen themselves recorded in the
Dictionary of National Biography, and so
have nearly three-quarters of the great
thinkers, and well over one-half of the
artistic geniuses.
The proportion of men in the street with
distinguished relatives is about one in five
hundred.

* * *

In the annexed table will be found the
names of 200 representative men and
women, taken from a period of 400 years,
A.D. 1500 to A.D. 1900, but limited to those
of British nationality. All consequently
appear in our Dictionary of National Biography (hereinafter referred to as D.N.B.),
and the table shows how many of these had
near relatives who themselves had separate
memoirs in D.N.B. (these will be referred to
as the D.N.B. relatives).

This test of a separate memoir in D.N.B.
is the best that can be taken ; it may indeed
be of doubtful value in any one case, but
when as many as 200 names are considered,
a very fair indication of the real position
is obtained.

For the purpose in hand it is, of course,
necessary that the two hundred selected
should be fully representative, and this, I
venture to think, will prove to be the case.
No complete agreement could be arrived at
as to the 200 most eminent names in the
country during the last 400 years, but I
should suppose that at least 150 of those set
out would appear in any list that might be
compiled. In the majority of cases the
individuals are so well known as to obviate
the necessity of adding Christian names, and

titles have been altogether omitted, as
irrelevant.

Owing to the uncertainty of medieval
genealogies, I have thought it best to commence with the year 1500; and I end with
the year 1900, as there are obvious difficulties in extending the list to those now living.
No one, therefore, is included whose main
achievements took place during the present
century.

As the list is based on D.N.B., certain
distinguished men of foreign birth are
included, who made their careers in this
country—Vandyke, Handel, and William
Herschell.

TYPES OF LEADERS

The list comprises three main divisions,
Leaders of Action, Leaders of Thought, and
Leaders of Art, arranged in each case
chronologically according to date of birth.
These three divisions correspond roughly to
three principal spheres of human achievement ; the first includes statesmen, generals,
admirals, Empire builders, explorers; the
second, scientists, inventors, philosophers,
historians; the third, poets, novelists,
painters, architects, musical composers,
actors. I have not inserted any who made
their names solely as commercial men, none
seem to be quite outstanding enough for the
purpose. Gresham and Rhodes, though
certainly in this category, had other claims
to distinction. Much of the national ability
however has been shown in commerce; and
among the D.N.B. relatives there have been
several successful business men, and still
more among relatives who do not appear in
D.N.B.

An athlete or two might have been included in the main list, but they do not seem
to fit well into any division. It may be
remarked, however, that the most notable of
. THE KIN OF GENIUS » 83

all, W. G. Grace, was certainly not alone in
cricketing ability in his family. There can
be no question, however, where to place most
of the names, though a few are rather on
the border-line. The varying figures as to
the D.N.B. relatives in these different divisions will, I think, be found to be of interest.

DEGREES OF KINSHIP

It is now proposed to explain the principles on which these D.N.B. relatives are
classified.

The nearest relatives to the central figure,
biologically speaking, are his brothers and
sisters, who alone fully share his descent.
The next group shares half his descent.
This group consists of the father and
mother, the children, half-brothers and
half-sisters, uncles and aunts, nephews and
nieces, and first cousins. Finally, a third
group share only one-quarter of the descent.
This includes grandparents, grandchildren,
great-uncles and aunts, great-nephews and
nieces, first cousins once removed and second
cousins. Beyond these the relationship becomes remote, and of little value from a biological point of view.

The first and second groups will be found
combined together under Category 1 in the
table, while the third group will be found
under Category 2. To have included the
first group, brothers and sisters, in a separate category, might have made the table
rather too complex.

It will be observed that there is in addition a further classification of Predecessors
and Successors. It is of special interest
to ascertain how far a great man had predecessors of note as compared with successors. In the case of the contemporary relatives, viz., brothers and sisters and the
various kinds of cousins, these are placed as
predecessors or successors in accordance with
whether they were born before or after the
leading figure of the connection.

This, it is hoped, fully explains the
principle on which the table is drawn up.

As has been already indicated, only those
relatives with definitely separate memoirs
in D.N.B. are included. In various instances what may be termed sub-memoirs of

relatives are given in D.N.B., and are separately indexed in the epitome of that work;
but in most of these cases it is quite clear
that no memoirs would have been given,
but for the connection with the principal
biographee. With one exception, no relative has been included in the table who is the
subject merely of a sub-memoir. ‘The exception occurs in the case of the sisters of
Charlotte Bronté. Emily and Anne have no
separate memoirs, but Emily at least had
such obvious claims to distinction apart from
Charlotte, that in this case I have broken
through the rule.

A difficulty arises with regard to those
successors now living or deceased since
1921, the final date of the latest issue of
D.N.B. In those cases no memoir could as
yet have been published in that work, but
I have included those relatives who, it seems
likely, will ultimately so appear. In several
of these cases there have already been
D.N.B. relatives, and only the following
members of the two hundred would altogether lack such relatives if my prognostications are at fault—Malthus, Franklin,
Bright, Dickens, and Huxley. In the case
of Huxley there can be no doubt as to ultimate inclusion, the others are:
Malthus ... Sir Reginald Bray

Sir Edward Bray
Franklin Present Lord Tennyson great-nephew
Bright Lord Aberconway nephew
Dickens Sir Henry Dickens son

In this connection, it is however to be
observed that the last volume of D.N.B.
shows a curtailment in insertions as compared with previous issues. Otherwise, I
think, Sir George Wolseley, General and
K.C.B., and the actors H. B. and Laurence
Irving, would have received notices, and
Lord Wolseley and Sir Henry Irving would
not accordingly have appeared in the table
as devoid of D.N.B. relatives.

DRAKE AND HAWKINS

Passing to the relationships in general
there are, so far as I am aware, only two
cases of actual uncertainty, those of Drake
and Knox. ‘The five relatives of Drake
indicated all belonged to the distinguished
Hawkins family. There is no sort of doubt

great-nephews
84

that some kinship existed: John Hawkins
in his will made a bequest to ‘‘ my very good
cousin Sir Francis Drake,’’ but the exact
degree has never been established. It 1s,
however, fairly safe to presume that it would
not be more remote than Category 2.

In the case of John Knox, a namesake, a
notable Presbyterian divine of the early
seventeenth century, is generally considered
to have been a nephew of the reformer, but
this also has not been absolutely proved.

The question of true paternity remains
for consideration; but in all these cases
where D.N.B. relatives can be traced, I can
only find doubts cast on the paternity in one
instance, that of Horace Walpole. He
certainly was most probably the son of
Carr, Lord Hervey, but, apart from the
fact that he had in any event D.N.B. relatives on his mother’s side, a Hervey paternity would in effect give him as many such
relatives as a Walpole.

THE PERCENTAGE OF ABILITY

It is now proposed to analyse in detail the
figures arrived at in the table.

First and most interesting is the total
number with D.N.B. relatives, amounting as
it does to 137 out of the 200. ‘This is undoubtedly a higher figure than most people
would have thought likely. It is well over
two-thirds, and would remain over twothirds if all the doubtful cases just discussed
were deducted.

The Leaders of Action furnish, as is to
be expected, the highest proportion, no less
than 58 out of 75, or 77 per cent.; the
Leaders of Thought show 38 out of 53, or 72
per cent., while the Leaders of Art show 41
out of 72, or 58 per cent. The last-named
bring down the average, but even in this
division the proportion with one or more
D.N.B. relatives is well over one-half. |

Next for consideration is the proportion
of the 137 who can show a predecessor or
predecessors in D.N.B.:

Leaders of Action ... 47 out of 75 ... 63 per cent.
Leaders of Thought ... 25 out of 53 ... 47 per cent.
Leaders of Art ... 30 out of 72 ... 41 per cent.

Total 102 out of 200 ... 51 per cent.

Those with one or more D.N.B. predecessors are therefore almost exactly one-half

THE EUGENICS REVIEW,

of the total of 200, leaving 35 of the 137 with
successors only. The Leaders of Action
are even in this respect well over one-half,
but both the other two divisions fall below
this proportion.

The total number of D.N.B. relatives of
the two hundred is 601, giving an average
of almost exactly 3 to each. The Leaders
of Action show an average of almost exactly
4 apiece, the Leaders of Thought a little
under 3 apiece, the Leaders of Art, a little
over 2 apiece.

Of the 601 relatives, 256 were predecessors and 345 successors. From a biological
point of view it might seem that these should
be about equal, and the greater number of
successors is probably due to advantages enjoyed owing to relationship to the central
figure. It is to be noted, however, that this
would apply only to the surplus of 89. The
256 predecessors could not have owed anything to the central figure, and it may be
presumed that an equal number of successors, viz., 256, would likewise owe their
position primarily to their own abilities.

The position of the three divisions in
respect of the total number of predecessors
and successors is as follows:

Proportion of
Predecessors Successors predecessors

Leaders of Action 133 ... 163 81 per cent.
Leaders of Thought 56 ... 86 65 per cent.
Leaders of Art 67 ... 96 69 per cent,

It is to be noted that the proportion of predecessors is much higher in the case of the
Leaders of Action than in either of the
others. This is no doubt partly due to the
fact that statesmen, to a greater extent than
other notable men, have sprung from families which had already achieved distinction.
It would also, however, tend to show that the
influence of public men on the careers of
their successors has not been notably greater
than the influence of men of distinction in
other walks of life.

GALTON CONFIRMED

Turning now to the categories of relatives
we find that out of the total of 601, 369 or
62 per cent. belong to Category 1, the
nearer relatives, and 232 or 38 per cent.
to Category 2. This is in complete accordTHE KIN OF GENIUS 85

ance with Galton’s theory that the nearer
relatives of a great man will be found on the
whole to be of more distinction than the
more distant.

The proportions in this respect in the
division are as follows:

Leaders of Action Category 1 184 62 p.c.
Category 2 112 38 p.c.
Leaders of Thought Category 1 82 57 p.c.
Category 2 60 43 p.c.
Leaders of Art Category I 103 64 p.c.
Category 2 36 p.c.

The proportions, it will be observed, do
not differ very much in the three divisions,
which indicates that the men of action have
not influenced the careers of their immediate
relatives to any greater extent than have the
others.

In considering the proportion as ——
Categories 1 and 2, it is important to observe
that the nearer relatives can be traced with
greater ease than can the more distant ; and
the proportion of Category 2 is probably
therefore really somewhat higher than the
figures indicate.* In this connection it is to
be remarked that the total number of 601
D.N.B. relatives is a minimum, and could
no doubt be somewhat extended by further
research.

Having regard to the fact that the positions of parents and children have been
habitually over-emphasized, it may be of
interest further to classify Category 1, according to exact relationship :

Brothers 60 Nieces “ 6
Sisters 7 Half-brothers 3
Fathers 43 Half-sisters I
Mothers ... 3 Uncles 40
Sons . ... 64 Aunts 3
Daughters _ - 4 First cousins 74
Nephews ... ... 61 - at

369

While the total number of children thus
exceeds the total number of parents, there
is no real difference between the actual number of members of the two hundred with
distinguished parents and children respectively, as the excess in the number of children is occasioned by the inclusion in
D.N.B. of more than one son in certain

° We must also remember that a man usually has
more distant than near relatives, and that the

eee proportion among the latter is therefore an
ication of the strength of biological kinship.

 

and John Hampden, first cousins;

instances. Of those with fathers in D.N.B.,
the mothers of two, Bacon and Sheridan, are
separately in that work; Dufferin’s mother
is included, but not his father, making a
total of 44 with a parent or parents in
D.N.B., ‘while 41 have a child or children,
and 44 have one or more brothers or sisters.
This correspondence is very remarkable,
and indicates a practically exact equality of
chance as to whether the father, brother or
son of a great man attains distinction.

The main facts of the position as disclosed
by the table may now be summarized. Out
of 200 men of the first note, over two-thirds
have relatives in D.N.B. Over three-quarters of Leaders of Action have had such
relatives, nearly three-quarters of the
Leaders of Thought, and well over one-half
of the Leaders of Art. One-half of the two
hundred have had predecessors in D.N.B.
The nearer relatives exceed the next group
in the proportion of about three-fifths to
two-fifths.

THE ISOLATION OF GENIUS

It is in the division Leaders of Art that
most of those usually styled geniuses occur ;
and again and again one hears it declared
that geniuses are quite isolated in distinction
in their families. Examination shows that
this is far indeed from being invariably the
case.

As is to be expected, only a few of the
selected two hundred are themselves interrelated within the degrees under consideration. ‘The instances in question are, Burleigh and his son Robert Cecil, the latter
being also first cousin of Bacon; Cromwell
Robert
and Horace Walpole, father and son (but
doubtful) ;- Chatham and Pitt, father and
son; William and John Herschell, father
and son; Wellesley and Wellington,
brothers; George and Stratford Canning,
first cousins; Wedgwood and Darwin,
grandfather and grandson, the latter being
also first cousin of Galton.

All the above are therefore to be found
among the relatives as well as in the main
list, but the former contain in addition many
other names of great note.
86

There are four Lord Chancellors, King,
Cowper, Brougham, and Cranworth. Among
relatives of Leaders of Action may be found
John Hawkins, Charles Wesley, Charles
and William Napier, Samuel Wilberforce,
James Ross, Lady Eastlake, Mrs. Norton,
Henry Labouchere, Arthur Balfour, and
Austen and Neville Chamberlain; among
relatives of Leaders of Thought, Robert
Adam, William Hunter, Joanna Baillie,
Robert Stephenson, Marc Brunel, John J.
Lister, J. A. Symonds, James Mill, W. S.
Palgrave, W. B. Maxwell, Maurice Baring,
George Trevelyan; among relatives of
Leaders of Art, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, John P. Kemble, Edward W. Lane,
Charles Kean, Lord Coleridge, William
Richmond, Giles Scott, Thomas Arnold,
Mrs. Humphrey Ward, Christina Rossetti.

On the other hand, some of the D.N.B.
relatives undoubtedly found their way into
that work through the fortune of circumstances only. But after making all allowance for this and the effect of family influence generally, the great majority were
unquestionably men and women of ability.

THE REMOTER RELATIVES

It is to be observed that in several cases
in the table where the D.N.B. relatives are
few in number, several additional names
would appear if a degree or two of relationship more remote were admitted. This is
notably the case with Dryden, Swift, St.
Vincent, Nelson, John Moore, Walter Scott,
Byron, Palmerston, Manning, Richmond,
and Dufferin.

The intention of this article is to ascertain
how far the great men of our own country
have sprung from families otherwise of some
note. The table will show that it is hardly
necessary for this purpose to examine every
case individually, certainly not those, generally speaking, where more than one D.N.B.
relative occurs. In these, some ability in
the family, apart from the central figure,
may clearly be counted as proved.

It is proposed, however, in a subsequent
article to give more detailed consideration to
all those cases where no D.N.B. relatives
appear, with some investigation of those

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

which show only one such relative, with a
view to ascertaining whether family ability
cannot be traced in many cases where its
existence is not at first sight so obvious.
