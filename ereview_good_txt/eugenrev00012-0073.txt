The Numbers of the Unmarried

SOME FACTS

AS IT IS well known that marriage rates have
risen in England and Wales, and that earlier
marriage has become more popular, it should
come as no surprise that bachelors and spinsters
have become scarcer. The proportions of the
unmarried to all persons of the sex at ages 20-39
have changed as follows over the past thirty
years:

MEN WOMEN
1936 0-44 0-40
1941 0-38 0-33
1946 0-38 0-31
1951 0:36 0:27
1956 0-34 0:23
1961 0-32 0:21
1966 (provisional) 0-32 0-20

Although widowed and divorced persons are
included in these figures, their numbers are
relatively insignificant and do not influence the
result to any degree.

Having regard to the normal age at marriage,
which is older for men than for women, the
excess of the figures in the first column over those
in the second is to be expected. It is interesting
to note, however, that the reduction in time in
the numbers of the young unmarried has been
much greater for women than for men. This is
because the relative numbers of the sexes have
changed: in earlier days, the supply of men of
marriageable age was depleted by emigration
and by excess mortality, but these causes of
depletion have largely been removed, with the
result that there has been a relatively greater
improvement in marriage prospects for women
than for men. Consequently, fewer women than
men remain unmarried—a reversal of an earlier
pattern.

How far are these developments reflected in
the data for other countries ? Some information
about proportions married at successive ages is
available for a number of countries from the
Demographic Year Book of the United Nations

Organization. It relates to the censuses taken in
or around the years 1950 and 1960. Unfortunately, a number of areas of particular
interest supplied information for one of these
years and not the other, with the result that a
comparison in time is not possible. A survey of
ten countries for which adequate statistics are
available shows the following features:

i, the age of women at marriage is younger
than that for men in all cases;

ii. there has been a move towards earlier
marriage throughout Europe, but an
opposite tendency is observable in parts of
Asia, e.g. Japan and Thailand.

ili. a reduction in spinsterhood greater than
that in bachelorhood is observable in a
few countries, e.g. in Poland, but is not
general; in the United States of America
the tendency appears to be in the opposite
direction.

The point to remember in connection with (iii)
is that countries from which large scale emigration to the United States occurred would be
expected to experience the same effects from the
cessation of that migration as Britain has, while
as the receiving country the USA would be
expected to exhibit a contrary movement.

A topic of current importance in Britain is the
effect on marriage rates of the exceptionally
large numbers of births immediately after the
Second World War. This now shows as an
increase in the number of young men and
women aged up to twenty. Because men marry
later than women, the boys and girls in this
group will not, in general, marry each other.
Consequently some disturbances in marriage
rates, and in the numbers of the unmarried, are
to be expected owing to the inequality between
the sexes in the numbers available for marriage.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Some data on this subject are set out in the two
tables which follow:

ENGLAND AND WALES
MARRIAGES OF GIRLS AGED 16 TO MEN AGED

16 17 18 19 20and over
1962 148 605 1127 1201 3087
1963 217 700 1393 1494 3588
1964 180 802 1306 1417 3203

The supply of girls and boys available for
marriage at age sixteen increased from 1962 to
1963 by some 15 per cent and fell slightly from
1963 to 1964. As a result, marriages to men of
all ages increased between 1962 and 1963 and
fell again from 1963 to 1964. The single exception
is that marriages to men aged seventeen rose
again between 1963 and 1964; this is no doubt
attributable to the fact that there were more

236

boys aged seventeen in 1964 than in 1963 because
of the “bulge” in births in 1946-47.

MARRIAGES OF BOYS AGED 16 TO WOMEN AGED

16 17 18 19 20and over
1962 148 112 54 16 9
1963 217 129 61 31 18
1964 180 157 54 26 24

The corresponding data for boys marrying at
age sixteen exhibit similar features, the only
exception being an increase between 1963 and
1964 in the small number of marriages to women
aged twenty or over.

Such fluctuations may well have a temporary
rather than a lasting effect, although “some
American sociologists have suggested that the
corresponding feature in the USA may give rise
to a more permanent increase in the proportion
of women unmarried.
