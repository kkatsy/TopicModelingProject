Births in Great Britain

SOME

[ NUMBERS OF births in all parts of
| the United Kingdom have risen steadily
during the past five years and are now not
far below the level of the peak of 1946-48, so
frequently thought of as an isolated wave or
“bulge” passing through successive age-groups
in successive years. The course of events has
been as follows:

Year Number of live births
(U.K.) (Thousands)
1930-34 (average 731
1935-39 (average) 724
1940 702
1941 696
1942 772
1943 811
1944 878
1945 796
1946 955
1947 1025
1948 905
1949 855
1950 818
1951 797
1952 793
1953 804
1954 795
1955 789
1956 825
1957 851
1958 869
1959 880
1960 916
1961 (forecast) 940

The “boom in babies” since 1955, as it has
been called, was unexpected and it is uncertain
whether it will continue. It could be attributable
to a genuine increase in fertility, leading in due
course to larger families, and this in turn might
be a consequence of earlier marriages and perhaps due also to a feeling of increasing prosperity.

FACTS

Whether such a permanent development may be
expected is not clear at present and can hardly
be certain for some years yet. The recent rise in
births could equally be attributable to shortterm effects of an economic character, or to
couples marrying younger and having their
children earlier in married life than before; the
scope for further such acceleration is clearly
limited.

In either event it seems likely at least that the
level of births—if any sort of “level” is maintained
over a period—will now be above that of the
early nineteen-fifties. This in itself should lead,
in the absence of any notable changes in mortality
or migration, to a somewhat larger growth of
population as a whole in future. Instead of a
net six million more persons during the next
thirty years, as officially forecast two years ago,
an increase of eight million is now expected.
The average annual growth rate until the end of
the century might thus be nearer 0-5 per cent
than 0:4 per cent. This is still far below the
world average of 12 per cent per annum, and
less even than the growth rates of most individual countries, but it seems not improbable
that Britain is going to participate a little more
than before in the general upward trend of
numbers.

It should perhaps be added that the increases
in the numbers of births are much too large to
be accounted for by the recent influx of Commonwealth citizens into this country, which in
any event has been largely balanced by outward
migration.
