~POPULATION TRENDS IN PALESTINE
By D. V. GLASS

T ‘HE question of the relative rates of
growth of the two major communities
in Palestine—Moslems and Jews—has

long been of special interest to demographers.
Here in a small country, with a total population of about 1-76 millions, in which thirty
years ago the oriental Jews probably had a
culture pattern not dissimilar to that of the
Moslems, a wave of migration of European
Jews has, at least potentially, brought with
it important elements of. Westernization.
According to the Anglo-American Committee
of Enquiry, three-quarters of the growth of
the Jewish population, from 84,000 in 1922
to 554,000 at the end of 1944, is due to
immigration. For the Moslems only about
19,000 out of a total increase from 589,000
to 1-061 millions during the same period is
accounted for by that factor.* With so large
and rapid an infhix of new cultural elements,
it is clearly of great interest to know the

course of fertility and mortality of the two

communities and to see how far the communities influence each other demographically. Upon being able to gauge their interaction depends our ability to estimate, in
realistic terms, the future total population of
the country and its distribution as between
the different communities.

Development of Census and Vital Statistics

There have been few modern studies of |

population trends in Palestine, and this is at
least partly due to the unsatisfactory nature,
until quite recent times, of the basic statis
tics. The first modern census was taken in .

1922 and was not wholly satisfactory. The
I93I Census was a great improvement and,

-even though there were evident errors in the

statements of ages, especially for Moslems,
the results of that census form the starting
point for relatively accurate demographic
analysis. But the plan of following the 1931
census with quinquennial censuses did not
materialize, being prevented by political
disturbances in 1936 and by war in 1941.
Thus for fifteen years the annual estimates
of the population have been compiled
primarily by extending the 1931 figures on
the basis of recorded births, deaths and
migration, with some allowance for illegal
migration from 1939 onwards. Using this
method, with no allowance for illegal migration, between 1922 and 1931 showed a discrepancy for the Jewish population of only
about 2,000, as compared with a total of
about 175,000 Jews enumerated in 1931.*
This is surprisingly small, especially in view
of the deficiencies of the 1922 census and of.
vital statistics before 1931, and the apparently small error may perhaps give support
to the contention of the Jewish Agency that
the Jewish population was understated by
the 1931 census.f In any case, illegal
migration is likely to have been of greater
importance since 1931 and there is a longer
period during which errors may have
cumulated. In recent years there have also
been independent estimates issued by the
Food Controller, but it is likely that, for
obvious reasons, these are inflated.{ Annual
estimates of the settled Moslem population
are also liable to error. Vital statistics for
them may still be incomplete—though it is
possible that, in view of rationing, recent
birth registration is rather more than com

always higher than those of the Government Statistician. The estimate for the end of 1944 amounted to
565,000, as compared with the original official estimate
of 529,000.

was 568,000, excluding enlisted soldiers (who are
included in the other estimates). The Government

Statistician has now issued a revised de facto estimate of
554,000 for the end of 1944. (Survey, p. 163.)

plete—and there is uncontrolled and unrecorded migration across the land frontiers.
It is usually believed that clandestine
migration is much less important for Moslems
than for Jews and there are good a priori and
other reasons for this belief. Nevertheless,
it is possible that illegal Arab migration has
increased since the war. As regards the
smaller groups in the country the postcensal estimates are probably still less
reliable, while for the nomads it is customary
simply to keep to the 1931 figure of 67,000.

Compulsory vital registration in Palestine
dates from an Ordinance of 1922, but it is
doubtful if either births or deaths were
recorded with reasonable completeness before 1928, while marriage statistics are still
rather unsatisfactory. For the nomads, vital
registration is ineffective, so that demographic analysis must, in any case, be
confined to the settled population. In
addition, the difficulties of obtaining correct
age statements in vital registration, especially
for the Moslems, are similar to those found
in the census.* The resultant errors undoubtedly reduce the validity of age-specific
fertility rates and it is possible that the
peculiarly high fertility rates found for
certain age-groups of Moslem women in very
recent years are in reality due to a combination of errors in age statements in census and
vital records. Vital registration is improving
both in completeness and in the range of data
covered, and birth statistics, for example,
are now available by religious group, age of
parents, order of birth and duration of
marriage. In combination with the next
census, which is due to be taken in the
autumn of 1946, it should be possible to
undertake detailed studies of variations in
fertility between groups and over time,
especially as the census schedule itself will
contain questions on the total number of

children ever born and the duration of the

present marriage. It may be that 1946 is an

of ages, see Special Bulletin No. 21, Department of
Statistics (Government of Palestine), 1945, which gives

economic conditions in five Arab villages. The problems
involved in obtaining the ages of Moslems are discussed
in pp. 23-9 of the Bulletin.

unfortunate choice for a country in which, to
ensure the success of the census, the cooperation of the various communities is
peculiarly necessary and may not be very
easy to gain. But demographers must pin
their hopes on the census. Until the results
of the census are available, all calculations
based on post-censal population estimates
must be regarded as provisional and liable
to an increasing margin of error as they come
nearer to the present time.

But in spite of the provisional nature of
some of the calculations, it is still of interest
to draw attention to them, especially as the
Anglo-American Committee’s references to
population are so compressed as scarcely to
do justice to the subject. The rest of this
note will therefore consider some of the
recent work on the prospective growth of the
Moslem and Jewish populations.

Early Studies of Population Trends

Earlier official reports on Palestine were
somewhat crude in their approach to the
question of population trends. The Shaw
Report assumed various crude rates of
natural increase for the population as a
whole, and various annual amounts of
Jewish immigration.* The Peel Report
assumed that the Arab population would
grow in accordance with a logistic curve,
rising from 0-943 millions in 1936 to 1-821
millions in 1970, and that the Jewish population would maintain an annual crude rate of
natural increase of 21-01 per thousand,
superimposed upon which were various
hypotheses regarding the annual intake of
migrants. Thus with no immigration the
Jewish population would grow from 0-373
millions to 0-757 millions between 1936 and
1970, while with 60,000 immigrants a year
the Jewish population by 1970 would amount
to 3:735 millions.t But these methods of
estimation do not take into account in any
adequate way the combined influences of
fertility and mortality and, especially if

applied in long-term estimates, may give
quite unrealistic results. .

An attempt to investigate fertility differences between the major communities in
Palestine was made, on lines similar to those
of a fertility census, between October 1931
and February 1932. The Office of Statistics
issued, through “officers of the public
service, to members of the medical profession,
and to persons interested in social matters,”’
personal schedules containing questions on
religion, ages of husband and wife, duration
of marriage, numbers of children ever born
alive, of still-born children and of surviving
children. The enquiry appears to have been
voluntary and the response was very poor.
About 40,000 schedules were issued and
“intelligible returns ’’ were made for only
4551 families, comprising 2,724 Moslem,
695 Christian and 1,132 Jewish.* There is
no account of the method of selecting the
sample and no analysis of the bias of the
small percentage of respondents, so that it is
difficult to evaluate the results of the survey.
However, the results showed, among other
things, that in families of parents who had
been living together for thirty-three or more
years, the average number of children ever
born alive per hundred families was 844 for
Moslems, 787 for Christians, 630 for Oriental
Jews and 673 for Western Jews. For
Moslems, not very different results were
shown by the social and economic survey of
five Arab villages carried out in 1944 by the
Department of Statistics. The latter survey
was undertaken as much to see what procedures could be used in investigating Arab
life and what difficulties would arise, as
actually to collect new data. But the villages
were selected with a view to their representativeness of the typical cereal-growing Arab
village and, bearing in mind the smallness of
the numbers involved, the material is of some
interest. The data on fertility showed that
for women married once only and aged 43

* In distributing the schedules “ there was a request
that a good proportion of the slips might be completed
in respect of families in which the wife was aged 45
years or more and therefore was reaching the end of her
reproductive period.’’ See Special Bulletin No. 3, “‘ The

Fertility of Marriage in Palestine,’’ Office of Statistics,
Jerusalem, June 1939, p. 2. ‘

years and over at the time of the survey, the
average total number of live-born children
per woman was practically 8-o. Among this
group of women (93 in all) there was no
childlessness, and in fact among all women
married once only and aged 23 years or more
at the time of the survey there were only ro
cases of childlessness in a total of 385 women.
It is scarcely necessary to emphasize that
these figures indicate a high fertility.*

So far as the overall official statistics of
Palestine are concerned, the first analysis of
the reproductive trends of the two major
communities was undertaken by Dr. Hinden. f
Using substitute methods, as the distribution
of births by maternal age was not available
for the years concerned, she calculated
approximate gross and net reproduction
rates for Moslems and Jews in 1931. She
found gross rates of 3°33 for Moslems and
1-61 for Jews, while the net rates were about
1-88 and 1-36 respectively.{ Her discussion
of future population growth in Palestine was
based exclusively on the implications of these
results, assuming that the stable rates of
growth indicated would apply immediately,
without the distorting effect of a transition
period. This assumption was made because
of the lack of any published post-censal
estimates of the population by age and sex
and, in fact, concentration upon the 1931
position was almost inevitable for that
reason. It is very difficult for a private
research worker to construct reliable post
* Special Bulletin No. 21, p. 20. It is perhaps a little
surprising that the fertility indicated was not still
higher. For example, there were no cases of women who
had had more than fourteen live-born children. Apart
from the question of faulty memory, it 1s possible that
children dying at or shortly after birth were recorded
as still births, the rate for which seems to have been
very high. Mills found (Special Bulletin No. 3, p. 15)
for his couples with marriage duration of thirty-three
or more years, that, in addition to the 844 live-born
children per 100 Moslem families, still births amounted
to about a further 10 per cent. |

¢ Recalculating the rates for Moslems on the basis of
the age-specific fertility rates of 1941-2, to which
reference will be made later, gives slightly lower figures,
but the differences are not important. But the rates
for Jews, as will be seen later, are significantly different
from the results obtained by the Department of
Statistics.
82 _ THE EUGENICS REVIEW

censal estimates by age and sex for a country
in which migration is an important element
in population growth, and especially when
there is unrecorded clandestine immigration.
Yet in speculating upon future growth in
Palestine it is clearly. most important to take
into account the developments in fertility
and mortality since 193I.

Recent Work on Population Growth

In the absence of appropriate post-censal
population estimates Notestein and Jurkat,
in their study of Palestine, made use of crude
birth and death rates and infant mortality
rates, through drawing attention to the unsatisfactory nature of the two former rates.*
These two authors‘argued that there has been
a similar decline in mortality for both Jews
and Moslems, though regional figures suggest
that ‘“‘in the areas with substantial Jewish
minorities, mortality was declining more
rapidly among non-Jews than among Jews.”
So far as infant and child mortality is con
cerned, this is supported by a recent study |

by Bachi and Kallner,f and it is particularly
important in considering how far Western
influences may reduce Moslem mortality in
the future. For example, the Department of
Statistics life table for Moslem women in
-1930-2 shows an expectation of life at age ro
of about 54 years, less than five years below
that of England and Wales for the same date.{
Even allowing for some exaggeration in the
Moslem life table, it nevertheless shows the
potential effect of reductions in infant and
child mortality among Moslems, for the
relevant expectation of life at birth was only
about 42 years, as compared with almost
63 years for England and Wales.

On fertility, Notestein and Jurkat inferred
from the course of the crude birth rates that
there had been a decline among both Jews
and Moslems, though greater among the
former. Their views was: “‘ Part of the
decline [among Moslems] may actually have

been due to changing age distributions, as the
short cohorts born during the First World
War were coming into the childbearing
period. However, it seems unlikely that this
explains the entire drop, and virtually certain
that fertility actually declined. It is fair to
conclude that even in the short span of
modernization, the Moslem birth rate was
beginning to respond downward.” This
conclusion has, of course, an important
bearing upon the relative future contributions of the two main communities to the
population of Palestine. But other evidence
suggests that the fall in Moslem fertility is
illusory and that, instead, the course of
fertility since 1931 has swung even more in
favour of Moslem reproduction than Notestein and Jurkat believed to be the case.

The point is that the crude birth and death
rates shown in Table I have become increasingly warped by changes in the age structure
of the respective populations. In the case of
the Moslems, for whom population growth
has been almost entirely by natural increase
—even supposing there has been an increase
in illegal immigration—the reductions in
infant and child mortality will have swollen
the proportion of young children in the
population. At the same time, as Notestein
and Jurkat pointed out, the girls aged 10-19
years in 1931 would, as they passed into the

adult age-groups, lessen the numbers of

potential mothers. By 1941, therefore, the
Moslem population, which even in 1931 was
less favourable, in its age composition, to
fertility than the Jewish population, would

* Statistical Abstract of Palestine, 1942, pp. 13-14.
POPULATION TRENDS IN PALESTINE 83

be still less so. For the Jewish population, on

the other hand, the continuous flow of
immigrants in the adult ages would maintain
the relatively favourable age structure—that
is, favourable from the point of view of
fertility. This is shown in Table II, which
summarizes some of the relevant statistics.
Taking into account the large volume of
immigration—there were about 220,000 registered Jewish immigrants between 1931 and
1940—the figures suggest that by 1941 the
population was not significantly less favourable in its age structure than in I93I.

The level of Moslem fertility in 1941-2
may be calculated by making use of an estimate of the age-distribution of the Moslem
population of Palestine as at the end of 1941,
prepared by the Central Bureau of Medical
Statistics of the Haddasah Medical Organization. Though, in view of the difficulties
mentioned earlier, the estimate cannot be
regarded as more than approximate, there is
no reason to doubt its general validity.§
Based on that estimate and the births and
deaths from the relevant issues of the Annual
Bulletin of Vital Statistics, the gross reproduction rate for Moslems in 1941-2 was 3°91
and the net rate 2-48, as compared with
Dr. Hinden’s rates for 1931 of 3:33 and 1°88
respectively. Even assuming that the postcensal estimates of the Moslem population
are somewhat understated, there is no reason
to believe that the overall fertility of Moslem

women has declined and it is probable that
there has been some increase since 1931,
though perhaps not as much as indicated by

the rise in the gross reproduction rate. As

regards the net reproduction rate, there
seems no reason to doubt that it had risen
substantially and that by 1941-2 it was one
of the highest found at any time or in any
place. It implies a rate of growth of almost
150 per cent in each generation, and
Table III indicates how the Moslem population would increase if the fertility and
mortality of 1941-2 were maintained. <

The above figures do not, of course, constitute a reasoned forecast, but simply an
estimate based on specific assumptions and
are designed to show what would follow from
the continuance of the stated levels of
fertility and. mortality. What they do
suggest is that in the absence of any decline
in Moslem fertility and of Jewish immigratien, the proportion of Jews to the total
population of Palestine would fall quite
considerably by 1971.

Current Official Studies of Reproductive Trends

Rather more elaborate calculations have
been prepared by the Palestine Department
of Statistics, based on more comprehensive
material than is available in published form
at present, and the subsequent Tables summarize the main results. f

* The estimate was computed by quinquennial agegroups and for every fifth calendar year beginning with
1941. Life Tables were constructed for 1941-2 and
show an expectation of life at birth of 48-2 years for
Moslem females and 47°4 years for Moslem males. In
view of the unsatisfactory nature of the basic data,
these life tables cannot be regarded as more than
reasonable approximations, though they agree fairly
well with the tables of the Department of Statistics.

not been sufficient to keep the net reproduction rate constant. The ratio between the net
reproduction rates of Moslems and Jews was
substantially higher in 1942 than in 1931.
In 1943 and 1944 there appear to have been
very substantial rises in fertility among both
communities, but even though the rates for
those years are somewhat dubious, because
of the unreliability of the estimates of the
size and age-structure of the populations,
they do not suggest any significant change in
the trend of the ratios between Moslem and
Jewish replacement.

With the above material—though in considerably more detail—as background, the
Department of Statistics has prepared: a
series of estimates of the future population of
Palestine. But because of the uncertainty of
the most recent statistics and, in any case, of
the short period during which the census and
vital statistics of the country have been
reasonably complete and. accurate, the
Department ‘was unwilling to suggest any
specific trends in fertility or mortality as
being most likely to obtain. Instead,
estimates were prepared on various assumptions in order to indicate a range of possibilities. Table V summarizes the main points of
the estimates of the Moslem and Jewish
populations. In order not to cloud the issue
still further, immigration has been excluded
from the hypotheses, and the results derive
exclusively from the assumed fertility and
mortality rates.

It is perhaps a little unfortunate that the
hypotheses for the Jews should, in part, have
made use of the uncertain statistics for 1943
and 1944, for the significance of the apparent
increases in fertility in those years is by no
means clear. But the inclusion of these years
provides an indication of what would happen
with the maintenance of a very high rate of
fertility among the Jews.* On any of the
above assumptions, however, it is clear that
the ratio of Moslems to Jews would increase
quite considerably by 1960—from about’1-9

_ to about 2°3.° Yet it would not require much

immigration to redress the balance. Assuming that immigrants had the same fertility
and mortality as is postulated for the Jews in
Estimate A, 100,000 immigrants entering at
the beginning of 1947 would, by the beginning of 1960, yield a total population of
about 134,000. This addition to the basic
population in 1960, according to estimate A,
would be almost enough to maintain the
ratio of Moslems to Jews obtaining in 1945.

-* The years 1943-4 have been excluded from the
fertility assumptions for the Moslems, as the Department of Statistics believes that the extremely high
fertility rates at ages 20-24 and 25-29 years in that
period are in large part due to an underestimation of
the numbers of women in those groups.

¢ On the other hand, an immigration of 100,000 per
year for seven years, beginning with 1947, would, on
the same terms, be sufficient to bring up the Jewish

population to the size of the Moslem population by
1960.

The Future Course of Fertility and Mortality

Although the above calculations are of
considerable interest, they do not answer the
main question, which is: how are the
fertility and mortality of the two main communities in Palestine likely to develop? At
present there is no clear answer to this
question, but consideration of the main
factors may help to suggest some leads.
First, as regards mortality, Table VI summarizes some data, produced by the Department of Statistics, on changes in the expectation of life at birth among Moslems and Jews
since 1931. The Table shows that, although
the Moslems have gained markedly in the
period, they still have a considerable margin
to make up in order to reach the present
levels of Western countries. There is no
reason why they should not do so and, with

greater expenditure on education and public
health, and with a rise in the standard of
living which ought to be brought about by
further industrialization, Western levels
might be reached in a relatively short time.*
The Jews, on the other hand, have already
reached high levels—for males considerably
and for females slightly above the position in
England and Wales in 1937. Though further
improvement is certainly still practicable, it
will probably be more difficult to achieve
than for the Moslems.

So far as Moslem fertility is concerned,
there is little to suggest that Western influences have as yet been of importance. Mills
said that, although the results of his inquiry
showed no statistical evidence of the practice
of contraception, it had been practised in
recent years by urban Moslems.t The
Department of Statistics argues that such

practice is indicated by the lower fertility
of Moslems in large towns, and among
Moslems in the liberal professions and middle
classes.* It would certainly be of great
interest to see the statistics from which these.
inferences have been drawn. Lower fertility
among urban Moslems might, for example,
be due to reductions in the amount of, or to
an increase in the age at, marriage, as well as
to restrictions on marital fertility, and such
a development would be in line with what
seems to have taken place in Japan. The
amount of marriage is also a question of some
importance. In discussing this, the Department of Statistics concluded that the nuptiality rate seemed to be at its maximum and
that no further increase could ‘‘ reasonably
be expected.”’ Yet the marriage and birth
statistics for 1940-3 suggest that the increase in births was greatest among first and
second births (second births particularly
between 1942-3), and for mothers aged under

30 years, and that this might have been due

in part to an increase in marriage. These data
need much closer examination and, in particular, to be checked against the results of
the coming census. But whether or not
family planning is beginning to take hold of
the Moslems, it is clear that during the past
fifteen years European mortality has been
grafted on Oriental fertility. There may very
well be further substantial falls in mortality
before fertility declines in any significant
way.

Fertility among the Jewish population fell
fairly consistently between 1931 and 1941,
though it seems to have risen very markedly
since then. The fall is no doubt partly due to
swamping, by the immigrants, of the more
fertile Oriental Jews. It would be of importance, however, to see whether and, if so,
how far there has been a decline among the
Oriental Jews, as well as among the immigrants themselves. There is no reason to
doubt that birth control is practised by the
immigrants. Indeed, in the collective settlements—which comprise a small part of the
population—the decision by a couple to have
a child or further children is one which is

discussed with the community and in terms
of whether the community can afford to have
additional children at that time.* This kind
of attitude would provide an element of
resilience, helping to raise fertility with
improved economic conditions or prospects.
It may in part account for the abandoning
of previous postponement of births within
marriage which is suggested by the run of
the birth statistics between 1942 and 1943.f
Propaganda for larger families—as part of
the general desire for expansion and selfprotection—may also be having some effect.
But in the absence of any more fundamental
change than has so far occurred, it would
seem probable on balance that the fertility
of Jewish immigrants would follow the
general course of fertility of the countries
from which they derive, though on a higher
level. |

second births and especially for women aged between
30 and 45 years of age. It has been suggested that the
increase in births to these women may be partly
explained by the shortage of contraceptives, which
became very marked after 1942.

The conclusion, which is by no means
novel, is that the fertility of the Moslems is
unlikely to fall rapidly in the near future but
that the fertility of the Jews is likely to

follow the course observed between 1931 and

1941. Even this conclusion is, however, very
tentative, for there is not a sufficient run of
reliable and comprehensive statistics to serve
as.a basis for analysis. It is imperative that
the demographic statistics of Palestine be
improved and expanded so that changes in
the inherent rates of growth of the various
communities can be seen if and when they
occur. This is not just a matter of academic
interest but of direct relevance to the
economy of the country. The demographic
factor is one of the most important factors
in any consideration of the future of Palestine. Every effort should be made to ensure
that the basic census and vital statistics are
appropriate to the importance of the popula
_tion question.* :

population estimates have been checked against the
preliminary results of the impending census, it will be
possible to publish the detailed report of the Department of Statistics, Considerations on the Future Development of the Population of Palestine, which has been the
basis of a large part of this note.
