A POETIC APOLOGY

Sent at the Last Moment sy a Biological Contributor wuo had failed to
send the PROMISED REVIEWS

Stung

By your cutting remarks,
Your sarcasm,

Your scathing, comments,
And what not, |
Burnin?

For the vindication

Of my reputation,

And full

Of righteous indignation,
And also,

In sheer self-defence—
Did

Last night,

Most manfully

But
Pray do not,
Erroneously,

Attribute the cause of this phenomenon

To

A progressive mutation,
Nor see in it

An indication

That the salvation

Of this 3eneration

At least this

Is the only theory

That may be offered
Tentatively,

Pending further evidence

Set my shoulder to the wheel,
Gather moss,
Make a stitch in time—
Of which unwonted,
Unforeseen,
Unforeseeable,

nd—
Nota-bene—
Altogether admirable
Activity,
I herewith enclose,
For your edification,
Delectation,
Mollification
And
Purification,

The End Result

Is assured.

For,

In all probability,

And judging

By the usual interpretations
Of correlations

And valuations

Of equations,

It is merely

A sport.

REFRAIN

And more careful examination
Or cautious investigzation

The problem.
