GREGORY KING AND THE POPULATION OF
ENGLAND AND WALES AT THE. END OF
THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY

By D. V. GLASS

REGORY ‘KING, that “curious
computer,’ as Chalmers called him,

affords one of the most intriguing
puzzles in the history of British demography.
e was described, on his monument in the
Church of St. Benet, Paul’s Wharf, London,
as “‘a skilful herald, a good Accomptant,
Surveyor, and Mathematician, A curious
Penman, And well versed in Political Arithmetick. .. .”* In this last province, political
arithmetic, he achieved marked contemporary recognition, being widely quoted
by Davenant, who depended upon him for
calculations in fields as diverse as population
and coinage. Chalmers, who resuscitated his
work and found both the manuscript of the
Natural and Politicall Observations and
Harley’s comments upon it in the Harleian
collection, referred to him in the most enthusiastic terms : “‘ He who surpassed Petty,
as a political calculator, must be allowed to
have been a master of moral arithmetick.’’+
*Dallaway, J. I nquirtes into the Origin and Progress
of the Science of Heraldry in England, Gloucester and
London, 1793, Appendix II, p. xlviii.
f Chalmers, G. An Estimate of the Comparative

Strength of Great Britain, London, 1804, Appendix,
p. 27. The 1804 edition is referred to throughout this

paper.

This high regard persists to-day. Yet King’s
only publication in the field of political arithmetic was a broadsheet summarizing the
rates and duties payable under the Act: of
6 and 7 William and Mary,.c. 6 (levying
duties on marriages, births, burials, bachelors and childless widowers).* The Natural
and Politicall Observations, upon which King’s
position now largely rests, though forming
the basis of much of Davenant’s work—
evidence that King was, as Chalmers says,

“of a very communicative disposition ”"—
remained in manuscript until first published
by Chalmers in 1802 as an appendix to his
own book, and the only modern reprint is
that edited by Barnett.t

Moreover, the Natural and Politicall Observations themselves, bold and even startling
as they are in their approach to the question
of estimating the size and structure of the
population of England and Wales—with
which the present paper is concerned—raise
more questions than they answer. In fact

they can only be said to answer any of the
major questions with which King deals if not
only the method but also the basic statistics
to which the method is applied are accepted.
It is, however, difficult to do so, for King’s
work is peculiarly lacking in explicitness.
The techniques are not explained, except in
appearance. For example, King arrives at an
estimate of the population of England and
Wales by taking certain figures of the numbers of houses in the different divisions and
multiplying them by a series of factors of
persons per house. The origin of these factors
is not, however, explained, except by stating
that they are “‘according to what we have
observed from the said assessments of marriages, births and burials, in several parts of
the Kingdom.’’* Similarly, save for the
material regarding the town of Lichfield

(Staffordshire), which he says he collected

(or at least that he collected the Observationst), his indications as to source material
are vague. The number of houses in the

Kingdom was that “ as charged, in the books .

of the hearth office, at Lady-Day, 1690.’’f
The remaining material is derived from the
“assessments (on) marriages, births and
burials, parish registers, and other public
accounts.’’§ In fact, for a large part of the
field covered, we cannot check, from King’s
finished product, either the statistics or: the
methods used in arriving at specific results.
As Jones and Judges suggest, “‘ If King is to
be censured, it is for puzzling his readers by
handing in a fair copy from which too many
of the rough notes have been torn.’’|| There is, however, some additional material
which bears very closely upon the methods
and validity of King’s work. Some of this—
dealing with the results for London—has
‘been analyzed and evaluated by Jones and
Judges in the study referred to above. Other
material consists of a bundle of King’s manuscripts in the Public Record Office] and a
bound manuscript volume now in the pos

. though so listed and also referred to by Barnett in his

edition of King, it does not seem as if the papers have
been used in considering the basis and value of King’s
population estimates. This conclusion is, I think, the
more likely in that the bundle contains what appears to
be a working-journal on which King based his Natural
and Politicall Observations. The bundle is noted im the
Lists as “ 1695-1712. Papers of Gregory King,’’ but the
written description on the bundle itself is ‘‘ Mr. Gregory
King. Exercises in politl. Arithmetic and various
miscells. Papers.”

* This volume is evidently another, and very much
larger, working-journal. A study of it and comparison
with the material in the P.R.O. suggests that King was
extremely methodical. Apparently, he made his initial
computations on rough working sheets and then entered
a relatively fair copy in the large journal, which contains about 300 pages, beginning with a list of the
armorial bearings of various persons named ‘‘ King,”
and ending with an index to the cqntents. The contents themselves include, among other material, several
drafts of what ultimately became the Natural and
Politicall Observations, a collection of population data
for various parts of England and Wales, extracted from
the results of the 1695 enumeration (for which, see the
subsequent discussion), and a detailed summary of the
results of the Lichfield survey (referred to below). The
volume itself belonged to Viscount Sydney and passed
to the late John Burns, apparently in 1917. Burns
himself looked through it several times and appears to
have shown it to the late Professor Henry Higgs.
Barnett himself also examined the volume and refers
to a calculation on the influence of scarcity on the price
of corn (op. ci#., p. 6). But no one, as far as I can tell,
ever made use of the demographic material in the
volume, though it contains a great deal of King’s work
on population. The volume now belongs to the London
County Council, being one item in the collection purchased by Lord Southwood from the Burns’ library and
presented to the Council. I am greatly indebted to the
Council for permission to make use of the volume. In
this paper, the larger journal will be referred to as
the Burns journal and the smaller as the P.R.O. journal.

¢ In addition to the manuscript copy of the Observations (No. 1898), and of Harley’s comments (No. 6837),
the Harleian collection contains other valuable maferial
relating to King’s work—e.g. (No. 6832), a list of the
inhabitants of Buckfastleigh, with their ages; returns
(perhaps under the 1694 Act) from Worcester, Stafford
and Gloucester, and some miscellaneous correspondence
of King ; (No. 6839) ‘‘ Observations in the handwriting
of Gregory King ” (August 12th, 1695) on the population of Lichfield ; and (No. 7022) the names of all the
inhabitants of Lichfield. The latter document has been
used by L. M. Marshall (The Rural Population of
Bedfordshive, 1671 to 192r, Aspley Guise, 1934, p. 7)
and inferred to be a return under the 1694 Act. But if,
as seems likely, it is the basis of King’s analysis of
Lichfield and gives the ages of all persons, it is probably
the result of a different survey, of the kind to which
later reference is made.

be supplemented when the British Mueum
documents become available. Nevertheless
it is possible even now to throw light upon
a number of questions, particularly those
concerning King’s factors of the numbers of
persons per house, and the special analysis
for the town of Lichfield, as well as in general
upon King’s material and methods. Before
proceeding to deal with those questioris, however, it is necessary to draw attention to the
general background of population statistics
during the period in which King produced his
estimates. .

Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries the State collected, or ordered the
collection of, statistics which were and still
are, to some extent, used for estimating
population size and trend.* Apart, however,
from the question of degree of incompleteness which applies to all the taxation returns
wused in such estimates, there is the further
complication caused by the need to arrive at
factors with which to transmute the crude
statistics into population estimates: To use
the hearth-tax figures, it is necessary to apply
some average number of persons per hearth,
and a similar device is required if the later
statistics in respect of the window tax are
used. Nor can the crude data of the Bills of
Mortality or the parish registers be used—
again, apart from the question of their incompleteness—unless the population bases
are arrived at. The alternatives—to assume
a stationary population, or constancy in the

birth and death rates—beg the question

which the analysis purports to illuminate.
Different individuals attempted. to construct
such factors, with varying degrees of appropriateness, and the great population controversy of the eighteenth cenfury raged in
part around the factors used.

Yet at the end of the seventeenth century
the State collected information which should
have provided factors, population bases and
vital statistics for the whole country and for
a common period of time. This was under
the Act of 6 and 7 William and Mary c. 6,

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

of 1694, and the subsequent amplifying Acts,
which, for the purpose of providing revenue
for carrying on the war against France,
levied taxes upon burials, births and marriages, and annual dues upon bachelors over
25 years of age and upon childless widowers.*
For the purpose of implementing the 1694
Act, which came into force as from May rst,
1695, certain statistical information was
indispensable. It was necessary to know the
size and structure of the population, in order
to assess the numbers, at the initial point of
time, liable to the various taxes and surtaxes; and it was also necessary to adapt
the existing or devise new machinery for
recording as quickly and accurately as possible the burials, marriages and births

occurring throughout the country.

To collect the former category of statistics
was the duty of the Assessors appointed by
the Commissioners of the Act. These Assessors had to appear before the Commissioners
on a chosen day (on or before April 3oth,
1695, presumably, since the Act came into
force on May Ist), ‘‘ and bring in their certificates in writeing of the names sirnames estates
degrees titles and qualifications of all and
every the persons dwelling or residing within
the limits of those places with which they
shall bee charged dividing them into several

* The taxes are summarized in King’s digest. For
persons without specified property or other qualifications, they were 4s. for burial, 2s. for birth, 2s. 6d. for
marriage, 1s. per year for bachelors and Is. per year for
childless widowers. Persons in receipt of alms were
exempt, but in the case of burial, the parish had to pay
the tax. In the case of the bachelor tax, ‘* Fellows,
students and scholars in the universities ’’ were also
exempt. In addition to these basic rates, there were
also sur-taxes varying with rank and place in the
family. Thus in the case of a duke, the burial fee was
an additional £50, but only an additional {25 for the
younger son of a duke. The lowest rates of sur-tax were
charged to persons “‘of 50L. per Annum, or 600L.

pounds to bee levied as by this Act is
appointed ’”’ (Section XI). That is, a complete enumeration of the population was
envisaged, distinguishing bachelors, widowers
and persons of various ranks and professions,
and this enumeration was to be brought up
to date at the end of each year during the five
years for which the Act was originally imposed (Section XVI).* |

As regards the current vital statistics,
persons in Holy Orders were to keep accurate
accounts in their registers of marriages, and
burials and of all persons “‘ christened or
borne,”’ under penalty of £100 fine (Section
XX). Moreover, the Act placed a consider
able responsibility upon the parents for.

notification of birth, for it provided “‘ that
the Parents of every Child which shall be
borne att any time within the same terme
of Five Years or one of them shall within
Five days after such Birth give notice
to the Collectors or one of them of the Parish
or Place where such Child was borne and of
the Christian Name of such Child and the
day of its Birth And the said Collectors or
one of them shall thereupon give a certificate
in writing under his or their hands unto such
Parent testifying that such notice was given
without fee and reward for the same.’’ The
penalty for failure to comply was 4os., of
which half was to go to the King and the rest
to the informer. Provision was made for the
notification of stillbirths (Section X XI), and
to cover nonconformists, Catholics and
Jews (Section LVII).f . Finally, special
provision was made for recording the vital

statistics of the nobility and gentry. When 
one of them died, a certificate was to be
delivered to the Receiver-General (and transmitted by him to the King’s Heralds),
recording “‘the name sirname title quality

 

* At the end of each year, a copy of the assessments
and collection for each division, parish or place, was to
be made, ‘‘ with such alterations therein as shall be
necessary by reason of the death change of quality or
degree or removal of any person or persons or otherwise .. .’’ (Section XVI). Lodgers and servants were to
be noted in the enumeration, for they were taxed at
their place of residence (Section XXIV).

¢ The clause relating to.stillbirths stated: ‘‘ And in
case any Child shall be borne dead then one of the
Parents thereof shall bring a Certificate under the
hands of Two or more persons testifying the same
unto the said Collectors or one of them... .’’

deceased person with the age time of death
place of burial marriages and issue and the
ages of such issue together with the names

such deceased persons....’”’ The King’s
Heralds were then to ‘‘ number schedule and
digest the same in alphabetical order in
Books to bee provided for that purpose,” and
to “ file upp the Originals in the College of
Arms for publick use . . .”’ (Section L).

In terms of the potential supply of population and vital statistics, this was clearly a
remarkable Act. It provided for the first
complete census (and no other was taken
until 1801), registration of births within five
days* (as compared with 42 days under our
present system), and the creation of a special
register of statistics on differential fertility.t
Such provisions are even more remarkable in
that this Act was originally intended to apply
only for five years—it was subsequently extended for a further five years—and one is
tempted to believe that the elaborate statistical system was envisaged for other than
purely fiscal purposes. Gregory King was
well aware of the statistical significance of the
Act, and made use of some of the resultant
data. It might even have been at his instiga-.
tion that so elaborate a statistical system was
provided for.f . : | |

* This was, in fact, civil registration ; it would not
necessarily mean that parochial registration was
“speeded-up ”’ in the same degree. The “‘ speedingup *’ of parochial registration was provided for in an
amplifying Act.

} For the range of people covered (i.e. persons having
£50 per year or £600 personal estate, or of higher status),
the fertility and social information to be collected for
this register was rather more comprehensive than that
recorded, under the Population (Statistics) Act of 1938,
at the death of married women. Cf. Registvar-General’s
Statistical Review of England and Wales, 1938, Tables,
Part II, p. 108.

{ The original proposal for levying taxes on marriages and burials appears to have come from Richard
Frith. The P.R.O. bundle contains a printed broadsheet entitled A Probable Calculation of the Annual
Income to be Raised by a Tax on Marriages, Burials, and
Legacies, with a note in King’s handwriting on the
back: ‘Fryth’s Project of ye Duty on Marriages
Births and Burials.”” The Calendar of Treasury Papers,
1556-7—-1696, London, 1868, p. 481, item 63, notes a
petition from Richard Frith to the Treasury, ‘‘ showing
that about six years before, he thought of raising money
on burials, marriages and christenings, and imparted it
to the Duke of Shrewsbury, who acquainted the King,
and in this sessions it was accepted by the House of
174

Subsequent legislation, tightening up the
provisions of the 1694 Act, suggests that the
statistical system was by no means perfect.
Under the original Act, for example, births
were notifiable to the Collector, who presumably used the parish register as a partial
check. But births could still escape registration because the parish register covered only
those children who were christened by the
Church of England. Hence, under 7 and 8
William III, c. 35, it was made obligatory
‘upon parents as from June 24th, 1696,
to notify a birth within five days to the
“respective Rector Vicar Curate or Clerk of
the Parish or Place” in which the birth

occurred, whatever the religious faith of the .

parents and whether or not the child was to
be christened. The parish register was by
that means intended to become a complete
record of births and not only of christenings.
Similarly, some deaths escaped the burial
tax because the deceased had died in parishes
in which they were strangers, with no one in
the parish liable for the tax. But as from
June 24th, 1696, such deaths were to be
notified, within ten days after burial, by the
“Deans Parsons Vicars Curates and Their
respective Substitutes,” to the collectors of
the parishes in which the persons had last
lived.*

Even these additional safeguards did not
overcome the defects, especially as regards
the parish registers. The latter were never,
as a whole, fully comprehensive, in spite of
the fact that parsons and other appropriate
ecclesiastical persons were to receive (from
the parents) sixpence for the registration of
each child not christened in their churches,
and were liable to a fine of 40s. (presumably

of the marriage, birth and burial returns (for a few
areas) and an analysis of the enumeration data for
Sevenoaks and for a number of London parishes. The
Burns journal contains a summary of such enumeration
material as King was able to collect. This material will
be referred to later.

in addition to the {100 penalty provided for
in the original Act) for failing to keep a
“true Register ’’ of unchristened children.*
The defects were, in fact, recognized and
accepted by the Act of 4 and 5 Anne, c. 23,
which stated that, where the duties under the
1694 Act had been “really answered and
paid or notified and brought in charge to the
Collector,’ the parsons, vicars, curates or
other persons who had “ neglected to keep a
Register in Writing as aforesaid of all and
every or any Person or Persons so married

‘“‘indempnified against and discharged from ”’
any penalties to which they were liable. This

and Curates and other Ecclesiastical Persons
not being sufficiently apprized of the full
Import of the said Acts of Parliament have
not exactly observed the Directions therein,”’
and ‘“‘ they and their Families remain therefore exposed to Ruin...’’ (Section X).¢ Yet,

* King was fully aware of the defects of the legislation. One of the items in the Burns journal (pp. 120
A/D) is a draft Bill to improve the system as a means of
raising revenue. The proposal was that, from May Ist,
1699, the duties ‘‘ payable upon Marriages Births and
Burials occasionally happening shall be converted into
certain Annual payments....’ In the Observations,
too, King makes an allowance for under-enumeration.
The register of unchristened children was to be kept
separately (7 and 8 William III, c. 35, Section IV).

+ This phrase, ‘‘ full Import,”’ also suggests that the
Acts were designed for more than fiscal purposes, or at
least more than immediate ones. Certainly it would be
difficult to select a tax requiring more complex and
elaborate machinery to levy it. R. E. Chester Waters,
‘A Statutory List of the Inhabitants of Melbourne,
Derbyshire, in 1695; printed from the original M.S.
Assessment, with a Commentary and Explanatory

‘. Notes,” Journal of the Derbyshire Archeological and

Natural History Society, Vol. VII, January 1885,
pp. 1-30, says (though without citing his authorities)
that the 1694 Act created distrust in all sections of the
community, and that ‘‘ the tax was so unpopular that
the local authorities took pains to destroy the machinery
for levying it.”’ Certainly Davenant, who was a friend
of King, was opposed to it. Contrasting the situation at
home with the pronatalist policies of ancient Rome and
seventeenth-century France, he said: ‘“‘ But we in
England have taken another Course, laying a Fine
upon the Marriage-Bed, which seems small to those who
only contemplate the Pomp and Wealth round about
*em, and in their View ; but they who look into all the
different Ranks of Men, are well satisfied that this
Duty on Marriages and Births, is a very grievous
Burthen upon the poorer Sort, whose Numbers compose the Strength and Wealth of any Nation.” (An
Essay upon the Probable Methods of Making a People

1700, p.22.)
GREGORY KING AND POPULATION OF ENGLAND AND WALES

in spite of these acknowledged defects, thestatistics collected were morecomprehensivethan
any provided previously and, indeed, than any
subsequent statistics prior to the establishment of the full mechanism of censuses and
civil registration in the nineteenth century.

The legislation discussed above has long
been known to genealogists and, in general;
to writers on the history of parish registration. Few writers, however, appear to have
appreciated the significance of the Acts as
regards the provision of population statistics.
R. E. Chester Waters drew attention to this.
He wrote: “ . the historian ought to
have learned from the statute book that a
thorough and complete enumeration of the
inhabitants of every parish in England, with
a full and precise statement of their several
names, occupations and qualities, was made
in 1695.... A copy of the assessment was
returned into the Exchequer, and this return
must obviously contain the precise information which the historian required.’’* Since
this comment in 1885, the only study seen
by the present writer which makes use of the
data collected in accordance with 6 and 7
William and Mary, c. 6, has been that by
Jones and Judges, based on the City of
London returns, a copy of which is among the
Guildhall records. One difficulty, of course,
is that so far the returns for the country as
a whole—originally sent to the Exchequer,
according to Waters—have not been located.
Another is that even local copies of returns
for specific areas do not seem to have turned
up, except in the case of Melbourne, in
Derbyshire.t Nor has it so far been possible
to trace any of the spetial returns concerning
the nobility. But in view of the importance
of the returns as a possible contribution to
the economic and social history of the country, it is clearly most desirable to encourage
a search among central and local archives for
the original data.

* Op. cit., pp. 1-2. Although occupations were stated
in the Melbourne returns (except for widows and
widowers), this is not the case with the London returns.

¢ Waters implies that he had come across returns for
other areas. He wrote (p. 5) :.“‘ It is, therefore, not to
be wondered at if these lists of inhabitants were generally destroyed as soon as the Taxation Act expired, and

the few which have been preserved are commonly
found in the hands of laymen.”

175

Whatever the ultimate fate of the returns,
there is no doubt that they were, in fact, the
“assessment on marriages, births and
burials ’’ to which King referred, and which
formed the basis of much of his work. The
King manuscripts abound in references to
the original assessments and in notes on the
results for various parts of the country.
This would seem to make the puzzle even
more puzzling, for King used the statistics in
a limited and very indirect way. Instead of
deriving his estimate of the population of
England and Wales from the sum of the
individual parish and county assessments, he
used those assessments only for the purpose
of providing ratios of persons per house,
obtaining his population by multiplying the
ratios by the numbers of houses, as derived
from the hearth tax returns. Taking the
estimates in their final form, as given in the
Observations, the following: combined table
(Table I) may be drawn up, as covering the
whole population save for certain transients
omitted from the returns—soldiers, sailors,
gipsies, pedlars, and so forth—estimated
separately by King at 80,000 persons.* The
table shows that King, having obtained his
original ratios and thus his first. population
estimate, then found it necessary to allow for
persons omitted from the assessments (other
than transients) and thus ultimately arrived

at a second set of ratios.

In their study of the London returns,
Jones and Judges quite rightly express surprise at this method of successive approximation. Taking the 1695 returns for the City of
London within the Walls (and making an
estimate for the seventeen parishes, the
returns for which they were unable to trace),
they arrived at a total population of 69,581.
King’s first estimate, based on a ratio of 5-4
persons per inhabited house, was 72,900.
After allowing for omissions he chose the
higher figure of 80,190, from which he calculated a final ratio of ‘‘ almost 6 ”’ persons per
inhabited house. The latter ratio is, in fact,
close to that found by Jones and Judges,
namely 6:1 persons, the difference between
the total populations arising from the larger

The explanation put forward by Jones and

that King had made up his mind in advance
to estimate the population on the basis of the
numbers of houses recorded in the hearth tax
returns and that, at the same time, he also
had an estimate derived from the marriage,
birth and burial assessments. Comparing
these two results he may have found that the
ratios of persons per inhabited house were
“ too low for his previously formed estimate ”’
and he thus increased the population by 10

per cent, with a corresponding rise in his

ratios. ‘‘ The result is a higher population for
London in the revised estimate than the
factors available to King seem to justify,”
while at the same time the allowance of Io per
cent per persons omitted “‘ gave him the
average size of ‘ household’ which we know

that he could, and apparently did, extract

Straight out of the marriage duty assessments... .’’+

The error in this explanation is its assumption—and the authors had no basis for a con
* Jones and Judges, op. cit., pp. 53-5 and 58-62.
The Jones and Judges’ figure for inhabited houses is
also in part an estimate, since it includes an allowance
for the seventeen missing parishes.

trary belief—that King had access to the
complete returns, or at least access to those
for London. But ‘the P.R.O. manuscripts
and the Burns journal make it clear that this

was not the case. There is little doubt that

King himself had hoped to make use of the
full material for London, for the P.R.O.
manuscripts contain a table entitled: “ An
Extract of the Number of Houses and People
from ye Assesmt. upon Marriages Births and
Burials a°. Dni. 1695,’’ which lists all the
London parishes and has against them a
number of ruled columns headed: Houses,
People, Quality, Bachelors, Widowers, Yearly
Marriages, Yearly Births, Medium .of 1683
and 1684 Yearly Burials, and Ratio of
Mortality. It is clear that King intended to

enter in these columns the statistics relating

to every parish, and it is equally clear that
he did not succeed in collecting the data
except for a few of them. Table II gives
the numbers of houses, population and
size of household (King’s own calculations)
for those parishes, and gives the comparable
statistics derived by Jones and Judges from
the Guildhall records. Comparison shows
a close approximation between the two sets of
statistics, especially for total population,
except in the cases of St. Michael Bassishaw,
and, particularly, of St. Botolph, Aldersgate,
there being no immediately apparent explanation for these two discrepancies. As far
as can be seen from the available manuscripts, the data listed in Table II comprise
all the London parishes for which King was

able to obtain copies of, or access to, the
original returns.

To arrive at a total population for London,
he had thus of necessity to base his estimate
on a series of ratios of persons per house. In
fact he used different sets of ratios at different times and he was evidently much concerned with the question of which ratios
would be nearest the truth. In most cases he
gives no real statistical reason for using the
particular set of ratios adopted at the time.
But one of the calculations in the Burns
journal suggests that, whatever subsequent
alterations he may have made, he based
himself originally on the information summarized in Table II, for, taking the parishes
listed, he arrives at the following results : *

* Burns journal, p.-58. King gives no explanation for
his exclusion, from the above calculation, of data for
St. Clement, Eastcheap ; St. Gregory by St. Paul’s ; St.
Margaret, New Fish Street; St. Michael Bassishaw ;
St. Peter, Cornhill; and St. Stephen, Coleman Street.
He also refers to the number of houses recorded for St.
Katharine’s Tower, as being incorrect: ‘it has not

above 600 houses, They (the Assessors) having reckoned
‘all ye Divided houses or those in which there is 2 or 3

“ Houses ” “‘ People ’’ ‘‘ People to

The 7 Out Par. in
Middx. (& Surr.) 17,065 75,301 4°413
22,627 100,801 4°455

-These ratios, derived from the statistics
of nineteen of the twenty-five parishes listed
in the P.R.O. manuscripts, are very similar
to the first set of ratios given in Table I, of
the present paper. It would seem, therefore,
that the initial set of ratios used by King for
London were based upon a sample of. the
returns collected in 1695.f
_ For the rest-of England and Wales, King’s

 

Families for so many distinct houses, but those divided
houses are generally but one or 2 in a. Family being

Burns journal appear to date from 1695-6 though it is
‘clear that King must have made further entries as late
as 1700 (see p. 92 of the journal).

+ Although this initial set of ratios is quite straightforward, the various sets of secondary, derived, ratios
are by no means easy to explain.

They are given in a series of summaries in the

overall results are reproduced in Table III.
The precise way in which King made use
of these results in his estimates of the
population of cities, market towns, villages
and hamlets is by no means clear. But the
general scheme of calculation is shown—in a
number of variations—at several points -in
both the P.R.O. and Burns journals. Three
examples are given in Table IV. King might
have been expected to derive the ratios of
persons per house in the various categories
given in the examples from the basic
material of Table III. But if he did this—
and he must certainly have made some use
of the returns in his calculations—the
derivation is not a direct one, and the manuscripts seen so far do not explain what in
fact he did. |

The above discussion suggests the kind of
problem with which King was faced in
making his estimates. He was in the position, so far as the returns on marriages, births
and burials were concerned, of an outside
individual—outside the government service
—at a time when statistics of the kind with
which he wanted to deal were generally
regarded as confidential. He almost certainly
had to content himself with such material as
he might obtain through influential friends.
He knew, at least in part, the limitations of
the basic data* and of his‘ own calculations derived therefrom, acknowledging that

* He made various estimates of the extent of underenumeration in the assessments, those in the Observations being the most generous, namely Io per cent in
London, 2 per cent in the other cities, and 1 per cent
in the villages and hamlets. Nevertheless, Robert
Harley believed the allowances were insufficient and
that, in particular, there was likely to be a greater
degree of omission in the country than in London.
(See Chalmers, op. cit., p. 52.)
180

“What ye true Number of ye People. of
England may be, is not only uncertain but
very difficult to compute ; by reason of the
great neglects and omissions in all the Publick Registers and Assessments.’’* He would
nevertheless argue that the attempt was
worth making. He had his own interests to
serve and he was clearly desirous of obtaining
a position in which his talents would be
better used.f| But at the same time he
genuinely wished to improve the statistical
basis used in estimating the probable revenue
of projected taxes and he also felt that,
especially in the grave circumstances of the
time, it was essential that statesmen should
be properly informed as to the total population and its composition. He was more than
dubious as to the value of Petty’s contribution in this field and wrote: “ Sir William
Petty was lookt upon as the best Computer
of his time, But in all his Computations of the
Numbers of People in England and London,
It is Evident he designed to Represent both
ye one and ye other much greater than they
truly were ; And tho Writing to the Publick
might make it Excusable so to do, Yet least
those Publick accots of His should be too
much Relyed on by those who sit at ye
Helm, to whom a true Account of the
Kingdom is more necessary then to others, I
shall endeavour to give such an Account
thereof as will bear the Touchstone of
Truth.” He could still hope that, with all
its defects, his own estimate would be nearer
the truth than any previously constructed.

In addition to the official:data of the assessments, King used private material which he
must either have collected himself or else
possibly instigated friends and acquaintances
to collect for him. The population returns

Fox, dated December 19th, 1695, he represents his
ability to “‘ give you such an Estimate as may be
depended upon to be the Produce of any Project on foot
for Raysing of money.”

t Ibid, p. 49. The above quotation constitutes the
introduction to an incomplete memorandum entitled

“Of England and London.” In general, King was
sceptical of Petty’s work. On the other hand he paid
a great deal of attention to Graunt’s study (cf.,
particular, P.R.O. journal, pp. 6 and 7,and a document
in the P.R.O. bundle entitled ‘‘ Positions in Grant’s

Note.—In the original list (which gives single years for the first 10 years of life) the age groups are described as

appears that exclusive groups are meant. The results have therefore been expressed in terms of the

customary 5-year groups.

how he obtained the statistics, but two
supplementary documents may help to
throw some light on this. The first is a
printed sheet bound up in the same volume
of Tracts Relating to Customs, Excise and
faxes, which contains King’s only published
work in the field of political arithmetic, the
summary of duties and rates payable under
the Act of 6 and 7 William and Mary, c. 6.
The sheet in question is reproduced in the
present paper and is clearly the schedule for
a proposed or actual sample study, the sample
consisting of parishes with ‘“‘about an
Hundred Families and wherein the Registry
of the Births, Burials, and Marriages hath
been well kept... .’’** For such parishes it
was intended to collect full information on
the age, sex, and marital condition of
every inhabitant as well as the vital statistics
for the years 1676 to 1682. There is no direct
evidence to connect this schedule with King,
but the schedule itself does at least show that
plans for gathering the kind of statistics in
which King was interested were in the air in

King’s period. The second document is in

* The original sheet is in the British Museum,. at

the P.R.O. bundle, and consists of a thirteenpage list and summary (the whole appearing
to be in King’s handwriting) entitled ‘‘ The
Names of the People in Hartfield near
Uxbridge in Com. Middx. with their ages—
Taken ye latter End of Oct. 1699.”’ This list.
goes through every dwelling in Hartfield and
itemizes the inhabitants in each. In the first
two pages the age of almost every person is
recorded, but subsequently thé ages become
sporadic and it seems evident that it must
have been very difficult to ascertain them.
However, the list shows King’s interest in the
subject and suggests a house by house
enumeration.*

This information gives some support for
the belief that the age statistics for Lichfield,
Shustoke and Swepston were based on
genuine enumerations. The Lichfield statistics are obviously those on which King
constructed his special fertility analysis, and
they are summarized in Table V and reproduced (in part) graphically in an accompanying population pyramid. The latter

* King found in Hartfield, according to his summary,
109 inhabited and 8 empty houses, 122 families and

563 persons, and arrived at ratios of 5-16 persons per
inhabited house and 4-61 persons per family.

figure shows the marked concentration of
ages in the second half of each ten-year age
group. It also shows the marked underenumeration of male children. King himself

comments on this and writes, in a marginal 
note: “‘ Now ye Births in Lichfd. in all ye 3
parishes being yearly at a medium 107.
Whereof for these 2861 People [being
Exclusive of ye Close of Lichfield and of some
out Villages which parish to Lichfield but
being without ye Liberties of ye City and
County of Lichfd. are not included in this
Assessment] The Yearly Births may be
about I00 which in 5 years would be 500
whereof a Fifth part dying there should
remain about 400; But whereas there is but
368, there seems to be 32 wanting, Either in
ye Assesmt. itself, or by reason of ye mortality by ye Small Pox which hapned
among ye young children a year or two ago,
which appears more plainly by ye Number
of Children of 1, 2 and 3 years old, Those of
I and 2 years being fewer in Number then
those of 3, whereas they should be more.’’*

* Note that King uses the term ‘‘ Assessment ”’ for
this table. It is possible that the additional information

Leaving aside the question of underenumeration at the early ages, the population
pyramid shows a situation similar to that in
1841, a period of high mortality and high
fertility. It is interesting, therefore, to
estimate the fertility of Lichfield in 1695.
Assuming that King was right and that the
annual average of births was about 100 (and
this figure is more likely to understate than
to overstate the facts), the number of births
per 1,000 women aged 15 to 49 years would
be about 120, as compared with 62 for Lichfield and 56-4 for England and Wales in 1931.
Relating births to married women in the
same age groups would yield a rate of almost
287 per 1,000 women for Lichfield in 1695,
as compared with 106-7 for England and

Wales in 1931 and 124 for Lichfield at the

latter date. Marital fertility in 1931 was
thus less than half of what it appears to have
been in 1695. But, on the other hand, the
1695 rate appears to be very similar to that

 

on ages was collected by the assessors in the course of
their enumeration for the marriage-duty Act. If so, it
was a type of information not required by the Act itself.
GREGORY KING AND POPULATION OF ENGLAND AND WALES

for England and Wales in the 1850’s.*

The object of this paper has been to
inquire into the methods and materials used
by Gregory King in his work on the popula
tion of England and Wales at the end of the.

seventeenth century. The relevance of the
discussion for any new estimates of the
population in 1695 must be left for later consideration. But so far as the first point is
concerned, one fact is abundantly clear:
King was a worthy successor to Graunt.
Hampered by inability to use the full official
data, he showed great imagination in his
handling of what was available. Above all,
his work demonstrates his awareness of the
questions which need to be posed in studying
population trends.f| His approach and

* For England and Wales in 1850-2 the number of

live births per 1,000 married women aged 15-49 years
was over 265. Correction for under-registration in the
period would raise the figure still higher. The Lichfield
data suggest fairly late marriage, but a high marriage
probability. Half of the women aged 25-9 years were
single, while this was so for only one out of sixty in the
age group 45-9 years.

ft Some of these questions are posed by him in the
P.R.O. journal, p. 8, namely: how many marriages
annually ; at what ages persons marry; how many
widows and widowers; at what ages they become such ;

knowledge of his own limitations are perhaps
best summed up in a motto which he intended to use in the introduction to an alternative version of the Observations: ‘‘ Pour
bien savoir les Choses, il en faut savoir le
détail: mais pource qu’il est presque infiny,
nos Connoisances sont toujours superficielles
et Imparfaites.’’* |

how many 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th marriages ;
how many barren marriages; how many teeming
women ; how many die in childbed ; how many die in
labour ; how many marriages produce only one child,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc. Similar awareness is shown in the
Observations, p. 46, where he notes that “ from a consideration of the male and female children in the said
town, and the ages of their parents, at the time, when
such children were respectively conceived, a scheme
may be established, of the powers of generation...”
and one of the draft tables in the P.R.O. journal, p. 21,
was designed to do this by relating conceptions to
married women at individual ages.

* Since writing the above paper, I have been shown a
copy of some comments by the late Professor Henry
Higgs, which appear to refer to the Burns journal.
Professor Higgs wrote that he had always felt sure that
the volume existed but had long searched for it in vain.
He was strongly in favour of publication of at least
part of its contents. It now seems likely that publication of a fairly wide selection of King’s manuscripts
will be possible and I hope to preface the selection with
a more detailed study of the significance of King’s
contributions to demography.
