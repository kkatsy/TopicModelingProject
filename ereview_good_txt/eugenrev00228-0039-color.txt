N THE NATIONAL Health Service nearly 100
per cent of the population are on doctors’
lists. In favourable circumstances this could
provide the opportunity to study records of
families and to extract information in relation to
heritable morbidity. The family doctor in the
National Health Service has thus got an unparalleled opportunity for family studies, provided of course, he has been keeping records and
‘provided he has not a too rapidly changing
practice population.

In our group practice partnership, comprising
about 18,000 patients, we have a good opportunity to study the possibility of collating eugenically relevant information in families. It is
perhaps appropriate here to describe the type of
practice we are working in. There are six principals and a recently appointed assistant. The
district is a semi-industrial re-housing area in
Edinburgh which has gradually extended during
the past twenty years. There is a predominance
of occupations in Registrar General Social Class
iv and v, with a fair number of iii and a few in ii.
The housing consists mainly of tenements although there is a large area of prefabricated
houses, single family houses, along with some
semi-detached villa type of buildings. There are
few owners of their own houses, nearly ninety per
cent being rented from the local authority. The
community is religiously of a mixed nature, with
a slight preponderance of non-catholics. We
conduct our practices in the main from two
specially adapted buildings with nursing and

Eugenic Aspects of Morbidity

secretarial staff available, and close co-operation
with health visitors and the social services.

The National Health Service records by themselves are not very helpful, as there is no ready
way of obtaining the information on a quantitative basis about any one condition, without
going through all the records. If the information
extracted from a National Health Service
Practice is to be of any use, it would have to be
based on a sufficiently large number of patients.
To obtain data on this scale from the existing
records would require repeated “‘going through”’
the National Health Service records which is a
practical impossibility.

In 1958 we began to plan an investigation to
explore the possibilities of family doctor records
in the National Health Service.

A pilot survey of the patients with letter ‘“‘A’’
showed that we would have a monumental task
if we decided to extract all the information
already recorded. What was required was a
recording system of coded information allowing
ready access to relevant information for the
conduct of further, and particularly long term
studies. Very early on we realized that in this
group practice it would be impossible to code
and index all morbidity met with in our daily
work. We decided to limit ourselves to the
clinical conditions which produce a pathology
with permanent changes, viz. mainly all chronic
conditions, congenital abnormalities. Another
objective was to demonstrate that such a system
of recording, coding and indexing could be used

226

within the framework of a general practice, with
ordinary secretarial help, after the initial general
indexing had been completed.

Method and Objective

After several trial systems, we adopted a
visible edge type of indexing system. This was
after the encouraging experience of Drs. P.
Walford and Eimerl. Special coding sheets were
designed and printed to fit loose leaved stiff
covered binders. Each binder holds approximately 350, 34 = 5? in. cards. These cards were
designed to serve the following needs:

1 Entire families recorded on one sheet to allow
rapid identification of individuals and their
family composition.

2 To record selected morbidity in individual
families.

3 To provide continuous and up to date records of
age and sex of each patient.

4 To permit rapid statistical summaries of population and morbidity of practice.

The front lower visible edge of these cards
shows the family name and address. The reverse
upper visible edge shows the date of birth for
each member of the family with space to insert
christian name and relationships along with date
of removal from list and with space for symbols
for death, enlistment, removal, emigration or
change of doctor. The front of the card is
divided into ten corresponding spaces and is
identically numbered for use for entering coded
clinical facts on each member of the family.
Families of three generations or more are flagged
at one of the visible corners: “‘G.”’

A special (research) secretary was engaged.
She was familiar with all the partners’ handwriting and also with the structure and organization of the practice. We were fortunate in finding
such a person already trained in accurate secretarial work and able to decipher the National
Health Service records. After preliminary pilot
runs, this secretary was able to code all the information contained on patients’ records.

In August 1959 the first and tedious phase of
the work began. This consisted of completing the
basic age/sex data and known family relationships. This phase—which embraced basic data
covering the lists of six doctors—provided the
framework for the future studies and took fourteen months to complete. An additional delay of

226

  

three months was occasioned by the Printers’ ©
strike in 1959.

Coding and transcribing the morbidity details
on to the family record sheets has proved much ~
more time consuming than was at first anticipated. It is only now that we are approaching the
end of this formidable task. A system of signals
had to be devised so that when the patient appeared during the consulting hour, we could
complete missing details. We sorely tried the
patience of the Edinburgh Executive Council in
asking them for missing dates of births, changes
of name, etc. We are extremely grateful for their
unfailing helpfulness and forbearance.

The routine clerical work of keeping up to date
the already established and completed part of
our family recording system was carried out
simultaneously with the progressive building up
of the new family index. We devised a system
whereby the normal secretarial staff of the
practice have kept up-to-date, in the family
record books, all the changes of address, the
entry and leaving of patients into the practice —
(about fifteen per cent of the total practice —
population come and go throughout a year).
Pari passu any new diagnoses on the agreed list —
of codable illnesses was entered. A system was —
introduced by which all such information was
automatically brought to the secretarial attention.

In choosing only those conditions with permanent pathological changes we were influenced —
by the fact that the vast majority of these conditions would sooner or later have confirmatory —
hospital reports or specialists’ opinions and/or —
laboratory investigation reports. Thus we would
obtain check material which could be readily —
coded by secretaries. The coding of the selected —

clinical material was based on the International —

Classification of Disease. The index volume of —
the Internation Classification of Disease proved ©
readily understandable to our non-medical —
secretariat. Thus all letters concerning clinical —
diagnoses of patients are coded every morning
by the time the partners arrive to read their
letters.

Special checks on the accuracy of the coding of —
morbidity are being carried out and will be —
repeated from time to time. |

The above descriptive notes are sufficient to
outline the enormous amount of work which had

to be done to get those 20,000 patients coded
over the past year and a half. (20,000 is a near
enough estimate when we remember patients who
have left the practice and those who have repi.ced them during 1959/60). However, we are
now reaching the second stage of our project
when we will be able to look at certain diseases
in the context of the families. Before we can draw
valid statistical conclusions from these figures
which are beginning to emerge from our recording system, we still have to follow up a large
mumber of queries as regards relationships.

‘These gaps we hope to fill:

a. Through the partners’ intimate knowledge of a

good many families.

b. With the help of the health visitors.

_¢. By personal follow-up visits either by our
special (research) secretary or own visits when
the time is available.

Thus it may well be another six to nine months
before we are in a position to make valid obseryations on the family pattern of certain diseases.
It is however, tempting to take a few quick
glimpses at some of the results which are likely to
come out of this recording system. These preliminary notes and discussions refer to the
completed two-thirds of the clinical material
which has been indexed. However, in view of the

 

possible encouragement to others who might be
starting to look into family case histories in
general practice, we thought it worthwhile to
write this short progress report.

Table 1 shows the age/sex distribution of
diabetics, epileptics and hypertensives under
treatment. The figures in brackets indicate the
number of patients with any one of the three
conditions having relations within some other
separately recorded family in the practice. These
figures are given solely as an indication of the
extent of the kinship in this practice. The kinship
totals in Table 1 are themselves an underestimate
as we have not yet investigated all relationships
but only recorded relationships apparent to the
research secretary.

It is of interest to note how easily the extraction of the figures was accomplished. The figures
shown in Table 1 were obtained within three
hours from the record books.

The majority of kinship relations in this
practice group are of the parent-child and sib
type with a substantial but as yet unascertained
number of three generation families. One third
of the families with epileptic or diabetic members
have other related families also within the
practice, whilst in hypertensive cases a quarter of

such family relationship has so far been demonstrated.

Summary

Twenty months of work has achieved nearly
the completion of coding and indexing all civil
data for a group practice of six principals. Only
one full-time secretarial help was required to
build up the basic family recording sheet, whilst
the ordinary secretary-receptionists employed in

228

the partnership were quite able to record anc
code the clinical material that arose from th
day to day work of the partners. g

We have now enough experience to say that al
of the objectives outlined above have beet
realized. Any limitations of the results so far are
due to failure to record morbidity in the pa After the present basic indexing has been com
pleted we know that currently occurring mi
bidity can be systematically recorded without
extra secretarial staff or hours of work. |
