an easy. introduction to.a very important
subject. The author has a shrewd sense of
the ordinary reader’s difficulties. His ex‘position is orderly and based throughout on
the assumption that the reader has no
previous knowledge of genetics; and for
those whose ignorance also extends to
cytology there is an appendix in which the
elements of this subject are set out in
sufficient detail. The matters dealt with
include Mendelian heredity, the genetics of
sex, the action of genes, polymorphism (with
particular reference to the taste test and the
inheritance of blood groups), and methods of
study in human genetics. The work is concerned in particular with the transmission of
hereditary diseases and with the interaction
of genetic factors with their environment,
including that part of it which is provided by
other genetic factors. The sections on
eugenics and on problems of race are particularly to be commended. For these alone the
work deserves a place on every eugenist’s
bookshelves. _

Race, Reason and Rubbish,* by Professor
Gunnar Dahlberg, is a more highly polemical
but, within the narrower limits of its subjectmatter, a not less valuable work. In the

SCIENTIFIC

sections on genetic principles the author’s
approach is a little more elementary than
Mr. Ford’s ; on the other hand he discusses
problems of race and racism in somewhat
greater detail and in more specific reference
to what, in a sub-title, are described as “ the
biological credentials of the Nazi creed.” The
fact that the work has been translated from
the Swedish original by Professor Lancelot
Hogben is both a testimony to its scientific
value and a sufficient clue to its general
outlook.

Mr. Kenneth Walker has followed his
excellent Pelican Book on the Physiology of
Sex by another on the wider theme of Human
Physiology. It is, as one would expect,
eminently readable, though the author's
characteristic signature is not so plainly
evident between the lines as it is in most of
his works. Mr. Walker is concerned with
material facts and spiritual values, but
though he respects the former he is: plainly
more at home with the latter. The work
would have been better with an index, but
perhaps that iS asking too much for one ’S
ninepence.

the moment economic conditions are favouring a high level of young marriages ; delayed
marriages and delayed births from the years
of the great depression are also contributing
their share ; and we have been “‘ borrowing ”’
marriages and probably births from the
future. It is, as Kuczynski remarks, ‘‘ absurd
to assume that those who now marry at 24
would adopt the views and habits of another
social group only as a consequence of marrying earlier.”’* In other words, earlier marriage
and the earlier birth of one child does not
mean that families will be larger.

Perhaps, however, ‘‘ borrowing ”’ is not the
right word, for we may not intend to pay
back. Thus, in a period of unprecedented
economic prosperity we have, while temporarily enjoying an abnormally large age
group 20-40, been recouping from the past
and “‘ stealing,’ shall we say, from the future.
To this favourable situation we have added
an entirely novel incentive for women, to have
at least one pregnancy. Future students of
demographic history may well ask why, in
this favourable situation, with the danger of
national defeat removed, the cessation of
massed air attacks, and the promise of a new

and better world within realization, the rise’
in the birth rate has not been higher than
recorded to date. It is indeed more than
probable that the rise will continue for some
time, perhaps reaching 20 per 1,000. But let
us remember the oscillations in the past and
bear in mind that what is happening to-day
in Britain is also happening in other parts of
the world. In the U.S.A., in most parts of
the Dominions, and even in Denmark,
Holland, Sweden, Switzerland and Czechoslovakia the crude birth rate rose in I9g4I
and again in 1942. Whereas the rise in 1942
for England and Wales (over the average
for 1936-8) was 6 per cent, the corresponding
increases in Sweden, Switzerland and Denmark amounted to 23 per cent, 21 per
cent and 14 per cent respectively.

This turn in the birth-rate trend has been
unexpected because of the known effects of
previous wars on fertility. In 1939 it seemed:
as though the war would cause the birth rate
for England and Wales to decline to an
abnormally low level. Up to the end of 1941
these fears were at least partially justified.
Now the upswing has come. Does it herald a
permanent change? Should we not rather
say, after taking account of the remarkable
combination of favourable influences, that the
tide of reproduction, which has been receding
for over sixty years, has not yet turned ?

least a generation to mature.

The process of vitalization which took
place at Peckham, not through propaganda,
not through the treatment of sickness, not
through the prevention of disease, but by
the promotion of health in every one of its
meanings, was very largely due to this pro
vision of a new kind of environment. This.
was one experiment, there may be others.
It is by studying such experiments, where
new social factors have been introduced and
certain results have been achieved, that we
can begin to look for the solution of the
problem which is exercising all the seriousminded people who believe that the future of.
