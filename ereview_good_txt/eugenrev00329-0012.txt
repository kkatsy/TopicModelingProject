GENIUS AS A BIOLOGICAL
PROBLEM."

By Dr. Jox, A. Msgéex,

Why does the great genius disappear in the next generation?
The answer is: because every child has two parents. Every child has
two parents belonging to two families, two stocks, and we do not
inherit the qualities of our parents, but those of the stock. When
father and son very often resemble each other, it is because the son
belongs to the same stock, about 50% to the stock of the father, and
50% to another stock with which the father—biologically——has no
contact whatever; that is to say, in the society of to-day, where
marriage within the same stock is an exception. When the royal
dynasties of Peru and the royal dynasties of Egypt at certain periods
married within their own stocks—brother and sister marriages—we
read that great intelligence or genius was kept up through many generations. It seemed as if great ability only ceased to appear, when the
brother had no sister to marry. We do not recommend brother and

sister marriages, but we do recommend the genius to marry into good
stock. When Goethe and Napoleon took so little care of the fundamental laws governing the building up of the next generation, that
they chose a woman like Christiane, or a stock like that of Marie
Louise, we are not allowed to expect a second Goethe or a second Napoleon
inthe next generation ; we are not allowed to be surprised that Goethe’s
son August, and his two grand-sons Wolfgang and Wilhelm led an
unhappy life, ‘‘im Schatten der Titanen.’’

_As stated above, every child has two parents belonging to two
stocks, and we do not reckon only with the one and completely neglect
the other unpunished.

But when the genius Johann Sebastian Bach married within his
own stock (second cousin) and later into another congenial stock, we
find that the great ability does not disappear.

In the Wedgewood-Darwin-Galton family the cousin marriages
are frequent—-the number of great talents too. But, what seems to
be of much more importance, is the fact that we hardly find one
member in this family who is not above average as regards mental
ability and character.

If we could succeed in isolating a single psychic quality from the
great complex of qualities tepresented by homo sapiens, no matter what
might be the significance of the quality itself for the individual, for the
race and for the community, and could establish exactly and verify its
occurrence in the different members of families throughout several
generations, the results of such investigations might have far-reaching
consequences for the understanding of the heredito-psychological
problems in particular and the elucidation of the laws of heredity in
general.!

Although the repeated occurrence of eminent talents in
families points to the conditioned inheritance of musical ability, it
gives but little information as to the conditions of heredity and the
manner of inheritance. In order to get an insight into the problems of
inheritance it is necessary to consider also the mean variations of
musical ability.

Musical ability is the product of several qualities. Its nature
and degree is different in every individual. If we regard musical
ability as a unit, then the individual divergences are mainly of a
quantitative nature. These quantitative divergences in musical
ability form within a sufficiently large group of any population a continuous series of variations from the lowest to the highest degree of
musical endowment. There exists no sharply defined dividing line
between ‘‘musical’’ and ‘‘unmusical.’’ Therefore these terms are
just as inapplicable as a psychological standard-measure in genealogical and statistical investigations as the terms ‘‘tall’’ and ‘‘short’’
would be in an anthropological research on stature.

It strikes one at once that there exist families so uniform in their
musical powers, that it seems as if one generation is not only a recapitulation of the preceeding one, but even that a certain inequality,
which might have been discernible in the ancestors, has disappeared

and given place to a homogeneous blend.
In fig. 6 we see how a ‘‘musical’’ strain meets with an ‘‘un

From these genealogical records it has been possible to establish
that the hereditary aptitudes mean much more than external influences.
Genealogical records are, however, not sufficient to give a real insight
into the manner of inheritance. This has to be obtained through
geneo-statistical investigation, where the investigations of different
families are summed up and treated by statistical methods.

In the following pages some results of such geneo-statistical investigations are shown. 'The musical abilities of the members of 114
families have been recorded on the basis of measurements, each individual being graded from 0 to 10.

In order to give a clear illustration of the relation of the abilities
of the children to those of the parents, the individuals have been classified in three classes: ‘‘Superior’’ (8, 9, & 10), )‘‘Musical’’ (8, 4, 5,
6 & 7) and ‘‘Poor’’ (0,1, & 2). According to this classification 6
groups of marriage-types can be established, namely: SxS,S x M,
(or Mx S), Sx P (or Px S), Mx M, Mx P (or P x M) and Px P.

The results of these investigations show: The higher the average
talent of the parents, the higher is the average talent of the children.
In our material ‘‘very talented’’ parents (8, 9, & 10) have no ‘‘untalented’’ children (0, 1 & 2), and ‘‘untalented’’ parents no ‘‘very
talented’’ children.

to explain the endowment of the children. We all know families

where no correlation seems to exist between the mental or physical
traits of parents and offspring, and we often meet with results that a
widely divergent from those obtained from geneo-statistical investigations. Thus we find in some families that the average for the children
is very much higher than for the parents, while in other families we
can observe an excessive decline of the children’s average from that
of the parents.

Fig. 9 gives a striking illustration to the fact that we do not
inherit from our parents.

Here we see in the first place that the grand-parents are both
equally or almost equally talented. Also their collaterals (4 and 5).
The four children of the F1 generation show uniform talent, each with
the figure 5. Let us first take the two in the middle: the son marries
a 2, the daughter actually a 0, as regards musical talent. The result
in the F2 generation lies at about the average for the parents, the one
couple has a child with index 3, the other couple two children with
2and 4. But it will now be interesting to note the fate of the musical
endowment of the eldest and the youngest children of the F1 generation :
Both of them married equally talented men. Nevertheless, the four
children of the younger sister have an index-average of only 3.75
whilst the eldest sister’s 7 children have an average of 7.7 with one of
10 (musical optimum), two 9 and one 8. The explanation lies in the
average-indices of the collaterals of the equally talented husbands:
on the one side 7, on the other only 8. The eldest sister of the F'
generation married into an equally talented stock, an equal heritage, or
even somewhat above, the youngest married an equally talented individual
with materially inferior hereditary endowments. Or in other words:
the crossing in the case of the elder sister was congenial as regards
musical endowment, in case of the younger sister it was not so,
although the individual talents of the two husbands were equal. The
younger sister sinned against the old proverb from Western Norway :
*“You must not marry a maid who is the only fine maid of her breed.’’

It is in other words the quality of the stocks rather than the quality
of the parents, which determines the abilities of the children.

In the III generation in fig. 10 we find 7 brothers and sisters all
being extraordinarily talented. The father himself and his family
were all ‘‘musical’’ though not much above average. The mother,
however, was a well known European concert-player, and it seemed
very natural to see herein the explanation of the appearance of the
7 eminent musicians. But according to the results mentioned above
we do not inherit from the individual, but from the whole ‘stock,
and we therefore expect to find that the family of the mother
is constituted of highly gifted, or at least very musical members. To
our surprise we found that all the members of the mother’s family were
‘‘unmusical’’ i.e., much beneath average. According to our experiences this is an impossibility. For a long time this extraordinary
case was a mysterious problem, until one day the enigmatic veil was
lifted by a member of the family with the words: ‘‘I do not see why
you should not know what so many relatives and friends are acquainted

As a result of our investigations we have found two categories for
the explanation of the musical endowment of the offspring:

1. Children whose abilities can be explained by the abilities of
the parents alone.
2. Children whose abilities can not be explained by the abilities
of the parents, but by the abilities of the ‘‘collaterals.’’
254 EUGENICS REVIEW.

But we find also a third category in our genealogical investigations,
where neither the parents nor the collaterals appear to explain the
endowment of a child. Investigations on the families of persons"of
eminent talent or of genius exemplify this observation.

In order to get an insight into this problem, it is not enough to.
regard musical ability as a unit quality.

Musical ability is a product of several separate qualities. The
nature and degree of musical ability is determined by the more or less.
pronounced character of these separate qualities. In order to make
clear the manner of inheritance of musical ability, it is necessary to.
examine the separate components, their relations and their significance,
both psychologically and biologically.

An analysis of musical ability in its separate components or basic
qualities presents, as may be understood, great difficulties. There
are, it is true, some qualities, above all the most elementary qualities
of sense of tone, which we with approximate certainty may regard as.
basic qualities. But the further we penetrate into the more purely
musical field, the more difficult it becomes to distinguish the different
qualities from each other, and to define them as basic qualities. Our
first task is therefore to isolate the separate capacities, which we can
distinguish in the perception, understanding and application of
musical tone-pictures, and to examine them as regards their heredity,
without considering whether in the individual case we have to do with
a basic quality or not.

Firstly therefore we have measured the following acoustic-musical
and musical capacities by means of psychotechnical methods! :

1. Discrimination of pitch. 2. Discrimination of intensity.
8. Discrimination of time. 4. Discrimination of tone-interval.’ 5.
Determination of pitch. 6. Tonal memory. 7. Determination of
interval. 8. Determination of tone-purity. 9. Tune-memory.
10. Discrimination of key (Major and minor). 11. Discrimination of consonance and dissonance. 12. Analysis of tone-complexes.
18. Discrimination of harmonies. 14. Musical imagination. 15.
Rhythmic memory. 16. Discrimination of species of time. 17. Reproduction of tunes. 18. Singing of a ‘‘second’’ part. 19. Determination of absolute pitch (qualitative). 20. Emotional musical
reaction .

The methods for measuring these different musical abilities, and
the recent results of our investigations on analysis of hereditary musical
faculty will be brought out in another article.

It is not impossible, that these investigations will throw some new
light upon very intimate reciprocity between the biological and the
psychological side of music and upon the origin of the abilities and
talents in general.

In order to explain the biological appearance of eminent
ability, it is not sufficient to work with average values and quantitative investigations. Even if the basic qualities, which constitute

(1) Cf. C. E. Seashore: The Psychology of Musical Talent, Boston, I919.

Fr. Mjéen: Die Bedevtung der Tonhéienunterschiedsempfindlichkeit fiir die:
Musikalit&ét und ib: Verhalten bei der Vererbung. Diss. 19238.
GENIUS AS A BIOLOGICAL PROBLEM. 255

eminent ability are of a higher quantitative value than in other individuals, nevertheless these quantitative divergences in basic qualities
are not sufficient to explain the divergences in the psychological ability
as a whole. Further investigations made on cases of eminent musical
talents or even genius, show that the latter in regard to basic qualities,
very often are much below the optimum for these qualities.

The explanation must lie in the fact that the nature of a quality
will change under the influence of other qualities. For instance, the
yellow of a book will not change very much if we place the book on a
blue carpet. We perceive the two qualities separately as yellow and
blue, according to the quantitative degree of the two components. But
if we miz the two qualities blue and yellow on a painters palette, we at
once get quite a new quality—green—and, what is of great importance,
this new quality is to a certain degree independent of the quantity of
the two components.

Such a theoretical scheme might illustrate how the same quality
f.i, music—combined with other qualities—f.i. imagination or voice—
not only willchange its phenotypical appearance, but even that the combined traits (illustrated by such a colour-mixture), will reach a degree
of development, which in relation to the possibilities for development
of each of the single traits isolated, might become unduly high.

As Fig. 11 shows, it is the combination of the traits available more
than the quantitative degree of the single quality, which determines
the genesis of eminent ability.

A peasant in Valdres (fig. 11, Gen. I, 1.) known in the parish for
his many ideas and plans, and for his restless temperament. He was
successful in nothing. His son (Gen. II. 8) went to Oslo, where he
intended to become an artist and where he tried ‘‘everything possible.’’
He ruined himself financially, and also his relatives, with his fantastic
impossible projects. Finally he became a decorative painter. His
first wife was of a musical family, which, however, had not succeeded
in gaining distinction (want of imagination?). From this marriage,
however, where a restless fantasy is coupled with solid musical faculty,
three highly gifted children sprang, one of them being the most talented
composer in the North, Rikard Nordraak, who died at the age of 24.
Fortunately for us biologists, the father married for the second time an
‘‘unmusical’’ lady of ‘‘unmusical’’ family. Of their four children
only one was above average. And the two groups from the two marriages demonstrate most convincingly the importance of the choice of
the partner. From the same source of imagination (Nordraak) there
arose through conjunction with intelligence and energy (Peder Bjérnson)
the poetic genius Bjérnstjerne Bjérnson. (Fig. 11—III, 1.)

SUMMARY.

The nature and degree of musical ability is different in each
individual according to the more or less pronounced character of the
different component faculties. The divergences in musical ability
form within a sufficiently large group of the population a continuous
series of variations from the lowest to the highest grade of musical
endowment.

The accumulative occurrence of musical talent in families speaks
for the heredity of the factors determining musical ability, but gives
little information as to the conditions of heredity and the manner of
inheritance.

An insight into the conditions of heredity can only be obtained by
subjective and objective measurements of the family members in two
or three generations and examining the results as regards the single

family as well as the whole geneo-statistical material.

Our first geneo-statistical result shows that the higher the average
talent of the parents, the higher is the average talent of the children.

By considering the distribution of talents within the single family
we often meet with results that are widely divergent from those obtained from geneo-statistical investigations. We find for instance that
the endowment of the parents is not always sufficient to explain the
endowment of the children. Thus we find in some families that the
average for the children stands much higher than for the parents,
whilst in other families we can observe an excessive decline of the
children’s average from that of the parents, An explanation of this
is found in considering the collaterals, |

It is the quality of the stocks more than the quality of the
parents which determines the ability of the children.
