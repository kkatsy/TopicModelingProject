Estimates of the Future Growth
of World Population

SOME ALTERNATIVES

THE MAIN FEATURES of the current rapid
growth of world population are so well known
that they hardly constitute a suitable subject for
a page normally devoted to some of the less well
appreciated facts of demography, while the
prospects for the future are rather too indefinite
to be classed as “‘facts”’. There are, however, two
particular reasons for attention to this qu stion
at the present time. First, it is especially topical
because of the World Population Conference
that has just been held in Belgrade. Secondly,
and more specifically, one of the Russian papers
to that Conference, offered “‘as a contribution
to the problem” has presented a projection
alternative to and radically different in character
from the work of the United Nations Population
Commission. Whereas the United Nations expect
that the present total of 3,000 million will rise
by the year A.D. 2000 to within the range
5,000—7,000 million, Professor Boyarsky, on a
rougher calculation, has put the spread of
possibilities thirty-five years hence as being only
4,000-—5,000 million.

This enormous difference of outlook, with its
important implications for policy, arises from
two independent calculations of a widely disparate nature, in which there is not an equal
amount of attention to detail. The work of the
United Nations was performed in considerable
complexity for each subregion by an expert staff
of some size (and described in a volume of some
300 pages). Professor Boyarsky’s assessment was
obtained by rough and ready methods on two
or three sheets of calculations that are quoted
in full in his paper (which has been wholly translated into English). This disparity is not, however,
a good reason for dismissing the comparison
out of hand, for assumptions are at least as
significant as methods in this form of exercise,
and a totally independent view can at least be
stimulating and productive of fresh thoughts.

As the Professor very reasonably indicates, the
history of projections is one of repeated failure,
and any figures for more than twenty years ahead
can only be guesswork.

One example of the independence of thought
shown by Professor Boyarsky is his classification
of world regions by political commitment, viz.
into communist, capitalist and unaligned countries, rather than the alphabetical and geographical arrangement adopted by the United Nations.
The communist countries appear at the top of
his list and of these Russia is quoted the first
of all. This form of division seems quite logical,
however, having regard to the important effect
that official national policy is likely to have on
fertility, mortality and migration in the coming
decades, and national policies within each group
may have their similarities. But the difference in
presentation makes it difficult to quote fully
comparable figures in as much detail as would
seem desirable. The best that can be achieved
within a short space is set out in Table 1
in round figures—and in an order based
broadly on a reading from top left to bottom
right of a typical British atlas.

It will be noted that the Russian assessments
are not always below those of the United Nations.
Professor Boyarsky’s belief is, indeed, that the
populations of both Eastern and Western Europe
will rise faster than has been projected in New
York. For Russia, however, the Professor’s
figures are slightly the lower of the two alternatives. The contribution of these differences to
the disparity in world totals is only marginal.
Curiously enough, the two authorities differ
hardly at all over China, the country about whose
vital statistics there might well have been the
greatest independence of view. North America
and Oceania can also be left largely out of account
as they are not among the more significant elements in the difference of nearly 1,500 millions

between the two medium projections for the
year 2000. This arises mainly from Latin
America (300 million), Africa (400 million),
India (200 million) and the Rest of Asia (500
million), i.e. from the politically non-committed
and economically under-developed part of the
world. For these areas the difference of view
between the two authorities is remarkable. The
United Nations’ experts expect to see a trebling
of population in Latin America and Africa, and
more than a doubling in India and the Rest of
Asia, in the period 1960-2000, whereas the
Professor expects a good deal less than doubling
in all these areas.

Technically speaking Professor Boyarsky’s
approach is crude. He first assumes the numbers
of births per annum to be constant over a considerable past and future period, and on this
basis adjusts the population size for improving
longevity by the use of ratios of expectations of
life at birth at various times. Then he rates up
the result by a percentage, varying from 0 to 20
according to region, on general grounds after
discussing the probable fertility trends. This
method does not pay sufficient regard to the
fact that over many areas the annual numbers
of births have not remained constant but are
increasing rapidly. The Professor argues from
Western European experience, in which rising
populations have been combined with rapidly
falling fertility. This is of doubtful validity for
Africa, Asia and Latin America. Wherever
sound data are available in these continents this
is seen to be so, for instance in the following illustrative examples of data, said to be

ER—P

reasonably complete, taken from the United
Natigns Demographic Year Book for 1963:

TABLE 2
TOTAL NUMBER OF BIRTHS IN
1954 1962

Mauritius 22,000 26,000
South Africa (coloured

population) 57,000 76,000
Guatemala 163,000 191,000
Chile 221,000 275,000
Taiwan 384,000 423,000

It is true that in many areas the trend of the
numbers of births is unknown, and that where
it is known the period of years covered by the
information is short; yet it is logical to expect
that as total population has increased so also
have the annual numbers of births; otherwise,
a corresponding fall in fertility would have
occurred, which in the light of our general knowledge seems very unlikely indeed.

As the United Nations projections have been
made in great detail it is possible to form some
idea of the extent of the fall in fertility that would
be necessary for the projections of Professor
Boyarsky to be realized in practice. Thus for
India, the United Nations’ alternative projected
populations for the year 2000 are:

millions
Fertility constant at present levels 1,230
Fertility declining from 1970 to one-half its
present level 980
Fertility declining from 1965 to one-half its
present level 910
Fertility declining from 1960 to one-half its
present level 840

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

From this it may be inferred that, on Professor
Boyarsky’s approach, leading to a total of only
690 million, the average level of fertility assumed
for the last four decades of the present century
must be something like two-thirds of its amount
in 1960; the level of fertility in the year 2000
would be well below one-half of its present value.

Such an assumption is not, however, made
explicit in his paper, and there seems little hope
that such a rapid evolution of thought in relation
to family size could come about in India. The
implications for other parts of Asia and for
Africa and Central and South America are
similar.
