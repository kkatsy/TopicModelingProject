Demographic Rivalry Between
U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.

SOME

thing, but it is perhaps unprecedented for a

dispute to arise as to which of two countries
has the higher mortality or fertility. Yet this is
what has been happening recently. Myers, the
Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration in Washington, stated publicly in 1959 that
mortality in the U.S.S.R. in recent years had
been significantly higher than in the U.S., and
conversely that Russian fertility had been lower.
Professor Merkov, of the Institute of Health
Protection and History of Medicine in Moscow,
retorted that “‘correctly conducted demographic
analysis serves to confirm that . . . birth and
fertility rates are higher in U.S.S.R., and mortality lower, than in the U.S.A.” Professor
Merkov went on to imply that, as the United
States had the most favourable experience, in
these respects, of any country in the capitalist
world, this showed that prosperity must be
higher in the U.S.S.R. than in the West generally.

Myers has now supplied a new analysis in
which he sets out the death rates in Russia in the
year 1958 in quinary age groups, as quoted by
Pravda, alongside the corresponding figures for
America.* This comparison shows that, on the
available figures, Russian mortality is the higher
of the two at all ages up to forty-five, and the
lower of the two after age fifty.

Once we are aware of the extent and direction
of mortality differences at various age-points, it
becomes of only limited significance to attempt
to express the whole in a single average index
ratio. If one does so, however, the result will
depend on the method of weighting used. Myers
now shows that if the Russian population is used

as the weighting system, then Russian mortality
appears to be 3 per cent higher overall, but if
the United States population is adopted for this
purpose then American mortality appears to be
3 per cent higher overall. Neither of these average disparities is particularly meaningful. It
would be more useful if valid and comparable
analyses by cause of death could be made, as
these might throw some light on the real medical
and social differences between the two countries
and how mortality rates could be further reduced
in each one.

In regard to fertility it is not possible to enter
into so much statistical detail because of the
absence of Russian data, and analysis is more
complicated because of the element of marital
status. Myers reaffirms that, although the crude
birth rates in the two countries are closely
similar, an intrinsically higher fertility in the
U.S.A. is offset by an older age-distribution.
Until more details are available, this must remain
the most likely account of the situation.
