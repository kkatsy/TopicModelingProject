BRUGENICS IN AUSTRIA*

1. VITAL STATISTICS

HE Federal State of Austria—according to the latest census, taken on
March 22nd, 1934—has a population
of 6,750,000 persons. Of that number about
2,000,000 live in Vienna and its immediate
surroundings. The main figures about the
movement of population during the last sixty
years are summarized in the following table :

It is interesting to study the changes in
the birth-rate in the different parts of the
country. This, as may be seen in the following table, was in the period 1871-5 higher in
Vienna than in the rest of the country, while
to-day the opposite is the case.

The birth-rate of Vienna is extremely low
—much lower, for instance, than in London
or Paris. Only in Berlin is the rate equally
low. In Berlin, however, the differential
birth-rate has nearly disappeared, while in
Vienna it still exists, the birth-rate being
much higher in the proletarian parts of the

It must be noted that these are crude rates.
The age composition of the various districts
may show great differences. Nothing can be
stated exactly until the results of the last
census are published, and that will take
several years.

The percentage of illegitimate births is
very high in Austria: in 1932 it was 27 per
cent. In the provinces Salzburg and Styria
about a third of all children are born out of
wedlock; in Carinthia the proportion is
over 42 per cent.!

The difference between the urban and
rural death-rates seems to be much smaller
than exists between the two birth-rates.
Infant mortality in Austria was 98 per 1,000
for legitimate and 128 for illegitimate births
in 1932. In Vienna the corresponding figures
were 66 and 116. Using the method of J.
Brownlee I have estimated the expectation
of life at birth: it is 55-3 years for males and
59°2 years for females.

2. RESEARCH AND TEACHING

Austria has no centre of eugenic research
and teaching ; but a number of independent
scientists are working in the field of heredity
and genetics. Among the most distinguished
may be named the botanist Tschermak, one
of the rediscoverers of the Mendelian laws,
the endocrinologist, Julius Bauer, and the
world-famous psychiatrist Wagner-Jauregg.
The last-named is chairman of the Society

259
260

for Human Heredity and Endocrinology
(Verein fiir menschliche Evblichkettslehre und
Endokrinologte) in Vienna.

In former years a course of eugenics was
held at the University of Vienna by Professor Heinrich Reichel. It was never
attended by more than a very few undergraduates. In 1933, Reichel was appointed
director of the hygienic institute of the
medical school at Graz University, and as a
result eugenics has disappeared from the
Vienna medical curriculum.

The general Press shows no interest for
eugenical problems ; nor does there exist in
the whole of Austria a single scientific or
popular journal devoted totally or partially
to eugenics.

3. THE ROMAN CATHOLIC POINT OF
VIEW

The “‘ New Austria ”’ is a catholic authoritarian State; its government is catholic ;
its new constitution claims to realize the
principles laid down in the papal encyclical
‘“ Quadragesimo Anno.”’ The Roman Church
dominates Austria, and it is therefore of
primary importance to know its position and
that of its adherents towards the problems
of eugenics.

The official document thereon is the
encyclical “‘ Casti Connubii.”” Being a message from the Pope it imposes binding rules
on the conduct of the faithful. It has been
so thoroughly surveyed in eugenics literature*
that it seems unnecessary to deal with it
again here.

On the other hand, it may be of interest to
discuss an attempt that has been made to
translate the general principles of ‘‘ Casti
Connubii’’ into concrete proposals. In
January 1934 a meeting was held in Vienna
to discuss “‘ The Position of the Family in
Nation and State.” Its sponsors were a
group of catholic sociologists ; and besides
them were present a great number of priests,
politicians, and carefully selected scientists
and medical men. Some members of the
government also took an active part. Many

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

resolutions were passed, most of them touching on problems of interest to eugenicists.

The most important points are sum
marized below.

1. Introduction of eugenical instruction in
the popular and the secondary schools
and of a compulsory course in eugenics
in the medical curriculum.

2. Establishment of ‘‘ maternity schools,”’
where the knowledge necessary for the
housewife and mother should be imparted by specially trained teachers.
To every maternity school should be
attached a home for mothers and infants where the girls might do practical
work. The maternity schooling should
be compulsory and free of charge.
Consent to marriage was to be given
only if a certificate from a maternity
school was presented.

3. Establishment of numerous marriage
consultation centres, organized on denominational lines.

4. Introduction of compulsory health certificates before engagement or at any
rate before marriage.

5. Prohibition of consanguineous marriages according to canonical law.

The eugenic value of the next two points
seems to be very doubtful :

6. Suppression of the production and the
sale of contraceptives and also of all
popular lectures about birth-control.
Needless to say, abortion is to remain
a capital crime.

7. Prohibition of castration and sterilization for any except therapeutic purposes—in plain terms, the prohibition
of eugenic sterilization. It was resolved
that the violation of this prohibition
should be punishable by imprisonment.

A number of further proposals encroach
on the economic field :

8. Income-tax rebates for families with
many children. Appropriate reductions
should also be granted from education
fees, and train, tram and bus fares.

g. Raising of the bachelor tax.

1o. Higher family allowances for public
servants, beginning from the third child.

1x. Establishment of compensation funds
for workers and employees within the
corporative organizations.

In connection with that meeting and to
perpetuate its ideas a Union for the Protection of the Family (Verband “ Familienschuiz’’) was founded. There is also a plan
to establish a “ family museum ”’ ; but up to
now only a Gregor Mendel memorial exhibition has been arranged at the natural history
museum (1889-1934).

4. THE PROBLEM OF RACE

Austria, like Central Europe in general, is
a country of very mixed race. The bulk of
the population is composed of brachycephalic
types, the dinaric and the alpine race. The
nordic admixture was estimated by H. F. K.
Guenther at 30 to 35 per cent. (But that was
before political relations between Germany
and Austria had become so strained ; to-day
the estimate would probably be much
lower!) The Mediterranean race forms only a
very small element in the population.

Race mixture is especially marked in
Vienna, where there are more than 200,000
Jews, and about the third part of the
remaining population is of Slav—especially
Czech—origin.

The extreme ‘ race theory,’”’ which is the
foundation of the Nazi doctrine, is against
the principles of the Roman Catholic Church.
There are no laws in Austria tending towards
a racial separation of ‘“‘ Aryans’ and Jews.

As Austria has no colonies, colour problems are of no importance.

5. NAZIS AND MARXISTS

The attitude of the Austrian Nazis towards
the problems of eugenics is of course exactly
the same as that of their German comrades.
They believe in the innate superiority of the
nordic race and the inevitable bad results of
race crossing. They approve of the racial
policy of the Third Realm. The “ nordic ”’
type of eugenics is also advocated by the
Viennese Society for Race Culture (Wiener
Gesellschaft fiir Rassenpflege).

The Austrian Marxists have never been

261

much interested in eugenical problems, environment and education occupying a far
more prominent place in their philosophy of
life. As a result of the desperate economic
conditions, neo-malthusian ideas are very
widely spread among the working classes.
Before the events of February 1934 there
were birth-control centres organized by the
social-democrats in all the twenty-one districts of Vienna. These were all immediately
dissolved by the government.

In this connection it may be added, however, that ‘‘ safe period calendars ’’ can be
seen in the window of every other bookshop
in Vienna. They are sold freely, “‘ safe
period ”’ intercourse being a method of birthcontrol approved by the Church. Unfortunately, it is not regarded as a safe method
by the majority of gynecologists.

6. APPLIED EUGENICS

Among the laws and administrative decrees of the ‘‘ New Austria ’’ only two are of
eugenic importance :

1. The so-called ‘‘ Law against Double
Earning ”’ (Doppelverdienergesetz). One
of its clauses decrees that female
public servants must lose their position on marriage. The idea was, of
course, to bring women back to their
natural functions as housewives and
mothers. The real result, however,
has been that numerous young teachers
and other qualified workers must remain unmarried, as the incomes now
prevailing among men are simply not
sufficient for maintaining a family.
Even the catholic meeting mentioned
above has raised objections against this
truly dysgenic measure.

2. The marriage consultation centre of the
Community of Vienna has been closed
by the new administration. It was
founded by Professor Tandler in 1922
as the first of its kind in Europe, and
was the only one of any importance in
Austria. In the twelve years of its
existence it was consulted by nearly
5,000 persons.
