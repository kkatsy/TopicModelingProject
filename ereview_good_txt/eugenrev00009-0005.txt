HUMAN DIVERSITY
KENNETH MATHER

What makes human beings different from one another? Why is it that each of us
is unique? Human diversity has been the subject of interest and speculation since
the beginning of man. It has been accepted as inevitable and bewailed as unjust;
made the basis of reverence and of persecution; attributed to divine creation and
to diabolical intervention. It has been traced to heredity and to the environment,
to ancestry and to upbringing, often with a gross distortion of the evidence and
a perverse interpretation of the conclusions. In this fascinating study Professor
Mather looks at the various causes of diversity—environmental, genetical and
social; sees how they act and interact; and examines the way natural selection is
related to and works on the differences they bring about.

Birth Control

IN THE MODERN WORLD
ELIZABETH DRAPER

A comprehensive account, that deals
thoroughly with every aspect of the
subject; the physiological, psychological
and eugenic considerations; the effect of
religious teaching, social climate, education and economic opportunity on motivation; what methods exist, how they are
evolved and _ distributed, and _ their
effectiveness assessed ; what public policies
and laws, and what medical and other
provisions relate to birth control; to what
extent and how effectively people use birth
control orcan beintroduced to itsuse; how
population is measured and by what means
increasing needs are forecast and met.
