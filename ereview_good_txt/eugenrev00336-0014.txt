OBSERVATIONS ON RACIAL
_CHARACTERISTICS IN ENGLAND.

By B. S. BramMwELL.
(Continuation*.)

In my first test I took the following names for my Northern
group :—Adamson, Alderson, Armstrong, Braithwaite, Carr, Clarkson,
Coulson, Crabtree, Dixon, Dobson, Farrar, Fawcett, Fenwick, Gibson,
Graham, Hislop, Hobson, Hodgson, Hudson, Hutchinson, Irving,
Jefferson, Jobson, Kay and Lawson. For my Welsh group I took the
following :—Bevan, David, Edmunds, Francis, George, Griffith,
Humphrys, James, Jenkins, Llewellyn, Lloyd, Morris, Owen, Parry,
Powell, Powys, Price, Pritchard, Rees, Richards and Willis. By a
fortunate chance the relative frequency of the two groups in this
second series appears to be practically identical with that in the first
series of names. The percentage of the Northern group in the total
for Finchley is here thirty-seven and a fraction, as against thirtyeight in the first series, and for Edinburgh eighty-four, as against
eighty-one. We can thus compare one series directly with the other
without injustice or, where names are scanty, make a compound series
which is also directly comparable.

I applied this series of names to the six larger Cambridge Tripos
lists and give the results in the same form as in the case of the first
series.

Converting these figures into the relative frequency in 10,000
names and: bearing in mind that the results from the smaller Tripos
lists where not many names are involved, cannot be so stable as those
from the three larger lists, we find the following results :—

OBSERVATIONS OF RACIAL CHARACTERISTICS. 557

There are some points of similarity between the two series. In
each Mathematics is the most frequent study of the Northern group
and the least frequent in the Welsh group. In each History is a
favourite study of the Welsh group. As compared with Finchley the
Northern names are with one exception much more frequent at
Cambridge. This tendency cannot be traced in the Welsh groups,
where the’frequency is more irregular. With regard to the Mathematical lists one should mention a point which tells rather against the
theory of racial preference in the choice of study. The mathematical
lists start as far back as 1758. In these lists the predominance of
Northern names is the most marked. Now if we take the period
1758—-1822 and compare it with the period 1823—-1871 and the period
1872—1910 we find that the relative frequency of the first Northern
group of names to the first Welsh group of names for these periods are
as follows :—818 : 225, 258 : 817, 265 : 808. I think that the
explanation of this change in the ratio between the first and the
second periods may be due to increased facilities of travel. Perhaps
there were fewer Welsh names in the earlier mathematical lists because
there were fewer Welsh names in Cambridge. The ratios for the second
and third periods are approximately the same. Now the other lists
do not go back to this first period when there were perhaps fewer of
the Welsh group in the University. So perhaps we should expect to
find the Welsh group relatively more frequent in these lists. There is,
however, no need to exaggerate the importance of these considerations.
If we refer to the second and third periods of the Mathematical
Tripos, we find that the percentage of Northern names in the total of
both groups is 45% for the second period and 46% for the third period.
These percentages are higher than those to be found in any of the five
other Tripos lists.

Let us now look at the relative number of first, second and third
class distinctions in the second series of names :—

558 EUGENICS REVIEW.

The result in the Mathematical Tripos is similar to that in the
former series, but less pronounced. In the Classical Tripos it is more
pronounced, but in the Science Tripos it in no way confirms that in
the previous series, and there is very little to choose between Northern
and Welsh. The three smaller Tripos lists also do not confirm the
former results to any marked extent.

I think, therefore, that our second summary of the position must
be rather more hesitating than the first one. The Northern groups
are more inclined to pursue mathematics than the Welsh groups and
seem to meet with more success in this study. They are perhaps a
little more inclined to study Classics, but here the Welsh groups
appear to be rather more successful. The Welsh groups are more
inclined to study history. This appears as far as we are justified in
going on the evidence so far adduced.

There are some smaller Tripos lists which repay examination.
As the number of candidates is small, I have added together the pairs
of groups which were previously examined separately. In one case
I have made a composite languages group, composed of the Semitic,
Indian, Oriental, and Medieval and Modern Languages Tripos lists :—

I also took out from the Cambridge lists particulars regarding
women. The figures refer to the first series of names only :—

Before passing on to consider figures drawn from other Universities, it is convenient to throw these Cambridge figures into one list.
I have added a few other instances. The Northern clement
diminishes from above downwards and the figure in brackets is the
percentage of Northern names in the total of both groups :—

One must not scrutinise the percentage figure too closely, as the
figures from which it is derived are sometimes large and sometimes
small. There are at least two anomalous results. Otherwise the
various entries from the same Tripos keep close together and the
list shows a fall from the more exact to the more argumentative
forms of study.

When one turns one’s attention to other Universities, a preliminary question is what is the normal percentage of Northern names in
the total. This naturally varies. I give a few instances :—

I have also the figures for Harvard University from 1636—1915.
I have had to omit the name Davies from the Welsh Group, as this
spelling appears to be rare in the States. One suspects that Davies
is concealed under Davis, which is common :—

Harvard ... wee 729 796 1535 48%

The corresponding percentages for Durham and Cambridge with
Davies omitted are 54% and 44% respectively. So the Northern
element in Harvard is high. Is this indicative of a greater roving disposition in the Northern element?

I gathered the following figures relating to the first series of
names from the Durham University Calendar :—

The percentages in the case of Armstrong College are nearly identical
with that for the general population of Newcastle. That for Durham
University members is much lower. This may be an indication that
the University partakes of a national rather than a_ provincial
character. The figures for Mathematics and Theology are small, but
are generally consistent with those of Cambridge.

I also took out some figures from the Oxford class lists. The
period taken is from 1901 to 1914. The names are those of the first
series :—

‘The Mathematical school is not in accord with our previous experience, but as the numbers in it are so small, we need not perhaps place
much reliance on them. Otherwise the list closely resembles the
Cambridge result. Science takes the place of Mathematics. Classics
come second, and Law, History and Theology fourth, fifth and sixth
in each list.

We have now considered a large volume of evidence dealing with
Universities and should summarise our conclusions before passing on to
consider professions and trades. There is evidence, firstly, that our
method of selected names is not unsound. Taking Finchley as our
standard, we find that Leeds, Durham and Cambridge show a
distinctly higher percentage of Northern names, and Oxford, London
University and the University of Wales a distinctly lower percentage.
The relative position of Oxford and Cambridge is in agreement with
Havelock Ellis’ statement in ‘* British Genius.’”? The percentage of
Northern namés at the Welsh University is exactly that which I
found in examining a list of Welsh International football players.
Coming now to the subjects of study, we have, I think, undoubted
evidence that the Northerners are more prone to study mathematics
than the Welsh group. We have some evidence that this is also true
of Mechanics. It is also true to a lesser extent of Classics. We have
OBSERVATIONS OF RACIAL CHARACTERISTICS. 561

evidence that they are better at Mathematics, but probably not so
good at Classics. In Natural Science the Northerners preponderate at
Durham and Oxford. At Cambridge this subject is about the border
line. This may be due to the great prestige of the Mathematical
school drawing to it students who at other Universities would take
to the study of Science direct. Northerners are probably less inclined
to study Law, certainly less inclined to study History, and assuredly
less inclined to study Theology. We have some evidence that this is
true also of Oriental and Modern Languages.

Let us now turn to figures from the professions. They refer to
names of the first series. They are drawn from two sources, the
annual year books of the professions and the London Directory.
Some therefore refer to the country at large and others only to
London. As I have no direct means of judging whether the ratio
between the two groups is different, taking London and England as
a whole, it might perhaps have been better to separate the figures
into two lists. Such evidence as I have, however, inclines me to
think that the difference is slight. In some cases the figures are large
and in others small. In nine instances the figures have been
standardised to frequency per 10,000; in the later figures I have not
made this standardisation which is unnecessary for purposes of comparison if the percentage of Northerners in the total is given, and
indeed, by obscuring the actual figures upon which this percentage is
based, deprives us of a ready means of judging how much weight
should be attached to any individual result. The entry Air-pilots
refers to the names in a list of the first airmen to win their certificates.
The actual number in the list was a little over 2,000, but the figures
here given are standardised :—

Several of these entries refer to the same profession; others fall
into analogous groups. The only serious anomaly is the divergence of
the two groups of Accountants. I think that there is a distinct
resemblance to the order in the University Class Lists. Mechanics,
Mathematics, Science, Law and Theology. There is certainly a descent
from constructive and scientific to more argumentative and oratorical
pursuits. Also possibly from the more hazardous to the less
adventurous.

I next considered Trades. Here, with one exception, that of
** Old Clockmakers,’’ which is taken from Mr. F. J. Britten’s book,
the figures are all derived from the London Directory. The period of
the Clockmakers ends in 1842 and the area from which they are taken
is a wide one as it includes America. None of the figures are
standardised :—

Dairymen _ 9 350 359 2%

The list generally is instructive. As we work down it, we pass
from constructive trades more and more into a region of pure retail.
The position of .butchers is of interest, as it has been stated that
butchers tend to be fair and shoemakers to be dark. (See British
Genius, p. 86.) It is commonly said that butchers are a prosperous
folk and rarely go bankrupt, whereas with drapers the reverse is said
to be the case. The position of dairymen puzzled me so much that I
thought there must be some error. The possibility of multiple shops
occurred to me, though I could not trace their existence to any marked
extent in the Directory. To clear it up, I tested the matter with my
second series of names and obtained exactly the same percentage. It
is clear therefore that this industry is very largely in the hands of the
Welsh group. Speaking generally, the conclusions to be drawn from
this list are analogous to those already drawn from the professional
and University lists. We might perhaps sum the matter up by saying
that in pursuits where proficiency depends on mechanical or constructive skill, the Northern element appears prominent, but if proficiency
depends on the spoken word or argument or persuasion, then the
Welsh element is more strongly represented than one would anticipate.
I think, too, that we might note as a hypothesis worthy of examination that the rewards in the pursuits favoured by the Northern group
are more certain; the pursuits favoured by the Welsh group are more
precarious, though success in them offers big prizes.

This finishes my detailed examination of University Class lists,
Professions and Trades. I have, however, some other lists of figures
which may be used for the purpose of testing the conclusions which I
have drawn. The first is of a miscellaneous character :—

Here again we notice the same descent from the more scientific
and exact qualities. The position of the J.P.s is very similar to that
found for legal pursuits in other lists. It will be noted that the percentage for the Telephone Directory comes out at two points less than
that for Finchley residents. As the numbers involved are in each
case substantial, I verified this observation by means of my second
list of names. I there found that the Telephone percentage came out
four points iower than the Finchley percentage.

As a further test for some of these conclusions, I turned my
attention to the staffs of some of the Government offices. I took two
where one would conclude that the characteristics peculiar to those
pursuits which the Northern group appear to favour would be of
advantage, namely, the Examiners and Staff of the Patent Office and
the Engineering Staff of the Post Office, and compared them with the
clerical staff of the Board of Education where such characteristics
OBSERVATIONS OF RACIAL CHARACTERISTICS. 565

would not be of the same advantage. The numbers are small, but the
result is certainly confirmatory :— |

These figures, I think, furnish a strong SOnITENGtIgr of my argument.

It is sometimes argued that as so much intermixture has taken
place in our island that there can be little possibility of
tracing racial differences. The argument takes this form.
Twenty-five generations back one could have had thirty-three
million separate ancestors. At that period the population of
these islands was probably in the neighbourhood of six millions. Therefore the probability is that everyone is descended from everyone
alive at that time who has now living descendants. This is pure conjecture. It is incapable of proof or disproof. No one will ever know
more than a very small fraction of their possible 66,000,000 ancestors
im the last 25 generations or all the people alive in England 700 years
ago. If the material were available it would take a large Government
Office months to collate it. We can, however, get some interesting
sidelights on the subject from the study of genealogies. Whatever the
answer to the above conjecture may be, genealogies show us that we
are probably descended many times over and through many different
lines of descent from the same individual. I have one in my possession relating to people alive at the present day. An ancestor who
died in 1606 was descended five times over from a man and his wife
who died about 1250. Now this ancestor who died in 1606 only forms
an eight thousandth part of the present day people’s pedigree and of
his pedigree back to 1250 I only possess about one two hundredth
part. In this one million six hundredth part these names appear five
times, how many times may they not appear in the whole circle of
twenty-fifth generation ancestors? I think that by asking the aid of
some of the Genealogical societies we might be able to obtain very
interesting information on the amount of intermarriage in certain
cases. It should be possible to work out pedigrees of Royalty and
566 EUGENICS REVIEW.

some of the Nobility fairly completely in every direction for the last
ten generations. |

_ An argument which appears to me to have more force is that we
may in the last hundred years have started to fuse at a rapid rate. I
think that I have produced some evidence to show that fusion is not
complete. By a study of, say the London Directories, during the last
hundred years, we might be able to throw some light on this problem.
Are the various surnames becoming more uniformly distributed in
the various occupations ?

Let us conclude by trying to summarise the whole matter. We
have found that the lists of names used are typical of geographical
areas. When these lists are applied to occupations carried on in some
neutral area such as Cambridge University, the County of London or
England as a whole, distinctive mental characteristics are noticeable
in the two groups. These differences suggest that racial fusion has
not as yet been completed in our country, so far as mental qualities
are concerned. It is difficult to believe that environment can account
for say the curious position with regard to dairymen in London. One
naturally asks ‘‘What environment? ’? Ex hypothesi it cannot be
that of London which is identical for the two groups. One concludes
that it must be due to race, but it is argued against this conclusion
that we must not regard our population as made up of two types, that
there is every gradation of long-head to be found amongst us between
the pure Nordic and the pure Mediterranean, and that many of these
long-heads have not arisen from those races at all. Also that in
addition there is a considerable percentage of broadheaded people.
This may well be without affecting my argument. Such _ scanty
material as I had available in the Cambridge names disclosed a large
percentage of brachicephalic types. But I have no status to argue
on anthropological matters. My point is that I chose the names of
my Northern group from that part of the country which was greatly
subjected to incursions of Angles and Danes in historic times, and
applying these names to occupations in neutral areas, I have demonstrated mental differences when they are compared with names
drawn from Wales and the Welsh border. If these names cover 2
large fraction in each group which is identical racially, then deducting this common fraction one would imagine that the differences so
far from disappearing would be still more marked.

It would be easy to exaggerate the mental differences found.
At the same time it is claimed that they are quite distinctive. In
the one case a greater tendency towards construction, creation and
such exercises as yield “fruit”? in the Baconian sense and in the
higher planes the pursuit of a train of thought a step or two further
than most can ; in fact, a slightly greater tendency to exercise pure
reason. In the other case, the oral word, argument, the appeal to
the emotions. The one slightly inclined to look forward, the other
slightly inclined to look back. We have seen that more Senior
Wranglers and Fellows of the Roval Society than we should anticipate come from the Northern source. One would exnect to find more
Welsh names on the Jndicial Rench. As reeards the other Pench,
I found in a list of Bishops of the last eighty years seven Welsh
OBSERVATIONS OF RACIAL CHARACTERISTICS. 567

names as against two Northern. Now, if these differences can be discerned between groups which are not racially pure and not racially
far removed from each other, what may we not anticpate. where the
distinction between two races is marked.

I hope at some future time to follow up this investigation with
a study of some physical and moral qualities, such as the incidence
of various diseases, longevity, crime in its various branches, suicide,
immorality as instanced in the Divorce Courts, bankruptcy, mental
defect and pauperism. At present my facts regarding these subjects
are too few to warrant publication.
