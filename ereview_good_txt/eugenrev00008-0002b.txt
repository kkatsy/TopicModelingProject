Dermatoglyphics in XXYY Klinefelter’s Syndrome by MILTON ALTER, ROBERT GORLIN, JORGE
YUNIS, FREDRICK PEAGLER and HEINZ BRUHL.

The main dermatoglyphic features of this variant of Klinefelter’s syndrome included low
ridge count, unusual hypothenar patterns, rather wider atd angle (summed for the two hands)
than in controls, ulnar displaced proximal triradii and simian lines. Results of the present study
support those of Uchida et al. (1964).

Population Genetic Studies in the Congo. I. Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency,
Hemoglobin S, and Malaria by A. G. MOTULSKY, J. VANDEPITTE and G. R. FRASER.

Hb S was the only abnormal haemoglobin found in the populations studied, and the distribution of the S gene roughly corresponded to that of G6PD deficiency. The Pygmies were an exception in having a very high frequency of sickling but low frequency of G6PD deficiency, possibly
explained by shortened red cell survival—resulting in abnormally high red cell enzyme levels—
due to chronic illness. Falciparum malaria was common, three quarters of the older children in
six Yaka villages being infected, and infection rates were similar in sicklers and in enzyme-deficient
subjects. The combined data indicate protection by these two traits against malaria, G6PDdeficiency
probably being the less effective of the two.

Population Genetic Studies in the Congo. II. Effect of Hemoglobin S and Glucose-6-Phosphate
Dehydrogenase Deficiency on Mortality and Fertility by G. R. FRASER.

There is some evidence to suggest that Hb AS people and females heterozygous for G6PD
deficiency in the Congolese populations may be more fertile than their normal homozygotes. Sibs
of Hb AS individuals showed a higher mortality than sibs of Hb A individuals, possibly indicating
a relative disadvantage of the former, once infancy—the critical period for malarial immunity—
is passed. |

Population Genetic Studies in the Congo. III. Blood Groups (ABO, MNSs, Rh, Js? ) by G. R.
FRASER, E. R. GIBLETT and A. G. MOTULSKY.

The Pygmies, as would be expected from their unique ethnic character, showed blood group
frequencies distinct from the other tribal groups studied.

Population Genetic Studies in the Congo. IV. Haptoglobin and Transferrin Serum Groups in the
Congo and in Other African Populations by E. R. GIBLETT, A. G. MOTULSKY and G. R. FRASER.

There was a high frequency of Hp! as in most other areas of Africa.

Genetic Linkage Between Structural Loci for Albumin and Group Specific Component (Gc) by L. R.
WEITKAMP, D. L. RUCKNAGEL and H. GERSHOWITZ.

There was only one recombinant in forty-two informative offspring for whom both parents
were genotyped. The map distance between the two loci is calculated as about 1-5 per cent.

Familial Reciprocal C/18 Translocation by HOPE H. PUNNET, LEONARD PINSKY, ANGELO M.
DIGEORGE and ROBERT J. GORLIN.

This is the first reported instance of a presumed familial translocation between chromosome
18 and a member of the C group. The proband showed a rare constellation of congenital abnormalities including mental retardation, while several “‘carriers” of the balanced translocation were
phenotypically normal.

Hemoglobin Kagoshima: An Example of Hemoglobin Norfolk in a Japanese Family by
TAKSHI IMAMURA.

The haemoglobin described is a fast-moving variant of Hb A; it is probably identical with
haemoglobin Norfolk.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Family Studies of a Human Serum Isoantigen System (Australia Antigen) by B. s. BLUMBERG,
LIISA MELARTIN, R. A. GUINTO and BARBARA WERNER.

This newly discovered serum protein—probably a lipoprotein—behaved as an autosomal
recessive trait in the families studied. The trait has widely different population frequencies, being
absent in US whites and Negroes but common in several East Asian and Pacific populations. It
is COMmoner in younger age groups and, in some populations, in males, and an individual’s
phenotype (including those with leukaemia and thalassaemia) appears to be constant over a period
of time.

The Frequency of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency in the Newborns and Adults in
Kuwait by YEHIA SHAKER, A. ONSI and R. AZIZ.

The overall incidence of this trait was 22:3 per cent in newborns and 20-4 per cent in adult
males. H. BLYTH

Hereditary Multiple Epiphysial Dysplasia by D. HOEFNAGEL, L. K. SYCAMORE, S. W. RUSSELL
and W. E. BUCKNALL.
A pedigree of the above syndrome is reported and discussed.

The Linkage Relation of Xg to G6PD in Israelis: the evidence of a second series of families.
A. ADAM, PATRICIA TIPPETT, JUNE GAVIN, JEAN NOADES, RUTH SANGER and R. R. RACE.

Further evidence indicates that the linkage between Xg and G6PD is not as close as was
previously thought.

Further Studies on the Genetics of Placental Alkaline Phosphatase by ELIZABETH B. ROBSON and
HARRY HARRIS.

Six common and nine rare phenotypes of human placental alkaline phosphatase are described.
Evidence from both single and twin births strongly suggests that they are determined by three
common and six rare alleles at an autosomal locus of the foetus. Frequencies among Negroes are
different from those in an English population. A model is proposed to account for the triple-banded
pattern of heterozygotes.

Data on Linkage between the Locus Determining Placental Alkaline Phosphatase (Pl) and other
Markers by J. H. EDWARDS and JUNE WINGHAM.

Twin data revealed no evidence of linkage between the locus for placental alkaline phosphate
and eleven other markers.

Sex-linked Genes in Man and the Lyon Hypothesis by HANS GRUNEBERG.
A review of sixty sex-linked genes in man fails to support the Lyon hypothesis.

A Statistical Study of Intrauterine Selection Factors related to the ABO System. I. The analysis of
data on liveborn children by ERIC PERITZ.

Data on the ABO frequencies in live-born children from different mating types are described
and discussed.

Taste Polymorphism to Anetholtrithione and Phenylthiocarbamate by w. DAWSON, G. B. WEST and
H. KALMUS.

The distribution of the taste threshold of anetholtrithione (ATTH) is bimodal. There is a
very high correlation between the thresholds for ATTH and for PTC, and it is concluded that the
two polymorphisms are identical.

Is Weinberg’s Differential Rule Defective? by K. 0. RENKONEN.

Weinberg’s rule for estimating the frequencies of monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the
frequencies of like-sexed and unliked-sexed twins gives a lower proportion of monozygotic twins

288

in the adult population than at birth. The author considers this a defect in Weinberg’s rule, but it
seems to the reviewer to be simply a consequence of the differential mortality of the two types
of twins.

May 1967, Vol. 30, Part 4.

Haemoglobin Bart’s Hydrops Foetalis in Thailand by s. POOTRAKUL, P. WASI and S. NA-NAKORN.

Fifteen cases of the above syndrome are described, all of whom died before or shortly after
birth. Familial studies indicate that the syndrome is caused by homozygosity for an a-thalassaemia
gene.

Pericentric Inversion in a Group D Chromosome (13-15) associated with Amenorrhea and Gonadal
Dysgenesis by M. M. COHEN, V. J. CAPRARO and N. TAKAGI.

A case is reported of a woman with amenorrhea and rudimentary ovaries associated with an
abnormality of one of the chromosomes in the 13-15 group.

DNA Replication Analysis of Six 13-15/21 Translocation Families by MARGARETA MIKKELSEN.

Autoradiographic studies were performed on nine individuals from six families having a
translocation of a chromosome in the 13-15 group with chromosome 21 in order to determine
which of the chromosomes 13-15 was involved. It was found to be chromosome 14 in five families
and chromosome 15 in one family.

The Effect of Mutation on Fitness in a System of Two Co-adapted Loci by JOHN R. G. TURNER.

It is shown that mutation at polymorphic loci may have little effect on fitness when the loci
are considered singly, but that the effect may be comparatively large when two epistatic loci are
considered simultaneously.

Neighbourhood Knowledge and the Distribution of Marriage Distances by A. J. BOYCE, C. F.
KUCHEMANN and G. A. HARRISON.

A model is proposed to explain the distribution of marriage distances, and is tested on data
for an Oxfordshire parish from the 1861 census.

Inherited Quantitative Variations of Human Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase by c. w. PARR and
LINDA I, FITCH.
The pedigrees of two families with deficiencies of the above enzyme are described and discussed.

Electrophoretic Variants of Human 6-Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase: population and family
studies and description of a new variant by RONALD G. DAVIDSON.

The electrophoretic pattern of the above enzyme was determined in a large population of
whites and negroes. A new variant was discovered as well as a racial difference in the frequencies
of the two common alleles. Family studies indicate that all the variants are due to autosomal
co-dominant alleles.

Hereditary Elliptocytosis: linkage data in man by R. A. GEERDINK, L. E. NIJENHUIS and J.
HUIZINGA.

Data on six Dutch families indicate that there are two types of elliptocytosis, one of which
is closely linked to the Rhesus factor and the other of which is not. There is evidence that these
two types are biochemically as well as genetically distinct.

On the Effects of Natural Selection on Correlations between Relatives by CAROLYN R. LEACH and
O. MAYO.

Correlations for fitness between sibs and between parent and offspring at loci which affect
fitness are considered and discussed.

A Comparison of some Properties of Human Red Cell Acid Phosphatase in different Phenotypes by
JILL E. LUFFMAN @nd HARRY HARRIS.

The biochemical properties of red cell acid phosphatase i in different phenotypes are compared
and contrasted.

August 1967, Vol. 31, Part I.
The Inheritance of Liability to Diseases with variable Age of Onset, with particular reference to

Diabetes Mellitus by p. s. FALCONER.

A method of analysing familial data proposed in a previous paper is extended to diseases with
variable age of onset, and is applied to published data on diabetes mellitus. It is concluded that
the heritability of liability to diabetes decreases with increasing age, largely due to an increase of
environmental variation. It is also concluded that cases with early onset are genetically different
from cases with late onset.

Matched Pairs and Randomization Sets by F. N. DAVID and P. J. KIM.

A new randomization test is proposed for analysing multidimensional matched-pair data,
and is applied to some intelligence test data.

Column Chromatograpy of Human Red Cell Acid Phosphatase by D. A. HOPKINSON and HARRY
HARRIS.

The five common phenotypes of human red cell acid phosphatase were examined by ionexchange chromatography. It is concluded that two main isoenzymes are present in each of the
three postulated homozygous types, which differ from each other in net charge.

A Study of Defective Colour Vision with the Ishihara Test Plates by G. J. GORRELL.

A survey of a hospital population failed to reveal any association between colour blindness
and alcoholism or cirrhosis.

X-Linked Cataract by M. FRACCARO, G. MORONE, U. MANFREDINI and RUTH SANGER.

A pedigree of cataract is described which is thought likely to be sex-linked, but which could
be due to an autosomal, sex-limited gene.

Down’s Syndrome at Young Maternal Age: Cytogenetical and genealogical study of eighty-one
families by MARGARETA MIKKELSEN.

Cytogenetical and genealogical data are presented for 100 children with Down’s syndrome
born to mothers under thirty.

The Relation of Ethnic and Selected Socio-economic Factors to Human Birth-weight by ALFRED F.
NAYLOR and NTINOS C. MYRIANTHOPOULOS,

The effects of several socio-economic factors on the birth weight of White, Negro and Puerto
Rican babies in the United States are described and discussed.

A Theoretical Approach to the Study of Genetic Parameters of Histocompatibility in Man by
G. LUNGHI.

The author maintains that his model of histocompatibility, proposed in 1965, is the same as
that presented by Serra and O’Mathuna in the following year.

Taste Sensitivity to Phenylthiocarbamide of Korean Population by yUNG SUN KANG, WAN KYOO
CHO and KEUN SUNG YURN.

Very careful examinations for PTC taste sensitivity and thresholds were made on 403 males
and 368 females since non-tasters “are affected by a simple autosomal recessive gene”, and the
frequency of non-tasters varies “considerably among races and ethnic groups”’. These facts prompted
this investigation into the hereditary characters of the population of the Korean peninsula, situated
as it is between China and Japan.

Red/Green Color Blindness in the Niger Delta by D. F. ROBERTS.

This paper studies the frequencies of this type of colour blindness in two African populations
of the Niger Delta and discusses various hypotheses for the differences and similarities.

Changes in Age at Marriage of Females and Their Effect on the Birth Rate in India by kK. Gc.
BASAVARAJAPPA and M. I. BELVALGIDAD.

The Times of India recently carried an editorial asking the Government to consider raising the
legal age of marriage to nineteen for females and twenty-one for males with a view to reducing
fertility. The joint authors of this paper examine the question very closely and conclude that the
proposed measure would prove ineffective.

Social and Economic Characteristics of Aged Persons (65 years old and over) in the United States in
1960 by MARIA DAVIDSON.

Based on the data derived from the 1960 Census, this paper investigates the changes “‘that
occurred in the labor force participation, occupational groups, earning, and physical mobility
among persons of 65 years and over as compared with younger age groups”. |

Attitudes of Parents of Retarded Children Toward Voluntary Sterilization by MEDORA S. BASS.

The chief lesson to be learned from this investigation of 132 parents of retarded children is
that the primary obstacle is simple ignorance—and the need is for the basic facts to be more
readily available.

Techniques of Stratified Sampling in the Study of Variation of the Human Sex Ratio by MARIANNE F.
BERNSTEIN.

Evidence is presented to show that the technique of stratified sampling is essential in studying
genetic, environmental and anthropological causes of sex ratio variation.

Family Size in the 1960s—A Baffling Fad? by JUDITH BLAKE.

A growing belief that—far from a population explosion—the United States crude birth rate
is declining receives in this paper a careful scientific analysis. Actual figures give only very slight
confirmation of the belief.

Haemoglobin J Tongariki (a 115 Alanine->Aspartic Acid): the first new haemoglobin variant found
in a Pacific (Melanesian) population by D. C. GAJDUSEK, J. GUIART, R. L. KIRK, R. W. CARRELL,
D. IRVINE, P. A. M. KYNOCH and H. LEHMANN.

A haemoglobin variant, Hb J Tongariki, was found in 17 of 228 blood samples from inhabitants

of the island of Tongariki. Chemical investigation revealed difference in the «-chain, summarised
as 0, 115Ala>Asp§?_ The origin of the variant is discussed.

Genetics of the Dombrock Blood Group System by PATRICIA TIPPETT.

Tests with anti-Do* on 755 unrelated people of Northern European ancestry are reported.
The corresponding gene frequencies are: Do*=0-420; Do=0:580

The antigen Do* behaved as a dominant character in 201 Northern European families with
573 children and in 76 Israeli families with 224 children. The locus responsible for the Dombrock
system was found not to be closely linked to the loci responsible for the established blood group
systems or to those for various biochemical characters of the blood.

Xg Blood Group Frequencies in Some Further Populations by WILLIAM J. DEWEY and JOSEPH D.
MANN with the assistance of C. E. JACKSON, WILLIAM BOUMAN, H. SAMUEL NOORDHOFF,
T. C. WU and HARVEY DOORENBOS.

The frequency of the blood types in the Xg system has now been studied in a number of
populations. The published frequency data are summarized. Intergroup differences exist, but in all
populations so far studied both alleles are found with relatively high frequencies.

Endemic Goitre in Greece: A Study of 379 Twin Pairs by B. MALAMOS, D. A. KOUTRAS, P. KOSTAMIS,
G. A. RIGOPOULOS, N. S. ZEREFOS and X. A. YATAGANAS.

In 109 villages in the endemic goitre areas of Greece, 379 twin pairs were examined for the
presence of goitre. Monozygotic pairs showed a statistically significant higher concordance rate
than did dizygotic. It is concluded that heredity plays a role in predisposition.

Agar Diffusion Test for Serum Cholinesterase Typing and Influence of Temperature on Dibucaine
and Fluoride Numbers by GEORGE LEE and J. C. ROBINSON.

The results in the cholinesterase typing of 392 plasmas by the agar diffusion test were fully
confirmed by the spectrophotometric determination of dibucaine numbers. The main advantage of
the agar diffusion test is the simplicity with which dibucaine variants can be detected. In this case
the test was of no value in detecting the UF phenotype. The dibucaine number and the fluoride
number were found to be inverse functions of temperature. The change in fluoride number per
degree was roughly four times as great as the change in dibucaine number. Furthermore, the
magnitude of the change of the fluoride number with temperature was greater with the U than with
the UF plasmas. By using the spectrophotometric method, the distinction between U and I
dibucaine variants was apparent at 26°C., but the U and UF groups could not be clearly separated.
Since previous investigators have determined fluoride numbers at 21-25°C., and since the distinction
between U and UF is less marked when fluoride numbers are determined at raised temperatures,
this failure to distinguish clearly these phenotypes may be related to the temperature effect.

Myotonic Dystrophy and Polycystic Disease of the Kidneys by A. E. H. EMERY, S. OLEESKY and R. T.
WILLIAMS.

A family with myotonic dystrophy is described in which three affected sibs also had polycystic
disease of the kidneys. Apparently this association has not been described previously.

Age, Sex, and ABO Blood Group Distributions of 150 Patients with Cerebral Arteriovenous Aneurysms
by R. R. STRANG.

The age, sex, and ABO blood group distributions of 150 patients with an intracerebral
arteriovenous aneurysm have been analysed. These lesions are most frequent in males (57 per cent).
A verified diagnosis is most commonly made between the ages of twenty and forty-nine years in
males, and between thirty and thirty-nine years in females. The ABO blood distribution showed a
significant reduction of Group A (x2=9-86; p< 0-02).

Transferrin Variants in Greeks by B. ANGELOPOULOS, A. KALOS and E, DANOPOULOS.

Transferrin variants were studied by the vertical method of starch gel electrophoresis in 2050
Greek adults: 2041 were of the phenotype CC, six of the phenotype CD), and three of the phenotype
CB. In the Greek population, the frequency of gene C is 0-9978, of gene D, it is 0-0015, and of
gene Bz it is 0-0007.

Experimental Red Cell Chimerism in the Heterozygote (W'w) of the W-Series Mutants in the House
Mouse by MARY J. SELLER.

Foetal liver cells from either of two haematologically normal strains of mice (A and CBA)
were injected at birth into slightly anaemic animals of the genotype WYw. When adult, these animals
had a peripheral blood picture which was typical of the normal donor strain. The electrophoretic
pattern of the haemoglobins of both the treated series of WYw animals was of the diffuse, 2-banded
type, of the CBA and A donor strains, instead of the usual single pattern of the W-series. It is
implied that donor haematopoietic tissue has implanted and is functioning normally in the anaemic
animals.

Presumptive Y/D Translocation in Mixed Gonadal Dysgenesis by DANIEL D. FEDERMAN, FRANK M.
DAVIDOFF and EILEEN OUELLETTE.

A twenty-three-year-old chromatin negative woman with mixed gonadal dysgenesis is reported.
Cytogenetic study of six tissues showed a modal number of forty-five with karyotype mosaicism,
some cells being XO and others interpreted as showing a Y/D translocation. Clinical investigations
are fully reported.

Comparison of Mitotic Growth Rates of Human Capillary Whole Blood Cultured in a Variety of
Media by NUTAN P. BISHUN.

Three microblood cultures were set up from each of fifty-five subjects, using differing cultural
conditions, and mitotic indices determined. It was shown that the bloods cultured in AB serum
and T.C.199 gave a significantly higher growth rate (measured by the mitotic index) than those
cultured in AB serum, T.C.199, and C.E.E. (chick embryo extract) or T.C.199 alone.

Hydronephrosis in Mouse, Rat, and Man by MARGARET E. WALLACE and §, G. SPICKETT.

Hereditary hydronephrosis is described in the mouse, the rat and man. In the mouse, the
differing incidence in different strains is described and its genetic significance in aetiology discussed.
The two types of hydronephrosis, with and without ureteric obstruction, are described, as are their
causes and genetic significance. The sex difference of both the incidence and severity of the lesion
and its relationship to the genetic strain is also discussed. In the rat strain studied, hydronephrosis
is almost limited to the male, generally affecting the right kidney. The mode of inheritance is
uncertain. The pattern of sex-limitation and symmetry in mouse is similar to that among cases of
urogenital malformations in man which are associated with external ear deformity. This suggests
pleiotropy of a single gene in both species, the gene in each species having somewhat similar action.
The mechanism of hydronephrosis in man and in mouse is discussed. Comparisons indicate that
experiments with mice may aid elucidation of cause and control in man.

Hypoplastic Left Heart Complex by EVA D. ALBERMAN, JEAN M. FEDRICK and W. H. SCHUTT.

Birth weight, length of gestation, associated malformations and parental age were documented
for fifty cases of hypoplastic left heart complex. The children were either stillborn or died in the
neonatal period. It is considered that this complex is a heterogeneous group with one subgroup,
interruption of the aorta, contrasting sharply with the others in sex and parental age distribution.
In this sample, a feature of the remaining cases, particularly those with aortic valve obstruction
uncomplicated by other types of cardiac or extracardiac malformation, was a high mean parental
age. The relevance of such a finding is briefly discussed.

High Incidence of Haemoglobin Gaccra in a Rural District in Jamaica by P. F. MILNER

The finding of Hb Gaccra in 2:3 per cent of a rural population in Jamaica is reported. This
haemoglobin has only once been reported before, this in an African family. The present finding of a
high incidence is attributed to inbreeding in a relatively static community.

Chromosomes of Human Endometrium by Cc. ELIZABETH BOWEY and A. I. SPRIGGS.

The chromosome complements of twenty-two specimens of non-malignant human endometrium
are described. A direct technique was used. The chromosome number was found to be forty-six.
Where karyotyping was possible, a normal karyotype was found.

Serum Alkaline Phosphatase Types in North American Indians and Negroes by J. C. ROBINSON, C.
LEVENE, B. S. BLUMBERG @nd J. E. PIERCE.

Serum alkaline phosphatase variations were examined by starch gel electrophoresis on three
populations: Montagnais and Naskapi Indians, and Sapelo Island Negroes. The action of neuraminidase on the phosphatase bands is presented, and the presence of a pregnancy band was
demonstrated in ten of the persons investigated from the Montagnais and Naskapi. The frequency
of phosphatase 2 (Pp 2) was 71-9 per cent in the Montagnais, 68-6 per cent in the Naskapi, and
63:3 per cent in the Sapelo Island Negroes. The association with ABO blood groups and ABH
secretor phenotypes is described. The non-association with other blood groups and with the Ge
serum groups is also noted.

Blood Groups and Leprosy by FRANCISCO M. SALZANO.

Data concerning the incidence of blood groups and leprosy obtained in many countries have
been pooled and analysed. In this very large series, there is no indication of any differential susceptibility to leprosy, or its forms, amongst the various ABO and Rh phenotypes.

Leprosy and ABO Blood Groups by GURMOHAN SINGH and DIVAKAR OJHA.

ABO blood groups were studied in 633 leprosy patients and compared with 2,583 controls.
No relationship between blood groups and susceptibility to the disease, or type of the disease,
was found.

Combination of Spherocytosis and a Variant of Beta Thalassaemia (‘Isolated Raised Hb A2’) by
T. A, CUNNINGHAM and F. VELLA.

A case report is presented of a male Jordanian of Syrian origin in whom the combination of
spherocytosis and a beta thalassaemia variant (isolated raised haemoglobin Az level) occurred.
This is the first description of this combination of hereditary intrinsic abnormalities of the
erythrocyte. There was no evidence of interaction between the two genes. The genetic combination
was asymptomatic and was discovered during routine pre-operative investigation.

Ovarian Dysgerminoma in Three Generations? by STEWART M. JACKSON.

A Jamaican family with members of three generations developing ovarian tumours, two of
whom were known to have had dysgerminomas, is reported. The possibility of this being a random
association is discussed.

A Familial Variant Chromosome in the 13-15 Group by PATRICIA M. LORD and PATRICIA COOKE.

An easily distinguished variant chromosome in the thirteen to fifteen group is described in
tissues from a phenotypically normal father and daughter. Measurements of the abnormal chromosome and their use in positioning chromosomes within their group is discussed.

Ring Chromosome 18 in a Patient with Multiple Anomalies by CATHERINE G. PALMER, NUZHAT
FAREED and A. DONALD MERRITT.

A ten-year-old boy with multiple congenital abnormalities and a ring chromosome 18 is
described. The findings of other patients with ring chromosome 18 are summarized and compared
with the present patient and with the two syndromes manifested by deletions of the long or short
arm of chromosome 18. The patient had characteristics of both syndromes, thus suggesting the
loss of segments of both long and short arms.

Chromosome Mosaicism in a Mentally Retarded Mother and Her Daughter by CARMEN B. LOZZIO,
GUILLERMO R. JAUREGUI, JUAN C. SCORNAVACHI and MIGUEL A. GAMBIN.

Mosaicism 46/47 was observed in a mentally retarded girl seventeen years old, and in her
mother, who was also mentally deficient. The girl presented with obesity, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. Increased serotonin levels were found in the blood, but decreased excretion of 5-OH
indolacetic acid was demonstrated in the urine. The mother was also obese and exhibited low 5-OH
indolacetic acid excretion. Two other sibs were mentally retarded but were not studied cytogenetically. The karyotypes of the mother, studied in blood culture, and the chromosomes of the
daughter, obtained from one bone-marrow and two blood cultures, showed a normal cell line and
one trisomic for a small acrocentric chromosome. The extra chromosome appeared to be, morphologically, one of group G (21-22). The cytogenetic findings and the phenotypic expression are dis

cussed. It is concluded from this that the additional chromosome is unlikely to be either a
chromosome 21 or 22 or a Y chromosome or a deleted X chromosome. The most probable
explanation is that it is a centric fragment of another autosome.

A Patient with 45XO/48XYYY Mosaicism by DAVID COX and C. L. BERRY.

A male pseudohermaphrodite with hypospadias, a uterus with blindly-ending Fallopian tubes,
and a single testis on the right side is described. He is of normal intelligence and his height and
weight are at the sixth centile. Chromosome analysis revealed an XO/KYYY mosaic sex chromosome pattern.

Trisomy D; (13-15) Associated with XO/XY Mosaicism by N. E. FRANCE, P. G. H. EVISON, L. J.
BUTLER, G. J. A. I. SNODGRASS, L. CROME and C. G. KEITH.

A male child is described with congenital malformations which are commonly associated with
the trisomy D, (13-15) syndrome. In addition, a sacral meningomyelocele and an Arnold-Chiari
malformation were present. The external genitalia were hypoplastic, there was a rudimentary
uterus, and the gonads were absent. Cytogenetic studies revealed seven chromosomes in group D
(13-15) representing probable trisomy 13. In addition, sex chromosome mosaicism of the type
XO/XY was demonstrated. The major anomalies, including ocular defects and intersexuality, are
discussed in relation to the chromosomal findings. DAVID J. MANTLE

Fertility Differentials as Evidence of Incipient Fertility Decline in a Developing Country. The Case
of Ghana by J. Cc. CALDWELL.

This paper is concerned mainly with the analysis of fertility on the basis of the 1960 Census
data. The author finds a significant difference in the experience of the towns and the countryside,
even after making allowance for the special difficulties of interpretation in this respect which are
present in Ghana. Dr. Caldwell finds some small evidence of birth control, but attributes the urbanrural differential mainly to later marriage in the towns. Nevertheless, both causes of lower urban
fertility are associated with better education, and other factors, which lead the author to suggest
that the small decline so far is the precursor of a more general fall yet to come.

Frequency and Timing of Intercourse: Its Relation to the Probability of Conception
by Pp. A. LACHENBRUCH.

A new mathematical model, evaluated on a computer. The main variables are a probability
distribution for the day of ovulation, length of fertile period and patterns of intercourse, including
ways of using the rhythm method of control.

Reconstruction of Fertility Trends for the Female Population of the USSR by p. PETER MAZUR.

Owing to lack of data this study is admittedly speculative, but it applies a generation approach
in an attempt to make a more realistic appraisal than can be provided by secular analysis. The
author suggests that cohort fertility is higher in the USSR than in the USA, although secular
variations have been more pronounced in Russia than in America. ‘

Life and Death in the Sixteenth Century in the City of York by URSULA M. COWGILL.
Analysis of the parish records shows that births had a marked seasonal distribution and that

oo the sexes had the same mortality rates. Only about one-half of babies survived the first year
of life.

A Probability Model Applicable to the Study of Inter-Live Birth Intervals and Random Segments of
the Same by L. SRINIVASAN.

This presents the parameters of a simple model derived under a set of realistic assumptions.
It is designed for use in testing the results of sample surveys into fertility. Birth intervals are
considered in two forms: (i) time elapsing between one birth and another, and (ii) number of years
and months between time of latest birth and time of survey.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Fertility Differences in Andean Countries: A Reply to W. H. James by DAVID M. HEER.

Following earlier articles by James and Heer, the author agrees that James’s explanation of
fertility differences between areas of Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador is sound. James attributed the lower
fertility of the Indian-speaking areas than that of the Spanish-speaking areas to altitude. Heer
admits that this is a more valid explanation than some other factors that Heer had mentioned.
