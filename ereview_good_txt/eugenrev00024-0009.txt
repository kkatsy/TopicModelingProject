The Frequency of Illegal Abortion

to come by, but responsible observers

have estimated that there may be between
50,000 and 100,000 abortions illegally procured
in Great Britain every year. For example, Mr
Aleck Bourne? has recently accepted a figure of
about 50,000, while in the last Galton Lecture
Mrs Margaret Pyke? puts it at allegedly 300 a
day, which is 109,500 in a year. An earlier survey
by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Abortion’ in 1939 suggested that there were between
110,000 and 150,000 abortions a year with
40 per cent of them criminal, but Dr Glanville
Williams* thinks this an underestimate and
quotes Professor D. V. Glass® to the effect that
“it seems not at all improbable that there are
each year about 100,000 illegal abortions in
England and Wales”. The American Public
Health Service is recently reported® as estimating
that there may be up to 1,500,000 abortions
induced in the U.S.A. each year.

Revs STATISTICS ARE necessarily hard

A Serious Problem

Criminal abortion is certainly a serious medical
and social problem, but these estimates of its
extent seem to be little more than guesses, and
it is important to discover whether they are
likely to be any where near to the truth. Since
probably only a very few of those responsible
for procuring abortions are ever brought to
trial the figure of about fifty convicted each year
is not really informative, but there is one
statistic which should be objective and relevant,
in the number of maternal deaths recorded as
resulting from procured abortion. The unexpected death of a healthy young woman cannot be
hushed up, and even if it is not the subject of a
Coroner’s inquest it must always be investigated
by some competent medical practitioner who
cannot fail to notice if it is the result of an

abortion, and who should record this as the
cause of death on the death certificate.

In addition to the Registrar General’s Quarterly Returns giving the causes shown for all
deaths registered, the Ministry of Health makes
a more detailed analysis of deaths caused by or
associated with pregnancy and childbirth, and
the results have been published in three Reports
on Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths
in England and Wales’ for 1952-54, 1955-57, and
1958-60. In these, to be referred to below as the
Confidential Enquiries, deaths regarded as due
directly to pregnancy or childbirth are classified
under thirty-three different headings including
three for abortion (with sepsis; with toxaemia
without mention of sepsis; without mention of
either toxaemia or sepsis), with ‘“Procured
Abortion” and “Other Abortions’ shown
separately. Since one death in 1958-60 following
a therapeutic abortion is noted as being included
under “Other Abortions” it is to be presumed
that all the Procured Abortions are believed to
have been illegally procured.

Table I gives some relevant figures extracted
from the Confidential Enquiries reports, and from
the Registrar General’s Quarterly Returns.
This shows that in the three years 1958-60 the
Confidential Enquiries attributed eighty-two
deaths to procured abortion and fifty-three to
other abortions making 135 in all, excluding
cases where abortion occurred or was therapeutically induced in the course of some other
illness, which is then given as the primary cause
of death. This may be compared with 172 deaths
recorded by the Registrar General during the
same period as due to abortion, the corresponding figures for 1955-57 being 141 and 199,
while for 1952-54 they were 153 and 242 respectively. So the coverage of abortion deaths by
the Confidential Enquiries has been progressively

increasing, and it was 78-5 per cent in the latest
report or nearly the same as the 80 per cent
coverage (742 out of 928) for all deaths due to
pregnancy and childbirth. There has clearly been
a remarkable improvement in maternal mortality rates over the past thirty years, from 372
deaths (excluding abortion deaths) per 100,000
live- and still-births in 1928-30 to 95-9 in 1948-50
and 40 in 1958-60, and this is doubtless due to
improved obstetrical practice and especially to
the introduction of new therapeutic agents.
Some 57:5 per cent of the maternal deaths
investigated in 1958-60 were judged to have
been wholly unavoidable, and the patient
herself was primarily responsible in about one
third of the remaining cases which were associated with, though not necessarily caused by,
avoidable factors.

Abortion Death Rates

It is noteworthy also that deaths attributed to
procured abortion are similarly declining, and
they are indeed now remarkably few, if criminal
abortionists are anything like so active as they
are generally supposed to be. In the three years
1958-60, 82 out of 135 abortion deaths covered
by the Confidential Enquiries were attributed to
procured abortion. If the proportion was the
same for the Registrar General’s complete
figure of 172 abortion deaths, that would give
a total of 104 deaths from procured abortion in
the same period. This may well be an under

estimate, if a disproportionate number of procured abortions were missed in the Confidential
Enquiries, but even if all these missing deaths
had resulted from illegal interference, and there
is no evidence that they did, the total for the
three years would only be increased to 141.
If there really are between 50,000 and 100,000
criminal abortions a year as suggested, on these
figures the death rate for them must be somewhere between 35 and 94 per 100,000, and this
should be compared with the mortality among
women whose pregnancies are not improperly
terminated. In 1958-60 there were 928 deaths
classed as due to pregnancy or childbirth, taking
no account of a further 255 deaths associated
with but not directly caused by this condition,
and there were 2,320,121 births, including
stillbirths. Deaths due to abortion, whether procured or otherwise, should be subtracted from
the total since abortions are not included with
the total births, and this leaves 756 deaths,
giving a maternal mortality rate of 32-6 per
100,000 births, including twin births. It would
appear from this that a woman who resorts to
illegal abortion risks at most three times the
chances of death in allowing her baby to be
born in the normal course of events, and if the
higher figure of 100,000 criminal abortions a
year is accepted the risks are considerably less
than double those of normal childbirth which, as
is generally agreed, are now very satisfactorily
low and approaching the medically irreducible
THE FREQUENCY OF

minimum. On this assessment, the mean risk of
death in criminal abortion over England and
Wales as a whole in 1958-60 would have been
little if at all higher than that from normal
childbirth in the two highest of the fifteen
Hospital Regions, with rates above 50 per 100,000,
and it would probably have been lower than the
mean maternal mortality rate of 67-6 ten years
previously, in 1952-54.

A Paradoxical Conclusion

This is such a paradoxical conclusion that the
assumptions upon which it is based ought to
be re-examined. First of all, it does not seem
likely that the Registrar General’s figures for the
total of deaths due to abortion should be seriously wrong. These are based upon death certificates, and although a woman’s own doctor
might very properly give her the benefit of any
possible doubt where illegally procured abortion
is suspected, he is unlikely to want to certify a
death following an abortion as due to some other
cause, and the Registrar General’s Returns do
not distinguish between procured and spontaneous abortions. The Confidential Enquiries
do attempt to make this distinction, and the
possibility of error here must be considered.
Since they miss about 20 per cent of all maternal
deaths, it could be that there was some reluctance
to facilitate the further independent investigation of deaths suspected as having resulted from
criminal interference but not reported as such.
However, if the Registrar General’s figures for
total abortion deaths are accepted, there are only
about a dozen cases a year involved, and the
possibility that these might have to be added to
the deaths from procured abortion has already

been taken into account in calculating the:

maximum estimated death rate.

It seems less likely that there should be any
serious deficiencies in the diagnoses of procured
abortion in cases that are covered by the Confidential Enquiries. These are all reviewed by
independent medical assessors, whose conclusions are confidential and have no legal or other
consequences to the patients (who are dead) nor
to anyone else. And as the assessors are trying to
allocate responsibility for these deaths, they
should surely not hesitate to place the blame on
an abortionist if that were possible, rather than

ILLEGAL ABORTION

on anyone else. In any event, as some 60 per
cent of the abortion deaths investigated were in
fact attributed to procured abortion, even if some
of the others are wrongly classified as spontaneous the numbers involved will hardly be
enough seriously to affect the argument.

Back-street Abortionists

It is of course not impossible that the death rate
in criminal abortion really may be as low as it
appears to be. Procuring an abortion is not a
difficult operation, nor is it dangerous when
skilfully done under proper conditions. But it
is certainly believed that a woman who goes toa
““back-street” abortionist is running very real
risks, and this indeed is an important argument
used in favour of legalizing abortion. Some
professional abortionists are no doubt both
competent and highly qualified, and they have
the strongest motives to take every possible
care, when the death of a single patient brings
ruin. But such well-qualified practitioners are
bound to charge high fees, more than could be
asked in legitimate private practice, which must
be beyond the reach of most of the 50,000 women,
or more, who are said to resort to illegal abortion
every year. There are however thought to be
plenty of other unqualified and more or less
disreputable abortionists available, whose
charges will be more reasonable, with correspondingly greater risks, and Glanville Williams‘
quotes a consultant gynaecologist as estimating
that 90 per cent of illegal abortions “‘are suffered
by women who are prepared to risk their lives
and health in back-street surgery’. The old
woman prodding around with a knitting needle
is perhaps now out of business, but even if
some of these unqualified practitioners are
quite competent they are bound to lack facilities for dealing with emergencies, and they
cannot find it easy to call upon orthodox
medical assistance as soon as it is needed. One
might have expected that the activities of such
people, if they were at all numerous, would have
raised the death rate in criminal abortion by
quite a lot, but that does not appear to have
happened.

An Explanation of the Paradox
The most likely explanation of this paradox is

199
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

surely that the estimate, or rather the guess, of
50,000 — 100,000 abortions a year, upon which
these death rates are based, has been grossiy
exaggerated. If the true figure was 10,000, a
small fraction of the lowest current estimate,
then the death rate in criminal abortion would
be raised to between 350 and, at the most, 470
per 100,000 in 1958-60. This is about the same
as that for normal childbirth in 1928-30, at a
time when many obstetricians still in practice
must already have started on their professional
careers. This figure of 10,000 is only a guess and
it is probably too low, but it may perhaps be
no further from the truth than others five or
ten times higher that are now widely accepted.

Summary
It is widely believed that there may be between
50,000 and 100,000 illegally procured abortions
in Great Britain every year, and that the women
who resort to “back-street’’ abortionists are
running considerable risks to life and health.
However, the number of deaths attributed to
procured abortion in the Ministry of Health’s
Reports on Confidential Enquiries into Maternal

200

Deaths in England and Wales shows that, if
illegal abortion is as common as it is supposed
to be, the risks to life involved cannot be much
more than in normal childbirth, in which the
maternal mortality rate is now regarded as
very satisfactorily low.

It would therefore seem either that the professional competence of criminal abortionists
has been very seriously underrated or else,
and surely more probably, that their numbers
have been much exaggerated.
