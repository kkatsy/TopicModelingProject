THE MEASUREMENT OF DIFFERENTIAL
REPRODUCTION BY PATERNITY RATES

By CHRISTOPHER TIETZE, ™.

Kuczynski and others the calculation

of gross and net reproduction rates
has become a standard method in population
study. In this paper it will be shown how
such rates can be computed for occupational
and social groups.

The gross and net reproduction rate are
both derived from age-specific fertility rates.
This procedure cannot be applied to the
groups above indicated. In several states
legitimate births are registered by the
occupation of their fathers, but the age composition of wives has never at any census
been consistently published according to the
occupation of their husbands. In some cases
this has been done for married women working only in the house, but the age composition
of gainfully occupied women is always
exhibited in connexion with their own
occupation. The English census of IgII is no
exception as It only distinguishes wives below

f | SHANKS to the brilliant work of R. R.

and above 45 years. Such census data would
not be very useful either, for the concentration of unmarried women in certain occupations would make all further calculations
impossible.

It is therefore necessary to take the male
half of the population as the basis for our
work. In some countries the fathers of
legitimate children are given by age groups.
If one relates these figures to the total male
population of the same age, one obtains rates
comparable to the age-specific fertility rates
of females. I propose to call them age-specific

paternity rates. This calculation is illustrated

in Table I by Swedish data for 1930. As no
information at all is available as to the ages
of fathers of children born out of wedlock,
the female and the male part of the table are
both limited to legitimate births.
Age-specific paternity rates can be treated
further in exactly the same way as fertility
rates. They can be added together to give

the total paternity rate and, if only male births
are taken into account, the gross paternity
rate.

As may be seen at a glance this gross
paternity rate differs from the gross reproduction rate of the same country in the same
year, although only legitimate births are
considered in both calculations. There are
three main reasons for this discrepancy :

1. There is an excess of new-born boys
over girls at a fairly constant ratio.

2. The male generation is of greater length
than the female, husbands being on the
average a few years older than their wives.

3. As a result of male emigration and/or
war losses there is a surplus of women in
many European states.

The second and third factors remain
operative also if one calculates the net
paternity rate, for which purpose the male
life table has to be used (see Table II). The
stationary populations in this Table and in
Table V correspond to 1,000 live-born
children of the same sex.

If the numbers of legitimate children born
to men of a certain age group are related not
to the total male population of the same
group but to the number of married men
only, one gets age-specific legitimate paternity
rates. These rates always decline more or

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

less rapidly with advancing age. They will be
needed for the calculations farther on.

Differential Paternity

We may now proceed to the computation
of paternity rates for occupational and social
groups. At first the investigation must be
restricted to legitimate births, but the importance of illegitimacy will be appraised at
the end. If legitimate births were given by
age and occupation of father in combination
the calculation would present no difficulties.
It could be done in exactly the same way as
shown above for the total population of
Sweden. As far as I know such data have up
to now only been published in Czechoslovakia. They will be referred to later. In
all other cases some auxiliary calculations
are necessary. In order to demonstrate my
method as clearly as possible, I select as an
example the occupation of commercial clerks
from the English census and vital statistics
of 1911. The whole procedure is summarized
in Table III.

Columns 1 to 3 need no further explanation. Column 4 contains a series of arbitrarily
selected age-specific legitimate paternity
rates, while column 5 gives the number of
children who would have been born if these
rates had prevailed. The sum of these figures

would have been 18,481. As the observed
number of legitimate births in the occupational group of commercial clerks was only
16,429, the ‘‘ expected” numbers must be
reduced by 11r-r per cent. to yield the
“‘ probable ”’ numbers of column 6.

_ The selection of the’standard of paternity
rates (column 4) is left to the judgment of the
investigator, who will always try to keep the
ratio of observed to expected births in the
neighbourhood of 1:0. In order to do so I
have used in the computations of this paper
three different standards for groups of low,
medium and high fertility: namely the
English series derived from the census
returns of 1921 and Swedish figures of 1921
to 25 and rgor to 10. (For the group of
commercial clerks the first series has been
used.)

Owing to the concentration of births in the
central age groups the question of the standard rate is not as important as one might
imagine. I have tested my results by the
application of different sets of age-specific
legitimate fertility rates and feel convinced
that they cannot be much farther from the
truth than 2 per cent. The choice of a single
uniform standard would have yielded rates
with a slightly broader margin of error—say
6 per cent. This is also corroborated by the
figures from Bohemia, where two sets of total
paternity rates can be computed: one from

It goes without saying that small differences between paternity rates cannot be
regarded as conclusively proven, if they do
not exceed the margin of inaccuracy inherent to the method of computation.

The “probable”? numbers of births in
column 6 are now related to the numbers of
married and unmarried men in column 2 in
order to find the age-specific paternity rates
of column 7, which in their turn are the basis

*It should be remembered that these rates only
represent legitimate births. In Bohemia in 1930 13-1
per cent. of all live births were illegitimate.
104

of the total paternity rate. The rates for the
quinquennial age groups are taken fivefold,
the decennial groups tenfold and the products
added (column 8). The total paternity rate
of the commercial clerks is found to be 2,302.

Gross paternity rates, which take into
account the male births only, are of no
special advantage, as their relation to the
total rates is always approximately the same.
In the case under consideration the gross
paternity rate is 1,174 per 1,000, represented
conventionally by the figure 1-17. This is
51 per cent. of the total rate.

R. R. Kuczynski and others have several
times calculated age-specific fertility rates
from the total number of births with the help
of a series of standard rates. I have now
done the same thing for the male side of the
life table.

The use of total—or gross—paternity
rates is to be preferred to the old method of
relating the legitimate births to the number
of married men below 55 or 50 years for the
following reasons :

1. The relative importance of celibacy is
properly taken into account.

2. The paternity rates are independent of
marriage age, while the other method always
gave too high figures for the late-marrying
groups.

3. International comparison is possible,
which is not always the case otherwise, as
some states use 55 years as the upper age
limit (e.g. England and Wales), and others
50 (e.g. Bavaria).

4. The figures are much more impressive
and easier to grasp in their significance.

As to the necessary data there is no difference, the age distribution of all males and of
married males and the number of legitimate
births being required for every group in both
cases.

It has been stated repeatedly that the
figures under consideration refer only to
legitimate births. They may, therefore, be
used without further adjustment for the
computation of total legitimate paternity rates
of married men. As there are no nuptiality
tables for occupational and social groups, one
has to use the percentage of married,

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

widowed, and divorced men at, say, 60
years as an appropriate measure of the percentage marrying at all during their lives.
If the necessary data are not available, as
is the case with the English censuses, the
percentage of once or oftener married men
may be estimated roughly by increasing the
proportion actually married (not widowed or
divorced) between 45 and 55 years by 10
per cent. There were 29,598 commercial
clerks between 45 and 55 years. The number of married men was 23,991, that is 81-06
per cent. The percentage married once or
oftener was assumed to be 89-17, and the
total legitimate paternity rate of married
men was computed by a simple division :

2,302
I00 X = 2,581
89°17
From the age-specific paternity rates (see
Table III, column 7) net paternity rates can
be computed with the help of the male life
table in exactly the same way as net reproduction rates are computed from agespecific fertility rates. I have, however, not
taken the trouble to construct special life
tables for every occupational and social
group, which would perhaps have been
possible, but contented myself with estimating the necessary values with the help
of the following formula :

A

 

 

a= |
iI — 2M + 2m

(A = males in specified age group in
stationary population, general life table, a =
same for sectional life table, M = infant
mortality of general population, m = infant
mortality of occupational or social group:)

In the case of England and Wales general
infant mortality in I91r amounted to 0-125
per unit. The number of males between 15
and 20 years was 3,980 per 1,000 live-born
boys in a stationary population. Among the
children of commercial clerks infant mortality was 8I per 1,000 or 0-081 perunit. The
number of males in the corresponding age
group of the sectional life table can therefore
be estimated as follows : .

I — 0°250 = 0°162

0:QI2

And so on, through the whole span of life.

This method takes into account not only
the differences of infant mortality, but tries
to consider the whole loss of life before the
reproductive period. It is based on the
assumption that this loss is of an order of
magnitude about twice the infant mortality
rate, which seems to be more or less the case
in civilized countries. It yields of course only
approximate values, but I think the results
are quite good enough. The margin of error
from this source must be quite small in the
large groups of average mortality which form
the bulk of every nation. It increases somewhat at both ends of the social scale, but
remains negligible if compared to the variations of fertility.

The net paternity rate per unit—legitimate births only—of commercial clerks was
therefore 0-93, being 51 per cent. of 1,826.

Iwenty-seven Years Ago

As a first application of the new method I
have calculated total, gross, and net paternity rates and total legitimate paternity rates
of married men for the eight social classes
and a few occupations of the census and
vital statistics of England and Wales in rg1r.
The figures confirm as a whole the results of

105

earlier investigations by showing a strong
negative correlation between social status
and a number of offspring. There are, however, some interesting details. The total and
gross paternity rates of the skilled workmen
(class III) seem to be somewhat higher than
those of class IV and are considerably higher
than among the agricultural labourers (class
VIII). That is due to the fact that the marriage age of class IV is a little higher, while the
men in class VIII both marry much later and
remain single more frequently than in any
other large group. The computation of the
total legitimate paternity rate for married
men makes the superiority of the skilled
workers over the agricultural labourers disappear and reduces substantially the advantage of miners (class VII) over unskilled
workmen (class V). The net rates reveal the
fact that both the upper and middle classes
and the textile workers had already passed
below the replacement line—at least as far
as legitimate children are concerned—whereas miners and unskilled workers were still
increasing at a rate of more than 50 per cent.
in every generation. |

For the professional occupations a further
adjustment had to be made. In this class
there are, of course, no occupied males below
the age of 20; the age group 20 to 25 and to
a lesser degree also the group 25 to 35 are
manifestly under-represented in comparison
with the later stages, the reason being that
many professional men continue their university training until well after their 25th
birthday. As students are as a rule unmarried and have no children, the agespecific paternity rates (column 7) derived
from the crude rates would be too high in the
lower age groups. Therefore the total number of men—occupied plus students—in the
age group 25 to 35 was assumed to be equal
to the number in the next group, and the

TABLE VI
ADJUSTMENT FOR PROFESSIONAL OCCUPATIONS

age group 20 to 25 | age group 25 to 35
Clergymen 291 2,727 3.775 5,453

Physicians 388 3,626 5,101 7,252
106

number between 20 and 25 as being just half
as much.

The effect of this adjustment is to reduce
the crude total, gross, and net paternity rates
by 5 to 16 per cent. The gross rates all drop
below the replacement level. For the first
social class as a whole this adjustment need
not be made because students are included
in this group.

The number of sllegttimate births has always
been very small in England. In 1911 only
37,633 children were born out of wedlock,
against 843,505 legitimate births. The total
and gross paternity rates for the whole
population should therefore be increased by
4°46 per cent., the net rate by about 3-5 per
cent., as the illegitimates had a much higher
infant mortality. Regarding the different
social groups, we may assume that the percentage of illegitimate births was nearly zero
in the upper classes and above average in the
lower strata of society. The social contrast
would therefore be somewhat increased by
the inclusion of illegitimate births.

The margin of inaccuracy, as mentioned
above, is about 2 per cent.; for the professional occupations somewhat more. Barristers and solicitors are combined under the

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

heading ‘‘ lawyers ’’ because I considered the
absolute numbers of birth in each profession
as being too small for separate calculation.
“Farmers "’ include farmers’ sons and other
relatives working on the farm.

This new method of measuring differential
reproduction has one serious drawback which
makes its application in some cases impossible. Master artisans, shopkeepers, etc.,
as a rule marry after having reached economic independence, which mostly happens at
about 30 years. But if such a man sets up a
shop of his own earlier because his father has
died, or by another similar chance, he usually
marries soon afterwards as a wife is a great
help to him in his trade. The proportion of
independent craftsmen, dealers, etc., below
the age of 25 is very small, but a much
greater part of these young men is already
married than is the case in the general
population. The same thing may also be
observed in the next age group, but in a less
pronounced manner. The use of crude agespecific paternity rates for the lower age
groups would therefore yield unduly high
total, gross, and net rates. On the other
hand the application of the adjustment
described above for the professional classes

would reduce the rates too much because in
the trades an unknown, but certainly considerable proportion of young men is married

positions. This difficulty can best be avoided
