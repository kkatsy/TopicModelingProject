THE AGE-STRUCTURE OF OUR POPULATION
By Sir CHARLES ARDEN-CLOSE, K.B.E., C.B, Sc.D., ERS.

and Death, issued by the RegistrarGeneral and published by H.M. Stationery Office in May 1948, there will be found,
packed into a small space, much useful in
|: the pamphlet entitled Matters of Life

formation about the population of England

and Wales. Towards the end of the pamphlet
there is a valuable table giving the populations by five-year age-groups at six different
periods, beginning with 1841 and ending with
1947. The figures refer to the totals of both
males and females for each group, but the
Registrar-General has kindly given me the
separate figures for the two sexes for the
year 1947, and these figures will be found in
the attached table.

The pamphlet shows in graphical form the
percentages (of the whole population) of
children from o to 15, males and females
separately from 15 to 45, and from 45 to 65,
and persons 65 and over. If we take the
working population, men and women, between 15 and 65, it appears that in 1841 this
group accounted for 59:4 per cent of the
whole ; in r1go01 it accounted for 62-9 per
cent ; and in 1947 for 68-3 per cent. But the
most striking feature of the diagrams is the
diminution of the percentage of children—
36-1, 32-4 and 21-2, accompanied by a large
increase in the number of persons 65 years
old and over.

But, as we all know, the diminution in the
proportion of children has been offset by the
fact that they live longer. “‘ For example,
boys born in 1841 could, on average, expect
to survive to the age of 40 and girls to 42;
by Igor these average expectations had increased to 48 and 52, and by 1931 to nearly
59 and 63.” If we were to take the percentages of the whole population of the group
20 to 60, we should find the following: in
1841, 46-7 ; in IQOI, 50°I ; and in 1947, 56-7.
In the latter year, taking the males and
females separately, we get the figures 57-0
for the males and 56:4 for the females.

Recently it has been customary to show the
age-structure of a population graphically, by
means of an “ age-pyramid,” in which each
group, included in a five- or ten-year period,
is represented by a ‘‘step”’ of appropriate
length. Attached will be found such a
“* pyramid,” which is a graphic representation
of the facts provided by the RegistrarGeneral for 1947. The total number of males
is given as 20,917 thousands, and the total
number of females as 22,353 thousands.
There are thus 1-436 millions more women
than men.

A glance at the pyramid will show some
significant facts. There is, so to speak, a
“bite ’’ in the outline between the ages of
5 and 35, which will, of course, continue to
show itself in successive years, a bite due to
past diminished birth rates. But there is also
a really remarkable increase in the group
o to 5, that is, of those born between mid1942 and mid-1947. The boys number 1,813
thousands and the girls 1,723 thousands.

By making use of an appropriate life-table
we can calculate the probable number of survivors of any five-year group after a definite
number of years. The present writer has
thought that it might be instructive to make
such a calculation for the population of
England and Wales, by five-year groups, the
figures for males and females being treated
separately. The period chosen was the ten
years from mid-1947, to enable us to see the
shape of the pyramid for 1957. But there is
one qualification : we do not know what the
birth rates will be during that ten years, and
it is wisest to avoid any speculation on this
point. In consequence, the shape of the 1957
pyramid will not be drawn for the early ages
o to 10 years. After ten years it has a considerable degree of reliability, apart from
changes which may be due to migration or
to war.

If the two sets of figures or the two
pyramids, namely those for 1947 and 1957,

are compared or plotted together, some
interesting facts appear. As regards the totals
of the population of persons ten years old
and older, the male total goes up by 235
thousand, and the female total comes down
by 170 thousand, so that we shall not go far
wrong if we say that the total number of
persons ten years old and over will be much
the same in 1957 as in 1947.

The males 15 to 45 will be diminished in
number by no fewer than 855 thousand, but
the males 45 to 65 will increase in number by
586 thousand.’ Much the same with the
females of those ages; the 15 to 45 group
will come down by 961 thousand, whilst the
45 to 65 group will go up by 298 thousand.
The over-sixty-fives of both sexes show an

increase of nearly a third of a million.
But the children between the ages of 10 and
15 will increase in number by 353 thousand
boys and 316 thousand girls.

Such calculations, and the diagrams based
upon them, take no account of migration,
inward or outward, or of the effect on our
numbers of future wars. But, as to migration and future population tendencies, no
doubt, when the Royal Commission on
Population publishes its report, we shall be
able to study elaborate and far-reaching
investigations. Meanwhile, it is hoped that
this present paper may serve to throw some
light on the alterations in our age-structure
which are likely to take place during the
next few years. °
