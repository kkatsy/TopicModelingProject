SOME ASPECTS OF REPRODUCTION
CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO
EUGENICS.

Introductory.

Though the physiology of the reproductive processes can hardly
be included under the heading of Eugenics in the strict sense, yet, so
far as our knowledge of the reproductive processes can be applied to
the improvement of future generations and to the saving of early
mortality, some consideration of this subject should not be omitted
from a comprehensive system of Eugenics. Whatever its inherent
constitution may be, the conditions under which a new life is started
and primarily developed must be extremely active in modifying or
amplifying the aggregate of its hereditary characteristics. The conditions in which the germ cells are matured and the embryos developed
constitute an environment, and an environment of the most potent kind.
The influence of environment may roughly be said to be inversely proportional to the stage in the life-cycle reached by the individual, and
it follows from this that the early development of the embryo is the
most critical time in life; the time when the mortality is highest, and
when permanently injurious effects are most easily produced. For the
moment we may take for granted the obvious fact, which will be proved
and amplified later, that there are optimum times for reproduction to
take place, and, conversely, that there are times when reproduction
takes place under the very gravest disadvantages. In the first case the
best possible is produced from the germinal constitution of the embryo,
whereas, in the second case, the most superior germinal constitution
may fail to avert disaster. In order, therefore, that the best may be
made of the inherent potentialities of, firstly, the germ cells, and,
secondly, the fertilised ova, it is essential that reproduction shall take
place under physiologically good conditions, and, if possible, under
optimum conditions.
572 EUGENICS REVIEW.

In practice, however, it is found that the time and manner of reproduction are determined by any factor rather than physiological
soundness. Social and economic conditions of the most pressing
description naturally take precedence over abstruse considerations of
which the parents are probably semi-ignorant.

It may, of course, be argued that bad conditions after gestation
will weed out the poorer specimens and will leave the superior ones,
and to that extent be beneficial. It is quite obvious, however, that
mortality during gestation is not selective between good and bad specimens of the race. In many cases the greater size and consequent
greater requirements of a vigorous healthy foetus may be a positive
disadvantage to it, especially at birth. A very young mother or a
very old mother, or a woman with a contracted pelvis, for instance,
will bear an undersized foetus with far greater case than a large one.
Some of our agricultural animals, for instance, have reached the limit
of improvement in certain directions owing to the development of
parts having attained the maximum compatible with normal full
length gestation.

It may be concluded, therefore, that the mortality which goes on
during gestation is one of the rare cases where natural selection does
not operate to improve the race, and that the lower this mortality
can be brought, and the better the conditions under which reproduction takes place can be made, the better the eugenic prospect of the
race.

The Criteria of Reproductive Efficiency.

The whole problem really comes down to the question of the
factors governing reproductive efficiency, and before any consideration
of these can be entered into, it is necessary to have some idea as to what
criteria of efficiency in reproduction may conveniently be used. In
the present paper I propose to consider the question from the point of
view of :â€”

(a) Fertility,
.(b) The amount of pre-natal and infantile mortality,
(c) The size of the child at birth.

These three points cannot be supposed to exhaust the possible ways of
assessing reproductive efficiency, but they cover the main lines of
attack.

It is my object, therefore, to endeavour with the aid of some
clinical data which I have collected, to place before you some
of these aspects of reproduction which are of interest from the standpoint of eugenics.

The Age of the Parents.

The optimum time for reproduction to take place in the life of
the parents may be defined as the period when the most vigorous germ
cells may go to constitute the new individual, and when the mother is
SOME ASPECTS OF REPRODUCTION. 5S

best able to bear the strain of gestation without impairing her future
efficiency or impairing the chance which the foetus has of becoming a
healthy child.

For practical purposes, however, the implications of this definition may be narrowed down considerably. Within reasonable limits
in normal circumstances both ova and spermatozoa are probably thoroughly efficient during the greater part of the reproductive life of the
individual; that is to say, the gametes are fully functional during the
greater part of the period of their production. Itso happens, however,
that in the human female the gonads are mature before the rest of the
body, including the accessory organs of reproduction, and thus the
real limits of the efficient reproductive period are fixed by the conditions.
of the uterus and the secondary organs of reproduction, to which must
be added the condition of the maternal organism generally.

In view of this, therefore, the optimum conditions as they relate
to the germ cells may be dismissed quite briefly. In the human male
the onset of maturity is a gradual process, starting at the age of fourteen or fifteen years, and in the same way the advent of senescent sterility is a gradual process which may start almost any time between the
age of forty-five and fifty-five years, the individual variation being
great. Owing to the fact that during adolescence there are many calls
on the metabolism of the body, and that during the approach of senescence the vitality of the body is waning, the spermatozoa produced
at each extremity of this period of sexual potency are obviously
matured under less favourable conditions than in between, but this
fact alone limits the effectiveness of the spermatozoa at these
times.

It should be remembered, however, that the gonads at this time
have first call on the vitality of the organism, and that if necessary
other parts of the body will be sacrificed to afford the nutrition necessary to meet the strain on the gonads. The result of this is seen in
agricultural practice by the limitation of the amount of stud work
allowed to young sires. Much the same remark applies to the other
end of the reproductive period, and the nett result is that while reproduction by adolescent or senescent males is probably no very great disadvantage to the offspring, such proceedings tend to impair the future
condition of the paternal organism. In agricultural practice the future
of old stud males is of little consequence, and such animals are, therefore, used as long as possible, whereas the amount of the stud work
allowed to young males, especially in the case of valuable pedigree
stock, is carefully regulated.

The case of the maternal organism is rather different. In the
human female the onset of puberty is comparatively sudden, the
tangible sign, namely the beginning of menstruation, being quite
sudden. In the same way the commencement of senescence, the
menopause, is also abrupt when compared with the analogous process
in the male. For these reasons, the reproductive period in the female
is more sharply defined than in the male, but it does not follow that
the female is equally efficient for breeding during the whole of this time.
The actual facts rather point to the contrary. As in the male the
capacity to breed is attained before the organism is fully developed, an
574 | EUGENICS REVIEW.

anomaly which is not confined to human beings. Contrary to the
case of the male, however, the supply of gametes is irrespective of the
demand, and except in the most abnormal circumstances it is hardly
possible to imagine the actual supply of ova running short during
the reproductive period in the life ofthe humanfemale. Asa matter of
fact, since ovulation usually starts about the time of the first menstruation and continues monthly in the absence of pregnancy, intensive
breeding, which of course, greatly curtails ovulation, actually conserves the supply of ova. It is clear, therefore, that as far as the
female is concerned, the question of the supply of ova can have little
importance from the point of view of the optimum time for breeding.
The quality of the ova is a more vexed question, but it is difficult to
believe that the inherent properties of the ova, as distinct from the
conditions of their maturation and other factors constituting environment, can vary much during the life of the individual. The problem
in hand, therefore, must be considered from the viewpoint of the time
of the maximum efficiency of the mother for maturing ova and for pregnancy and nursing.

In the light of this qualification, reproduction during the time
when the organism, though sexually functional, is immature, is obviously to be deprecated. In very few cases can the metabolism of the
mother be equal to supporting both the final development of her own
body and the coincident production of a norrhal healthy foetus. Hence
the result is that one or both of two things happen. Either the maternal
system is depleted, which is the usual event, or else the foetus is malnourished and the resulting child a weakling, while in a large number
of cases both the mother and child suffer. The fact is widely recognised in the agricultural world, and in some cases where it is desired to
keep a sow small this result is obtained by allowing her to breed early.
In any event, however, the least promising are usually killed at birth,
because a young sow will literally wear herself down to skin and bone
in the production and rearing of a large litter. In this connection one
interesting example may be mentioned of the depletion of the mother
on behalf of the foetus or child. Pregnancy and lactation cause a
great drain on the calcium metabolism of even a mature mother, and
in the case of the immature mother whose own calcification is incomplete it is easy to see that either foetus or mother must be neglected.

In spite of this fact, however, it should be noted that prenatal
mortality appears to be very considerably less heavy with young
mothers and with early births than at later stages and parities.*
This remark also applies to still-births, which is rather remarkable,
and, since labour troubles are undoubtedly most common with
young mothers and with early births, argues that the majority of stillbirths are dead when labour sets in, and are, therefore, due to roughly
the same causes as abortions.

It is also to be noted, however, that while too early breeding is to
be deprecated, too long delayed maternity is even more unfavourable
to both mother and offspring. Certain fairly well defined changes seem

* A convenient obstetric expression for the number of the pregnancy .
SOME ASPECTS OF REPRODUCTION. 575

to appear in the female if unmarried when maturity is fully established.

I am not referring here to the psychological peculiarities which
are characteristic of the unmarried female adult, and which are quite
marked*, but to the even more marked physical changes. These
changes affect the whole of the organism, and lead to a gradual decay
of physical vitality. This rather curious result no doubt has its foundation in the inhibition of a natural function and it is no doubt connected with the fact that, notwithstanding the dangers of maternity,
married females over 30 vears of age have been said to have a lower
death rate than unmarried ones of the same age (Stark)f.

As the following quotation from Marshall shows, maternity
has, in fact, a most subtle effect on the whole female organism :â€”â€˜ â€œThe
beginning of gestation is marked by a change in the character of the
mother. The pregnant cow and sheep â€˜â€œâ€˜settleâ€™â€™ or tend to fatten in
the early months, and graziers take advantage of this fact to get the
animal into good condition for market. Mares which were previously
troublesome and difficult to work become quiet and tractable.â€™â€™ Animals may occasionally be saved from becoming â€˜â€˜screwsâ€™â€™ by breeding,
and I call to mind very distinctly how in one case which came under
my obse vation.a miserable unhealthy rat was literally transformed into quite a sound doe by becoming pregnant. In ordinary
cases, therefore, pregnancy may be said to have physiologically
beneficial results on the maternal organism, and such results are
obviously lacking in the absence of pregnancy.

I wish here, however, to speak more particularly of the effect of
delaying maternity in married life. Though the general retrogressive changes which characterise celibacy in the female do not
usually appear in the childless married female, a certain amount of
degeneration, which is disadvantageous from the point of view of
efficient gestation, appears to take place in the secondary organs or
reproduction. The most serious result of delay of maternity from the
present point of view is probably loss of elasticity of the uterus and
vagina, and the consequent decreased capacity for pregnancy.

It is quite clear, therefore, that the optimum time for pregnancy
is quite early in the reproductive life of the female, and this conclusion
is confirmed and accentuated by the progressive tendency to sterility
which coincides with increasing age of the female. Duncan
studied this question by considering the percentage of mothers married

 

* These changes consequent upon sex inhibition are perfectly well-known
psychological phenomena. The outward manifestations often take the form of
contempt or dread of all things connected with sex. Jones says that one out of
three unmarried adult females are definitely abnormal. These phenomena are
prevented by reasonably early marriage even in the absence of maternity and
it is clearly desirable that marriage should take place before sex inhibition has
proceeded to an extent sufficient to produce those changes which constitute what
may be called psychological sterility.

Â¢ It has, however, been pointed out that this higher death-rate of unmarried
females over thirty may be mainly or wholly caused by the fact that many women
remain single owing to ill-health, and by the fact that many of the unmarried women
earn their own living and are, therefore , subjected to greater casual dangers than are
married women. I am indebted to Prof. Pearson, F.R.S., for criticism of this
point.

From these and other similar data Duncan concludes :â€”

â€˜â€˜1, That the initial fecundity of women gradually waxes to a
climax, and then gradually wanes.

2. That the initial fecundity is very high from 20-34 years of

age of twenty-five.â€™â€™*

Duncan also approaches the same problem in another way, namely,
by considerations of the percentage of women married at each age who.

These data show very well that with the exception of women
married under twenty years of age, women who will have children at
all usually have the first one within two years of marriage.

Duncan also shows that this law of decreasing fertility of the
mother applies, though with less force, to women who start bearing
children early.

The next method of approaching the question of the efficiency for
maternity of mothers of different ages consists in considering the
amount of mortality of offspring attending pregnancies at different
ages.* My own data relative to first births works out as follows :â€”

In connection with this table two things must be borne in mind.
First, that the real amount of pre-natal mortality is quite unassessable
owing to the great amount occurring in the first three months of pregnancy without any indication of the true state of affairs. This early
mortality, which results only in absorption of the foetuses or
profuse menstruation, has been calculated by Pearson to amount
to more than all the rest of uterine mortality. Secondly, the percentage of still-births, on the other hand, is high, but in both cases it
may be assumed that the distribution according to the age of the mother
is significant, and we may conclude, therefore, that the mortality
accompanying primiparity is greatly increased when the age of the
mother is advanced. Duncan found the same distribution to hold good
for mortality of the mothers themselves during or just after labour.

It has been suggested that a tendency to abortion may be inherited, and any such tendency would, of course, impose very severe restrictions on the fertility of the strain of people in question, and the possibility, therefore, merits a word or two. It is obvious that complete
sterility is about the one characteristic that cannot be inherited, and
a priort, it does not seem likely that any feature which tended towards
partial sterility would be inherited for long under natural conditions.
It is possible, however, that such a characteristic could be supported
for some generations under the artificial conditions in which the human
subject now lives, owing to the fact that functional semi-sterility
might have no more effect in limiting the number of offspring than the
voluntary semi-sterility which is widely prevalent among certain
classes of the population. Various slight malformations of the female
reproductive organs, which are no doubt inherited like other physical
peculiarities, might be one source of an inherited tendency to abortion.

robably the most frequent cause of a tendency to an excessive amount
of abortion being passed from one generation to another is not a case of
* This system of age groups has two definite advantages as compared with the
arrangement used by Duncan in the table quoted above. Firstly, the groups
represent to a greater extent natural periods in the life of the mother, the 13-17 years
of age group, for instance, represents females definitely immature though sexually
functional. Secondly, mis-statements of age are neutralised to a large extent by
having the groups centring round the fives and tens. A woman, for instance, of
â€˜thirty-one will often give her age as twenty-nine, while a girl of nineteen will pro
bably say twenty. On the system here adopted such mis-statements will not alter
the group to which the women belonged, while in Duncanâ€™s system they would.
SOME ASPECTS OF REPRODUCTION. 579
true inheritance at all, but is simply the handing on from mother to
foetus of certain diseases.

This point about mortality may be extended to infantile mortality.
Deaths during the first two or three years of life must be largely determined by poor nursing, of which the most vital factor is inferior lactation on the part of the mother. This applies especially to the poorer
classes, who, when all is considered, form the bulk of the population.
Though data apparently are lacking it may safely be assumed that the
capacity of the female for lactation reaches a maximum at the prime of
maturity, that is to say, is not fully developed until the maternal body
is fully mature, and will decrease towards the menopause. In the
cow, the only animal with data available, this is certainly so, the heaviest lactation period following the third or fourth pregnancy (cows are
usually bred from before being fully mature). On these grounds it
would be supposed that the children of very young and very old
mothers would show a high mortality rate, not only during the first
year of the actual inferior suckling, but also during the following years
before the evil effect wears off, if it ever does. In any case from this
or other causes very early pregnancy is mentioned by Farr as one
of the causes of excessive infantile mortality. This question of the
capacity for lactation is of immense importance from a eugenical
standpoint owing to the probable inheritance of defects in this particular, which would result in an inherited infantile mortality. Here
again, while human data are lacking, reference may be made to what is
found in domestic animals. In the case of the cow, there is every
reason to suppose that the capacity for good lactation is strongly
inherited ; in fact, the whole system of organisation of dairy breeding
is based on the probability that the capacity or incapacity of the
mother for lactation will be at least partially inherited. In cattle
the good milking quality is inherited from mother to grand-daughter
through a male, just as much as direct from mother to daughter. In
the case of any inherited defect in lactation it would be essential that
the time of reproduction should be chosen with care to avoid bad results.

Finally, the relative efficiency for pregnancy of the female at
different ages may be considered according to the size and weight at
birth of the resulting offspring. Duncanâ€™s figures on this point are as

follows :â€” Table IV.

580 EUGENICS REVIEW.

On this criterion a very definite period of maximum reproductive
vitality is exhibited between 20-30 years of age.

- A further problem of eugenic importance relating to the age of the
mother is this. The increasing size of the cranium in the human race
is, according to Dutton, not being paralleled by a corresponding
increase in the size of the pelvis, with the result that parturition is
becoming more and more difficult. Where exactly this will lead to
eventually it is difficult to see, and even at the moment this fact,
taken in conjunction with a second, that cranial ossification is more
advanced in the male foetus than in the female, means that the males
suffer more at parturition. This is one of the factors causing the very
high sex-ratio of still-births, which nearly all authors agree to be just
over 130 males per 100 females. In the present state of excess of females at marriageable age this loss of males can be ill-afforded. From
this point of view it is essential that the first pregnancy should be
entered upon before the cartilages which control the elasticity of the
pelvis have hardened.

The conclusions so far arrived at may be summed up at this point
by saying that the satisfactory development of the child is more
directly dependent on the mother than on-the father (if certain diseases.
of the male be omitted) and that the female seems best able to provide
the conditions essential for satisfactory gestation during the early
years of her full maturity, i.e. about twenty-three to thirty years of
age.

In the light of this general conclusion, a word may be said about
the eugenic aspect of late marriages and contraception. It is clear
that the delay of marriages in the female much beyond the age of thirty
is in most cases, highly dysgenic, from both a psychological and physiological standpoint. The cases, however, of reasonably early marriage
made voluntarily sterile during the early years by the use of contraceptives is rather different, and it is most difficult to estimate the
physiological importance of contraception*.

One thing, however, iscertain. The worst features of the physicak
and psychological deterioration which results from celibacy in the
female are avoided by marriage even if the union is made voluntarily
sterile by contraceptives. At the same time, however, some of the
factors which tend to progressively incapacitate the ageing female for
pregnancy still operate, and to this extent the postponement of childbearing is unsatisfactory. If, however, child-bearing is for economic
or other reasons impossible during the early years of maturity, sterile
marriage is, on a phsyiological basis, infinitely more to be recommended than celibacy as a means of tiding over these years.

Size of Family and Interval between Births.

Having discussed the factors which influence the time at which the
rearing of a family should preferably begin, the interval between births.
and the size of family may be briefly considered.

* No reference is intended here to the injurious or other action of the actual
contraceptives themselves. The point at issue is the effect of contraception as.
postponing pregnancy to more advanced ages of the mother.
SOME ASPECTS OF REPRODUCTION. 581

Parturition is usually succeeded by a period of amenorrhea, but
the exact duration of this condition is subject to much variation. In
fact the view has been expressed by Heil and Fordyce _ that
menstruation, not amenorrhea, is the normal occurrence during lactation. In the vast majority of cases menstruation restarts within
twelve months of parturition. Absence of menstruation, however, does
not necessarily imply impossibility of becoming pregnant, and the
length of suckling has certainly little or no connection with the time of
the restarting of the menstrual cycle. The practice of unduly prolonging suckling in the hope of securing immunity from conception is a
fallacy of the worst description, and is most severely to be deprecated
as being injurious to both mother and child.

It is therefore clear that the natural unavoidable interval between
births is very small, and the real question of the interval between
births comes down to the individual economic factor and the physiological optimum, of which the latter alone can be dealt with here. It may,
I think, be laid down as a generalisation that a mother should never
have to bear the double strain of lactation and gestation at one and the
same time, that is to say, a second pregnancy should never be entered
upon until the suckling of the previous child is entirely finished. Two
gestations and a period of lactation in two years would place a serious
strain on any woman not of exceptional physique. The shortest interval
between two consecutive births should be two years, a time allowing a
full year for lactation and a slight rest between the end of this period
and the beginning of the next pregnancy. It should be remembered
that a child is in many ways a considerable strain on the mother even
after the termination of the suckling period, especially in the absence
of adequate assistance in domestic routine, and it should be emphasised
that two yearsâ€™ interval between births is the minimum time compatible with sound common sense. Associated with this question also, is
the point regarding the time which should elapse between marriage and
the first birth. Most authors are agreed that time should be allowed
for the female organism to adapt itself to the new conditions of life
before a pregnancy is embarked upon, a view strongly supported by
Stopes in a recent work.

The limit at the other extreme, i.e., the maximum time which
should be allowed to elapse between births, is not so easy to arrive at,
but extremely long intervals are to be deprecated. It is hard to conceive of anyone recommending ten or fifteen years interval, and five or
six years is probably the maximum compatible with efficiency.

In view of these theoretical and practical considerations it is of
interest to observe what actually happens. Duncanâ€™s figures
relating to 1855-7 showed that 14.0 per cent. of married women bore
a child within the first year of married life, and 71.33 within two years
of marriage, and that in each case the percentage was highest for
mothers between twenty and twenty-four years of age, a finding which
suggests immediately that women of this age conceive most readily.

The total data of this author showed an average period of only
19.9 months between successive births, but it must be remembered that
in 1855-7 families as a rule were larger than to-day, and, while the
undesirable portions of the community are no doubt reproducing them582 EUGENICS REVIEW.

selves as fast as a birth every twenty months and even faster, the
desirable portion allows a much longer interval than this between
births.

In my own data, given in Table VI, the difference between the
mean age of 1-para and 2-para mothers is 2.1 years, and the difference for 2-para and 3-para mothers is 2.3 years. The difference
in the mean ages of later parities is, however, less than this. Being
Hospital data, these figures will relate to a not very high social class.

The interval between births leads automatically to a consideration
of the size of family, a subject of the very greatest importance to all
interested in eugenics. We have now reached the deplorable state of
affairs where the largest families are produced by those least qualified
to do so; and in view of the consequent efforts being made to persuade
the fit to increase the size of their families, some consideration of the
physiological aspects of the size of families is not out of place.

In the first place attention may be called to the variety of social
conditions which tend to influence the size of family in certain classes.
A good illustration of the uncertainty of the factors concerned is to be
found in some work done by the present writer on Burkeâ€™s Peerage.

The monstrous excess of males in families of two and three cannot
be explained on any physiological grounds, nor can the excess of
females in families of eight, considering the excess of males in the
average ratio. The explanation of these aberrant results lies, very
probably, in the aristocratic desire to leave a male heir. From this
point of view a family of two males or three males would be quite satisfactory, and would, therefore, probably not be added to, while a family
of two or three girls, would be most unsatisfactory, and would, therefore, be added to in the hope of producing a boy. In this way families
starting off with a succession of boys would be usually small families,
while families starting with girls would usually become large. Hence
the result is produced that small families havea great excess of males,
and large families an excess of females. Actually, inthe data analysed,
117 families were found with two males only, and twenty-five with two
SOME ASPECTS OF REPRODUCTION. 583

females only, while fifty-one families consisting of three males were
found as against eight only of three females. This explanation may
seem exaggerated, but there is no doubt that in years gone by the
desire to leave a male heir and the comparative indifference to a female
child has been a very potent factor in many ways*. Iam, however,
endeavouring to clinch the point by a further analysis of the data.

Whatever may be the social and economic factors which have effect
upon the size of family, however, it may be worth while to briefly
touch on the physiological aspects. On the basis of the two years
minimum interval between births discussed above, and placing the
efficient reproductive life of the female at sixteen years, there is reasonable time for eight children, as large a family, for even the fittest
people, as the most enthusiastic eugenist would suggest. In fact regular families of half this size, after allowing for non-marriages, would
result in a considerable yearly increase in the population. The actual
problem, however, is hardly so simple. Not every birth results in an
adult, and still less does every conception result in a birth. Very few
mothers get through motherhood without a mishap of some sort to at
least one pregnancy, and infantile mortality takes a considerable toll
of the individuals surviving until birth. It may be said, then, in
general, that a womian who has reared five children to puberty has
approached, if not actually reached, the physiological limit compatible
with safety. Food for reflection is certainly supplied by the children
in excess of this number produced by people who would be better sterile,
and the families smaller than this produced by those most fit for parenthood.

The Correlation between the Age of Mother and the Parity.

Various authors have considered various aspects of reproduction as
related to the age of the mother and as related to the parity. It is
clear, however, that there is a casual connection between the age of the
mother and the number of the pregnancy. First births may be scattered throughout the reproductive period but they are, of course,
largely concentrated round early maturity.

My own statistics show that about two-thirds of the primiparae
are under twenty-seven years of age. Second and third births are concentrated between the ages of twenty-three and twenty-seven, fourth
and fifth births between twenty-eight and thirty-two, sixth and
seventh births between twenty-eight and thirty-seven, while eighth
and further births very largely take place after thirty-eight.

The possibility thus arises that influence due to parity might appear
also as influence by the age of the mother, and that any result produced
by the age of the mother would also appear as a result of parity. For
this reason specially, and as a study in reproduction generally, the
exact relation between the age of the mother and the parity is of interest.
The following table shows the correlation between age of mother and
parity in the 10,043 pregnancies which comprise my data :â€”

* In this connection it is hard to avoid recalling to mind the national and
international disturbance caused by this same passion in the case of Henry VIII.
and the late Tsar Nicholas of Russia.

It will be seen that the mean interval between first and second, and
second and third births, is a little over two years, while between later
births this interval decreases, a finding which confirms Duncanâ€™s conclusions. |

It will also be seen that there is considerable correlation between
the age of mother and the parity. The following frequency surface
illustrates the distribution of total pregnancies according to age of
mother and parity (See Fig. it).

Pre-natal Mortality according to Age of Mother and Parity.

Having established this high correlation, we may now consider

It will be seen that the correlation between the age of the mother
is equally well shown for total pregnancies, live-births, still-births,
and abortions.

The chief points of interest in these tables, however, can only be
brought out by calculating each type of pregnancy (abortions, stillbirths, and live-births) as percentages of the totals. In this way the
relative frequency of each type may be seen, and consequently some
very interesting light is thrown on the efficiency for pregnancy at
various ages :â€”

SOME ASPECTS OF REPRODUCTION. 587

This table shows at a glance that the mean percentage of abortions
increases both with age of mother and with parity in a regular manner;
the solitary exception being the slight decrease from parity 5-6-7 to
parity 8+. In view, however, of the high correlation between the
age of mother and parity, this result would be brought about if only
one of these two factors influenced the amount of abortion. For instance, the low abortion percentage of the large number of births
occurring in age group 18-22 will cause a low total abortion percentage
for the group, whatever the percentage at the other parities in this age
group may be. _It is possible, however, to overcome this difficulty:
If the age of the mother alone influenced the amount of abortion, there
should be variation from one age group to another, but little variation
between the different parities of the same age of mother group. That is
to say, as the table stands, variation from top to bottom of the vertical
arrays, but little variation from left to right in the horizontal arrays.
If, however, the parity carried the weight, variation would be in the
rows and not in the columns. In this particular table, the constant
tend of variation of percentages is from one parity column to the next,
whilst there is little from row to row, i.e. from one age of mother
group to the next. This fact suggests that, excepting first births, the
parity is the controlling factor in abortion, and not the age ofthe
mother. This may be brought out by taking the average of the percent ages in the rows and the average of the percentages in the columns. By
doing so, no account is taken of the actual number of births in the
groups, and hence the complication due to the correlation shown in
Table VI is avoided. These averages are most interesting. For the
age of mother groups there is little variation and no constant tendency
whatever, while for the parity groups the average rises continuously
from 6.6 for parity 1, to 33.0 for parities 5-6-7, and then sinks
slightly. On this evidence, therefore, the amount certainly depends
more on the parity than on the age of mother.

In the case of still-births (Table XI.), however, the matter seems to
be different. Here again the mean percentage rises both with parity and
age, but again this tells us nothing about the relative influence of
these two factors. Table XI, however, shows that the most constant
tend of variation is in the columns, not in the rows, a supposition confirmed by the averages, which show no definite tendency for the parity
groups, but which in the case of the age of mother groups rise steadily
from 8.7 for 18-22 years of age to 23.9 for 38-42 years of age. This
finding suggests very strongly that the age of mother controls the
amount of still-births. The somewhat remarkable conclusion is
reached, therefore, that the parity controls the amount of abortion and
the age of the mother the amount of still-birth.

This hypothesis (in the absence of further data the argument can
only be regarded as a hypothesis) is very much what might be expected
from a physiological standpoint. Early pre-natal mortality must be
largely due to initial incapacity of the uterus to function properly*,
while the increased rigidity of the organs consequent upon ageing of
the mother will affect to a great extent larger, and, therefore, older
foetuses. This is well illustrated in the case of first births, where
abortions show no very great increase between 18 and 42, while stillbirths rise from 8.1 per cent. to 32.7.

Turning to the live-births percentages, which are, of course, functions of the abortion and still-birth percentages, the results are much
as would be expected.

* There is good reason to believe that the ordinary distribution of pre-natal
mortality found is hardly influenced by disease. In the case of syphilitic infection ,
for instance, a series of abortions is usually followed by still-birth and finally by a
live-birth, owing to increased toleration of the toxin. This is just the opposite to
the ordinary distribution.
SOME ASPECTS OF REPRODUCTION. 589

Owing to the fact that both the age of the mother and the parity
have contributed to controlling the amount of previous mortality it
would be expected that the percentage of live-births would show diminution in both directions. Table XII shows that this actually
occurs, definite trends of variation occurring in both the rows and the
columns, and also in both sets of average percentages. The mean percentages, which give the true total percentage of live-births in age
groups and parity groups are graphed below (See Figs. HII. andIV.)

Table XII shows well the remarkable variation in the chances an
embryo has of becoming a live child. For a first pregnancy of a
mother of eighteen to twenty-two years of age the chances are approximately 88 to 12 in favour, while for an eighth or higher pregnancy ofa
mother of thirty-eight to forty-two years of age the chances are roughly
only 45 to 55, or less than even. For the whole set of observations the
chances are 7 to 3 in favour, which agrees quite well with the observations of other writers.

â€˜The Sex Proportions of Live and Still-births according to the
Age of the Mother and the Parity.

To complete the account of the data obtained from the Records of
St. Maryâ€™s Hospital, the sex proportions of the live and still-births at
the different ages of the mother and at the different parities may be
given. The distribution of the sexes among the abortions would have
been of greater interest than either, but unfortunately this particular
item was not recorded at the Hospital. Much of interest can, however,
be gathered from the other data which I was able to obtain, and which
are given here. Tables XIII and XIV give for live-births and stillbirths respectively, the numbers of the sexes and the consequent proportions of males, where the number are sufficient at each age-parity

group.

In these two tables the three numbers in each group give, respect tively, the number of males, the number of females, and the percentage
of males. *

From these two tables the following observations may be made:â€”

That the proportion of males decreases continuously with advanc
 

*Of the three main ways of expressing the proportions of the sexes, I was
originally inclined to favour the calculation of the number of males per 100 females,
as is at present, and has for some time, been used in practically all biological
papers. This method, however, has the disadvantage that no trustworthy probable error of the ratio can be obtained. For this reason the ratios are here expressed as percentages of males, the probable error can be calculated from
the formula

SOME ASPECTS OF REPRODUCTION. 5938

ing age of the mother, a finding quite in keeping with the work of other
writers, while the proportion shows no definite tendency as
regards parity. Other workers, however, have shown that the proportion of males usually falls in the later pregnancies. The correlation
which has been found to exist between the age of the mother and the
number of pregnancy would obscure the single action of either of these
factors, as was the case with the incidence of still-births and abortions.
In the case of the sex-ratio, also, the proportions of the individual
parity-age groups are too erratic to admit of analysis to determine the
relative importance of the age of the mother and the parity as influencing the proportion of males. Such a result, however, is not unexpected. As shown elsewhere both the amount of abortion and the
amount of still-birth influence the sex-ratio of live-births, and, if, as
appears from the data given above, the parity and the age of the mother
are respectively of chief importance in determining the amount of these,
the actual factors controlling the sex proportions of live-births must be
somewhat complex, and the results correspondingly difficult to analyse.

(b) The percentage of males among still-births is 57.1, that is to
say, that males are in the ratio of 133 per 100 females, a ratio which
agrees perfectly with the results obtained by many other observers.
As in the case of the live-births, the proportion of males falls with
advancing age of the mother, a finding which can be accounted for
physiologically in the following manner. Still-births are obviously
of two types, those dead when parturition sets in, and, therefore, com
parable to abortions, and those which are killed during labour. Of
the two the former are probably the most numerous, but the excess is
probably least in young mothers, who, as a class have the most difficult
labours. Also, though both types have an excess of males, mortality
during labour has the greater excess, and, hence, as this decreases in
total amount, so will the excess of males among still-births slightly
decrease.

The Effect of Season on Reproduction.

The best time for reproduction to take place in the reproductive
period of the parents has now been discussed from the standpoint of
various criteria of efficiency in reproduction, and the time of the year at
which gestation is best entered upon may be briefly discussed.

I know of no data relative to any seasonal variation in the amount
of abortion, but a certain amount exists relative to seasonal variation in
the amount of still-births. Dusing originally postulated a small
variation, the percentage of still-births being least for conceptions
in October, November, and December, and highest for April conceptions. Even so, however, the variation was less than 1 per cent., and
extensive observations of American workers have given Dusingâ€™s
figures no confirmation. There are also theoretical reasons for supposing that the amount of pre-natal mortality does not vary greatly
during the year, and this, therefore, may be a tentative conclusion.

 

*Nicholls, for instance, in a giant investigation upon the entire records
available in the world, found a sex-ratio of 131-6 males per 100 females among
still-births.
594 EUGENICS REVIEW.

The question of seasonal fertility in the human race provides a most
intriguing problem. At the present time only the slightest seasonal
variation occurs in the birth-rate in civilised countries, but there is
nevertheless some reason to suppose that man originally had a primitive
breeding season. The evidence in favour of this is fourfold :â€”

(a) some aboriginal tribes at the present day have a restricted
breeding season,

(b) our present May Queen festivals are vestigial survivals of
ancient feasts which probably marked the time of general
marriage in tribes,

(c) some civilised countries do have a fairly marked seasonal
variation in the birth-rate, the time of highest rate
corresponding to conceptions in the spring,

(d) in certain tribes, the genital organs become absolutely
quiescent at certain times. The Esquimaux, for
instance, do not menstruate through the winter.

At the present time, however, in this and other European countries
there is little evidence of seasonal variation in fertility, and in
general it may be said that the evidence relating to seasonal variation
in reproductive efficiency is slight.

One last point may be mentioned. The account of the work of
Tornier, recently given to the Society by Prof. MacBride, strongly
suggests that the environment of the embryo, and in partic ilar the fluids
surrounding it, can determine the formation of abnormalities, whether
or not such productions are inherited. The application of this work to
mammalian reproduction is obvious, but none the less important.
The fertilised egg undergoes early development quite free in the fluids
contained in the lumen of the Fallopian tubes and uterus. Ina number
of lower mammals it has been shown that the fluids of the female genital
organs undergo great change during the oestrous cycle, and though less
known, the changes in the physical state of the interior of the genital
organs of the human female are obviously greater. It is not inconceivable, therefore, that the time of impregnation relative to the
menstrual cycle in the human subject may have some connection with
the production of abnormalities. The production of monstrosities in
man is probably more common than is thought, the vast majority of
such foetuses being eliminated at a very early stage in gestation.

Conclusion. |

think, be safely concluded that the times at which, and the conditions
under which, reproduction takes place have a considerable influence on
the prospects of the new individual being mentally and physically fit,
and that they have, therefore, a eugenic bearing. This being so, it is
no exaggeration to say that eugenic propaganda and eugenic education can scarcely claim to be comprehensive in the absence of any consideration of what is known regarding the conditions most favourable
to reproduction. | :
