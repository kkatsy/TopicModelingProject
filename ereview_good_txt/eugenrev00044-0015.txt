HOME BACKGROUND AND. SELECTION
FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION’
By F. M. MARTIN, PH.D.

HE year 1902 saw the establishment
in this country of a public system of
secondary education. The principal
basis of the new system was provided by the
old endowed grammar schools, and its aims
and methods were heavily influenced by
those of the public schools. For nearly half a
century thereafter, “ equality of educational
opportunity ’”’ was generally to be taken to
mean that access to the secondary schools
should be available to children of the
requisite ability without regard to social
origins or parental means. Competition for
secondary school places was always severe,
not primarily as a consequence of any
widespread public appreciation of the
scholarly virtues of the secondary tradition,
but rather because of a keen awareness on
the part of the parents of the social value of
a secondary education. The expanding
occupations of the ‘‘ new ’’ middle class were
the main goal of those many parents who
hoped to see their children settled in
employment which, if not highly remunerative, did at least offer a measure of security,
and to these the secondary school seemed to
provide the only direct route.

Education and Social Mobility

Recent research has shown clearly that the
parents who attached so much importance to
a grammar school education, and were in so
many cases prepared to make substantial
financial sacrifices rather than send their
children to, say, the junior technical school,
had in fact an accurate sense of the
distribution of occupational opportunity. It
has been clearly demonstrated! that occupa
tional prospects were, in the years between |

the wars, extremely closely linked to success
or failure in acquiring a secondary school
education. For the working-class child it
provided the most reliable means of upward
social mobility, while the middle-class child,
if he did not improve his occupational level
relative to that of his father, at least acquired
a substantial measure of immunity against
the risk of social relegation. Further education reinforced the effects of secondary
education but did not provide a substitute
for it.

In spite of a steadily growing provision of
secondary school places and of the increasing
proportion of such places available to
competition, it became obvious fairly early
in the development of the public secondary
system that a child’s chances of reaching a
secondary school varied substantially according to his social origins. Marked differences
in examination results between elementary
schools of varying social composition were
frequently commented upon by H.M. Inspectors between 1922 and 1939. It was shown,
too, that these social class differences were
not a mere reflection of differences in
intellectual composition. Kenneth Lindsay?
pointed out that working-class parents not
infrequently refused to accept secondary
school places which had been offered to their
children; John Gray and Pearl Moshinsky®
showed that many middle-class children who
attended secondary schools fell below a
postulated minimum level of ability, while
by the same criterion the lower social groups
were grossly under-represented; Leybourne
and White! assessed the direct and indirect
cost to parents of a secondary school
education; and Ruth Glass® indicated the
existence of a high correlation between the
success rates of elementary schools and the
level of their material environment. |

The Aims of this Inguiry .

The present inquiry, although it followed
directly from the national investigations
reported in Social Mobility in Britain, also has
affinities with these earlier studies. It was
carried out by a group of research workers,
whose senior member was Mrs. Jean Floud,
and was generously supported by the London
School of Economics and Political Science.
It took the form of a pair of local studies
whose immediate aim was to illustrate the
social and cultural factors at work in the
process of selection for secondary education
and their influence on the subsequent
achievements of children both in school and
on leaving. It attempted also to assess the
effect on the distribution of educational
opportunity of post-war legislation and
social change, by measuring the extent to
which the social composition of the secondary
schools had changed over time, and the
degree in which, if at all, children of the
requisite level of intellectual ability were
still effectively denied access to the grammar
schools as a consequence of their social
origins. That ‘ educational opportunity ”’
was defined in terms of access to the
secondary grammar schools, and “ ability ”’
in terms of intelligence test performance,
does not imply any lack of realization of the
limitations of such an approach, and I hope
to comment on some of these limitations at a
later stage. Its justification was the need to
document the extent of the post-war educational revolution in the terms in which
reform had been demanded in the pre-war
years.

Areas Studied

The two areas selected for study were
Middlesbrough, in the North Riding of
Yorkshire, and the Educational Division of
South-West Hertfordshire,* which in terms
both of social structure and of educational
provision may be regarded as reasonably
representative of conditions in the north and

south of England respectively. Our information as to the social origins of secondary
school entrants was obtained, as far as
pre-war years were concerned, from school
admission registers; by direct inquiry in
writing of the parents of children now in
attendance at the grammar schools; and by
interview{ with the parents of children who
at the time of our inquiry were in their last
year at a primary school or its equivalent,
and were candidates for selection for secondary education. Both the second and third
method of inquiry produced information
relating to a wide range of features of the
child’s family environment, and I shall
discuss some of the results of the interviews
in rather more detail.

The two districts differ markedly from one
another in their social composition and their
industrial structure. The general pattern of
social class differences is clearly indicated by
the Report of the 1951 Census.

In Middlesbrough, with its dependence on
heavy industry, the great majority of the
population are manual workers, a high
proportion of them unskilled or general
labourers. Although at present enjoying full
employment and a fair measure of prosperity,
Middlesbrough has vivid memories of largescale distress and unemployment in the
years between the wars. Its population,
geographically relatively stable, includes a
substantial Catholic minority. In SouthWest Hertfordshire, by contrast, the nonmanual occupations are rather better represented than in the country as a whole. Its
manual working class, in which skilled
workers easily predominate, is diverse in its
recent geographical origins and it has a trend
of steady economic expansion as a background to its present prosperity.

the entire age-group were approached.
-_. HOME BACKGROUND AND SELECTION FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION 197

Provision for secondary education has
developed on rather different lines in the two
areas. In the Watford Grammar Schools, the
proportion of places available to competition
never exceeded one-third before the passage
of the 1944 Education Act; the corresponding
proportion in Middlesbrough was_ threequarters. The Watford Grammar Schools
were therefore to a much greater extent the
preserve of the middle and lower middle
classes, and the impact of the Education Act
was substantially greater. However, in both
areas the abolition of fees in 1945 led to a
marked increase in the representation of
working-class children in the grammar
schools; but even under conditions of full
competition the chances of gaining access to
a grammar school vary considerably from
one social class to another. This is clearly
indicated by the social, analysis of examination results shown in Table I.

Primarily as a result of the larger provision
of grammar school places, the success rate of
manual workers’ children is higher in
South-West Hertfordshire, where just over
one in seven of the working-class children
reaches the grammar school, than in Middlesbrough, where the corresponding proportion
is slightly less than one in eight. The
chances of working-class children in SouthWest Hertfordshire are probably also
increased to a slight extent by the incomplete participation in the entrance examination of the children of business and professional people, who are more likely than in

Middlesbrough to send their children to
independent schools. Even in South-West
Hertfordshire, however, a steep social
gradient is perceptible; the son of parents in
the professional and managerial groups
having almost exactly three times as great a
chance of reaching a grammar school as the
son of a skilled manual worker, and four
times the chance of the son of an unskilled
worker. The Middlesbrough gradient is
steeper, with the corresponding proportions
standing at five to one and seven and a half
to one respectively. The children of the
lower middle-class groups occupy intermediate positions, with success rates that
are very similar in the two areas. About
one-quarter of the sons of supervisors and
small tradesmen reach the grammar school,
and just over one-third of the sons of clerks.

Social Distribution of Ability

To the extent that access to the grammar
school is primarily dependent in the first
instance upon some form of examination
performance, it is clearly umrealistic to
divorce a discussion of differential class
chances from some consideration of the
social distribution of ability. Earlier critics
of the then inequalities of educational
opportunity in this country were mainly
concerned with the gross discrepancies
between the proportion of children in each
social class who by their performance in
intelligence tests gave evidence of a certain
level of intellectual capacity and the proportion who enjoyed the benefits of secondary
education; they made no attempt to minimize the substantial differences in measured
intelligence between social classes. We tried
therefore to ascertain whether ability and
opportunity, as thus defined, stand in a closer .
relationship to-day than in the 1930s. Within
the areas in which our investigation was
carried out our sources of information were
very limited as far as pre-war years are
concerned, but left little doubt that many
able children of working-class origin lacked.
opportunity in the period before 1944. This
was particularly marked in South-West.
Hertfordshire, but applied also in Middles198

brough until the late 1930s. It is interesting
in this context to look again at the findings of
Gray and Moshinsky’s study, carried out in
1933-34, of a representative sample of
London children attending all types of
primary school, private and preparatory as
well as public elementary schools. They
showed that while nearly all the children of
the larger business owners and the professional classes who possessed adequate ability
had. the opportunity of higher (i.e. grammar
type) education, the corresponding figure for
the children of clerical and commercial
employees was 50 per cent, for those of
skilled wage-earners 30 per cent and for the
children of unskilled wage-earners 20 per
cent. Given a lower criterion of ability, only
I per cent of the children of unskilled
workers received higher education compared
with nearly half the children of larger
business owners and more than one-third of
those of professional people. An analysis on
similar lines of the results of the local
selection examinations showed that in the
years of our inquiry a remarkably close
approximation of opportunity to ability had
been achieved. Our method was to calculate
the minimum I.Q. which would have sufficed
for entry to the grammar school, given the
number of places available in the years in
question, had measured intelligence been the
only criterion of selection, and then to
compare within each social group the
number of children having I.Q.s above the
postulated minimum with the number
actually admitted to grammar schools. We
found an almost perfect agreement between
the actual and the hypothetical social
distribution of grammar school places. It is
important to recall that the selection
procedure was in fact fairly complex in both
areas; although intelligence tests played a
part they received no greater weight than did
standardized tests of attainment in English
and Arithmetic, while in South-West Hertfordshire the examination included fairly
important subjective components. There
can be no doubt that a rough equality of
educational opportunity, in the sense in
which we are using the term, had been
established in both areas. .

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Home Background

We now turn to consider the question—in
what respects, if any, do the home backgrounds of children who are awarded
grammar school places differ from those of
the children who are unsuccessful in the
selection examination? The information
collected at our interviews with parents was
perhaps not exceptionally subtle, but it did
cover a useful range of items—income, type
of housing, size of family, education of both
parents, occupation of mother before
marriage, and the attitudes and ambitions of
the parents in relation to the child’s secondary
and further education. By relating this
information to the results of the selection
examination, we were able to ascertain to
what extent success in obtaining grammar
school places varied according to each of
these factors. Since each of them was to
some extent correlated with social class, we
divided the samples in each area into the five
occupational classes shown in Table 1, and
carried out our analyses within these classes.
The results of the analyses appear in
Tables 2, 3 and 4, and the patterns of
relationship in the two areas provide an
interesting contrast. In South-West Hertfordshire the success rates in the competition
for places are virtually the same for families
at a given social level, regardless of whether
their income is rated “ high” or “ low”’ or
whether they occupy a detached or semidetached or a terraced house. But in
Middlesbrough the more prosperous groups
at each social level show markedly superior
rates. Thus, for example, among the children
of skilled workers who earned a basic income
of more than £7 Ios. per week and who
occupied a detached or semi-detached house,
the success rate was twice as high as among
those from the less prosperous and wellhoused families at the same occupational
level.

There is, however, no such marked
difference between the areas in the relation
between success in the selection examination
and the educational and social background
of parents and their interest in and ambitions
for their children’s educational future. In
HOME BACKGROUND AND SELECTION FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION 199

both areas and at all social levels the

proportion of awards was noticeably higher
to those children whose parents had enjoyed
a selective secondary education, or some
further education, and in the case of
working-class children to those whose
mothers’ occupation before marriage was of
superior standing to that of their fathers.
The importance of parents’ attitudes also
was marked in both districts. Thus among
the children of skilled workers, those whose
parents had expressed a strong preference
for a grammar school for their child’s
secondary education, or who had shown
enough interest in their child’s future to
discuss it with the Head or a Class Teacher
at the primary school, three times as high a
proportion were successful as of children at
the same social level whose parents took less
interest in their education.

Evidently, the general level of material
prosperity im all social classes in South-West
Hertfordshire is high enough for any consistent influence on success rates from this
direction to be eliminated, leaving the
education, attitudes and ambitions of parents
as the only clearly distinguishing characteristics of successful candidates and the only
consistent environmental influences on the
rate at which children in every social class
obtain grammar school places. These factors
are also important in the case of Middlesbrough children; but there the influence of
the material environment of homes cannot
be discounted in the same way.

Members of this Society will not be
surprised to learn that in both districts size
of family was related to success in the
selection examination. On closer study,
however, the relationship appears to be
fairly complex, and not one that would
justify a simple explanation. In the first
place, the negative correlation is unambiguously shown in both areas only in the
working-class groups; in the middle-class
categories the relationship is much less clear,
and there is a distinct suggestion that
middle-class children from medium-sized
families have, on the average, better examination results than those who are only
children or have a single brother or sister—

though admittedly the numbers are small.
Secondly, it is worth noting that the inverse
relationship was much less marked among
the children of Roman Catholic families in
Middlesbrough.

Tables 2, 3 and 4 show how a number of circumstances, and what happened - when

individual factors are each related to examination performance, but do not give sufficient
indication of their relative strength. We
were interested to know what happened when
parents had marked educational ambitions
for their children, but lived in poor material

they were comfortably off but educationally
Philistine. This part of the analysis was
restricted to the children of manual workers
in both areas. The family backgrounds of
the middle-class children were too nearly
uniform, in respect of both attitudes to
HOME BACKGROUND AND SELECTION FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION or

education and an absence of poor material
conditions, for an extension of this analysis
to be profitable.

The relevant information was available in
respect of 774 children aged 10-11 of
skilled and unskilled manual workers in
Middlesbrough and 933 in South-West Hertfordshire. The children were grouped according to an assessment, in simple quantitative
terms, of the ‘“ favourable’’ or “‘ unfavourable’’ material aspects of their home
environment. Homes were awarded one
mark in respect of each of the following
characteristics: a “‘good’’ basic income
(i.e. Senior wage-earner income of more than
£7 Ios. per week); good housing (i. a
detached or semi-detached or council house) ;
absence of overcrowding (i.e. at least one
room per person) ; amenities (car, telephone or
television). The maximum score obtainable
was thus 4, and those homes with a total of
3 or 4 points were classified as “‘ favourable ”’
and those with 0, I or 2 as “‘ unfavourable.”

A similar summary index was devised to
express the favourable or unfavourable
nature of parental attitudes to education.
The following were each awarded one mark:
at least one visit to the primary school in the
course of the year of the inquiry for reasons
connected with education, including the
discussion of the child’s secondary education
with the Head Teacher or an assistant; a
stated preference for some form of selective
secondary education; the intention of keeping
the child at school at least to the age of
sixteen; the wish that the child should
undergo some form of further education or
training on leaving school. The classification
of homes into ‘“‘ favourable ”’ and “ unfavourable’? in this “cultural” respect was
likewise based on the size of the total score—
3 or 4 favourable, and 0, I or 2 unfavourable.

The relation of the different types of home
environment to the success of working-class
children in obtaining grammar school places
is shown in Table 5. Among the children
whose homes are neither “‘ wholly favourable’? nor ‘wholly unfavourable”’ the
success rate was highest amongst those
(group 2b) whose parents are favourably
disposed towards their educational prospects ;

the educational chances, especially in SouthWest Hertfordshire, of children whose homes
offer only material comfort (group 2a) were
considerably less promising. It is a striking
fact that in Middlesbrough, more than half
of the fathers of children in group 2b are in
fact unskilled workers. Their families are
more frequently restricted to one or two
children than is the case in group 2a, where
the fathers are mainly skilled workers, more
prosperous but less favourably disposed to
the education of their children. Yet the
average level-of intelligence among children
in group 2b is no higher than among those
in 2a. The superiority of their success rate
may therefore be taken to represent the
direct influence of the encouragement and
interest of their parents. It seems reasonable
to infer that any improvement in the
material environment of these children at
home or school would result in a higher
success rate. Rehousing and new school
buildings and modern amenities could be
expected to “ show results ”’ fairly rapidly.

In South-West Hertfordshire the situation
of this group (2b) of children is rather
different. A smaller but still sizeable proportion—some 40 per cent—of the fathers are
unskilled workers. There is a much stronger
tendency than in Middlesbrough for their
families to be smaller, and their mean I.Q. is
substantially higher than that of children
coming from families in the more prosperous
group 2a. There is clearly less scope here
than in Middlesbrough for improvement in
the success rate (23 per cent) of these children,
which in any case hardly differs from that of
202

the group of children from homes rated
“wholly favourable ’’ (21 per cent). It is
evident that the material environment of the
home is not a significant influence on success
in South-West Hertfordshire, where it is not
merely less varied than in Middlesbrough but
of a better standard at all social levels.

Intelligence Tests

These findings have, I think, widespread
implications, social, educational and psychological, and few of them can be pursued in
the brief time available. I should like,
however, to comment on one problem that
arises from the study, namely the interpretation of the strong positive relationships
between examination performance (which
includes intelligence test performance) and
these various aspects of home background,
relationships which still hold good when
occupational class is held constant. There is
a simple explanation which is bound to be
suggested—that these indices of home background which are prognostic of good examination performance are merely reflections of
superior intelligence in the parents, which
will have been genetically transmitted . to
their children. I do not for a moment doubt
that there are substantial elements of truth
in this theory, but if it is put forward as a
complete explanation I would suggest that it
over-simplifies the problem and is indeed
intrinsically lacking in plausibility, since
some of the most significant features of home
background’in this respect are essentially to
be classified as motivational in character,

and as having only a limited association with —

intelligence.

Many of the earlier onthexs on intelligence
testing argued that these tests measured a
genetically determined innate capacity. Convincing evidence in support of such an
extreme theory has never been adduced; at
the same time, it has never been possible to
substantiate empirically the equally extreme
view of differences in measured intelligence
as the product merely of variations in the
social and cultural environment, immune to
genetic influences.

The relationship between the sets of
causal factors is clearly one of interaction;

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

environment is not simply superimposed
upon heredity in such a way that it would be
possible to conceive of intelligence as the sum
of the two components. Nevertheless, it may
be useful to make a distinction as Hebb®*—
whose starting point was in the study of
brain lesions—has proposed, between what
he calls Intelligence A and Intelligence B. By
Intelligence A he refers to an innate intellectual capacity whose existence can only be
postulated, and which cannot be observed or
measured, while Intelligence B refers to the
complex product which is employed in
human behaviour and which can be assessed
by means of tests. The transition from
Intelligence A to Intelligence B involves a
series of learning experiences—using the
term in the widest possible sense—and some
of the conditions of learning will vary not
merely idiosyncratically but to somé extent
systematically as between different social
groups and categories. In short, although I
do not wish to suggest that the crude indices
of home background that we have employed.
can be regarded as social determinants of
intelligence, I do think that they indicate the
type of influences which among others might
be worth analysing more closely, should a
serious examination of social and cultural
influences in the development of intelligence
ever be seriously undertaken. This comment
by no means invalidates the use of intelligence
tests for selection purposes, where the aim is
to assess educability in the restricted sense of
capacity to profit from education within
secondary schools as at present organized,
and where the question of origin is largely
From this admittedly limited
point of view the intelligence test provides
an instrument of prediction which is administratively convenient, statistically reliable
and reasonably, though imperfectly, valid.
