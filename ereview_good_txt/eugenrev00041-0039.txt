JAPAN’S POPULATION PROBLEM’
By C. P. BLACKER

R. L. N. Jackson’s ‘‘ Passport to
D Tokyo,’’ which appears elsewhere in

this number, provides a compact yet
.comprehensive survey of the wide ground
covered at the fifth international conference
of the International Planned Parenthood
Federation (IPPF) held from October 24th
‘to 2gth, 1955, at Tokyo. The present
article has a narrower scope than Dr. Jackson’s. Its object is to outline the contemporary predicament of Japan as it was described to us in some thirty-three papers by
Japanese authorities and as it is set forth in
a valuable booklet—a model of clarity and
succinctness—produced just before the conference by Dr. Minoru Muramatsu.

On the last of this booklet’s 120 pages will
bé found a postscript which might well have
‘appeared as a preface. The signed postscript is dated August 1955 ; hence, allowing for delays of publication, the documentation could scarcely be more up to date.f
Unless otherwise stated, the figures given
below are taken from this booklet.

* This article is based on an account of the Tokyo
conference given by Dr. Blacker to Fellows and Members of the Society on Wednesday November 23rd,
1955, at 69 Eccleston Square. The paper submitted
by Dr. Blacker to the Tokyo conference was published
in the last (January 1956) issue of the EUGENICS

Demographic History

During the 264 years of the Togukawa
Shogunate (1603-1867), Japan’s population
is thought to have remained approximately
stable, having fluctuated round the figure of
about thirty million. Japan was then much
cut off from the outside world ; she was
economically self-sufficient and her natural
resources wete clearly seen to be finite. The
realistic outlook of the people and of their
leaders coupled with the feudal character of
the then prevailing culture aided the taking
of drastic measures to adjust numbers to
resources. Both abortion and infanticide
were freely practised, and we are told that
the term mabiki, originally meaning the
thinning of seedlings, was undiscriminatingly used to denote these two measures.

After the Meiji restoration (1868), however, infanticide was suppressed and the
country was opened up to western influences.
The population then increased fairly rapidly
until, by 1912, it had reached 51.6 million.
In response to the pioneering and crusading
zeal of Dr. Kan Majima and also of Baroness
Shidzue Ishimoto (now Mrs. S. Kato: this
lady played a prominent part in the Tokyo
conference, having been chairman of the
conference’s planning committee, and being,
with Dr. Koya and Dr. Majima, a vicepresident of the Family Planning Federation
of Japan), a birth control movement was
started shortly after the first world war.
The movement reacted vigorously to an
early visit (in 1922) to Japan by Mrs.
Margaret Sanger (to-day’s president of the
IPPF) after which a clinic was opened in
Tokyo. But officialdom, which had always
been suspicious, became actively hostile in
the late twenties when pro-natalist policies
were introduced by the government then in
power. In 1940, a National Eugenic Law

THE EUGENICS REVIEW, April 1956, 48, 1.
32 | THE EUGENICS REVIEW

(not to be confused with the Eugenics Protection Law of eight years later) was introduced, of which the main purpose was the
“building up of a larger and _ stronger
nation.” : .

With the ending of the second world war,
Japan was confronted with a truly formidable problem. The birth rate (34.3 in 1947: see
Figure 2) was the highest for over twenty years
—higher than it had been throughout the
period of pro-natalist propaganda; the
death rate (14.6 in 1947) was the lowest then
on record ; room had to be found for some
four to five million repatriates ; towns were
in ruins, the war had been lost, and Japan
was shorn of her empire. The population
(70.8 million in 1939) had swollen by over
seven million (78.1 million in 1947, see Figure
1). Figures 1 and 2 show the trends which
have since prevailed. In the course of the
last nine years, the birth rate has steadily
declined. From a figure of over 34 per
thousand in 1947, it has fallen to below 20
in 1954. But this noteworthy decline in
fertility has been more than offset by the
newly acquired powers of death control. The
death rate (see Figure 2) which for earlier
years had been conspicuously and consistently lower than the birth rate, has fallen

MILLIONS OF POPULATION

FIGURE I.

from the figure of 14.6 in 1947 (the lowest on
record at that time) to that of 8.2 in 1954.
This last figure is lower than that of the
death rate in England and Wales ; but the
disparity, seemingly favourable to Japan, is
attributable to the differing age-structures
of the two countries’ populations, that of
Japan being younger than ours.* It will be
seen from Figure 1 which shows the growth
of Japan’s population that numbers have increased by about a million a year from 78
million in 1947 to an estimated figure of.
nearly ninety million last year. Japanese
demographers regard it as almost inevitable
that, twenty years hence, the figure will top
the hundred million mark.

It is little wonder that apprehensions and
forebodings are widely felt. Some of those
expressed at the Conference are touched on
by Dr. L. N. Jackson in that portion of his
paper which is headed “ Japanese Misgivings.” The precarious balance of the
country’s economy, based on foreign aid,
and the consequences for Japan if that aid

** The expectation of life at birth is higher here than
there by over five years for men and by over six years
for women. Age-specific death rates are generally
lower here than there.

were cut off, are only too well understood.
The existing prevalence of unemployment
and tnderemployment are an unescapable
reminder of the hazards of the future. So
is another factor not mentioned by Dr.
Jackson : the agricultural land of Japan is
so intensively cultivated and sustains so
large an agricultural population (see below)
that the countryside can provide work for
few more. people ; hence there is a massive
drift to the big towns where life can be
sustained on imported food and where employment can be found in factories. The
earnings of the industrial worker, however,
compare favourably with those of the agricultural labourer. As a legacy of General
MacArthur’s regime, trade unions are developing. But wage claims entail rising
prices, and rising prices entail export difficulties. Yet the slogan “ export or starve,”’
with which we have become familiar in
Britain since the war, is more applicable to
Japan than tous. I was'told by-a Japanese

economist that the drift to greater Tokyo.

from the countryside enlarges the population
of that city by between 300,000 and 400,000
people a year.

Professor Juitzi Kitaoka (an influential

welcome

econonust) is quoted by Dr. Jackson as
saving that many young Japanese would
a communist revolution in the
preposterous hope that their country’s problems might thereby be solved. (This remark was one of the few features of the

conference which was reported in the British

press). One is reminded by Professor Kitaoka’s warning of Dr. Colin Bertram’s observations* about the disturbing effects of abnormal degrees of population density on the.
behaviour of certain animals; and about
how comparable reactions—mainly of morbid excitability and proneness to violence—
might occur among human beings.

The population pyramid for Japan (Fig.
3), based on the figures for the 1952 census,
is in a general way characteristic of countries
which have reached the late-expanding phase
of the population cycle--when birth and
death rates are both declining, with the
death rate at a lower level than the other
throughout. Each tier or horizontal block
here represents a five-year age group (quinquennium). Three points are noteworthy.

FIGURE 3. POPULATION OF JAPAN AT 1952 CENSUS
(United Nations Demographic Yearbook, 1954)

The first is the deficit (reflecting war casualties) of males (born between 1908 and 1927,
aged from 25 to 44 in 1952, and from 18 to
37 in 1945) compared with females. A
glance shows that the tiers relating to these
four age-groups are shorter on the left side
of the figure than on the right. By how much
shorter they are can be seen by a comparison
of the figures at the outer extremities of the
tiers showing percentages of males and
females during these twenty years. How
the war upset the balance between the sexes
can also be seen by comparing these considerable differences with the small differences between the proportions of the sexes
in other age-groups. The deficit of males
aged twenty-five to forty-four in 1952 represents war losses amounting to some two
million killed. This feature of the pyramid

—a deficit of males of certain age-groups—
is characteristic of countries which have
suffered heavy casualties in the world wars.

The second noteworthy feature of the
pyramid is the slowing down of the rate of
increase during the decade 1933 to 1947—
the prewar and the war years ; people born
during these fifteen years are represented by
the last three tiers but one in the figure
which, on each side, differ little in length.

The third and perhaps the most noticeable
feature is the wide base provided by the
bottom tier which represents children under
five. This feature may seem at first sight
difficult to reconcile with the fact that, as
Figure 2 shows, the gap between birth and
death rates was narrowing between 1948 and
1952. The fact, however, is that no agegroup benefited more during these years
JAPAN’S POPULATION PROBLEM | 35

from the decline in mortality than that
comprising young’children. The infant death
rate fell by some twelve points from 61.7 per
thousand live births in 1948 to 49.4 in 1952.

Population and Arable Land

The United Kingdom and Japan can be
usefully compared. The figures are taken
from a paper entitled Some Remarks on the
Overpopulation of Japan, by Professor J.
Kitaoka who quotes as his source the U.N.’s
statistics for 1954 and those of F.A.O. for

1953.
Population and Arable Land

Japan U.K.
Population (1953 : millions) .. 88.2* 51.1
Total Area (square miles) ... 142,000 94,209
Arable Land : Hectares: in 1000’s
(1 hectare = 2.47 acres) ... ... 5,095 7,326
Arable Land per head of Population :
_ Hectares wee wee ... 0.06 0.14
Agricultural Labour Force: in
00's vee Lee bee .. 18,080 1,112
Agricultural Land per head of agricultural labour force: Hectares... 0.28 6.5

It will be seen that Japan’s population and
also her total area are substantially larger
than the U.K.’s but that Japan has less
arable land than the U.K. (about fivesevenths, much of her country being moun‘tainous) ; that she has less than half the
arable land per head of total population ;
and that, having an agricultural labour force
more than sixteen times larger than ours,
she has less than a twentieth of the area of
agricultural land per agricultural worker.

In the course of excursions to Nikko,
Atami, Hakone, Kyoto and Nara we passed
through both flat and mountainous country.
The intense degree of the cultivation of the
arable land—almost wholly by hand and
much of it under rice—was noticeable. There
were few visible draught animals, cattle,
sheep or machines ; but tethered goats were
commonly seen. Holdings seemed very
small, and there was little grass or grazing
land. Superficial impressions of tourists are
not reliable guides to truth ; but for what
they were worth, ours made it understand
* This figure is larger than that shown for 1953 in
Figure 1. The difference seems to be due to the inclusion of the occupying forces in this and not in the
other figure.

able that Japan’s agricultural labour force
was large and that there was little room for
more people on the land. Indeed, the introduction of mechanisation into agriculture,
far from employing more people, would increase the already considerable redundancy.

The Eugenics Protection Law of 1948

The above-described post-war predicament of Japan called for urgent action. It
is this urgency which accounts for the
drastic nature of the provisions of the
Eugenics Protection Law of 1948. This act,
which facilitates the resort to sterilization,
abortion and birth control, has been amended
five times between April 1949 and September
1954. Its object is declared to be: “ To
prevent an increase of inferior descendants
from the standpoint of eugenic protection,
and to protect the life and health of the
mother.’ Most of the amendments seem to
have facilitated the resort to these three
practices ; the most important—that made
in May 1952—absolved doctors from the necessity of obtaining in advance (from an
officially appointed Eugenics Protection
Committee) approval for a proposed abortion. The outcome of the act is that the
practice of all three methods of restricting
births has greatly increased in the last six
years.

Sterilization
There has been a sixfold increase between
1949 and 1954. Operations reported as

-having been performed under the provisions

of the Eugenics Protection law are as follows:

1949 .-. 5»752
1950 .. 11,403
1951 .. 16,233
1952 ... 22,424
1953 --- ... 32,552
1954 . 38,056

The great majority of the operations were
on females. In only about one in forty
cases was the subject a male. The main
reason for the operations performed in 1954
was maternal protection—about 96 per cent
of cases. The remaining four per cent comprised the following categories : Hereditary.
diseases (under one per cent : 333 cases in
36. THE EUGENICS REVIEW

1954) ; and leprosy (122 cases). The Law
(article 4) seems to make provision for what
amounts to a modified compulsion: the
physician can apply to a Prefectural Eugenic
Protection Council to decide whether a person should be sterilized because of some
thirty physical or mental diseases which are
set out in a list annexed to the Act. In
1954, 840 persons were sterilized under this
provision, about four in ten being males. In
the event of a person suffering from mental
diseases or deficiency of such a sort that he
cannot give a valid consent, the Act (article
12) makes provision for such a consent to be
obtained from “ the person responsible for
the individual ’’—the spouse, parent or
guardian where available or, in the absence
of such, the mayor of the individual’s town
or village. In 1954, 160 persons were sterilized under this provision.

Sterilizing operations are rather more often
performed on rural than urban populations
—in the ratio of 54.4 to 45.6. . The method
of cornual (intra-uterine) cauterisation instead of tubal ligation is also performed.
Dr. Yoshio Furusawa, of the Sumida hospital, Tokyo, presented to the Conference a
paper describing 293 sterilisations performed
in his hospital during the two years January
1953 to December 1954. Of these, 213 (72
per cent) were by electro-cautery, 53 by
tubal ligation and 27 by vasectomy. Good
results are claimed for the method of tubal
cautery which is, of course, far simpler than
that of tubal ligation. Another valuable
paper on the former method was given by
Professor B. H. Shears of the Department of
Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University
of Malaya, who seems to have developed a
reliable and satisfactory technique.

Abortion

The numbers have increased between fourand five-fold between 1949 and 1954. They
are as follows :

1949 ... 246,104
Ig50 . 489,111
1951 ... 638,350
1952 .. 798,193
1953 .-- 1,068 ,066
1954 .-. 1,143,059

There was some criticism of the Governments abortion policy. Attention was drawn
to its possible harmfulness, especially if performed after the third month of the pregnancy, and to the rapidity with which
further pregnancies often ensued. It was
also argued by Dr. Yasuaki Koguchi, of the
Public Health Department of Kanagawa
Prefectural Government, that the reasons
for terminating pregnancies given in the
official returns could differ from those
entered on the clinic cards used at the
hospital. Diseases and abnormal conditions
mentioned in the official returns were sometimes not recorded on the hospital caseSheets. It was fairly obvious that misgivings were widely felt about the course of
events, and that these lent weight to the
policy of replacing the abortion policy by
one of birth control.

Abortions were rather more commonly
sought by urban than by rural populations,
the ratios being roughly the converse of
those above-quoted for sterilization.

The cost of an official abortion was remarkably low. A sum of 300 yen (six shillings)
was commonly charged, and sometimes as
little as 50 yen (one shilling). That is to say
that an abortion could cost less than a contraceptive appliance—a matter much discussed
in Japan.

In addition to the million or so abortions

officially recorded in the last two years, we

were told that account had to be taken of
an approximately equal number of cland
- estine abortions. In Dr. Muramatsu’s words :

“It may be safe to say that there are upwards of two million induced abortions in
recent years in Japan as a whole and that
the number of induced abortions somewhat
exceeds that of live births. (My italics). Live
births in 1954 amounted to 1.7 millions

which, as shown in Figure 2, yielded a

birth rate of just under 20 per thousand.
Hence if the two million or so pregnancies
which ended in abortions had resulted instead in live births, the birth rate of Japan
might have exceeded forty per thousand and
the country’s demographic predicament
would have been grave indeed. It is against
such possibilities as these that Japan’s aborPe JAPAN’S POPULATION PROBLEM | . 37

tion policy, which the Japanese are the first
to criticize, must be assessed.

Birth Control

- No less than thirteen surveys of the prevalence of contraceptive practices in Japan
have been made between 1947 and 1954.
Of these the most comprehensive and also
the latest was one conducted by the Ministry
of Welfare in April 1954. No less than
123,000 householders were approached by a
questionnaire method. There was a 76 per
cent response (94,000 householders) which
suggested that birth control was then being
used by 33.2 per cent of the sample. This
figure was higher than that yielded by
earlier surveys. It is noteworthy and important that this inquiry was conducted by a
Mimistry, a circumstance which I believe to
be unique. I know of no other country
where such an inquiry has been officially
conducted. The nearest approach to such
a course in Britain was that adopted by the
Royal Commission on Population (19441949). But here the investigation (that
which bears the name of Dr. E. LewisFaning) was carried out as it were by proxy.
The responsibility was taken by the Royal
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,
and some apprehensiveness was felt throughout about the possible effects of a premature
and misleading publicity.

An elaborate organisation exists in Japan
for disseminating as quickly as possible a
knowledge of birth control. The programme
makes available appropriate training for
qualified doctors who then become known
as “designated physicians.’’ Of these, in
August 1954, there were over nine thousand.
The “designated physicians” relay their
knowledge to a much larger number of
“practical instructors of conception control,’ most of whom are licensed midwives.
Of these there were, in August 1954, over
28,000. The training programme is undertaken by the Ministry of Welfare (weekly
courses three times a year for doctors) and
also by Prefectural Governments (there are
forty-six prefectures in Japan) which hold
courses for doctors, midwives, and nurses.
These courses have elaborate syllabuses :

 

that for nurses requires over sixty. hours of
instruction. ‘

The education of the public is also conducted by “country-wide publicity campaigns through radio and newspapers and by
cinema films.’’ We were shown such a film
made at a fishing village (Fukuura) which
we visited. Here Dr. Yoshio Koya had
initiated an intensive education of a village
population in birth control principles. The
film included a diagrammatic demonstration
of the processes of reproductive physiology
which was of a frankness and realism which
would have made the film’s exhibition in an
English village, and, Lady Rama Rau told
me, in an Indian village, impossible.

Japan’s Ministry of Welfare has in the
last three years stepped up its annual budget.
The sum allocated to the promotion and
practice of contraception in 1955 (58,686,000
yen) was more than twice that of the previous
year (28,860,000 yen) ; and I have been un-.
officially informed that, in the plans for 1956,
a sum three times larger than that for 1955 is
contemplated.

These large-scale investigations, comprehensive administrative arrangements, and
substantial budgetary allocations all testify
to the urgency with which the Japanese
Government regards the tasks of checking
the widening resort to abortion and of replacing it by the more acceptable practice
of birth control.

The birth control methods which have been
found most acceptable are noteworthy.
Contrary to the expectation of western
observers, the condom is easily the most
favoured method. The following figures as
to its use as a single method are hereunder

38 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Thus the condom is most favoured by the
‘general (unguided) population (Ministry of
Welfare’s survey) ; it leads the next most
favoured method by more than 13 per cent.
The condom surprisingly, seems to be yet
more favoured by the experimental populations which were introduced to several
possible methods. In the three villages, it
led by over 30 per cent ; and in the coal
mine it led by over 54 per cent, having
gained (in a manner not shown in the above
table) over other methods in popularity in
the course of the three years during which
the experiment had lasted.

Most noteworthy is the outcome of the
experiments designed to test the acceptability of birth control. In 1950 three villages were selected by Dr. Koya for this
purpose and have been kept under observation since. Three years later (March 1953)
another comparable experiment was begun
in a coal mining district some 100 miles
north of Tokyo (the Joban Coal Mining
Company, Iwasaki district). The results
(communicated to the conference by Dr.
Kova) can be summarised as follows :

Three Experimental Villages : 690 Families

Year 1949-50 1954-55

Birth rate 2.6 13.8

Birth rate in Joban 33.5 21.4 14.4
Induced abortions in

Joban ... sas .. = 63 91 49

It will be seen that, in the three villages,
the birth rate was nearly halved in five
years and that, by the last of these years,
abortions had dropped by nearly half.
Among the Joban coal miners the course of
events was even more remarkable. In three
years, the birth rate fell from a figure some
ten points above the national average to one
more than five points below that average ;
and the birth rate more than halved in three
years. Abortions varied much over the

three years being highest in the second and.

easily lowest in the last. If the figures

truly represent what happened the results of
these three experiments are in conspicuous
contrast to that promoted in Ramanagaram
(India) which was designed to test the
acceptability of the rhythm method. No
perceptible influence was there detectable on
the birth rate, the rhythm method being
found to be almost wholly unacceptable to
a rural population.

In Japan, moreover, the rhythm method
came second to the condom in the Ministry
of Welfare’s Survey and in the three villages,
a result which can be contrasted with the
rejection of the method in the Ramanagaram experiment. It has been suggested that
the rhythm method may have been made
familiar to Japanese through the work of
Dr. Ogino who, with the Austrian Dr. Knaus,
made this method widely known.

General Conclusion

Astonishing results, which few people
would have dared to predict, have been
achieved in introducing to experimental
village populations in Japan the principles
and methods of family planning.

The Japanese government has embarked
on an energetic programme of introducing
these same methods to the country as a
whole, and the last and largest of several
surveys suggests that the practice of family
planning is fairly rapidly spreading.

A government-sponsored policy of facilitating abortion seems to have over-reached
itself ; the results are now widely criticised.
It is impossible to say how successful the
new policy—of substituting the practice of
family planning for that of abortion—will
prove to be. It may perhaps be successful
beyond what now looks like reasonable expectation and it is not impossible that the
gloomy forecasts of demographers that the
population of Japan will soon exceed a
hundred million may, like other seemingly
well-founded forecasts of demographers, be
falsified. In no country are the relevant
motivations, deriving from both personal.
and national considerations, more powerful
than in Japan; in none can the relevant
education be conducted with greater freedom
from cultural taboos; and in none does the
