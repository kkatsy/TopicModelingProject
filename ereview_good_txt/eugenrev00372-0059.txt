GALTON DAY. 351

entrusted to a skilled staff) would furnish infinitely more exact
data than that which we already possess on human heredrty,
and on the manner in which the influence of heredity is combined with other influences.

In the meantime our society should seek the aid of other
associations to elucidate as fully as possible those questions,
still so obscure, upon which depends the life of the nation. The
importance thereof grows day by day in proportion as we
claim to substitute for the too rough proceedings of nature a
method in which reason has its place, and in which human
feeling plays the largest part.

GALTON DAY.

Ir has been felt for some time that steps should be taken to
insure that the name of Sir Francis Galton may be permanently
connected with the eugenics movement so that, as the public
becomes more and more familiar with the word, the meaning
which he attached to it may not be lost sight of. For this
reason the Council of the Society have decided to hold annually
on February 16th, being the anniversary of his birth, a Galton
lecture and dinner in commemoration with that event, hoping
thereby not only to further the objects defined above but also to
provide an opportunity for friendly intercourse between eugenists.
The first lecture and dinner will take place on Monday, February
16th, at the Hotel Cecil. The dinner will begin at 7 p.m. and
the lecture at 8.30 p.m. Sir Francis Darwin, F.R.S., has
kindly consented to deliver the lecture. The price of dinner
tickets will be 7s. 6d. each. The issue of tickets, which entitle
the holder to a seat at the lecture, is not restricted to members
of the Society. Members and associates who do not wish to be
present at the dinner may attend the lecture without payment
and are invited to bring friends. Applications for tickets and
all enquiries should be addressed to the Hon. Secretary, Galton
Celebration Committee, Eugenics Education Society, Kingsway
House, Kingsway, W.C.
