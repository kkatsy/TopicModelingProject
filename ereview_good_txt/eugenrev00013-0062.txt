The Distribution by Age and Marital
Status of the Population of England
and Wales in I96I1

SOME FACTS

IT IS UNFORTUNATE for those interested in
statistical questions of fertility that the programme of British Census publications provides
for the issue of the Tables relative to the family
at the end of a protracted series of volumes.
Nevertheless, progress is being made with the
1961 Census releases and a Report relating to
Age, Marital Conditions and General Tables,
has now appeared.* Its principal interest to
members of the Society is in respect of the
information it contains about proportions
married, while the question of age-composition
is also relevant. As, however, estimates of the
distribution of the population by age and marital
status are published annually, and figures for
1961 have already been provided some while
ago, it is of more importance to test the accuracy
of the estimates against the Census out-turn
than it is to look at the general characteristics
of the data. The expected and actual proportions
married are as follows:

PROPORTIONS MARRIED

It will be seen that the estimates were very
successful and should have been fully sufficient
for most practical purposes.

The comparison with 1951 at the younger ages
is as follows:

PROPORTIONS MARRIED

(England and Wales) Men Women
Age 1951 1961 1951 1961
15-19 0:01 0-01 0-04 0:07
20-24 0-23 0-31 0-48 0-58
25-29 0-65 0-70 0-77 0-84
30-34 0-80 0-82 0-83 0-88
35-39 0-85 0-86 0-83 0-88
40-44 0-87 0-88 0-81 0-86

and it illustrates not only the strong tendency
towards younger marriage, with which readers
will be familiar, but also the improved chances
of marriage available to women—representing
a cut of about one-third in the numbers
permanently remaining spinsters.

The new Census volume goes, of course,
much further into detail than the yearly estimates
could. It not only provides figures for individual
ages and for various areas, but also shows the
corresponding figures for earlier censuses and
summarizes the changes that have occurred.
(It furthermore gives the same particulars of
inmates of hotels, boarding houses and other
institutions.)

So far as the distribution of the population
by age is concerned, the following figures
summarize the changes in age-groups between
1951 and 1961 as shown in the table on the
following page.
DISTRIBUTION BY AGE

1951 1961
—— Se, erg
Age number percent number per cent
0-14 9-69 22-2 10-58 23-0
15-44 18-68 42°7 18-18 39-4
45-64 10°56 24-1 11-84 25:7
65 and over 4:83 11-0 5-50 11:9
TOTAL 43-76 46-10
(Millions)

The proportions of the old and the young
have both increased by nearly 1 per cent at the
expense of the working age-groups, where the
population has become a little older on the
average. These changes are mainly a reflection
of changes in fertility at various times in the
past, and in particular they mirror the high

AND MARITAL STATUS

level of births around 1900, the fall in births in
the early part of the century and the recovery
during the past decade.

A further decline in the ratio of numbers of
women to numbers of men is revealed in the
following figures:

Age 1951 1961

0-14 0°95 0:95
15-29 1-03 0-98
30-44 1-03 1-01
45-64 1-15 1-09

The cause of the change is the cessation of
losses of men through mortality and emigration,
and the result is the improved chances of
marriage for women to which reference has been
made above.
