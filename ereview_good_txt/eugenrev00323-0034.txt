SOCIAL PROGRESS AND RACIAL
DECLINE.

By ELpon Moore.

The revelations of the low physical standard of men of military age
which were published in the Report (1917-1919) of the Ministry of
National Service, are now too well known to need quoting. That
Report, however, is a mine of information, which does not seem to have
been much explored. It is,most interesting to compare the figures of
height, weight, and chest measurement for the whole country and for
the Grade A men for this period (1917-1919) with those given for the
whole country in 1883 by the Anthropometrical Committee of the
British Association :

1917—1919 1883

GRADE A. AVERAGE. AVERAGE.
Height in inches... e 7 66 65-7 67°4
Chest Girth in inches oe os 34 32°5—-33 86° 4
Weight in pounds .. “5 es 130 128-4 148° 7

It may be objected that this appalling deterioration is not real, the
1917-19 figures being obtained from the dregs of a war-drained population. This objection is considered and rejected, on good grounds, by
the writers of the Report, who state that, ‘‘The men examined during
the year under review may be regarded in the aggregate as fairly representing the manhood of military age of the country in the early part of
the twentieth century from the standpoint of health and physique.”’
Any such objections, however, should be finally met by the figures,
given below, for boys of 18 years of age:

1917—1919 1883
GRADE A, AVERAGE. AVERAGE.
Height in inches... 44 oe 65°3 65-1 66-9
Chest Girth in inches 8 ae 33:9 32-2 34°2
Weight in pounds .. oe oe 119°4 116°5 131

One of the writers of the 1917 Report states that the figures for 1883
are supported by Roberts’ incomplete investigations in 1878.

The 1883 Committee quote the measurements of recruits to the
Army in the years 1860—64. If these can be taken as a fair sample of
the male population (which is doubtful); then it would appear that the
English nation, physically, was on the up grade until about 1883, when

it started to decline. The measurements here given are for the ages of
18 and 25:

Mean Weight in pounds -- 125-0 135-0

Inaccurate and inadequate classification frequently renders the
1917 Report useless. It affords a reasonable basis, however, for the
following calculations.

Those rejected for ‘‘diseases of the central nervous system’’
(‘‘Mental Deficiency,’’ ‘‘Paralysis,’’ ‘‘Lunacy,’’ ‘‘Neurasthenia,’’
‘“‘Neuritis,’’ ‘‘Epilepsy’’) were in the proportion of 9.59 per thousand
examined. Mental deficiency alone yields a proportion of 3.4 per
thousand, or 3,470 per million. Roughly estimating the population of
England and Wales on January Ist, 1918, at 37,340,000, the total
number of mental defectives at large should then be 129,578. An
unsatisfactory, but conservative, estimate (calculated from the fourth
annual report of the Board of Control) gives the number of those under
care on that date as 26,260. Adding together the two totals, we get a
grand total of 155,833—an increase of 17,304 (or 12 per cent. in 12
years) upon Tredgold’s estimate of 138,529 in the year 1906. Tredgold’s figures give a proportion of 4,032 per million of the population:
these for 1918, give the proportion as 4,157. The whole calculation is
very rough and unsatisfactory; but, in our present shameful ignorance
of the real incidence of amentia, its increase or decrease, these figures
may be some guide.

In the Report of His Majesty’s Inspectors of Constabulary for the

year ended 29th Sept., 1924 (Cmd. 2316, 1925), Sir Leonard Dunning
writes :
‘‘A tabulated statement of the experience of all Chief Constables
bears out what was said last year about the diversity of opinions upon
the quality of candidates and without doubt the selection of really
suitable men for appointment creates one of the most difficult problems
of the day. The general deterioration of the nation’s physique and
the after-effects of war-time privations which are showing in those who
are now reaching manhood account for the large number who are
rejected on medical examination; but perhaps 90 per cent. of the
applicants never get so far as the doctor because they are manifestly
unsuitable, while the simple educational test knocks out so many more
that a Chief Constable is lucky if he finds five suitable men among a
hundred applicants.’ —Five per cent. cannot pass the simple educational
test!

Sir Leonard continues: ‘‘But besides physique and education,
important as they are, character is essential. . . We are getting,
as we always did, some men of this sort, but, if the general morale is
to be raised to anything like the ideal, the proportion must be greater.’’

The Registrar General’s Statistical Review for 1924 states that
the number of marriages during the year was 296,416. 995 men, and
1041 women signed the register by mark. In other words, 3°4 per
thousand of the norma! adult population cannot sign their own names.
126 EUGENICS REVIEW.

The steady fall during the last seventy odd years of the number
of.persons per house is good evidence of improving environment :

Year. Number of persons per house
1851 5°47

1861 5°37

1871 5°33

1881 5°38

1891 5°32

1901 5°20

1911 5°05

1921 4°7

The last figure, which is taken from the 1921 Census, is a significant
comment upon the present ‘‘housing shortage’’: it may, however, be
subject to a little correction by the more accurate estimate of the
number of rooms per person. The earlier figures are taken from the
Census of 1911.

The Report (1909) of the Local Government Board relating to
Public Health and Social Conditions (Cd. 4671) gives the figures for
wages and prices between 1850 and 1907. The following quotation is from the text of the Report, since the charts and tables are a
little misleading:

‘“The net result of the successive changes in the rate of general
wages. . is an apparent increase of over 80 per cent, in
the average rate between 1850 and 1907. But the comparison of
single years cannot properly. be pressed to support this inference.
Comparison can only be drawn between averages calculated over a
course of years, and on this basis it is found that the average rate of
wages In 1900-07 was to the average rate in 1860—1867 as 140 to 100;
in other words, wages have risen in the 40 years by, approximately,
40 per cent.’’ . . . . Average wholesale prices ‘‘show over
the period as a whole an appreciable decrease, notwithstanding some
increase in their level since 1895. Taking the average of prices in the
two periods 1850-60 and 1897-1907, it would appear that the general
level of prices was approximately 24 per cent. lower in the latter
than in the earlier period.

‘ While the bare rate of money wages has increased,
the real increase is materially greater when the purchasing power of
money, as measured by the average price, is taken into account.
The curve of general prices does not fully represent the changes in the
cost of living, since it does not include the item of rent. Rents have
probably, on an average, risen since 1850, but there are no reliable
data for ascertaining the extent of the increase.’’

The following are further extracts of eugenic significance from
the same Report (continued from Censuses and Reports of the
Registrar General):
