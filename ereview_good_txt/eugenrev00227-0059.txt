Mortality Trends

SOME FACTS

T IS OFTEN said that death control has out
run birth control. Nevertheless these forms of

man-made influence on natural events are
intrinsically different and are limited in their
effectiveness by widely disparate conditions.
How is death control faring to-day? The
following table shows the mortality rates for
men, women and children in Great Britain at
various ages in a group of three recent years in
comparison with the rates of 26 years before:

AGE-GROUP GROUP DEATH- RATIO OF DEATH-RATE IN

RATE PER 1,000 IN 1956-58 1956-8 TO THAT OF 1930-2
Males Females Males Females

0 28 21 35 36

1-4 1 1 16 -12

5-14 —(‘5) —(°3) 24 18

15-44 2 1 39 32

45-64 14 8 84 62
65 and

over 79 57 91 ‘77

All ages 12 10 ‘75 64

(Note: The comparison with 1930-32 has been
rendered independent of any changes in the age-distribution of the population since 1930.)

Death control has thus made startling advances in recent years in Great Britain at all ages
between birth and the effective end of the reproductive period of life. In middle and old-age
there have been more moderate improvements.
The chances of survival to adulthood were,
however, already high in 1930-32 and their
improvement could not greatly influence the rate
of reproductivity.

The foregoing figures, and those shown below,
were given by Mr. L. V. Martin in a paper to
the Sixteenth International Congress of Actuaries, held in Belgium this year.

A comparison of British mortality in 1955

with that of countries in Europe, North America
and the Commonwealth in the same year shows
that they all have a generally similar pattern of
death rates, but that there are some appreciable
differences.

COUNTRY DEATH RATES AS PERCENTAGES OF
THOSE IN ENGLAND AND WALES
Whole Boys Women
population aged 0-14 aged 15-44
Norway 75 96 83
Netherlands 83 94 86
Sweden 84 81 91
Denmark 85 101 100
New Zealand 90 93 92
Canada 92 150 104
U.S.A. 97 129 128
Australia 97 103 106
Switzerland 98 117 107
France 100 155 128
England & Wales 100 100 100
East Germany 100 197 139
Belgium 104 165 114
West Germany 106 166 125
Hungary 109 229 138
Austria 109 202 130
Scotland 114 124 128
Finland 124 135 135
Portugal 128 446 166
Yugoslavia 130 468 216

(Note: The comparison is corrected for differences in
age-distribution.)

The chances of survival from birth to age
fifteen vary from 97 per cent in Norway to 84 per
cent in Yugoslavia, and the chances of survival
from age fifteen to age sixty-five vary from 86 per
cent (Norwegian women) to 68 per cent (Yugoslav men).

The countries included in the table are among
the most highly-developed in the world. Mortality in under-developed countries is generally
higher and requires to be separately summarised.
This will be done in a future issue of the REVIEW.
