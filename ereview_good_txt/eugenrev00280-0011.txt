SOME FURTHER RELATIONS BETWEEN
INTELLIGENCE, FERTILITY AND SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS

tribution to this journal*—that in two

representative samples of our population intelligence and fertility are negatively
correlated—permits of being more fully
understood in the light of further relationships obtainable from the data.

In the article concerned and to a still
greater extent in the subsequent book,t I
have ventured to sketch some social and
economic measures which might transform
this dysgenic trend, as far as intelligence is
concerned, into the desired movement towards the distribution of intelligence required
by our complex civilization. The successful
designing of such measures must obviously
depend on more detailed knowledge concerning the interaction of such factors as
intelligence, social status, education, earning
capacity, mode of life and residence in town
or country.

For example, it is of crucial importance to
know whether the same dysgenic trend
exists within any one occupation as in the
community as a whole ; i.e. whether fertility
is primarily associated with the social status
or with the intelligence of the individual
parent. Other relationships which may be
extracted from the available material do not
themselves provide answers to eugenic problems, but they are perhaps worthy of record
from the sociological point of view and they
offer information which, if dovetailed into
other new facts presented by research
workers in different social sciences, may well
lead to the construction of a real science of
eugenic mechanisms. These facts, which are
difficult to set out in any order, because they

in themselves lead nowhere and cannot justly
be made the basis of comprehensive hypotheses until they have been confirmed, concern such matters as the intelligence levels of
occupations in the town and the country and
the relation of intelligence of fathers in various occupations to that of the children of
fathers in those occupations.

To throw light on the first problem—that
of the variation of fertility within any one
occupation—we divided the whole range of
intelligence of the children of fathers in each
occupation into four sections, such that they
would cut off approximately equal portions
of the population on the normal distribution
curve. The mean size of family from which
the children in each section came was then
worked out, with the result shown in
Table I.

In this and subsequent tables the occupations are arranged in descending order of
average fertility. Here the town and country
populations are combined and the number
of families on which each average is based is
inserted in brackets.

Although the number of cases in most
occupational groups is not large enough to

171
172

give uniform and smooth trends, a glance
suffices to show that in most fertility is in
fact inversely related to intelligence.* Apparently the effect is more marked in the less
skilled occupations, but that is a conclusion
which we must test by exacter methods, for,
if proved, it has corollaries in the field of
eugenic legislation.

For each occupation the end result of the
differing quartile fertilities can be found by
multiplying the approximate mean I.Q. in
each quarter (taken as 75, 92, 107 and 130) by
the increase or decrease of population in that
quarter and by comparing the new mean for
all four quarters together with the mean for
the parents, assuming the average I.Q. for the
parents in each group to be the same as that
for the children, i.e. the procedure in calculation is the same as that described in the
previous article for the whole population. In
Table II the differences between the mean
parental and mean child I.Q., as a result of
the differential birth-rate within each occupation are shown.

* This fact, incidentally, would destroy the suspicion,
if technical psychological considerations had not
already destroyed it, frequently found in exaggerated
form among critics unversed in psychometrics, that the
inverse relation of intelligence and size of family is due
to children from homes of low social status being in
some way at a disadvantage in an intelligence test.
A clinical psychologist may perhaps be permitted to
add that the sharp ‘‘ gamin ”’ of the streets is actually
at an advantage compared with the more suggestible
child brought up in a protected home; also the larger
family generally gives advantages in whatever environmental elements may persist in intelligence tests.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

In a recent issue of this REviEw* the
editor commented on the accumulation of
evidence that in certain restricted geographical and occupational groups a reversal
of the usual manifestation of differential
fertility exists. He referred to the work of
Edin and Hutchinson, showing that in
Stockholm higher fertility is associated
with higher income and higher education ;
to the finding of Tietz that in Prussia employers and owners have a higher birth-rate
than wage earners; to Whitney and Huntington’s well-known demonstration of a
eugenic trend in a university population and
concluded ‘“‘ these few instances of atypical
differential fertility offer no grounds for excessive optimism, but they do at least show
that there is not yet reason for despair.”

The restriction of atypicability to so few
and such numerically small groups as manifest it in Table II, above, certainly gives no
grounds for “‘ excessive optimism ”’ in regard
to our own population, but a glance at the
distribution of these groups may be instructive. Apparently the dysgenic trend is not so
bad (within the group) in those groupsf
which have a high birth-rate throughout and
no social pretensions—the unskilled labourers
and farm labourers—than in those in which
a better standard of comfort and social
position obtains—the skilled labourers,
farmers, skilled factory and _ transport
workers. Among the latter there are evidently many practising severe family restriction, and the result is an agreement with my
earlier statement, contested by Dr. Tredgold,
that the arrest of the spread of birth-control
at its present level would be the most
disastrous thing that could occur.

Omitting sailors, who constitute too small
a group for the result to be significant, we
find a eugenic trend only among business
owners and professional men, a result which
has some relation to the results in Stockholm,

* EUGENICS REVIEW, 1937, XXVIII, 260.

+ As stated elsewhere the unemployed in this survey
were largely a ‘‘ social problem group ’”’ and not comparable with unskilled labourers and farm labourers.
Their greater dysgenic tendency here certainly suggests
that they were not governed by the same outlook as
these employed groups economically in no much
better position.
INTELLIGENCE, FERTILITY AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS

Prussia and at Yale. One might be inclined
to generalize that where birth-control is
practised throughout a group to-day the end
result is eugenic.

But clerks and shopkeepers have approximately the same birth-rate as professional
men and business owners and managers, yet
do not attain to a eugenic balance. It is
noteworthy that these dysgenic groups are
lower in average intelligence than the
eugenic groups with the same birth-rate.
(See Table III.) Is the deciding factor
for eugenic or dysgenic trends among groups
determined to practise restriction a higher
economic level, a higher intelligence, a
higher education, a certain relation between
education and economic level, or a uniformity
of mental level demanded by examination
standards, as in the professions ?

The problem may be approached from a
fresh angle by comparing the mean size of
family for the various occupational groups
respectively with the mean intelligence
quotient and the mean earning capacity.

This is done in Table III. Unfortunately
our groups were not primarily arranged with
a view to assessing earning capacity and they
proved to be so wide that specialists could
not agree on the rank order of earning. We
have accordingly set out two rank orders, one
by an economist and one by a skilled social
worker operating in the area concerned.
These two orders, however, correlate to the
extent of 0-93.

Intelligence and Earnings (Econom. rinking) 0 89 \ Mean o- ox

Intelligence and Earnings (Soc. Work +0:92

There is some suggestion therefore that
fertility—or rather restriction of fertility—
is more closely associated with intelligence
than with earnings, though a good part of
the total association of intelligence with low
fertility may be mediated by earnings, for
the correlation of intelligence with earnings
is high.

Any fuller discussion of the factors at work
here would not be realizable without looking
beyond the averages at the actual distribution of sizes of family in the various groups.
For this purpose four representative groups
have been set out in Figure I as illustrations.

The unemployed group has no distinct
peak ; the sizes of family are scattered as if
there is no attempt to aim at any particular
ideal but to leave the matter to the vagaries
of unchecked fertility. In the unskilled
group, however, there is already a marked
peak at the two-child family. Among clerks
there is for the first time a complete absence
of families above six in number, but the
planned family seems to fall at between two
and three children, for families of three are
relatively common in comparison with the
group of unskilled workers. It seems reasonable to suppose that in the latter a certain
section is aiming at a very restricted family
and that the high average family size results
from another section practising no more
restriction than is found in the unemployed
group.

In the professional group there are no
longer any families of six and there is evident
concentration on the ideal of a family of two,
though, in comparison with the clerks, there
is also a distinct avoidance of the one-child
family. A possible conclusion from this
analysis of these representative diagrams is
that if the size of family were a deliberate
choice, as a result of the practice of birthcontrol, in all occupations, the. differential
birth-rate between occupations would become wholly eugenic.

INTELLIGENCE, FERTILITY AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS

Whilst discussing the relations of intelligence and fertility, we must notice the effect
upon our conclusions of the fact that the
intelligence of children arranged according
to parental occupation may not be quite the
same as that of the parents, for, as pointed
out elsewhere,* there are systematic factors
at work other than general regression to the
mean. Chief among these are, (a) the tendency for members of certain occupations to
marry more intelligent wives than do members of other occupations on the same intelligence level, and (5) the tendency of some
occupations to recruit more from families in
which other members are not generally as
intelligent as the one selected.

The latter will tend to occur when recruitment is possible through scholarship selection ;
the former will arise when the economic
and social conditions of an occupation
attract a mate from a better social class than
do the conditions of another occupation
demanding similar intelligence. The adverse
conditions facing, for example, sailors’ and
farm labourers’ wives, might be expected to
restrict the field of choice and lower the intelligence average, and it is noteworthy that
in these occupations the intelligence of the
children is at any rate lower than one would
expect from the fertility order (Table ITI).

Both the above factors affect the professional in comparison with the business
owners group. More of the former are
brighter members obtained by scholarship
selection from the duller families, and, owing
to the earnings being relatively low during
the years of selection for marriage, the choice
of a mate tends to run in a somewhat lower
social class. The children of professional men
are thus in our list actually slightly lower in
intelligence than those of business owners ;
and in most other researches they are not so
much above the children of business owners
as the discrepancy in the intelligence of
fathers would lead one to expect.

It might well be, therefore, that a still
better correlation of fertility with intelligence
would be found in the case of fathers than in

* “Occupational Norms of Intelligence and the
Standardisation of an Adult Intelligence Test.” R. B.
Cattell. Brit. J. Psychol., 1934, XXV.

175

the case of children. In any case the sociological interest of the matter justifies our
setting out results comparing intelligence of
occupational groups respectively for the
fathers and the children. Unfortunately the
few measurements that have been made in
this country directly on adults in occupational groups, being intended for vocational
guidance purposes, have used narrower
groupings than those of the present research.
From my own previous tests on adults,*
with the standards and groupings of which I
am most familiar, I have attempted to
reconstruct groups equivalent to those of the
present research, in the manner indicated by
footnotes to Table IV, in which table the final
averages and approximate scatter for each
group are set out.

the children is the same as that of the fathers,
but in every case the children’s average I.Q.
shows a marked regression to the mean for
the population as a whole. Presumably the
regression would not be so great on the
average of both parents ; so that our method
of calculating the intelligence of one generation from that of the next would not be
fraught with large error.

Though no great reliability can be ascribed
to the measurements of scatter, owing to the
composite character of the equivalent adult
groupings used in the above table, there is yet
a clear general trend for the scatter of the
children to be greater than that of the parents
in the higher intelligence groups and less in
the larger, lower intelligence groups. Differences in the intelligence tests used may
account for an actual reduction of the children’s scatter upon that of the parents, but
the effect of relatively great scatter in certain
occupations must be a real observation.
Greater and lesser regression through more
and less selection of fathers relative to the
fathers’ families and through more and less
assortative mating, working in the manner
discussed above, might well account for
all of this, but if the apparent restriction of scatter in the children of the labouring groups is real we may also need to
suppose that the birth-rate is less in these
groups when mating is not assortative or that
the largest birth-rate is associated with those
fathers who are most typical (in intelligence)
of the occupational group to which they
belong. This last tendency would, of course,
be superposed on the moré pervasive tendency for the birth-rate to increase among
the less intelligent, and might be expected to
throw the highest birth-rate not in the lowest
quarter but in the second quarter from the
bottom. According to Table I, this actually
occurs, with farmers and skilled factory
workers.

Certain differences of the rural and urban
population, which might throw light on the
conditions of eugenic and dysgenic birthrates, need next to be investigated. Here we
shall inquire into the relative fertilities of
the same occupations in town and country,
the comparative decline of fertility with I.Q.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

in those occupations and their actual levels
of average intelligence in town and country.

The results are set out in Tables V and VI.
The relation of fertility to 1.Q. is expressed
by the ultimate effect upon the balance of
I.Q. between the present and the next
generation, calculated for town and country
separately by the same method as that used
in Table II for the whole population.

Neglecting in Table V those occupations
in which fewer than twenty-five cases are involved in either of the totals, we find that the
greater fertility of the rural population runs
through all classes with the exception of
unskilled labourers and unskilled factory
workers. These are perhaps the principal
contributors to the greater dysgenic trend in
the city population as a whole. A glance at
the second part of Table V shows that the
dysgenic factor in the town is higher for
unskilled factory workers than for any other
group except shopkeepers, and the latter is
numerically only a quarter of the size of the
former.

If the occupations with very small samples
are considered, there are indications that the
‘“‘middle class’? groups—business owners
and managers, salesmen, clerks and professional men—are more fertile in the city than
in the country villages, possibly because they
are more likely to be among their own class
in the former environment and so less subject
to the dysgenic fertility restriction which is
INTELLIGENCE, FERTILITY AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS

somehow associated with sharp awareness of
class differences.

The second part of Table V shows that
most occupations which are dysgenic in the
country are also dysgenic in the town: the
variations in the actual figures are not large
enough to be significant, and the same may
perhaps be said of the two instances—the
unemployed and unskilled factory workers—
which show a difference of sign, being dysgenic in the town and eugenic in the country.

It may be advisable to remind the reader
here that the dysgenic trend for the population as a whole cannot be found by adding
these intra-occupational changes: the calculation must include in its scope also the
greater effect arising from inter-occupational
differences of fertility.

From Table VI it will be seen that the
more selected intelligence characteristic of
the town group as a wholef obtains also for
each occupation separately, except for a
group small in numbers, constituted by shopkeepers, business owners, clerks and professional men in which the rural intelligence
exceeds the urban. The sufficient magnitude
of this difference and the fact that these
groups are also alike in being at the bottom
of _ te fertility scale suggests that this

difference is a significant one. Perhaps in
the country villages, this group constitutes
a more class-conscious minority, marrying
within itself and so maintaining a higher intelligence level in the children by more
assortative mating. The remaining exception
—the unemployed group—stands apart and
is too small in numbers to justify much
dependence on the result. The city, as has
been mentioned,* was very prosperous,
employing practically all employables ; the
country, though also having a low unemployment figure, might have rejected somewhat
abler men, making the group a more intelligent one. Again “unemployment ”’ in the
country, is sometimes a euphemism for other
occupations such as poaching, which may
also partially explain the suspicion of higher
intelligence among children of country unemployed.

The group “ Postmen and Policemen,’’ too
small to justify its introduction in other
tables, is brought into Table VI because of
the special interest which arises from its
presenting a group uniform in town and
country. The intelligence quotient of the
children likewise proves to be uniform. Are
we to conclude that in all other occupations
the standards of intelligence and efficiency
are lower in the country than in the city in
response to the lower wage rates in the
country ? Such aconclusion seems inevitable,
for we cannot account for these differences as
differences in the parent-child regression as
we do in the case of the “ middle class ”’
group, since the groups are too large to permit much assortative mating in relation to
the main body of the population. Sociological
researches comparing occupations must therefore beware of assuming that the same occupation is of comparable standard in town
and country.

This attempt to analyze social factors connected with eugenic and dysgenic trends
will be concluded by treating the results of
Table III in a manner likely to bring out the
causes of the exceptions to the relation of
intelligence and fertility—namely by arranging the fourteen occupations as points on a

graph. The causes associated with exceptions may not, of course, throw light on the
main cause of high status being associated
with low intelligence.

It will be seen that the most aberrant
points on one side of the best fitting line are
farm labourers, sailors, shopkeepers and
clerks ; on the other side, business owners
and farmers. The former have more children
than we should expected from their intelligence, the latter have fewer. The relation
appears between this grouping and the relation of intelligence to earning power given in

If these matters are to be treated in an

accumulation of further data in this field:
at present complete hypotheses would be unstable and premature. But certain generalizations become clear; notably that the

the directions of the differential birthrate correlate more with intelligence and
education than with economic level. The
failure to get any further general relationship
between eugenic tendency and some simple
function of economic status and intelligence
suggests that important factors must lie in
detailed conditions specific to occupations.
This is illustrated again by the fact that
although the decline of family size with
intelligence is on the whole distinctly steeper
for the country than for the town,* the town
is more dysgenic ; because the curve happens
to be slightly steeper at the middle section of
the distribution curve where most cases
occur, and this effect, Table V suggests, may
be largely due to the unskilled factory
workers alone.

MAIN CONCLUSIONS

1. Size of family is negatively related to intelligence within the majority of occupations
studied.

2. The exceptions are occupations with good
intelligence, earning capacity and, especially,
high general standards of education.

3. The strongest dysgenic trend is found in
occupations of intermediate social status.

4. Inter-occupationally, intelligence of children
correlates —o-:84 with size of family and

+0:91 with earning power. The latter correlates —o-78 with size of family. A possible
conclusion is that fertility is a function of
intelligence over and above socio-economic
status.

. Inspection of family size distributions suggest

that there is already operative in this country
a tendency to restrict to a size planned
appropriately to socio-economic conditions
and this size is smaller in occupations of lower
status. This tendency is completely expressed
in the highest occupations but in lower
occupations acts side by side with, without
being totally obscured by, a tendency to
completely haphazard reproduction, and this
latter tendency dominates the lowest groups.

. Children regress to the mean considerably in

relation to their fathers’ I.Q.’s. This regression is more marked in certain occupations,
apparently where socio-economic conditions
affect assortative mating, but with one exception the rank order of intelligence for the
children is the same as that for the fathers,
when arranged in occupational groups.

. Most occupations that are dysgenic in the

town are also dysgenic in the country and viceversa.

. The greater fertility and lower intelligence

which characterizes the country group as a
whole also characterizes rural occupations
singly, but there is a suggestion that if earning
conditions are equally good the occupation
retains its I.Q. level (and probably its low fertility) in the country. The exception is a small
group of “‘ middle class ’’ occupations which
has a higher intelligence and lower fertility
than its equivalent group in the town.
