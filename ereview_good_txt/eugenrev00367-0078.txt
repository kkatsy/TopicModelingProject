Social Chaos and the Way Out, by ALFRED BAKER READ. (Publishers:

would lead either to the extinction of society or of civilisation. The
“way out” may be indicated by a quotation from the contents—
“ Children are not wanted,” “ How infanticide will gradually become a
custom,” “ Willing pioneers,” “ No other means of settling labour
disputes.”
