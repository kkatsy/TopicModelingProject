THE BIRTH RATE CHANGES
Stockholm ‘Upper’ Classes More Fertile Than The ‘ Lower ’

By KARL ARVID EDIN, Ph.D.

HE ‘ upper ’ classes of Greater Stock
holm are now having larger families

than are the ‘ lower.’ This fact is in
striking contrast with the position in London
and, as far as I know, the other great capitals
of the civilized world. Everywhere else
fertility falls steadily as social class rises.
In Stockholm itself it appears to be a comparatively recent change.

I have already given a short preliminary
account* of my researches into the fertility
of marriages in Stockholm in the years
1919-22. It was made by means of birth
gives the results of this research, enlarged
to include the whole of Greater Stockholm
(with nearly half a million inhabitants in
1920).

While the higher fertility of the wealthier
classes is most remarkable in the marriages
contracted during the war, the differences
between the two income groups are statistically significant for all marriages except the
most recently contracted (1919-20).

The reader will also notice how remarkably low is the fertility of all groups in
comparison with that in other countries.

cards (inserted into the Census material of
December 31st, 1920) for those marriages in
which the wife at that date was under forty
and lived with her husband. The details
investigated were the date of marriage, the
professions (Census number), and incomes
both of husband and of wife in 1920, the
dates and places of their own births, and the
number of children born to them. Table 1

* Proceedings of the World Population Conference,
1927. Pp. 205-207. Arnold, 1928.

Indeed, the birth rate (of live births, legitimate and illegitimate) in Stockholm in
those years was:

THE BIRTH RATE CHANGES

The latest figures (for 1927) are 11.2 and
36, respectively. The change in the differential birth rate is not due to rising (or
great) fertility among the wealthy, but
rather to falling fertility among the poor.

A summary investigation for a longer
period, made by the Statistical Office of the
City of Stockholm (in Statistisk Manadsskrift, July, 1928) to check my rather surprising results, substantiated my more
differentiated and detailed investigation for
the limited period.

The Statistical Office made this research
firstly for a part of the city inhabited chiefly
by the wealthier classes, and next for another part inhabited chiefly by the poorer
classes. The fertility of all women (standardized according to the situation throughout the city on January Ist, 1921, in six
age-groups, and for marital condition) is
given in Table 8.

If only legitimate births are counted, the
differences in the earlier years are reduced,
and in the later years are changed in favour
of the wealthier district :

I also calculated separately the fertility of
twelve combined marriage-duration and agegroups among (1) Industrial Workers, and

259

(2) Others. ‘The last class I sub-divided
again into (a) Husbands with a yearly income below 6,000 crowns, (b) With an income of 6-10,000 crowns, and (c) With above
10,000 crowns. The ages of the wives (below
30 years, and 30-40 years) were first combined with those of the husbands (below and
above 35 years), and next with the same
groups of duration of marriage as in Table ].

I then calculated the number of confinements to be expected in (a), (b), and (c), if
their fertility (in each of the twelve subgroups) was the same as that of (1), the industrial workers. In all four age-groups,
and in both the earlier groups of duration
of marriage the calculated number for (b)
and (c) was considerably less than the actual
number. If the fertility of (b) and (c) had
been equal to the fertility of the industrial
workers in each of the twelve groups standardized, the numbers of confinements would
have been 2,154 and 1908. In actual fact
the numbers were 2,528 and 2,784, respectively. In short, the fertility of the wealthiest class in Stockholm (above 10,000 crowns)
was 45 per cent. higher than that of the
industrial workers, the poorest class investigated ; the fertility of the class worth
6-10,000 crowns was 17 per cent. higher,
while the fertility of (b) and (c) combined
was 31 per cent. above expectation.

The excess fertility of Group 2a was insignificant, being only 3 per cent. above that
of 1, a fact which pulls down the fertility
of the whole of Group 2 (a, b and c) to 14.4
per cent. above expectation. I should add
that a small proportion (7 per cent.) of the
industrial workers in Group 1] declared an
income of at least 6,000 crowns.

Table 5 shows the excess fertility of
(2b) and (2c) in the three marriage groups.

The excess of fertility of marriages contracted before 1919 is statistically significant for both groups, and also for the latest
marriages in (2c).

In the groups where the husband is young
(below 35 years) the excess of ‘ standardized ’ fertility over the rates of Group ] is
still more marked—for Class (2c) 51 per
cent., as against 42 per cent. in the groups
where the husband is older. The figure for
260

Class (2b) is 19 per cent., as against 15 per
cent. In those classes where income ordinarily rises with age the excess of fertility in
marriages where the husband has procured
a relatively high income in youth is very
marked.

My next step was to analyze the fertility
of all married couples in the years 1921-22
alone, dividing them up into three social
classes: (1) industrial workers, (2) others
with incomes less than 6,000 crowns, and
(3) those with incomes of at least 6,000
crowns. Besides grouping according to
duration of marriage, I subdivided the wives
into four age-groups—under 25, 25-30, 3035, and 35-40. As before, I calculated the
births to be expected in (3) if fertility was
the same as in (1), and then compared it
with the actual number recorded. ‘Table 6
gives the results.

In this study a reasonable time had
elapsed since the most recent marriages
(1919-20), a fact which accounts for the
more marked difference between Class ] and
Class 8. It should be noted, however, that
all living children, illegitimate as well as
legitimate, born (to the same women) in
I91I9 and 1920, are included in the figures
in Table 5, which raises the fertility of
Class 1. Here, in Table 6, the illegitimate
are excluded. The percentages of excess in
Table 6 are statistically significant for all
three marriage-duration groups. |

For 1920 I had the exact date of marriage
recorded on all family-cards for the city
proper, and also the exact dates of all confinements. Stillborn children were included; and I made a record (again, with
exact dates) of all illegitimate children born
(within nine months before marriage) in
I9Ig and 1920 to women married during
1920. ‘Table 7 gives the results for two
social classes. JI have excluded wives who
had not lived in Stockholm for at least two
years since marriage ; and I have counted as
childless those wives who had had no children within two years after marriage.

Group A consists of wives of industrial
workers or of men with some other indication of profession, who in 1920 stated an
income of less than 6,000 crowns. Group B
consists of wives of men in the ‘ upper’
classes, who in 1920 stated an income of at
least 6,000 crowns.

Here the percentage of confinements is a
little lower among the ‘ upper ’ classes ; but
THE BIRTH RATE CHANGES

it should be noted (1) that the marriages are
very recently contracted (with many of the
children among the lower classes conceived
before marriage); and (2) that the illegitimate confinements are counted as legitimate
if born nine months before marriage—which
raises the figure for the workers. The following Table gives a more detailed study of
the figures obtained :

261

which have produced children in the period
from 9 months before to 24 months after
marriage (no child on the way), there is a
greater proportion of complete sterility
among the ‘lower’ than among the
‘upper ’ classes.

In Table 10a I give the months (from 9 to
24) in which the first confinements after
marriage occurred (same marriages as ana

Here, in just the early years of marriage
of the younger couples, fertility is still a
little higher among the poorer group. But, on
the other hand, Table 9 indicates that if
one compares childless marriages with those

in Class B 65 per cent. I dare not say
whether or not these figures can be taken as
supporting Professor Gini’s hypothesis*
that there is a physiological half-sterility
(‘‘ weakening of genetic instincts ’’) which
follows a voluntary limitation of births.

THE BIRTH RATE CHANGES

Lastly, I extracted the family cards for
all marriages contracted in 1916, and I
noted the years of birth of all children who,
born between 1914-1918, could fairly be
assumed to be the children of those wives,
either before or after marriage. (The actual
days of birth are given of all children born
in I919-22, even if they died before the
Census, and so are those of the children who
were born in 1916-18 and died in 1919-22.)
The greater richness in children in the
‘upper ’ classes appears very clearly here :

263

1914-15) and those with the most in the
second half-period (1919-22). |

Ilegimate children are included here. If
they are omitted, the A and B percentage
rises to 57, C to 92. The figures suggest
that the greater numbers of confinements
in the ‘upper’ classes are more evenly
spread over the time of observation than are
the smaller numbers in the ‘ lower ’ classes,
which are more concentrated in the first
years—many, probably, before the ninth
month after marriage.

The fact that the income of the husbands
of the ‘ upper ’ classes generally rises more
with rising age than does the income of the
‘lower’ class husbands, is probably an
inducement to a more even distribution of
births. They tend to postpone family burdens until they are richer ; but the working
class would rather prefer to shoulder the
burdens while they can, during youth and
good wages. Figures illustrating this fact
are given in Table 18.

The employment of women is another factor which appears to have great influence
upon fertility. Table 14 shows the amount
of employment among the four incomeclasses of Table 18. In Table 15 I give
the actual numbers of children born to (a)
the unemployed wives, and (b) the employed
in each of the same four classes, and compare them with the ‘ expected’ numbers—
i.e., the fertility of all classes combined,
represented as roo. Only Class D, the
wealthiest, is not sub-divided into unemployed and employed wives, because the
difference between the two is negligible.
Their combined fertility is the highest of
all above expectation. In classes A and B

the fertility of the employed is little more
than half expectation or than half of that of
the unemployed wives in the same classes.
In Class C (6,000-10,000 crowns) the fertility of the employed is nearly 30 per cent.
below expectation, and that of the unemployed 10 per cent. above. All rates have
been standardized according to the twelve
marriage-duration and age-groups mentioned
at the bottom of column 1, page 259.
I regret that without prolonged further
analysis of my material I cannot give the
number of wives. But their total years of
marriage, as given in the Tables, answer the
purpose sufficiently well.

Iu Table 16 (above) I have given the fertility standardized in the same way for each
marriage-duration group. The rise in
fertility of the ‘ upper ’ class marriages con
tracted during the war is especially noticeable.

In conclusion, to prevent misunderstandings, I give a brief account of the methods
of the Swedish Census, especially of the
Census of Stockholm in 1920, of the use
which I have made of the data, and of my
Method of Identification.
266

The Swedish Census is founded (at least
since 1860), on the continuous registering
(by the clergy) of the births, deaths, marriages, and migrations (including all migrations between the parishes) in a special
church-book (‘‘ forsamlingsboken,’’ the
Parish Register). For the last Census of
1920 this material is supplied with the declarations of income of each inhabitant.
These declarations are identified and inserted in the ordinary Census material. In
Stockholm, we have no parish registers, but
only lists of taxpayers (‘‘ mantalslangderna ’’). These are also checked with the
help of the registers of migration. (See
League of Nations’ Statistical Handbooks,
Series No. 6, page 20.)

For each marriage, where the woman was
aged below forty years at the date of the
Census (December 31st, 1920) and lived with

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

her husband in Stockholm at that date, T
have extracted a family-card, and for each
confinement in these marriages during the
years 1919-22 a birth-card. The latter
returns I have identified and inserted in the
family cards. For the years 1921-22 I have
also noted the migrations from Greater
Stockholm of all such couples registered on
family-cards, and also all deaths and
divorces (taken from the respective registers); and inserted them in my family-cards.
Thus, the space of time of observation
(years of marriage) is perfectly correct. I
have succeeded in identifying practically
all confinements on my family-cards. I
belteve that this method of identification is
the only rational method for investigations
on the differential ferttlity of the income
and social classes.
