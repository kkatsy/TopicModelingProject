The Ageing of the British Population

SOME

HE GROWTH OF the British population,

and its causes, are fairly well known but

the concept of ageing, the manner in

which this has occurred and the prospects for

future developments in this respect are less
widely appreciated.

In the following table, the proportions of the
British population in various broad age-groups
are measured at intervals over the period
1851-1951:

AGE LAST

BIRTHDAY 1851 1871 1891 1911 1931 1951
vo 7 % Yo % %

The population in which the age-distribution
is illustrated grew from 21 million in 1851
steadily to 49 million in 1951, and its increase
was attributable to improvements in mortality,
offset in the later part of the period by falling
fertility. Its age-distribution, on the other hand,
remained virtually constant from 1851 to 1891
(and had probably done so since the beginning

FACTS

mortality alone was declining, no appreciable
change in age-distribution occurred.

What of the future? According to the latest
official population projection, the population
of Britain is to be expected to increase from its
present level of 53 million to 72 million in the
year 2002. Its age-distribution over this period
will develop as follows, if the forecast is realized:

AGE LAST

% % %

0-14 23 25 26
15-29 20 21 22

45-59 20 16 16
60-74 13 14 11
75 and over 4 5 5
Total 100 100 100

The expectations during this period are of a
further fall in mortality but a rise in fertility—
neither very marked in extent. The age-distribution is likely to be slightly younger at the end
than it is at the present time, but the difference
is not substantial.

We thus have three periods, the principal
characteristics of which may be summarized
as follows:

PERIOD POPULATION AGE-DISTRIBUTION MORTALITY FERTILITY
Up to 1891 Rising Constant Falling Constant
1891-1951 Rising Getting much older Falling Falling sharply
1951-2000 Rising Becoming slightly younger Falling Rising slightly

of the century). Thereafter, the proportion of
people under age thirty fell from 63 to 42 per
cent, and the proportion over forty-five rose
from 18 to 36 per cent. This, taken as a whole,
is the phenomenon of ageing and the period over
which it occurred coincided with a period during
which mortality and fertility fell. Earlier, while

From this statement it is apparent that there
is at least a superficial connection between
fertility trends and age-distribution, but the
contribution of mortality seems to be relatively
unimportant.

To ascertain whether the ageing of the British
population—or some other population, for it

181
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

has been a common occurrence in Western
countries over the last hundred years—is
attributable to mortality changes, or to fertility
changes, to some combination of the two,
or even to neither but migration instead, is no
mere academic exercise. It is important as a
measure of the significance of certain elements
in our social progress. For instance, if by
prolonging life the doctors have made us old and
ineffective as a nation, it might be argued that
the resources devoted to medical progress should
be reduced. If on the other hand fertility needs
encouraging in order to keep the nation young
and vigorous, some would hold that more
money should be devoted to the provision of
family allowances.

In his 1962 Darwin lecture, published in THE
EuGENICS Review for April, 1963, Professor
Parkes stated that the ageing of our population
‘is becoming a major social problem and one
for which medical science, in the widest sense,
is directly responsible.”

It is, of course, obvious that, in general, the
activity of the doctors in producing improvements in longevity must lead to an older population. The question is, how potent are the effects ?
Much will depend on the ages at which the
improvement occurs: a reduction in early childhood alone—say from 10 per cent to 2 per
cent at age 0—will have nearly the same effect
as an increase in fertility, in the case cited, by
8 per cent; this alone would lead to a younger
age-distribution. A reduction in the death rate
confined to ages over seventy would affect the
age-distribution only a little, as relatively few
persons survive to the oldest ages, but would
make the population just a little older.

It is tempting to compare the different English
Life Tables in order to measure the influence
of mortality upon age-distribution. Thus, for
instance, according to English Life Table No. 3,
relating to a hundred years ago, the proportion
of persons of both sexes over age sixty-five was
about 9 per cent, whereas according to the latest
corresponding Table to-day (No. 11) the proportion is 14 per cent. Unfortunately, however,
there is a fallacy in this comparison. It is not
valid because the levels of fertility required to
keep the population stationary are not the same

182

in each case. The fertility that maintained the
1860 life table population in a stationary state
would support a growing population in 1960,
in which the proportion of persons age sixty-five
and over would in fact be only about 9 per cent.
Thus a fall in the death rate of as much as from
2°4 per cent to 1-5 per cent has had little effect
upon the age-distribution.

There is, in fact, only one way in which a
proper measurement can be made of the relative
contributions of mortality and fertility to the
change in the age-distribution of the population
and that is to work out, in full detail, what would
have happened if matters had developed in
various ways. It has thus been calculated that if
fertility had not fallen since 1870 in Great
Britain, but had remained at its mid-Victorian
level, we should now have over 100 million
people alive in this country, of whom 5 million
would be aged over sixty-five. This proportion
of the aged (5 per cent) is about the same as in
1870, in spite of all the mortality improvements
that have taken place since then. The actual
proportion today is 12 per cent, and the rise
from 5 per cent is nearly all attributable to
changes in fertility. Persons aged sixty-five and
over to-day were all born before 1900, when
fertility was still high, whereas the fall in fertility
in this country to one-half its Victorian level
has naturally considerably reduced the relative
numbers of the young.

During the past decade, the researches of
distinguished demographers in _half-a-dozen
or more different Western countries have
demonstrated that increases in the proportion
of older persons there during the past decades
have been a result almost entirely of declines
in the fertility rate and virtually not at all of
declines in the mortality rate. (In the future,
declines in the death rate may well emerge as the
dominant factor in determining the age-distribution, although this is by no means certain.)
In one survey, it was shown that, in a group of
European countries, if fertility had remained at
the pre-1900 level, the median age of the
population would actually have been reduced
in nearly all cases, and the proportion of persons
over sixty-five would have fallen in one-half
of them. (Ansley Coale, in a paper presented to
THE AGEING OF THE BRITISH POPULATION

Fund).
