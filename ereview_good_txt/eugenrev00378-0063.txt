THE ARISTOCRACY OF INFANCY AND THE
CONDITIONS OF ITS BIRTH

By R. J. Ewart, M.D., M.Sc., F.R.C.S., D.P.H.

ARISTOCRACY, according to Plato, is the rule of the best born,
that is, according to conventional definition, those who can trace
an ancestry filling an important office or exercising great influence.
Under this definition it is assumed that all members of a family
are equally endowed at birth with those qualities which have led
to the pre-eminence of their progenitors, or that they are more
likely to inherit such attributes than those of a more humble
stock.

Man will always have an aristocracy, irrespective of the
basis of selection, and inheritance must play an important part
in the choice of such individuals, but the fact that the endowment on each member of a family is indiscriminate and is not
influenced by law is, as I hope to show in this and a succeeding
paper, a wrong conception.

The disrepute into which the hereditary governing class has
fallen in the last decade, is, I think, not due to the natural
degeneration of the breed and loss of prestige, but rather that
the law of selection, namely, the eldest, is not likely to fall upon
the physically and mentally fittest person to carry on the work
and influence of the parent. The intensity, if I may use such a
term, of the transference of parental qualities to the offspring is
governed by certain well defined laws, which, though they may
vary in strength and at times be masked by other factors, still
are always in operation, and that obedience to these laws must
in time lead to the pre-eminence of that stock. At present
we do not mould our customs by them and this is in the main, the
origin of certain changes that are at present imminent and
others that have taken place in our political constitution.

In this paper my intention is to confine myself to the Infant
144 R. J. Ewart:

and the conditions of its birth, but at a future time I intend to
deal with its later life. An initial difficulty immediately arises
as to the meaning of the term ‘“‘best born” as applied to an
immature population. With adults there is no such difficulty, as
by standards of physical development, mental power and vitality,
a meaning to the word ‘‘best’’ can easily be assigned. With
infants a much more subtle problem has to be negotiated. Perhaps
the best criteria that can be taken is the power of survival. I do
not say that a better one is not available, but it has the advantage
of being defined, for nothing can be more definite than death,
and further, such information can be accurately and easily
obtained. Vitality, as measured by power of survival, is, as I
hope to shew in another paper, largely correlated with those
mental and physical attributes, which lead to success under our
modern social system.

The criterion of the term ‘‘ best born ”’ as I intend to use it,
in respect to our infant population, is their power to survive, and
as a measure of that power I shall largely use what is known as
‘‘ Infantile Mortality,” or the number of infants dying in the first
year of life per thousand born during the same year, a figure
which in different parts of the country varies from Ioo to 200 per
1,000 births. Recently there has been presented to us a complete report by the Government containing all that is known
concerning what is rightly described as a ‘‘slaughter amongst the
innocents.” The object of that report and my present purpose
are essentially different, though the material and standards used
are much the same. The underlying principle of humanity is
embodied in it as in all other health material of a similar nature,
namely, the saving and preservation of life irrespective of its
economic value, and at the present time such an ideal must be
ever before us as the brotherhood of man demands it. Apart
from that ideal, there is a feeling in the minds of many, and
even those who constitute our Health Committees, that the great
waste of early human life is not all evil. Anyone taking a broad
view of the efforts that are being made to prevent it could not be
struck either by their sincerity or enthusiasm, but would come to
the conclusion that the question of Infant Mortality was not
taken very seriously, and if one probed further one would almost
THE ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH, ETC. 145

inevitably find that the cause of the indifference largely arises
from the fact that the problem is not understood, even in its
most rudimentary details. Upon perusal of reports either by
the Goverment or municipal bodies one would find there little
beyond elaborate statistical tables, probably supporting such
conclusions as commonsense had already taught us. In fact I
should think that one’s ideas would be very much confused,
for facts would be found that appear to be diametrically
opposed. We are told in the Government Report that Infantile
Mortality can be taken as a safe guide of sanitation or the want
of it, yet in Ireland as a whole, where the sanitary conditions are
not exemplary, the mortality is lower than that for England. Many
other examples could easily be given. If there is one criticism
I would make of all reports bearing on this point, it is the subsidiary and unimportant place given to the mother. She is
mentioned of course, but never, and I think I am right in saying
it, as the predominant factor. The child is looked upon as a
separate unit from the time of its birth, and statistically is treated
as such. A very casual acquaintance of a life table will show
that biologically a child is not an independent individual until
the tenth or eleventh year, when it corresponds to a chick of a
few days’ growth after hatching. I do not wish to criticise the
fallacies into which the sanitary authorities under the guidance
of their experts on occasion drift; they simply form a reflection
of the errors of their parent body when dealing with massed
detail as against individual experience, let it suffice to say that
out of error truth is born.

I propose then to take as the measure of my standard of the
‘“best born” the figure known under the name of Infantile
Mortality. It is not my intention to consider the immediate
cause of the deaths, whether it be measles, whooping cough, or
other disorder, for though these are conditions which account for
over half our deaths at the early ages and are classed as being of
a preventable nature, they are not the true cause of death, but
simply the final act in a played out drama. In my own town,
from which much of my data was collected, a series of events
led to an interesting result. The winter of 1909-10 was mild
with us and epidemic disease was, relatively speaking, scarce.
146 R. J. Ewart:

The infantile death-rates were low. The summer of ig10 was
cold, and diarrhcea was not prevalent. Now, as I hope to shew,
under such conditions a certain type of child had survived, a type
which can be found by the conditions of its birth. Inthe spring
of 1911, measles naturally became very prevalent amongst the
susceptible population that had slowly accumulated, and this
being associated with a severe March, the death-rates rose to
a startling figure, and practically the whole of those immature
and feeble lives that had previously escaped were swept awayalong
with a few of a stronger kind. That this was the case I was
able to verify, and it was through considerations under which the
best are born that much of my information was obtained.
Conclusions, based on immediate causes, attributed these
death-rates to the prevailing epidemic and negligence on the
part of the mothers, but more mature investigation shewed that
measles, or whatever other disease happened to be prevalent,
were mere links 1n a chain of circumstances that could be traced
to a more direct cause. The facts that I propose to consider may
be classed under certain headings. Firstly, as would naturally
occur to one, the age of the parent. It is surprising, and I have
made considerable search, though Iam unable to find any detailed
considerations bearing on this point, which one would naturally
think to be of paramount importance. That births occurring at
the beginning and end of married life are in some way different
from the middle ones has been appreciated I am aware, but that
there is a regular sequence of fitness according to the age of the
parents, is, I believe, a new conception. I first drew attention to
this fact in the Medical Officer in 1910. Dr. John J. Buchan
of St. Helens independently and at a later date drew attention to
the influence of the sequence of birth, to which fact I had also
previously referred and shown that this was mainly an age
influence. A glance at Table I. given at the end will show that
the mortality falls from the beginning of life until the twentyfourth year is reached and then slowly rises again. Under
nineteen years it is 171 and towards the twenty-fourth year it
falls to 130. From some additional figures taken even from a
slum population it fell to below 100. From the twenty-fourth
year it steadily rises until in the class over forty years of age it
THE ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH, ETC. 147

reaches the figure 330. The history of children born of parents
of this age is interesting, though the number of data I possess is
not large, still it appears as if the expectancy of life of a child
born after the forty-third year is not more than twenty-one years.
Now as the object of reproduction is to reproduce, it is mere
waste to give birth to offsprings that will scarcely reach the
reproductive period. At the forty-fifth year, or thereabouts, the
power is lost and the reason of the loss is understandable.

It would be quite feasable to contend that the sequence of
birth was a more potent factor than the age of the parent. In
fact Dr. Newsholme states as his opinion, though he gives no
data on which he bases it, that large families and high deathrates are not associated. It is easy to understand how such a
misconception arises when, as I suppose is the case with Dr.
Newsholme, it is based on the impressions received from our
social and private life. The big families we meet impress us and
the small ones that should have been big are not noticed for the
deaths are not mentioned. I have shewn in Tables III. and IV.,
and Dr. Buchan supports me, that large families and high deathrates go hand-in-hand, but whether this is due to the later births
occurring during the period of the mothers’ decline or are consequent on the exhausting influence of the previous ones, we may
consider at this juncture. The initial birth of any family is
usually not a good one, fortunately for our law of primogeniture
and the principles on which we select our rulers, it is, if the
mother be young, usually a girl. Beyond the factor of age there
Is every reason to believe that the pioneer of a family has much
to overcome that is smooth for those who follow. I find the
death-rate of the initial birth amongst the poor to be over 200 per
1,000 births of that kind. With second births it falls to 116 and
then slowly rises, but irregularly until it reaches a figure
approaching 300 per 1,000 for births of thirteen and over. The
contention that ignorance on the part of the mother may have
some influence may, I think, be disregarded, for in the classunder
consideration go per cent. were fed at the breast for practically
the whole of the first year, though in proportion the greater
number of deaths were amongst those fed artificially. The cause

of this large number of deaths is to be found in the mother
5
148 R. J. Ewart:

herself. The first birth, both on account of the probable age of
the mother and the initial difficulties, of which a prolonged birth is
only one, is in most cases the weakest of the whole family ;
weakest not only physically but often mentally as well. This
fact further is supported by my own observations amongst
defective children and by independent work amongst the insane.
The death-rate is lowest with the second birth and then
steadily rises. This is probably an age influence also, for we
have seen that the mortality is lowest at about the twenty-fourth
year, and the average age at which the second birth occurred in
the mothers under consideration was a little under that year, the
twenty-fifth year being the average for the third from which
point the mortality rises towards both extremes of life. I. do not
think, provided a certain minimum interval is allowed to elapse,
which interval is discussed under the heading of fertility
(Table V.), that any ill effects upon the mother are consequent
upon the previous birth; in fact I have reason to believe the
reverse isthe case. It is well known that a woman enjoys better
health whilst carrying a child than at any other time. The arrest
of phthisis under such conditions is a well appreciated fact.
The influence of the exuberant vitality of the growing embryo in
all probability extends to the mother herself, and should under
normal conditions persist after birth. ‘That some such substances
do persist is proved by the fact that the sex of the previous birth
influences to aslight degree that of the succeeding one (see Table
VII.). Although my data is small still with some hesitation I
state it, that the expectancy of life of women who have borne
children and have maintained a suitable spacing of the births,
at the forty-fifth year is greater than those who have borne no
children at all. Other factors are, of course, at work, such as
the possibility that the better and more physically fit are more
likely to have children. This may be so, but my impression
of the health of married and unmarried women agrees with my
statistical findings, provided that temperance in sex indulgence
has been exhibited.
_ Another interesting series of data is furnished by the possibility of accident, either at or preceding birth, and lends support
to the theory of a strong age influence. It shews firstly the
THE ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH, ETC. I49

importance of adequate spacing, and secondly as the age advances,
the increased tendency to miscarry (see Table V.). We may
assume from the distribution of the number of accidents according to age that there is no alteration in the vitality of the mother
to account for the loss of the initial birth of a series as already
noted, and that the high death rate distinguishing it from the
others must depend on circumstances associated with the nurture
and process of the birth itself.

Beyond this age influence there does appear to be one factor
strongly predisposing to mishap and even affecting the future
development of the child, and this leads to the consideration
of the factors governing fertility, or perhaps fecundity is a more
suitable word to express the process I wish to discuss. In this
connection two groups of data are required (1) the number of
mothers at risk at each age, and (2) the number of births occurring
in the following year.

To take the number of women married as a standard is open
to a serious objection, as it is well known that in a large proportion of our population, marriage follows and does not precede
the impregnation for the initial birth. A much better series of
data can be obtained. To have a second birth a first must have
preceded it. Now we can easily find for any population the
age at which the first birth occurred and thus the number
of women at risk for a second or subsequent one, and hence
by noting the actual number occurring we can calculate the
probability of conception. It is seen from Table VII. that this
probability rises to between the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth
years. ‘‘ Duncan quoted from Marshall (Phystology of Reproduction) gives the thirtieth year’’ and then steadily falls again.
It 1s interesting to note that the greatest fertility is at the middle
of that period when we expect the best to be born.

Another method was used (see Table VIII.) amongst the
better class people, and the results are mainly confirmatory of
the figures I already have given. In this series the mothers
were asked to give the time that had elapsed since the previous
birth, their ages also being noted, and the figures are as follows.
For the period under 20 it is under two years. During tbe
following five years it reaches its lowest point, and then for each
150 R. J. Ewart:

quinquenniad it rises until after the fortieth year when the
interval is under four years. To say that there should be a
stated and uniform interval between each child is therefore not
true, unless the age of the mother be considered. The period of
rest necessary varies according to the age and capabilities of the
mother, and roughly speaking, natural physiological processes
have decided at what times re-impregnation shall take place.

There is no definite line or point at which these capabilities
are decided, and the fate of a fertilised ovum is dependent on
conflicting and fluctuating influences. The figures and data in
this connection that I have collected do not shew any very
regular sequence when considered in the light of one factor.
Age, for example, gives evidence of a pre-disposing tendency,
but it is not regular enough to exclude others. I admit that
information on a question of this nature is not very reliable as it
depends solely on the correct interpretation of certain events in
the history of the mother, and I am aware that many women,
especially in the class from whom I have collected most of my
data, are really not cognisant as to what hash appened. The
onset of the cestrous cycle, and one of no unfrequent occurrence
after a confinement, begins with a miscarriage though the correct
significance is not assigned to it.

It seems as if the period of recovery after birth can be
divided roughly into epochs. (Marshall, zdsd.) Firstly, there
is a period, during which the reproductive functions are in total
abeyance and during which ovulation does not occur; this period
is one of months only. Ovulation begins before recovery is
quite complete and much before lactation is over or even the reestablishment of the oestrum. Fertilisation may now occur, and
the fertilised ovum may graft and form attachments, such attachments, however, are very weak and are easily broken, so that
miscarriage is a common event. This period might be given as
from the fourth to the eighth month for a normal woman at her
best, the period varies according to the age. The next stage is
one during which birth is a probability following fertilisation,
though the infant when born is feeble and weakly, and even
though it may live and attain some physical robustness, it never
will reach that excellence that would have been possible.
THE ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH, ETC. I5I

The third period might be limited, roughly of course, as
extending from the eighth month to the end of the first year,
according to the age of the mother. Thus we may safely say
with an average women at her best and most fertile period to
achieve the highest possible development for the child, the
interval of birth should be at least two years, this interval being
varied according to the age. Too much importance cannot be
laid on this matter of adequate spacing as I am fully convinced
that most of the maternal troubles arise from errors in this
respect. The education of our children in the powers of mastery
over self and a few hints as to the direction of their efforts in
later life, will be the main factor in removing this stigma of
modern civilisation. I have not much faith in the direct result
of improved sanitation except in so far as it affects the mother
herself and makes her a physically and mentally superior person.

The deaths amongst males are greater than amongst females,
but whether this is dependent on the sex itself or the mature
years at which males are born, is a matter of some doubt. The
impression one gets is that the difference is due to sex alone, and
certainly in some few enquiries into death-rates of boys and girls
born at the later years of life, the figures are against the males.
As they only constitute a little over 100 I give them for what they
are worth. For males the rate for children born between the
thirtieth to fortieth year was 184 per 1,000, and for females 160.

Before I leave the question of age it would be scarcely
considered complete unless some reference were made to the
question of sex. I do not wish to enter into this interesting
problem. All that is known pertaining thereto will be found in
Dr. Marshall’s book. I wish to revive, however, in a modified
form, some of the theories that have been formulated previously,
and further shew how they offer the most reasonable explanation
to certain changes in our own population. A glance at Table
IX., shews at once that the twenty-seventh year in the
mother and at the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth year of the
father a subtle change takes place. Previous to these ages the
tendency was to give birth to girls in a degree varying with
the age, but after that period it is reversed. The relative male
preponderance however is much greater in the later period than the
152 R. J. Ewart:

female in the earlier. Bearing in mind the greater mortality at
later years and the greater death-rate amongst the males, with the
fact that in the population under consideration more than half the
births occured before the thirtieth year, the relative equality of
the sexes is understood. Beyond this the point has some scientific value for it shews that sex is not a fixed quanitity and can
be influenced by factors acting from without. The influence,
moreover, of one birth on the sex of the next (see Table X.), and
the relationship of the sex on the interval of time to the next
impregnation, shew that substances derived from the foetus
persist after birth and influence the succeeding one.

Upon reference to the tables (No. VII., et sequa), it will
be seen that sex is more likely to alternate than follow a
sequence, and further, the interval is shorter after a boy than
after a girl. Bearing this in mind it is possible to form some
idea of the phenomena which underlie the decision of sex. No
individual is wholly male or female, each have some rudiments,
especially anatomical, of peculiarities pertaining to the opposite
kind. Further than that we know that removal of the essential
organs during the period of growth leads to the development of
superficial characters, by which the other sex is distinguished.
Hence we may assume that predominant or actual sex is inhibitory towards the recessive, or such attributes as distinguish it.
Dr. Marshall does not Jay much stress on this point. Embryology—the study of our pre-natal growth—teaches us that we, as
individuals, recapitulate the essential features of the growth and
development of our race, or to express it shortly Ontogeny follows
the path of Phylogeny, making, however, frequent short cuts.
Ontogeny is straight, whilst Phylogeny is tortuous. Now we
know by this law that to begin with, all organisms are without
differentiated sex, then bisexual or hermaphrodite, and finally
unisexual, and there can be no doubt that a fertilised human
ovum has in the first instance no idea of distinctive sex at all.
It may be that actually the influences are predetermined, but
officially, if I may use such a term in this connection, it cannot
be the case.

Now whilst passing through those stages in our pre-natal
existence that resemble those forms of life to which the lower
THE ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH, ETC. 153

worms are allied, dating to before the origin of the back-bone
(Invertebrata) it nominally is on the path to become bisexual.
Now should either sex influence be stronger than the other, it
inhibits the opposite without completely destroying the
fundamental characteristics of that kind, modifying thereby the
subsequent development. We must suppose that every ovum or
sperm is not wholly male or female, but only predominantly so
(see Marshall, ¢dsd.) and that in the union of two such there is a
relative sex predominance.

As these factors must depend on some chemical or other
combinations mass influence must be considered, and it is
impossible to imagine that the maleness of a sperm would be
under all conditions exactly equal to the femaleness of an ovum,
and hence a chance factor would determine the path that the
organism would subsequently follow. If the difference is
relatively large then no outside condition can alter its fate, and
in such a combination though the sex be nominally not
determined at fertilisation it really is. In a certain number the
margin of difference of maleness and femaleness would be small,
and in these, external conditions which may arise from age,
nutrition, psychical conditions, and almost anything in fact that
influences the mother, may turn the balance or accentuate the
difference and thus decide the sex.

At times, in man rarely, but in lower animals more frequently,
especially the Amphibia, the balance is maintained and neither
male nor female obtains the upper hand, and through the want
of decision arising thereby, the changes in the sexual organs do
not occur in synchronism with the rest of the bodily development.
All sorts of abnormalities are thus produced. True Hermaphrodites are practically unknown in man. They probably die before
the time of birth. (An examination of miscarriages will shew on
occasion certain conditions which rather support this view.)
Cases, however, where the decision of sex has been arrived at too
late to produce the necessary modifications of structure are by
no means uncommon and the attempts subsequently made to
remedy the error produce at birth most extraordinary conditions.
(Pseudo-Hermaphroditism.) .

The sexes then may be looked upon as physiologically
antagonistic, and sociologically attractive, and this character
154 R. J. Ewart:

though nominally not determined at impregnation, in the majority
of instances it really is. In a relatively small number (about onesixth of the whole) it depends on external influences.

There are two aspects to discuss which I might digress
from the argument and these are firstly, the origin of morality,
and secondly, the relationship of the aforementioned fact to
certain changes in the numerical sex constitution of our population. Practically in the whole of the vertebrata the sexes are
produced in about equal quantities, and there 1s some evidence
to believe that influences from without do affect this balance,
though they do not appear to form any part in the maintenance
of any particular breed. It must, however, be said that every
factor that has been claimed to be a determinant has subsequently
been denied by other observers. From the point of view of
utility and to make the most use of the males an excess of females
would be desirable, yet we do not see this evolution occurring in
any of the great divisions of the higher mammals.

Sex, as we have shewn, is in the main a chance determination and its modification appears to be incompatible with any
particular end in view, hence we find as we ascend the developmentaltree an adaption being made to this characteristic. Amongst
the lower animals many of the males are wasted from the point
of view of reproduction. In the birds and mammals we see the
males being more or less utilised in the care of the young and
thus allowing of a more immature birth and greater post-natal
development. In these animals mating for the season or until
the young are mature is the rule.

This chance determination of numerical sex equality thus becomes an integral factor in the survival of that particular breed
or kind. Now man differs from all other animals in the fact that
the female under normal conditions conceives for a second before
the first is mature and capable of independent life. Therefore
mating in the interest of the young must be for the whole
reproductive period of life, as at no period of time can the male
be said to be sociologically free of the female. It thus happens
that the instinct which we call morality is an evolution in the
interest of the young which is inherent in our being. It does
not depend on teaching and would develop irrespective of any
THE ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH, ETC. 155

religious or other sentiment. The numerical balance becomes of
great importance, greater to ourselves than in any other class of
animal.

Our communal instinct, which may be regarded as a
development of the moral, brings about the formation of what is
known as ‘‘race,”’ the maintenance of which depends on the
rapid rectification of the sex balance when disturbed through any
cause. We thus find those species of mankind ‘predominant
where the rectification of disturbances in population, either
through war or famine, had been most quickly re-established, or
in other words, in those breeds in which the influences we have
already discussed are best developed. So it happens, what is
always the case in phylogenetic development, a chance factor
produces an accommodation which eventually forms an integral
part of survival.

We may assume that the extrinsic conditions modifying sex
are more marked in man than in any other kind, and consequently
are best studied in him. Further assuming the truth that age
modifies sex, a little thought will show how the laws of supply
and demand will produce a self-regulating mechanism through
the mean age at which mating will occur. Thus with a male
excess the demand for females will be great, and hence all
females will mate early with the stronger and more mature males.
Should the reverse be the case then we will find that all the males
will be made use of. The regulating factor, however, will in all
probability rest mainly with the female as even in man the male
is still somewhat gregarious.

In the last Report of the Registrar-General (Ig09) certain
tables appear which have given rise to much speculation. It has
been felt that an advance in our knowledge would be achieved
could an adequate explanation be given to the changes that are
occurring in the sex constitution, and mean age at marriage, of
our population. Without giving full details, which will be found
in the above-mentioned report, the facts are briefly as follows :—
The relationship between the male and female births is gradually
altering. From 1841 to 1850 the ratio was 1,044 males per 1,000
females. Previously the males had risen to 1,052. From 1850
to 1900 there is a continuous drop to 1,036 males per 1,000
156 R. J. Ewart:

females born. In rgor there is a slight rise to 1,037, but from
then up to the present time it has fallen steadily, being now 1,033
males per 1,000 females. It is curious that this rise, occurring
in the year 1900, was concurrent with a disturbance of the
marriage rate in the previous quinquennium, so that if we bear
in mind the mean age at marriage at this time when considering
the sex of the births three or four years later, we see at once
there is a direct relationship between the two factors. Age at
marriage, however, is not the sole cause underlying the time at
which the birth will occur. Our birth-rate is falling we know,
but so also is that for the whole of Western Europe, with France
heading the list and Russia bringing up the rear. On the other
hand, in Japan the birth rate is rising and has increased in the
last twenty-five years from 25°8 to 33°9 per 1,000 of the population. Beyond this the sex constitution of all these great
communities has altered in direct relationship to the birth-rate.

In those countries where the birth rate is declining, as in
our own, females are relatively increasing, whilst in those where
the rate has an upward trend, the male ratio is becoming greater.
Accompanying this general alteration in the sex relationship of
the countries of Western Europe, there is also noticed in alla
change in the mean age at marriage. With ourselves it has
advanced six months in twenty-five years, though in all probability it is really greater than officially given, partly owing to the
decrease in illegitimacy and also to more correct age registration.
Bearing in mind the table I have given at the end, the tendency
of the marriage age to advance and hence the time at which the
children are born, would be to produce a greater excess of males
and thus neutralise the female preponderance already existent.

In savage man there is no doubt that the mechanism of
regulation of sex balance would follow these lines. In civilised
man, however, a new factor has been added, partly through a
natural development no doubt but also through the rise in
elementary education, which has spread throughout Europe since
the time of Pestalozzi, in 1824, and the cultivation of what I may
term ‘‘ the power of self-inhibition.”

Dr. Newsholme and Mr. Stevenson shewed in a paper before
the Statistical Society that the fall in our birth-rate was due to
THE ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH, ETC. 157

the loss of births in the later years and there is no doubt that
this is true. They and a certain Ecclesiastical Dignitary of the
Established Church attributed this to certain artificial methods
adopted by the parents. This I doubt. I am of the opinion
that education and the establishment of other mental pleasures
and a general desire to control our passions have been, and are
sufficiently strong to inhibit to a considerable extent, sexual
desire in later life. The women are moreover less inclined to
undergo the repeated ordeals of birth.

It is a curious nemesis that the reluctance of the mothers to
bear children at these years when the males preponderate, should
in course of time produce a difficulty in the supply of suitable
mates for their daughters. At the present time many are compelled to forego marriage or seek a mate of a lower social grade.
In this way civilisation has undermined the operation of a
natural law, and a new social accommodation has had to be
devised which we see in evolution at the present time, namely,
the employment of women in labour for the weal of the state,
other than the reproduction and care of the young. Whether
it would not be better if she were employed in these spheres,
for which she is specialised yet remains to be seen. If not then
this race will be over-run by some other which has evolved a
better economy. If it is so then will the community continue
to prosper and maintain its position.

To return to our theme, two headings still require some
notice. Firstly, psychological factors, as judged by illegitimacy
as a standard, and secondly, the contentious field of environment.
Illegitimacy offers several points of interest and the crude rate as.
is usually given, affords very little data for analysis. In the
present enquiry the ages of the mothers, sequence, sex and deaths
in the first year, were noted (see Tables XI. and XII.). Now
every mother must have a first birth, and though in the population under consideration, which lived in the poorer quarter of
this town, the rate was 14 per 1,000 births, when we considered
first births only it rose to 47 per 1,000 births, which gives a
much more accurate idea of the morality of the mother. Thus
‘in 5 per cent., a large percentage of the women had disobeyed
the primeval instinct of morality. It is interesting to note that
158 R. J. Ewart:

the age at which illegitimacy occurs, are the younger years, and
that the distribution is not normal. There are too many at ages
over 30 and under 25 and too few between 25 and 30.

There is much reason to believe that young women, after
an illegitimate first birth eventually get married. Apparently this
happened to over 50 per cent. The rise in later years, that is
after 30, may be due to desertion by the legitimate husband or
his death, the deserted wife or widow living with some man as
his housekeeper. The ratio of first legitimate births to the rest
is about r to 6, and illegitimate x to 3. This, as I have said,
arises partly from the fact of the. ultimate marriage of the
mother and also possibly to certain diseases the maintenance
of which depends on promiscuous intercouse and which are a
frequent source of sterility. The true prostitute is essentially
a degenerate and either through acquired disease, or want of
fertility is a type that is constantly tending to die out, if left to
herself and not nurtured in Workhouses.

Turning now to the death-rates in the first year amongst
these two types of infants we notice great differences, for all
legitimate births the rate is seen to be 170 and with the illegitimate 210. If, however, we confine ourselves to first births only,
the rates are 246 and 400, an enormous figure; an eventuality,
however, with which one cannot help but sympathise and which
no doubt is a factor in the ultimate marriage of the mother.
The feeding of the children differed a good deal (Table XIII),
25 per cent. of the illegitimates were artificially fed, and of these
a little under one-fourth died in the first year. Three per cent.
ef the legitimates were similarly fed, and of these a little
over one-fourth also died in the first year. The ages of the
mothers of these two classes of children are not the same, being
lower with the illegitimates, so that where artificial feeding is
ence established the care they afterwards obtain appears to be
much the same, nor does there seem to be any disparity in the
gift of life that each receive at birth.

With those fed normally the death-rate is greater amongst
the illegitimates. With legitimates it is eight per cent., but with
the former it is a little over twenty per cent. The data from
which these findings were obtained were not very numerous,
THE ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH, ETC. 159

still I think we can assume that taking all things into consideration, the illegitimate birth is not a good one, and eugenically its
early decease is scarcely to be regretted. It is interesting to
note the close similarity between illegitimacy and female excess
in any population. A comparison between the rates for country
and urban areas bears this out. In my own town, witha population accustomed to very heavy work, the rate 1s remarkably
low. ‘There is, however, a male excess at marriageable ages, and
practically any woman can find a mate. The influence of this is
good and has a very beneficial effect on social life, tending
to prevent disturbances in trade. The underlying reason is
obvious.

We now come to the last of our series of considerations
influencing the birth of the best and its chance of survival,
namely, environment. This term is naturally very vague and is
never used in exactly the same sense by any two observers, yet
we read some very dogmatic statements as to its influence on
immature life. Nothing can be more obvious, though with some
glaring and important exceptions, than the association between
the high infantile mortality rate, and what is usually spoken of
as ‘‘slum property.” From this association most experts, those
employed by the Government included, have deduced the fact
that they are cause and effect.

Working as I have done with the people themselves my
feeling is that though these two conditions are frequently
associated the influence is not so direct as we are led to suppose.
It does appear as if certain mental traits of character desire and
seek certain surroundings, and it is those mental attributes which
choose a slum as a place of abode that are really responsible for
the correlation we observe. The contention that there is no
choice on the part of this section of our population has not the
amount of truth in it that some would have us believe. As
sentient beings we can modify our environment, and it is just
that attempt at modification that is wanting, and generally the
denizens of this class of property, giving this meaning to environment, are living below the stimulus of their needs, and would
fall to an even greater condition of degradation, did the local
authorities allow.
160 R. J. Ewart:

It is this want of effort to create an environment of a kind
that is the common cause of slum areas and high infantile rates.
There is nothing so likely to test the power of effort of a mother
as the care of an infant. It is in this crucial test that they shew
their mental and physical unfitness for the task they are called
upon to perform. Of course, mental and physical characteristics
react on surroundings, and surroundings react back again on
the individual, and in such a medley of cross influences it is hard
to say which is paramount and to give the amount of their
relative value, indeed the needs of each case will vary.

The amount of energy and effort necessary might easily be
negotiated by women with, say, two children, the stimulus of her
needs being able to bring forth the proper response. But
supposing the needs were increased to, say, four children
and her strength and mental abilities were insufficient to meet
the new demand, she would then be in the position of a typical
slum dweller, whose chief characteristic is that the stimulus of
her environment does not create sufficient energy to meet her
needs. This criteria is not a fixed one and may oscillate to and
fro, either through financial reasons or conditions of health.
Mr. Rowntree in his account of town life gives a curve of the
rise and fall of a man living under poor conditions above and
below the poverty line. He shews that it is from the twentyfifth to the forty-fifth year when the needs are most and have
risen out of all ratio of his ability to supply them. .

It is upon those who are not responding in the way I have
mentioned that infantile mortality falls with a heavy hand. To
shew statistically, a subtle factor of this kind is almost impossible,
but to give some idea of its influence one can adopt a method,’
though much criticised, which will, I think, suit our purpose, especially if the detail obtained is sufficiently reliable. The method is
to classify the population under consideration into the number of
rooms occupied by each unit, and to trace their subsequent
history.

A reference to Tables XIV. and XV. will shew that the relationship between the needs of a family, and the capability of the
mother to supply them, is under the greatest strain in the fourroomed tenement. The death-rate in the one-roomed tenement
THE ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH, ETC. 161

is the highest, reaching the figure 200 deaths per 1,000 births in
the first year. This figure includes the majority of deaths
amongst illegitimate children and a large proportion of the first
births but with these excluded it would fallto below1so. Taking
this view, which I think is the correct one, the statistical findings
agree with what observation tends to teach. Actually, though
figures do not indicate it, overcrowding is much worse in a fourroomed tenement than in one of any other size. This would be
shewn better perhaps if we deducted from our figures the number
of rooms used as a scullery or kitchen, or for other domestic
purposes.

If we consider initial births only (Table XVI.) the same
sequence is observed, that excepting one-rouined tenements, the
heaviest incidence falls on the four-roomed house. The latter
figures are very small and too much significance must not be
attached to them. They are also complicated by the fact that
although the birth was an initial one, the mother was a lodger,
and hence the same conditions as to overcrowding apply. The
physique of the child at birth as judged by its height and weight
is of some interest (see Table XVII.) Ina little over 200 cases,
which were obtained with some difficulty, it was seen that as the
mother increased in age and occupied a larger tenement the
children increased in height. The weight also increased absolutely, but relatively there is a decrease with those living in the
four-roomed tenements. The antagonistic influence met with in
a larger house seems to have had a detrimental effect on the
nutrition of the child, which should have been bigger and heavier
at the 29th year, the average age of the mother in such a group.

These figures are, however, small and are only of value in
so far as they tend to support the present line of argument.
The economic position of the unskilled labourers, and this section
of my enquiry was made with particular reference to them, is
peculiar. The wage they ask for as a class, and which of course
they receive, is barely sufficient for a man and wife to live on and
leave sufficient offspring behind them suitably trained and of a
physical efficiency to take their place. To a young man this is
ample, but for an elderly one witha large family, it is not enough,
nor does it even meet the needs of the average family of five.
162 R. J. Ewart:

It is at this time when their needs are in excess of their
abilities to supply them that evervthing tells against the mother,
and the essential conditions of a slum household become
established. Such a state of affairs will be found scattered
throughout any community, though in certain areas it would be
more concentrated than in others. We wrongly attribute our
death-rate to the concentration, rather than its cause. The
method of attack is scarcely at the first sight rational, but its
ultimate result is good. Local Authorities increase the needs of
the man by insisting on his occupying a larger and better house
which must cost more. The worker is probably unable to supply
the demand and the household duties are more than the
enfeebled physique and depleted mental condition of the wife
can cope with. This principle drives some completely under,
the struggle is given up and they put themselves upon the community for support. With the majority the establishment of
this minimum standard of decency, which increases the needs of
the individual, is to make him ask for more and use greater effort
to obtain it. By using our power to compel or induce this class
of people to improve their conditions and thus increase their
needs we hope to create an additional strength to meet the
demand, and an adaptability to circumstances that formerly with
them did not exist.

The crude association of environment and death-rate is to
my mind very misleading, and unless considered on the lines I
have laid down, cannot be of much use to support or modify
Local Government. The Infantile rate of any community may
vary from time to time and even considerable differences will be
noticed in other towns living under similar conditions, and the
nature of the manhood produced would have a certain correspondence with infancy. Selection is more potent in those wherein the
death-rate is highest, and further, the contention that children
surviving to later life are marred by their struggle in early years,
is not borne out by actual observation. One finds that actual
defects are more prevalent amongst those living under so-called
good conditions than in those living in bad environment. It
does seem that we have here the survival of the most hardy and
hence those endowed with the greatest vitality. Race must of
THE ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH, ETC. 163

course have some influence in a problem of this nature, but at
present we possess no reliable data on which any conclusions
can be based, though it seems as if the mortality of the North of
England was greater than that of the South. The general
characters of this broad classification as applied to adults is
well-known.

CONCLUSIONS.

We may summarise in the following way :

The age of parent predominates, rising as we have seen to a
maximum and then slowly falling.

The interval of birth is most important, varying mainly
according to age and also modified by other conditions.

The sequence of birth is of importance as regards the first,
but subsequently it is of minor influence. Psychical conditions
and sentiment have a place as is shewn by the fate of illegitimates.

Environment directly is a minor cause but indirectly, as
judged by the needs and the capacity to fulfil them it approaches
the significance of age.

Lastly any conclusions based on the changes of infantile
mortality alone, irrespective of the mother, must from their very
nature be valueless.
