The Population of
the United States of America

Recent Developments Compared with Trends
in Britain

SOME FACTS

REFERENCE HAS BEEN made from time to
time in the pages of the Review to the fact
that in the USA the average family size and
rate of population growth are higher than in
Britain. Very broadly, across the Atlantic they
have three children in the family, whereas the
average married couple here now have 24. On
the thesis that two children are needed for
replacement purposes, the American rate of
population increase should be about 14 per
cent per annum, and that in Britain should be
3 per cent, or about one-half of the US figure.
This simple statement is, however, subject to
modification in the light of certain demographic
complications.

In fact, during the ten years from mid-1953
to mid-1963, the numbers of persons in the
USA grew steadily from 160 million to nearly
190 million, or at about 1# per cent per
annum; the population of Great Britain increased in the same period from 494 million
to nearly 524 million, or only at about 4 per cent
per annum. The ratio of British to American
population thus declined from 31 per cent to
28 per cent in the decade—a fall of one-tenth
in the proportion.

When the French and English populations
were compared, in the October 1964 issue of
the REVIEW, it was shown that their agedistributions are fairly similar. The same does
not hold on both sides of the Atlantic, as the
following figures show:

45-64 20 25

Total 100 100

As a consequence, the ratio of British to
American population is 35 per cent at the
older ages (sixty-five and over) but only 20 per
cent at the youngest (under fifteen). Correspondingly, the number of annual deaths in
Great Britain is about 35 per cent of the number
in the USA and the ratio of births is about
20 per cent. The recent rise in the level of births
in this country has, however, brought about
an increase in this ratio, and in 1963 Britain had
over 23 per cent of the US births. Even so, the
younger age-distribution of the American population explains its relatively rapid increase.

The chief constituents of population growth
in the two countries during the nine years 1955—
63 inclusive may be set out roughly as follows:

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

It would appear that both total natural
growth and net immigration are relatively low
in Britain—only 10 per cent of the American
figures for a population 30 per cent as large.
The complicating factors for Britain are, of
course, emigration and an older age-distribution.

American national statistics do not permit a

study of fertility by duration of marriage, but
it is possible to give an analysis of the female
population in 1960 classified by age and number
of children born alive. The data, which are as
follows for ages 20-49, exclude never-married
women, but include widows and divorced
women:

45-49 0:9 1:0 1-3 0-8 0-5 0-4 0-3 2:4

Although none of the age-groups shown had
a mean family size of as many as three children,
it is expected that the younger women whose
marriages are not terminated by death or
divorce will, when their families are completed,
be seen to have attained to this number on the
average.

On the basis of the results of the 1951 Census
in Britain, it is possible to construct a similar
statement, and corresponding figures for 1961,
though not yet available, should soon be
published. The British figures for 1951 are
approximately as follows; they relate to married
women alone:

(Numbers in 100,000)

As with the Americans, the younger British
women are expected, when their families are
completed, to surpass the average family sizes
shown for the older women in the foregoing
table. Moreover, during the period since 1951
the general level of fertility in Britain has risen
by nearly 20 per cent, thus giving rise to the
mean family size of 24 children mentioned
above. It is clear, nevertheless, that large

150

families are still much more popular in North
America than here, as the following data show:
