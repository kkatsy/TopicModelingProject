Relative Ages of Husbands and
Wives at Marriage

SOME FACTS

WHEREVER MARRIAGES ARE REGISTERED, the ages of the bride and groom are
recorded, and data are compiled in a square table showing the annual numbers of marriages
classified according to the celebrants’ ages in combination. This form of statistics is very
widely available. For instance, the Demographic Yearbooks of the United Nations Organization have included separate information for no less than eighty countries. The data for
England and Wales are published every year, and have been issued in this way for many
decades.

Although this is one of the best recorded of all demographic facts, it is also one of the

‘least well studied. What, indeed, can one extract from such material? The first thing to

do, clearly, is to examine its general nature. Some specimen figures are given below. They
relate to twenty-seven major countries taken in combination.

The totals of the rows and of the columns represent all the marriages classified by the
ages of the wife and husband respectively. From these, it is easy to calculate the number
of marriages to be expected in each cell of the table if the partners’ ages were uncorrelated,
that is, if there were no selection of partners by age, and mating was at random. For instance,
the numbers of men and women marrying where the ages of the bride and groom were both
twenty to twenty-four would be some 606,000 on this basis. The actual number was,
however, nearly 774,000, or about 30 per cent higher. Similar calculations for individual
countries, and for one country at different times, reveal an excess of much the same amount
at this point in the table. At certain other points, the actual number of marriages is less
than might be expected on the basis of random mating; for instance, the number of men
aged thirty to thirty-four marrying women aged fifty and over is less than one-tenth of
the “expectation”.

These facts illustrate the well-known fact of preference for some partners over others,
or “assortative mating”, in regard to age. What other factors enter into the make-up of

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

the square table? One is clearly the numbers of men and women available for marriage at
the time; another is the marriage rate and a third is the propensity to marry at a given age.
The combined effect of all these factors no doubt alters from time to time, and from place
to place, for a comparison of the square tables for different times and places reveals considerable variations. It would be of interest if such variations could be analysed into their
components. Certainly the first item—the numbers of unmarried men and women available
for marriage at each age, are often available from national statistics. It 1s, however, very
difficult to separate out the propensity to marry on the one hand and the age preferences
on the other.

If it were possible to eliminate purely demographic and economic factors, such as the
supply of and demand for marriage partners, the residue of variation would no doubt
represent the result of social and biological factors; for instance, the social pressures affecting the choice of mate could well have been quite different in England and Wales in 1851
from those in the same country in 1951, and the biological urges towards mates of varying
ages might conceivably have a different pattern between Japan on the one hand, and
France on the other, because of differences of race.

In an attempt to make such an analysis between these two broad groups of factors,
with the aid of an electronic computer, an extensive study was made of the variations, in
time and place, in the extent of age preferences. In this work, neither sex was assumed to
be “dominant” in determining a marriage; both were taken as having an equal influence
so far as age of partner was involved.

The conclusion reached from this study was that probably a very large part of the
variations is explained by the economic and demographic factors; in consequence, the
residue attributable to social and biological elements appears to have been relatively small.
Moreover, the form of the residue did not appear to present any consistent pattern; its
trend in time and place did not appear to lend itself to any rational interpretation in terms
of known social trends or racial differences.

The lack of recognizable pattern in the residue probably indicates that the attempt to
analyse the effects of demographic and economic factors on the one side and biosocial
factors on the other has not succeeded. In this attempt, the totals of the rows and columns
in the square table were assumed to be influenced by only the first of these classes of factor,
and the preferential element in the individual cells by only the second class. This dichotomy
could well be an over-simplification. While, therefore, the study indicated clearly that the
figures in any square table are largely the product of demographic and economic factors,
it seems safest to draw no conclusions at all regarding the possible effect of biosocial
factors on the data.
