HERE is probably no sphere in which
our traditional outlook of laisser-fatre

p the sphere of population movements.
espite the efforts of Francis Place to
mplement for the working man the gospel
§ prudence inculcated by the doctrines of
Malthus, the national conscience remained
impressed, even oblivious, to what might

the further question of what should be

burden that may come upon us. Teachers in
our schools may have to make the hardest
adjustments of all.

Difficulties of Forecasting

Examination of what we may expect, must
be based on the official returns of the Registrar-General, both annual reports and the
decennial census. From these we can draw
out the three curves that determine the size
of our population at any given time—the
marriage rate, the death or mortality rate,
and the rate of fertility. The last, it must be
added, is not the crude rate of births per
thousand of the whole population, but a
rate refined so as to give a measure of the
births per thousand of a selected group of
women whose birthdays fall within the
upper and lower limits of child-bearing age.
So far, we are on firm and reliable ground.
Unfortunately however this certainty does
not extend beyond recorded, historical
periods. We can only trace these rates and
their movement through given periods of the
past. If we are to make estimates of the
future, we have to go upon assumptions,
more or less reasonable, and from past
experience more or less likely to be fulfilled,
about the direction in which these curves
are to be expected to turn through various
periods of the future. Here all is conjecture,
and so little conclusive knowledge do we
possess about the relative strength of various
influences exerted from all the manifold
angles of our social life upon these rates,
that it is difficult even to estimate how
reasonable our estimates should be considered. Should we, for example, hold it
reasonable to include the effects of a world
war, supposing those effects could be
assessed, among probable influences on our
three rates in the future? Emigration or
immigration again may affect total numbers
in a quite unforeseen manner.
34 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

In order to proceed from the known to the
unknown, then, it will be necessary in the
following to make hypotheses. But when
they are announced, readers will be in a
position to judge for themselves the value of
the forecasts made.

A Declining Birth-Rate

Between the years 1871 and 1875, then,
the crude birth-rate in England and Wales
was 35:5 per thousand of the population. In
1933 it was 14:4. In other words, the rate
at which children are being born has fallen
by 60 per cent. during these 60 years—a fact
whose significance can be hardly short of
catastrophic. Before the War the rate was
already as low as 24-1 per thousand, and
by 1919 it had fallen to 18-5. With the
removal of the extraordinary conditions of
war time, the rate recovered and reached
a new peak of 25:5 in 1920. After that
year, it fell steadily until 1934 when it
was four points higher than in the previous
year—14:8. Since then this measure of
recovery has been retained and for the
moment the rapid decline in the _ birthrate seems to have been stayed. In many
quarters this has been greeted as evidence
that the curve of births has taken an upward
turn and may now be expected to rise. Such
optimism, however, is surely premature,
especially while the rate continues to fluctuate and shows no signs of a steady increase.
The rate for the first quarter of 1937 was
lower than for the corresponding quarter in
1936, although the position was reversed
again in the second quarter and the rate for
the whole year did in fact rise by one-tenth
of 1 per cent. Discussing this problem on
September 25th, 1937, that well-known
financial journal, the Economist, added a
necessary warning: “there is always a
tendency for the number of births in any
year to follow the number of marriages in
the previous year, and marriages have been
increasing ever since the bottom of the
slump, [although] this latter tendency may
now have been arrested since the number of
marriages in the second quarter of 1937 was
less than four-fifths of the total for the same
period last year.”” It concluded, “ there is

nothing in the vital statistics of the last fey
years to invalidate the general outline of t
future changes in population which is no¥
becoming generally familiar ’’—an outhi
which suggests the beginning of decline d
actual total numbers somewhere betwees

1940 and 1945.

Future Population in the School Ages

With the maintenance of the fertility and
mortality rates of 1933, the male populatiog
would increase until 1945 and the fema i
until 1943. Subsequently, both would com |
tract, and the contraction would be increa
ingly rapid as the years elapsed. But if the
future is to witness the beginning of decling 4
in total numbers, the curve of boys and girl
in the secondary school ages, 11-18, maf
already have passed its peak and assumed 4
descending course. In fact, both sexes 1
this age group were fewer in the census q
1931 than they were ten years earlier, ant
if numbers in recent years have recovere
somewhat, this inflation has been artificiall
created by the high birth-rate in the year
following the War. The actual downward
movement may be expected to reassert itse
during the present year and to gather force ¢
time passes. On the assumption that the rate
of fertility and mortality recorded in 193
persist unchanged (see Table Ia), boys c
secondary school age would be reduced fron
2,728,000 in 1938 to 1,958,000 in 1965, and
girls from 2,677,000 to 1,910,000 over the samé
period. In other words, the next twenty-seven
years would witness a decline of 28 -2 percent
in these boys and of 28-7 per cent. in the girls.
This age group would gradually lose ground
and become a dwindling proportion of the
total population, itself in steady decline.
Among the boys this group would figure a
13°9 per cent. of the total male population
in 1938, I1-9 per cent. in 1945 and 10:5 per
cent. in 1965, and whereas girls between I
and 18 contribute some 12:6 per cent. to the
total female community in 1938, this per4
centage would fall to 10-8 per cent. in 194
and to 9-6 per cent. in 1965. The curve of
boys aged 13-18, that is, those falling within
the public school ages, would follow a simila
course, reach a maximum of 2,102,000 in 1938
A DECLINING BIRTH-RATE AN

—1I33,000 more than in 1935—then after
seven years register a decline in numbers
by 15 per cent., after seventeen years by
26 per cent., and after twenty-seven years,
that is by 1965, by 30 per cent. (Boys in
the preparatory school ages, 8-12, are
already fewer and anticipations of the future
warn us to expect their numbers to fall even
more rapidly. The 1,754,153 enumerated
in the census of 1931 may be reduced by
1945 to 1,353,000 and by 1965 to 1,172,000.)

The situation would be even worse, on the
other hand, if instead of remaining constant
at its value in 1933 the birth-rate continued
to fall (see Table IB). By the year 1965, both
boys and girls from 11 to 18, and boys in the
public school ages, 13-18, might then have
been reduced to less than half their numbers
to-day, while the group of boys between 8 and
12 might fall to almost one-third of its size in
1921. Even if the birth-rate were to maintain
itsrecent slight recovery, moreover, and stabilize itself rather above its value in 1933, the
tesulting births would still be far below what
is necessary to maintain the school population undiminished, and any decline in
numbers would only be postponed, not
eliminated.

D THE COST OF EDUCATION 35

Enrolments in Secondary Schools

Clearly, then, enrolments in schools for
younger children must grow progressively
smaller. But how will numbers in the
secondary schools be affected as the totals
of all adolescents are gradually decimated ?
Will these latter reductions be directly
reflected in secondary school enrolments ?
Many anticipate that the effect of the falling
birth-rate in these schools will be more than
neutralized by the operation of other factors,
particularly by the growing public appreciation of the value of a secondary education
and by the determination of an _ everincreasing number of parents to secure its
benefits for their children—a determination
which frequently involves limiting the size
of families very strictly, and consequently
aggravating the population problem as a
whole. Undoubtedly this argument should
bear some weight. The proportion of children
going to a secondary school is already higher
than it was even ten years ago, and it is very
likely to increase still further. Any such
change, however, is most unlikely to be
drastic enough to offset the falling numbers
which must be expected in the reservoir

therefore, the decline in numbers could only
be postponed at best, and not eliminated.

Council and Self-Governing Secondary Schools

Since it is thus evident that the total of
pupils in all secondary schools will grow
progressively smaller, the question arises
whether the major losses must be borne by
the council secondary schools (i.e. the schools
financed and controlled by local education

authorities under county, or county boroug

councils) or by the independent secondary
schools (i.e. those which are entirely self
governing, although some may receive grants
from public funds). In other words, cag
these independent secondary schools hops
to claim a larger and larger share of a steadily
dwindling aggregate of possible pupils, and
so to escape at first, and finally to minimize,
actual losses in their numbers ? Some argué

that as families grow smaller, more and more

* Derived from a table in an article ‘‘ Opportunity and the Older Universities,” by D. V. Glass, which appears
in Political Arithmetic (Allen & Unwin). The council secondary schools are taken to include those where a local

the usual type.
A DECLINING BIRTH-RATE AND THE COST OF EDUCATION 37

parents will be able to afford and will in fact
plan non-state education for their children.
In estimating what weight should be given
to such arguments, the record of the last
two decades, during which families have been
growing progressively smaller and during
which, if these arguments are justified,
the independent schools should have been
attracting an increasing proportion of
secondary school attendants, must be held as
amportant evidence. And what do these
secords reveal? They reveal that while the
secondary school population as a whole has
grown rapidly, the great bulk of gains have
‘been made, not by the independent, but by
‘the council secondary schools. Before the
War, 36-8 per cent. of all boys in secondary
schools (including here all public schools and,
in addition, all other establishments which
appear on the Board of Education’s List of
ficient Secondary Schools) attended these
uncil schools, but twenty years later this
proportion had swollen to 51-6 per cent.,
fthe public school share having meanwhile
thrunk from over one-third to less than a
Muarter. The decrease in public boarding
Kchools from 19-3 per cent. to 10-9 per cent.
was even greater than that in public day
whools, the latter being from 14-8 per cent.
0 11'6 per cent. The other self-governing
chools also suffered some loss although
much lighter than the public schools. In 1913
ane former contributed 29-2 per cent. to the
fotal, at the later date 25-9 per cent. Boys
mm public boarding schools were actually
ewer in absolute numbers in 1933-4 than
M I919-20, and public day schools had
mcreased by no more than 4,071*—a striking
fontrast to the council secondary schools
yhere an addition of 70,101 boys nearly
Boubled this population (see Table II). And
me same is true for girls. In the early 1920's

*It is also ominous that the number of candidates
x the common entrance examination for public
poools was smaller in November 1937 than in any
mination for the past eighteen years. Total entries
Rthis examination during the year 1936-7 were 4,143
apared with 4,487 three years earlier, the latter and
Feome extent more recent figures being artificially
mated by the high birth-rate immediately after the

secondary schools attended those controlled
by councils, but by 1935-36 this figure had
swollen to almost 60 per cent., whereas the
independent schools’ pre-War share of well
over a half of the total is rapidly shrinking
to a third. These recognized independent
schools for girls have added no more than a
mere 800 to their numbers in sixteen post-War
years, while the girls’ population in council
schools, like the boys’, has nearly doubled
itself by an increase of some 72,450 during this
period (see Table III). The whole gain has unquestionably been made by the state council
schools. The experience of twenty years in
fact lends no support whatever to the theory
that smaller families will come to the rescue
of the self-governing schools and allow them
once more to take a larger proportion of all
secondary school pupils. (The non-recognized
private schools have been excluded from
these considerations, but there is no doubt
whatever that if the facts were known, they
have suffered incomparably greater losses
even than recognized schools. Their inclusion would only add greater weight to the
argument.)

Non-grant Independent Schools for Girls

But if the girls’ independent schools on
the efficient list have, as a body, barely
avoided actual losses in their numbers, what
have been the fortunes of the different
establishments which compose this group?
Such an analysis shows that whereas on the
one hand numbers have fallen in the schools
assisted by grants from public funds while
still retaining complete independence in
government, on the other hand, the population in the non-grant schools has risen from
8,718 in 1913-14 to 14,464 after the War and to
34,578 by 1935-36 (see Table IV). How does
it come about that these non-grant schools can
claim a post-War increase of some 20,000,
which, although small compared with the
council schools’ 72,500, must be counted as
substantial? Without any question, the reason
must be sought in the steady influx from the
vast numbers of non-recognized schools for
girls. As the standard required of a girl’s
education has gradually been raised, parents
have become less willing to entrust that
38

education to the poor type of small private
school; schools inspected by the Board of
Education and found efficient seem increasingly attractive. Consequently, not only
have well-established schools grown larger
and others of this type been opened, but in
addition many private schools have qualified
for recognition in order to ensure their own
survival. This latter tendency is particularly
reflected in the increase from 15 before the
War to 92 in 1935-36 of the recognized nongrant schools solely the responsibility of
proprietors. (The total of non-grant schools
on the efficient list increased from 62 in
1913-14 to 244 twenty-two years later.) A
growing appreciation of schools of the first
rank has resulted in schools controlled by
foundations accounting for 44-5 per cent. of

boarding school extras during the school year
1936-37 added to the fees 28-2 per cent. in
the autumn term, 16-8 per cent. in the
spring, and 15-5 per cent. in the summer,
averaging 18-8 per cent. for the whole year.
These figures can probably be accepted as
typifying boys’ public schools charging
boarders’ fees from £160 to £230, and also
the more expensive foundation schools for
girls. Here the charges for extras will
vary between £30 and {40 or so. Among
preparatory schools extras still represent a
far from negligible item, although according
to their prospectuses they usually make
school fees rather more inclusive than do the
public schools. When cost of clothes (an
item which is not infrequently more important for a girl than for her brother), pocket
money, and travel expenses are added, it is
clear that hardly less than £175 is required
to keep a girl at the majority of boarding
schools, and even where fees are at their
lowest, e.g. in the schools governed by
religious bodies, this cost can scarcely be
reduced below £130. For a boy, £200 Is
required on the average to keep him at a
boarding school from 13 to 18, and perhaps
as much at a preparatory school from 8 to 13.

Day scholars at the independent schools
rarely pay less than {20 for tuition; more
often the annual fee exceeds {30 and even
reaches £70 for girls and {95 tos. for boys.
Extras are naturally fewer than in boarding
schools, but are still far from disappearing
entirely. In the council secondary schools,
on the other hand, fees average {II I2s. a
year, and the announcement made by a
county school in Liverpool is broadly true,
that “ the only extras are a set of geometry
instruments (2s.), a school hymnal (1s. 6d.),
and a Bible (Is.),”’ although in some instances

text books and school subscriptions may add
another {3 or £4 to the annual bill. Furthermore, cost of clothes here represents far and
away a smaller sum than in boarding schools
and is noticeably smaller than in non-state
day schools.

Cost of Education and the Buirth-Rate

The pronounced difference between the
costs in state and independent schools has
two important issues. In the first place, some
parents determined to secure for their
children the privilege of attending one of the
independent schools can only do so by
limiting very strictly the size of family.
There are those bred in the boarding school
tradition who cannot think in terms unrelated to it. To many of these, no doubt,
the cost is trifling in relation to their total
income and would not be in the least likely
to hinder the birth of four or five children.
When a child is born, a reservation may
automatically be made at the school with
which the family name is associated. But
what of whose who while similarly minded
are not blessed with a similar income ? There
are also an increasing number of parents not
themselves so exclusively educated, but who
have come to consider a public school
essential for a boy and a good boarding
school desirable, if less indispensable, for
a girl. A professional man who can anticipate
no more than {800 or {1,000 a year when his
children will be ready for school cannot
afford to educate five or six in this way, and
if he is determined on it, he makes certain
that his family does not reach such proportions. In fact, where {400 a year is the
maximum expenditure that can be budgeted
for education, parents unable to guarantee
a boarding school for their children without
deciding to limit their family to two only
must compose a formidable group. Many of
these are no doubt the holders of the educational policies now offered by most insurance
companies, whereby an annual premium of
about {25 paid from birth of the child
secures four annual payments each of {100
from age 14 to 18. The very existence of such
policies is itself evidence of parents anxious
to buy an education more expensive than

     
 
  
   
  
  
 
   
   
 
 
  
 
   
   
   
 
   
    
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
  

they can easily afford from their curren
incomes. In addition, there are others wh
cannot aim at a boarding school, but wh
are nevertheless anxious to give their childr
something rather better than their neigh
bours. They would tend to feel that attend
ance even as a day pupil at an independen
school would give a convincing brand q
distinction. The additional cost involved 1
such a choice may be small compared wit]
that which a boarding school would demand
but many who choose this course have onlj
moderate incomes and they too must limi
the size of family in order to realize thes
ideals in their children’s education. Thd
conclusion is inescapable that although ther
may be other and more powerful forces
work, the cost of education must take som
share of responsibility for the falling birth
rate and for the shrinking of population soo§
to follow it.

Costs and Numbers in Self-Governing School

In the second place, not only have thesé¢
differentiated costs aggravated the popula
tion problem as a whole where parents
insistence on the more expensive education
must lead to a restriction of their families,
but they have also caused the independent
schools to fail in attracting more than
negligible share of the new recruits thronging
to secondary schools. For the former,
urgent questions must therefore arise. It is
evident that they must be prepared to
expect no increases in their numbers and
even to suffer actual losses in due course
unless they can discover some way of modifying current tendencies. The main element
of such modification, moreover, would have
to be either a substantial reduction in charges
or else the introduction of some new attrac-:
tions for the candidates they desire. Something along these lines, needless to say,
already exists in the scholarships and
remissions of fees offered by many of these’
schools. With present scarcity of information, however, it is impossible to tell how far
such schemes are taken, what type of family:
is anxious to avail itself of these facilities, or’
how often they are successful in attracting}
suitable pupils. It is also important to know

desired ; finally, the emancipation of women;
all these, it is suspected, are important
causal factors. But there is all too inadequate evidence for assessing what measure
of blame should be traced to each. Furthermore, certain limitations must be acknowledged.at the outset of any enquiry into
these causes. This is not a subject on which
precise information can be given. The-clues
must in the main reside in the minds of
parents, themselves no doubt often unable
to decipher their own motives. Unconscious
acceptance of the attitudes and customs of
those around us is bound to influence
behaviour too far to allow all motivation to
emerge into conscious thought. Nevertheless, patient and detailed enquiry can
perhaps go some way towards sorting the
tangled threads of conflicting influences. A
particular aspect of this task concerns itself
with education and with the question to what
extent its cost may be supposed to influence
the size of the family in all classes of the community. Such information is essential for
those concerned with policy-making in our
schools where present population treiitls will
first make themselves felt. It is also indispensable if this country is to attempt to
encourage parenthood. | |
