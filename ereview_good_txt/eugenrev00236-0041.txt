FERTILITY, INCOME

N the following table, extracted from the
| eonty issued Family Volume of the

Australian 1933 Census, the fertility of
families, as measured by the number of
dependent children living with them, is
tabulated by income and by the age of the
husband. The extraction of husband’s age
as a separate variable makes possible a fair
comparison of fertility and income. Subsequent investigation has shown that declarations of income in the Census were probably
understated all round to the extent of about
20 per cent. For the table and the appended
commentary we are indebted to Mr. Colin
Clark, Director of the Bureau of Industry,
Brisbane.

and PATERNAL AGE

The maximum figures for each age of
father are underlined. With young fathers
the greatest number of children appears to
be associated with low income, but from the
age of 30 upwards is definitely concentrated
in the £104 to £155 range. This in reality
probably corresponded to an income range
of {130 to £190, and would include the bulk
of the unskilled and semi-skilled wage
earners, at that date (1933). The “ basic
wage’ (unskilled wage) at that date was
about 60s. per week in most states, but the
average wage earner then lost a good many
weeks each year through unemployment. It
would exclude the chronically unemployed
and the more impoverished type of farmer.
