KENNETH HUTTON and CEDRIC CARTER“

Differential Fertility
A Follow-up Study on Old Wykehamists

Introduction

There have been encouraging indications in recent years that there is in Britain and the
United States a positive correlation between intelligence and planned family size (Carter
1966! and see Some Facts on p. 70 of this issue).

In 1953 Hutton3 showed that pupils of Winchester College, and especially the “‘scholars”’
selected at age thirteen by competitive academic examination, were a highly intelligent
section of the community; he gave the results of a questionnaire asking over 500 Old
Wykehamists how many children they had. The result was only slight evidence of a differential birth rate with respect to intelligence: for Old Wykehamists born in 1903-07 (entered
the school 1916-20) there was 85 per cent replacement, whereas for the population as a whole
there was about 90 per cent.

* “Family size’? = live births per married couple.
+ Excluding 2 recent deaths, after the family was complete.

The previous report noted that among the scholars at Winchester College, who covered
a twenty-year range (born 1893-1912; entered the school 1906-25), “‘there is evidence of a
steady increase in family size so that it may be expected that the 1921-25 group (i.e. those
born in 1908-12) will have not merely more children than the average of the population,
but even just enough for replacement. Perhaps in ten years’ time someone may repeat this
inquiry with a later group of both commoners and scholars and see if this optimism is
justified.”

It has taken fourteen years for the inquiry to be repeated, and it has been confined to
the most gifted group, the scholars; but the predictions that their fertility would rise to
replacement rate and above have proved accurate.

DIFFERENTIAL FERTILITY

Method |
As in the first inquiry, letters were sent to the last known address of scholars. The
period covered was entry to the school between 1926 and 1940, and in addition the 1921-25
entry (the last five years of the previous inquiry) were re-circulated to see how manychildren
they had had since the previous inquiry.

Results

The findings of the 1953 inquiry and of the present (1966) inquiry are summarized in
Table 1.
A number of comments can be made on the results.

1. The increased average family size in Britain has included Winchester scholars.
The 1961 Census shows for women married once only, enumerated with their husbands,
the following family size by husband’s occupation after 15-19 years marriage duration:
Professional—self-employed 2-2; Employers and managers, large units 1-8; Skilled workers
2-2 and Unskilled workers 2:3.

2. The 1921-25 group has fulfilled its hopes, having produced the extra fourteen children hoped for by those replying in 1953. In addition, two of the five who were not traced in
the first survey, were traced in the second and had had eight children between them.

* Assuming, as before, that 90% of those born will survive to age 30, though for the more recent groups
the survival is likely to be over 95%.

3. The proportion of replies received in the second inquiry (221 out of 238=93 per
cent), although smaller than the astonishing figure for the first inquiry (200 out of 208=96
per cent), leaves little margin for doubt about the significance of the results.

4. The final age-group in each inquiry shows a “‘tailing-ofl” in family size. This is
because not all men aged thirty-nine to forty-three would be expected to have completed
their families—indeed some say that they have not, and three wives in the 1936-40 age group
are currently pregnant. The family size of the 1936-40 group may be expected to increase
beyond an average of three children.

An estimate of generation-replacement rate for the scholars is shown in Table 2.
No such estimates are available for men in England and Wales. The generation-replacement
rates for women given (1956 Commentary) by the Registrar General for those born in the
eight corresponding quinquennia are 76, 71, 68, 70, 70, 80, 85, 91 per cent. Assuming that
the excess of male over female replacement rates declines from about 20 per cent for births

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

in 1893-07, to 10 per cent for 1908-12, and to 5 per cent for 1923-274 the figures shown in
the last column of Table 2 are obtained. Commenting on Table 2:

1. The most significant column is the penultimate one showing that the percentage
replacement has steadily risen over the past thirty years, and is now more than high enough
for complete replacement.

2. This point is sufficiently obvious from Table 1, without making any allowances for
mortality, still less for children yet unborn, or even for people who did not reply to the
circular. The 140 scholars who entered the school in 1931-40 (born 1918-27), including
the twenty early deaths (mostly war casualties) and the nine not traced, are known to have
295 surviving children already, and some at least of the nine who were not traced or did not
reply may be expected to have children.

3. No detailed attempt has been made to subdivide the scholars by subsequent
profession. It is, perhaps, of interest that the score or so of natural scientists in the 1926—40
group (scholars were encouraged to stay on the classical side) include eight Fellows of the
Royal Society (one is also a Nobel prize-winner) and two others who hold University
chairs. These ten already have thirty-seven children and an average family size (since one is
not married) of 4-1.

4. The high fertility in this gifted group may well represent the upper end of a positive
relationship of intelligence and family size. Alternatively, but perhaps less likely, the high
fertility may be a more specific feature of this group, which is not necessarily representative
of all groups in the country with similarly high intelligence.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This inquiry would not have been possible without the co-operativeness of over 200 “Old College
Men” whom we wish to thank publicly. We are greatly indebted to Mr. Peter Cox for the estimate
of male generation-replacement rates for England and Wales. We are also grateful to the Eugenics
Society for a small grant to cover expenses.
