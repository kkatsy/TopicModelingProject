THE

EUGENICS REVIEW

THE SEX RATIO AT DEATH.

IN a previous paper I stated that the balance of the sexes in the population is affected by two physiological causes, viz., the sex ratio at birth
and the sex ratio at death. The former has given rise to endless speculation and controversy and has been made the subject of countless
disquisitions, while the latter has, on the comparative side at any rate,
been curiously neglected.

The progress of a generation through life has not inaptly been compared to the march of an army which throughout is subjected to a deadly
fire from the enemy. It has been further noted that the incidence of this
fire is not spread equally over the whole course of life, that it is much
More concentrated and deadly at certain ages than at others. If we
divide our army of the population by sexes it will be found that there is a
differentiation in the intensity of the fire directed on the two armies, and
that in the European countries, over a given period, a male army of equal
numbers will suffer heavier losses than one composed entirely of females.
Moreover, the severity of the respective losses would be found to occur
at different periods, and if instead of one army we imagine a group of
ammies, each one representing a separate country, it will be found that
the ratio of loss between males and females differs according to the
country which they represent. To illustrate and amplify this picture I
have prepared a few tables relating to nine European countries in which
the armies of males and females have been reduced to equal numbers, in
order to show the respective ratio of loss between sexes in these different
countries. The period selected has been years 1910-1g911-1912. The losses
are calculated on the total deaths in the respective populations during
those years; and the populations at ages and sexes have been calculated
on the basis afforded by the Census of 1910-11.

In Table I. is given the ratio of male deaths to a 100 female deaths
at all ages during the years in question. It will be seen from this table
that among an equal number of males and females in the population of
England and Wales 113 males died for every 100 females, and that in
every other country dealt with in the table there was a considerable
excess except in the case of Ireland, where the male deaths show a
114 EUGENICS REVIEW.

slightly lower ratio than do those of females. What the meaning of this
ratio in England and Wales is in regard to the balance of the sexes and
the population, may perhaps be made clear by the statement that had the
deaths among males been at the same ratio as it was among females,
45,000 males who died during those years would have survived. In other
words, the excess of male over female deaths among equal numbers of
the population represents a loss of 15,000 male lives annually.

_ For the purpose of comparing the respective losses at various ages
I have divided the population into four age groups, viz., zzfancy, covering the period from birth to the age of five years; childhood, from five
to 15; adult life, covering the period from 15-65; and age, covering the
period of those who survive beyond the age of 65.

Table II. shows the relative incidence of sex mortality in two divisions, under the age of one and between one and five. It will be noted
that in the first age group there is little variation except in the case of
Italy, in which the excess is only 50 per cent. of that in the countries
coming next above it in the table. In the age group 1-5 there is a striking
fall in the excess of male deaths, which in Ireland and in Italy are on a
lower ratio than those of females.

In Table III. is given the ratio for the period of childhood, extending
from the ages of 5-15; and from this it will be seen that only in the
Netherlands, among the nine countries, is there an excess of male deaths
at this period of life; while in France, Italy, and more particularly in
Ireland, there is a very considerable excess of female mortality during
this period.

For the period covering what is generally regarded as the working
period of life, that is from 15-65 years of age, I have divided the population into ten-year age groups; and the results are given in Table IV.

This table presents some very curious features. In England and
Wales and in France there is throughout a steady increase in the relative
mortality at each age group, but this is not the case with any other of
the seven countries. The increase in the case of England and Wales is
from 113 at ages 15-25 to 131 at ages 55-65. The rise in the relative
mortality is very much more marked in the case of France, being only
108 at the earliest age group and having risen to 156 in the latest. In
the case of Norway, while at ages 15-25 and 25-35 there is a very heavy
excess of male mortality, this excess has almost disappeared in the next
age group, viz., 35-45, and is considerably lower in the two last age
groups than it is in the two first. In the case of Sweden we find a considerable fall in the second age group as compared with the first, and a
further fall in the third age group, followed by a sudden and considerable
116 EUGENICS REVIEW.

rise in the fourth and a further very slight rise in the last. In the case
of the Netherlands there is also a very marked drop in the second age
group as compared with the first, followed by a very slight rise in the
third. In both of these latter age groups there is a considerable excess
of female mortality. In the age group 45-55 there is again a sudden and
marked rise followed by a slight increase in the last group. In Denmark
the second group shows a heavy fall from the first, followed by a still
heavier rise in the third and fourth and a less marked rise in the last
group. In Scotland there is little difference between the first and second
age groups, while the rise in the third is comparatively slight. This,
however, is succeeded by a violent bound upward in the fourth group,
followed by a very slight fall in the fifth. In Italy the first and second
age groups show no change in the relative mortality of the sexes, and
throughout this 20 years it is considerably lower in the case of males than
of females. There is a marked rise in the third age group, a less considerable one in the fourth and a noticeable decline in the last. In
Ireland there is a small rise in the second age group, in the third the
natio is stationary, and in the fourth there is a relatively marked increase,
followed by a decline in the last group. It will be seen that the variations in the ratio of the different ages are somewhat remarkable. In the
case of England the variation amounts to 18, in the case of France to 48,
Norway 22, Sweden 20, Netherlands 27, Denmark 38, Scotland 25, Italy
25, and Ireland only to.

The picture of relative mortality is completed by giving male and
female deaths in two groups, viz., ages 65-75 and over 75. Italy presents
a marked contrast to all the other countries, as it shows an excess of
female mortality in old age. In Sweden the variation is extraordinarily
violent between the two age periods, but there is nothing to call for
special remark in regard to the other countries.

Looking at the tables as a whole, it will be seen that in the case of
England and Wales there is only one age period, viz., that of childhood,
in which the relative male mortality is lower than the female; and that
even here the difference is very slight. The same remark holds good
with regard to France, Norway and Sweden, though in the first two
THE SEX RATIO AT DEATH. 117

named countries the male advantage is considerably greater during the
period of childhood. Scotland has one period, that of childhood, in
which there is a female excess, while in the age group of 15-25 the
mortality of the two sexes is equal. In the Netherlands, while there is
am: excess of male mortality in childhood, there is a curiously marked
excess of female mortality at ages 25-45. Denmark, with an excess of
female mortality in childhood, has an almost identical excess at ages
25-35. In Ireland there is a male excess in five age groups, with a female
excess in the other five. From ages 1-45 an excess of female mortality
is shown, while under one and from 45 upwards male mortality is in
excess. In Italy at six of the age groups a female excess is shown, and
only in four is male mortality in excess of female. The feature by which
Italy distinguishes itself from Ireland is, as already noted, that in old
age there is a certain advantage, slight it is true, on the side of the males.
Perhaps a more accurate picture of the physiological incidence of sex
mortality would be obtained by excluding deaths from all forms of
wiolence, suicidal, homicidal and accidental, and confining our tables to
those causes which, for want of a better name, are generally described as
“natural.” I have done this for England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland
and Italy, and the results are shown in Table VI.

118 EUGENICS REVIEW.

In this table the relative mortality is given at all ages and in the
various age groups from childhood upwards. In the case of deaths under
five there is practically no difference in the ratio, whether deaths from
violence are excluded or not. It will be seen at once that the exclusion
of deaths from outside causes makes a very material difference in the
relative ratio of mortality, particularly in certain age groups. For all
ages the greatest reduction is shown in the case of Scotland, which falls
from 106 to 102. In England and Wales and in Italy the fall at all ages
is only two, while in Ireland it is one. In the case of England and Wales
the greatest reduction is shown in the age groups in the earlier stages of
adult life. At ages 15-25 the reduction is 14, while at 25-35 and 35-45 it
is 11. In Scotland the greatest reduction is shown at the same ages, but
it is between 25-35 that the maximum fall is recorded. In Italy the
maximum fall is from 25-45, while in Ireland the fall is almost equal
throughout the age period 15-55, and nowhere does it exceed five. In
this table there are two age groups, viz., 5-25, in which female mortality
is in excess of male in England and Wales. In Scotland the period
extends from 5-45, in Italy from 1-35 and from 65 upwards, and in
Ireland from 1-65.

Summing up the results shown by this last table, it would appear
that in England and Wales there is a heavy excess of male mortality in
the first year of life; that during the next four years females have a
somewhat better chance of life than males; that for the next ten years
there is a considerable advantage on the male side; that from 15-25 the
chances, apart from deaths by violence, are almost equal; and that
throughout the rest of life the males are at a more or less considerable
disadvantage. In Scotland the same remarks hold good for the first 15
years of life, while during the next 20 years there is a marked advantage
on the side of the males, and for the ten years 35-45 this advantage continues, though in a much diminished degree, while for the rest of life the
advantage is even more markedly on the side of the females. In Italy
the female advantage is much less during the first year of life, while up
to the age of 35 the advantage is entirely on the side of the males, is
passed to the females for the next 30 years, and is regained by the males
at the extreme end of life. In Ireland, after the great initial advantage
of female infants under one, the advantage remains with the males up
to the age of 65 and only passes to the females in old age.

It would be an interesting and not unprofitable study to endeavour
to ascertain what are the precise factors which go tc make up these
differences in the incidence of sex mortality, but at the present moment I
have neither the time nor the material to enter into this somewhat
complex question. All I can do for the moment is to submit these
elementary considerations and to leave it to more leisured and capable
hands to continue the investigation.
