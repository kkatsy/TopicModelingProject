HUMAN DIVERSITY

The Nature and Significance of
Differences among Men

KENNETH MATHER

What makes human beings different from one another? Why is it that each of us
is unique? Human diversity has been the subject of interest and speculation since
the beginning of man. It has been accepted as inevitable and bewailed as unjust;
made the basis of reverence and of persecution; attributed to divine creation and
to diabolical intervention. It has been traced to heredity and to the environment,
to ancestry and to upbringing, often with a gross distortion of the evidence and
a perverse interpretation of the conclusions. In this fascinating study Professor
Mather looks at the various causes of diversity—environmental, genetical and
social; sees how they act and interact; and examines the way natural selection is
related to and works on the differences they bring about.

“Professor Mather sets out the various factors making for diversity with
great persuasiveness and lucidity. This is a book for the general reader,
inasmuch as it eschews a technical vocabulary and uses only a little elementary
mathematics, but it is written with authority.”

PROBLEMS OF RADIATION GENETICS
N. P. DUBININ
Translated by G. H. BEALE

This book gives a concise account of the effects of different forms of radiation
on living organisms, and includes a very thorough report of Russian contributions
to the subject as well as those of Western workers. Among other topics the author
also considers the danger to man of increased amounts of radiation in the atmosphere from radio active fall-out, the hazards to pilots of spaceships from cosmic
radiation, and the more positive applications to plant and animal breeding.
