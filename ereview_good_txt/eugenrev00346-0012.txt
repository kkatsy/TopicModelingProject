The Fertility of the English Middle Classes.
A Statistical Study.

BY

J.W. BROWN, MAJOR GREENWOOD, M.R.C.P..
and the late FRANCES WOOD. O.B.E., B.Sc.

PREFATORY NOTE.

The research upon which this paper is founded was Ieft in an unfinished state
in the summer of 1915 when the collaborators had to relinquish their ordinary
tasks for war-work. At that time, about two-thirds of what we intended to publish were ready for press. Since death has dissolved our partnership, I had to
choose between abandoning the research, completing the inquiry and assuming
sole responsibility for its conclusions, or publishing in an abbreviated form so
much of it as had been approved by all three of us. I have decided to adopt the
third course. The only changes made in the original draft have been omissions
of passages which I think we should have re-considered and the abbreviation of
others which seemed to need better statistical justification or to have lost their
importance. In its present form, the paper is a very modest contribution to
knowledge, but I hope it may be of interest to those who have the opportunity to

make more extended investigations.
M.G.

The data of this study were collected by a committee of the Birth
Rate Inquiry Commission (National Council of Public Morals) Dr.
Agnes Savill being the member to whose exertions the success of the
undertaking was due.

Two schedules were issued by the committee (see appendix) the
object being to collect particulars respecting an adequate sample of
married women who had pursued a course of education of university
standard and similar information respecting a sample of women
—usually relatives of the preceding—who had not done so.

In this way, it was hoped to throw light upon the question of
middle class fertility in general and to determine the effects upon
fertility of education. Inall, 787 schedules were handed to us; 492
related to university women, 295 to others. Of the latter, 140 related
to unmarried women and were discarded. In all, 634 schedules
were used in some part or the whole of our _ investigation.
The colleges and Universities represented are shown in table I.
As will be seen in the appendix, information was sought on
the schedules with respect to a large number of topics, some
of which hardly lend themselves to statistical evaluation, while others

are only indirectly related to the subject of fertility. We shall
confine our attention to (1) Fertility in its relation to age, duration
of marriage and education. (2) The prevalence of artificial restriction and_ its effect upon fertility. (3) The question whether the
observed rate of fertility is adequate to maintain the numbers of the
middle classes by natural increase.

We shall in the first place describe the system of tabulation
adopted and the sources of error encountered.

As the dates of birth marriage and filling in the schedule were entered,
we could tabulate by the nearest age of the wife at marriage, (e.g., 26
years and 7 months entered as 27 years, etc.,) and the nearest duration
of marriage. Unfortunately an appreciable number of schedules did
not provide the date of marriage and a smaller number only gave the
year, not the month of birth. Our rule in such cases was to subtract
the calendar year of marriage from the date of filling in the schedule,
to obtain the duration, or the calendar year of birth from that of marriage to obtain the age at marriage, unless the latter was actually entered
This necessarily involves a possible error of as much as eleven months
and could not be avoided—so far as the age at marriage was concerned
—by assuming the figure placed in the square provided for age at
marriage to be the age at the previous birthday, since some of the
writers had interpreted the question to mean the nearest age, others—
the majority—to mean the age at the previous birthday (we could test
this, of course, on the schedules giving full particulars as to dates).
Comparatively few, however, failed to give the month of birth, so that
the errors as to age were small; but in the case of durations they were
more considerable, and might be relatively important for durations
of less than, say, nine or ten years. On this account marriages of
less than nine years’ duration were omitted form the tables subsequently defined as ‘‘select’’ if the nearest duration could not be ascertained. With respect to the age of husband, since the schedule did
not provide for the entry of his date of birth, we had to use the figure
entered as age at marriage. As we have remarked, this figure did not
in the case of the wife always represent the age at the previous birthday, but it generally did so. Probably therefore it would be fair to
160 EUGENICS REVIEW.

add six months to the mean age of husband as shown in our tables to
render it comparable with that of wife.

The process of tabulation was complicated by the existence of
ambiguities and inconsistencies in the returns, e.g., the age at marriage was sometimes not to be reconciled with the date of birth, or the
duration of marriage was inconsistent with the ages of children born.
To render the final results as accurate as possible, the whole of the
data were first classified and analysed by two of us, and then reclassified
by the third, who corrected any slips which had been made in tabulation and reworked the various coefficients.

It is worthy of note that although the schedules were filled in by
educated persons the number, of evidently incorrect particulars was
appreciable, a fact which proves that the method of inquiry by schedule
even when carried out under peculiarly favourable circumstances is
subject to an observational error, (distinct, of course, from the error of
sampling which we can measure approximately ,) of some magnitude.

In tabulating size of family we included still births and miscarriages during the last two months of pregnancy, but their number was
small, see table XXXVI. We did not include existing pregnancies,
even if of more than seven months’ duration. As we included miscarriages, the omission seems illogical, but the wording of the schedule
did not expressly provide for the recording of existing pregnancies, so
that the returns may have been incomplete and the recorded proportion
of pregnant women too small.

. The first part of our inquiry is to compare the fertilities
of. college and non-college women. Since this was intended to
measure the supposed effect of education upon fertility, it was
necessary to select those schedules which would admit of legitimate comparison from the proposed point of view. We therefore rejected (a) Schedules containing imperfect particulars as to marriages
of duration less than nine years, (vide supra,). (b). Schedules relating to
pupils in physical training colleges. (c) Schedules relating to pupils
whose stay in residential colleges was less than three years. (d) Schedules relating to students who had taken no examinations at all (academic
failure was not a ground of rejection, we included pupils who had sat
for but failed to pass their examinations).

178 EUGENICS REVIEW.

The residues form our ‘select’ experiences. We then prepared tables
to which the rejected data were admitted *and the resultant ‘aggregate’
experiences were analysed. Finally all data were assembled and the
consequent ‘general aggregate’ analysed. The results are summarised
in Tables XXIV. and the various detailed Tables IT. to XXIII. enable
the reader to repeat or modify our calculations. With respect to the
actual analysis, we may note that Sheppard’s corrections were not used
since some of the distributions did not fulfill the conditions which justify their employment. Further, the correlation co-efficients involving the age of the husband were not computed throughout for it became
evident that the inclusion of this variable would not sensibly increase
the accuracy of predictions from regression equations, a conclusion
reached by the analysts of the Scottish Census of Fertilityf. It will
be seen that the constants of ‘select’ and ‘aggregate’ tables differ from
one another so little that it is a matter of indifference which are
used for comparative purposes. Comparing the university and nonuniversity groups we find that the age at marriage of the former is
higher and their effective fertility lower as we should expect. The
question is whether [the difference in mean size of family can be entirely
explained by such divergences of mean age and duration of marriage:
To answer this question we must employ some form of regression equation and, before doing so, must enquire whether such an equation of the
first degree is sufficiently accurate for the purpose.

Mr. Rae’s analysis of the Scottish Census returns demonstrated,
on the basis of very large numbers, that the regressions of the different
variables one on another were not linear. That the same is generally
true in our case will appear from the figures in Table XXV._ In strictness, therefore, we ought to have calculated regression equations of
higher degree than the first. But, not to speak of the serious addition
to the work of computation, there are objections to using formulae
based on higher moments when the number of observations at our disposal is very limited. The point therefore arose whether a first degree
equation although theoretically inadequate might not be practically
sufficient. To throw light on this point, we decided to compare the
predictions yielded by Mr. Rae’s equations of the first and second degrees with the observed values in a small random sample. This would
tell us how far his predictions were actually improved by the use of a
regression equation of higher order than the first. The results of this
test are shown in tables XXVI. A. & B. Our test is, of course, incomplete, but we think the following inferences are warranted by it. (1). In
the case of marriages of moderate duration, there is little to choose
between the results predicted with the help of a first degree equation in
terms of age of wife at marriage and duration of marriage, or by aid of a
formula involving second order terms. (2). For marriages of completed
fertility, the results obtained by using a first degree equation in which
46 minus the age of wife at marriage (vide infra) is used for the dura
*Schedules without particulars of husbands’ ages were not rejected, for the
reasons stated in the text.

tSee Census of Scotland, Report, 1911, Vol. III., Fertility of Marriage,
p. XXXIX,
THE FERTILITY OF THE ENGLISH MIDDLE CLASSES. 179

tion of the fertile period are not seriously less accurate than those furnished by an equation of the second degree, but somewhat over estimate
the probable size of family.

We think, therefore, that comparisons of college and non-college
fertilities, where allowances for age and duration are made with the
help of simple equations, are legitimate. We also think that the predictions of completed fertilities, although less satisfactory, may be
sufficiently accurate for the purposes of our discussion and in the present essay we shall not use any equations of degree higher than the first .*

Returning to the comparison between college and non-college
women, the Regression Equations are given in Table XXVII., while
the results of correcting for age and duration of marriage are shown in
Table XXVIII. In Table X XIX. the method is applied to the data collected by Mrs. Sidgwick and some notes are added with respect to another
investigation. All these results lead to the same conclusion, viz.,
that, paying attention to the errors of sampling, there is no difference
between the average size of the family of a non-college mother and
that of a college mother which cannot be explained by differences of
age at marriage and duration of marriage. In other words, our analysis
confirms the opinion of Mrs. Sidgwick that there is no physiological difference between the fertilities of the two classes, that the alleged prejudicial
effects of higher education per se upon the capacity or inclination of
women to bear children do not exist.

The whole preceding argument has been based upon a grouping of
inatcrial subject to a theorctically important objection. The durations
of marriages were tabulated without paying any attention to the fact
that in a few instances such durations extended beyond the age at which
child bearing ceases. This method of tabulation must lower the correlation
between size of family and effective duration, assuming that durations
extending, say, beyond the age of 46 are physiologically ineffective
from the present point of view.

To determine the effect of this another set of correlation tables was
prepared, duration of marriage being now defined as the actual duration
or 46 years less the age at marriage when the marriage had extended
into the normally infertile period. Then the various constants were
recalculated and are compared with the previously stated results in
Tables XXX., XXXI., XXXIT., XXXII.

*For very short durations, e.g., one or two years, the regression equations
are quite untrustworthy, thus in the case of durations of no years at all they will
still give a positive value for the size of family, and again for very long durations, such as would be got by not limiting the duration in the manner described
above, they will lead to absurd results. It must be clearly understood that their
value is restricted within definite limits.

46 years minus Age at Marriage.)

The report above quoted refers to a similar enquiry amongst American
Women Students carried out in 1885,f and figures are given showing that in
196 Marriages of American Women Graduates with an average Duration of 6°7
years the mean family was 1.342. No mention is made of the Age at Marriage,
but if it is assumed that in the average they married at the same age as the 1887
English Students, viz., 26.7 years, the predicted family according to the Select
College Equation would be 1.892+ .068, using the Aggregate College (duration
as per schedule) equation 1.861-+ .067, and the Aggregate College (duration
limited to 46 years minus age at Marriage, 1.838+4- .066.

“TIXXX STV,
Tgo EUGENICS REVIEW.

It will be seen that the differences although in some instances significant from the sampling aspect, are absolutely small and that in this
material it hardly matters which tabulation is used. The reason is, of
course, that very few of the marriages were of long duration. In data
to which this limitation does not apply, it would be necessary to deal
with the matter more carefully. It is hardly sufficient to assign an
arbitrary terminus ad quem since the epoch of menopause is variable.

It having been suggested to us that the average families of women
who took high academic honours were smaller than those of their less
gifted or industrious class mates, we endeavoured to attend to the point.
Unfortunately the particulars of degrees were very incomplete; Table
XXXIV. contains such available information as might be thought
relevant. If women are classified by the average daily period of study
no significant differences in sizes of family emerge. The basis of this
classification is, however, so unsatisfactory that we personally attach
“no importance to it. Our general conclusion is that, in view of the
concordance between what our sample reveals and what Mrs. Sidgwick
found, the onus of proof is absolutely upon those who still assert that
the higher education of women, in the ordinary sense of that term, diminishes their physiological fertility. The extent to which effective fertility is reduced by postponement of marriage is shown in the tables .*

A question has been raised with respect to the influence of the
husband. We have already seen that both in our small sample and in
the larger experience of the Scottish Census Office, the age of husband
at marriage is not highly correlated with the size of family and that its
inclusion in the regression equation does not sensibly increase the accuracy of the prediction deduced therefrom. It might be, however, since
like mates with like, that husbands of collegiates differ from those
of non-collegiates. The only information of statistical value with
respect to the husbands which might help to elucidate this matter is the
specification of occupations.

Occupations are classified in Table XXXV. which contrasts the
occupational distributions of the husbands of collegiate and noncollegiate women. We also provide a tabulation of middle and upper
class occupations derived from the last four censuses, Table XXXVI.

Our data show that the proportion of husbands who were engaged
in teaching, professional or research duties is significantly larger in the
collegiate sample, while the converse is true with respect to commercial
occupations. The husbands of the college women also show some excess
of clergy and civil servants but not a significant excess.

In Table XXXVII. the mean sizes of family observed when the
marriages are grouped by husband’s occupation are compared with the
predictions of the general aggregate equation (10). Such differences
as emerge cannot b: considered significant having regard to the probable
errors involved.

We have also classified the women themselves by their own occupations after marriage. These Tables, (XX XVIII. and XXXIX), pro
*In view of post-war conditions and the impoverishment of the middle classes,
the delay of marriage due to necessary continuance in gainful occupations introduces a factor the magnitude of which may easily transcend such differences as
those noted in the text.—M,G.

THE FERTILITY OF THE ENGLISH MIDDLE CLASSES. 197

vide other information respecting limitation of fertility to which we
shall refer below. Here we note that the observed fertility of women
engaged in remunerative occupations is slightly less than that calculated but, bearing in mind the probable errors which in almost every
case exceed one third of the differences, we do not draw any conclusion.

It must also be remembered that even had we demonstrated a difference significant from the statistical standpoint it would not have followed that difference of occupation caused the difference of fertility.
It would have been a case of correlation but not necessarily of causation.

Before passing on to the topic of restriction we may briefly refer to
miscellaneous comparisons shown in Tables XL. to XLIV. Table XL.
shows that there are no significant differences between the miscarriage
and abortion rates of the two samples. Owimg to numerous failures to
state the ages of surviving children we could not tabulate infant mortality, the effective numbers of children at risk not being shown. In any
event these matters can be studied elsewhere on the basis of far larger
numbers and we need not discuss our tiny samples.

The tabulation by nursing capacities, (Table XLI.), brings out no
essential distinction.

The tabulation by state of health after 18 years of age, (XLII.),
indicates a significantly higher proportion of collegiate women returning themselves as in ‘‘excellent’’ health; but the groups from ‘‘fair’’
to ‘‘bad’’ do not differ appreciably. The aggregate of the ‘‘fair to
‘*bad’’differs by 6.18+2.78 in favour of the collegiates. Taking
‘*Excellent.’’ and ‘‘Good’’ together the difference is 7.98+2.84 in
favour of the college women.

Table XLIII. shows the sizes of family tabulated according to
health after 18. Both amongst collegiates and non-collegiates the groups
‘‘excellent’’ to ‘‘good’’ show a greater mean family than the ‘‘fair,’’
*‘poor’’ and ‘‘bad.’’ Taking ,,excellent’’ and ‘‘good’’ together,
the fertility of the college women was 2.08+ .06 of the non-collegiates
2.30+.11. In the combined groups ‘‘fair’’ and ‘‘bad,’’ the collegiates’ mean family was 1.51+.11 and that of the non-collegiates 1.6
+.20. The differences within each class are .52+.13 and .69-+ .28.
Taking collegiates and non-collegiates together, the mean family for
‘‘good’’ and ‘‘excellent’’ is 2.09+- .05 and of those in ‘‘fair’’ or ‘‘bad’’
health 1.56 .10, a difference of .584.11. This comparison is subject
to the objection that no allowance has been made for differences in duration of marriage and age at marriage but, as can be seen, when ‘‘excellent’’ and ‘‘ good’’ are grouped together and ‘‘fair’’ ‘‘ poor’’ and ‘‘bad’’
placed in another single class of differences the duration and age are too
small to need consideration. Naturally even this does not completely
meet the objection, since the means of the groups might be identical
yet the distributions different. This however, is not a point we can
discuss while we have so small asample, in as much as sub-tabulation
would be nugatory. Table XLIV. shows the sizes of the families of
which the collegians were members (a similar tabulation of the noncollegians is not provided because an unascertainable proportion of
these are sisters of collegians and could not be assigned to their proper
sibships). The mean size of the families of the parental generation is
5.62; the mean size of completed families (sterile marriages excluded.,)
shown by the Census of Scotland in 1911 was 6.2.

THE FERTILITY OF THE ENGLISH MIDDLE, CLASSES. 199

This figure cannot of course be compared with the predicted complete family of the collegians themselves and the table is chiefly of
interest with regard to the problem of limitation to which we next
turn. It may also be remarked that we have no knowledge of the
duration of the parents’ marriages.

Some particulars as to limitation have already been given, viz., in
Tables XXXVIII., XXXIX. and XLIV. Table XLV. records the
extent to which attempts at restriction were said to have been made.
Among collegians a minimum of 47 .4°% and perhaps as many as 62.18%
are ostensibly of limited fertility; the corresponding figures for noncollegians are 39.87% and 54.95%, the differences are 7.53 + 8.08
and 7.18 + 3.61, which are insignificant.

The tabulation of methods, Table XLVI, calls for no remarx here
since there is no standard of comparison, but we now call attention to
the small proportion of definitely assigned methods and the great frequency of vague attributions. We shall have more to say upon’ this
later on.

The reasons for limitation are tabulated in XLVII. and their proportional frequencies are almost identical in the two groups. It need
hardly be said that the classification is very uncertain because the
reasons alleged in the schedules might not be allotted by other analysts
to the same classes since they were sometimes ambiguous.

In Table XLVIII. the proportions of ‘‘ limited’’ and ‘‘not limited’’
marriages are classified by duration with the natural result that the
proportion of ‘‘limited’’ marriages increases with duration. Table
XLIX. compares average sizes of families and brings out the fact that,
even when sterile unions are excluded, the ‘‘limited’’ families are
neither uniformly nor on the average smaller than ‘‘unlimited’’ families. It also appears from Table L. that there is no important difference between the partial correlations of size of family and duration
(age at marriage constant), of ‘‘limited’’ and ‘‘unlimited’’ marriages.

Table XLIV. shows that the sibships of the women ‘‘limiting’’
their fertility are not smaller than those of the others, and Tables
XXXVITT. and XXXIX. exhibit the differences when sterile matings
are not excluded. These last mentioned results are of minor importance. The data of XLIV. are far too incomplete to be proper measures of the real fertility of parental stocks, Tables XX XVIII. and
XXXIX. only bring out what would in any event be expected, since
pathologically sterile persons would naturally not use artificial means«
of limitation so that the whole group of ‘‘unlimited’’ marriages has
its average fertility reduced on this account.

Confining attention to fertile unions, it remains true that we can
demonstrate no sensible difference between the size of family in
‘*limited’’ and ‘‘unlimited’’ marriages.

We thought it probable that the result could be explained by
supposing that the women who were naturally of greater than average
fertility resorted in greater proportion to the use of artificial means
and consequently emerged with an about average effective fertility.
We have failed to obtain any statistical confirmation of this, either by a
comparison of fertilities in the first years of marriage, (i.e., at an epoch
when preventive measures would be less commonly used), or by corre.

lating fertility with restriction for health constant. The schedules
did not provide for a statement as to when restrictive measures were
adopted so that an analysis of fertilities before and after the introduction of preventive measures could not be made.

It is therefore open to those who believe that the decline of the
birth rate is a ‘‘biological’’ phenomenon and little influenced by the
popularisation of anti-conceptual methods to claim our results as evidence in favour of their belief. This is not, in our opinion, the true
interpretation.

In our table of methods of limitation it will be noticed that ‘‘Continence’’ is much the largest sub-group. We have made this word
cover not only alleged complete abstention from coitus but also
its restriction to the period midway between successive menstruations.
If the reader refers to the Questionnaire reproduced in the appendix, he
will note that the interrogatory is ‘‘ was family intentionally limited ?
If so why ? and how ?’’

Logically this is exhaustive and should cover restricted intercourse. But it is to be remembered that on religious grounds many
persons distinguish sharply between restriction of coitus and such
interference ab extra as involved in the use of pessaries or sheaths. It

THE FERTILITY OF THE ENGLISH MIDDLE CLASSES. 203

is also to be remembered that in current specch artificial limitation
always means some such interference (including here coitus interruptus). We also feel considerable doubt whether persons whose
sexual appetites were almost absent or whose circumstances precluded them from intercourse would usually answer the scheduled
question in the affirmative. Hence it seems to us probable that a
large number of persons who were from the physiological point of
view restricting their fertility might bona fide enter ‘no’ in the
schedule.* We feel therefore very doubtful whether our statistical
dichotomy of ‘‘unlimited’’ and ‘‘limited’’ marriages corresponds
to a physical dichotomy. How far these doubts will be shared by
others is a matter for the judgment of our readers; we have no further
evidence to produce.

Lastly we may refer to the question whether the probable completed families of the middle class mothers studied in this investigation are sufficiently large to replace by natural generation the existing
adults of the middle class of which they are samples .t

Theoretically the solution of this problem is not difficult. If
we know the distribution of marriages, tabulated by age of husband
and age of wife at marriage, we can calculate the number of children
likely to be born if we know, (a), the chance of joint survival of husband
and wife, (b), the probability of a birth in each year of marriage. The
former can be derived from a life table, the latter from a regression
equation. An application of the method where the English Life
tables of 1911 and our equation (10) were utilised led to the conclusion that, in round numbers, 1,000 marriages would produce
3,000 children. This result is, however, inexact. The probabilities
of survival furnished by a general life table are not. properly applicable to a sample not of the general population but of the educated
middle class and the use of a linear regression equation, which involves the assumption that equal intervals of time within the fertile
period furnish equal numbers of offspring, is not correct.

But even if we waived these objections, and they are serious
objections, we have only solved the easier part of our problem. Suppose that 1,000 marriages do on the average produce 3,000 children
we have now to inquire (a) what proportion of these 3,000 children
will attain puberty and (b) what is the marriage rate of the middle classes.
It is not a mere question of whether the issue of the marriages is
sufficient to replace the parents but whether it is sufficient to replace
the parents and their coevals who die unmarried. We can solve (a)
to the same degree of approximation as the first part of the problem,
with the help of a life table, but we have no data applicable to (0).

*The work of Freud and others makes it probable that an abnormal] sexual
life is a common starting point of psycho-neuroses which are so frequent in ordinary
experience ; by abnormal is here to be understood not addiction to unnatural vice,
but quite frequently an absence of conscious sexual desire due to ‘‘unconscious’’
determinants which in many cases can be brought into consciousness by appropriate analysis. Whether this cause-group is of statistical importance, cannot
vet be determined, but the point is not to be lost sight of. —M.G.

THE FERTILITY OF THE ENGLISH MIDDLE CLASSES. 205

When this paper was first drafted, we endeavoured to reach a
solution by the method proposed by Dr. E. C. Snow.t

The profound changes of social conditions consequent upon the
war render any such calculations nugatory and they will not be reproduced. The impression we formed, that middle class fertility was
perhaps barely sufficient to maintain the absolute numbers of the class
provided the fertility rate did not further decline, may be just, but we
have too little confidence in its exactitude to express a settled opinion
and leave the general problem to be solved by future investigators.

Finally we may resume the conclusions which seem fairly
warranted by the evidence here published.

In the first place, it is plain that there is no essential difference
between the fertilities of women who have and of women who have
not received a university education. Such differences of effective fertility as appear can be fully explained by differences of age
at marriage.

In the second place, it appears that regression equations of the
first degree expressing number of children in terms of wife’s age at
marriage and duration of marriage graduate the data with sufficient
accuracy for most purposes. .

In the third place it is found that the mean size of family is small
and that a considerable proportion of the parents attempt to restrict
their fertility.

The sociological implications of these results are left for the
discussion of others. Here the personal impression is recorded
that the analysis of the sample of middle class families has led to
no result incompatible with the conclusions drawn by Professor
Karl Pearson and his collaborators from wider data of a different
kind.

Whether these results, or any results of wider analysis, suggesting that neglect of eugenic principia is leading to a steady deterioration of the race are likely to influence the reproductive habits of the
educated classes or social legislation designed to modify those habits,
is a question we need not attempt to answer.
