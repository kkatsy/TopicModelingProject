THE INHERITANCE OF BLINDNESS

The Contribution of Eugenics to the Reduction of Eye Disease
By J. MYLES BICKERTON, F.R.CS.

(A paper read to the Eugenics Society on March 15th, 19 32)

| ‘HE total world figures relating to
blindness must be of staggering
dimensions. In China, one disease
(trachoma) has been estimated to have
blinded one million in both eyes, 3 to 4
million in one eye, and to have gravely
injured 20 million—this out of a population of, say, 400,000,000.
In the United Kingdom the registered
blind were reported as follows :

TABLE I
Year. England and Scotland. Total.
Wales.
1919 25,840 — ——
1929 525727 eee —
1930 56,853 8,516 65,369
1931* 62,727 10,000 725727

Around 8,000 of these blind are also mentally defective, and many are deaf.

There has been an increase, therefore, of
35,000 odd in the registered blind in the
last twelve years, while that for the last
year was 4,126—i.e. over eleven a day. The
total figure, however, is by no means a true
indication of our blind population, for the
following groups of persons are largely
excluded, and may increase it to 250,000
blind persons :

1. Almost all blind persons of the well-todo classes.

2. Infants below school age (many die
blind).

3. Those persons who become blind after
leaving school at fourteen years or
later, until reaching blind pension age
at fifty years. Many of these persons
refuse to be certified, regarding it as
rather a disgrace.

*“ The figures for 1931 are estimates.

4. Those persons who become blind after 65
years of age are often not registered.
They obtain the old-age pension,
which is the same in amount as the
blind pension, tos. weekly. This is
a very large group, and is likely to
grow as the average length of life
increases.

5. Many blind persons of a suitable age to
obtain the blind pension, between the
ages of 50 and 65 years, do not apply
for it because they have never heard
about it.

The certification of the blind, however,
is done in a very haphazard way in this
country, and the real causation of blindness
is not truly shown, so that the figures in
Table 2 are only approximate. A child, I
should explain, is considered blind if it cannot read school books with safety to the
eyes ; while the criterion for an adult is the
capacity to do work for which eyesight is
necessary.

I have recently been on a sub-committee
which has made strong recommendations to
the Ministry of Health to improve the
registration, and if this is done, heavy blind
figures will very shortly be forthcoming.

A glance at Table 2 will show that blindness in the more active years of life is very
largely avoidable, while much of it is due
either to definitely dysgenic births or to the
unrestricted production of children in poor
or bad circumstances. In this table I have
given the groups of the blind and the percentage in each group which could, in my
opinion, be greatly reduced by the prevention of birth—since for practical purposes
bad genes and certain types of bad environment may be included together as causes of

blindness which can only be eliminated by
preventing the birth of sufferers.

TRACHOMA, 2 per cent.—This disease does
not occur in clean households (see China,
Egypt, etc.).

PURULENT CONJUNCTIVITIS, 2 per cent.—
This condition rarely occurs in clean households, and I reckon that 3 per cent. is
entirely avoidable (only one child in five is
born into a clean home in England).

OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM, 5 per cent.—
This disease, due to gonococcal infection at
birth, could and should be entirely wiped
out by the prevention of unsuitable births.

ACCIDENTS, 5 per cent.—A fair number of
these occur to infants, a fact which has considerable relevance to the limitation of

births. A woman explained in a South
London court, for instance, that she was the
only person alive and responsible for 68
children (made up by three marriages; 26
of her own children, 22 of her second
husband’s, and 20 of her last husband’s, all
other parents being dead). ‘There was
recently reported a family in Buckinghamshire of 39 children, and one woman, newly
married, had nine children in 2% years.
How can she manage, with a husband earning £3 a week?

SYPHILIS, 15 per cent.—I reckon that 10
per cent. of the syphilitic blind owe their
condition to congenital syphilis, which
might be called a ‘ pseudo-heredity ’—since
it never goes beyond the second generation
THE INHERITANCE OF BLINDNESS

—and which could be entirely eliminated by
preventing syphilitic women from having
children.

Naturally, if a woman has been shown
. (by the Schick, Wassermann tests, etc.) to
be syphilitic, she should avoid conception at
all costs, unless and until she has been completely cured. If, however, her condition
is not discovered until after conception, the
problem becomes more difficult; but treatment during pregnancy will always obtain
a non-syphilitic child if the treatment is
thorough and commenced around the fourth
month. If treatment cannot be thorough the
choice is between the birth of a congenital
syphilitic and inducing an abortion; and I,
for my part—though I know many will not
agree with me-—am_ strongly inclined
towards the latter.

Congenital syphilis, which shows itself
in the eyes anywhere between 2 and 35
(usually 5 to 25) years of age, is a slow and
terribly distressing affliction to patient,
parents, and even doctors. From two to ten
years’ treatment is often necessary before
even a quiescent stage is reached, and it
may cause blindness in three different ways
—by interstitial keratitis (or inflammation)
of the cornea, by a widespread choroiditis
with destruction of the retina, or by juvenile
optic atrophy. Needless to say, too, a congenital syphilitic is often an ament, and
is never really healthy.

In my opinion, therefore, Wassermann
(or other) tests should be compulsory in
appropriate cases, and a positive indication
should be followed by treatment, contraception, sterilization, or abortion, according to
the circumstances. I have said ‘‘ compulsory,’ but I believe that if the women of
England knew that congenital syphilis,
with all its terrible concomitants, could be
entirely eliminated, they would welcome the
appropriate routine from the medical profession. As it is, large numbers of
syphilitics mafry and produce defective
children; and at King’s College Hospital
last year 34 per cent. of the new syphilis
cases—mostly eye—were congenital.

My chief concern here, however, is with
those types of blindness which are strictly

117

hereditary—glaucoma (I per cent.), extreme
myopia (14 per cent.), senile cataract (x per
cent.), and other types (2 per cent.)—a total
of 24 per cent., or practically one quarter
of all forms of blindness. As a prelude to
discussing them, I should like to repeat the
platitude, too often forgotten, that normal
sight (emmetropia) is also hereditary, a
great number of genes being jointly at work
in its production. ‘The various departures
from normality are due to the aberration of
one or more members of this gene-complex.

GENETIC TYPES OF BLINDNESS

Heredity is the study of differences or
variations, the laws of which show that we
may all differ in three ways :

1. By modification (environment).

2. By combination in accordance with
Mendel’s laws. .

3. By mutation, the production of new
hereditary types.

In certain simple forms of life ro per
cent. of the offspring are mutations; and
according to Darwin’s law of natural selection, the best or hardiest of these varieties
survive. ‘Thus variation has a beneficial
effect on the community if the law of natural
selection is operative. The trouble in
England now is that we have dysgenic
selection.

Mutations act very well plus eugenic selection. They act fairly well plus natural
selection. They act badly minus natural
selection, and very badly plus dysgenic selection.

We must get back to natural selection
first, and then to eugenic selection. This
conclusion is logically irrefutable. Education and environment have remarkable
effects upon the individual during his lifetime, but they do not influence his hereditary equipment.

We know more about the hereditary
diseases of the eye than about those of any
other organ, and for the good reason that,
being the most important and complicated
of our sense organs, its slightest defects
cause marked disturbances of function.

The genetics of variations in normal eyecolour are too well known—though not yet
118

finally elucidated—for mention here, and
the abnormal condition of albinism is also
fairly widely - recognized as a _ simple
recessive. But the eye defects associated
with albinism are not so generally realized,
nor is it always understood that they are
really but symptoms of a general deficiency.
Practically all albinos are below the average
in health and vitality, many are aments,
and all, as a direct result of their condition,
are photo-phobic, because their eyes lack
the pigment necessary to protect the sensitive retina. The consequence is that they
hang their heads, pucker their brows, and
half-close their eyelids to shut out the
light ; and often, moreover, they suffer from
nystagmus or myopia. The incidence in the
population is I in 10,000, and 30 per cent.
of it is due—like so many similar recessives
—to consanguineous marriages.

Chart 1.

Tue Myopia Group.—The genetics of
this varied group have not been fully disentangled, but one can say for certain that
short sight never arises in the absence of
a hereditary predisposition, though that predisposition may remain latent in good health
or be accentuated by illness and physical
disability—as the myopia increases, the eye
stretches until the retina is destroyed.
Dysgenic births are the chief cause of
severe myopia, and many high myopes go
blind, while there are immense numbers
whose very defective vision is practically
equivalent to blindness, but who do not come
within the scope of the Blind Persons Act.

Without intending to imply that it is a
simple unit character, I must agree with
Clausen, who considers that myopia tends to
be recessive. Wilson, for instance, found
that in roo families with one myopic parent
there were 200 myopic children and 250 nonmyopic; while in 91 families with neither

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

parent myopic, only roo children were
myopes and 300 non-myopes.

Therefore although short-sighted offspring are often born of normal parents,
when both parents are short-sighted their
children invariably suffer from the same
defect. .

Wilson’s other figures are interesting. _
In 677 myopic children, hereditary evidence was as follows:

Uncles, aunts ... we 31
Cousins ... ves ves 9
Father to son ... we = 79

Hereditary evidence was found in:
Low myopia, up to 3 dioptres 65 per cent.

Medium, 4-6 dioptres 66 per cent.
High, 7-12 dioptres 67 per cent.
Very high, over 12 dioptres 67 per cent.

Hereditary evidence was found in the
following occupations :
THE INHERITANCE OF BLINDNESS

School children ... 65 per cent.
Home workers . 63 per cent.
Factory workers ... 68 per cent.
Clerks . 60 per cent.
Labourers 60 per cent.

The run of the figures in these last groups
indicates independence of environment.

Reference must be made here to DETACHMENT OF THE RETINA, which is a fairly
common sequel to high myopia. Bogatch
reported a family of eleven high myopes in
seven of whom detachment of the retina
supervened in one or both eyes. Retinal
detachment is found as a dominant, recessive, or male sex-linked in different pedigrees.

In the same way, ASTIGMATISM, LONG
SIGHT, AND Sguint (which is often associated with long sight), may be inherited.
Squint, from which more than 2 per cent.
of school children suffer, is responsible for
a large number of blind eyes.

due to hereditarily determined atrophy of

in the Treasury of Human Inheritance.
The condition begins in early youth ana
progresses to complete blindness sooner or
later, often around forty years of age. As
in other diseases, there are several torms,
as shown by their differing heredity, the
commonest being recessive—33 per cent. of
those thus affected owe their condition to
consanguinity. In some families the condition is linked with deafness.

Optic NERVE ATROPHY AND OPTIC
NEuRITIS.—These frequently cause blindness, and the hereditary variety is well
recognized by ophthalmologists, 1,000 pediI2Z0
grees being available for study. 85 per
cent. of those affected are males. The

disease comes on at different ages, the
average being about twenty. Diminution
of vision is the chief symptom and often
appears suddenly; there is a_ central
scotoma, and after six months or so the
disease remains stationary. The malady
has been traced once through six generations, twice through five generations, and
often through four generations.

LEBER’S Optic ATROPHY is a name for
the sex-linked variety. It appears to be an
a-biotrophy, or lack of vital force, occurring
at the prime of life.

Optic atrophy occurs also in another
hereditary disease, FRIEDREICH’S ATAXIA,
which is a severe recessive ataxia. It is
very crippling, but the patients live to old
age and are a great burden on their relatives (or on the State). A study of all cases

shows that a common ancestor is probable ;
and it is by no means improbable that all
those in Switzerland derive ultimately from
a common source. It is certainly found
most frequently in remote valleys where
inbreeding has been common.

There is a dominant ataxia, cerebellar
ataxia, or MARIE’S DISEASE.

ANIRIDIA (absence of the iris) —All such
cases that I have seen have been of blind
standard. I particularly wish to call attention to the Risley pedigree (1915) of
aniridia. One blind man with aniridia, had

13 children similarly affected (100 per

cent.),

61 grandchildren out of 63,

39 great-grandchildren out of 42—

114 blind out of 119 (Chart 14).

CONGENITAL CATARACTS AND  SENILE
Cataracts (Charts 15-17). — These are
usually dominant, and are very important,
Macklin stating that 13 per cent. of the
pupils in blind schools are blind through
cataract, and Hirst giving Io per cent. in
1,300 blind persons (anophthalmia and
microphthalmia came next).

GLAUCcOMA.—In this group the hereditary
factor is not always very marked, though
congenital glaucoma does occur, and there
is a probable hereditary predisposition to
it in many other cases. This is known as
hereditary anaphylaxis, or abiosis—a lack
of vital force which causes the structure to
die before its time. Many pedigrees suggest a dominant heredity, but the hereditary
course is occasionally interrupted, and
casual causes are often necessary to bring
out the disease. It may arise early in life
as a juvenile glaucoma, and ostensible
anticipation is known to occur, though this
can be explained by unintentional statistical
selection. Occasionally glaucoma is recessive, and appears then to be common in
Jews, among whom consanguinity is fairly
frequent.

BLuE ScLEROTICS.—This is a condition in
which the coat of the eye is too thin or too
transparent, accompanied by a failure in
development of connective tissues. It is
often associated with fragilitas ossium, or
brittle bones, and with a type of deafness
due to oto-sclerosis. The female is more
likely both to show and to transmit it.

Seventy-three pedigrees since 1903 show
463 defective individuals; it is usually
dominant.

Giioma.—This is a rare malignant
growth, occurring in infants, of the nerve
elements of the eye, which in some families
shows a strong hereditary tendency, and is
apparently recessive. It usually affects
both eyes, and their early removal is
necessary to save life. Some sufferers survive, marry, and often transmit the defect.
Bell found 128 cases in 36 pedigrees;
Clausen’s sibships showed 83 affected and
61 unaffected. Mohr considers the condition to be lethal in a homozygous condition.

The death of a child with glioma of the
retina is an appalling experience for parents
and child, and may take as long as two
years. ‘The law which forces us to with
123

hold euthanasia in these cases, and at the
same time forces us to act in a barbarous
and monstrously inhuman fashion, is, in my
opinion, indefensible.

MAcuLO-CEREBRAL DEGENERATIONS. —
Several conditions might be described under
this heading, including the rare disease of
the central nervous system known as
amaurotic family idiocy. Commencing at
about five or seven years of age, the children go blind within two years and mentally
degenerate within the next two; death occurs
around 17-18 years. Amaurotic family
dementia is a diffuse tapeto-retinal degeneration causing total, or nearly total,
blindness, beginning at birth or later, and

At dusk these cases are blind, though their

SOME SUGGESTED REMEDIES

Crude though effective methods for the
relief of suffering have been practised in
many parts of the world. A Chinese potentate, for instance, the ruler of a province,
whose soul was torn by the sufferings of the
lepers in his State, consulted with his
officials. It was decided that he should call
THE INHERITANCE OF BLINDNESS

together all the lepers from far and wide,
to a banquet where amidst beautiful flowers
and music, and plied with unlimited quantities of food and wine, they soon became
oblivious to life and to their infirmities. At
this stage the banqueting hall was set on
fire, and next day all was lovely once more,
pain and suffering had been banished from
his State. This is a true story. The
Esquimaux eliminate unwanted children.
In Brazil, surplus children are sold into
service without undue hardship to them or
their parents; but in England, on the
coldest night for three years (in February
1932), a child was left on a doorstep in
Esher, Surrey, near the richest city in the
world.

Our problem to-day is how to make the
essential humanity of these principles conform to the sentiment of our time. Fortunately, our knowledge of the laws of
biology—which are just as much the laws
of God as those which govern the motions
of the -planets—enables us to reduce hereditary suffering just as effectively as did the
more drastic methods of other times and
countries.

A racial defect can be eliminated just as
thoroughly by the sterility of its bearers as
by their death; and I am therefore in the
fullest sympathy with this Society’s campaign to prevent the procreation of aments
and the social problem group.

My concern in this article, however, is
with the hereditary blind who, indeed,
present an easier problem. They should not
only be allowed, but encouraged, to marry,
but on the one condition that by birth control, sterilization, or abortion, they avoid
having children. I am aware that many
members of this Society will disapprove of
my advocacy of the last method, and it is
only my own opinion that it is suitable for
certain cases. I also consider that the law
should not force a pregnant woman, as it
does at present, to have a child against her
wish—especially as this law is no more
effective than those against the sale of
sweepstake tickets in England or alcohol in
the U.S.A.

125

No woman with active syphilis should be
allowed to have a child.

Euthanasia for infants with gross defects
might be available for parents who wish to
make use of it—though here, again, I
realize that all eugenists may not agree with
me.

The other reforms I most wish to see are
exactly those advocated by the Eugenics
Society—the teaching of biology to all
children and young persons, the formation
of biological health centres or of national
constructive birth-control clinics, and the
active co-operation of the medical profession
in the eugenics movement, which should be
looked upon as a form of preventive
medicine.

WHAT HAS—AND MIGHT BE—DONE

I have here indicated some—among many
—methods which would prevent much needless suffering. Those who think that there
is something to be said for action along
these lines, but who fear lest public opinion
may be difficult to move, may remember the
past fights—some of them very recent—
which have been won.

1. The washing of the body was regarded
by devout Christians as a heathen custom,
dangerous to the believer, in the time of
Philip II of Spain, who had all the Moorish
baths destroyed.

2. About the year 1780, Hanway invented
the umbrella, which was considered by
many as an unjustifiable interference with
the laws of God.

3. My father-in-law tells me he remembers young children, both girls and boys,
being forced up chimneys to sweep them.
Some were choked and suffocated and others
roasted ; but Bill after Bill was rejected by
our eminent gentlemen in Parliament, and
it was not until the jointed brush was
invented that a stop was put to this practice.

4. Bills brought before Parliament for the
prevention of animal torture at fairs, and
at times of public holidays, were greeted
with laughter and ridicule, and the practice
did not cease until 1830 or thereabouts.

5. Bills for the prevention of cruelty to
children were opposed on the grounds that
126

they were seeking to interfere unwarrantably with the rights of parents. At this
time the frightful conditions of child labour
were considered unavoidable.

6. Hickman, who originated experiments
in anzesthesia about 1822, was refused permission to read a paper before the Royal
Society when Sir Humphry Davy was President. When anzsthesia was first introduced to relieve the pangs of childbirth, the
pulpits, even up to 1847, resounded with
denunciations of this practice on the grounds
that this was interfering with the punishment of woman for her share in the original
sin.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

7. When Darwin’s Origin of Species was
published, the religious opposition was
frantic.

The present prospects of the eugenic
movement are certainly far better than were
those of the reforms I have mentioned,
especially since the practical proposals suggested here and by others are fully in accord
with the sentiment of the day. They would
reduce much suffering and cause none, and
should therefore especially appeal to the
religious bodies of this country—who have
now a finer opportunity than ever before of
capturing the imagination of the people and
of guiding the ethics of the community.
