The English Speaking Commonwealth

SOME DEMOGRAPHIC FACTS

"| POPULATIONS OF Australia, Canada and New Zealand, when taken
together, amount to well over one-half
of the population of the United Kingdom. The
English speaking part of the Commonwealth
(if these territories may be so described) now
consists, therefore, of more than eighty million
persons, a number substantial enough to bear in
mind as a major factor when considering Common Market aims and related problems.

Forty years ago, the three overseas territories
named above contained only a third as many
people as the home country. The details of their
rise in population to nearly two-thirds of that
of the United Kingdom may be seen from the
following table:

YEAR
1920 1960
(Numbers in millions)
United Kingdom 524
Australia 5+ 10
Canada 9 18
New Zealand 1 24
The three Overseas Territories
together 154 304

While, therefore, the home numbers have
increased by only one-fifth, there has been a
doubling overseas.

The respective average rates of growth have
thus been about one-half per cent and a little
under 2 per cent per annum during the last
four decades. At the present time the corresponding rates are 0-4 and 2:5 per cent respectively.

The analysis of these figures for 1960 is as
follows:

UNITED NEW
Per thousand KINGDOM AUSTRALIA CANADA ZEALAND
Crude birth rate 17 23 27 26
Crude death rate 12 9 8 9
Net rate of natural
increase 5 14 19 17
Net migrationrate â€” 8 + 8 3
Total growth rate 5 22 27 22

The mean expectation of life at birth is close
to seventy for all four countries, and the difference in the crude death rates (and also to a
small extent in the crude birth rates) are attributable to disparities in age-distribution, as may be
seen from the following figures:

The area of Australia, Canada and New
Zealand taken together is about seventy times as
great as that of the United Kingdom and the
average population density is 100 times lower.
Even so, many of the people of the overseas
territories live in urban areas of high density,
and their marriage, divorce and fertility experience is similar to that of the United Kingdom.
