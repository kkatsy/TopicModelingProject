THE BERLIN POPULATION CONGRESS AND
RECENT POPULATION MOVEMENTS |
IN GERMANY*

give a complete account of the Berlin
Population Congress. With the meetings
of the four different divisions being held at
the same time, it was difficult to cover more
than one, and though I occasionally attended
the sessions on Population Biology, and on
Social, Economic and Psychological Problems, my remarks are in the main confined to
the papers read at the plenary meetings and
at those of the Population Statistics section.
Nevertheless, conversations with other delegates showed that the disappointments which
I encountered in my own section were repeated in theirs, so that this report possibly
applies to the Congress as a whole as well as
to one part ofit. If that is the case, then from
the scientific point of view the Congress was
not altogether a success.
The purpose of a scientific congress is, as I
see it, to keep workers in a particular field of
“investigation in touch with the most recent
developments therein, especially by discussions of those questions on which further
light needs to be thrown. But at the Berlin
Congress there was no real discussion,
largely because there was no time for it. At
conferences of this nature, the papers should
be and frequently are distributed beforehand,
and the speakers may assume that the audience is conversant with the matters to be
considered. But on this occasion only
synopses of the papers were available, and
these but a few minutes before the sessions
were due to begin. Add the fact that eleven
or more papers were read at each sectional
meeting, and it is easy to see why there was
no time to consider their contents. This was
a pity, for a good deal of debatable material
was read.

* Mr. D. V. Glass attended this Congress on behalf
of the EUGENICS SOCIETY.

That brings me to the second point—the
quality of the papers themselves. Apart
from numerous instances of prejudice, which
I shall mention later, what struck me most
forcibly was the staleness of so many of the
papers. Dr. Burgdorfer, for example, naturally gave a very sound analysis of nineteenth
and twentieth-century population developments ; but surely every serious student of
population problems must have been familiar
with these beforehand. True, the most recent
events in Germany are of great interest and
we need all the information we can obtain
about them; but, instead of providing any
new material, Dr. Burgdorfer gave less than
anyone could have read before in at least five
of his articles, as wellas in his excellent book.*
The same criticism applies to Monsieur F.
Boverat’s paper on “‘ La péréquation des
ressources aux charges de famille.” It was
interesting, but it had already appeared in
the form of a pamphlet entitled, ‘‘ Les
encouragements matériels 4 la natalité,’’
which was published in 1934.

The fact that these papers were read at
plenary sessions is, perhaps, some excuse for
their nature, but even at the sectional meetings most speakers appeared to assume that
the audience knew very little of what had
been happening to population in the last
hundred years. There was, for instance, no
mention of Dr. Leybourne’s or Dr. Charles’s
estimates of future population, nor of Dr.
Kuczynski’s new method of showing true
mortality rates. Dr. Wieth-Knudsen of
Drontheim analysed trends in the Scandinavian countries without speaking of Myrdal’s new book or analysing the social .
measures which the Swedish Government
is undertaking to combat the fall in the

birth-rate ; while Monsieur Serpeille de Gobineau merely formulated another version of
the Malthusian principle. Nor was the information on Hungary and Poland much
more valuable.

In the long list of papers to which I
listened, I can remember only three of real
interest—that of Dr. Linder of the Swiss
Statistical Office, which gave the results of
the first fertility investigation in Switzerland,
showing the net reproduction index for the
country to be only 0-84; that of Dr.
Winkler of Vienna, giving the results of the
1934 Austrian census, according to which the
average number of children per marriage in
Austria was only 1:8; and that of Dr.
Griesmeier of Stuttgart, which gave the conclusions drawn from the 1934 Wiirttemberg
inquiry into the distribution of the increase
of births by social and vocational status in
town and country.

RACE AND POLITICS

It is perhaps not surprising, apart from the
intellectual poverty of the material presented, that the dominant note at this conference—despite the auspices under which it
was held—should have been the manifestations of race prejudice, not all of which were
confined to the German delegates. The
International Population Union expressly
states that its object is the scientific study
of population problems, unadulterated by
political and other dogmas. This organization, to quote from the EUGENICS REVIEW
of July 1935 (p. 147), “‘ is bound to confine
itself strictly to scientific investigation, and
to refuse to enter upon religious, moral or
political discussions.”’ If that isso, then much
that was read at the Berlin Congress should
have been excluded.

With the racial fantasies of the German
delegates I am not much concerned, since
their professed faith is well known, but it is,
I think, worth while to quote from speeches
of the other delegates. Dr. Stigler of Vienna,
for example, gave a paper on “ State Matrimonial Agencies,” in which the following
statement occurred :

“Inter-marriages with Jews are of equal
disadvantage for both parties from reasons of racial

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

physiology—quite apart from the instinctive
reasons against such marriages. The offspring of
these marriages often show, it is true, a so-called
‘luxuriance’ in the first generation, but subsequent generations tend to reveal, in a striking
number of cases, grave signs of degeneration,
particularly in psychiatric respects.”

Dr. Alois Scholtz, headmaster of a boarding-school near Vienna, used similar arguments for urging racial political education in
schools, such as that initiated in Germany by
the decree of January 1935. Perhaps the
most emphatic paper on these lines was that
on “* Nordic and ‘ Verbal ’ Culture ”’ given by
Professor E. B. Almquist of Stockholm,
from whose summary it is interesting to
quote at length.

“Verbal (i.e. non-Nordic) culture is characterized by more or less set doctrines, and by words
and formule. Some of these are even sacred. The
doctrines differ, but all of them are fairly rigid. . . .
Here we do not encounter our (Nordic) respect for
reality and the actual facts. Scholasticism has
remained their science; they speculate, explain
things hypothetically, and speak of cause and
effect, even with regard to religious questions. ...
Like all convinced dogmatists these (non-Nordic)
men feel themselves to be superior and seek forcibly
to convey their doctrines to others. In doing so,
they demand solidarity. Hence they try, when
organizing other peoples, to enslave them and convert them into collective masses. We Nordics are
shunned by them as dangerous. . . . The history
of the Middle Ages has been misrepresented by
history-writing prelates who were not allowed to
present the true facts. It is now even asserted that
the documents in question were intentionally
falsified at the end of the Middle Ages.”’

Much of this is rather difficult to understand, but what place has any of it at a
screnti fic conference on population problems ?

One handicap to the Congress was that
many of the authorities who spoke at the
previous general assembly of the Union in
1931 did not attend this one, while others
who did attend took no part in the proceedings. In particular, the United States
section apparently boycotted the Congress,
their only delegate being Professor Hankins
of Smith College, who held a “ watchingbrief ’’ but did not read a paper.* This was
rather unfortunate for it meant that Dr.
Clarence Campbell, the only American

* See New York Times, August 30th, 1935.
GERMAN POPULATION MOVEMENTS

speaker, was assumed to be the official
American representative. His paper at the
second plenary meeting, on ‘“‘ The Biological
Postulates of Population Study,’’ was a model
of Nordic self-approbation, and since he was
described by the Vd6lkische Wille* as the
President of the American Eugenics Society
(a position which I can find no record of his
holding) his paper carried a good deal of
weight in Germany. The intellectual temper
of the Conference was most clearly displayed
when Dr. Dalsace, a French delegate, read a
paper against compulsory sterilization. It
was almost followed by a riot, but still there
was no discussion!

THE STIMULATION OF MARRIAGE- AND
BIRTH-RATES

But now, since the main reason for my
visit to Berlin was to collect material on the
present population position in Germany, I
should like to give a very brief account of
recent developments.t Readers of the
EUGENICS REVIEW are aware that since
June 1933, when Dr. Frick gave his address
to the population and race-political experts
gathered together in Berlin, the German
Government has initiated a large number of
measures to stimulate marriage- and birthrates in the country.{ These measures cover
a very wide field, ranging from such small
aids as the transference of mothers and
expectant mothers to better-class railway
carriages during the “rush hours,’ to
important modifications in the inheritance
and income-tax laws in favour of large
families. They include giving preference to

* Volkische Wille, September 5th, 1935.

¢ I must emphasize in advance that my analysis of
German population movements is by no means a
general criticism of the statements made by Dr.
Burgdorfer or by the government officials connected
with the application of the various National-Socialist
measures for encouraging population growth. On the
contrary, it is based largely on material which these
have kindly allowed me to use. All the officials admit
explicitly that the increase in marriages and births in
1933 and 1934 was due, to a significant extent, to
specially favourable circumstances. My criticism is
concerned only with particular points of interpretation.

the heads of large families when allotting
places in the central and local Government
medical service and in the distribution of jobs
by labour exchanges, as well as the provision
of child-allowances by individual towns, the
institution of a family-allowance system for
doctors and dentists employed in clinics, and
the settlement of workers’ families in newly
built villages provided with small holdings
and allotments.

Since, however, most of these measures
did not come into force until late in 1934,
they could scarcely have had any part in
raising the marriage- and birth-rates to the
extent shown in Table I. The Act that has
probably had the greatest influence in that
direction is that of July 1933 (coming into
force August 1933) for the provision of
marriage loans. Under this Act, 150 million
marks per year are to be spent in giving loans
to some 275,000 couples who wish to marry,
but who cannot themselves afford to furnish
a home and buy the necessary household
equipment. The grant is obtained from
revenue raised by means of income-tax and
the loans, which at the maximum are I,000
marks (the average loan for the period August
Ist, 1933, to February 28th, 1934, was 620
marks) are given in the form of coupons
which may be exchanged at various shops for
certain kinds of household goods—furniture,
linen, kitchen utensils, wireless sets, and so
forth.

THE INFLUENCE OF MARRIAGE LOANS

The idea of the Act is twofold—not only to
encourage marriage, but also to withdraw
women from industry and commerce and so
to provide more employment for men. In
fact it is hoped that by this means 200,000
employed women will be replaced by men
each year.* Consequently the loans are given
only when the women to be married have
been employed for at least nine months in
the previous two years.f Allthese regulations
imply that, although no upper income limit

* It is also hoped to stimulate the various household
goods industries by confining the expenditure of the
loans to products of these types.

t If the woman has been engaged in household tasks
at home, the grant of the loan is conditional upon her
replacement, when married, by a domestic servant.

is stipulated, the Act applies only to the
working class and to the lower middle class ;*
it is important to bear this fact in mind when
analysing the increase in births. The couples
who borrow the money have to repay at the
rate of I per cent. per month—no interest is
charged—and an inducement to have children early is given by the clause that a quarter
of the initial loan is cancelled with the birth
of each child. Note also that the loans are to
be discontinued at the end of 1938, after
which date repayments will be used to
provide various child welfare services. t
Returning to the population movements,
the table below shows that the marriage-rate
has risen almost continuously since the
second quarter of 1933, and that the birthrate has been rising since the first quarter of
1934. By the end of 1934 there was an
increase of 343,075 marriages as compared
with 1932, while during the same period the
number of births increased by 203,311. That

is, the marriage-rate began to increase before

the Act for providing marriage loans had
actually come into force. The increase in
births began considerably later, and the
birth-rate for 1933 was, in fact, lower than
that of the previous year.

* Applicants must fulfil eleven racial, domiciliary,
and medical requirements. In particular they must be
“ Aryans ” and have no taint of hereditary illness.

Chapters I-III; Peretti, “‘ Zusammenstellung der
bevolkerungspolitischen Massnahmen in Deutschland ”’
(Archiv fiir Bevdlkerungswissenschaft, August 1935) ;

Vermégensteuergesetz von 16 Oktober and Einkommensteuergesetz (both published by the Reichsfinanzministerium) ; also Eviduterungen zum Gesetz tiber Forderung
dey Eheschliessungen (pamphlet issued by the Reichsminister der Finanzen, Feb. 1935). It should be remembered that the race-biological motif runs through all
these measures so that they apply only to “ Aryans,’’
and, further, only to those “‘ Aryans’”’ who are not
carriers of an inheritable disease.

+ Dr. Burgdorfer (‘‘ Der Kampf um die Wiedergeburt
des Volkes und seine Erfolgaussichten,”’ Archiv, October
1934) explains the low birth-rate of 1933 as due to the
decrease in the number of illegitimate births, which in
turn was caused by the abnormally low number of
females aged nineteen years. Legitimate births had
only dropped from 864,379 to 856,000. But note that
between August 1933 and January 1934 there were
13,603 loan-repayment cancellations in respect of the

The question is, what factors have been
responsible for the change in the situation ?
Dr. Burgdérfer’s analysis at the Population
Congress was as follows:

“This change is no doubt partly due to the
various forms of State-action to encourage population growth. In particular the granting of marriage
loans has stimulated the marriage- and birth-rates.
Sixty per cent. of the increase in births comes from
marriages which were concluded with the help of
loans. But these external measures are not the sole
reason for the change. The decisive factor is the
new outlook brought about by the nationalsocialist revolution, the fundamental transformation of the political and intellectual (gezstigen)
atmosphere, the improvement in the economic
situation, clearly shown in the fall of unemployment from over six millions to one and threequarter millions, in short, the return of confidence
on the part of the people in the political and
economic government of the nation.’’f

While it is impossible to subject all these
suggestions to an exact scrutiny, some of
them, at least, can be analysed more

closely.
We must immediately acknowledge that

birth of children. But for the marriage loans some of
these births would have been illegitimate, while others
would have been prevented by abortion.

* The figures are from Burgdorfer’s Bevélkerungsentwicklung im Dritten Reich, and the rates of increase
have been computed from them.

+ Burgdorfer, ‘‘ Bevélkerungsentwicklung im abendlautischen Kulturkreis mit besonderer Beriicksichtigung
Deutschlands.”’ I have not been able to find statistics
showing an improvement in the economic situation.
Foreign trade has declined considerably, while the
reduction in the unemployment figure is at least partly
due to the transference of unemployed workers to
labour camps.
GERMAN POPULATION MOVEMENTS

marriage loans have very probably played an
important part in changing the position. For
many members of the working-class and of
the lower middle-class, a loan of 1,000 marks
to be repaid in ten years is, if not a positive
inducement, at least a factor helping to
remove some of the barriers to an intended
marriage. The effect is, therefore, to speed
up marriages and thus also first births. But
there are other points to be considered in this
connection. In the first place we cannot say,
as Dr. Burgdorfer has done, that the loans
are responsible for 60 per cent. of the increase
in births. True, the couples who received
loans produced 182,355 children between
August 1933 and April 1935, but there is no
way of estimating how many of these children
would have been born if there had been no
loans. And secondly, we cannot tell how
many marriages were only concluded because
of the provision of loans, although there are
two facts which throw some light on these
problems.

OTHER FACTORS CONCERNED

The years 1930 to 1932 saw a marked
falling-off in the marriage-rate, due partly, at
any rate, to the economic depression. Taking
into account the age-composition of the
population and the marriage-rates in previous
years, there was, by the end of 1932, a deficit
of some 330,000 marriages.* But most of
these marriages had only been postponed,
and Dr. Burgdoérfer himself quotes the
proverb, ‘‘ Aufgehoben ist nicht geschoben.”
Even without the provision of loans there
might, consequently, have been a considerable increase in the number of marriages in
1933 and 1934. There is no justification for
saying that the increase of 343,075 marriages
in 1933 and 1934 was entirely or even mainly
brought about by the “ Gesetz tiber Forderung der Eheschliessungen,’’ merely because 366,178 loans were granted in the same
period.

The second fact is this: Dr. Griesmeier’s
investigation in Wiirttemberg shows that the
increase in births which took place in 1934
and 1935 was common to all economic

classes, and not confined to those whose
members received marriage loans. The birthrates by classes are given in Table II, and

are calculated as the number of live births

per 1,000 married men twenty to fifty years
of age.*

In so far as it is possible to compare the whole
of 1934 with the first quarter of the next year,
the rate of increase is greatest among the
salaried class, not among the workers. Dr.
Griesmeier maintains that in respect of
employment and the age and sex composition
of the population, Wiirttemberg is typical of
Germany in general, so that it is probable
that similar rates of increase are to be found
in other parts of the country.

THE DECLINE IN ABORTION

Looking more closely at the general increase in births, we find that the decrease in
abortion must have been a very important
factor. The extent to which abortion has
fallen off is indicated by the examples given
in the tables below, and the fall must have
been due in part, at least, to the granting of
marriage loans.

Between August 1933 and March 1934
there were part-cancellations of loans in
respect of the birth of 43,101 children, who
must have been conceived before marriage,
and referring to this, an article in Wirtschaft
und Statistik (March 2nd, 1935) acknowledges
that ‘“‘ Ein gewiss nicht geringer Teil diesen
Geburten durch Abtreibung verhindert worden waren, wenn die Eltern der Kinder nicht
durch die Gewahrung von Ehestandsdarlehen in die Lage versetzt worden waren, zu
heiraten oder ihr Heirat zu beschleunigen.”’

* Dr. Griesmeier, ‘‘ Die Geburtenhaufigkeit in Wiirttemberg im Jahre 1934 und imersten Vierteljahr 1935,
nach Beruf und Soziales Stellung.’’ Dr. Griesmeier very
kindly gave me a copy of his paper.

have had a positive success, particularly as
they are reinforced by an increased severity

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE

But whatever the reasons for the increase
in births, the fact remains that the population situation in Germany showed a marked
improvement in 1934. In that year, for the
first time since 1926, the number of births
was sufficient to maintain the population at
its existing numbers. According to the
method which Dr. Burgd6érfer explained in
his book Der Geburtenriickgang und seine
Bekampfung (1929), the annual number of
live births necessary for keeping a stationary
population of 65-579 millions—the mid-year
population of Germany in 1934—is 1-072
million.* Since the actual number of live
births for that year was 1-181 million, a more
than adequate replacement had been provided.

But this does not mean that the potentially
fertile female population was replacing itself.
On the contrary, a stationary population of
62:579 millions, given the mortality rates

-shown by the 1933 German Life Table,

would contain only 14-1 million women aged
15 to 45 years, instead of the 16-112 millions
present in 1934. Nor is there any assurance
that the annual numbers of live births in the
future will be sufficient even to maintain
the 1934 total population. Apart from the
question of how much effect the government’s
measures have had and how long that effect
will last, there is the fact that the number of
potentially fertile women is declining every
year. So that to maintain a constant annual
number of births means an ever-increasing
fertility—a state of affairs that is contrary to
the experience of the last sixty years.
