Assortative Mating in Man

YHEN THE THEORETICAL foundations
\ \ / of population genetics were worked out
in the beginning of this century, hardly
any empirical examples of Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium situations were known in man.
During the last decades, however, a large number
of polymorphisms have been detected. These
marker systems, which are almost exclusively
confined to biochemical-physiological traits have
provided empirical verifications of the existence
of Hardy-Weinberg equilibria and random
mating in human populations. On the basis of
the information collected the view has generally
been developed that although slight deviations
from panmixia certainly exist in human populations, they are probably of such a low degree
that they should not give rise to any detectable
rearrangements of the genotype distributions.
However, we still have very little knowledge
about the occurrence of deviations from random
mating in man.

The Historical Background
When analysing the family records compiled
by Sir Francis Galton, Pearson found a correlation with respect to stature between marriage
partners, which encouraged him to undertake
the well-known classical study of assortative
mating for stature, span and forearm in 1903.14
The correlation coefficients were of a magnitude
of about 0-2, the highest being found for stature.
In another paper Pearson (anonymously, 1902)
discussed the principal effect of assortative
mating compared to inbreeding and also gave
evidence for the existence of assortative mating
for a character such as length of life.

Since these first studies very few workers have
been interested in collecting empirical data
showing the existence and magnitude of assorta

tive mating. This fact has been pointed out by
Dahlberg.?* The theoretical implications of
assortative mating have, however, attracted
several investigators including Wright in 1921
and Dahlberg in 1947. .

During the last few years a new interest in
problems concerning assortative mating is discernible. Thus, Darlington®»* has stressed the
importance of assortative mating with respect to
fertility. We, at the Institute for Medical Genetics
in Uppsala, have taken up studies of assortative
mating of which some results will be presented
in this communication.

It may be convenient for several reasons to
treat separately assortative mating for physical,
mental and demographical traits.

After an analysis of cross assortative mating
Pearson concluded that there was evidence that
not only direct selection for these three characters had taken place, but that the similarity
between wife and husband concerning span and
forearm was not solely dependent on a selection
of stature.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW, July 1962, 54, 2.
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

It is interesting to compare these figures with
some data from the Swedish Lapps presented by
Elston in 1961.’ For three different anthropometric traits much the same correlation coefficients were found. The nomadic Swedish Lapps
constitute a rather small, fairly homogeneous
group with little admixture of other race groups.
They have a low mean stature and the cephalic
index is considerably higher than in Swedes.?

There is no great difference between the three
traits with respect to the correlation coefficients.
One would have expected to find a much more
pronounced association for a trait like stature
than for cephalic index. It is very unlikely that
such slight differences of head shape as those
here concerned, may be perceived and used as
a basis for the selection of the marriage partner.
It seems more probable that selection has taken
place according to Lappish race type as a
whole, so that more typical Lapps mate more
often than chance would indicate.

Not all studies of assortative mating for
stature have given statistically significant results.
Table 1 also includes data by Furusho (1961),°
who found no conclusive evidence for assortative mating in a study from Japan.

_ For eye-colour Pearson and Lee‘ reported a
correlation between wives and husbands of
0-10 + 0-04. In a sample from Uppsala Elston’
also found evidence for assortative mating
according to eye-colour (Table 2). The indi

no room for doubting the existence of assortative mating with respect to eye-colour.

When analysing the occurrence of assortivate
mating for eye-colour in a sample of Swedish
Lapps, I found no evidence for a correlation
between wives and husbands (Table 3). In this

study which was based on the primary data
published by Dahlberg and Wahlund? in 1941,
the classifications were also made by means of a
fixed scale (Martin). In the Lapps a large number
of individuals have brown eyes and very few
have clearly blue eyes. The lack of a correlation
for eye-colour may in part depend on the fact
that most of the individuals in the category of
light or mixed eyes actually have rather dark
eyes and thus that the variability in respect to
eye-colour is less than in the sample of Swedes,
which makes discrimination according to eyecolour less efficient in the Lappish group.

The low degree of correlation for eye-colour
in the Lapps is, however, still rather surprising
in view of the strong association for hair colour
found between mates in the same material

ASSORTATIVE MATING IN MAN

Assortative Mating and Mental Traits

We can also expect to find evidence for
assortative mating for different mental characters. Thus with respect to mental capacity there
must be a rather strong correlation between
mates. Dahlberg wrote in 1947: “We can
suspect musical persons of marrying one another
particularly often, and, generally, expect hereditary characters of importance for special interests
to make for a certain degree of assortative mating; interests unite people.”

Elston in his study of assortative mating in a
sample from Uppsala also included different
mental traits. He has kindly supplied some
unpublished data® relating to correlation for
musicality between wives and husbands (Table
5). The individuals were classified into two

groups; those who had manifested musical
interest by playing an instrument (before
marriage) and those who had not. The former
group was operationally termed musical and the
latter non-musical.

There is a very strong association between
married individuals concerning “musical interest.” Someone may find it astonishing that
as much as about 30 per cent of the individuals
were able to play an instrument. This surely
depends on the fact that Uppsala is a rather
small town, that to a large extent is dominated
by the university and thus that a fairly large
proportion of the individuals have a high degree
of education.

As “musical interest” and ability to play an
instrument certainly may be correlated with
educational group and social group, it is evident
that the classification used above does not show
the potential musicality of the individuals. It is

also possible that the correlation found is a
“secondary” one depending on assortative
mating for educational group. This question will
be elucidated in a forthcoming study.

Assortative Mating and Demographic Traits
Perhaps the most interesting aspects of assortative mating are those concerning demographic
traits, such as length of life, fertility and mobility. As long ago as 1903 Pearson made a study
of correlation between husband and wife in
respect to length of life. Data were collected
from two fairly limited rural districts (Wensleydale and adjacent dales and the villages round
Oxford) and one limited class (the Society of
Friends). In all three cases a correlation coefficient of about 0-2 was obtained with a mean of
0-2233. After having discussed the possible
influence by local or class variations and
environmental factors Pearson concluded: “We
are thus forced to conclude that the correlation
actually observed between the length of life in
two married persons is a measure of a real
tendency towards homogamy, comparable with
other cases of assortative mating.”

Darlington®.* has pointed out the importance
of assortative mating for fertility. He studied
the offspring of individuals who had been married both to a cousin and to an unrelated
individual. These “‘double-marriage” families
were also classified into outbred and inbred
families, according to the occurrence of consanguineous marriages in the previous generations. When analysing the variations in the
numbers of children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren in these families Darlington found
that inbreeders suffer by outbreeding and outbreeders by inbreeding. A decrease of fecundity
was found not only in the first generation, but
also in the second and third generations.
Darlington stated that this phenomenon could
only be explained as an effect of assortative
mating for fertility “individuals with low
fertility marry spouses with low fertility.”

It is reasonable to assume that low fertility
to a large extent depends on the integrated effect
of a number of lethal genes or genes decreasing
the general vitality. Thus, if assortative mating
according to fertility exists in human populations
it would mean a selection against a large number

65
THE EUGENICS REVIEW

of deleterious genes, for, as Darlington points
out, the effect of assortative mating for fertility
in consecutive generations is cumulative and
hence some families may become extinct in a few
generations.

Darlington’s statements were based on the
results from the “double-marriage” families
only, and no data showing the correlation
between mates concerning familial fecundity
were presented.

Beckman and Elston! have studied the correlation between wife and husband in respect to
familial fecundity as measured by the number of
sibs. The individuals were classified into two
groups: those who had less than four sibs and
those who had four or more. Table 6 seems to

show that there is rather strong evidence for the
occurrence of positive assortative mating for
sibship size. When the total material was subdivided according to the year of birth of the
individuals, however, it became evident that the
correlation between mates concerning sibship
size is most likely a “‘secondary” phenomenon
(Table 7). The average number of children has

decreased markedly during the last century.
Thus older individuals in this sample have on the
average more sibs than the younger ones. The
very strong assortative mating for age has then
created the results observed and thus we may not
conclude that there exists any sort of selective
process (conscious or unconscious) in respect
to the number of sibs of a prospective marriage
partner. Assortative mating for social groups
may also create similar “‘false” correlations since
it is a well-known fact that the average number
of children differs between social groups. Most
investigators have discussed sources of bias due
to local or class variations, while the variations
by time have mostly been forgotten. As Beckman
and Elston! have pointed out, the time trend in
respect to average length of life may explain the
correlations found by Pearson in 1903 for length
of life between wives and husbands, for the data
were collected overalong period of time. (Tombstone records were used.) When selecting a very
small geographical area to exclude the influence
of local variations, it was naturally impossible
to find a sufficient number of married couples
from a limited period of time.

We may thus conclude that in studies of
assortative mating for demographic traits one is
likely to obtain positive results simply because
of the time trend existing for most of these
characteristics. Most correlation coefficients
have a curious tendency to fall close to 0-2,
which is not to be expected since the intensity
of selection should be different for various traits.
I do not mean to say that a coefficient of 0-2 is
what the time trend would give, but it is certainly
operating behind many figures. We must then
recall that the average stature in Sweden has
increased by about 10 centimetres during the
last century and thus when collecting data on
married couples of different ages we may face
the same source of bias as that for number of
sibs, which may exaggerate the results. A correlation for stature then automatically gives a
correlation for most anthropometric traits.

In my opinion great care has to be exercised
when interpreting data on assortative mating
especially those concerning demographic and
anthropometric traits. Pigmentation characters
(hair and eye-colour) are probably less biased,
but here also variations between social groups
ASSORTATIVE MATING IN MAN

are known (cf. Lundborg and Linders, 1926).2

Assortative Mating and Racial Prejudice
It is almost certain that there exists a conscious
or unconscious process of assortative mating
for pigmentation characters such as hair and
eye-colour even in such a homogeneous population as the Swedish one. It is reasonable to assume
that this process of sexual discrimination is more
effective in a highly heterogeneous population
such as a mixed negro-white community. It is
not possible, of course, to estimate what proportion of the race discrimination based on pigmentation traits depends on prejudice and on
unconscious assortative mating. All that can be
said is that even if we could eliminate all kinds of
race prejudice by education, there would
probably still exist a discrimination process
based on pigmentation traits. Such a process
would not per se mean anything undesirable
and would not cause any social tension as long
as the choice of marriage partner is dependent
only on the free will of the individuals involved,
without any interference of social pressures.
Gregor," discussing the nature of prejudice,
states that “‘Prejudice is the obverse image of
preferential association.” During the XIXth
International Congress of Sociology in Mexico
City in 1960 controversial opinions were
expressed during discussion of the causes of race
discrimination. In a review of these discussions
Gregor” stated that man shares with the social
animals a native disposition to preferred
association and that the racial differences act as a
focal point for group orientation. Some of the
members of this conference seemed to be in
favour of the theory of inborn racial attitudes
and some were against it. It is interesting to
note that, in recent discussions of assortative
mating, questions of race discrimination were
often involved. It seems as if there is a tendency
to “excuse” race discrimination by explaining
it as an exaggeration of the processes of assortative mating occurring within races and by stating

that the tendency to positive assortative mating
is an inborn phenomenon in humans. In a new
journal The Mankind Quarterly, which has been
developed to provide a forum for criticism
of the UNESco Statement on Race, such views
have often been expressed by different authors.
Without taking up any definite position in this
question, about which we know too little at
present, I should like to close this lecture with
the statement that studies of assortative mating
in man are certainly of much greater importance
for the understanding of the breeding patterns of
human populations than the actual interest of
scientists in these problems might indicate.
