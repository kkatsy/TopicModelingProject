that in a few years’ time the population will

deaths, our natural increase will become a

increase, as in the past ; it will mean adding
to our natural decrease. Who can doubt,
therefore, that very soon the subject of
external migration will begin to occupy a
far more important place in the public mind
than it does now?

The conditions during the years immediately preceding the war led to an enormous
flow of emigration to the Dominions.
During the decade 1902 to 1911, emigration
took away 34°6 per cent. of our natural
increase—which was much bigger then than
it is now, and meant 167,000 persons a
year.

During the war, and the difficult years of
repatriation, however, there was practically
no migration. At the end of the war, owing
to the conditions prevailing in the mother
country and the Dominions, in addition to
the greatly increased cost of passages,
spontaneous emigration did not begin again.
In 1920, the short period of artificial
prosperity came to an end and widespread
depression followed. It became apparent
that emigration would not be resumed on a
voluntary basis. At the same time, attention
was drawn to the sparsity of population in
those overseas portions of the Empire
inhabited by English-speaking people. It
was generally agreed that a better distribution of the white population of the Empire
was urgently desirable, and it seemed that
both the home country and the Dominions
would benefit if migration could be stimulated.

The problem resolved itself into two
parts. The first was to ensure that British
emigrants would get work on arriving in one

39
40 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

of the Dominions. The second was to arrange
that they and their families should be able
to reach that employment. It was with these
aims in view that the Empire Settlement
Act was passed in 1922. It enabled the
Government of this country to contribute
yearly up to £3,000,000 upon approved
schemes for the assistance of emigrants.
With slight modifications this Act is still in
force.

Before considering the operation of the
Act, we shall first refer to some of the figures
regarding migration to and from overseas
since the war (see Table I). First with regard
to immigration: the flow of British nationals
into the United Kingdom consists mainly of
officials of the Colonial and Indian services
returning on retirement; also of settlers
returning in order to retire. The age group
of immigrants is therefore substantially
higher than that of emigrants. Before the
world depression, this inward stream
remained very nearly constant, at about
55,000 persons a year. During the depression,
however, the stream increased—in 1932 it
reached as many as 76,000—being augmented
mainly by the return of recent emigrants
who had failed to establish themselves.
Since 1932 the inward stream has gradually
gone back to normal again.

Secondly, with regard to emigratic
the introduction of restrictions by
United States in 1921 helped to keep emig
tion from the United Kingdom in 1922 do
to 174,000. In 1923, which was the ff
year to benefit by the Empire Settlem:
Act, there was also a temporary tr
revival; emigration increased by nea
80,000. In 1924 there was an acute fall
155,000 mainly owing to further restricti
by the United States. During the five yea
1925-9, emigration from the United Kix
dom always exceeded 140,000, but quid
fell when the effects of the world depresg
were experienced. In 1931 emigration be

transferred with them. Further, even assuming that the necessary capital is available,
if the settlers are unable to find a market for
their produce, they cannot be successful.
Thus, unless the Dominions are receiving an
inflow of capital, in addition to being assured
of markets for their produce, they are not in
a position to accept immigrants on any
considerable scale.

What has happened to the two factors,
money and markets, since the war is well
known. Bad trade and high taxation have
made it difficult for the capitalist to set
aside money for investment abroad; consequently the flow of capital from the
United Kingdom to the Dominions has been
very limited. But probably the most important check which has dominated oversea
settlement since the war has been the unsatisfactory condition of trade which has
prevailed generally. All the Dominions have
had great difficulty in finding markets for
their produce. For this reason, New Zealand
was compelled in 1926 virtually to suspend
immigration. Much has been done to improve
trade between the United Kingdom and the
Dominions; but in spite of the slow improvement which occurred in our trade with
the Dominions up to 1927, the Dominions
never became sufficiently assured of markets
to be capable of receiving immigration on a
large scale.

Even so, between 1924 and 1936 as many
aS 1,164,000 emigrants left the United
Kingdom. What has been the effect of this
movement on our population? Emigrants
from this country have never consisted of
a random sample of the population. Our
population is by no means homogeneous ;
there are differentiating characteristics such
as age, sex, health, intelligence, enterprise
and so on. During last century these factors
were of little importance from the point of
view of emigration, because we then had a
growing (and perhaps surplus) population ;
also the cause of emigration then was almost
invariably some form of failure or discontent.

But the trend of our population has
changed since those days; so also has the
character of emigration. By the turn of the
century, emigration had been raised to a
42 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

better plane, and it has since become a
selective process. Factors such as the age,
sex and health of emigrants have begun to
assume special significance. But as emigration
in recent years has never reached as much
as I per cent. of our working population,
we must not exaggerate the practical importance of the effect of emigration upon
our national stock.

It is well known that all countries refuse
to admit persons sub-normal in health and
intelligence. The right of the Dominions to
choose their immigrants is seldom disputed ;
but we must not overlook the fact that the
Dominions have imposed standards requiring
an intellectual and physical capacity which
is probably above the average. Also, with
regard to enterprise: as all emigrants are
self-selected, emigration takes away the
ambitious rather than the lethargic.

As to the sex of emigrants: emigration
since the war has taken away more males
than females. In 1926, for example (a
typical year), the percentage of males among
emigrants from the United Kingdom was
53°7- Emigration therefore accentuates the
excess of females which already exists in our
population.

With regard to the age of emigrants:
emigration takes away the young rather
than the old. In a typical year, 1928 for
example, 85 per cent. of the males who
emigrated were under 30 years of age.
Emigration therefore has a damaging effect
on the age composition of our population.
Of our total male population in 1928, males
between the ages of 18 and 30 constituted
2I per cent.; but they composed as much
as 55 per cent. of the total male emigrants.
Thus, emigrants are drawn excessively from
persons approaching and reaching the age
when marriage is most usual, and who may
be considered as potential parents. Emigration therefore affects the trend and the
average quality of our population far more
seriously than by mere subtraction. From
the point of view of health, intelligence,
enterprise, sex and age, emigrants tend to
be drawn from those elements in our population which we need most.

EXTERNAL MIGRATION

When the population of Great Britain
begins to decline and the supply of native
labour decreases, there is the possibility that
the demand for labour may increase. In
these circumstances it appears most unlikely
that the United Kingdom Government will
begin to restrict Irish immigration. But, in
view of the unimpeded influx of Southern
Irish citizens into Great Britain, expenditure
by the United Kingdom Government in order
to transfer its own citizens to the Dominions
would already appear somewhat anomalous.

The chief difficulty with regard to Empire
Settlement since the war has been to supply
the Dominions with agriculturalists from the
population of the United Kingdom, which is
mainly urban. It is therefore ironical that
many of the Southern Irish citizens who have
recently entered Great Britain should have
come from the Irish countryside. Are not
some of these the very people the Dominions
are looking for ?

Up to the present, public interest in Irish
immigration into this country has centred
mainly on the economic consequences of the
movement; particularly in the Liverpool
and Glasgow areas. There are, however,
other aspects of importance. With regard to
the health of Irish immigrants: judging by
the heavy and arduous nature of the work
many of them take up, there is little doubt
that they physical capacity is above the
average. With regard to their age: from
what we know of Irish life, we infer that the
majority are young; their average age is
said to be about twenty. As to their sex:
in recent years, the influx has brought many
more women than men; between 1926 and
1936 Southern Irish immigrants entered
Great Britain in the ratio of three females
to two males. Also, with regard to their
fertility : Irish newcomers are likely to have
a somewhat larger family than our nativeborn population.

In view of both the trend and the general
quality of our population, these facts concerning Southern Irish immigrants are not
without significance. But the arrival of these
people is only the beginning of their story.
Between 1924 and 1935 nearly 40 per cent.
44

of the Irish influx was received by the
Liverpool region, and in that area the
Merseyside Survey showed that the percentage of Irish immigrants living in overcrowded conditions and the percentage
below the poverty line are both higher than
for the population as a whole: 12 to 10°8
for overcrowding, and 16:7 to 16 for
poverty. Also, although the mean number of
children born to Irish families is 4-3 compared with 3-9 for the population as a whole
more of them die ; when the number living is
considered, the advantage sinks to 3:2 to 3.

So far we have been concerned with the
movement of British citizens. Now we turn
to the movement of aliens to and from the
United Kingdom. The term “ alien ’”’ means
a person who is not a British subject. In
this connection it should be remembered,
however, that British nationals include
persons from all parts of the Empire; Irish
from Eire, negroes from Nigeria, Chinese
from Hong Kong, Indians and so on.

The landing of aliens is limited to certain
specified ports, and the immigration officers
stationed there have the power to prohibit
the landing of any undesirable alien. Most
of the aliens entering this country (such as
business men and tourists, and those who
come here on their way overseas) have no
intention of remaining for long; they
simply come and go.

Those aliens who arrive with a view to
taking up employment are only allowed to
land if they can produce permits which have
previously been issued to their employers by
the Ministry of Labour. The number of
permits granted has increased gradually
(apart from the depression years), up to
21,000 in 1937. As these permits only
enable foreigners to work here for six or
nine months, most of these aliens can hardly
be considered as true immigrants. But those
alien women who marry British become
British subjects.

It is paradoxical to find that, while we
strictly limit the number of incoming alien
workers and producers, we welcome those
foreigners who happen to be in a position
such that they and their dependants can

EXTERNAL MIGRATION 45

not refugees; if they wished, they could
return to their respective countries without
fear of discrimination on political, religious
or so-called racial grounds. But they
evidently prefer to live in this country
rather than in any other. Residence of at
least five years is always required before an
alien can be naturalized ; but any children
born to aliens in this country are, tfso facto,
British subjects.

With regard to the sex of alien immigrants :
the figures quoted show that while alien
men and women reside here in about equal
numbers, the sex proportion of different
nationalities varies considerably. As to their
age distribution : (and neglecting the refugee
children arriving in the last few months),
as the presence of young children always
tends to retard the movement of families, we
infer that the bulk of alien immigrants have
been adults, and that the age group in which
most of them occur is very probably an older
one than for our population as a whole.

It is evident that the alien section of our
population is being allowed to grow very
rapidly, and that alien immigration is now
bigger than it has ever been since the war.
But considered as a group it is surprising how
little we know about these people. The
official publication each year of many details
concerning alien immigrants as a group
(particularly the newcomers) seems to be
called for.

The recent influx of prolonged alien
visitors, together with the continued increase
(apart from the depression years) in the
number of alien workers coming with
permits, and the slight upward tendency in
naturalization since the war, all suggest a
distinct readiness on the part of aliens to
take advantage of the position. In view of
the decline which is to occur in our population, and the serious effect which any future
emigration to the Dominions will have on
