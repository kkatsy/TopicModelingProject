Urban and Rural Fertility

SOME FACTS

THE “FACTS” IN question are the index figures (live births per annum per thousand
women aged 10-49) quoted in the 1965 issue of the United Nations Demographic Yearbook. The figures are as follows; all of them relate to a recent period—within the last ten
years or so:

Urban Rural

Central African Republic 139 146
Dahomey 205 229
Guinea 166 205
South Africa: Asiatic 102 62

Coloured 140 221

White 84 96
Panama 113 153
USA 41 | 61
Israel 87 151
Japan 50 56
New Zealand 80 137
Austria 53 84
Bulgaria 54 71
Finland 58 66
Hungary 39 59
Norway 53 70
Roumania 40 56
Sweden 50 47
United Kingdom 65 65

Although drawn from a limited number of areas, these data amply illustrate the
thesis that urban fertility is lower than rural. It also seems reasonable that the difference
between town and country should be small in a developing country such as the Central
African Republic; larger in (say) Bulgaria, where fertility has recently fallen considerably
and where a temporary differential may have been set up because this change has taken
place earlier in the urban areas than in the rural ones; and that the disparity should again
be smaller in a country of advanced development such as Sweden.

Yet many questions remain unanswered by the figures. Why should the differential
be reversed in Sweden and among the Asiatic peoples of South Africa? Why should the
difference between town and country be so wide as one-half of the urban rate in the USA,
when it is so much smaller in Japan? And why should there be such a big disparity in the
results between Norway and Sweden?

To investigate these questions with precision would require a close study of the
demography of the countries in the table. A few general possibilities as to the factors

affecting the figures may however be mentioned, First, the chance that the data are unreliable must not be overlooked, especially in the developing countries. Secondly, the
definition of urban and rural may vary, and even if it does not it necessarily has a different
connotation according to a country’s economy and state of general development. Thus,
where most births take place in hospital, the siting of the hospitals of different qualities
will be highly significant, as also will be any tendency to choose urban hospitals in preference to rural ones. Finally, there are the demographic factors affecting the figures—
differences in the distribution of town and country populations by age and sex and
proportion married.

In spite of these important qualifications, the data have been included in the Yearbook.
They are certainly interesting and will no doubt serve as a stimulus to further research.
