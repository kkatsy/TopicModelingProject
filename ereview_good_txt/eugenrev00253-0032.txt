the War.

URING the occupation of France,
| «= customary annual publication

of current vital statistics (the
volumes entitled Statistique du Mouvement
de la Population) was abandoned. Instead,
statisticians turned their attention to historical demography and produced, under the
auspices of the Statistique Générale, a series
of admirable studies on the historical aspects
of fertility, mortality, naturalization and
migration.* Now, however, the French
Statistical Office is endeavouring to make
up for lost time, and the new volume of
Statistique du Mouvement de la Populationt
provides comprehensive data for the years
1939-42 inclusive. The object of this note is
to draw attention to some of the more
important points brought out by the new
statistics.

The general trend of replacement is shown
by the following table (Table I) of official
reproduction rates.{ From 1935 to 1939
these rates follow a course similar to that

shown by many other Western countries, a
general upswing which may have been connected with increases in employment. The
fall in 1940 and 1941 is comparable with,
that experienced in England and Wales, and
so is the rise in 1942, though the fall is
greater and the rise less in France. It will
be remembered that both the fall and the
rise in France after 1940 took place while
the male population was substantially depleted. In the 87 Departments, according to
the official estimate, the male population
fell by just over 2 millions between January
Ist, 1939, and December 31st, 1942, the
bulk of the fall occurring in the first half of
1940.* Thus, as Gasc pointed out (cf.
EUGENICS REVIEW, 1945, 37, p. 62), the fall
in fertility in 1941 was really less, and the rise
in 1942 greater, than the figures suggest.
It is officially estimated that about 800,000
married men were out of France in 1940,
and more than 600,000 in 1941. The following table shows the comparative legitimate
fertility rates (per 1,000 married women
aged 15-49 years) calculated on all married
women as well as on those married women

whose husbands were in France.* In general
(though not in detail), these rates confirm
the estimates made by Gasc. It is difficult,

however, to interpret these results, just as
it is difficult to estimate the full effect on
fertility in Britain of the movement overseas
of married men in the British armed forces.

A closer examination of the fertility
statistics is of considerable interest. Table
III summarizes the total age-specific fertility rates from 1935-7 to 1942,¢ and shows
the relatively high fertility of the older

fertility rates in Table IV, though the fall
as between 1930-32 and 1942 is greater. In
addition, the rate for the age group 20-24 years
appeared to be higher in 1942 than in 1930-32,
in spite of the general depletion of the
French male population. It is of interest,
even though the basis is not very certain,
to see the legitimate fertility rates as recalculated for married women whose husbands were in France,* for here, again, the
greater steadiness of the older groups is shown.

Perhaps the most interesting statistics
are those in Table VI, showing .the changes
in the distribution of births order among
legitimate births.t

ous Live Births

This appears to be confirmed by the statistics
of legitimate births by duration of marriage.
Of all legitimate births (including still births)
in 1939, 49:2 per cent were born to marriages
of under five years’ duration, whereas by
1941 the proportion had fallen to 43-0 per
cent.* Thus any improvement in or even
stabilization of circumstances might result
in a spurt of marriages, and perhaps an even
greater spurt of births. Marriage rates
began to rise in 1941 and births in 1942. The
provisional birth rate for 1943 was 15°9
per 1,000, as compared, with 14:3 for 1942.

some time. The proportion had been 66:3 per cent
in 1920-24, 53°9 per cent in 1925-30, and 52°5 per
cent in 1931-35. The first of these periods was, of
course, marked by the abnormal circumstances of
the immediate post-war years. In 1942 the proportion
rose to 44°8 per cent. In part, of course, the development is produced by changes in the absolute numbers
of marriages, of which there were only 169,971 in 1940
as compared with 247,358 in 1939. t P. 21.

2. The present position of French Population

Policy.

Although modern French population policy
began in the late nineteenth century, no
attempt was made to codify the various
branches of pro-natalist legislation until
the issue of the Code de la Famille, by a
decree-law of July 29th, 1939. In its 167
clauses, the new Code covered the whole
field, ranging from birth premiums and
family allowances, through, agricultural loans
and, income tax rebates, to the law against
abortion and the provision in all French
schools of instruction on population questions. The Code both extended the range of
pro-natalist legislation and raised above all
previous levels the monetary assistance given
by the positive measures. |

The various clauses could not all be
applied simultaneously and immediately.
In many cases special regulations. were
necessary before the measures could come
into force. But the general unfolding of the
Code proceeded without serious interruption
under the Vichy régime, which in any case
made the “ protection of the family” (including” the biological aspect) one of its
main tenets, and a similar continuity has
been shown by. the De Gaulle administration since the liberation of France.

The general task of implementing “ family
policy’ now belongs to the Ministry of
Health, which contains within itself a special
CURRENT NOTES

secretariat devoted to this function, the
Secrétariat Général a la Famille et a la
Population. In addition, stemming from
this central secretariat, are local officials in
all the regional prefectures, the Délégués
Régionaux a la Famille, whose mandate is
to assure the implementation of the “ family
policy ’’ at the regional level, and who serve
as links between the public authorities and
individual families and family associations.
The new organization thus apparently replaces, on a larger scale and at a more
effective level, the Haut Comité de la Population set up in February 1939 to consider
the overall question of population in France.
Part of the duty of the new central secre
tarlat is to survey population trends, and |

presumably the results of such surveying
will be taken into account in remodelling
existing measures or introducing new ones.
The present point is thus a convenient one
for seeing, before such potential changes
occur, how the main lines of policy have
developed under the Code de la Famille.
Since the most important clauses of the
original Code have already been summarized
elsewhere, the present notes will deal only
with those measures which have been
changed in any substantial way, or with
new measures.

A number of changes have been made in
the family allowance system, which continues to form the chief positive measure in
the pro-natalist hierarchy. First, the allowances are now paid to widows if they are
not themselves engaged in employment
which entitles them to allowances in their
own right. Secondly, the upper age limit for
children in respect of whom the allowances
are paid has been raised to 20 years, provided
that such children remain at their studies.

So far as the allowarices themselves_are
concerned, they continue to be paid as from
the second child, a national birth premium
being given instead for the first child if it
is born within two years after the marriage.
But the allowances have been increased.
Under the Code they were Io per cent of
the average wage (in the Département
concerned) for the second child, and 20
per cent for the third and each subsequent

ON DEMOGRAPHY 119
child. Now they are 10 per cent for the
second, 20 per cent for the third, and 30
per cent for the fourth and each subsequent
child.* At the same time the special allowance in respect of wives who did not take up
paid employment (for the mére au foyer) has
been largely given up, except for those
families not entitled to the salaive unique
allowance. The latter allowance, which is
now the more general one, is given (in respect
of a wide range of employees) to families in
which there is a single earner, as a supplement to the basic family allowance, and the
rates are also calculated on the average
wages of the Départements concerned. They
amount to Io per cent for a childless couple
during the first two years of married life ;}
20 per cent for an only child under five
years of age, and 10 per cent for one over
five years of age ; 20 per cent where there
are two or more children, but only one is
still dependent ; 25 per cent for two dependent children, and 30 per cent for three or
more.{ Combining the two forms of allowance, a wage-earner’s or employee’s family
with four dependent children would thus
receive grants amounting to go per cent of
the. average wage of the Département in
which they live, as compared with 60 per
cent under the original Code.

Within the general sphere of allowances
is the pécule (a lump sum grant), designed
to encourage families to return to rural life.
This appears to have replaced the agricultural loan which was criticized for its high
interest charges (4+ per cent) when the Code
was issued. The new grant consists of the
capitalization of half the amount of family

* In October 1944 these rates were raised temporarily (for six months) by 80 per cent for families
with two or three children, and by 50 per cent for
families with more than three children. Note also
that in addition to having separate average Départemental salaries calculated for urban and rural occupations, the urban rates may be increased by up to
15 per cent for families living in towns with over
200,000 inhabitants (including their immediate suburbs).
The latter measure does not appear to be a temporary
one.
t+ The allowance for a childless couple is temporary,
supposed to end with the issue of the decree setting
the official end of the war.

¢{ These rates have been increased temporarily by

allowances due on account of the dependent
children (including the salaive unique allowance), in the district in which the family
lived, from the date of application until the
time when the children entitled to the
allowances would have reached the age of
15 years. Once having received the grant,
the family allowances given in the new
district would amount to the other half of
the sum due, based on the rural rates and
excluding the allowance on account of a
salaire unique.

Income tax has now been made the subject
of further adjustment to family size. Under
the scheduled tax, for example, the head of
a family earning above 20,000 francs per
year net income, would be entitled to a 15
per cent reduction in the tax with one
dependent child, 30 per cent with two
children, 75 per cent with three, and 100
per cent with four, though the reduction
must not exceed 11,000 francs in the latter
case. Under the general income tax, a
bachelor would be liable to tax upon his
whole net income, while the head of a family
with four dependent children would be
granted a deduction of 59,000 francs from
his total income in arriving at his taxable
income. Property taxes are also subject to
rebates for families with dependent children.

Among other positive advantages are
further reductions in the cost of school and
university education. Another advantage,
which, may be especially helpful in war-time,
is the issue of a priority card to pregnant
women, to mothers breast-feeding their
children, to mothers having two or more
legitimate children under four years of age,
three under 14, or four under 16, or who have

received the médazlle de la famille frangatse..

The card gives the owners priority of attention in visiting the offices of public bodies,
including public utilities, in retail shops and
in markets.

The protection of pregnant women has
been extended, and all have the right to be
admitted free of charge to a hospital for
their confinement. Clause 98 of the Code
has also been implemented, in accordance
with which certain public maternity homes
have been designated in every Département.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

In case of poverty, pregnant women have
the right to be admitted to them at any
stage of pregnancy, and, if they so desire,
may claim secrecy concerning their pregnancy and confinement. The latter provision
is probably aimed especially at reducing the
incentive to abortion. For the same purpose
the law against abortion has again been
made more severe. The woman herself is
liable to the same penalties whether pregnant or not, is denied the benefit of a suspended sentence, and, if convicted, is
prohibited from taking employment in any
maternity home. Those who procure or
try to procure an abortion for a woman
may, even if not convicted, be prohibited
from residing in a specific area or compelled
to reside in another. Moreover, they are
treated as enemies of the state and, as such,
may be brought before the Tribunal a’ Etat
and sentenced to death, penal servitude for
life, deportation or imprisonment, any term
of imprisonment to be not less than that
prescribed by the Code de la Famille.

This summary of developments since the
promulgation of the Code suggests that,
although there have been many individual
changes, the basic structure of the legislation remains the same. There is still
pressure from thé various pro-natalist associations for further reform. For example,
the Alliance Nationale urges an increase in
family allowances to the point at which
they amount to 30 per cent of the average
Départemental salary for each dependent
child, the establishment of allowances during
pregnancy, the extension of the allowance
for salatre unique to employers and workers
on own account, and the generalization of
birth premiums to apply to all births,
provided that the interval between each is
not more than three years. In the general
field of morality they press for the family
vote, for a change in the divorce law to
prevent, the guilty partner marrying the
co-respondent, and for a more effective law
against abortion. But even these extensive
demands foreshadow no change in the bases
of policy, which comprise increasingly substantial monetary grants in respect of
children on the one hand, and, on the other,
CORRENT NOTES ON DEMOGRAPHY

increasingly severe attacks on abortion, as
well as the maintenance of the legislation
prohibiting the dissemination of birth control
information.* On wide ranges of social
questions, especially on housing, relatively
little progress appears to have been made,
and the socio-psychological factors have
been left largely untouched, save for private
propaganda. French policy thus still refuses
to acknowledge voluntary parenthood as a
basis, though its practice is evident, and at
the same time is narrower (though not
necessarily less substantial) than Sweden in
the general scope of its positive measures.

3. The Future of French Population Policy.

In connection with the previous discussion,
a new study by Professor A. Sauvy is of
great interest. Professor Sauvy, well known
as an economist specializing in trade-cycle
problems, and also for his estimates of the
future population of France, was a member
of the Haut Comité de la Population, He is
now associated with the Secrétartat Général
a la Famille and his views on policy are thus
particularly relevant to any consideration
of future development in France. His recent
publications have in the main been concerned with population questions—La Population, Ses Lots, Ses Equilibres (Presses
Universitaires de France, Paris, 1944), primarily an introduction to demographic
analysis; Richesse et Population (Payot,
Paris, 1943,-2nd edn., 1944), an extensive
analysis of economic aspects of population
change; and now Bien-Eire et Population
(Edition Sociale Francaise, Paris, 1945), which
attempts to put the population question and

* No further developments in the law relating to
birth control propaganda appear to be indicated,
though the Alliance Naitonale argues that present
legislation does not really cover the sale of contr:
ceptives unless this is associated with or for the purpose
of propaganda.

f{-These notes are based primarily on the Journal
Officiel, July 30th, 1939, pp. 9607-9626 ; the Petit Guide
des Familles, Paris, 1945 ; and various recent publications of the Alliance Nationale contre la Dépopulation,
namely: Avantages réservés aux Familles Frangaises,
Paris, January, 1944; Vitalité (N.D., but apparently
1944) ; Comment Reconquériv le Frangats a l'Idée Familiale. (N.D., but apparently 1944); and Aliance
Nationale : Son Historique, Les Réalisations qu'elle a
Obtenues, son Programme d’Aveniy (N.D., but apparently 1944).

its solution simply and fairly before the public.

The background to Professor Sauvy’s
policy proposals is his view that France is
underpopulated at present, apart from any
further underpopulation which would result
from the continuance of pre-war trends of
fertility and mortality. He believes that the
object of French policy should be a population
of between 50 and 75 millions. The lower
figure should be regarded only as the shortrun objective for, according to Sauvy, it
would still leave France below the optimum
level. To achieve the lower figure would
require, even with a net reproduction rate
of 1-2, about two generations, unless assisted.
by immigration. Nevertheless, Sauvy chooses
the higher figure, and aims at an annual rate
of growth of between 300,000 and 350,000
persons, and a consequent slow progress to
the objective. |

The proposed rate of growth is allocated
between mortality, immigration and fertility. On mortality Sauvy assumes that
where the age-specific death rates are higher
in France than in England, they should be
brought down to the English level; and
where they are already on a par with, or
lower than, those of England and Wales,
they should be forced down by a further
20 per cent. This would reduce deaths by
about 64,000 (on a 1938 basis), of which
about 30,000 would directly help to raise
the net reproduction rate (that is, primarily
deaths below 30 years of age). As regards
immigration, Sauvy doubts the wisdom of
having in any given year foreigners amounting to more than about 10 per cent of the
total population. Assuming that assimilation takes about a generation to achieve, he
estimates that about 120,000 to 150,000 per
year might be taken as the practicable
maximum (average over a_ generation).
That would leave about 150,000 births per
year to be found, additional to the number
of births in 1938.

Immigrants, Professor Sauvy believes,
should be drawn as far as possible from
Belgium and Holland (since the Northern
countries can scarcely be counted on), with
Spain, Italy and Poland as the next preferences, in the order stated. They should
122

include such manual workers as masons,
miners and agricultural labourers, but also
skilled and professional workers.* Every
effort should be made to speed up assimilation, but, at the same time, definitive
naturalization should in the majority of
cases be replaced by an intermediate stage,
giving limited rights and easily revoked if
necessary.

There would be no difficulty in reducing
mortality. The means of doing so are known,
and it is primarily the money that is lacking.
Special emphasis is, however, laid upon
housing and decentralization as well as upon
reducing the consumption of alcoholic drinks.

To raise fertility, Professor Sauvy proposes an attack on the broadest front. On
the negative side, he visualizes new, stringent measures against abortion, supported
by the positive inducements of allowances
during pregnancy, free medical advice and
attention during and after pregnancy, and
the opportunity for unmarried mothers of
having their confinement in conditions of
medical secrecy.t On the more general,
positive side, he would begin by offering
marriage loans, on the German model, with
the object of lowering the average age at
marriage, believing that a permanent move

in this direction would result in higher.

marital fertility.{ For a first-born child
there should be a grant to cover the costs
of clothing, and for every child there should
be a substantial “‘ family allowance.” This
latter should be supplemented by a “ hous
* During the inter-war period there was some
criticism of French immigration policy on the grounds
that it resulted in using foreigners for the heaviest
and least well-paid work, while unreasonably promoting Frenchmen to middle-class status.

+ He is not quite consistent on the subject of birth
control. In Bien-Etve et Population, p. 204, he argues
that, should fertility become too high, it would be
better to encourage birth control than to tolerate
abortion, though he doubts if the need is likely to
arise. But in Richesse et Population, p. 315, he writes
‘“‘ Birth restriction being necessary in some degree,
it would not only be illusory but also dangerous to
attempt to get rid of it entirely.”” He also suggests
in the latter book (p. 316) that in the interests of
quality it would be desirable to make use of sterilization for limited and strictly defined cases.

t~ This would only be so, other things being equal.
But if contraception is practised, there is no reason
why earlier marriage as such should significantly
increase total marital fertility.

ing allowance,” to be raised primarily by
increasing rents in general and using the
increase to provide proper accommodation
for families with more than two children.*
Children should entitle their parents to
substantial rebates in income tax, fares and
charges for gas and electricity, and large
families should be especially favoured, for
example, in awarding scholarships, in the
allocation of employment, and in reducing
the term of conscription. Sterility and
celibacy should not be penalized as such,
but the celibates and childless should bear
a larger part of the financial burden of the
nation. Married women should not be
prohibited from continuing im part employment. But a special allowance (e.g., the
salaive unique allowance) should be given
to enable them to stay at home without
sacrificing their standard of living and provision should be made for part-time employment which would not interfere with their
household responsibilities. |
In the general economic sphere, every
effort should be made to increase employment and production, and apparent overproduction should be attacked by increasing
consumption.t At the same time, old people
should be encouraged to work and earn in
addition to receiving their pensions.
Knowledge of the facts of population
should be spread widely. Propaganda should
stop picturing procreation as a duty and the
family as an end in itself, and should,
instead, demonstrate that everyone will
benefit if the population is maintained. The
goal should be normal families of three or
four children, not prodigies of eight or ten.
Finally, there should be universal suffrage
in the full sense—a vote for everybody,
including children. A child’s vote would be
exercised by his mother while he was less
than ten years old, and by his father during
the rest of his minority. This, Sauvy argues,
* He claims (Richesse et Population, p. 303) that rent
in France has been unduly controlled, forming only
about 4 per cent of working-class budgets. But he
insists that any increase in rent should go to the
State, not to the property owners.
t+ On the other hand, Sauvy is opposed to “ excessively. rapid’ technical progress and would be

prepared to levy a small tax;in certain cases, on firms
making innovations in their methods of production.

would: ensure the full representation of
children’s. and family interests.

The above summary scarcely does justice
to Professor Sauvy’s plan to ensure that,
as he defines it, children shall be “ public
friend number one.”” Many of his proposals
are much more subtle than has been indicated. Though the plan suffers from some
inconsistencies, and the basic figures used
in defining the objectives are very approximate, yet as a whole the programme is
more comprehensive and realistic than
even the latest proposals of the Allance
Nationale, while at the same time it is free

from the dogmatism which sometimes mars
the publications of that organization. Nevertheless, it is very much in the general tradition of French population policy. In spite
of the goal of families of four or five children,
there is still no explicit acceptance of
voluntary parenthood. Thus the analysis
of Professor Sauvy’s proposals confirms and
amplifies the conclusions of the previous
section. There are indications of a substantial future increase in the amount of French
policy, but it does not seem very probable
that its general guality will be affected in
any significant way. |

To the Edttor, Eugenics Review

S1r,—I do not think Mr. Dunlop has been quite
fair in his short criticism (April issue) of my letter
on the above subject (January issue). I have never
suggested that ‘‘ undeveloped territories should be
given to those powerful nations which have a high
birth rate and are also aggressive.”’ I suggested
that restrictions on immigration to such territories should be removed in the case of vigorous
peoples of the same primary race as those already
settled. Furthermore I did not say that wars
would thus infallibly be prevented, but that, if

nothing were done to provide room for the expansion of vigorous peoples with high birth rates,
further wars of aggression or conquest must come
sooner or later, simply because no other solution
to their difficulties is possible (except perhaps
birth control which they will not adopt). This
proved to be true in 1914 and in 1939, and as long
as the root cause of these wars is not removed, it
will prove true again, however little we may like
certain ‘‘ vigorous peoples.”’
