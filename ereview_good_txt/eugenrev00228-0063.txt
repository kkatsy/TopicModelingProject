Mortality in
Under-Developed Countries
SOME FACTS

some particulars were given of death rates at

various ages in Great Britain and other industrially developed countries. It is now the
intention to show some demographic material of
the same kind for less well developed areas.

Although much ingenious work has been done
in recent years in expressing mortality in terms of
single parameters such as crude death rates, adjusted death rates, infantile mortality rates and
the like, these necessarily remain rather weak
substitutes for rates of mortality computed in
the traditional way at individual ages. Such rates
are not often available for the under-developed
areas, but some figures taken from the United
Nations Demographic Year Book for 1951 and
that for 1957, which gave special attention to the
subject of mortality, are set out in Table 1. The
particulars shown are too scattered in space and
time to constitute a representative selection;
moreover, they vary in comparability and probably also in reliability; but in contrast with the
figures for England and Wales given at the foot
they provide a general idea of the gap that
remains to be closed between the more and the
less developed areas of the world.

Some “expectations of life’? are shown ig
Table 2 in order to illustrate the implications o§
the differences in mortality in Table 1. It will t
noted that while the countries for which dag
were set out in Table 1 reappear, with additiong
in Table 2 the dates for which the expectation
are available do not correspond very closely witl
the dates of the rates. A broad picture is, how
ever, painted of the disparities in terms of humag
length of life between different parts of th
world. a
A striking feature of the tables is the reductiogg
in mortality and increase in longevity shown i§
those cases where particulars for two
periods can be given, even though the differen
in time is no more than ten years.

The similarity in Table 1 of the rates fq
Taiwan in 1956 and those for Jamaica in 19§
(except at age 0) suggests that the expectations
life for Taiwan in 1956 would be of the s
order in size as those for Jamaica in 1950- ;
shown in Table 2. The development over tj
decade or more since the period 1936-41 wou
thus be as striking as that in Mauritius. 4
