CURRENT NOTES ON POPULATION TRENDS

By D. V. GLASS 
AUSTRALIA
Australian Birth-rate Inquiry
Ae leat Ce which had one of the

earliest Commissions to inquire into

the decline of the birth-rate (the New
South Wales Commission, 1903), is now
conducting another official investigation into
the same subject. This time the inquiry is
intended to be nation-wide and is being
undertaken not by an ad hoc body appointed
for the purpose, but by the National Health
and Medical Research Council. An interim
report, issued at the end of last year,* gives
some indication of the scope and method of
the investigation.

The report consists of a general statement
summarizing, and drawing inferences from,
a number of special inquiries, the results of
which are published as appendices. The
special inquiries include a demographic and
economic analysis of population trends,f an
interim report on a study of certain medical
aspects of the fall in the birth-rate,f a
summary of the contents of 1,400 letters
freely written to the Council by women
limiting the size of their families and explaining why they are doing so, and a study
of the requirements of mothers and children.§

The general report—and, presumably,
many of the special studies—are at an interim
stage and it is perhaps only fair to reserve
judgment on the value of the material until
the final report is published. Nevertheless,

even at this stage, some of the results are
somewhat disappointing. The study presented by Coombs, Wilson and Carver, for
example, gives a brief and useful analysis
of the decline in fertility in Australia since
1881. It includes a comprehensive series of
reproduction rates from that date to 1943.
It also provides a new series of estimates
of the future population of Australia. Yet
the demographic analysis is very limited,
especially in relation to the comprehensive
nature of Australian census and vital
statistics. Thus, in projecting the future
course of fertility in Australia, it is important
to isolate the factors producing the upward
trend in fertility since 1934, in order to
estimate whether or not these factors are
likely to persist after the war. This would
involve an analysis of changes in marriage
frequency and their effects upon the proportions of married women with various
marriage durations, and a detailed study of
the development of marital fertility by age
of mother and duration of marriage. Further,
any thorough consideration of probable
future trends necessitates an examination
of changes in family size and distribution.
For example, knowledge of trends in the
proportions of childless married women of
different ages and for various marriage
durations is of great importance in prognosis,
as well as for the implementation of a practical population policy. It is to be hoped
that any final report will take these questions
into account.

It is difficult to know what value to attach
to the letters summarized by J. H. L.
Cumpson,* in which individual women explain why they are limiting the size of their
families. The invitation issued to the women
stated that “‘we are now dealing with a

Reasons for Limiting their families.’’.
66 | THE EUGENICS REVIEW

problem in which the national habit of
leaving it to the Government has no place,
and we want the truth—truth which only
the women themselves can tell us.””’ Apart
from the technical question of whether the
voluntary respondents constitute a representative sample of those married women
who practise family limitation, there is the
fundamental question of whether any inquiry
on these lines is likely to yield results of
much practical value. No doubt the women
have told the truth as they see it, but
analysis of one’s own motives is far from
being a straightforward pursuit.
are coloured by the society in which we live,
by the rationalizations and catchwords
current in our particular epoch. Even at
best, letters of this kind can do no more
than present, in the form of striking personal
rvapportage, the views common to a given
time and place. If guidance is wanted in
the construction of a practical policy, far
more valuable material would be obtained
by analyzing, for a relatively small sample
of women, the difficulties and problems
encountered when children are being born
and brought up, and then ascertaining how
far and in what ways it is possible to overcome such difficulties.

Yet the general report is important in
showing what changes have taken place in
opinion in the last forty years. The New
South Wales Commission analyzed the
decline in fertility largely in terms of personal selfishness. The present inquiry at
least implicitly recognizes the validity of
individual decisions in limiting family size
when it. urges, among its major interim
recommendations, better homes, relief and
help for mothers in the home, improved
maternity services, and economic security.
It will be of great interest to see what
specific proposals are made to meet these
recommendations.

The Future Population of Australia

The summary of estimates of future
population published in the EuGEnics REVIEW in 1944 (35, 71-84) gave one estimate
for Australia—that by Wolstenholme, which
originally appeared in 1936. Two further

Motives 
estimates have since been published, and it
is worth summarizing their assumptions and
results.

The first* assumes a continuance of the
mortality of 1940 and a fertility slightly
above that of 1936-40, resulting in a gross
reproduction rate of I-095 and a net reproduction rate of almost 1-0 for 1950 and
subsequent years. Migration is not taken
into account. The results are given by
five-year age groups at five-year intervals
for females and by totals at ten-year intervals
for males, from 1940 to 19g90.

In the secondt there are three sets of
hypotheses. They are not fully stated, but
in general terms they all assume “a slow
fall in rates of mortality,” and allow for
‘the war-time rise in births and a probably
high level in the years immediately following
the War.’ Migration is not taken into
account. In addition, Estimate A assumes
the maintenance of a net reproduction rate
of 0-925 after 1950; Estimate B assumes
the same trend up to 1950, but thereafter a
decline of the net reproduction rate to
0-889 in 1960, 0°854 in 1970, 0-819 in 1980
and 0-781 in 1990 ; while Estimate C assumes
a rise in the net reproduction rate to I-o
by 1970 and to 1-1 by 1995.

The results are given for total populations
only. For Estimates A and B they are
stated for five-year time intervals from 1940
to 1980 and thereafter by ten-year intervals
to 2000. For Estimate C the results are
stated only for 1950, 1960 and 2000.

The results of both sets of estimates are
summarized in Table I.

The new estimates have been conditioned,
to some extent, by the upward rise in
fertility since 1934, and are therefore more
“ optimistic ’’ than those produced by Wolstenholme. It is instructive to compare
them with the population objective announced by Mr. E. M. Forde, Deputy Prime
Minister of Australia, as reported in The
Times of April 3rd, 1945. Mr. Forde said

that ‘“‘ Australia had plans up to the blueprint stage for the absorption of a steady
flow of suitable emigrants. They aimed at
trebling the present population of 7,300,000
in the shortest possible time.’’ This objective
would certainly involve far more immigration
than Australia has been contemplating
hitherto. And even immigration at a substantially lower level would raise the question
of the bases of past Australian migration
policy, as well as that of the sources of
future migrants.

BRITISH EMPIRE

Reproduction Rates for the British Empire

Table II summarizes the available reproduction rates for Britain, Eire and the
Dominions from 1935 onwards. It is hoped,
in subsequent issues of the REVIEw, to fill
the gaps in this table and to provide more
up-to-date rates as the basic data necessary
for their calculation become available. Rates
for other countries will also be published.

At present it is not possible to interpret
the trend of the rates in any comprehensive
way. Obviously they represent a significant
upward movement in fertility since the mid‘thirties. But, equally obviously, it is necessary to make a detailed analysis of the way in
which the change has occurred before deciding
what it means. The questions raised by the
striking rise of the Effective Reproduction
Rate for England and Wales to 0-99 in 1944
—the highest rate recorded since 1922—are
equally relevant for all the other countries
which have shown a comparable trend, and

call for further study of the basic statistics.*
Subsequent issues of the REVIEW will, it is
hoped, present more detailed studies for
individual countries.

THE MAORI POPULATION

The Fertility of the Maoris

The 1936 census of New Zealand} enumerated 82,326 persons classified as Maoris.
These included full-bloods, three-quarter,
half and other Maori-European crosses above
the quarter-caste level. The figure did not
represent the entire population of Maori
origin. Apart from the unrecorded elements
containing some slight strain of Maori blood,
there were a further 11,830 persons, including
quarter-caste crosses with Europeans and
crosses between Maoris and non-European
stocks. These latter 11,830 persons are
included in the European population of New

Zealand, and as the vital statistics are, as

far as possible, classified on the same basis,
this section of the Maoris must be omitted
in dealing with Maori fertility.

Taking only the former group as constituting Maoris proper for the purpose of analysis,
the census summary indicates that growth
in their numbers was not really significant
or consistent before 1901, at which time
they appeared to amount to 45,549 persons.
However, as even the 1gor and immediately
subsequent censuses were probably liable
to significant errors, it is doubtful if fully
reliable conclusions can be drawn from
them: At the 1926 census a special Maori
schedule was used for the North Island and
the Chatham Islands, the main location. of
the Maoris, and the enumeration was taken for a specific night. The 1936 census was
taken on the same lines and showed a growth
over the decade of 18,656 persons, or 29°3
per cent. It also showed an extremely
young population, having a mean age of
21-97 years as compared with 31:69 years
for Europeans. As regards the validity of
the 1936 results, the official view is that
“Changed circumstances and _ different
methods in the most recent censuses have

NOTES ON TABLE ITI

_ Unless otherwise stated, the N.R.R.s are calculated on the basis of life-tables constructed for the years
corresponding with the G.R.R.s.

England and Wales.—The rates are approximate before 1939. From 1938 to 1940 they are computed from
the age-specific fertility rates published by the Registrar-General, and for 1941 onwards on the basis of
unpublished data supplied by the Registrar-General. Throughout, life-tables have been computed on the
basis of the deaths given in relevant issues of the Statistical Review. Rates for 1939 and later years are based
on births occurring in each calendar year. For earlier years they are based on births registered in each
calendar year. The “ E.R.R.” (Effective Reproduction Rate), published by the Registrar-General in the Quarterly
Return, involves the extrapolation of mortality rates. The E.R.R. is always higher than the N.R.R. and the
difference is greatest for years of high actual mortality. |

Scotland.—The rates, which are approximate before 1939, are based upon the statistics given in the relevant
issues of the annual Review, and upon unpublished statistics supplied by the Registrar-General.

Irish Free State-—The rates are approximate. For 1935-7, see Glass, Population Movements and Policies, Oxford,
1940, p. 419. The rates for 1940-2 are based on the births reported in the Annual Report of the Registray-General
(Eire) for 1943 and the female population and life-table (1940-2) given in the Statistical Abstract (Eire) for 1944,
PP. 23-4.

Canada.—The rates for Canada, corrected for under-registration of births, are from a Bulletin issued by the
roooea Cl Dy of Statistics (Ottawa), entitled Gross and Net Reproduction Rates, Canada and Provinces,
r920-42 (N.D

South A frica.—For 1936, see Glass, South African Journal of Economics, March 1939, p. 45. For subsequent
years the G.R.R.s are from the Statistical Year-Book of the League of Nations, 1941-2, while the mortality data in
that publication have been used for constructing life-tables for each year.

Australia.—The rates are from Coombs, Wilson and Carver, in Report of the National Health and Medical
Research Council (Commonwealth of Australia), 18th Session, 1944, p. 19

New Zealand.—For 1935-6, see Glass, EuGENIcs REview, 85, Nos. 3 and 4, Pp. 83. For 1937-41, the rates
are based on the births and deaths given in the relevant Annual Report on the Vital Statistics of New Zealand, and
from estimated populations given in the relevant Statistical Report on Population and Buildings. The latter reports
also contain reproduction rates (including the G.R.R. for 1942 given in the above table), but they are based on a
life-table for 1934-8, while the present N.R.R.s use life-tables for each year. Rates for New ‘caland are slightly
too high, since the births almost certainly include some attributable to the Maoris.
a CURRENT NOTES ON POPULATION TRENDS IN THE BRITISH EMPIRE 69

computed was about 3:36 and the net rate
about 2-24. For 1940-2 the gross reproduction rate was about 3-5. These rates
are extremely high. The only comparable
recorded gross reproduction rates for Europeans (apart from seventeenth century French
Canada) are those for European Russia and
for the Ukraine in 1896-7, namely 3-44 and
3°65 respectively. So far as mortality is
concerned, an abridged female life-table
constructed on the basis of the unadjusted
data for 1935-7 shows a situation comparable
with Bulgaria in 1900-5.

.However, in interpreting the above rates,
it must be remembered that there is underregistration of Maori births and deaths.
Taking the period 1926-36, for which the
census data are probably the most reliable,
the recorded excess of births over deaths
was 12,566. But, even allowing for net
immigration in the period (only 69, according
to the 1936 census), the intercensal increase
was almost 18,600.* What apparently
happens, according to the Census Department, is not that Maori births and deaths
fail entirely to be registered, but that they
are in part registered amon gthe European
vital statistics. The New Zealand Officral
Year Book for 1944 states (p. 41): “‘ For
population purposes, half-castes and persons
between half and full blood rank as Maoris ;
but it is not always possible to ensure that
this practice is followed in the registration
of births (and of deaths).’’+

The published vital statistics of the
Maoris are not given in sufficient detail to
make it possible to estimate the respective
deficiencies of birth and death registration.
But the fact that, on the basis of the 23,702
recorded births and 11,136 recorded deaths
in the period 1926-36, the calculated population growth was too low by about 6,000
persons, indicates a very substantial deficiency in birth registration, and suggests

* Vol. III, Maori Census, Wellington, 1940, p. iii.

¢ The 1936 census Report states that, for the New
Zealand population as a whole (including Maoris), the
growth of population “ between the censuses of 1926
and 1936 was almost exactly equal to the total recorded
excess of births over deaths plus the excess recorded
for persons arriving from overseas over those departing
overseas.”

that the gross reproduction rate in 1935-7
might, in reality, be significantly higher than
that estimated on the basis of the registered
births.

On the other hand, it is likely that Maori
registration has improved since 1926, and
that, therefore, the bulk of the deficiency
should be attributed to the earlier part of
the intercensal period. This view is supported by an examination of the available
statistics. Using uncorrected births, the
gross reproduction rate for 1925-7 is about
2:0. Yet a scrutiny of the census data
for 1926 and 1936 indicates that the ratio
of children under 5 to women aged 15 to
49 years was substantially the same for
both years, being only about 6 per cent
higher in the latter year. This suggests that
registration was markedly more deficient in
1926, and that, in fact, fertility in 1925-7.
was about as high as in 1935-7.*

In considering the validity of these vital
rates, it should be remembered that the complexities involved in the process of recording
necessarily make the analysis difficult. For
example, a half-caste Maori woman, married
to a European, would be classified at the
census as a Maori, but when she bears a
child it should presumably be registered as
European. Conversely, a European woman,
married to a pure-bred Maori, would be
classified as European at the census, but
her children should presumably be registered
as Maori. Thus, even with accurate and
comprehensive census and vital statistics
the calculation of fertility rates for Maoris
would involve a number of problems. The
situation is further complicated by the fact
that neither census nor vital statistics concern themselves with these aspects of the
question. The census enumerates Maori
following facts. In 1925, registered female births
amounted to only 800, whereas girls under 1 enumerated
at the census on April 2oth, 1926, amounted to 1,013.
For 1935-6 the figures were 1,492 female births and
1,369 girls under 1 year of age. (Defective enumeration
of this particular age group would not affect this inference, unless—as seems most unlikely—the deficiency
were greater in 1936 than in 1926.) Approximate
G.R.R.s based on children aged o-4 years (instead of
births) suggest a fertility higher by only about 2 per

cent in 1936 than in 1926—in other words not significantly different.
70

women and men but does not state the stock
of their husbands or wives. Marriage
statistics, as published in the various issues
of the Annual Report of Vital Statistics, do
not show intermarriage, and birth statistics
do not show the stock of the parents.* In
the absence of such information, the fertility
rates given in the present note have been
computed simply by relating Maori births,
as registered, to the Maori female population,
as enumerated. If, in race crossing, the main
tendency is for half-caste Maori women to
marry European men (bearing children who
should presumably be registered as European), then the fertility rates of Maori
women would be still higher than the
statistics indicate. On the other hand, if the
tendency is mainly for European women to
marry pure-bred Maori men, then the rates
are exaggerated as an index of the fertility
of Maori women. Taking into account, however, the probability of defective birth
registration of Maoris—even if of a much
lower order in 1936 than in 1926—the fertility rates given are less likely to overstate
than to understate the real situation, and
there is no doubt that Maori fertility is very
high.

How long this high fertility has obtained
is very difficult to tell. The rg92r census

* What, of course, we really need to know (assuming
that full registration of Maori births were attained) is
the precise female population to which to relate the
births registered as Maori, and also the precise numbers

of births which should be related to the female population enumerated as Maori at the census.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

report stated that “‘ whatever the imperfections of the medium of collection, the
cardinal fact emerges that the Maori race
retains its virility and is on the increase.’’*
But this conclusion, derived exclusively
from census data, gives only a general picture. It cannot be made more precise by
reference to vital statistics, for Maori registration is of recent date (it came into force
as from March Ist, 1913) and its deficiencies
in the early period cannot be checked
because they were paralleled by defective
census enumeration.

It should be noted that high fertility has
been accompanied by an increase in the
merging of the Maoris with other stocks.
Of the 94,156 persons of Maori blood
enumerated in 1936 (including the 11,830
persons counted in the European population),
55,915, Or 59°4 per cent, were classed as
full-blood. In 1926 the comparable figures
were 45,429 out of a total of 69,780, or
65-1 per cent. The 1936 Census Report
cites evidence suggesting that these propor
tions are over-stated and that, for 1936,

the true percentage would be nearer 45-50
per cent. The general view of the Report
is summed up thus: “‘ The census records.
suggest that the extent of miscegenation is
increasing at a fairly rapid rate. It seems
clear that in a few generations the European
and Maori divisions of the population will
have blended to a very large degree.’’f
