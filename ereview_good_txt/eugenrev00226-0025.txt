A Proposed Standard System of
Nomenclature of Human Mitotic
Chromosomes

The statement which follows was drawn up by a study group which met together to formulate an
agreed system of nomenclature for human chromosomes with a view to eliminating the confusion
which has arisen from the independent publication of a variety of systems by different workers.
Its signatories hope that, by its publication in a number of journals in different countries, it will
be of real service to human genetics in general and to the study of human cytology in particular.

HE RAPID GROWTH of knowledge of

human chromosomes in several labora
tories, following advances in technical
methods, has given rise to several systems by
which the chromosomes are named. This has
led to confusion in the literature and so to the
need for resolving the differences. Consequently,
at the suggestion of Dr. C. E. Ford, a small study
group was convened to attempt the formulation
of a common system of nomenclature. The
meeting was arranged, through the good offices
of Dr. T. T. Puck, to be held at Denver, in the
University of Colorado, under the auspices of
the Medical School. The meeting of this study
group was made possible by the support of the
American Cancer Society, to whom grateful
thanks are due. For practical reasons, it was
decided to keep the group as small as possible
and to limit it to those human cytologists who
had already published karyotypes.* In addition,

’*In contemporary publications the terms, karyotype
and idiogram, have often been used indiscriminately.
We would recommend that the term, karyotype, should be
applied to a systematized array of the chromosomes of a
single cell prepared either by drawing or by photography,
with the extension in meaning that the chromosomes of a

three councillors were invited to join the group
to guide and aid the discussions and, if necessary,
to arbitrate. Fortunately, this last office did
not prove necessary, and it was possible by
mutual agreement to arrive at a common system
which has flexibility.

It was agreed that the principles to be observed
by the system should be simplicity and freedom,
as far as possible, from ambiguity and risks of
confusion, especially with other systems of
nomenclature in human genetics. It should also
be capable of adjustment and expansion to meet
the needs of new knowledge of human chromosomes. The system should be agreed to by the
greatest possible proportion of cytologists working in the field, but the risk that a minority may
be unable to accept the system as a whole should
not be allowed to delay adoption by a majority.

It was agreed that the autosomes should be
serially numbered, 1 to 22, as nearly as possible

single cell can typify the chromosomes of an individual
or even a species. The term, idiogram, would then be
reserved for the diagrammatic representation of a
karyotype, which may be based on measurements of the
chromosomes in several or many cells.

TABLE 1
CONSPECTUS OF HUMAN MITOTIC CHROMOSOMES

Group 1-3 Large chromosomes with approximately
median centromeres. The three chromosomes are readily distinguished from each

other by size and centromere position.

Group 4-5 Large chromosomes with submedian
centromeres. The two chromosomes are
difficult to distinguish, but chromosome

4 is slightly longer.

Medium sized chromosomes with submedian centromeres. The X chromosome
resembles the longer chromosomes in this
group, especially chromosome 6, from
which it is difficult to distinguish. This
large group is the one which presents
major difficulty in identification of individual chromosomes.

Group 6-12

in descending order of length, consistent with
operational conveniences of identification by
other criteria. The sex chromosomes should
continue to be referred to as X and Y, rather
than by a number, which would be an additional
and ultimately, a superfluous appellation.

It was generally agreed that the 22 autosomes
can be classified into seven groups, distinction
between which can readily be made. Within
these groups, further identification of individual
chromosomes can in many cases be made
relatively easily. Within some groups, especially
the group of chromosomes numbered 6-12,
including also the X chromosome, the distinctions between the chromosomes are very
difficult to make by criteria at present available.
However, lesser difficulties are encountered in
separating chromosomes 6 and the X from the
remainder of this group. It is believed that, with
very favourable preparations, distinction can be
made between most, if not all, chromosomes.

It is proposed that the autosomes first be
ordered by placing the seven groups as nearly
as possible in descending order of size. Within
each group the chromosomes are arranged, for
the most part, by size. It was desired specifically
to avoid the implication that size relationships
have been permanently decided in every instance,
but it is hoped that the assignment of numbers
will be permanently fixed. In those cases where
distinction is at present doubtful, final definition
of each chromosome can be left until further

Group 13-15 Medium sized chromosomes with nearly
terminal centromeres  (“‘acrocentric”
chromosomes). Chromosome 13 has a
prominent satellite on the short arm.
Chromosome 14 has a small satellite on
the short arm. No satellite has been
detected on chromosome 15.

Rather short chromosomes with approximately median (in chromosome 16) or
submedian centromeres.

Group 16-18

Short chromosomes with approximately
median centromeres.

Group 21-22 Very short, acrocentric chromosomes.

Chromosome 21 has a satellite on its
short arm. The Y chromosome is similar
to these chromosomes.

knowledge has accrued, though an attempt is
made to provide a characterization of each.
These principles make it possible to draw up a
conspectus of the chromosomes, a table of their
quantitative characteristics and a table of the
synonyms which authors have already published.
These are appended (Tables 1, 2 and 3).

In Table 2, showing the diagnostic characters
of the chromosomes, three parameters are relied
upon. These are: (1) The length of each chromosome relative to the total length of a normal,
X-containing, haploid set, i.e., the sum of the
lengths of the 22 autosomes and of the X chromosome, expressed per thousand; (2) The arm
ratio of the chromosomes expressed as the
length of the longer arm relative to the shorter
one; and (3) The centromeric index expressed
as the ratio of the length of the shorter arm to the
whole length of the chromosome. The two latter
indices are, of course, related algebraically quite
simply, but it is thought useful to present both
here. In some chromosomes, the additional
criterion of the presence of a satellite is available
(Table 1), but in view of the apparent morphological variation of satellites, they and their
connecting strands are excluded in computing
the indices.

Table 2 shows the range of measurements
determined by various workers. Some of the
variation expresses the uncertainty due to
measurement of relatively small objects; but
many of the discrepancies between different
A PROPOSED STANDARD SYSTEM OF NOMENCLATURE OF HUMAN MITOTIC CHROMOSOMES

workers’ observations are due to the measurement of chromosomes at different stages of
mitosis and to the effect of different methods of
pre-treatment and preparation for microscopic
study. The ranges shown, therefore, represent
the maxima and minima of the means found by
different workers using different techniques.
However, within any one worker’s observations,
the variations are not so broad.

Reference should be made to two other matters
of nomenclature. In the first place, it is considered that no separate nomenclature for the
groups is needed. It is considered that any group
to which it may be necessary to refer will be a
sequence of those designated by Arabic numerals. Hence, any chromosome group may be

referred to by the Arabic numerals of the
extreme chromosomes of the group, joined
together by a hyphen, e.g., the group of the three
longest chromosomes would be Group 1-3.
This scheme has the merit of great flexibility.
For instance, chromosomes X and 6 may be
separated from the Group 6-12 whenever they
can be distinguished.

Secondly, there is the problem raised by the
abnormal chromosomes which are being encountered in the more recent studies. Their
nomenclature was discussed without a definite
conclusion being reached. Broadly, it was
agreed, however, that any symbol used should
avoid incorporating a specific interpretation
which was not reasonably established. It was

suggested that arbitrary symbols, prefixed by a
designation of the laboratory of origin, should
usually be assigned to theabnormalchromosome.

In this connection, two further requisites for
co-ordination of research were discussed. One
is the storage of documentation for reference,
perhaps in a central depository, additional to
what it may be possible to publish. The other is
the desirability that cultures be preserved, by
the satisfactory methods now used, so that they
are available for reference, comparison and
exchange.

Some consideration was also given to the
desirability of using a uniform system for presenting karyotypes and idiograms, but recognizing that individual variation in taste is involved, rigidity of design was thought undesirable. However, it was recommended that

*In the published idiogram the chromosomes of group 6-12 (including X) were indicated by discontinuous lines and left unnumbered
owing to the uncertainty of di ination at that time. For the
purpose of this table, these chromosomes have been assigned the
numbers shown in parenthesis, in serial order of length.

the chromosomes should be arranged in numerical order, with the sex chromosomes near
to but separated from the autosomes they
resemble. It is desirable that similar ones be
grouped together with their centromeres aligned.

It is recognized that choice between the
different possible schemes of nomenclature is
arbitrary, but that uniformity for ease of
reference is essential. Hence, individual preferences have been subordinated to the common
good in reaching this agreement. This human
chromosomes study group therefore agrees touse
this notation and recommends that any who
prefer to use any other scheme should, at the
same time, also refer to the Standard System
proposed here.

We are well aware of the wide interest in the
work of this study group and realize that this
meeting is merely a preliminary to a larger
meeting. It is believed that two needs have to be
met in this respect. One is for seminars and
workshops at which workers in the field may
exchange information; such seminars are best
arranged regionally. The second need, which
may come later, is for international conferences ;
and we believe that Congresses and other
organizations whose interests include human
genetics, should promote such meetings.
