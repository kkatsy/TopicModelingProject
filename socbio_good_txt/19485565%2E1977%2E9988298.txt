ABSTRACT: While inbreeding levels have declined in most parts of the world, they are still high in
South India. Based on a major study of rural and urban population samples, the extent of
inbreeding in Tamil Nadu, one of the southern states of India, is presented and analyzed in
relation to specific socioeconomic and demographic factors. The inbreeding coefficients (Wright’s
F) in the rural and urban areas were 0.0371 and 0.0204, respectively. Although the levels were
generally high in all population groups, the coefficients showed significant variations by religion,
education, and occupational status of the couple, and by place of residence. Data over the past
several decades indicate that inbreeding continues to be maintained at relatively high levels even

today.

Theoretical treatises based largely on
sociocultural studies are found on the origin of incest taboos and consanguinity
regulations (Tylor, 1889; Westermark,
1921; Freud, 1946; Levi-Strauss, 1949;
Parsons, 1954). Currently, there are only a
few populations in the world that show a
preference toward consanguineous marriages. In a majority of these populations,
the levels of inbreeding are rather low,
rarely exceeding 5 per cent of the marriages and with inbreeding coefficients less
than 0.01 (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer,
1971).

The average inbreeding coefficient in
Europe has been reported as varying between 0.00005 and 0.0011 (Pohlman,
1951; Sutter, 1958; Deraemaeker, 1958).
In the Americas, the inbreeding coefficients vary from 0.00009 to 0.00119
(Freire-Maia, 1968). One of the few national populations with substantial levels
of inbreeding is Japan. Schull and Neel
(1965) estimate the frequency of consanguineous marriage to be around 10 per
cent of all marriages in Japan, with the
inbreeding coefficients between 0.008 and
0.003. Only in certain small isolates can

one observe higher levels of inbreeding,
such as 0.0254 among the Dunkers of
Pennsylvania (Glass et al., 1954), 0.0365
on the island of Tristan da Cunha (Bailit
et al., 1966), and 0.0434 among the
Samaritan isolates in the Middle East
(Bonne, 1963).

In contrast, there seems to exist in
southern parts of India a high level of
inbreeding extending to large populations
across all religions and socioeconomic
groups. An earlier report from the state of
Tamil Nadu indicated the frequency of
consanguineous marriages in the rural and
urban areas as around 50 per cent and 30
per cent of all marriages, respectively (Rao
et al., 1972). Closer scrutiny of these populations through detailed analyses using inbreeding coefficients are presented and
discussed in this paper.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The population samples for this research were taken from the district of
North Arcot (population 3.76 million,
1971 census) in Tamil Nadu. The demographic characteristics of the district such

as the fertility and mortality levels and age
and social structures are fairly typical of
those prevailing in other parts of the state.
The principal local language is Tamil.
About 91 per cent of the population are
Hindus, 6 per cent are Muslims, about 2
per cent are Christians, and other religious
groups (mostly Jains and Buddhists) make
up the remaining per cent. The urban
sample was chosen from the town of Vellore, the headquarters of the district. An
adjoining rural area provided the rural

sample. Based on a previous socioeco
nomic and environmental survey, all resident households in the 15 localities of the
town of Vellore were assigned to three
census “tracts”. Tract I (2 localities) had
the highest socioeconomic and environmental conditions and Tract III (4
localities), the lowest. Tract IT (9 localities)
was intermediate. A sample of 5 localities
was randomly chosen, 1 from Tract I, 3
from Tract II, and 1 from Tract III, containing in all a population sample of about
40,000.

The district of North Arcot has 13
taluks (subdivisions of a district), of which
Gudiyatham is one. This taluk is divided
into 4 panchayat unions (community development blocks), one of which is the K.
V. Kuppam panchayat union made up of
41 panchayats (village bodies). Twentyfive geographically contiguous panchayats
with a population of about 50,000 were
chosen as the rural sample for the study.
The socioeconomic and environmental
conditions in the remaining 16 panchayats
were not significantly different from those
in the selected panchayats.

All the married women in the selected
areas were contacted by the research
team to collect socioeconomic and demographic data. For each marriage, a family
pedigree was drawn extending upward
two earlier generations on the side of each
spouse in order to determine the existence
and type of consanguinity involved. This

Rao and Inbaraj

procedure was followed uniformly for all
marriages. Five per cent of all married
women were later reinterviewed by supervisory personnel to check the validity
of the pedigrees.

Women who were fluent in the local
language (Tamil) and who had undergone
the auxiliary-nurse midwives’ course or
some other basic course in health science
were the original interviewers. They were
intensively trained for their roles in the
research project and in interview methods. Each interviewer was responsible for
a population of about 4,000 in the rural
areas and of about 5,000 in the urban
areas. For every four interviewers, there
was a supervisor (female) and a coordinator (male).

The investigators were given thorough
training in drawing family pedigrees and
in interview techniques required to obtain
data on consanguinity. Subsequently,
standardizations among the investigations
were done. Every pedigree was checked
with at least one other adult member of
the family. On the basis of reinterview by
supervisory personnel, it was found that
misclassification of a consanguineous marrlage aS nonconsanguineous or viceversa was practically zero. Likewise, misclassifications of uncle-niece and _firstcousin marriages were rare. Only for relationships beyond that of first cousin were
there some minor discrepancies. In the
present analyses, all consanguineous marriages beyond that of first-cousin matings
have been grouped into one class.

The frequency of consanguinity can be
expressed as a proportion of all such marriages among total marriages contracted
during a given time period or studied in
terms of the coefficient of inbreeding, F
(Wright, 1922). The value of F would be 0
in the absence of consanguinity and 1
when there was complete inbreeding. The
value of F for the uncle-niece matings is
taken as % or 0.125, for the first-cousin
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 24, No. 4

marriages as 1/16 or 0.0625, for the
second-cousin matings as 0.0156, etc. A
weighted mean for the whole population,
taking into account the relative frequencies of various values of F, is denoted by
a.

Although F and a are parameters
characterizing the offspring and not the
mated couples, for the purposes of this
paper the number of couples and not the
number of offspring are used in the various computations.

For each marriage, the value of F and
other relevant data were coded and transferred to 80-column punch cards. An
IBM-370 computer was used in tabulations and statistical analyses.

RESULTS

Nearly 47 per cent of the rural women
and 29 per cent of the urban women were
consanguineously married. The common
types of such marriages are shown in
Table 1 and Figure 1.

sexed sibs (cross first cousins) seemed significantly more frequent than those between children of like-sexed sibs (parallel
first cousins), as shown in Table 2.

Even among the cross first cousins, it
can be seen that a boy is much more likely
to marry his mother’s brother’s daughter
than to marry his father’s sister’s daughter. These preferences can only be attributed to timeworn cultural traditions, and
there were no significant age differences
between the spouses of the various kinds
of first-cousin matings.

Based on Wright’s F, the average inbreeding coefficients in the rural and
urban areas were 0.0371 and 0.0204, respectively. These rates are significantly
higher than those prevalent in most parts
of the world.

Analysis by religion showed that parallel first-cousin marriages were seen relatively more frequently among Muslims
than among Hindus or Christians, as
shown in Table 3. In fact, among urban

his sister’s daughter.

dependent on the educational level, the
inbreeding coefficients by occupations of
women and of their husbands showed patterns similar to those seen in Table 4.
However, in certain occupational groups,
such as agricultural laborers, semiskilled
workers in cottage industries, and service
workers, there were significantly higher
coefficients of inbreeding as compared to
those in the white-collar group in both the
rural and urban areas (P < 0.05). It should
be pointed out, however, that differentials
by occupational categories were more pronounced in the rural than in the urban
areas.

Inbreeding coefficients by religion of
rural and urban couples are presented in
Table 5. The highest coefficients of inbreeding were seen for Hindus; nearly 1.5
times those seen among Muslims or Christians. In general, the inbreeding rates

were lower in urban than in rural areas for
all religious groups.

The Hindu community consists of
hierarchical groups (castes and subcastes),
each with its own rights, duties, and privileges. The various caste names are derived
from the principal professions or crafts
their members practiced. Thus, the Brahmins conducted prayers and religious
rituals and were involved in teaching;
Kshatriyas were rulers and warriors. The

potters, blacksmiths, carpenters, washermen, etc., each had their own caste
names. The castes at the top had power
and privileges which were denied to the
lower castes, who were tenants, servants,
landless laborers, debtors, and clients of
the higher castes. In recent years, the
lower castes have shown an increasing
desire to free themselves from the control
of the locally dominant castes and have
been assisted by political forces operating
from higher levels. However, the social
status of an individual is still dependent on
his caste. The caste status of communities
in this study can be classified into three
groups: (1) the “Forward” communities,
consisting of higher caste groups, including Brahmins, those engaged primarily in
white-collar jobs, and some skilled workers; (2) the “Backward” communities,
consisting of the traditionally lower castes
such as those involved in semiskilled work
or manual labour; and (3) the “Scheduled”
communities, composed of tribal and caste
groups who have remained aloof from the
mainstream of the society and are the most
undeveloped.

The inbreeding coefficients by castes
varied from 0.05 to less than 0.02. In general, the coefficients in the urban areas
were lower than those in the rural areas
for each of these castes, the differences
attaining statistical significance (P <
0.05).

The inbreeding coefficients are given in
Table 6 for the three groups of communities having different social statuses.

between rural and urban areas for each
status group attain statistical significance
(P < 0.001). In both areas, the Backward
communities show the highest coefficients
of inbreeding. The lowest F-values are
seen for the Forward communities in the
rural areas, but for the Scheduled communities in the urban areas. The differences between these two groups, however,
are not statistically significant (0.2 <P <
0.4).

Inbreeding coefficients by year of consummation of marriage of couples did not
reveal significant declines over the past
five decades. The inbreeding coefficients
in the rural and urban areas were 0.0297
and 0.0189, respectively, for those married in 1919 or earlier and 0.0304 and
0.0173 for those married in 1960 or later.

DISCUSSION

Most investigations of consanguineous
marriages have relied on documentary
evidence such as civil marriage registers,
church registers of marriages and of special dispensations needed for consanguineous marriages, hospital records, and
registers maintained in rehabilitation institutes or recorded genealogies (CavalliSforza and Bodmer, 1971). These sources
are not all of the same quality and suffer
from many limitations. They represent
“selécted” population groups where the
amount and types of bias remain unknown, and they may have various kinds
of inaccuracies. Incest, as well as illegal
marriages, may not have been recorded.
However, these data provide some idea of
the incidence of consanguineous marriage
in various societies and at certain periods
of time. The Japanese studies have a special advantage because of the existence of
family registers, the koseki, that provide
documentary evidence of the type of consanguinity involved, if any (Schull and
Neel, 1965). Population-based samples
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

Vol. 24, No. 4

and community surveys, such as the present study, provide relatively superior material for study, although they are costly
since considerable time is required for the
collection of reliable data.

Prohibition of sexual relations among
persons in certain kinship categories appears to be one of the few universal social
restrictions on human behavior (Lorimer,
1954). In practice, this. principle is expressed in an infinite variety of rules,
mythological justifications, and types and
degrees of extension. While there are a
large number of castes and tribes in India,
this situation does not necessarily lead to a
great deal of inbreeding, since the numerical strength of the different groups is
sufficiently large to provide many possibilities for monconsanguineous marriages. Further, there are many regulations governing marriages between close
relatives. The regulations have been
strictly enforced in northern India, especially by the Brahmins, who greatly
influence the marriage customs of other
population groups. However, in southern
India the regulations had to be relaxed
considerably to conform to the prevailing
marked preferences for consanguineous
marriages (Sanghvi, 1966). In the present
study, the extent of consanguinity is fairly
high in all of the major religious groups,
although some significant differences were
found (Table 6).

There are many reasons for the preference for consanguineous marriages, but
the chief one is socioeconomic. In a study
of the mating customs of people residing in
one of the southern states of India, Andhra
Pradesh, Dronamraju (1964) cites the
main reasons, as stated by the respondents, for preferring consanguineous
marriages: (a) to keep the cultivable land
in larger subdivisions for growing food
crops such as rice; (b) parental influence;
(c) the extreme youth of the brides; (d)
mutual knowledge of families concerned;

and (e) economic benefits, since the parents and the grandparents of the consanguineous spouses and their descendants
can all live together in joint families, pooling their resources and sharing all expenditures.

A sizeable proportion of marriages are
still arranged by parents, for whom the
perpetuation and prosperity of the family
takes precedence over individual preferences about marriage partners. Even in
the urban areas, a significant proportion of
marriages are still arranged by the parents, regardless of differentials in educational or occupational status of the spouses
involved (Tables 4 and 5).

Studies in most parts of the world have
shown significant declines in the incidence
of consanguineous marriages. For example, in the Netherlands, the frequency of
consanguineous marriages declined from
0.7 per cent in 1906-18 to 0.2 per cent
during 1937-48 (Pohlman, 1951). In Belgium, the frequency declined from 1.4 per
cent at the turn of century to less than 0.9
per cent by 1950 (Deraemaeker, 1958).
However, in southern India, the declines
over the past few decades do not seem
significant.

If a character whose correlation with
inbreeding is being investigated happens
to show a geographical-social stratification, then spurious correlations can be
easily obtained. This point must be borne
in mind when exploring inbreeding effects
on human populations in different parts of
the world where consanguineous marriages have declined to rather insignificant
levels. Likewise, studies based on parish
records or genealogies maintained by select population groups are liable to suffer
from varying degrees of bias which can
never be adequately estimated or corrected for. In contrast, community-based
studies on southern Indian populations
offer excellent opportunities to study inbreeding effects, in view of the wide popuDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

larity of consanguineous marriages. Such
investigations would also be helpful in determining the long-term effects of inbreeding on specific gene frequencies.
