ABSTRACT: Relatively little attention has been given to the interpretation of age-at-marriage
differences in fertility. This paper discusses possible demographic and sociological sources of this
differential. The argument is made that sociological interpretations deserve increased attention
since most of the observed differential persists after control for likely demographic components
(premarital pregnancy, unwanted fertility, and subfecundity) and for correlated social and background variables (education of self and parents, religion, farm background, number of siblings,
whether respondent’s parental family was intact, and husband’s age at marriage). Multipleclassification analysis is employed. The analysis concludes by noting that age at first birth has an
even stronger relationship with fertility than age at marriage and that the sociological dimensions
of age relevant to age at marriage are even more appropriate to age at entrance into motherhood.

Although age at marriage is one of the
strongest and most persistent factors affecting fertility, the nature of its effect has
received little attention. The earliest
Growth of American Families Study noted
the importance of the age-at-marriage differential in fertility and suggested that
fecundity was not likely to be a major part
of its explanation (Freedman et al., 1959).
While a number of others have commented briefly on this relationship (e.g.,
Glass and Grebenik, 1954; Grabill et al.,
1958; Westoff et al., 1963; Bumpass, 1969;
Westoff, 1975), most often age at marriage
has been treated primarily as a variable to
be controlled in the analysis of other variables. Busfield (1972) is an exception, and
a number of the issues discussed here are
considered for England and Wales in his
work.

In populations with little fertility control, age-at-marriage differentials in fertility are a rather straightforward consequence of differences in length of exposure
to the risk of conception (Coale and Tye,
1961). However, in modern contracepting
populations, this demographic component

is heavily conditioned by social factors
such as effective contraceptive use and selective marriage patterns. In addition,
several sociological hypotheses directly relating age and fertility decisions warrant
examination. As other fertility differentials contract in modern societies, the ageat-marriage effect becomes increasingly
important to the sociology of fertility
(Westoff, 1975).

Two sorts of demographic factors may
be involved in age-at-marriage differences
in fertility in modern populations. The
first is a modified version of the differential-exposure-time model in which “risk”
becomes the conditional risk of unwanted
birth given contraception. Obviously, the
consequence of differing lengths of exposure decreases with improved contraceptive efficacy. Nevertheless, we would expect a continuing effect (Ryder and Westoff, 1972), except in the extreme case of
universal sterilization at the birth of the
last wanted child.

This effect has an exposure-time component and a risk component. The time
component is obvious. Other things being

equal, the remaining years of risk after the
birth of the last wanted child will be fewer
for those marrying later. Average levels of
risk of unwanted fertility may differ because women who marry later have a
higher proportion of the years at risk in the
period of declining fecundity and more effective contraception (Ryder, 1973). However, there may be further differences in
the average level of risk if there is any
selection of the more fecund or less effective planners into younger ages at marriage.

Such selectivity is plausible in a society
where a high proportion of those who
marry young are pregnant at marriage
(perhaps 50 per cent of teenage marriages).
Given the vastly inadequate nature of contraceptive use among unmarried teenage
girls (Kantner and Zelnik, 1972), there
could well be a tendency among those with
sexual experience for the more fecund to
get “caught” by pregnancy and for the less
fecund to “survive” the risk of pregnancy
to marry later. If this were the case, those
who married young might be exposed to
higher rates of risk of unwanted pregnancy, compared to women of the same
age and contraceptive protection who
married at later ages. The same selectivity
might result in differences in contraceptive
ability, as well as in fecundity, being associated with early marriage. In one longitudinal analysis, higher fertility was
found for those who had been premaritally
pregnant, net of social status factors, parity, methods of fertility control, and
family-size expectations at the first interview (Wilson and Bumpass, 1973). We
will explicitly evaluate the contribution of
differentials in premarital pregnancy and
in unwanted fertility to age-at-marriage
differences in family size.

The second major demographic component may be an effect of age at marriage
on wanted fertility as a consequence of
increased subfecundity with age. In low

Social Biology

fertility populations, most women who
marry “late” have sufficient remaining
fecund years in which to bear an average
number of children. Nevertheless, it is
undoubtedly the case that higher proportions of late than of earlier marriers are
unable to have all the children they want
(Freedman et al., 1959). The measurement
of the role of subfecundity in completed
family size is fraught with difficulty, but
we will make some attempt to estimate the
role of this factor in age-at-marriage differences in fertility.

Finally, we must be concerned with the
degree to which the age-at-marriage differential in fertility reflects the correlation
of age at marriage with other factors, of
which wife’s education is perhaps the most
important.

To the extent that the age-at-marriage
effect is attributable neither to fertility
control variables nor to correlated socioeconomic variables, sociological explanations relating directly to age at marriage
seem appropriate. One type of hypothesis
relates to premarital and early marital socialization experiences; another is concerned with factors affecting the decision
to terminate childbearing. The first type of
explanation holds that entrance into marriage at later ages increases the opportunity for socialization into nonfamilial adult
roles (Bumpass, 1969; Presser, 1971).
When marriage and childbearing are
begun early, each subsequent decision
stage is reached at a less mature age than it
is for women who begin the process later.
This is an obvious but nontrivial point
that bears elaboration. One dimension involves the extent to which secondary socialization for completing adult roles has
occurred. For example, women who have
their second child in their teens may contracept and consider the possibility of a
third child in a markedly different field of
perceived alternatives than do women
who reach this stage in their mid-twenties. A
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 24, No. 1

further dimension relates to the socioemotional maturity with which those perceived alternatives and consequences are
weighed. Knowledge of long-run consequences, the extent to which future consequences are discounted against immediate
gains, and the general orientation toward
risk-taking in fertility behavior (Luker,
1975) are likely to be markedly different
among teenagers in a way that accelerates
the pace of childbearing (Bumpass et al.,
in press).

The resulting short birth intervals could
lead to higher “intended” fertility through
the early foreclosure of options. If anything is learned during the early twenties
that might lead women to believe that two
children (or one, for that matter) fulfill
social and personal goals of motherhood, a
significant proportion of teenage mothers
will learn these lessons too late for it to
affect their fertility. The earlier they begin
childbearing, the more likely this is to be
the case. One very important component
of this learning may be a specification of
the perceived-alternatives hypothesis, i.e.,
the moral force of the normative expectation of “at least two children” may seem
less compelling to women who are more
aware of alternatives. An alternative hypothesis is simply that there is a selection
into early marriage of women who are
more oriented toward motherhood.

The second type of explanation centers
around the role of age in the decision to
terminate childbearing. There may well be
diffuse social norms which indicate that
there is a point beyond which a woman is
“too old” to have more children. In the
popular image, couples with children are,
by and large, young people. This notion of
“too old” carries both sociological and
quasi-biological content. In the latter case,
persons who marry late may progressively
feel that they no longer have sufficient
energy to cope with intensive infant care
even though they might have continued

Marriage Age and Family Size

33

childbearing if they had reached the same
parity at an earlier age. Being “too old” is
often reported as a reason for not having more children (Rainwater, 1965;
Whelpton et al., 1966; Hoffman, 1975).
Another aspect of this same dimension is
the realization that while they may still
have sufficient energy for this task (at a
given age and parity), such energy
(broadly including the remaining healthy
years) is a scarce resource. To the extent
that these years are devoted to childbearing, the couple will have relatively less
time for other goals (such as travel) after
childbearing, compared with couples who
married early and achieved the same desired parity.

A related component may involve the
sense of being “in phase” with one’s age
cohort. To the extent that couples marry
later and achieve a given parity at an older
age than their age cohorts, to continue
childbearing implies a set of constraints
throughout the later stages of the marriage
life cycle “out of phase” with their age
peers. Intensive infant care, then babysitting problems, and teenage children tie a
couple down in each phase while age peers
who married earlier are beyond the phase.
We will be unable to offer much to choose
among in these sociological interpretations
of the age-at-marriage differential, but we
hope to provide some evidence on the extent to which the alternative demographic
explanations can be excluded.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data are drawn from the 1965 and
1970 National Fertility Studies, national
probability samples of married women in
the childbearing ages (Ryder and Westoff,
1976). We will focus on white oncemarried women who were married 10-15
years before interview. These women
have been married long enough to have
completed most of their childbearing.
Total intended family size is used as the

dependent variable to take into account
that small portion of intended fertility that
has not yet occurred. Since there are remaining years of risk of unwanted fertility
for this marriage cohort, the analysis may
understate the level of unwanted fertility
and perhaps the proportion of a completed
fertility differential by age at marriage
that is attributable to unwanted fertility.
However, this truncation of experience
should not affect the estimate of the intended component of the age-at-marriage
differential. Women who gave birth prior
to their first marriage have been excluded.

A marriage cohort, rather than a birth
cohort, is employed in order to compare
women who experienced similar marriage
life-cycle stages during similar historical
periods. Given the very radical swings in
period fertility over the last two decades,
comparisons of different ages at marriage
within a birth cohort might confound
period differences with age-at-marriage
differences.

variable regression analysis in the form of
deviations from the grand mean. The various models relate to the issues outlined
above. The gross effects represent the observed differences in fertility by age at
marriage in this sample, ranging from 3.7
for the youngest group at marriage to 2.4
for the oldest in 1965, and from 3.5 to 2.5,
respectively, for these age groups in 1970.
This effect of age at marriage is not linear,
but occurs primarily through the distinctly
higher fertility of those who marry before
age 18 and the lower fertility of those who
marry after 25. (Somewhat less than onethird of the women in our samples married
at these ages.)

The first model tests whether selectivity
into early marriage through premarital
pregnancy plays any role in the age-atmarriage effect on fertility. Controlling for
premarital pregnancy does not at all reduce the effect of age at marriage. First
births are coded as premarital pregnancies
if they occurred before eight months after
the date of marriage. While we know that

premarital pregnancy is substantially underrecorded in survey data, the lack of any
reduction in Model 1 casts strong doubt on
either version of the selectivity hypothesis
discussed above.

The second model includes a number of
factors that are correlated with both age at
marriage and fertility and that hence
might be partially responsible for this relationship. Most important of these factors
is the respondent’s education, though also
included are education of both her parents, number of siblings, whether her parental family was intact, farm background, whether she is Catholic, and her
husband’s age at marriage. Controlling for
all of these vaiables actually increases the
differential very slightly in both samples
(negligibly in 1970). We conclude that the
age-at-marriage effect is not at all a consequence of either selectivity by premarital
pregnancy or of correlated background
variables.

The next three models control sequentially and then jointly for subfecundity
and the number of unwanted births. A

Marriage Age and Family Size 35

birth is coded as unwanted if a woman
reported that she did not want to become
pregnant again before the pregnancy in
question. The measurement of subfecundity is extremely problematic, but we are
able to measure fairly well the component
we are concerned with here. Women are
coded as subfecund if they reported that
they are unable to have a child because of
involuntary sterility (whether or not an
operation is the cause). In the absence of
an operation, it is primarily those women
who have tried to become pregnant and
failed who discover their subfecundity,
but these are the women most directly relevant to the issue we are considering. As
expected, we find that both aspects of fertility control contribute to the observed
age-at-marriage differential in fertility.
When unwanted births and subfecundity
are controlled, the difference between the
two extreme age-at-marriage groups is reduced by about one-third in both years.
Table 2 presents these analyses limited
to mothers in the 1970 sample, first on the
basis of age at marriage and then employ

ing age at first birth instead. A comparison
of the gross effect for age at marriage in
this table to that for the 1970 datain Table
1 indicates that about a third of the gross
differential in Table 1 is a product of differences by age at marriage in the level of
childlessness. A comparison of the models
including subfecundity in the two tables
suggests that much of this reduction occurs through subfecundity of the later ages
of marriage, but some is undoubtedly due
to higher levels of voluntary childlessness
among those who marry at later ages.
Our major purpose in including Table 2
is to permit evaluation of the relative predictive ability of age at first birth compared to age at marriage. The sociological
arguments that we outlined earlier are
even more appropriate to age at first birth,
and in fact apply to age at marriage largely
because of its tie to age at first birth. It is
the early transition to parenthood far more
than early marriage itself that establishes
severe constraints on the opportunity to
develop role patterns that might compete
with motherhood. Indeed, for the same
sample of mothers, net differences in fertility by age at first birth are over twice
those by age at marriage. Even among a
sample restricted to mothers, age at mar

riage has an important net effect on completed family size, but the age-at-firstbirth differential is considerably more impressive. Women who became mothers before their eighteenth birthday had completed families 0.8 larger than those entering motherhood between ages 18 and 24,
whereas women whose first child was born
when they were 25 or older had completed
families 0.4 smaller than this group.

The major point of this exercise is to
document that the age at which marital or
parental roles are initiated has a substantial effect on fertility that cannot be attributed to either control factors or correlated background variables and that consequently is deserving of theoretical attention.
