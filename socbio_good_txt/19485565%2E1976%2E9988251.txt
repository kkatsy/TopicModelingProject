Comment on “The Changing Sex Ratio of
the Navajo Tribe,” by Kunitz and Slocumb

In their paper on “The Changing Sex
Ratio of the Navajo Tribe” in the Spring
1976 issue of Social Biology (Vol. 23, No.
1, pp. 33-44), Kunitz and Slocumb fail to
note or discuss what is almost certainly the
principal source of the anomalous sex ratios in the various populations they mention, probably including the Navajos. The
cause of the otherwise inexplicable figures
is defective census data.

The sequence of sex ratios by age in the
native population in the United States,
when graphed for an early census, say
around 1910, closely resembles the line
traced by the sex ratio of the population of
rural Colombia in Figure 5 of their article,
a pattern also to be found in the nonwhite

 

population of the United States about
1930. The basis for such a sequence of sex
ratios, dipping well below 0.9 in adolescent and early adult ages and rising well
above 1.0 in ages around 50 to age 70 or
higher, is differential omission and differential age misreporting for males and females. No realistic life tables incorporating differential mortality by sex could account for this irregular sequence. In fact,
the only set of sex ratios presented by
Kunitz and Slocumb that appears to be
based on valid data is the set for Japan in
Figure 1. There is really no point in trying
to find social and medical explanations for
variations that are in fact mostly spurious.

figures are discussed in an article written
in 1955 and in a book that was published
in 1963 (A. J. Coale, “Population of the
United States in 1950 Classified by Age,
Sex, and Color,” Journal of the American
Statistical Association, 1955, Vol. 50,

Another pattern of spurious fluctuations
in sex ratios is found in Tropical Africa
(and also in the censuses of many other
populations in Asia and North Africa). See

Press, 1968.
