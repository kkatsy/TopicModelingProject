ABSTRACT: This research examines the infant mortality/socioeconomic status relationship in
Toledo, Ohio, for the years centering around 1950, 1960, and 1970 in order to depict variables
that contributed most to infant mortality for each time period. Zero-order correlation coefficients
demonstrated that the relationship has widened mainly as a result of an increasing inverse
neonatal/socioeconomic pattern which was due in part to a “cause-period cross-over effect”
(exogenous causes of death were contributing to deaths in the neonatal period in 1970). Further
examination suggested that the status variables through which the differentials were operating
have shifted from one time period to another. In 1950, crowded housing conditions and unemployment were primarily responsible; in 1960, it was housing and income; and in 1970, marital
instability and income predominated. This paper suggests that as new social phenomena emerge
they quickly affect sensitive indicators of well-being such as the infant mortality rate.

The infant mortality rate has historically been regarded as a very sensitive
index of differences in the levels of social
and economic well-being among various
population groups (Newsholme, 1910;
Woodbury, 1925). Writing early in the
present century, Newsholme (1910, p. 28)
stated that “infant mortality is the most
sensitive index we possess of social welfare
and of sanitary administration, especially
under urban conditions.” He also stated
that the economic and social conditions
prevailing in a population are inversely
related to mortality levels in general, but
especially to child mortality.

Over the years, the infant mortality rate
has remained relatively consistent and
sensitive to socioeconomic differences on
an international level (Hauser, 1959). Although numerous studies suggest that infant mortality continues to be highly sensitive to socioeconomic differences on an
international level (Stockwell, 1966;
Ekanem, 1972), a number of recent stud
16

ies have raised questions concerning the
precise status of this traditionally inverse
relationship within an advanced, relatively low-mortality country such as the
United States (Willie, 1959; Stockwell,
1962; Donabedian et al., 1965).
Although the traditional pattern has
been one where infant mortality was inversely associated with levels of socioeconomic status, several recent studies have
presented evidence to suggest that this relationship was changing in the United
States. Among these is the study by Willie
(1959, pp. 225-226) who found that “little
association was demonstrated between infant mortality rates and the socioeconomic
status level of ecological areas in Syracuse,
New York.” On the basis of his observations, and since the vast majority of infant
deaths in the United States occur during
the neonatal period, Willie concluded that
socioeconomic status factors appeared to
exert little effect on the patterning of the
distribution of infant mortality rates.

Stockwell’s (1962) study of Providence,
Rhode Island, was consistent with Willie’s
findings. Of the five socioeconomic indexes used, only income exhibited a significant inverse relationship to infant mortality. However, infant mortality still appeared to be sensitive to differences in
other components of socioeconomic status
(e.g., occupation and education) when
analysis was restricted to the postneonatal
component, or to that segment of infant
mortality where the major causes of death
are farther removed from the physiological
processes of gestation and birth. Neonatal
mortality, on the other hand, which accounted for the vast majority of infant
deaths, and where the major causes of
death were more directly associated with
birth (e.g., birth injury, prematurity), displayed a random pattern when related to
socioeconomic status. On the basis of this
evidence, Stockwell (1962, pp. 110-111)
concluded:

we might now be at a point where it is time
to reconsider the assumption pertaining to
the infant mortality rate being the most sensitive index we possess of the level of social
and economic well-being characterizing a
given population group .. . it may well be
that the approximate inverse relationship
noted between socioeconomic status and
postneonatal mortality (where the infectious
diseases continue to take the heaviest toll),
will eventually be eliminated. Should this be
the case, the future could see an even greater
decline in the significance of infant mortality
as an index of socioeconomic status.

Both of the preceding studies contain
the implicit suggestion that where infant
mortality was low, and where the major
proportion of infant deaths take place during the neonatal period and are due to
endogenous causes (e.g., immaturity,
birth injuries, congenital malformations,
postnatal asphyxia), the traditional negative correlation between infant mortality
and socioeconomic status would be
blunted. This is because these causes are

Infant Mortality

primarily physiological in origin and were
not thought to be influenced by environmental differences. However, it was believed that the postneonatal deaths which
take place between the ages of one month
and one year would continue to exhibit an
inverse relationship with socioeconomic
status because the major causes of death at
these ages (e.g., infectious diseases, accidents) are farther removed from the physiological processes of gestation and birth and
are more directly related to environmental
factors.

In explaining this apparent blunting of
the relationship between total infant mortality and socioeconomic status, Willie and
Stockwell suggested that it was due to improved public health measures and the effectiveness of improved medical techniques in fighting infectious causes of
death (Stockwell, 1962), as well as to improved sanitary codes, housing regulations, and the occurrence of practically all
births in hospitals (Willie, 1959). Moreover, it was anticipated that a continuation of these trends would likely promote a
further blunting and perhaps even an
elimination of this mortality differential.
However, this does not seem to have occurred.

On the contrary, an examination of the
findings and conclusions of more recent
studies show that considerable confusion
exists today concerning the nature of the
relationship between infant mortality and
its component parts to socioeconomic
status. On the one hand, in a longitudinal
study of Chicago between 1930 and 1960,
Kitagawa and Hauser (1973) found a considerable narrowing of the socioeconomic
differential in infant mortality. On the
other hand, data for New York City (Institute of Medicine, National Academy of
Sciences, 1973) indicate that the traditional inverse relationship also applies to
the neonatal component of infant mortality. This has been demonstrated for New

York City (1961-63) by father’s occupation (Shapiro et al., 1968). It may also be
noted that this relationship is not unique
to the United States, but has also been
observed in other industrialized lowmortality countries (National Center for
Health Statistics, 1966; 1968a; 19685). Finally, in one other study of trends among
states it was noted that the state data
comparing the infant mortality/socioeconomic status relationship remained unchanged from 1938 to 1968 for occupation
and education, while for per cent black,
the relationship increased (Brooks, 1975b),
a finding which was contrary to expectations.

It should be obvious from the preceding
discussion that the relationship between
infant mortality and socioeconomic status
is a topic requiring continued research.
The evidence currently suggests that this
relationship is markedly inverse (Brooks,
1975a, 19756; Markides and Barnes,
1977). Further, because they are due to
different causes and are therefore likely to
require different remedial programs, the
neonatal and postneonatal components of
infant mortality need to be examined separately in relation to the various socioeconomic variables to determine adequately
the nature of this relationship. The aim of
the present research, a longitudinal study
of the relationship between infant mortality (total, neonatal and postneonatal) and
selected measures of socioeconomic status
in the city of Toledo, Ohio, is to present
data to try to clarify some of the present
confusion and to enhance our knowledge
and understanding of this relationship.

Since most research in this area examined socioeconomic differentials referring
to the widening or narrowing of the subgroup gap based on various measures of
education, occupation, income, etc., these
same studies neglected to assess the overall
impact and to differentiate the socioeconomic variables that were most sensitive

Social Biology

to infant mortality. Specifically, the main
purpose of this research is to examine the
overall infant mortality/socioeconomic
status relationship and to identify the
variables that contributed most to infant
mortality for each time period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The present research on the relationship
between the components of infant mortality and various measures of socioeconomic
status employs an ecological approach.
The basic unit of analysis is the census
tract of mother’s usual residence. In order
to calculate infant and component mortality rates, infant deaths and live births for
each of the same 53 census tracts centering
around the years 1950, 1960, and 1970 had
to be known. From the Bureau of Vital
Statistics, Toledo Department of Health,
data on infant deaths were collected for
the periods January 1, 1949 to December
31, 1951 and January 1, 1969 to December
31, 1971. For the central census years 1950
and 1970, data on live births were collected for each tract from microfilm records. The infant deaths and live births
for the period, January 1, 1959 to December 31, 1961 were obtained from data
tapes provided by the Ohio Department of
Health.

In calculating rates, we used the conventional procedure of relating the average number of deaths occurring during the
three years for each time period covered to
the number of live births in the central
census year. This procedure minimizes the
possible influences of chance fluctuations
in the year-to-year number of infant
deaths. Socioeconomic characteristics of the
population in each census tract were obtained from the 1950, 1960, and 1970 census of population and housing census tract
statistics published by the Bureau of the
Census.

teristics, the independent variables, as
well as the dependent variables utilized in
this study are described as follows. The
independent variables were categorized
into three groups: (1) economic status
variables; (2) family status variables; and
(3) housing status variables.

INDEPENDENT VARIABLES

Economic Status Variables
High School Education: Per cent age 25
and over who are high schoo! graduates.
White Collar: Per cent of employed persons age 16 and over who are employed
in white collar occupations (professional, technical, managers, administrators, sales, clerical and kindred
workers).
Income: Median annual income of families and unrelated individuals.

Family Status Variables
Unemployed: Per cent of labor force
who are unemployed.
Female Labor Force: Per cent of women
16 and over who are in the labor force.
Marital Instability: Per cent of population age 14 and over widowed or divorced.

Housing Status Variables
Crowding: Per cent of dwelling units
with 1.01 or more persons per room.
Single Units: Per cent of housing units
that are single family housing units.

Race Variable (control variable)
Nonwhite: Per cent of population who
are nonwhite.

DEPENDENT VARIABLES

Infant Mortality Rate: The average number of infant deaths in a three-year period per 1,000 live births during the central census years.

Neonatal Mortality Rate: The average
number of deaths of infants under 28
days of age in a three-year period per
1,000 live births during the central census year.

Infant Mortality

 

19

Postneonatal Mortality Rate: The average
number of deaths of infants age one
month to one year in a three year period
per 1,000 live births during the central
census year.

CORRELATIONAL TECHNIQUE

The correlational technique used to
measure the impact of socioeconomic
status on infant mortality was the squared
semipartial correlation coefficient. The
semipartial correlation coefficient (s7)
measures more directly the contribution of
each variable to the variation of the dependent variable. In other words, it is the
correlation between all of Y and X, from
which X» has been partialled. It is a
semipartial correlation since the effects of
X~» have been removed from X, but not
from Y. The effect of X_ is taken out only
from the independent variable X,; by performing a simple linear regression of Xz on
X,, and then this residual of X, is correlated with the dependent variable (Nie
et al., 1975; Cohen and Cohen, 1975).

The semipartial correlation squared (sr?)
is interpreted as the proportion of variance
in the dependent variable (Y) uniquely associated with an independent variable
(X,); thus, sv? is the increase in the squared
multiple correlation (R?) when the independent variable (X,) is added to the other
independent variables (X....). Therefore, the sv? enables the researcher to evaluate the impact of the residualized independent variable with the total Y variance
(Cohen and Cohen, 1975).

Due to the relatively small size of the
nonwhite population in Toledo and the
associated small number of infant deaths,
especially in 1950, the semipartial technique could not be used for either a separate analysis of nonwhite infant mortality
differentials or for a white-nonwhite comparison. Therefore, per cent nonwhite was
used as a control variable in the analysis.

Each of the eight independent variables

was associated with each of the three dependent variables and an sr? was computed for each relationship controlling on
per cent nonwhite. Associating independent and dependent variables in this fashion would permit an intuitive grasp of the
dynamics of importance, dominance, and
explanatory power of socioeconomic status
on infant mortality for each of the three
time periods under investigation.

RESEARCH LIMITATIONS

A limitation of ecological research involves the problem of making inferences
about individual characteristics using
aggregate data and commiting what is
known as the “ecological fallacy.” As long
as one recognizes the limitations of ecological research and does not make inference
from the aggregate to the individual level,
ecological relationships are important,
both theoretically and practically. A main
advantage of such studies is that their geographic specificity provides a valuable
guide to structuring local governmental
programs of health care that are usually
implemented on a geographic basis.

RESULTS

The three time periods under investigation yield a peculiar component percentage change for total, white, and nonwhite
infant mortality as shown in Table 1. For
the white population, total infant and
neonatal mortality declined consistently
and markedly from 1950 to 1970, while
the postneonatal rate remained unchanged
between 1950 and 1960 and declined only
slightly between 1960 and 1970. For nonwhites, on the other hand, all rates declined markedly between 1950 and 1960,
but the 1960~70 decade saw a continued
neonatal decline offset by a sizeable increase in the postneonatal mortality rate.
This latter increase was so great that it
resulted in a slight rise in the nonwhite
total infant mortality rate during the most

Social Biology

recent period. The exact significance of
this increase is unclear, but it may reflect
the increase in the number and proportion
of blacks, particularly lower socioeconomic status blacks, in the Toledo population. The net effect of these trends has
been an overall marked decline in overall
infant mortality, and especially neonatal
mortality, while the postneonatal mortality rate has risen slightly.

The component percentages shown in
Table 1 are fairly consistent for the total,
white, and nonwhite population from
1950 to 1960. However, the 1970 component percentages are markedly different
from both 1950 and 1960 for the three
population groups. The percentage of infant deaths in the postneonatal period increased from 1960 to 1970, and conversely
the percentage of deaths in the neonatal
period declined appreciably during this
period, where 67.7 per cent and 32.3 per
cent of infant deaths occurred in the
neonatal and postneonatal periods for the
total population, respectively, compared
to 76.2 and 23.8 for the neonatal and postneonatal period in 1960.

CAUSE TYPE AND PERIOD OF DEATH

This section briefly analyzes cause and
period of death for the three time periods
under investigation. A two-group causetype classification was used (endogenous
and exogenous).

Endogenous causes of death usually
correspond to neonatal mortality (birth—1
month) because these causes are directly
attributable to the birth process. Exogenous causes, on the other hand, generally
correspond to postneonatal mortality (1
month through 11 months) and are usually
attributable to environmental factors. The
following causes of death and the corresponding cause of death codes were included in each broad endogenous and
exogenous category (World Health Organization, 1957):

population in 1970. The per cent of white
infant deaths occurring in the  postneonatal period were 21.6, 23.9, and 29.3
in 1950, 1960, and 1970, respectively. The
per cent of infant deaths occurring in the
exogenous cause type were 20.9, 22.2,
and 43.7 per cent for the same years.
These trends indicate by period definition
that more infant deaths occurred in the
postneonatal period in 1970, and by cause
definition, exogenous causes had a higher
percentage than the per cent of infant
deaths in the postneonatal period. Exogenous causes of death were contributing to
more than their share of postneonatal
deaths. That is, exogenous causes of
death were contributing to deaths in the
neonatal period. This occurred for the
total and white population but not for the
nonwhite population. Thus, the white
population contributed to the overall pattern in 1970.

In sum, the cause of death analysis suggested that for both the total and white
populations, exogenous (postneonatal)
causes, rather than endogenous causes,
were increasingly contributing to neonatal
deaths. In 1950 and 1960 the correspondence between per cent-component mortality and per cent—cause type were similar. In 1970 this was not the case, implying
a “cross-over effect,” that is, one type of
component mortality was caused in part
by the other mortality components cause
of death. In this case, a portion of neonatal
deaths were due to exogenous causes.
This is what likely explains the inverse
neonatal pattern and the observed widening of the overall infant mortality/
socioeconomic status differential of other
recent research (Brooks, 1975a, 1975;
Markides and Barnes, 1977; Adamchak
and Stockwell, 1978).

These trends could be due to adverse
social and economic conditions or could
indicate that medical advances have prolonged and/or are prolonging the infants’

Social Biology

lives into the second and subsequent
months (e.g., infants who would have
normally died in the neonatal period have
survived into and died in the postneonatal
period).

THE IMPACT OF SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS
ON INFANT MORTALITY

The major aspect of this study focused
on the infant mortality/socioeconomic
status relationship using correlational procedures. Zero-order correlation coefficients are provided in Table 3. A comparison of the three time periods indicates that infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality have a negative relationship with those measures that are direct indicators of status (e.g., education,
occupation, income, and single housing
units), and a positive relationship with the
remaining variables that are inverse indicators of status. Although some correlation coefficients are modest, all but three
are in the predicted direction and for the
most part are statistically significant at the
0.05 level. Most coefficients become increasingly stronger from 1950 to 1970,
thus supporting the hypothesis of a widening socioeconomic mortality differential.
The only variable that deviated from the
predicted direction was female labor force
participation. A negative association was
predicted between infant mortality and its
components and female labor force participation, but such association was found
only for total infant mortality in 1950 (not
significant) and for postneonatal mortality
in 1950 and 1960 (significant at the 0.05
level). In 1970, however, this variable was
significantly correlated in a high positive
direction with all three infant mortality
rates. Thus, contrary to expectations, it
appears that this variable has emerged as
a negative index of status; the lower the
status, the higher the percentage of females who are in the labor force which
coincides with the matriarchal family

With the exception of the crowding
variable, the relationship between socioeconomic status and mortality increased
for both total and neonatal mortality between 1950 and 1970, particularly for
neonatal mortality. For postneonatal mortality the predicted associations became
stronger during this period for all but three
variables (education, occupation, and
crowding). The most salient conclusion to
be drawn from this phase of the analysis
then, despite the few exceptions noted, is
that the genera] decline in infant mortality
in recent years has not been accompanied
by the expected narrowing of the socioeconomic differential. On the contrary,
the relationship has become more pro
nounced over the years; and the major
contributing factor to this widening differential has been the emergence of a very
pronounced inverse relationship between
the several socioeconomic variables and
the neonatal death rate.

Table 4 provides squared semipartial
correlation coefficients between infant,
neonatal, and postneonatal mortality
rates. Viewing infant mortality in 1950 indicates that when the effect of race on
education alone is removed this variable
explains nearly 7 per cent of the variance
in infant mortality (sr? = 0.069). Similarly, when the effect of race was removed
from the independent variables “unemployment” and “crowding,” they accounted for 11.8 and 14.6 per cent of the
variance in infant mortality. These three

were the only sr”’s that were statistically
significant in 1950 for total infant mortality.

In 1960, the squared semipartials were
statistically significant for high school
education, median income, unemployment, marital instability, and single housing units. Education and unemployment
declined slightly while crowding declined
from uniquely explaining 14.6 to 1 per
cent of the variance in infant mortality. In
1970, housing status variables explained
very little, while the economic and family
status variables clearly explained most.
In fact, marital instability uniquely explained 13.2 per cent of the variance in
infant mortality in 1970 (sy? = 0.132,
p < 0.001). In 1960, the largest sy?’s were
dispersed throughout the three status
types, and in 1970 both family and economic status were strong predictors. It
was clearly evident from Table 4 that socioeconomic status accounted for more
variance in infant mortality in 1960 than
in 1950 and more in 1970 than in 1960.

The bottom of Table 4 shows the multiple correlation (R) and its square (explained variance R®) for all nine variables
(eight independent variables and the control variable). R?’s for 1950, 1960, and
1970 explained 24.5, 34.0, and 65.7 per
cent of the variance in infant mortality,
respectively. The large increase from 1960
to 1970 indicates that socioeconomic status
variables became more sensitive to infant
mortality during that decade.

Table 4 shows that in 1950 and 1960 no
clear-cut status type pattern existed for
neonatal mortality. In 1950 unemployment uniquely explained the largest
amount of the variance (4.6 per cent) in
neonatal mortality, but it was not statistically significant. In 1960, single housing
units explained 7.2 per cent (sr? = 0.072,
p < 0.05). Income and unemployment
also reached the 0.05 level of significance
in 1960. In 1970 for neonatal mortality,

Social Biology

the same five variables were significant as
in total infant mortality. The family status
variable, marital instability, uniquely explained 8.4 per cent of the variance, the
highest in 1970. For each successive period, socioeconomic status had become
more sensitive to neonatal mortality. This
was also evidenced in the R*’s. In 1950,
1960, and 1970 all variables taken together explained 13.5, 29.7, and 41.8 per
cent of the variance in neonatal mortality.

Postneonatal mortality has traditionally
been very sensitive to socioeconomic
status as shown in Table 4. In 1950, all
srs except for marital instability and
single housing units were statistically significant. Education and crowding
uniquely explained 17.7 and 29.1 per cent
of the variance in postneonatal mortality,
respectively. In 1960, all sr’’s were significant, with income, female labor force
participation, and single housing units
uniquely explaining the most variance in
postneonatal mortality (s7’s = 0.152,
0.128, and 0.145, respectively).

From 1960 and 1970 all sr?’s declined,
indicating that the individual uniqueness
of each independent variable explained
less variance in postneonatal mortality.
However, the R”’s of all variables considered increased from 39.3 per cent in 1950
to 43.9 per cent in 1960, and finally to 49.2
per cent in 1970, thus explaining nearly
half of the variance in postneonatal mortality at the most recent date. The increments in the R*’s for postneonatal mortality were not as great as infant or neonatal
mortality, however, indicating that the
importance of this component’s contribution to the infant mortality/socioeconomic
status relationship had become relatively
less important.

So that we may view the relationship
between total infant mortality and socioeconomic status longitudinally, Figure 1
shows sr”’s graphically. In 1950, crowding

contribute most to infant mortality. In
1960, single housing units (housing variable) and income (economic variable)
uniquely explained the most variance in
infant mortality; and in 1970, marital instability (family variable) and income
dominated. Marital instability (family) increased most from 1950 to 1970, and
crowding (housing) had the largest decrease for the same period.

In 1970, marital instability (family variable) explained the most variance, with
income (economic variable) explaining the
next highest amount. Since family type
variables, specifically marital instability,
emerged as the dominant infant mortality
explanatory variable with income placing
second, it appeared in 1970 that differences in infant mortality were working
through the amount of degree of family

disruption. In 1960, it appeared that infant mortality differentials worked
through housing variables, and in 1950
one dominant type did not emerge which
further substantiates those assertions by
Willie, Stockwell, and others that infant
mortality was at that time not very sensitive to differences in socioeconomic status.
However, in 1960 and more so in 1970,
clear-cut patterns emerge, with family
status dominating in the most recent period and increasing explained variance of
dominant variables for all three mortality
measures.

SUMMARY, DISCUSSION AND
CONCLUSIONS

First, the correlational analysis set out
to determine if infant mortality and its

Vol. 26, No. 1

components had become more sensitive to
socioeconomic status over the three time
periods as measured by eight indicators of
socioeconomic status. Secondly, it sought
to identify the variables that contributed
most to explained variance in total infant,
neonatal, and postneonatal mortality.
Both goals were accomplished.

Although the total infant and neonatal
mortality rates declined from 1950 to 1970
in Toledo for the total and nonwhite population, and all mortality components rates
declined for the white population, it was
easily discernible that the increasing postneonatal rate for the total population
was primarily operating through the nonwhite population. It was also discernible
that socioeconomic mortality differentials
as evidenced by zero-order correlation
coefficients successively widened from
1950 to 1970, and the overall widening
differentia] resulted from an increasing
neonatal differential.

The major findings of the cause-ofdeath analysis were the “cause-period
cross-over effect,” and the changing percentage of infant deaths in each mortality
component. That is, in 1970 postneonatal
causes (exogenous) were contributing to
neonatal deaths, perhaps indicating that
the population of Toledo has experienced
adverse social and economic conditions
where infants in the neonatal period were
expiring from infectious and accidental
causes. Also interacting is the fact that a
higher percentage of infant deaths were
occurring in the postneonatal period in
1970 than in 1950 or 1960. This could
simply indicate that declining social and
economic conditions increased the per cent
in the postneonatal component, or that a
more complex mechanism is operating as
advances in medicine are prolonging the
life of the infant. Infants who normally
would have died in the first month of life
(neonatal period) may have survived into
the second and subsequent months, thus

increasing the postneonatal percentage
component.

Using squared semipartial correlation
coefficients between socioeconomic type
variables and total infant mortality as well
as its separate components identified the
socioeconomic status influence on the type
of mortality. From 1950 to 1970, total infant, neonatal, and postneonatal mortality
converge into a consistent socioeconomic
pattern. In 1950, crowding (housing variable) was the dominant variable for total
infant mortality. For neonatal mortality,
unemployment dominated, and economic
status variables and crowding (housing
variable) emerged as influencing postneonatal mortality suggesting that in 1950
the postneonatal component influenced
total infant mortality much more than
neonatal mortality.

In 1960, single housing units and income, in that order, were the dominant
variables that emerged as the most sensitive predictors for total infant mortality.

For neonatal mortality in 1960, income,
unemployment, and single housing units
dominated and for postneonatal mortality
all eight indicators were significant. This
indicates that although not perfectly consistent, both neonatal and postneonatal
mortality were beginning to coincide in
explaining the infant mortality/socioeconomic status relationship. However,
postneonatal mortality was still stronger.
This convergence was also observed in the
total R®’s which indicated that neonatal
mortaility was gaining in explained variance.

In 1970, marital instability (family
status) and income (economic status)
emerged for all three mortality rates. This
convergence was also acknowledged in
1970 with the postneonatal total R? being
only modestly higher than the R? for
neonatal mortality instead of more than
three times as large in 1950. This suggests
that in 1970, family status, and specifically

marital instability, was the most sensitive
indicator of both neonatal and _ postneonatal mortality and thus of total infant
mortality. It appears that adverse socioeconomic conditions are being manipulated through the factors that give rise to
marital disruption (widowhood and divorce). It is clear that marital disruption,
which has become so prevalent in American society, has a significant impact on
this sensitive indicator of the social and
economic well-being of a population, that
is, on the infant mortality rate. However,
marital disruption is not the only determinant of the infant mortality/socioeconomic status relationship. Income was
nearly as important as marital instability. However, marital instability had
the greatest 1950~70 increase, and in 1970
it overtook income in importance. The
underlying “cause” of the relationship (as
indicated by the importance of income)
could very well be embedded in income
differentiation. However, the sensitivity
of this differentiation is being manipulated
through factors that enhance marital instability. The fact that 38 per cent of first
marriages end in divorce in the United
States, and that the 1970 divorce rate was
equal to the high post-World War II rate,
helps to further substantiate this important phenomenon that is affecting this increasingly sensitive measure of the social
and economic conditions of this population, that is, the infant mortality rate.
For the three time periods, different
socioeconomic status variables were influencing infant mortality. Improvements in education, and improvements in
housing from 1950 to 1970 in Toledo

Social Biology

confirm the lesser role these factors are
playing in infant mortality. As new social
problems emerge, it appears that they
quickly affect sensitive indicators of wellbeing such as the infant mortality rate. In
1970, marital instability emerged as the
over-riding sensitive indicator affecting
infant mortality. Future infant mortality
research should concentrate on the familytype variables in order to better understand the dynamics of this seemingly
sensitive indicator. Longitudinal studies
are essential not only to confirm or refute
past assertions, but to place the infant
mortality/socioeconomic status relationship into a time framework in order to
enhance theoretical considerations.

Furthermore, detailed cause-of-death
analyses are needed to better understand
the mechanisms giving rise to the so-called
“cross-over effect.” The shifting periodcomponent percentage, that is, the higher
percentage of infant deaths occurring in
the postneonatal period must be examined
further so it can be determined if adverse
socioeconomic conditions or medical advances are creating this change. If the latter is the case, we could see higher postneonatal rates and postneonatal component percentages (as in this research) in the
future.
