An Estimate of the Natural Fecundability

Ratio Curve

Population Studies, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts

ABSTRACT: A curve of age-specific fecundability ratio (to the level at age 20-24) is estimated.
The rising part of the curve is estimated from Taiwanese data of the first conception delay
according to the harmonic mean method; the declining part, from Hutterite data according to a
proposed model of marital fertility rate. Heterogeneous fecundabilities and homogeneous aging
effect among women in each age group are assumed. The estimated declining path of fecundability is found to be different from that of the fertility rate.

Fecundability as a fundamental determinant of fertility has been the subject of
considerable research in the last two decades. Because of the complexity of the
reproduction process and associated data
problems, the results of fecundability estimates based on various models have not
been very specific. We know only that a
woman’s fecundability starts from a low
level at menarche, increases to a maximum level in the first half of her twenties,
and then begins to decline at some point
until it reaches zero again some time before menopause. We have not yet seen an
empirically estimated age-specific curve
representing the whole cycle of this rise
and fall of fecundability for any human

_ group. The need for such specific infor
mation is increasing, partially because of
advances in the area of family planning,
particularly in the area of simulation
modeling. In this paper, we take a step
toward fulfilling this need by estimating
and constructing a composite cycle of the
age-specific relative change of fecundabil
ity.
THE PROBLEM

Fecundability is conceptually defined
as the probability that a fertile married

woman, using no contraception, will conceive in a menstrual cycle. The time unit
is usually replaced by a calendar month
in constructing models. The various modeling approaches differ in relating this
probability to different reported events:
monthly proportion of conception, conception delays,! intervals between live
births, number of children, etc. (for survey and methodological criticisms, see
Holmberg, 1970, and Menken, 1975).
Since data on an individual woman are
hardly adequate for any statistical estimation of her monthly probability of conception, the use of models for learning about
the change of fecundability with age has
always been by estimating the mean
fecundability of a group of women. The
key questions are whether the group is
age-specific and whether women in the
group are assumed to have identical
fecundability.

An assumption of identical fecundability within a group drastically simplifies a
model but is not theoretically sound. As
will be shown, the bias in an estimate

1 Conception delay is the time length between the
beginning of a susceptible (fecundable, exposure,
risk) period and a conception. Measured in discrete
months, the conception delay months is one month
more than the susceptible months as the first includes
the month of conception while the second does not.

based on this assumption is considerable.
Hence, models have been developed
based on a certain distribution of fecundability among women, The most elegant
model seems to be the one that explains
the distribution of the first conception
delay (from marriage to conception) in
terms of a beta distribution of fecundability among women. From a sample mean
and a sample variance of the first conception delay, the two parameters of beta
distribution can be solved and an empirical test of the model follows easily (see
Henry, 19616; Potter and Parker, 1964;
Jain, 1969a; Majumdar and Sheps, 1970;
Suchindran and Lachenbuch, 1975). Beta
function is indeed a very general distribution function of a random variable taking
value between 0.0 and 1.0 and is therefore suitable for representing the variation of fecundability among women.

The reason that its application is limited to the first conception delay is that
only this period provides reliable data, in
the sense that the marriage month is both
easily identifiable and a natural starting
point of a susceptible period if no contraception is practiced. Scenarios after the
first conception are complicated. There
are many outcomes of a conception (early
fetal waste, miscarriage and _ stillbirth,
abortion, live birth) with each one being
followed by a different random length of
post-partum nonsusceptible period which
is difficult to identify.

Our interest is in the relative change of
fecundability. For an individual woman,
her expected conception delay is the inverse of her fecundability. If we have the
statistics of the sample mean of conception delay for each age-specific group,
what can we infer? It is obvious that if
within an age group every woman has
identical fecundability, then the inverse
of the sample mean is an unbiased estimate of the fecundability. But when there
is a variation of individual fecundability

Natural Fecundability

211

within an age group, which is always the
case, then it can be shown that the inverse of the sample mean of conception
delay is an unbiased estimate of the harmonic mean of the fecundabilities, not the
arithmetic mean of the fecundabilities in
the group. However, assuming homogeneous aging effect among women, the
ratio of age-specific harmonic mean
fecundabilities equals the ratio of arithmetic means. Therefore, without a model
evoking many assumptions about the distribution of fecundability within each age
group, one does know the ratios of mean
fecundability among age-specific groups if
the.mean conception delay of each group
is available, even if one does not know
the absolute level of mean fecundability
of age-specific groups. The problem is,
again, that while the data of first conception delay associated with marriage are
reliable, this type of data is only available
for a very limited number of age groups,
since the number of women married after
age 25 decreases rapidly.

In short, in constructing a complete
curve of the relative changes of fecundability with age, one may first search for
data that provide most age-specific means
of the first conception delay. After that, a
model has to be devised to estimate the
relative changes in those age groups not
covered by the data of the first conception
delay. The model should relate the distribution of fecundability in each age
group with certain other observable
events on which data are readily available.

In the next section we show that the
age-specific means of the first conception
delay as reported by Jain (19692) can easily be utilized to construct the rising part
of a composite curve of age-specific
fecundability ratio. The following section
represents our effort to formulate a model
to estimate the age-specific fecundability
ratio based on the age-specific marital ferDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

tility rate (ASMFR). With certain
simplifying assumptions, we make the
model operative and apply it to Hutterite
data? to estimate the declining part of the
composite curve. We present the curve as
a first approximation of the human
fecundability cycle.

2 The Hutterites are a Protestant sect living in the
Dakotas, Montana, and the adjacent portions of
Canada in small agricultural settlements. The sect
originated in Switzerland in 1528, and the ancestors
of the American Hutterites came to this country in
the 1870’s. Not only is the practice of contraception
condemned by Hutterite religion and custom, but the
communal structure of the settlements removes any
economic incentive toward family limitation. As a
result, their number has increased fram 443 in 1880
to more than 8,500 in 1950 (Tietze, 1957), which is to
say that the sect has increased over 19 times its size in
a period of 70 years. The birth rate of the Hutterites
is the highest on record, while the death rate corresponds to that of the general population of the United
States. Finally, in contrast to other groups where
there is little migration, where no birth control measures are used, and where reproduction proceeds
without conscious planning, Hutterite vital statistics
are unusually reliable (Eaton and Mayer, 1954).

The purpose of this paper is to estimate

show that q; can, on the basis of one assumption, be estimated from the data M,
and M., and we then use the published
data of Taiwanese women (Jain 1969a) to
estimate g,; for ¢ = 16, 17, 18, 19. The
relation between the sample mean conception delay and the harmonic mean fecundability is well known (Sheps and Menken, 1973, pp. 108-112), but it has not
been empirically utilized, perhaps because
past interest has always been in the absolute level of fecundability (p,), which cannot be estimated by the harmonic mean
method, rather than in the ratio of fecundability (q,).

Our assumption is

Pi = Re Pri, (1)

that is, each woman has an identical
age-specific coefficient &, that represents
her fecundability at ¢ as a fraction of her
fecundability of age 20 to-24, which varies
from woman to woman. From (1) and
from the definitions of arithmetic mean
and of our q,, it follows that q, = R.
Hence, we write

Pu = Qt Pxi- (2)

Substituting (2) into the definition of
harmonic mean,

THE RELATIVE CHANGE IN
FECUNDABILITY OF HUTTERITE
WOMEN

Since the data of v,; after the first conception is scarce and unreliable, we abandon the simple ratio method and propose
in this section a model for the purpose of
estimating g, fort > 24. The formulation
of the model starts from relating the expected live births by a woman per year to
the expected time interval between her
two conceptions. This part, which is similar to the model proposed by Henry
(1961a) and Perrin and Sheps (1964), is
simple. This micromodel can be aggregated to a macromodel of age-specific marital fertility rate (ASMFR), the data of
which is more reliable, by integrating the
joint distribution of individual women’s
reproduction characteristics. To make the
integration operative and applicable to
Hutterite data, which is still the best published data known to us, we use certain
assumptions to limit the distributed
characteristics to fecundability and nonsusceptible (unfecundable) time length
after alive birth only. Further, we assume
Equation (1) and that p+; has a beta distribution. Then the remaining task is to
solve for g,; in the model from all known
parameters and variables without knowing the specific distribution of the nonsusceptible time after a live birth. We devise
a technique for this task and prove the
mathematical inequality that is its basis.

For clarity of presentation, in this section we only show the model, the procedure of application, and the result of applying the model to the Hutterite data.

from the Hutterite data and other sources,
and the justification of certain assumptions are shown in appendices.

First, we define additional symbols to
be used in this section and in the appendices. Since we are dealing with agespecific cross-sectional data, the subscript
t used in the last section will in most cases
be suppressed in this section (q; and p,;, for
example, become g and p;). The term
“woman” in the definitions below not only
has the same restrictive meaning as in the
definitions in the last section but also refers to the one not inducing abortion. Our
symbols and definitions are:

F,; Expected number of births per year

for a woman 7.

F Age-specific marital fertility rate
(ASMFR).

k Pregnancy outcome: k = 1, live birth;
k = 2, early fetal death (pregnancy
terminated less than 28 weeks after
conception by a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion); k = 3, late fetal
death (pregnancy terminated 28
weeks or later after conception, including stillbirths).

@;; Conditional probability of pregnancy
outcome k for a woman 27.

Q,; Unconditional probability of pregnancy outcome k for a woman 7.

Notice that
Qi: = (1 — da)(1 — yi);
Qo: = dais (8)

V, Expected susceptible months (before
the conception month) for a woman 2.

Age-specific proportion of naturally

sterile women.

3 Fetal deaths are divided between early and late
fetal deaths because the distribution of the frequency
of fetal deaths by duration of pregnancy is bimodal.

(9)

The denominator is the expected months
between two conceptions. If every conception leads to a live birth, then the expected
number of births per month is simply the
inverse of the denominator. This quantity
is then adjusted by the probability of live
birth Q,; and multiplied by 12 to yield the
expected births per year.

Since 1/p; is the expected months-ofconception delay (including the month of
conception), V; (excluding the month of
conception) is 1/p; — 1. Substituting this
into (9) gives the fertility model for an
individual woman:

F, = 12 Ou (10)

k

This equation is the same as that in the
asymptotic model derived by Perrin and
Sheps (1964) who gave more detailed
analyses and discussed the assumptions.
There are six i-specific parameters in the
equation: ¢o;, $31, Ui, U2, Usi, and pj.
Integrating their joint distribution would
yield the aggregate ASMFR. But there is
little hope of knowing such a joint distribution.

To make the aggregation still possible,
we assume:

@) Qu = Qi
(tz) Q2Ue; + QsiU3i = Q2U2 + Q3U3.

These assumptions are slightly weaker
than the assumptions of constancy in each
individual variable (i.e., do: = do, 3;
=¢3, Ux, = U2, U3; = U3). They are
sufficient for us to concentrate on the distributions of p; and U,; only. This is consistent with the large fecundability variance estimates in previous work (Bongaarts, 1975; Holmberg, 1972) and with

 

 
Vol. 25, No. 3

our empirical knowledge about the significant variation in U,; (Appendix B).
Furthermore we assume:

(177) p; = qpx; and ps; has a beta distribution among women;

(iv) U,, and ps; are independently
distributed among women.

Assumption (ii7) follows (1) in the last sec
tion, and that beta distribution is, as men
tioned, a very general distribution of
‘0 probability. Assumption (?v) may be jus& tified by the lack of counter-evidence and
© by our conjecture that the determinants of
p+; and U,; are quite different. (One major
determinant of U,,; is the extent of breast
feeding, a behavioristic variable which
can be regarded as independent of biological and social determinants of px.)

These assumptions allow us to reach the

= We estimated these two parameters from
A Taiwanese data provided by Jain (19692)
and apply them to the Hutterites. On the
other hand, we have no knowledge about
dh,. Because of this, we propose the following method by which g in (11) can be
solved for.

* As reported by Potter and Parker (1964), among
others, estimates a and b of the parameters of the

Let g(x) be defined as the following function of a variable x:

and let U,;™", U,™8*, U respectively be the

in the considered sample. We prove in
Appendix A that

Flow = gj) (12)
Fup = ¢ g(U,™") + (1 — c) g(U1™*) (13)

in which F!°’ and F"°? denote the lower
and upper bound of F respectively and c is
the solution to the following condition:

c Uy™" + (1 — c)U,™* = Uy. (14)

The basis for this relation is as follows.
Let x be a continuous variable defined in
the interval (4,B) wih O <A =B so,
Then it,can be proved (Appendix-A) that
the following two inequalities hold for any
density distribution dh(x):

1

with x = [. x dh(x) and c being the solu
tion tocA + (1 —c)B=x.

The ASMFR can be equated to a linear
combination of its lower and upper
bounds:

F =w Fe* + (1 — w)FYPP, (15)

Notice that F!’ and F¥"?, and therefore
F, are a function of g. But for the women
in age group 20-24, q has been defined as
1.0. Therefore, the application of Equations (11) through (15) to the data of
women in this age group provides the solution for the only known weight w.

Now with one additional assumption

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

216

that w is constant across age groups, we
insert the solved w back into Equations
(11) through (15) and are able to solve for
gq from each age-specific cross-sectional
data.

Applying this technique to the Hutterite
data, we obtain g, fort = 25,... , 47.
The data used and the evaluations of various variables and parameters are detailed
in Appendix B. A special method, the
smoothed isotonic regression, that is used
in evaluating F is explained in Appendix
C. The result of our estimation of gq, is
presented in Table 2.

We combine our results from Table 1
and Table 2 to construct a composite
curve of fecundability ratio in Figure 1.
Finally, we also compute the age-specific
fertility ratios of Hutterite women (from
data in Table B.1, Appendix B, with the
average ASMFR of 20-24 years old as the
basis*) and plot them in Figure 1 for comparison.

° The average ASMFR of Hutterites 20-24 years
old is 56.7 per 100 women. It was computed from
data reported by Sheps (1965, Table 2, p. 68).

different sociocultural backgrounds. The
models are built upon assumptions, and
the plausibility of some of these assumptions is difficult to assess. Considering
these, one should certainly be careful about
the generality and precision of the curve.
On the generality side, however, one
should not be too conservative to accept
the cross-cultural composite approach.
Fecundability is the result of the interaction of a woman’s biological capacity to
conceive and social factors such as coital
frequency. It is true that cultural differences will likely cause differences in the
o fecundability level, given the same biologA ical capacity. But on the relative change of
oo fecundability over ages, the effect of such
t~ social factors is much lessened, unless we
cs have evidence that, for example, the dis‘= tribution of marital coital frequency over
= ages is different among different ethnic
& groups. Before we have more comparative
5 studies, we can tentatively view the curve
= in Figure 1 as a first approximation to the
‘6 rise and decline of human fecundability.
The degree of approximation is probably less precise on the declining part of the
curve, as the ASMFR model evokes more
assumptions than does the simple harmonic mean method. With this qualifica> tion, we may nevertheless, in the light of
= the general trend shown in the curve, take
g the new view (1) that a woman’s fecunda©
a

cember 2015

bility declines immediately after the first
half of her twenties and (2) that the decline
is approximately linear all the way to the
zero level near her menopause. In the
past, most researchers believed or assumed that a woman’s fecundability stays
at a maximum level until she is 30 or still
older and that the decline occurs slowly
first and then gradually accelerates (Henry
19616, Vincent 1961, Henry, 1965; Jacquard, 1967; Ridley and Sheps, 1966; Barrett and Brass, 1974; Holmberg, 1972).
This view is probably based on certain
observed decline paths of the ASMFR. In

 

Natural Fecundability

 

217

Figure 1, the Hutterite ASMFR indeed
declines in a way different from the
straight-line tendency of the fecundability
ratio. From age 24 to age 30, for example,

-ASMFR declines by 8 per cent while

fecundability has already declined by 17
per cent. The fast decline of ASMFR does
not occur until somewhere near the age of
38 when fecundability is already half of its
maximum level.

To explain the disparity between the
two paths of decline, one may examine the
data used in Appendix B. Since U2, Us,
umn Uy™x, U, and the weight w are all
assumed to be constant over age t, the
factors that cause the disparity must come
from the changes in pregnancy-outcome
probabilities and the change in the proportion of sterile women with age. Indeed, in
our estimation, both the early and late
fetal death probability @, and @, increase
with age and so does the proportion of
sterile women s (see Table B.3 and Table
B.7). The reasons for their increase are
discussed in the appendix.

If one views fecundability as the product of a woman’s biological capacity to
conceive (potential) and her actual coital
frequency, then it should be pointed out
that a linear decline of her fecundability
does not necessarily imply a linear decline
of her biological capacity to conceive. It
can be shown that the path of the biological capacity decline must be above the
path of fecundability decline if marital coital frequency in fact decreases over age.
On the other hand, if one views coital
frequency and factors other than the biological capacity as only minor determinants of fecundability, then a linear decline
of fecundability reflects a linear decline of
biological capacity to conceive. In the future, after we become more certain about
the relative changes in both fecundability
and coital frequency over age as well as
the latter’s role in determining the former,
we may infer more definitively the changes

in women’s purely biological capacity to
conceive. .

Beside the curve of fecundability ratio,
there are two minor points associated with
our estimate that may be worth mentioning. Our estimate simultaneously allows
heterogeneity of fecundability in each age
group and the aging effect over age group.
This has not been done before in estimating fecundability or testing related hypotheses, although the need to do so is
reflected in certain simulation models
(e.g., Lachenbruch et al., 1973; Barrett
and Brass, 1974; Bongaarts, 1977). The
need for allowing both variations is illustrated next.

HOMOGENEOUS AND HETEROGENEOUS
FECUNDABILITY

What is the effect of the assumption of
homogeneous fecundability in each age
group—the assumption that allows the inverse of sample (arithmetic) mean of first
conception delay to be the estimated
fecundability (e.g., Potter, 1972a,b)P As
an example, let us look at the 20-24 age
group of the Taiwanese sample. The sample mean of first conception delay is 6.57
months (see Table 1). Hence the estimated
fecundability would be 1/6.57 = 0.152,
according to the homogeneity assumption.
But a beta distribution of fecundability in
this age group has the parameters a =
3.24 and B = 12.5, as calibrated from the
sample mean and sample variance of first
conception delay by Jain (1969a). Thus,
the mean fecundability of this age group
is, according to the beta distribution
model, a/(a + 8) = 0.206. If the model is
correct, the estimate according to the homogeneity assumption has a bias of (0.152
— 0,206)/0.206 = —26.2 per cent.

The need for considering the agespecific change in fecundability is more
obvious. In Figure 1, fecundability has

 

Bendel and Hua

almost doubled in the short span between
age 16 and age 20-24, with each year having a distinctly different ratio. Besides
being important information itself, these
ratios may refine our research. If two
samples of young women are known to
have different age distributions, then the
expected ratio of mean fecundability can
now be computed. Without taking this
portion into account, an estimated difference in mean fecundability between two
samples may be attributed to another effect improperly or inconclusively.

For example, Jain (1969c) estimated the
mean fecundability at marriage for two
groups of Taiwanese women. At the time
of interview, one group used contraception, and the other did not. He found a
higher mean fecundability in the first
group and therefore supported the hypothesis proposed by Freedman and
Takeshita (1969) that contraception users
have higher natural fecundability than
nonusers. However, considering that the
use of contraception is positively correlated with educational level (Taiwan Provincial Health Department, 1972, p. 40)
and that educational level is positively
correlated with age at marriage in Taiwan
(Hermalin, 1973, p. 32), one may infer
that certain portions of the higher mean
fecundability in the first group can be attributed to the age effect. Hence the hypothesis cannot be tested unless the age effect is
controlled. Jain’s data permits one to test
the hypothesis for each age group separately.

A more efficient test can be done by
pooling data into the contraception user
group and the nonuser group, as Jain did,
but computing the expected ratio of mean
fecundability between the two groups as
the null hypothesis. The expected ratio is
obtainable from weighting the estimated
age-specific fecundability ratios by the age
distribution of each group.

DATA USED IN ESTIMATING THE RELATIVE
CHANGE IN FECUNDABILITY OF HUTTERITES

(a) Age-specific marital fertility rate F.
The basic data are age-specific fertility
rates classified by age at marriage for

 

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

220 Bendel and Hua

Hutterite women cited in Sheps (1965, p.
68). The rates are tabulated by single years
of age. The women are further divided
into four age-at-marriage groups: less than
20, 20-24, 25-29, and 30 years or more.

Only the fraction of the year of age
when a woman was married was included
in calculating these rates. Because of the
method used, the rate in the first year of
each age-at-marriage group was lower
than for subsequent years. For example, a
woman married at 20.5 years contributed
six months to the denominator for the
twenty-first year, although she was very
unlikely to contribute a birth, since premarital conceptions are virtually nonexistent for the Hutterites. To avoid this problem, only marital fertility rates of women
who had been married for at least two
years were used.

Furthermore, the cyclic tendency of annual birth rates by year of marriage, predicted theoretically by Perrin and Sheps
(1964, p. 28) has been observed empirically (Sheps, 1965, p. 69). This cycle effect

_ will appear in ASMFR classified by age at

marriage unless the age at marriage is distributed uniformly among each age-atmarriage group. This is not the case for
the Hutterites (Eaton and Mayer, 1954, p.
16), and indeed two- or three-year cycles
can be observed:in Sheps’s ASMFR data.

To correct for this cycle effect in Sheps’s
data and to take into account the
monotonic decrease of natural fecundability with age from maximum fecundability
to zero at the age of menopause, the
smoothed isotonic regression is applied to
the reported data of ASMFR to obtain a
set of corrected value of F. The method of
smoothed isotonic regression is described
in Appendix C. The originally reported
data and the corrected F are listed in

ability among women of the duration of

death and late fetal death, as well as the
subsequent post-partum anovulatory period, one can assume that women are relatively homogeneous with respect to a nonsusceptibility period associated with an
early fetal death of four months (three
months of pregnancy and one month of
post-partum anovulatory period), as well
as to a nonsusceptibility period associated
with a late fetal death of eleven months
(eight months of pregnancy and three
months of post-partum anovulatory period). The same, however, cannot be said
for the nonsusceptible period associated
with a live birth because of the wide variation of breast-feeding behavior among
women, expecially in developing countries, and its effect on the post-partum
nonsusceptibility period (Berman et al.,
1972; Ginsberg, 1973; Van Ginneken,
1974).

(c) Minimum and maximum duration of

a live birth, U,™™" and U,™*. The duration of pregnancy resulting in a live birth
is nine months. Furthermore, it is rare for
ovulation to occur before day forty after
childbirth (Perez et al., 1971). Therefore,
ten months is a reasonable estimate for the
minimum duration of the nonsusceptibility period U, associated with a live birth.
Different studies have shown that less
than 4 per cent of women who had weaned
their child during the first six months folwlowing birth were still in post-partum
Samenorrhea twelve months after delivery
(Jain et al., 1970, p. 261). Combining that

The reported mean interval between the

less than 25 years of age at marriage and

months (Sheps, 1965, p. 74). Since very
few of these women married before the age
of 20, and less than 10 per cent of these
women had not had their first child within
two years of marriage (Sheps, 1965), most
of the secona children were conceived
when fecundability was maximum (20-24

years of age). Thus, g = 1.0 for this sample of Hutterite women, and the mean
duration U, of the nonsusceptibility associated with a live birth for this group of
Hutterite women can be estimated from
the following equation:

}

18.2 =U, + | dh.(px),
where dhx is the density distribution of
maximum natural fecundability described
previously.

Assuming that dh. is a beta distribution
and adopting the parameters estimated by
Majumdar and Sheps (1970), we find UV, to
be 13.4 months (which corresponds to 4.4
months of post-partum nonsusceptible period).

(e) Conditional probability of early and
late fetal deaths, dg and od, by maternal age
at conception. Specific data on pregnancy
termination rates for Hutterites are unavailable to the authors. However, the
health condition of the Hutterites as indicated by their death rate is comparable to
that in the United States in general
(Eaton and Mayer, 1954, pp. 32-33;
Tietze, 1957, pp. 89-90). Thus, the probabilities of early fetal death (conditional to
a pregnancy of 28 weeks or less) will be
estimated from other studies on pregnancy
termination among populations comparable to that of the United States in the
fifties, since Hutterite data on ASMFR relate to births, most of which occurred in
the fifties (Mange, 1964, p. 104, cited in
Sheps, 1965, p. 65).

(1) Early fetal deaths, d,: The best study
on the estimation of the probability of
early fetal death is that of French and
Bierman (1962) called the Kauai Pregnancy Study (KPS). The KPS consists of
the follow-up of 3,197 pregnancies on the
island of Kauai during the four-year period 1953-56. The study was designed to
provide information about early pregnancies from four week’s gestation onward,

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

222 Bendel and Hua

that is, reports of pregnancy from the
women themselves as soon as they suspected they were pregnant. The population of this Hawaiian island is comparable
to the white population in the United
States in terms of life expectancy at birth,
infant mortality, and birth rates (French
and Bierman, 1962, p. 836). Probabilities
of fetal losses by gestational age were
computed by the life-table method (French
and Bierman, 1962, p. 840). We computed
the conditional probability of early fetal
death (gestational age of less than 28
weeks) to be 0.224. Unfortunately, the
data were not provided for specific maternal age at conception. For that reason, we
have to turn to the other major study on
pregnancy outcome, that of Shapiro et al.
(1962).

Shapiro et al. (1962) investigated 6,844
pregnancy terminations among women
whose last menstrual period prior to pregnancy began during the interval between
March, 1958, and February, 1959, and
who received care from the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York (HIP)
obstetricians in medical groups located in
New York City. Fetal deaths were computed by gestational age and maternal age
at conception per 1,000 pregnancies at risk
(Shapiro et al., 1962, p. 16). From the life
table of pregnancy termination (Shapiro et
al., 1962, p. 43), we computed the conditional probability of early fetal death (gestational age of less than 28 weeks) for all
maternal ages as being 0.133. For gestational age of less than 20 weeks, it is 0.125.

The data provided by Shapiro et al.
(1962, p. 16) only allow computation of the
conditional probability of early fetal death
by maternal age directly for gestational
age of less than 20 weeks. Let us assume
the same difference between conditional
probability of early fetal death of gestational ages of less than 28 weeks and of
less than 20 weeks for all maternal age at
conception (that is, 0.133 — 0.125 =

Social Biology

0.008). Then we can estimate the conditional probability of early fetal deaths of
gestational age of less than 28 weeks by
adding 0.008 to the conditional probability
of early fetal deaths of gestational age of
less than 20 weeks.

However, Shapiro et al. (1962, p. 13)
recognized that the observed probability
of pregnancy termination in the early
weeks of gestation was too low, resulting
in underestimating the conditional probability of early fetal loss. We assumed that
the true incidence of pregnancy termination was equal to the more complete Kauai
Pregnancy Study (in terms of detection of
early pregnancy losses), and that the same
underestimation occurred for all maternal
ages at conception. Therefore, the conditional probability of early fetal death computed from Shapiro was increased by
0.011, which is equal to the difference between the conditional probability of early
fetal death in the KPS (0.224) and the
conditional probability of early fetal death
in the study by Shapiro et al. (0.133), unconditional to maternal] age at conception.

After all these adjustments were made,
we obtained the conditional probability of
early fetal death for gestational age of less
than 28 weeks shown in Table B.2.

While the increase of fetal death rate
(also found in Erhardt and Jacolizner,
1956; Yerushalmy et al., 1956; Warburton
and Fraser, 1964; Jain, 1969b) is typically
interpreted as resulting from a progressive
deterioration of the ability of individual
women to bear children successfully (Fischler et al., 1971), Resseguie (1974) offers
 

Vol. 25, No. 3

an alternative explanation. He suggests a
large fraction of fetal death is experienced
by a small number of women prone to fetal
loss. These women constitute a small fraction of those pregnant at ages when most
women in their particular society are bearing children, but progressively greater
fractions in those age classes in which
. births are less common. A major factor
contributing to the sharp increase in loss
rates during a woman’s thirties is the deci— sion by most women resistant to fetal loss
oS . .
“to cease bearing children because they
6 have as many as they desire, while a disE proportionate fraction of women prone to
® fetal loss continue to become pregnant.
« This hypothesis leads to the conclusion
< that a society in which healthy women
<; generally want large numbers of children
= and do not marry unusually young should
—exhibit a slower rate of increase in fetal
S)death ratio with age of mother than does
rs the general United States population. This
‘S hypothesis was successfully tested on the
‘o Amish by Resseguie (1974), who also suggested that the same findings would hold
< true for the Hutterites (Resseguie, 1974, p.
5 637). For this reason, we chose a slower
rate of increase with age for the paramaeters of conditional probability of early
3 fetal loss for Hutterites (¢.) than we did
3 for the Shapiro sample (Table B.2). There"= fore, the parameters used in estimating the
= ASMFR among Hutterites are those listed
Fin Table B.3. Furthermore, the conditional probability of early fetal death is
assumed to increase linearly with age between each mid-age interval.
(2) Late fetal death, ¢,: Table B.4 de
Natural Fecundability

notes late fetal death in the United States
per 1,000 pregnancies with gestational age
of either 20 weeks and more or 28 weeks
and more. Based on these data, Table B.5
lists the conditional probabilities of late
fetal death (gestational age of 28 weeks or
more) by maternal age for application to
the Hutterite sample. Again, the conditional probability of late fetal loss is assumed to increase linearly with age between each mid-age interval.

(f) Distribution of maximum natural
fecundability, dh,. The most direct
method of estimating the parameters of
the beta distribution of maximum fecundability is through a model based on first
pregnancy such as the one proposed by
Potter and Parker (1964). Indeed, the latter have shown that if M and V are respectively the mean and variance of elapsed
time from marriage to first pregnancy
among a population of married women,
then the parameters (a,b) of the beta distribution of fecundability among this population can be estimated by

a= 2V
— V-MP+M
b= (M — 1I)@ - 1).

Thus, the data required to estimate the
parameters of the beta distribution of maximum fecundability are the timing of the
first pregnancy of women who did not use
contraception before the first conception
and who were 20-24 years of age at marriage.

The only such published data available
is Jain’s sample of Taiwanese women
(1969a). The Taiwanese sample is a prob

abilistic sample of married women, of
which 3 per cent have been excluded because they had not conceived by the time
of the survey. According to historical data
relating to populations practicing little or
no birth control, the sterility rate for
women aged 20 is also in the vicinity of 3
per cent (Henry, 19615, p. 85). Therefore,
the number of fecund women excluded
from the sample can be considered negligible. If that were not the case, the sample
might have been biased due to the exclusion of women with presumably low
fecundability (since they had not conceived by the time of the interview). Thus,
the Taiwanese sample might be considered representative of the fecund married
female population in Taiwan.

The data consist of the mean and variance of elapsed time to first pregnancy by
single year of age at marriage from age 20
to 24, as well as the sample size in each age
group (Jain, 1969a, p. 79). From these
data, the mean M and variance V of
elapsed time to first conception for women
married between ages 20 and 24 are computed, resulting in M@ = 6.57 months, and
V = 95.44. Thus, we can estimate the

parameters of the beta distribution of maximum fecundability: @ = 3.24, and B =
12.50.

The parameters of the beta distribution
of maximum natural fecundability among
fecund married women are assumed to
vary little over time and among cultures.
Therefore, the estimated (a = 3.24 and B
= 12.50) derived previously from
Taiwanese data are applied to the Hutterites.

In empirical applications using a computer, the continuous beta function is replaced by a discrete frequency distribution
defined for 0.01 increments between 0 and
1. The relative frequency of such variable
x is computed by the difference [(X +
0.005, a,B8) — I(X ~— 0.005, a,8) where

SMOOTHED ISOTONIC REGRESSION

(a) Isotonic regression over a simply ordered set. The following definition is derived from Barlow et al. (1972, pp. 9-18).
Let X be the finite set (x,,.. . , x,) with
the simple order x, <x. <...<x,.A
real valued function f on X is isotonic if x,
y eX andx <yimply/(x) = f(y). (The term
“nondecreasing” would serve equally
well.) Let g be a given function onX andw
a given positive function on X. An isotonic
function g* on X is an isotonic regression
of g with weights w with respect to the
simple ordering x, <<%).<...<<X, if it
minimizes in the class of isotonic functions
fon X the sum

L[g(x) — flx)P w(x).

More simply, g* is the isotonic regression of g.

In other words, an isotonic regression g*
of a real valued function g is the closest
nondecreasing approximation (in terms of
sum of squared errors) to the function g.
Such isotonic regression can be computed,
using the “pool-adjacent violators” algorithm described in Barlow et.al. (1972,
pp. 9-18).

(b) Smoothed isotonic regression. To
transform a nondecreasing isotonic regression computed by the _ pool-adjacentviolator algorithm into a monotonic increasing function, we defined a new function g** which we call smoothed isotonic
regression. The values are computed as
follows: the value of g** is equal to that of
g* for all elements which have not been
pooled, and the value of g** associated
with an element which has been pooled is
equal to the mean of the value of g* associated with the same element and the
value of g* associated with the two adjacent elements:

g**, = g*, if element 7 has not been
pooled;

g**, = 1/3 g*_1 + 9%; + 2% i41)
