ABSTRACT: Drawing upon data from the 1965 National Fertility Study, this paper attempts to
categorize white wives by their form of childlessness. Three categories of childlessness emerge:
Voluntary, Involuntary, and Temporary. The three types of childless wives are compared across
a number of demographic, socioeconomic, marital, and religious characteristics. The Voluntarily
and Involuntarily Childless wives are remarkably similar on most characteristics, and they differ

significantly from the Temporarily Childless.

Childlessness is a phenomenon that has
received limited attention in recent years
by demographers and sociologists. Of
the analyses conducted, most focus on
childlessness as if it only occurred involuntarily. The state of childlessness, however,
need not always be the result of involuntary factors. In some instances, it may well
be the consequence of a voluntary decision
between a wife and husband.

Empirically, we know very little about
voluntary and involuntary childlessness.
A few studies have attempted to identify
the childless population in terms of its voluntary and involuntary components, but
none have compared these subpopulations
with respect to social, demographic, and
other characteristics. This paper is an attempt to fill that void. My principal objective is to identify the voluntarily and involuntarily childless and then to compare
the subgroups with each other on a number of socioeconomic, marital, and religious characteristics. The data for this
study are drawn from the 1965 National
Fertility Study.

EARLIER STUDIES

The bulk of the research on childlessness has tended to treat the phenomenon

as if it only occurs involuntarily. Only a
few researchers allow for the possibility
that some couples will decide voluntarily
to be child-free (e.g., Kiser, 1939; Pohlman, 1970; Veevers, 1971la, 1971b, 1972,
1973, 1974; Gustavus and Henley, 1971;
Poston, 1974). The modest attention given
to the possibility of voluntary childlessness
may result in part from the general lack of
approval afforded childlessness by the society at large. The norms relating to marriage and procreation in our society are
pervasive and pronatalist. Married persons are expected to have children, should
want to have children, and should rejoice
at the prospect of having children (Veevers, 1974, p. 306). Childlessness is neither
supported nor encouraged by the society’s
normative and value structure. Such a
proscription is understandable in a sense,
because a total and complete incidence of
the phenomenon would obviously be dysfunctional for the society’s replacement
and ultimate survival (Poston, 1974, p.
297). The childed state is thus valued in its
own right (Griffith, 1973), and those who
remain without children experience severe
negative sanctions (Veevers, 1973; Blake,
1974, especially pp. 36—37).

Some marriage and family-life scholars

198

Vol. 23, No. 3 Voluntarily and Involuntarily Childless Wives

have been inclined to view childlessness
in light of these normative proscriptions.
They have concluded almost as a matter of
fact that few couples will choose to be
without children. Martinson (1970, p. 314)
notes that “the desire for children is nearly
universal. Marriages childless by choice
are practically nonexistent.” Similarly,
Bell (1971, p. 417) has observed that “the
majority of childless couples are not that
way by choice.” In discussions of the attention given childlessness in recent family
textbooks by Kephart (1966), Landis and
Landis (1968), and Landis (1970), Veevers
(1974, p. 306) noted that “an estimate of
the incidence of childlessness is followed
by a discussion of factors contributing to
subfecundity and sterility, revealing an
implicit assumption that fecundity problems are the only cause of childlessness,
and that something should be done to help
the childless couple.”

Empirical data and estimates, however,
do not support the suggested universality
of involuntary childlessness. In Kiser’s
study of New York City conducted in the
late 1930’s, he observed that although the
major share of permanent childlessness
“appeared to be largely an involuntary
situation,” some of the childlessness was
likely not due to involuntary sterility and
subfecundity (Kiser, 1939, pp. 66-68).
More recently, Veevers (1972) has evaluated the incidence of voluntary childlessness in Canada and has estimated that at
least half of the childlessness occurring
there among urban women 45 years of age
and older may well have been voluntary.
A similar conclusion was reached by Rao
(1974) in an analysis of fertility data collected from Rhode Island women during
the late 1960’s. He estimated that among
the childless women aged 30 to 49 living
with their husbands, half of them are voluntarily childless.

In still another study, Waller et al.
(1973) suggested that families without

199

children were comprised of couples who
were biologically fertile and couples who
were biologically or deliberately sterile.
While the authors did not employ a
voluntary-involuntary dichotomy in their
conceptualization of childlessness, they
were successful in demonstrating that
childlessness is not solely the result of involuntary factors.

In addition, many are arguing that the
1960’s have been a decade of change with
respect to contraceptive technology, sexual and family norms, and female work
patterns and preferences (Bumpass, 1973;
Westoff, 1972; Presser and Bumpass,
1972; Jones and Westoff, 1972). It is
claimed that these changes are beginning
to make possible the eventual realization
of equal opportunity between the sexes because nonfamilial roles for females are
now becoming a realistic option. Bumpass
(1973, p. 68) has written:

The potential for complete fertility control
makes childbearing—when and if—a matter
of choice in an ultimate sense that never
before existed. For the first time motherhood
itself is fully a matter for rational evaluation.
Since it. . . (no longer must) be rationalized
because inevitable, costs as well as virtues
must be weighed. . . . Obviously childbearing roles offer much that is rewarding, but
these rewards are not likely to be experienced equally by all women. . . . Motherhood (has thus been placed) more squarely in
competition with other social roles.

If the above arguments are true, they
point to the increasing importance of voluntary childlessness. Further, given the
earlier data and estimates concerning its
incidence, it would appear that the phenomenon should be given more attention
in demographic and social scientific research. However, except for two analyses
by Gustavus and Henley (1971) and by
Veevers (1974) to be discussed below, we
know little about the characteristics of
the voluntarily childless and the extent to

200

which they are similar to or different from
the involuntarily childless.

In the next section of the paper, I
draw on data from the 1965 National Fertility Study and attempt to identify the
married women without children according to their form of childlessness. In a later
section, these subgroups are compared
with one another on a number of demographic, socioeconomic, marital, and religious characteristics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

SPECIFICATION OF THE CHILDLESS
SUBPOPULATIONS

The data employed in this investigation
were taken from the 1965 National Fertility Study, a nationally representative survey of the fertility behavior of married
women conducted by Norman B. Ryder
and Charles F. Westoff (see Ryder and
Westoff, 1971). Respondents were drawn
from an areal probability sample of married women under 55 years of age, born
after July 1, 1910. Interviews were conducted for over 5,600 married women.

In the specification of the childless
sub-populations, I first excluded Negro
wives owing to their markedly different
trends in childlessness compared to the
trends for whites (Bogue, 1969, pp. 724—
729; Mommsen, 1975). I next excluded
women who were childless, but pregnant
at the time the interviews were conducted.
Not only is the size of this group small (V
= 377), but an accurate categorization of
these women is not without definitional
ambiguities. For example, should pregnant women currently without children be
classified as childless or childed? Remaining for analysis were 440 white married
women without children.

With these women, I first attempted
to separate the involuntarily from the voluntarily childless. Different strategies for
isolating these groups were followed

Poston

Social Biology

through the use of questionnaire items
concerning ability to have children, intended family size, etc. It soon became
apparent that in addition to the voluntarily and involuntarily childless, there
existed a third group of childless wives:
those who were temporarily childless for
apparently voluntary reasons.

In defining these groups, I first referred to the questionnaire item concerning physical capability to bear children. Ifa
woman reported having no children and
was biologically incapable of having children, but was not voluntarily sterilized,
she was classified as Involuntarily Childless. If a woman reported having no children, was biologically capable of having
children, but did not intend to have any
children, she was classified as Voluntarily
Childless. As I noted, however, a category of childless wives remained: the
woman who reported having no children,
was biologically capable of having children, and who intended to have one or
more children in the future. Women in this
category were classified as Temporarily
Voluntarily Childless.

There are of course problems with this
classification. The Voluntarily Childless
may be biologically incapable of having
children. But since they have been contracepting so that they would not have
children, they have never become aware
of their biological sterility or subfecundity.
They would thus define themselves as
Voluntarily Childless, when in actuality
they are Involuntarily Childless. However, their definition of their childlessness
as voluntary warrants to some extent
my classifying them as voluntary. W. I.
Thomas’ observation (quoted in Merton,
1957, p. 421) that if persons “define situations as real, they are real in their consequences” would appear to be applicable in
this context.

In a similar vein, the Involuntarily
Childless may not define as problematic
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 23, No. 3 Voluntarily and Involuntarily Childless Wives

their biological incapability to produce
children. They may well have intended in
the first place to have no children and then
discovered they were biologically incapable of doing so anyway. Thus, although
they are not able to have children, they
may not have been inclined to have children.

The Temporarily Childless are even
more enigmatic. They will eventually join
the ranks of the Childed, Voluntarily
Childless, or Involuntarily Childless
groups. If they have a child as they intend,
they become Childed. But since they have
been childless to the date of the interview
and likely have been using some form of
contraception to remain childless, they
may not know if they are biologically capable of having children. When they finally decide to have their children, they
may be unable to conceive and will thus
become Involuntarily Childless. Another
possibility is that the Temporarily Childless will continue to postpone having their
first child, maintaining the “advantages”
of their childless lifestyles. The study of
voluntarily childless wives by Veevers
(1973) is especially applicable here. She
reports that two-thirds of the childless
women in her sample did not decide on
childlessness prior to marriage, but “remained childless as a result of decisions to
postpone having children until some future time, a future which never came”
(Veevers, 1973, p. 359). If this is the experience of the Temporarily Childless in
the sample, many of them will eventually
join the ranks of the Voluntarily Childless.

These are only a few of the problems
inherent in any attempt to identify the various categories of childless wives with data
from fertility surveys. The differences
among the various subpopulations of
childless wives are manifold, and as Veevers (1972, p. 266) has observed, the application of these distinctions in the real
world is not without difficulty:

201

In order to place individuals in the appropriate category, it is necessary to know details
concerning not only their health, but also
their innermost motivations and aspirations.
Such data can be gleaned only in intensive
personal interviews and are not readily
available for representative samples of large
populations.

Nevertheless, despite the conceptual
and methodological liabilities just discussed, the employment of these dimensions of childlessness, along with their application to survey data from the 1965 National Fertility Study, will furnish us with
important information. Since we know
virtually nothing about the similarities
and differences among the categories of
childless wives, at the very worst these
data will provide us with tentative
approximations.

RESULTS

CHARACTERISTICS OF SUBGROUPS OF
CHILDLESS WIVES

Prior to examining the characteristics of
voluntarily and involuntarily childless
wives in this study, I will refer briefly to
earlier analyses of characteristics of these
groups to establish a baseline with which
my results may be compared. Two studies
have been conducted of characteristics of
the voluntarily childless (Veevers, 1973;
Gustavus and Henley, 1971), but to my
knowledge none are available on the involuntarily childless. Nevertheless, I will
attempt to suggest where possible differences and similarities may exist between
them and the voluntarily childless.

A study by Veevers (1973) based on indepth unstructured interviews with a nonrandom sample of voluntarily childless
wives in the Toronto and London areas of
Canada is most important for its observations on the characteristics of this group.
One-third of these wives, Veevers notes,
had agreed explicitly with their husbands
before marriage that they would not have

202

children. The remaining two-thirds of the
wives “remained childless as a result of
decisions to postpone having children until
some future time, a future which never
came” (Veevers, 1973, p. 359). In many
instances, both marriage partners were in
the labor force and had been gainfully employed since becoming married.

It would appear likely from the Veevers
study that as the group of wives not deciding on childlessness before marriage become more involved in their careers and as
their earnings levels increase, their career
and life-style commitments probably become more intense. They possess a career,
their own social role, the assets of which
must be evaluated if they are to entertain
the possibility of having children. In other
words, motherhood would be placed in
competition with their careers, and frequently the latter would win out. As Veevers (1973) suggests, many voluntarily
childless wives reach the decision to have
no children by virtue of their career alternatives. Thus, there may be some basis to
suggest that the voluntarily childless
should show high levels of socioeconomic
status, levels which may be higher in
many cases than those of the involuntarily
childless.

The second study is one by Gustavus
and Henley (1971, p. 283) of aselect group
of voluntarily childless couples—applicants to the Association of Voluntary
Sterilization for surgical sterilizations.
Among their conclusions, the authors note
that these childless couples reported
higher levels of socioeconomic status than
the general population of married couples.
Further, these couples were likely to be
residing in metropolitan areas and to have
been married for at least five years. Also,
they tended either to profess no religion or
to prefer the more liberal denominations.
Although the study precludes one’s
generalizing to all voluntarily childless,
these observations at the very least pro

vide a general guide with which the
characteristics data in the following section may be evaluated.

To examine the extent to which differences and similarities exist among three
groups of childless wives, I have developed percentage frequency distributions on a number of demographic, socioeconomic, marital, and religious characteristics. Presented first are comparisons
involving age and place of residence. Socioeconomic characteristics of earnings,
occupation, and education are next examined. Finally, marital and _ religious
characteristics such as number of years
married, coital frequency, and religious
preference are compared among the various subgroups. I begin by examining the
full population of childless wives in the
sample (as specified in the earlier section);
but, for reasons to be noted below, I will
turn attention thereafter to the group
30-54 years old for the balance of the
analyses.

Age.—Presented in Table 1 are frequency distributions between nine categories of wife’s age and three categories of
childlessness. Among the three subgroups
of childless wives, the Voluntarily Childless (VOLS) are somewhat older than the
Involuntarily Childless INVOLS) and as
expected, significantly older than the
Temporarily Childless (TEMPS). Half of
the VOLS are between the ages of 45 and
54, slightly more than 14 per cent of the
INVOLS are in this age group, and none
of the TEMPS are more than 44 years old.

On the basis primarily of the tabulations
in Table 1, the balance of the analyses will
be restricted to wives between the ages of
30-54. In the first place, there are too few
childless wives less than 30 years of age in
the VOLS and INVOLS subgroups. Conversely, more than 82 per cent of the
TEMPS are less than 30 years old.
Analyses of childless wives in the full age
group 20-54 years old would thus tend to

be confounded by strong age differences.
A control for age thus appears necessary.

In addition, childbearing itself, let alone
the birth of the first child, is virtually
complete by age 30. If a woman is childless at age 30, chances are not good that
she will bear a child. The actual probabilities in 1965 that a childless woman
between the ages of 30-34 would bear her
first child during that five-year period
were only 67/1,000; the probabilities were
24/1,000 for age group 35-39; and if the
woman was still childless by age 40, the
probabilities that she would bear her first
child before age 44 were a mere 5/1,000
(see Shryock and Siegel, 1971, p. 492). Ifa
woman is going to enter the childed state,
it is likely that she will do so before age 30.

Hence, the category of childless women
over age 30 is comprised of women who
probably will remain childless.
Metropolitan-nonmetropolitan residence.
—The distributions of the childless subgroups by metropolitan and nonmetropolitan residence (Table 2) suggest that considerably more of the Temporarily Childless reside in metropolitan areas than
either the Voluntarily or the Involuntarily
Childless. However, in line with the
findings of Gustavus and Henley (1971),
more of the Voluntarily than the Involuntarily Childless live in metropolitan areas,
although the difference between the two
groups is not large. Further, more of the
VOLS reside in rural nonfarm areas than
either the INVOLS or TEMPS, and more

the Voluntarily and Involuntarily Childless wives are quite similar in their distributions. The Temporarily Childless are

the Temporarily Childless received a

The VOLS and INVOLS show roughly

The distribution of the educational at

the same trends, although not as marked

concentrated at the high-school level.
Marital and_ religious characteristics.—-The first characteristic in this group
to be examined is number of years married
(see Table 5). As expected, the Temporarily Childless report, on the average, fewer
years of marriage than either the Voluntarily or the Involuntarily Childless. In
contrast, more than 38 per cent of the
VOLS, as against 22 per cent of the INVOLS and none of the TEMPS, have been
married for more than twenty years.

the date of the interview. More than 20
per cent of the Voluntarily Childless wives
report no sexual intercourse, as against 8
per cent of the Involuntarily and Temporarily childless. Another finding is the
high percentage of “Don’t know’s” among
both the VOLS (nearly 11 per cent) and
the INVOLS (over 12 per cent). Among
the TEMPS, less than 6 percent have poor
memories when recalling the frequency of
sexual intercourse. On the average, the
Voluntarily Childless participate in coitus
less often than the other two subgroups;
and the Temporarily Childless, more often. On this characteristic, clear differences exist among the three subgroups of
childless wives.

Finally, religious preference for the
groups of childless wives is reported in
Table 7. Among the Voluntarily and Involuntarily Childless wives, more than 20
per cent are Catholics, whereas about 28
per cent of the Temporarily Childless are
so classsified. Somewhat more of the
VOLS are Baptists and Methodists than
the INVOLS; in contrast, the INVOLS
are more often Fundamentalist Protestant,
and other Protestant, than are the Voluntarily Childless. As suggested by the Gustavus and Henley (1971) study mentioned
earlier, there is a slight tendency for the
Voluntarily Childless to prefer either no
affiliation or the more liberal denominations somewhat more frequently than the

Vol. 23, No. 3 Voluntarily and Involuntarily Childless Wives

Involuntarily Childless, although the differences are not great.

I have endeavored in this section to
compare a series of demographic, socioeconomic, marital, and religious characteristics among groups of Voluntarily, Involuntarily, and Temporarily Childless
wives. Although there are some important
exceptions, Voluntarily and Involuntarily
Childless wives are not markedly different
from each other. The VOLS are considerably older than the INVOLS, but the two
groups are not much different with respect
to metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan
residence, husband’s income, and total
family income. Further, the husband’s occupational distributions, as well as educational attainment for husbands and respondents, are very similar for both
groups of childless wives. The VOLS have
been married considerably longer than the
INVOLS and, on the average, engage in
coitus less frequently. The religious preferences of the two groups are rather similar.

The Temporarily Childless, however,
are quite dissimilar from the other two
childless groups. The TEMPS on the
average are in their 30’s and rank high on
most indicators of socioeconomic status.
They report fewer years of marriage than
either the VOLS or INVOLS and engage
in coitus more often. These differences,
however, may be due in part to their
younger age.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Two major objectives characterize this
investigation. I first attempted to categorize white wives by their form of childlessness. Drawing upon data from the
1965 National Fertility Study and examining responses on questionnaire items identifying physical capacity for bearing children, current number of children, and intended family size, I differentiated three
types of childlessness: Voluntary, Involun
207

tary and Temporary. Certainly there are
conceptual and methodological difficulties
with these operational distinctions, and I
have endeavored to indicate some of them.
These categories and the strategies for
identifying them are first approximations.
Survey and interview data, particularly
the Jatter, expressly developed for identifying categories of childlessness should be
more successful in capturing its essential
dimensions. Additional research with data
similar to those developed and gathered by
Veevers (1973) in her analysis of voluntary
childlessness is needed for all forms of
childlessness before we can pretend to possess an adequate understanding of the
phenomenon.

The second objective was to compare
the Voluntarily, Involuntarily, and Temporarily Childless wives across a number
of demographic, socioeconomic, marital,
and religious characteristics. From earlier
analyses, especially those of Veevers
(1973) and Gustavus and Henley (1971), I
expected that the Voluntarily Childless
would differ significantly from the Involuntarily Childless, particularly with respect to socioeconomic status, metropolitan residence, and religious preference.
However, these hypotheses were not supported. Instead, the Voluntarily and Involuntarily Childless wives were remarkably similar across most characteristics,
and both groups were very different from
the Temporarily Childless.

In an attempt to assess these findings,
several factors may be discussed. One
concerns the Temporarily Childless. Although considerable differences exist between them and the other two childless
subgroups, the small number of wives in
this category (V = 36) should be taken into
account before drawing inferences. Further, almost all of these wives are 30-to-39
years old and are thus considerably
younger than wives in the other two childless subgroups. To a certain extent, some

208

of the differences between them and the
others, e.g., frequency of coitus, may be
more a function of their younger age than
of their form of childlessness.

Another factor involves the age restrictions imposed in the investigation, an important consideration for understanding
why the Voluntarily and Involuntarily
Childless were so similar to each other on
most characteristics. Recall that I decided
to focus on women aged 30 years and over
principally because I felt that most of the
childlessness by this age would be permanent. At the same time I referred to the
many studies suggesting that the 1960’s
were a decade of change with respect to
contraceptive technology, sexual and family norms, and female preferences and
work patterns. The potential for complete
fertility control, along with changing
norms and values, has been referred to by
some as the “new fertility regime,” an era
beginning in the 1960’s (see Bumpass,
1973). Among its many expected effects is
an increase in voluntary childlessness.

However, the childless wives 30-54
years old examined in this study are not
the women who have allegedly been the
beneficiaries of the “new fertility regime,”
since the cohorts examined here would
have already completed their major
fecund years prior to 1965. My findings
apply therefore to childless wives who experienced their prime childbearing years
prior to the onset of the “new fertility re

gime” and its attendant impact on fertility
control norms and values. These are
women who reached age 30, at the latest,
by 1965. And many of these Voluntarily
Childless wives were 30 years of age in
1950. Therefore, with respect to the hypothesis arguing for differences between
the Voluntarily and Involuntarily childless, it would appear that more recent data
on childless wives are necessary before the
hypothesis may be dismissed.

As childlessness becomes more prevalent in the United States, its importance
will be acknowledged by demographers,
sociologists, and family-life experts, and
more research attention will be devoted to
the phenomenon than is currently the
case. The results reported in this study are
not without conceptual and _ methodological problems and to some extent
may raise as many questions as are answered. However, they do suggest important research hypotheses that need to be
addressed in considerably more detail than
possible in this paper.
