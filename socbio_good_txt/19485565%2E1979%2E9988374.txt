Consequences of the Number and Spacing of
Pregnancies on Outcome,

and of Pregnancy Outcome on Spacing > ~

ABSTRACT: This study is based on 3,098 once-married women in Abderdeen, Scotland, who had a
total of 10,825 pregnancies, which resulted in wastages of 285 infant deaths, 173 stillbirths, 712
involuntary abortions, and 200 voluntary terminations. Wastage varies by pregnancy number, particularly after the third pregnancy. There is, however, a selective factor operating here in that women
who have a wastage are more likely to continue on to the next higher pregnancy number, and those
who have a wastage at one pregnancy number are more likely to have a wastage at the next pregnancy outcome also. Wastage tends to be cumulative. Women who enter the reproductive cycle at
the younger ages have a larger number of pregnancies and a higher wastage rate than women who
postpone their first pregnancy until the older ages. Women who experience a wastage at any given
pregnancy number are not only more likely to have another pregnancy, but they do so over a shorter
time interval than those whose last pregnancy resulted in a live birth. Except for terminations, wastage is highest among women who closely space their pregnancy.

The relationship between infant mortality and fertility continues to be an important theoretical as well as practical
problem among demographers (Preston,
1975, 1977; Freedman, 1963; Matthiessen, 1975). In its simplist form the relationship is hypotheseized to be that mortality declines are eventually followed by
fertility declines (Scrimshaw, 1978). Due
to the lack of more appropriate data, this
relationship has frequently been examined at the macro level (Heer, 1966;
Coale, 1973; Matthiessen, 1975; Knodel,
1975). However, the findings of such
studies are not only inconsistent but even
contradictory. For example, Heer (1966)
notes that the levels of infant mortality
were shown to be among the strongest and
most consistent predictors of fertility
Jevels; but more recently Coale (1973) has
noted that according to the findings of the

European Fertility Project of Princeton
University “‘the time sequences of declines in infant mortality and fertility in
Eurpoean regions simply failed to support
the notion that mortality change had been
a broadly significant factor in fertility
change in the majority of the population”
(Preston, 1975, p. 11).

In summarizing the findings for eight of
the countries examined in the Princeton
European Fertility Project, P. C. Matthiessen (1975) concluded that ‘the results of these countries made it clear that
no firm conclusions can be drawn on the
relationship between child mortality and
marital fertility in Europe during the demographic transition. Comparing the
different countries, the results are contradictory.””

In a review article examining the evidence on the relationship between infant

161

mortality and fertility, Helen Ware
(1977), citing van de Walle and Knodel
(1967) notes that “Despite the pronouncements of classical transition theory, it is
difficult to produce an example of a European country where a prior improvement
in child survival was the major factor obliging parents to restrict their fertility
within marriage.”

The lack of a clear-cut understanding of
this issue is to be expected since there area
large number of extraneous variables at
the macro level that affect both infant
mortality and fertility. The obvious problem here is that both infant mortality decline and fertility decline may be a function of economic development and broad
societal changes. Both changes may be
due to a common variable. As one author
has observed, ‘Needless to say, such an
oversimplified approach has contributed
little to a better understanding of this complex relationship” (Friedlander, 1977, p.
183).

Preston (1975) has claimed that in order to test adequately the hypothesis that
fertility is in fact affected by infant mortality the analysis has to be at the individual
family level. Helen Ware (1977) also
notes, ‘‘For the analysis of the causal relationship between child mortality and fertility it is necessary to turn to family
studies,” as opposed to aggregate studies
based on crude demographic measures,
which provide the most readily availablecross-national data (Oechsli and Kirk,
1975).

At the individual family level, it is
usually hypothesized that infant mortality
inflates fertility. But the opposite argument that high fertility inflates mortality is
also found. Knodel (1968, p. 297), for example, states:

The possible influence of fertility on
mortality, although occasionally acknow}edged, is rarely given serious consideration.
Nevertheless, some evidence has been ac
Social Biology

cumulated which suggests that fertility can
have a substantial effect on infant mortality.
More specifically, several studies have demonstrated that infants born after a relatively
short interval experience considerably
higher mortality than those born after
longer intervals.

At the individual family level, the mortality-fertility link is most frequently
stated in terms of the child replacement
hypotheses (Friedlander, 1977; Ware,
1977; Scrimshaw, 1978). This specified
that “parents will strive to replace dead
children” (Ware, 1977) or that “when a
child dies, it is hypothesized, a couple will
attempt to ‘replace’ it as quickly as possible” (Scrimshaw, 1978, p. 384). Accordingly, child loss may lead to direct attempts to replace the lost child.
Consequently, ‘‘declines in mortality
should lead to a direct decline in fertility
(assuming adequate fertility control
mechanisms are accessible) because replacement births would not be necessary”’
(Singarimbun and Hull, 1977). Thus, according to this body of literature, high
mortality is a stimulus to higher fertility.
But there is quite a different dimension to
the problem. In a recent article on the fertility-mortality equation, Scrimshaw
(1978) notes that while the idea is seldom
mentioned, mortality may sometimes be a
response to high fertility instead of a stimulus to it. Several studies in a different
cultural settings are cited by Scrimshaw
which show that mortality does have a
positive effect on fertility (Snyder, 1974;
DaVanzo, 1972).

One of the most extensive attempts to
study the replacement effect was that by
Lery and Vallin (1975) for France. This
study was based on a large sample of women born 1892-1916. This population was
already practicing family planning extensively, thus satisfying the most important
requirement for estimating the replacement effect. The authors demonstrated
that parity progression ratios were higher

by 19-28 per cent for those women whose
child died in infancy compared with women whose child survived. A number of
other studies have also shown a relationship between child loss and fertility. Hassen (1973, p. 368) in an Egyptian study
showed that “‘for all marital duration
groups, at each education level and for
both Muslims and Christians, the average
number of children born per mother increased when they had had experience
with child deaths.”

Scrimshaw (1978) notes, however, that
still other studies provide examples of the
failure to replace dead children. To illustrate, in a Guatemalan study it was reported that “women do not seem to be
overcompensating for an intra-interval
death by hastening the coming of the next
conception” (Teller, 1975). Thus, even
in a low mortality population such as
Canada, Newcombe and Rhynas (1962)
failed to find evidence for compensation in
many infant deaths. There was some
““overcompensation” in the first year following stillbirths, no difference in the second year, and fewer children than expected in the third and fourth years. It was
a case of either early replacement or none
at all.

Evidence to suggest that mortality rates
are a function of high fertility is found in
the Puffer and Serrano (1975) study of a
number of Latin American countries.
They report that infant deaths increase
with ascending birth order. In both Recife, Brazil, and in Monterrey, Mexico,
the proportion of children that died in infancy was three to four times higher for
fifth and higher births than for first- and
second-born children (Puffer and Serrano, 1975). Similar findings have been reported for other areas as well (Omran,
1971).

Still others interested in the mortalityfertility link have focused on the spacing
between pregnancy events. This type of

Number and Spacing of Pregnancies 163

research is only indirectly related to the
replacement hypothesis, but it tends to be
viewed as largely related to that framework. However, the questions raised are
somewhat different. Here, the issues of
concern are twofold: First, how do infant
deaths affect the spacing between births,
and secondly, how does the spacing between births affect infant losses?

There is considerable evidence to show
that infant deaths affect the spacing interval to the next birth. To illustrate, in her
Gampian study, based on individual longitudinal data taken from the continuous
registration system of a Gampian village,
Thompson (1975), reports that the
average interval between births increased
from approximately 15 months in the case
of either a stillbirth or infant death to
around 35 months if the child survived at
least two years.

In a study in Ankara, Adlakha (1973)
reported that for women not using contraception the interpregnancy interval between the second and third birth was 19
months if both first and second births had
died, 23 months if only the second had
died, and 36 months if neither had died.
The author also reported that for contraceptive users the average interval following a child that survived past age one was
40 months as compared with 22 months
where the infant dies. Similar findings
have been reported for several countries
in arecent World Health Organization report (Omran and Standley, 1976). These
data, however, tell us only how quickly
women had another birth. They do not tell
us what proportion of women went on to
have another pregnancy.

Focusing on how spacing of births
affects infant loss, Knodel (1968) reports
the percentage dying before age one declines sharply as the length of the previous
birth interval increases, providing the preceding child survives to the end of the interval. He noted that infants born after

164

short intervals were subject to higher mortality than were infants born following
longer intervals, providing the previous
child was still living at the time of the following birth. The same author goes on to
note that infant mortality is higher for
births following infant deaths than for
births following live births that survived.
No doubt this is influenced by the shorter
interval between events. At any rate, it is
suggested that mortality risks among siblings are positively correlated.

Several other studies have also shown
that the spacing interval greatly influenced
postneonatal and infant deaths (Wyon
and Gordon, 1971; Wolfers and Scrimshaw, 1975). These findings are particularly significant, because as Knodel notes
“the fact that fertility can exercise a substantial influence on infant mortality has
serious implications for the interpretation
of correlations between the two variables.
It is not justifiable to treat infant mortality
purely as the independent variable.”

It is quite clear from the limited evidence available that the mortality-fertility
link is acomplex issue. There is considerable evidence to support both propositions,
1.e., that high fertility is a stimulus to high
mortality and that high mortality is a stimulus to high fertility. Thus, further research in this area needs little justification.

The research literature on the mortality-fertility link has focused on four
different dimensions: (1) How do child
losses affect fertility? (2) How does fertility affect losses? (3) How do losses affect
spacing to next birth? (4) How does the
spacing of births affect losses? Most
studies that have addressed these questions have been limited only to births and
infant deaths. Thus, measures of attempts
at replacement, as well as spacing, have
been limited only to those that were
successful in producing another birth.
This is a serious shortcoming.

In this paper we suggest that if data

Zimmer

Social Biology

were available only for infant deaths and
births much of the effort at reproduction,
as well as efforts at “replacement” of
losses, is excluded from the analysis. What
is needed are complete pregnancy histories by outcome, since those who do experience an infant death or any other type of
loss may attempt “replacement” but may
do so unsuccessfully because of pregnancy
wastage. In other words, to examine only
additional births (including stillbirths),
may grossly understate attempts at replacement and the spacing of events. ‘“Replacement effects” and “‘spacing effects”
are also to be seen in further attempts at
reproduction when losses occur prior to
full term. In short, attention should be focused on further attempts at reproduction
related to the specific outcome of each
pregnancy event. To do this, one needs
complete pregnancy histories.

This paper focuses on three issues: (1)
What ts the relationship between pregnancy outcome and the proportion of women who go on to have another pregnancy? (2) How does the number and
spacing of pregnancies affect outcome?
(3) How does pregnancy outcome, in turn,
influence the number and spacing of succeeding pregnancy events?

Their reproductive behavior was followed
through 1970. Thus, the sample represents a cross-section of families who experienced a pregnancy during a specified
time period rather than a cross-section of

the urban community (Freedman and
Coombs, 1966). Complete reproductive
histories of a one-in-five random sample
were obtained from the maternity hospital
records in Aberdeen. This is a central record-keeping system which also includes
all of the domiciliary deliveries in the community.2 At the end of the follow-up
period, more than eight of ten of the women were forty years of age or over and
thus had largely completed their reproduction. They had a total of 10,825 pregnancies, which resulted in 9,592 live births
that survived the first year, 285 infant
deaths, 173 stillbirths, 712 involuntary
abortions, and 200 voluntary terminations. The number of outcomes exceed the
number of pregnancies since some of the

outcomes (1.2 per cent) involved multiple
products.

Before proceeding with the analysis, let
us look at the general pregnancy experience of the total sample. The number
and percentage of women who continued
on to a given pregnancy number is shown
in Table 1. Most of the women (93 per
cent) continued to the second pregnancy,
but after that the dropout rate was rapid.
The number continuing to the third pregnancy declined to two-thirds, and only
four out of ten continued on to their fourth
pregnancy. After the sixth pregnancy, 94
per cent had reached the end of their reproductive cycle, and the proportion continued to decline steadily after each subsequent event. After the second pregnancy,
four or five out of every ten women
dropped out after each subsequent pregnancy. The followng discussion is limited
only to the first six pregnancies because of
the small size of the sample at the higher
pregnancy numbers.

WASTAGE BY PREGNANCY NUMBER

As is evident from Table 2, wastage rates vary directly by pregnancy number,
particularly after the third pregnancy outcome. The proportion of pregnancies that
resulted in a wastage ranges from 10 to 12
per cent for the first three pregnancies and
increases to more than 20 per cent by the
sixth pregnancy outcome. A selective factor operating here, however, is that the
probability of continuing on to another
pregnancy is much higher in the case of
wastage than if the pregnancy resulted ina
live birth that survived the first year. For
the first four pregnancies, the differences
are substantial. For example, all of the
wives whose first pregnancy resulted in
wastage continued on to the second pregnancy, whereas 8.2 per cent of those who
had a live birth that lived did not do so. Of
the women who went on to the second
pregnancy and had a live birth that lived,
only about two-thirds continued on to a
third pregnancy, as compared to 96 per
cent of those that experienced a wastage.

Similar differences are found for later
pregnancy outcomes also. Women having
a wastage at any given pregnancy number,
at least through the first four pregnancies,
are much more likely to go on to have
another pregnancy than are those whose
pregnancy resulted in a live birth that survived the first year of life, thus suggesting
attempts at replacement. It is not until the
fifth pregnancy that the proportion that
goes on to have additional pregnancies is
unrelated to the outcome of the previous
event.

The data shown in Figure 1, as well as in
Table 2, suggest that wastage is cumulative, that is, that the wastage rate is higher
in the next pregnancy among those who
had previously experienced a wastage in
their last pregnancy. But regardless of the
previous pregnancy outcome, the wastage
rate increases directly by pregnancy number. These data suggest that repeated
pregnancies increase the probability that
the pregnancy will result in a wastage. The
higher-order pregnancies thus contribute

a disproportionately high number to the
overall pregnancy wastage rate in the population. This is due, in part, to the fact that
women who experience wastage also tend
disproportionately to go on to the higher
pregnancy numbers (Omran and
Standley, 1976).

When we examine the outcome of each
pregnancy according to the previous pregnancy experiences, we find that there is a
disproportionately high rate of wastage at
any given pregnancy number among those
who have experienced a wastage at an
early pregnancy. As the number of pregnancies resulting in a wastage increases,
the probability of having a wastage from
the next pregnancy also increases.* To illustrate, the wastage rates at the fourth
pregnancy outcome, as shown in Figure 1,
tend to vary by the number of previous
pregnancies that resulted in a wastage.
The order in which the previous wastages
occurred is important. For women whose
first pregnancy outcome was a live birth
that lived, we find that if they did not have
a wastage at either the second or third
pregnancy, only 12.5 per cent experienced
a wastage at the fourth pregnancy. But if
these women had only one wastage at
either the second or third pregnancy, the
loss rate increased at the fourth pregnancy
to 15.2 per cent if the previous wastage
was at the second pregnancy, but to 15.9
per cent if it was at the third pregnancy
outcome. Among women whose first
pregnancy was a live birth that lived but
whose second and third pregnancies resulted in wastages, the wastage rate at the
fourth pregnancy was 22.9 per cent.

Even greater wastage occurs for women whose first pregnancy resulted in a
wastage. If such women did not have a

rather than on the level of statistical significance.

wastage at either the second or third pregnancy, only 7 per cent had a wastage at the
fourth pregnancy. However, if they had a
wastage at the second pregnancy, in addition to the first, their loss rate increased to
17.2 per cent by the fourth pregnancy. It
jumped to 38.5 per cent among those who
had a loss at the third pregnancy, and to
47.1 per cent among those whose second
and third pregnancies had both resulted in
wastages. The latter is more than double
the rate (22.9 per cent) noted for women
whose first pregnancy outcome was a live
birth that lived but whose next two pregnancies resulted in a wastage.

SPACING BY Last PREGNANCY OUTCOME

We now turn to an examination of the
relationship between pregnancy outcome
and the spacing to the next pregnancy
event, as well as the impact that spacing
has on the next pregnancy outcome. The
first part of the analysis is limited to the
first four pregnancies because of the limited number of cases in the sample. The
spacing interval is measured in terms of
the time span between pregnancy outcomes. Obviously, this type of measure introduces a serious bias in favor of showing
higher wastage among women with short
intervals when looking at the impact that
spacing has on outcome, because of the
shorter intervals related to events that do
not run full term. However, this measure
would not bias the results when looking at
the impact that pregnancy outcome has on
the spacing interval to the next pregnancy
outcome which is the issue of concern in
the following discussion.

It is evident from the data shown in Figures 2 and 3 that the spacing to the next
pregnancy varies substantially by the outcome of the previous event. Women at
any given pregnancy number are less
likely to have their next pregnancy closely
spaced if they had a live birth that survived
the first year than if they experienced a

wastage.* Women most likely to have
their next pregnancy outcome closely
spaced are those whose last pregnancy resulted in an involuntary abortion. The
differences in the distribution of spacing
intervals to the next pregnancy outcome
by last pregnancy outcome are substantial. To illustrate, less than 10 per cent of
the women whose first pregnancy resulted
in a live birth had the next pregnancy outcome with 14 months, as compared with
nearly 20 per cent of those who had a live
birth that died, more that 30 per cent of
those who had a stillbirth, and nearly 40
per cent of those who had an involuntary
abortion. It is noted further that while less
than one-fourth of the women whose first
pregnancy resulted in a live birth had their
next pregnancy outcome within an interval of 15 to 24 months, approximately 40
per cent of those who had a wastage had
their second pregnancy outcome within
this time interval.

For the total sample, the average spacing interval between pregnancy outcomes

: Unfortunately, no data are available on the lactation practices of the women in this sample. Such
data would be valuable since this is the biological
mechanism affecting spacing in relationship to child
survival. It is noted, however, that this is an important intermediate variable in spacing which no doubt
accounts for part of the longer spacing intervals
found among women whose last pregnancy resulted
in a live birth that survived the first year.

is summarized in Table 3. The average interval is slightly more than three years, but
the length of the interval between pregnancy outcomes, at each pregnancy number, varies markedly by the outcome of
the last pregnancy. The average spacing is
much longer for women whose last pregnancy resulted in a live birth than it is for
women who experienced a wastage of any
type. Among the women whose last pregnancy resulted in wastage, it is those who
experienced an involuntary abortion who
have the shortest spacing interval to the
next pregnancy outcome. Actually, they
have the next pregnancy outcome in about
half the time of those who had a live birth.
The same general range of difference is
found at each pregnancy number. These
data demonstrate the need for taking into
account the previous pregnancy outcome
in our attempts to understand the
“tempo” of reproductive behavior.
Women who experienced a pregnancy
wastage of any type apparently attempted
to make up for the loss by “‘trying again”’
after a very short interval of time. And, as
noted earlier (Table 2), women were
much more likely, at any given pregnancy
number, to continue on to the next pregnancy if they had a wastage than if they
had a live birth. Thus, not only are women
more likely to have another pregnancy if
they experience a wastage, but they have

years or less, while approximately half of
those who had a wastage had the next

consistency of the difference at each pregnancy number is worthy of note.

The differences in spacing by previous
pregnancy outcome are even more evident when we look at the cumulative percentage distribution of the spacing of

whose first pregnancy outcome was a live

whereas at least two out of three of those

eight out of ten of the women who had an
involuntary abortion had their next pregnancy outcome within the two-year period. A very similar pattern of difference ts

PREGNANCY OUTCOME By SPACING

In the following discussion, our attention is focused on the impact that spacing
has on the outcome of subsequent pregnancy events. It is hypothesized that the
wastage rate will be higher among women
who more closely space their pregnancies
than among those who space their pregnancies over a longer time interval. It is assumed here that the latter would be in better physical conditions to produce a live
birth than those who had experienced
closely spaced pregnancies. The evidence
presented in Table 5 confirms our hypothesis at each pregnancy number. Except for voluntary terminations, the wastage rate is highest among the more closely
spaced outcomes.

It should be cautioned that our spacing

pregnancy outcomes, could seriously bias
the results in favor of showing that particular types of wastage would be higher
among women with short intervals. This
applies to any outcome that is not a fullterm product. To minimize this bias, we
have examined different types of losses
separately. In addition, the shortest spacing interval covers a time span which is
above the average interval for all pregnancy outcomes, and considerably above
the average interval for each type of wastage as shown in Table 3. This, in part,
compensates for the bias associated with
the shorter intervals expected for involuntary abortions and voluntary terminations. However, even allowing for the potential bias of our spacing interval on
outcomes, we find the pattern of
difference shown in Table 5 is noteworthy.

Clearly there is a substantial excess of
infant deaths and stillbirths among the
more closely spaced outcomes. The loss
rate is approximately double among the
more closely spaced outcomes up through
the fouth pregnancy and jumps to nearly a
fourfold excess at the higher pregnancy
numbers. A similar pattern is found for involuntary abortions also; but in spite of
the bias favoring short time intervals, the
size of the difference is much less marked.
Contrary to expectations, just the opposite pattern is found for terminations. As

expected, the termination rate increases
by pregnancy number, but the rate is
highest among women with the longest
spacing intervals. Apparently these women attempted to avoid another pregnancy, and they were successful up to a
point, but when such efforts failed they
turned to terminations. At any rate, the
spacing of pregnancies does appear to
have a sizeable impact on outcome. The
net effect is for the wastage rate to be
highest among those who closely space
their outcomes.°

The proportion of pregnancy outcomes
that result in a live birth varies both by the
age of mother and parity. As shown in
Table 6, frequent attempts at child
> In the above analysis we have combined the two
shortest intervals used in Table 3 because of the bias
of the shortest interval associated with events that
did not run full term. However, in a separate analysis
of the shorter interval (under 24 months), we observed the same pattern of difference for each type of
wastage, but for the shorter interval we found the
differences to be even more marked than those
shown in Table 5. In other words, the shorter the
spacing interval, the higher the loss rate. The relationship is found to be linear for all types of losses
except for voluntary terminations. After the third
pregnancy, the termination rate starts higher for the
shortest spacing interval (under 24 months) but declines for the next interval (25 to 44 months), then
reaches a peak among those with the longest spacing
interval (45 months or more). Losses due to involuntary abortions are much higher when a shorter interval is used in the analysis, but, as noted, this is to be
expected because of the bias of how the spacing interval is measured.

bearing, particularly at the younger ages,
result in a low proportion of live births.
For example, if women had a third pregnancy outcome before reaching 21 years
of age, two-thirds resulted in a live birth,
but the proportion drops to only slightly
more than half among those who had a
fourth pregnancy by this age. To illustrate
further, among women who had a sixth
pregnancy between 20 and 24 years of age,
only one-third resulted in a live birth; but
the survival rate was nearly three-fourths
for women who were 25-29 years of age
and increased to more than 80 per cent if
the women were 30 years of age or older
by the time they had their sixth pregnancy
outcome. While the proportion of pregnancies that result in a live birth declines
by pregnancy number, the decline is most
marked among women who have the
higher order pregnancy events at the
younger ages. How much of the high loss
rate is due to the debilitating effects of frequent attempts at childbearing, particularly at the younger ages, and how much is
due to a policy of obstetric intervention
under these conditions cannot be determined from the data at hand. That there is
a policy of intervention in practice, however, has been reported elsewhere (Zimmer, 1979).

SUMMARY

From the above discussion, it is evident
that wastage rates vary by pregnancy number, particularly after the third pregnancy
outcome. There is, however, a selective
factor operating here in that women who
have a wastage are more likely to continue
on to the next higher pregnancy number;
and those who have a wastage at one pregnancy number are more likely to have a
wastage at the next pregnancy outcome
also. In these cases, repeated attempts at
reproduction tends to increase wastage. In
short, the evidence suggests that wastage
is cumulative. As the number of pregnan
Social Biology

cies resulting in wastage increases, the
probability of having another wastage also
increases. Women who enter the reproductive cycle at the younger ages are more
likely to have a larger number of pregnancies and a higher wastage rate than women
who postpone their first pregnancy until
the older ages.

The spacing of successive pregnancy
events varies substantially by the outcome
of the last pregnancy. Women who experience a wastage, at any given pregnancy
number, are not only more likely to have
another pregnancy, but they are likely to
do so over a shorter time interval than
those whose last pregnancy resulted in a
live birth. The spacing between pregnancy
events, at any given number, has an impact
on outcome. The wastage rate is highest
among women who closely space their
pregnancies and at higher parity levels.
The wastage rate due to involuntary abortions as well as to infant deaths and stillbirths is particularly high at the higher
pregnancy numbers among those who
closely space succeeding pregnancy
events, suggesting that there well might be
a biological component which would account for some of the relationships noted.

In extending the analysis of the mortality-fertility tink to include all wastage, we
find that frequent attempts at childbearing
substantially increase the probability of
having a wastage, thus suggesting that the
high reproducers contribute disproportionately to the loss rate. At the same
time, when a loss does occur, there is an
apparent attempt to replace the loss, at
least up through the fifth parity, and to do
so quicker, but these efforts are frequently
not successful. Apparently, losses result in
further attempts at reproduction, which
not only add additional births, but contribute further to the loss rate. To limit the
analysis only to the relationship between
infant mortality and actual births as a
measure of the replacement effect is to
miss much of the effort at reproduction
