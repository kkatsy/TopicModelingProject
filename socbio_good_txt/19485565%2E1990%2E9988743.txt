ABSTRACT: This paper compares the mortality experience of foreign- and native-born Irish,
Italians, and Jews in New York City in 1979-81. In most cases, denominator data were not
available, so proportional mortality analysis was used. An estimation procedure was
undertaken to show the degree to which standardized proportional mortality ratios
approximate relative standardized mortality measures. Major and lifestyle-related causes of
death were examined, as were specific sites of cancer. While no consistent pattern merged
which related nativity or ethnicity to the relative distribution of mortality, it does appear that
the intra-ethnic patterns of the Irish group were unique relative to those of the Italian and
Jewish groups. Overall, this study suggests a number of interesting relationships between
ethnicity, nativity, and the distribution of mortality by cause.

This study compares the mortality experience of native- and foreign-born
Irish, Italians, and Jews in New York
City in 1979-81. Many Studies of differential mortality by ethnicity have used
immigrant populations but relatively
few have compared native-born and
foreign-born populations of the same
ethnic group. Such a comparison is useful in examining the extent to which the
environment of the host country may influence the mortality experience of an
ethnic group, as genetic effects are more
or less “controlled” for in a study of two
generations of the same ethnic group.

Studies of immigrant mortality frequently find that as the period of residence in the host country increases, the
mortality pattern of the immigrant population approaches that of the native
population. The mortality rates of immigrants are often below those in their
country of birth, an advantage that
might be attributable to the “healthy mi
11

grant” selection bias (Marmot et al.,
1984; Kasl and Berkman, 1983). Immigrants are nevertheless frequently at a
mortality disadvantage with respect to
the native-born population of the host
country. Yet, as the length of residence
increases, the mortality rates of the immigrants often reach some point between those of the host country and
those of their country of birth. In a recent review, Adelstein et al. (1984) comment that migrant studies “show that
rates of diseases in immigrants are often
broadly similar to rates in their country
of origin, and that these may change
within the first or later generations towards the risk of the host population.
This would point to the influence of environment” (p. 315). This tendency varies greatly by cause of death.

This process of assimilation should
ultimately result in the convergence of
the mortality patterns and levels of the
native-born descendants of the immi

grants and the native-born population.
A Canadian study argues that both the
immigration selection effect and the
process of assimilation work together to
bridge the mortality gap between immigrant and native populations: “Thus,
the relative mortality disadvantage of
the first generation . . . is overcome by
the descendants of the immigrants. It is
likely that the rapidity of this process
will vary depending on the degree of socioeconomic success of the first generation in the adoptive society” (Trovato,
1985, p. 53). The rapidity of this process
would also be expected to vary considerably by cause of death.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The present study examines mortality by cause among persons 45-84 years
of age in the foreign- and native-born
Irish, Italian, and Jewish populations of
New York City in 1979-81. Death record tapes for these years were made
available by the City of New York Department of Public Health. These tapes
excluded deaths of city residents which
occurred outside of New York. Deaths
of persons under 45 years of age were
not included for our study purposes because there were relatively few deaths.
Deaths of those over age 85 were excluded because classification of death to
a single cause is more difficult at advanced ages when multiple chronic conditions are frequently present. Major
and “‘lifestyle-related” causes of death
were examined, as well as specific cancer sites.

The three ethnic study groups were
selected, in part, because they are of sufficient size to permit analysis of both
foreign- and native-born populations.
As most Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants entered the United States before

Social Biology

1930, there were in 1980 sufficient numbers of middle-aged or older nativeborn children. The foreign- and nativeborn members of these ethnic groups
contribute significantly to the overall
population of New York, comprising
more than one half of the entire white
population (excluding Puerto Ricans)
between ages 45 and 84 resident in New
York City in 1980.

During the years 1979-81 more than
55,000 deaths of persons aged 45-84
years occurred in New York City among
those categorized as Irish, Italian, or
Jewish. Among the six ethnicity-nativity
groups examined here the numbers of
deaths ranged from 3,007 for Irish
foreign-born persons to 15,434 for Jewish native-born persons. Figures for the
numbers of males and females in each
group are shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4.

A lack of comparable numerators
and denominators has complicated the
analysis of the mortality patterns of
most of the ethnic groups under consideration. Since 1978, the death certificate
for New York City has included an item
on ethnicity or ancestry. However, for
the native-born Italian and Irish groups,
and for the foreign- and native-born
Jewish groups, these numerator statistics are not compatible with denominator data in the 1980 decennial census.
Jews were considered to be only a religious group by the Census Bureau in
1980, and since religion is not asked in a
decennial census, their numbers were
not recorded (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1983a, p. B-8).

The calculation of mortality rates for
the native-born Italian and Irish groups
is complicated by procedures for listing
and coding ethnicity on the death record
and in the census. The death certificate
has only a single designation of ethnicity
while the census permitted multiple listings. Thus, decedents who may have

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 37, No. 1-2

been listed, for example, as “ItalianGerman” in the census would have only
one ethnicity coded on their death record. In addition, many decedents, primarily those born in the United States
were simply described as “American.”
Whereas only 5 per cent of foreign-born
whites were so classified, the level
reached 35 per cent among the U.S.born. As a result, it appears likely a substantial number of U.S.-born Italian and
Irish decedents were listed as ‘““American.” The use of death record counts
then would result in a significant undercount of these groups.

In computing rates for a standard
population, we used data for the total
white population of New York City excluding Puerto Ricans. The latter were
excluded because their mortality pattern differs markedly from that of other
New Yorkers.!

Despite the absence of appropriate
mortality rate data, useful substitute
techniques have been developed which
make the analysis of mortality possible.
Proportional mortality analysis, a “numerator” technique, compares the distribution of deaths among the study
population to that of a standard population. By comparing the observed numbers of death by cause with those expected, ratios can be calculated which
show excesses and deficits of deaths by
cause. In the absence of necessary denominator data, proportional mortality
ratios are used in this study.

The possibility of bias in mortality
data should be noted. As mentioned
previously, procedures concerning the
listing and coding of ancestry on death
certificates have resulted in an incomplete count of native-born Irish and Italian decedents. Surname analysis has re

vealed that approximately 25 per cent of
U.S.-born decedents with Italian surnames were classified as “American” on
their death certificates and were not included in the counts used for this study.
Thus, the proportional mortality analysis is not based on a complete count of
deaths for native-born Irish and Italians.
Furthermore, the error may not be random, since the excluded decedents are
those categorized by their families
“American,” representing perhaps the
most assimilated of the second (or third)
generation populations.

The excluded population may also include persons with Irish or Italian surnames who are of mixed ancestry. Persons of mixed ancestry should be
excluded from this study when possible,
because they are not genetically equivalent to the foreign-born populations.
Unfortunately, data on the ethnicity of
the parents of native-born decedents are
not available. In identifying the Jewish
decedents, there was a different problem as the death certificate has no item
on religion. Instead, the religious denomination of the cemetery was used.
MacMahon and Koller (1957) have
found that the decedents buried in Jewish cemeteries are almost exclusively
Jewish.

One potential problem in the calculation of proportional mortality ratios was
the choice of a standard population. In
this study, the standard population was
the entire white population, excluding
Puerto Ricans, in New York City. Obviously, all six ethnic-nativity groups in
the study are also members of this standard pcpulation. However, we calculated
an alternative set of proportional mortality ratios standardized on the United
States white population, and the ratios
were not significantly different from
those calculated on the New York City
standard. Moreover, the distribution of

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

14 Rosenwaike and Hempstead

deaths in New York differs somewhat
from that of the United States as a
whole. For instance, New York has a
relatively higher proportion of deaths
from cirrhosis and homicide and a relatively lower proportion of accidental
deaths. New York also has a higher frequency of heart disease and a lower frequency of cerebrovascular disease than
the rest of the country, but this fact may
be due to local practice in classifying
causes of death. Based on these considerations, we decided to use as a standard
the New York City mortality distribution rather than the U.S. distribution
which would introduce distortions that
might confound residential and ethnic
characteristics.

We had sufficient data to calculate
mortality rates for the foreign-born Irish
and Italians, whose death records and
census classifications had a close correspondence. The denominators for these
rates were derived from the 5 per cent
sample of the 1980 Census Public Use
Microdata files (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 19835). We calculated age- and
cause-specific death rates and agestandardized cause-specific rates. The
availability of these rates make it possible to test the reliability of the proportional mortality data. In 1978, Kupper et
al. outlined a procedure to check the reliability of proportional mortality ratios.
It consisted of calculating an approximation measure taken from a ratio of
standardized mortality ratios (SMR’s)
and then constructing a confidence interval to check the closeness of the approximation.

Kupper et al. (1978) have pointed out
a basic disadvantage of proportional
mortality analysis. As a “numerator”
statistic, it measures relative, but not absolute, differences in cause-specific
mortality. In other words, a propor
Social Biology

tional mortality ratio may indicate that a
particular population has a significant
excess or deficit in the proportional distribution of mortality from a certain
cause. The ratio, however, does not
reflect absolute differences in the level
of mortality by cause and for all causes
in the two populations. If the absolute
mortality conditions of the two populations differ markedly, then a standardized mortality ratio (a ratio of causespecific mortality rates) may show a
relationship between the two populations which is the opposite of that
reflected in the proportional mortality
ratio. Conversely, standardized mortality ratios do not reflect differences in the
relative distribution of mortality by
cause. To correct for this, researchers
often calculate cause-specific relative
standardized mortality ratios (RSMR)
by dividing cause-specific SMR’s by the
SMR for mortality from all causes.
Kupper et al. (1978) note that the
standardized proportional mortality ratio (SPMR calculated by taking the ratio
for the proportion of deaths from cause i
in the test population to the proportion
of deaths from cause 7 in the standard
population) is mathematically equivalent to the RSMR. They observe that
the standardized proportional mortality
ratio, despite the absence of information on the population at risk, appears to
provide a short cut to the calculation of
the RSMR. This suggests that proportional mortality analysis may be more
useful in mortality studies than previously thought. As Kupper et al. (1978,
p. 17) comment: “Because of the previously mentioned pitfalls of ‘numerator’
analysis, proportional mortality rates
have been used sparingly in mortality
studies. . . . The potential of the SPMR
as an important index of mortality appears to have been largely overlooked.”

Kupper et al. (1978) have outlined a
procedure for calculating RSMR’s and
SPMR’s and constructing a confidence
interval at the 0.01 level to test the closeness of the approximation. We used this
procedure with the data on causespecific mortality for the foreign-born
Irish and Italian groups. In all but five of
the sixty cases tested, the RSMR fell
within the confidence interval around
the SPMR. This close approximation of
the SPMR to the RSMR provides an important verification of the proportional
mortality data used in this study.

RESULTS
INTRA-ETHNIC DIFFERENTIALS

Proportional mortality ratios for the
foreign- and native-born Irish, Italian,
and Jewish populations, both sexes
combined, are shown in Table 1. With
regard to the major causes of death, the
Irish exhibit the greatest differences between foreign- and native-born populations. Compared with the foreign-born
Irish, the native-born Irish have a proportional mortality ratio that is significantly higher for pneumonia and influenza, and significantly lower for
stroke, accidents, diabetes, cirrhosis,
and homicide. Despite these significant
differences between the proportional
mortality ratios of the foreign- and
native-born Irish groups, there is no
definite trend toward convergence with
the mortality pattern of the standard
population. For half of the major causes
of death, the native-born Irish have proportional mortality ratios which less
closely approximate the standard population than do the ratios for the foreignborn Irish.

Among the Italian groups, the proportional mortality ratios of the nativeborn group are similar to those of the

Differential Mortality 15

foreign-born group for all causes, except
for accidents, cirrhosis, and homicide.
The proportional mortality ratios of the
native-born group for most major
causes diverge only slightly from those
of the foreign-born group, with the exception of accidents, cirrhosis, and
homicide. For the major causes of
death, the foreign-born and native-born
Jewish groups exhibit similar proportional mortality ratios, with the exception of diabetes, homicide, and pneumonia, and influenza. The Jewish
pattern resembles that of the Italians in
that: (1) there is little overall difference
between the proportional mortality ratios of the two nativity groups, and (2)
the proportional mortality ratios of the
native-born groups tend to be lower
than those of the foreign-born groups.

For specific types of cancer, the
native-born Irish population, compared
with the foreign-born population, has
proportional mortality ratios that are
significantly higher for cancers of the colon, prostate, and esophagus, and significantly lower for cancers of the breast,
pancreas, stomach, and leukemia. The
proportional mortality ratio of the
native-born population is closer to 1.0
than is that of the foreign-born population for cancer of the colon alone; for all
seven other types of cancer listed, the
native population has a proportional
mortality ratio which is further from 1.0.
So while there are significant differences
in the ratio of observed to expected mortality for specific sites of cancer between
the foreign- and native-born Irish
groups, these are not due to the mortality distribution of the native-born more
closely approaching that of the standard
population.

For the Italians, the native-born population compared to the foreign-born
population, has proportional mortality

ratios that are significantly higher for
cancers of the breast and esophagus and
significantly lower for cancer of the
stomach and leukemia. For the Jewish
groups, the native-born population,
compared to the foreign-born population, has proportional mortality ratios
that are significantly higher for cancers
of the breast and prostate and leukemia,
and lower for cancers of the pancreas,
esophagus, and stomach. Like the
native-born Italians, the native-born
Jewish group has higher proportional
mortality ratios for some specific cancer
sites than does the foreign-born population. However, in the Jewish case, the
proportional mortality ratios for the
native-born population tend to be closer
to the standard population than do the
ratios of the foreign-born population.
An interesting finding is that all three
native-born populations have proportional mortality ratios that are somewhat higher for lung cancer and significantly lower for stomach cancer than
do the foreign-born populations. However, the small number of observed
deaths for some of these causes especially for the foreign-born groups must
be considered. An examination of the
proportional mortality ratios by sex provides more information on the relationship between nativity and mortality.
Proportional mortality ratios by sex for
the native- and foreign-born populations of the Irish, Italian, and Jewish
groups are shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4.
Table 2 shows the proportional mortality ratios of the foreign- and nativeborn Irish groups for various causes. For
most major causes of death, there is little difference between the male and female populations with the exception of
diabetes and cirrhosis. For these causes,
the native-born males have a proportional mortality ratio that is lower than

Differential Mortality 17

that of the foreign-born males, while females show a reverse relationship. With
regard to specific cancer sites there is
less similarity between the sexes (Table
2). For lung cancer, the native-born
male population has a proportional
mortality ratio that is less than that of
the foreign-born male population, while
females show a reverse relationship.

The Italian populations show considerable similarity between males and females (Table 3). For most major causes,
both sexes have proportional mortality
ratios that are approximately the same
level and show approximately the same
differences between nativity groups.
One exception is diabetes, where the female proportional mortality ratios are
significantly higher than those of the
males, for both nativity groups. There is
no consistent pattern regarding specific
cancer sites. Leukemia is the only cancer in which the relationship between
the native- and foreign-born groups’
proportional mortality ratios is similar
for males and females. Cancers of the
stomach and the pancreas show a large
difference between the proportional
mortality ratios of the two nativity
groups, but the direction of the relationship is reversed by sex. There is also a
large difference between nativity groups
for lung cancer for females, but not for
males.

For the Jewish populations, males
and females behave similarly for some
major causes, namely heart disease,
stroke, and pneumonia (Table 4). For
cancer and diabetes, the native-born female group has a significantly higher
proportional mortality ratio while there
is little change among the male groups.
For accidents and cirrhosis, the ratio is
higher for native-born males and lower
for native-born females. For specific
cancer sites, the results are somewhat

more consistent. For cancer of the stomach, the native-born Jewish males and
females have a proportional mortality
ratio that is significantly lower than that
of the foreign-born group. For leukemia, the native-born males and females
have a much higher proportional mortality ratio. Females show a significant
difference between nativity groups for
breast and lung cancer; males, for cancer of the pancreas.

INTER-ETHNIC DIFFERENTIALS

Inter-ethnic comparisons are useful
in examining differential mortality. We
therefore considered the proportional
mortality distribution of the three ethnic

- study groups as a whole. For this pur
pose, we combined the -data on the
foreign- and native-born populations
and calculated new proportional mortality ratios. The results are shown in Table
5. The usefulness of this table however is
somewhat limited. The foreign-born
groups are over-represented, as the
numbers of deaths for the native-born
populations are likely to have been understated. As previously noted, the Irish
and Italians, listed as ““American” on
their death certificate, are excluded
from the counts. The members of the
Jewish population who were not buried
in a Jewish cemetery are excluded, and
this is likely to have a greater effect on
the figures for the native-born population. It is also important to remember
that these figures do not reflect differences in absolute levels of cause-specific
mortality, but in the proportional distribution of mortality by cause.

As indicated in Table 5, the Italian
and Jewish populations exhibit a similar
pattern in proportional mortality ratios
relative to the Irish. This pattern is most
evident for cerebrovascular disease, ac

cidents, pneumonia and influenza, diabetes, cirrhosis, and cancers of the
esophagus, stomach, and leukemia.
Clearly these results are not conclusive as the numbers of the native-born
groups do not represent the entire decedent populations. Nevertheless, the tendency for Italian and Jewish proportional mortality ratios to resemble each
other relative to the Irish ratio occurs often enough to suggest that the Irish
groups studied here have a somewhat
different mortality distribution.

DISCUSSION

The examination of intra- and interethnic differentials in mortality has
yielded few consistent patterns, particularly for the foreign- and native-born
Irish. The proportional mortality ratios
of the native- and foreign-born populations differ widely for most causes of
death, with little variation by sex.

The results for native- and foreignborn Italians show that the proportional
mortality ratios vary little by nativity
groups. With the exception of a few cancer sites, the proportional mortality ratios of the two nativity groups show no
significant differences by cause.

The Jewish proportional mortality
distribution, like that of the Italians, appears relatively stable between nativity
groups (Table 4). Like the Italians,
there are some cancer sites, such as cancer of the stomach and pancreas for
males and breast cancer for females,
where there is a substantial difference
between the foreign- and native-born.
This finding for breast cancer is supported by Seidman (1971) who, in a
study of cancer mortality among ethnic
and religious subgroups in New York
City, 1949-51, found a high mortality
rate for breast cancer among native

born Jewish women between ages 25
and 64, relative to both the foreign-born
Jewish population and the standard
population.

In summary, the data suggest that the
Irish show significant variation in their
proportional mortality ratios by nativity, while the Jewish and Italian populations show more stability across nativity
groups. One explanation may be that
the foreign- and native-born Irish
groups are considerably smaller than the
foreign- and native-born Jewish and
Italian groups. Consequently, proportional mortality ratios for the Irish are
based on a relatively small number of
deaths and may be subject to fluctuation.

The foreign-born Jewish and Italians
may also represent more cohesive immigrant communities. The major immigration of Jews and Italians into New York
City occurred between 1890 and 1923. It
is likely that many of the foreign-born
Italian and Jewish decedents in this
study (all of whom were over 45) entered the United States during this period of massive immigration. Thus,
many of the foreign-born Italians and
Jews immigrated as children, which
would tend to equalize the environmental experience of the foreign- and nativeborn populations of these ethnic groups.
Some supporting evidence for this hypothesis is provided by a study on heart
disease among Jewish and Italian workers over age 50 in the New York garment industry in the 1950’s. The study
reported that approximately 90 per cent
of the women and 80 per cent of the men
in both ethnic groups had been born in
Europe but had lived in the United
States for more than forty years (Epstein et al., 1957). Although this was a
study of a small population, it may be
representative of the immigrant experi

ence of many of the decedents in the
foreign-born Italian and Jewish groups.

Large-scale immigration movements
such as that into New York during the
period 1890~1923 often produce ethnically cohesive communities in which
community members of different generations and/or nativities may share characteristics affecting morbidity. Unique
linguistic and religious characteristics of
the recent immigrants fostered the development of ethnic enclaves or “‘ghettos” such as the Lower East Side or Little Italy. In such ghettos, foreign- and
native-born residents probably shared
equally in many European-based cultural practices. Both native- and
foreign-born members of these immigrant groups may also have been concentrated in certain occupations, such as
the garment industry, where they may
have been exposed to occupational risk
factors that may affect mortality.

The peak in Irish immigration in the
United States, on the other hand, occurred between 1835 and 1865
(Handlin, 1959, p. 47). By the early
twentieth century, although predominantly Irish neighborhoods still existed
in New York City, they did not serve the
same purposes as did Jewish and Italian
ghettos, as the Irish were no longer a
new group and did not face a language
barrier. Irish neighborhoods were likely
to be less ethnically homogeneous and
to contain relatively fewer foreign-born
than Jewish or Italian neighborhoods. It
is less likely, therefore, that the foreignborn Irish decedents studied here either
entered the United States as children or
lived in Irish communities comprised exclusively of both foreign and nativeborn members. It is not surprising that
the proportional mortality distribution
of foreign- and native-born groups is the
least similar for the Irish who, relative to

24 Rosenwaike and Hempstead

the Jews and Italians in New York City,
are a smaller and less cohesive immigrant group.

Table 5 indicates a relatively unique
pattern of proportional mortality ratios
for the Irish population compared to the
Jewish and Italian groups. As proportional mortality is a relative measure,
excessive proportional mortality ratios
from certain causes must be compensated for by deficient ratios from other
causes. In terms of absolute mortality,
however, the Irish have long been considered a high mortality population. In
fact, a recent analysis of cause-specific
death rates for the same foreign-born
Irish and Italian groups studied here
found that Irish males and females had
age- and cause-specific death rates significantly higher than those of the standard population for almost every major
cause and for many cancer sites (Rosenwaike and Hempstead, 1989). In particular, the Irish had excessive mortality
rates for causes of death associated with
alcohol use, such as cirrhosis of the liver,
pneumonia and influenza, accidents,
and cerebrovascular disease. The proportional mortality distributions for the
Irish groups in the present study are consistent with these conclusions. Therefore, it is likely that the similar pattern
of proportional mortality observed in
the Jewish and Italian populations has
more to do with the uniqueness of the
Irish group’s mortality than with any
strong relationship between the other
two ethnic groups.

CONCLUSIONS

This study found no overall pattern of
association between nativity and mortality but did find several interesting relationships. In summary, the two nativity groups of the Jewish and Italian

Social Biology

populations showed little variation in
the proportional! mortality distributions,
with the exception of several cancer
sites. The Irish population, on the other
hand, had substantially different proportional mortality distributions for the
foreign- and native-born groups, but
there was no discernible pattern. It was
suggested that the relative similarity between the Italian and Jewish nativity
groups, as opposed to the Irish nativity
groups may be a function of the relative
size of these immigrant groups, and the
likelihood that many in the Jewish and
Italian groups immigrated at a younger
age. Native- and foreign-born Jews and
Italians also may have been more likely
than the Irish to live in ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods where the differences between the foreign- and
native-born would be minimized. From
an inter-ethnic standpoint, it was noted
that evidence from the present study
and from previous research suggests
that Irish immigrants and their descendants are, in absolute terms, a high mortality group, and in relative terms, have
particularly high death rates and proportional mortality ratios for causes of
death associated with alcohol use. This
study has provided only minor evidence
of “assimilation” of immigrants to the
mortality pattern of the standard population, but it must be remembered that
the native- and foreign-born study populations were the same age at the same
point in time. Thus, many of the nativeborn are not the children of immigrants
45-84 years old, but rather are the children of still older (or more likely, deceased) persons not included in the
study. If many members of the foreignborn groups immigrated at a young age,
then nativity has only minimal significance. This study has, however, shown
that a number of potentially interesting

relationships exist between nativity,
ethnicity, and mortality.

Desirable avenues for future research include comparing mortality data
on immigrants and native-born members of the same ethnic group in the
United States with data from the countries of origin. Additionally, our hypothesis that ethnic community cohesiveness (e.g., ethnic homogeneity in
Italian and Jewish neighborhoods) affected the similarity of mortality patterns for Italians and Jews could be rigorously tested with a multivariate
