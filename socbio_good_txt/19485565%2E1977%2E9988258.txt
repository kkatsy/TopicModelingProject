Social Class, Familism, Interest in
Children, and Childbearing: A Preliminary
Test of a “Commitment” Model of Fertility

David F. Mitchell and David J. Pratto

Department of Sociology

ABSTRACT: Two recurrent concepts in fertility literature permit prediction of an inverse
relationship between social class and fertility. The commitment to familism refers to the degree
that couples embrace a family-centered style of life over a consumerist or careerist style of life.
Commitment to individual children refers to the emotional and material involvement of parents in
each child they have. Data show that commitment to individual children is negatively related to
fertility, that social class is negatively related to commitment to familism, that social class is
positively related to commitment to individual children, and that commitment to familism and
commitment to individual children account for relationships between class and fertility.

Sociologists who study fertility commonly assume either implicitly or explicitly that married couples, as participants in sociocultural systems, incorporate
values of childbearing and childrearing
into their personal orientations and that
these orientations become important determinants of fertility behavior. This basic
rationale guides social scientists who view
fertility as dependent on such macrovariables as urbanization, race, religion,
and social class. These investigators assume that a modal set of interpretations of
family life exists for each of the broad
social categories they study.

Other investigators characterize such
macro-approaches as expressing a “nature-over-man fatalism” in which human
conduct is seen to be unconsciously “in the
grip of physical, biological and social
forces” (Hill, 1966, pp. 3—4). This second
group of social scientists often chooses to
conceive of fertility as dependent on such
micro-variables as attitudes and husband-wife interaction and communication.

 

A third approach to the study of fertility
assumes that the relationship between
broad social structural conditions, interpretations of those conditions by social
actors, and consequent action is problematic. Social scientists embracing this
last point of view point to wide variations
between attitude and action within the
broad categories studied by those who
subscribe to the macro-approach. They
also point to a lack of appreciation of the
role that structural factors play in the
formation of belief and action by those
who subscribe to the micro-approach. In
this study, hypotheses are tested that
relate fertility, as a dependent variable, to
two micro-level variables (personal orientations) and that relate personal orientations as dependent variables to a socialstructural variable, social class.

THEORETICAL MODEL

Two conceptual themes have occurred
repeatedly in the literature on human fertility. One theme draws attention to the
17

18 Mitchell and Pratto

importance that parents attach to the
presence of children in the nuclear family
unit. The second theme focuses on characteristic types of action parents take on behalf of an individual child. For example,
Judith Blake (1968), in her critique of
Gary Becker’s economic theory of fertility,
suggested that the importance of having
children varies with the opportunity costs
that arise if a couple does have a family.
The notion of a differential orientation to
individual children is noted in her suggestion that parents must raise children according to standards set by others. Such
standards may be high or low depending
on the segment of society that serves as a
childrearing model for the couple.

J. A. Banks (1954) implicitly noted the
two themes when he observed that the
decline in family size among Victorian
middle class couples was partly due to the
greater importance of maintaining status
relative to the importance of numbers of
children in general, and partly to the increasing costs of rearing individual children. David Heer (1968, p. 60) explicitly
recognized the two themes in a discussion
of mortality:

It may be supposed that the pain of bereavement at a child’s death is directly proportional to the amount of emotional energy
the parents have invested in that child.
Therefore, where mortality levels are high,
one might expect the parents in the interest
of self-protection to place relatively little
emotional involvement in any one child.
Since parents have limited amounts of emotional energy, a reduction in mortality, by
encouraging parents to place more libido in
existing children, should reduce their desire
to have an additional child.

The first theme will be called commitment to familism. The second theme will
be called commitment to individual children.

COMMITMENT TO FAMILISM

Ernest W. Burgess and Harvey J.
Locke (1950, p. 527) described a familistic

Social Biology

Orientation according to five well-known
dimensions. They employed the term individualism to refer to a nonfamilistic
orientation and maintained that individualism implied low fertility since, at an
extreme, a person might not marry and
raise a family in order to preserve maximum personal freedom (1950, p. 527).

Reuben Hill (1968, p. 245) proposed
that a familistic orientation is most likely
to be encountered where the activities of
family members are home-centered, in
which the family performs a great number
of functions for its members, and in which
the roles of parents are compatible with
the presence of children. Familism thus
understood is commonly viewed as a rural
phenomenon. William Kephart (1961) has
summarized this traditional argument as
follows:

Traditional familism, in the sense of lineage,
property rights, rejection of outsiders, occupational apprenticeships, complete domination of familial over individual objectives—
such an orientation would seem to have little
place in an urbanized, industrialized society
(p. 506).

Kephart cautioned, however, that there
appear to be strongly-held familistic values In urban American society including
those of home centrality, conjugal love,
and children.

Along this line, Wendell Bell argued
that familism may be characterized by a
set of attitudes and actions including “high
value on family living, marriage at young
ages, a short childless span after marriage,
and child-centeredness . . .” (1968, p.
147). According to Bell, this “conjugal
familism” emerged as an element of modernization along with two other styles of
life: careerism and consumerism (1968,
pp. 146-149). In modern American society, married couples have an opportunity
to blend together in varying proportions a
life style that emphasizes the elements of
home and children, career development,
and consumption of goods and services.

Vol. 24, No. 1

The implication, of course, is that the degree to which conjugal familism is embraced, to the exclusion of the latter two
life styles, the greater the fertility of married couples.

In this paper the focus will be on the
type of familism that emphasizes a
commitment to the conjugal family. Interest centers on the degree to which a
married couple emphasizes having and
rearing children over other expenditures of
emotional and material resources. A high
commitment to familism as understood in
this paper refers to a high valuation by a
married couple of a way of life that places
great importance on the presence of children in the nuclear family unit. A couple
with a highly familistic orientation will
expend “wealth, leisure and energy... on
children and other aspects of family living
. . .” (Bell, 1968, p. 147), whereas a
couple with a nonfamilistic orientation
will expend emotional and material resources on a way of life that is presented as
an alternative mode of living by the larger
social and economic environment. In
American society, alternative modes of
living include the careerist and consumerist life styles described by Bell. It is expected that familistic couples will be more
likely to have children and more likely to
have more children than nonfamilistic
couples.

COMMITMENT TO INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN

The birth of a child demands immediate
action from those persons who are expected to care for it. From the infantcaretaker relationship there emerges a
comparatively strong emotional attachment to and highly valued emotional
rewards from infants, a phenomenon
Joseph B. Tamney identifies as the “appeal of babies” (1966, p. 80). From older
children, parents obtain two _ other
rewards (Tamney, 1966, pp. 84-90). The
first, self-extension, refers to the
projection of unfulfilled ambitions onto

Commitment Model of Fertility

19

children. While economic aspirations are
perhaps the most common projection,
Tamney noted that even death is one kind
of failure that the presence of children, to
parents, might appear to ameliorate. The
second emotional satisfaction that parents
obtain from older children is_ selfexpansion. Self-expansion refers to the
parents’ gain in understanding of the
world through children.

In a cautionary note, Tamney pointed
out that self-extension is realized as a
parental reward only if couples have control over children and only if other activities allow them the time to assist a
child toward the attainment of projected
aspirations (1966, pp. 85-87). Selfexpansion is likely to be realized only if
parents interact with children as equals;
that is, if they interact with children as
friends. The reward of self-extension is
difficult to realize to the degree that
parents lack the necessary control over
their children and the knowledge necessary to aid children toward projected aspirations. Self-expansion as a reward, while
possible with few children, is in general
hard to achieve because friendship
“requires time and effort or interest, which
is a scarce commodity” (Tamney, 1966, p.
88).

The essential point of the above
discussion is that children, although offering a married couple several types of
emotional satisfactions or rewards, are
also costly, both emotionally and materially. The cost of self-extension is great
because a large emotional and material
investment must be made in an individual
child in order to maximize his chances of
actually achieving projected aspirations.
Self-expansion is costly in that friendship
demands a large emotional investment in
another person.

A high commitment to individual children, then, refers to a relatively great
quantity of wealth, leisure, and energy a
married couple expends on an individual

20 Mitchell and Pratto

child. It should be noted that the concept
of commitment to individual children does
not refer only to love or affection for a
child, but also to the kinds of action that
parents feel they should take and intend to
take on behalf of a child. Moreover,
idealization of motherhood, babies, and
children is in no way implied in a high
commitment to individual children. In
general, couples highly committed to individual children may be expected to have
fewer children than couples not highly
committed to individual children.

FERTILITY AND COMMITMENT TYPE

Theoretically, using the concepts of
commitment to familism and commitment
to individual children, one might try to
predict the fertility of any one couple by
employing a simple model that divides
commitment to familism by commitment
to individual children. That is, given a
quantity of emotional and material resources to be invested in childbearing and
childrearing, actual fertility would be determined by what multiple that quantity is
of the resources that will, on the average,
be invested in each individual child.

If fertility should vary by the
commitment to familism and_ the
commitment to individual children as just
described, couples with similar patterns of
commitment may be expected to have
similar childbearing and _ childrearing
preferences. Specifically, highest fertility
is predicted when there is a_ high
commitment to familism and a low
commitment to individual children.
Lowest fertility is predicted when there is
low commitment to familism and a high
commitment to individual children.
Moderate fertility is predicted when there
is high commitment to familism and a high
commitment to individual children or low
commitment to familism and a low
commitment to individual children.

 

Social Biology

SOCIAL CLASS, THE COMMITMENT TO FAMILISM, THE COMMITMENT TO INDIVIDUAL
CHILDREN, AND FERTILITY

If it is assumed that fertility is related to
the commitment to familism and the
commitment to individual children as described in the above discussion, it becomes
necessary to account for variation in each
of the commitment variables. The notion
that expenditures of emotional and material resources may be made in a nonfamilistic direction may be viewed as a
recognition of opportunity costs that arise
if a married couple does have children, as
well as of direct costs of nonfamilistic activity. Blake (1968) suggested that the opportunity costs that occur if children are
added to the nuclear unit vary positively
with social class. Therefore, to the extent
that the commitment to familism is a
reflection of opportunity costs, it may
be hypothesized that commitment to
familism varies inversely with social class.
James Beshers (1962, p. 133) noted that
high status couples must use a portion of
the resources at their disposal to maintain
the symbols of their social rank. He suggested that the easier status symbols may
be copied by those lower in status, the
greater the effort there must be to
maintain symbolic distinction (1962, pp.
131-133).

Thus, in general, a high commitment to
familism may be less common among high
status couples than among low status
couples because the former must devote a
larger quantity of resources to maintain
their relative rank. It should be noted that
high status couples whose rank is not
dependent on easily copied status symbols,
but on ascribed attributes such as family
name, may not conform to the general hypothesis. Middle status couples, who must
at least differentiate themselves from those
lower in status to maintain rank, may also
emulate those segments of society higher
in status. If this two-fold process of status

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 24, No. 1

maintenance occurs, middle class couples
might have the lowest commitment to
familism of all couples.

It is hypothesized that social class will
be positively related to commitment to
individual children. Blake (1968) suggested that parents raise children according to standards set by others; and for high
status couples, standards are likely to be
set by high status segments of society and
will more often than not prescribe long
periods of dependence for children. As a
consequence, high status couples will expend relatively greater quantities of emotional and material resources on each child
they have. Beshers (1962) identified the
motive behind these expenditures as an
attempt to maintain social rank over generations. In general, then, high status parents commit a relatively greater quantity
of resources to every child they have to
help preserve their own and their children’s present and future status.

Clearly, if commitment to familism varies inversely with social status, if commitment to individual children varies

EQ

positively with social status, and if fertility
varies as hypothesized with each of the
commitment variables, a theoretical base
exists for predicting an inverse relationship between social class and fertility, at
least for those couples whose status is
based on achieved symbolic attributes.

The general causal model for predicting
fertility from commitment to familism,
commitment to individual children, and
social class is portrayed in Figure 1 below.
Signs indicate the predicted direction of
relationships. The relationship between
class and fertility is predicted to be found
through commitment to familism and
commitment to individual children and
not expressed directly between class and
fertility.

sample if they were listed in one of three
daily newspapers as having had a baby
over a nine-month period. Because over
99 per cent of births in the area take place
in hospitals, this method of sampling
probably was able to locate most legitimate births in the area. Just over 41 per
cent of all couples who were reported to
have had babies returned questionnaires.

' Responding couples represented a wide

range of socioeconomic characteristics.
Nearly half the sample had only one child;
a third, two children; a seventh, three
children; and the remainder, more than
three children. A majority had used and in
the future intended to use some form of
contraception.

MEASUREMENT OF THE COMMITMENT
VARIABLES

Indicators of commitment.—Although
there are many scales that purport to
measure the concept of familism (see
Straus, 1969; Heller, 1970), none was
found that appeared to measure the concept as it has been defined in this research.
Most scales have been designed to
measure the attributes of familism as described by Burgess and Locke (1950) and
not the “conjugal familism” that is the
subject of the present project. Therefore,
special scales were devised.

Three types of indicators were used to
measure the commitment to familism. One
type of indicator sought to determine how
often husband and wife participated in
activities without their children. The wife
was asked to indicate how many times per
month she, together with her husband,
attended a motion picture, dined at a restaurant, attended club meetings, and attended sporting events. These indicators
are based on the assumption that the
greater the number of activities a couple
takes part in without the children, the
higher their commitment to consumerism

Social Biology

and hence the lower their commitment to
familism.

The second type of indicator by which
the commitment to familism was
measured was attitudinal. The wife was
asked to indicate her degree of agreement
or disagreement with five statements that
were designed to measure the importance
she attached to nonhome activity and the
importance she attached to expenditures
of time and money on goods and services
that are a part of a nonfamilistic way of
life. A sample item is: “It is important for a
married couple to be able to travel.”

The third indicator used to measure the
commitment to familism was the work
record of the wife. It was believed that a
record of considerable work experience
would be indicative of a low commitment
to familism. A work index for each wife
consisted of a full-time and a half-time
component, the former receiving a weight
of two and the latter a weight of one. For
each year of marriage, the number of
months the wife worked full-time times
two was added to the number of months
she worked part-time. These yearly scores
were summed and then divided by the
number of years married to yield a score
that reflected the average yearly work of
the wife.

Two types of indicators were used to
measure the commitment to individual
children. One type consisted of statements
that dealt with the ease with which children could be reared, and the ease with
which an additional child could be added
to the family unit. Some items were especially written for this research, but many
were restatements of comments made by
parents that were reported by Rainwater
(1965). A sample item is: “A couple can
always provide for an additional child.”

A second set of indicators was made up
of statements that dealt with what the wife
thought were “proper” courses of action

that her children should follow as they
grew up Three different questions were
asked two times, once for sons and once
for daughters. The questions concerned
how old a child should be before he/she
marries, how old a child should be before
he/she becomes self-supporting, and how
many years of education should be provided for a child. The two answers to each
question were averaged to yield one response per item.

All commitment to familism and commitment to individual children items were
factor analyzed by the principal components method. The purpose of the factor
analysis was to determine if the items

23

defined more than one dimension, and if
more than one dimension, to identify the
items associated with each. Five factors
were extracted and were rotated to simple
structure by an oblique solution. The rotated loadings are shown in Table 1.
Commitment to Familism I is most
highly loaded on the four activity questions and thus may be viewed as a measure of nonhome activity. Commitment to
Familism II is highly loaded on the five
attitudinal items and appears to measure
in part at least the importance of nonfamilistic activity The items that define
the first factor indicate a high commitment
to familism to the degree that responses

are a smaller rather than a greater number
of activities. To the extent that wives disagree with the items in the second factor,
they may be viewed as expressing a high
commitment to familism. The commitment to familism was measured by these
two scales, hereafter referred to as
Familism I and Familism II.
Commitment to Individual Children I
appears to identify a dimension that measures the perceived emotional difficulty of
raising children. Commitment to Individual Children II identifies a dimension that
appears to measure the length of time that
children are expected to be dependent on
parents. To the extent that wives agree
with the items in the first factor, they may
be viewed as expressing a relatively low
commitment to individual children. The
items that define the second factor indicate
a high commitment to individual children
to the degree that responses are a greater
rather than a lesser number of years.
Commitment to individual children will
be measured by the items in these two
factors, hereafter referred to as Individual
Children I and Individual Children II.
The work index defined a one-item factor
and was ignored in further analysis. Four
factor scores were computed for each case
using factor score coefficients as weights.

THE MEASUREMENT OF FERTILITY

The social scientist is faced with two
problems of validity if he wishes to
measure fertility. One problem is particularly acute when fertility is employed as a
dependent variable in a study that uses a
survey design. In such cases, there is concern with whether or not questions of
family size preference “really” measure the
future childbearing activity of married
couples. This method of questioning is
thought to yield responses that predict the
average fertility of groups more accurately
than it predicts the fertility of individual

 

Social Biology

couples (Kiser,
1957).!

A second problem associated with the
measurement of fertility preferences concerns the form of the question. Ryder and
Westoff (1969) have analyzed responses to
questions of intended, expected, and
“really” wanted family size. They found
that couples gave almost identical answers
to expected and intended questions. They
concluded that asking about ideal family
size (for the average American family) was
of little value unless an ideal was specified
for a particular couple under specific
conditions. There was a relationship between the various questions, however.
They found that each question showed
systematic variation between population
subgroups. Thus, it appears that different
forms of the fertility question, while not
yielding identical] estimates of future fertility, may yield similar rank orders of fertility when comparing population subgroups. The answers to such questions
may be indicative of the shape of a
relationship if not of its absolute parameters.

The measurement problem that arises
from the first dilemma cannot be fully
eliminated. Social scientists must assume
that the fertility of married couples is not
fixed at any point early in marriage, but
varies with changes in their positions in
perception of their social environment.
Thus, questions of fertility preferences
may be predictors of future family size
only if such changes are minimal. The
measurement problem presented by the
second dilemma can be minimized by ex
1967; Westoff et al.,

1 Even this finding is not conclusive. The
Growth of American Families study cited by Kiser
did not study the same couples in 1960 that were
studied in 1955. The conclusion of Westoff et al.
(1957) may be questioned because of the small size of
the sample of couples involved, the historical time,
and the fact that couples were only engaged at the
beginning of the study.

amining the shape of relationships between fertility preferences and other variables, rather than the absolute levels of
fertility yielded by preference-type questions.

Each wife was asked three preferencetype questions which were used to
measure fertility. They were (abbreviated
designations in parentheses):

1. How many children do you want to have?
(desired family size)

2. How many children do you think you will
have when you stop having children? (expected family size)?

On the assumption that family size and
spacing of children are inversely related,
the following question was employed:

3. How many years should there be between
children? (preferred spacing between
children)

RESULTS

To test if fertility varied by commitment
to familism and to individual children as
hypothesized, respondents were classified
into commitment types. The distribution
of each of the four commitment scores was
divided at the median to obtain high and
low distributions for each case. Each respondent was designated as a particular
commitment type by pairing commitment
to familism scores with commitment to
individual children scores. Because each
commitment variable was measured two
ways, commitment type could be determined in four ways, resulting from the
four combinations of the two pairs of indicators; Familism I-Individual Children J;
Familism J-Individual Children I;
Familism II-Individual Children I; and

2 In the questionnaire this item was preceded by
the question, “How old do you think you will be
when you stop having children?”

Commitment Model of Fertility

 

25

Familism IJ-Individual Children II. The
mean fertility of respondents within each
type was then calculated.

With few exceptions, fertility varied as
hypothesized with commitment type.
Couples having the lowest fertility (or
longest spacing) preferences were those
highly committed to individual children
and not highly committed to familism.
Couples having the highest fertility (or
shortest spacing) preferences were those
not highly committed to individual children and highly committed to familism.
Other couples had intermediate fertility
preferences (see Tables 2, 3, 4). In only
one instance did the ordering of preferences fail to conform to the hypothesis.

Of the twelve tests of the hypothesis
presented in Tables 2, 3, and 4, eleven
support it. Thus, a sign test suggests that
the null hypothesis can be rejected.

Statistical significance of these results
was also assessed with an unweighted
means analysis of variance. It will be
recalled that fertility preferences were expected to be dependent on_ both
commitment to familism and commitment
to individual children. As reported in
Tables 2 and 3, the main effects of the
commitment variables were generally
significant for size preferences. Only two
of the sixteen tests failed to yield a value
for F that was not significant. As shown in
Table 4, however, only two of the eight
tests for main effects on spacing preferences were statistically significant. It is to
be remembered that a somewhat different
classification of cases resulted from the
four pairings of the commitment scales.
The consistent ordering of means and significant mean differences, at least for size
preferences, is therefore remarkable.

The hypothesis also stated that fertility
preferences are not completely predicted
by either commitment to familism or
commitment to individual children alone.

are consistently small, although there is a
relationship between familism and fertility. Familism JI path coefficients are
consistently higher than Familism I coefficients. Path coefficients from social
class to commitment to individual children
are higher for Commitment to Individual
Children II than for Commitment to Individual Children I. Path coefficients from
commitment to individual children to fertility are higher for Commitment to Individual Children I than for Commitment to
Individual Children II. The strongest path
from social class to fertility is clearly
through commitment to individual children. Because of the lower paths found
from class to familism, none of the path
analyses correspond exactly to the model.
Of these twelve analyses, the one that
most closely corresponds to the hypothesized relationships is presented in Figure
2. From Figure 2 it can be seen that when
using Commitment to Familism II,

the variables in the model, findings are
most isomorphic with the model.

The purpose of using path analysis in
this paper is to test a theoretical model and
not construct a model. For this reason,
alternate causal models suggested by the
path coefficients are not being given extended attention. It may be noted, however, that Commitment to Familism I, a
measure of familism based on actual reported nonhome activity, yields lower
path coefficients to fertility than does
Familism II, a measure based on perceived importance of nonfamilistic activity. Commitment to Individual Children I,
a measure of commitment to individual
children based on perceived ease of raising many children, yields higher path
coefficients to fertility than Commitment
to Individual Children II, a measure based
on expected length of socialization.
Commitment to the Individual Children II,
however, is more strongly related to class
than to fertility. Until the validity of the
commitment indicators are more fully es

tablished, proposing alternative causal
models is not recommended. As stated
earlier, the overall isomorphism of the
data with the model is of more importance
than a detailed analysis of the magnitude
of the obtained paths. The isomorphism
found in this analysis is certainly suggestive enough to warrant further testing and
elaboration of the model with other indicators or modifications of the indicators
described here.

DISCUSSION

The commitment model of fertility that
has been stated and tested in this paper
appears to be a potentially useful framework for viewing family-building in modern societies. Commitment to individual
children has been shown to be the primary
“operator” through which social class is
causally linked to fertility (Heise, 1975),
although both commitment variables are
related to fertility.

The commitment model clearly predicts
a negative relationship between class and
fertility, a relationship that a number of
social scientists might dispute. Hawley
(1950, pp. 114-119), for example, has
predicted a positive relationship between
class and fertility as the demographic
transition comes to an end. Wrong (1958)
has noted several possible post-transition
relationships including U-shaped, reversed J-shaped, and positive. The
commitment model predicts an inverse
relationship by making the assumption, on
the one hand, that opportunities for nonfamilistic life styles are limited for populations of low occupational and educational
rank, and on the other hand, that childrearing standards are relatively low for
these same populations. Highly ranked
populations are subject to just the opposite
set of constraints. If childrearing standards, and if opportunities to take up
careerist and consumerist life styles are

Commitment Model of Fertility 29

equal for all populations, then, of course,
a pronounced inverse relationship would
not be expected.

To the extent that modernization has in
fact equalized opportunities and childrearing standards, the commitment model is in
no way inconsistent with known data and
may account partially for the weak relationship between fertility and class in the
above data. But one should not assume
that modernization will bring about a full
equalization of opportunities for nonfamilistic activity and childrearing standards. The latter may remain quite variable to the former. If it does, there will
continue to be a negative relationship between class and fertility, although a
weaker one than would be expected if opportunities were not equal.

In any event, commitment to familism
and commitment to individual children
are related to variables other than class and
therefore could produce differential fertility even in a perfectly egalitarian society.
The number of variables causally related
to fertility, such as religion, race, urbanization, and age, demand a more exhaustive causal interpretation of fertility using
the commitment variables than presented
here. Of importance in this analysis is the
picture derived about the relationship between fertility and social class. The
analyses presented here suggest that class
is related to fertility through commitment
to individual children.

In future analysis, the commitment
model should be examined with macrovariables other than class. For example,
the variable of race, long important to social demographers, needs to be examined
in the context of the model. Goldscheider
and Uhlenberg (1969) have suggested that
the desire for acculturation by some
minority groups is instrumental in lowering fertility, at least if acculturation appears possible at all. The extremely low
fertility and high rates of childlessness reDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

ported for middle status Black couples
may be a function of large quantities of
resources invested in adaptation, implying
a low commitment to familism. The large
quantity of resources demanded by each
child, if added to the family, implies a
high commitment to individual children
for these couples. The data confirmed that
it is just this pattern of commitment that is
predictive of lowest fertility.

The commitment model also may be
useful for understanding just how family
size preferences change as movement
through the family life cycle takes place.
Thompson and Ilsley (1969) and Rainwater (1965) have demonstrated that family
size preferences change during the course
of married life, most often in a downward
direction. Whether these revisions are
primarily related to changes in the commitment to familism or commitment to
individual children, or both, could be

Social Biology

made clear through carefully designed
longitudinal studies. Such studies could
determine how much the commitment
variables are dependent on actual family
size. Within the limits imposed by
macro-variables, commitment to familism
and individual children may vary considerably as family life is continually redefined at the addition of each child.

In summary, the concepts of commitment to familism and commitment to individual children may be instrumental in
clarifying many anomalous relationships
between fertility and other variables
which have perplexed demographers for
some time.
