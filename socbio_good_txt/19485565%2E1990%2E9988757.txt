ABSTRACT: Data from the 1981~82 Nigeria Fertility Survey (NFS) are used to identify the key
proximate determinants of fertility in Nigeria. The patterns of their individual and collective
effects are analyzed in a search for possible sources of fertility change. Exposure to the risk of
childbearing through first marriage is found to be the most important proximate determinant of
Nigerian fertility. Subsequent to marriage, fertility is determined mainly by breastfeeding and
postpartum sexual abstinence. Where fertility shows significant socioeconomic variations,
there are equally identifiable patterns of the impact of the proximate determinants which
explain these differentials to a large extent. On a national scale, the observed patterns of the
impact of the measured proximate determinants do not appear to suggest that Nigerian fertility

is soon to experience a large decline.

With an estimated population of
about 110 million in 1990, Nigeria is by
far the most populous country in Africa.
The national population is highly differentiated with respect to geographical
distribution, sociocultural characteristics, and economic development. There
are 21 states in the country which fall
into four geographical regions: NorthEast, North-West, South-East, and
South-West. These regions reflect,
though imperfectly, broad sociocultural, economic, and demographic characteristics. The two southern regions are
mainly Christian, more educated, more
Westernized, and more economically
advanced than the two predominantly
Muslim northern regions. About 80 per
cent of the population lives in rural areas. Although no exact figure is available, it is generally believed that the national population is roughly equally
distributed between the North and the
South and is growing at a rate of around
3.5 per cent per annum. The current national total fertility rate is 6.4.

The proximate determinants of fertility which are relevant to this analysis include the proportion of women ever
married, the proportion of women currently married, postpartum amenorrhoea, postpartum sexual abstinence,
lactational infecundity, contraception,
induced and spontaneous abortions,
natural and pathological sterility, and
frequency of intercourse. However, because of data limitations, not all of these
variables are measured for their direct
effects on fertility.

Data from the Nigeria Fertility Survey (NFS) (NFS Report, Vol. 1, 1984)
show that marriage is still early and universal in Nigeria, and that once married,
women spend only a small proportion of
time outside marriage. On the average,
Nigerian women are amenorrhoeic for
10.4 months, abstain for 14.1 months,
and breastfeed for 16.3 months in the
last closed birth interval. Current use
rate of modern contraception among fecund, non-pregnant married women is
just 6.2 per cent.

The background variables which are
analyzed with the proximate determinants are age of the respondent, female
and husband education, and region and
type of place of current residence. The
choice of these variables is based on
their importance for fertility levels and
on availability in the NFS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
FERTILITY EXPOSURE ANALYSIS

Fertility Exposure Analysis (FEA)
decomposes the overall fertility of an individual woman into its proximate determinants or their quantifiable surrogates within a defined time interval. A
woman is assigned a given state or states
each month in the interval under observation using a defined hierarchy among
the states. In a given interval, a woman
could be pregnant (p), never married
(m), not in union (u), infecund following a confinement (i), breastfeeding a
baby (J), using contraception (c), or exposed to the risk of having a pregnancy
(r). The contribution of a particular
state for each woman in the reference
period is derived by dividing the sum of
the proportion of the time interval spent
in each state by the length of the reference period. The additive form of the
model is,

F = d(p)I(d(p) + d(t) + d(r))
. (1-d(m)-d(u)-d(c)-(D) (1)

where F = potential fertility and p,i,r,
m,u,c and I are as defined above. d(p)/
(d(p) + d(i) + d(r) = observed fertility, net of the reducing effects of the
proximate determinants or states m,u,c
and /; d(m), d(c) and d(l) are the reductions due to the individual states. The
model can also be stated in a multiplicative form as,

Fertility in Nigeria 163

F = d(p)/(d(p) + d(i) + d(r)).
C(m)C(ulm)C(cilmu)C(limuc); (2)

C(m) = reducing effect of marriage,
C(u/m) = reducing effect of union instability,
C(c/mu) = reducing effect of contraception, and,
C(i/muc) = reducing effect of breast
feeding on fertility.

The observed fertility (f) for each individual is,

(12/9).d(p) (3)

where d(p) is the proportion of time
spent pregnant in the observation interval. The potential fertility (F), or fertility net the effects of the proximate determinants, is calculated as the ratio of
the time spent pregnant to the time
spent unprotected by any of the identified determinants; thus,

F = 12/9(d(p)/d(p) + d(i) + d(r)). (4)

For regression analysis, the mean “f’s
and “‘F’’s in (3) and (4) for the reproductive ages (15-49) are multiplied by the
length of the reproductive age range to
produce an approximate measure of the
observed and potential total fertility
rates.

Some adaptations of FEA are made
in the allocation of protective probabilities due to breastfeeding and contraception. Postpartum non-susceptible period is broken into its lactational and
non-lactational components and the impact of postpartum sexual abstinence on
fertility is measured separately. It is considered that what might have been recorded as herbs and “‘others” in the Nigerian Fertility Survey could have
included a variety of mildly effective
folk methods such as concoctions prepared by local medicine men (see Bradley and Gille, 1981); hence the generous

allocation of 0.3 to each as their probable degree of protection from contraception (Table 1).

There are not enough data of sufficient quality in the NFS with which to
estimate internally the probability of
protection by method accurately. Apart
from sterilization and IUD’s whose efficacies are not dependent on accurate
application on the part of the user, it is
possible that the probabilities in Table 1
overstated protection from the risk of
pregnancy due to contraception among
Nigerian women. For lack of detailed information on contraceptive use on a
monthly basis, it is assumed that current
users used the current method throughout the open interval.

The proportion of women who never
breastfed in the NFS data is too small to
allow estimates of protection probabilities due to breastfeeding to be made endogenously with the examination of the
relationship between the duration of
postpartum amenorrhoea and breast

feeding duration. A schedule produced
with Egyptian data (Nawar and Hobcraft, 1986) is adjusted upwards at very
long durations for Nigeria based on the
comparison of breastfeeding habits in
the two countries, and following suggestions that fertility-inhibiting effects of
breastfeeding beyond menstruation
might have been underestimated in past
studies (Guz and Hobcraft, 1990). A
woman is assumed to be sterile if she
was fully exposed to the risk of conception in the three years of observation but
had no pregnancy. An elaborate stratification which measures fecundity by the
fertility performance of a woman within
a given interval in the past is not carried
out because it has been found to make
only small differences in results.

Reported pregnancies in the selected
interval are used to estimate fertility.
This is likely to underestimate fertility
because pregnancies, especially at very
early durations, are often underreported in retrospective surveys. Since
pregnancies are converted into births
before their outcomes are known, this is
likely to overstate fertility because not
all pregnancies will end in live births.
Hence, the possible downward bias introduced by any omission of pregnancies is likely to be compensated for by
the absence of adjustment for pregnancy wastage.

Using the additive model of FEA,
Equation (1) is restated with a separate
effect of post partum abstinence as,

F = d(p)l(d(p) + d(i) + d(r))
. (1-d(m)-d(u)-d(c)-d()-d(a)) (5)

where d(a) = the reduction in fertility
due to post partum abstinence. All abstinence durations for the three most recent births which fall within the observation window are included in the analysis.
For the women who were still abstaining

at the time of the interview, the number
of months since the last birth is assigned
for abstinence in the open interval. The
impact of abstinence is assessed after
those of all other postpartum states. An
implication of this hierarchy which
needs to be pointed out is that the level
of fertility reduction due to abstinence
which is presented in the results cannot
be an overestimation.

The results shown in Tables 2
through 6 refer to the three most recent
years before the NFS and are for “sterile
stratification” as already defined. Data
for all 9,727 cases in the Standard Recode file of the NFS are used; hence the
number of cases for each variable category in the results are reasonably large,
even in instances where analysis is restricted to particular exposure types.

Two additional sets of measures
which throw more light on the determinants of variations in Nigerian fertility
are computed. These are (1) the proportion of women who are sterile in the selected interval, which only approximately measures fecundability, and (2)
the mean waiting time to conceive by
women who are not sterile. The mean
waiting time to conceive (in months) for

fecund women for a given age or other
variable group is estimated as,

9d(r)/d(p) (6)

where d(r) = the proportion of months
at risk, and d(p) = the proportion of
months in which there is no conception.
With the substantive bias of this paper, several methodological issues in
FEA (Pullum, 1987; Hobcraft, 1987;
Pullum et al., 1987) are not pursued.

RESULTS
OBSERVED AND POTENTIAL FERTILITY

A total fertility rate of 5.9 is estimated for all Nigeria in the 1-36 months
before the survey (Table 2). This fertility level is lower than a value of 6.3 estimated for the most recent five years in
the Principal Report of the survey. The
difference might be related to reporting
errors which are known to have depressing effects on reports of births and pregnancies for most recent 2—3 years in retrospective surveys. The data in Table 2
and Table 3 show some variations in the
estimate observed total fertility rates by
age and background variables. The rates

in each category are unadjusted and are
more likely to have been affected by
confounding factors than the values in
Table 5, and thus should be interpreted
with some caution.

In Table 5, estimates of marital fertility show no deviation from an expected
age-pattern. The net effect of type of
place of residence on marital fertility is
small, although rural level is higher. No
strong dampening effect of education on
fertility is observed below secondary
schooling. As would be expected, marital fertility is lowest for women with secondary or higher education. There is
only a slight difference between the
marital fertility for women whose husbands have either primary education
only and secondary or higher education.
The interesting point here is that the two
high husband-education categories (primary, sec. +) show levels of marital fertility which suggest that husband’s education may not necessarily be acting in
the same direction as a woman’s own education does on fertility.

Social Biology

A potential total fertility rate of 14.23
estimated for Nigeria appears to be
within a reasonable range although it is
1.08 TFR lower than the value which is
usually assumed in the Bongaarts’
model (see Bongaarts, 1978; Bongaarts
and Potter, 1983). In other applications
of FEA, varied levels of potential TFR’s
have been estimated which generally
tend to be lower than Bongaarts’ model
value of 15.3. A value of 15.1 was estimated for the Dominican Republic
(Hobcraft and Little, 1984), 14.3 for the
Republic of Korea (Little and Hobcraft,
1984), 12.6 for Egypt (Nawar and Hobcraft, 1983), and 15.3 and 11.7 for
Kenya and Sudan _ respectively
(Chimere-Dan, 1989).

Variations in potential fertility (Table 3) should be small in the absence of
errors and if all proximate determinants
were included in the model. With the
exception of the South-East, regional
variations in potential fertility are not
large. It is not surprising that potential
fertility is slightly lower in the urban ar

eas. This could be reflecting the omission of some relevant proximate determinants. One of such is reduced coital
frequency arising from spousal separation due to working or schooling patterns of couples. Another reason for the
observed lower urban potential fertility
might lie in possible omission of induced
abortion, the practice of which is likely
to be more widespread in the urban areas.

FERTILITY REDUCTION BY THE
PROXIMATE DETERMINANTS

The data in the five central columns
of Table 2 show the estimated percentage reduction of potential age-specific
and total fertility rates by each proximate determinant. In total, fertility in
Nigeria 1s reduced by 58.5 per cent from
its potential level by the proximate factors which are measured in the present
analysis. Exposure reduction due to being outside marriage is the single most
important determinant of fertility level.
Never-married state accounts for as
much as a quarter of all reduction in fertility for all women.

Breastfeeding is the second most important proximate determinant, accounting for a 15.8 per cent reduction in
fertility while postpartum sexual abstinence ranks third in the major fertility
determinants with a 13.3 per cent reduction in fertility. Marital instability and
contraception are of a relatively minor
consequence for fertility level once the
impacts of marriage, breastfeeding, and
abstinence have been assessed.

The contribution of contraception to
fertility reduction shows some slight rise
at old age. This suggests that at these advanced ages, many women who use contraception might be doing so in order to
stop, rather than to space childbearing.
A cultural impetus for such a practice

Fertility in Nigeria 167

may be the norm in most Nigerian communities which expects women who
have reached particular social ages
(e.g., grandmothers) to stop childbearing.

At the peak and other important
childbearing age groups, breastfeeding
and postpartum sexual abstinence show
quite strong effects. No large differentials are observed in the age pattern of
marital fertility reduction due to these
two proximate determinants until the
last childbearing age groups.

Not being married and contraception
reduce fertility more in the South than in
the North of Nigevia while breastfeeding
reduces fertility more in the North than
in the South. There is a fairly uniform
pattern of fertility reduction due to postpartum sexual abstinence in all regions
except in the South-East where a relatively lower impact is observed. The
dampening impact of marital instability
is greater in the South-East region.

The most obvious rural-urban differentials in fertility reduction by the proximate determinants are for marriage and
abstinence effects, although contraception shows significantly more fertilityreducing impacts in the urban areas.

The negative effect on fertility of being unmarried increases with educational achievement, as would be expected. Marriage disruption contributes
most to fertility reduction among the uneducated women. Contraception shows
a comparatively strong fertilityreducing effect among the most educated group. Beyond Koranic level of
education, the power of breastfeeding
to reduce fertility is inversely related to
educational status of women. A similar
inverse relationship is observed between the fertility-reducing effects of
postpartum sexual abstinence and formal education.

Estimates of the mean waiting times
to conceive and the proportion sterile
for women aged 20-29 are shown in Table 3 by background characteristics.
Women in the 20-24 and 25-29 age
groups wait on the average for just over
a year and 14.5 months, respectively, to
conceive. It is noticed that Northern fecund women wait longer to conceive
than their counterparts in the South.
There is also a tendency for the more educated women to conceive quicker.

It should be recalled that sterility is
here operationally defined as absence of
a conception for any woman who was
fully exposed to the risk of a pregnancy
throughout the three-year interval. Although this length of time is about ideal,
some women might go on to conceive after three years. Therefore, the sterility
results in Table 4 do not show, with absolute certainty, the levels and patterns
of primary sterility in Nigeria. The picture which they present, however, is not

 

misleading, especially when viewed together with the evidence on sterility
from other sources (e.g., Udjo, 1987).
There are more sterile women in the
Northern regions than in the Southern
regions, more in rural than urban areas,
and higher educational achievement is
associated with low level of sterility.

DISCUSSION

With the data in Table 5, it is easier to
see the proximate causes of socioeconomic and age variations in fertility. At
the peak of the childbearing age group
(24-29), abstinence and breastfeeding
have strong negative impacts on fertility
(15.1 and 21.5 per cent, respectively),
while contraception has the least negative impact (0.3 per cent). Should the
durations of breastfeeding and abstinence shorten, however slightly, the fertility reaction is most likely to be a rise.

The very low marital fertility at the
oldest age groups appears to be a result
of a high rate of marital disruption (possibly due to spousal death) and quite a
substantial use of contraception to terminate, rather than space, childbearing.
For this oldest age group, the implications of the operations of the proximate
determinants are not too important any
way since the impact of the menopause
is decisive.

Relatively, the only apparent check
of marital fertility in the North-East is
postpartum sexual abstinence. Both
postpartum abstinence and breastfeeding are strong depressants of marital fertility in the North-West. In the SouthEast, marital instability has quite a high

dampening effect on fertility, and it appears that women in this region are increasingly substituting traditional norms
of childbearing with the use of modern
contraception. In the South-West, both
breastfeeding and abstinence will show
relatively strong impact on marital fertility.

It is clearer from these results why
small differentials exist between rural
and urban marital fertility in Nigeria. In
the urban area, fertility would tend to
rise due to relatively weak impacts of
breastfeeding and abstinence. On the
other hand, marital disruption and contraception appear to depress fertility in
the urban areas. The exact opposite of
this pattern is observed for the rural areas: Breastfeeding and abstinence depress fertility more, while the negative
impacts of marital disruption and contraception are small. These patterns
would have some cancelling effects on
the overall rural and urban fertility differentials in Nigeria. However, it seems
that the depressing effects on urban fertility are weaker on balance, hence the
tendency for it to rise and produce the
current pattern of near convergence
with rural fertility.

The erosion of traditional norms of
childbearing in Nigeria is apparent in
the pattern of the proximate determinants among the educational categories.
The impact of postpartum abstinence
shows an inverse relationship with formal (i.e., excepting Koranic) education.
Breastfeeding and contraceptive impacts on fertility are also inversely related to formal education. As would be
expected, the reducing effects of contraception show a positive relationship
with husband education. Abstinence,
breastfeeding, and marital instability
show an expected inverse relationship
with husband education, although with

less consistency than is observed for the
respondent’s own education.

The results of the present analysis
confirm the dominant impacts of breastfeeding and postpartum sexual abstinence on Nigerian marital fertility as can
be seen in Table 6. The size of their individual impacts on fertility suggest that
breastfeeding and abstinence might
have had roughly equal depressing effects on fertility in the past. In recent
times, the practice of long durations of
breastfeeding and postpartum sexual
abstinence have come under increasing
pressures to adapt to modernization.
Significant reduction in the duration of
either or both of these proximate determinants will result in fertility rises unless
contraceptive use prevails at an equal or
higher degree.

CONCLUSION

It seems that, in the near future, the
level and trend of fertility in Nigeria will
be largely determined by the trend in
age at entry into first marriage, duration
of breastfeeding, and postpartum sexual
abstinence. Familiar and expected patterns of variations are observed in the
impact of some background variables on
fertility via these proximate determiDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

nants. In effect, a decline in national fertility, when it sets in, is likely to be a reaction of the proximate determinants to
the impacts of the more remote or modernization variables.

Considered alongside the current
knowledge about other aspects of
fertility-related behavior in Nigeria, the
available data do not suggest a clear tendency toward fertility decline. Although
there are some indications of a rising age
at first marriage, the evidence is still
confined to a small subgroup of the population, mainly in the South. Changes
identified for breastfeeding and postpartum sexual abstinence appear to be in favor of a slightly rising fertility, at least in

the short run. Presently, contraception
is not a powerful proximate determinant
of fertility in Nigeria. This scenario
promises anything but an imminent substantial national fertility decline. To offset the observed potential for rises in
fertility, and to go on to initiate a nationwide large decline in fertility require, indeed a revolution in the practice of modern contraception by Nigerian couples.
