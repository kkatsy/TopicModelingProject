ABSTRACT: The use of neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates as proxies for endogenous and
exogenous mortality rates is common in demographic and epidemiological research. The
results reported in this paper suggest that such a practice is not entirely valid and that, perhaps,
a reformulation of the operational definition of the neonatal mortality rate is in order. The study
shows that day-specific endogenous mortality rates predominate during the first eighteen days
of life and that curves representing the patterning of day-specific endogenous and exogenous
mortality rates converge at about the 18th day and not at about the 28th day. The study also
warrants against the use of the postneonatal mortality rate, as currently defined, as a proxy for
exogenous mortality. Of all classifiable infant deaths occurring between the 19th and the 365th
day, less than half (44.5 per cent) are due to exogenous causes. The matched birth and death
data from New Mexico used for this study are shown to correspond rather closely in neonatal
and infant mortality rates to data from Georgia and New York City, indicating that to a large

extent the results of this study may be generalized to other states.

Studies of infant mortality frequently
categorize infant deaths according to
those due to natal and antenatal factors
(i.e., endogenous causes) and those due
to environmental factors (i.e., exogenous causes). This distinction is made
owing to the realization that deaths arising from the former set of causes are
those aver which “‘even the best health
services have comparatively little control” (Thompson and Lewis, 1965, p.
356). In an attempt to represent the endogenous — exogenous distinction, researchers often use neonatal and
postneonatal mortality rates. Neonatal
mortality typically refers to deaths to individuals under 28 days of age, whereas
postneonatal mortality refers to deaths
to individuals at 28 to 364 days of age
(Shryock and Siegel, 1976, p. 236). This

strategy, of course, operates under the
assumption that, within the first year,
endogenous causes of death occur
mainly during the first 28 days of life.
This paper examines empirically the
above assumption. Using a nearcomplete set of matched birth and death
certificates for the years 1974 through
1977 for the state of New Mexico, we coded the death records according to ehdogenous and exogenous causes using
the Eighth Revision International Classification of Diseases, Adapted for Use in
the United States (National Center for
Health Statistics, 1967). Deaths due to
endogenous and exogenous causes were
then examined separately according to
day of death. Our analysis suggests that
if neonatal mortality is used as a proxy
for deaths due mainly to endogenous

causes, its operationalization needs to
be narrowed from deaths occurring during the first four weeks of life. Our study
also suggests that there is no valid approximation for postneonatal mortality.

In the next section of this paper we
review some of the basic demographic
and medical literature pertaining to neonatal and postneonatal mortality and to
endogenous and exogenous causes of infant death. Later sections present discussions of the New Mexico set of
matched birth and death data, an analysis of these data according to day of
death, and a discussion about revising
the temporal definition of neonatal mortality.

NEONATAL AND
POSTNEONATAL INFANT
MORTALITY

In vital statistics research, an infant is
a person less than twelve months of age,
or, more precisely, less than 365 days
old. However, over time researchers
have used the term in a number of ways.
The world “infant” originates in the
Latin words in, which means “‘not,” and
fans, which means “‘speaking” (Blakiston’s Gould Medical Dictionary, 1979).
Originally, infant denoted an individual not yet old enough to speak. In
medical terminology infant first applied
to an individual under 2 years, or in
some cases, under 18 months old (Skinner, 1970, p. 225).

A death, according to the Statistical
Commission of the United Nations, is
defined as:

the permanent disappearance of all
evidence of life at any time after live birth
has taken place (post-natal cessation of
vital functions without capability of resuscitation). This definition therefore ex
   

Poston and Rogers

Social Biology

 

   

cludes foetal deaths (United Nations,
1955, Series F, No 7, p 53):

By definition then a death, and this
includes an infant death, will only follow
a live birth.

The neonatal and postneonatal divisions have been employed in the study
of infant mortality for some time, and
many researchers have used them as
proxies for endogenous and exogenous
mortality (for examples, see Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977, pp. 455456; Jiobu, 1972, p. 604; Markides and
Barnes, 1977, p. 38, and Pharoah and
Morris, 1979, p. 170; for additional discussion, see also Bogue, 1969, p. 588;
Bouvier and van der Tak, 1976, p. 5,
and Shryock and Siegel, 1976, p. 232).
Actually, the operational definitions of
neonatal and postneonatal mortality are
probably based more on statistical convenience than biological fact. Indeed,
Bourgeois-Pichat (1951, p. 3) noted
more than thirty years ago that the upper bound of infant mortality had its
grounds more in calendrical than biological events. It is not unlikely that the
same observation may be made regarding neonatal and postneonatal mortality.

In this paper, we examine the degree
to which neonatal mortality serves as a
proxy for endogenous mortality and
postneonatal mortality for exogenous
mortality. According to current definitions, neonatal mortality includes all
mortality within the first 28 days of life,
and postneonatal mortality all mortality
within 28 days through 364. Neonatal
mortality has been used as a proxy for
endogenous mortality because it has
been thought that most of the deaths occurring during the first four weeks of life
have been due to natal and antenatal
factors, such as immaturity, postnatal

asphyxia, birth injuries, and congenital disorders. Conversely, postneonatal
mortality has frequently been employed
as a substitute for exogenous mortality
owing to the assumption that deaths occurring within days 28 through 364 are
primarily due to environmental factors
such as infections, parasitic diseases,
and postnatal accidents. It has also been
noted that exogenous risks are more
easily changed through increased education, medical technology, and nutrition,
while endogenous mortality is more resistant to scientific developments (Shryock and Siegel, 1976, p. 232).

While many demographers still use
the neonatal/endogenous vs. postneonatal/exogenous dichotomy, Bogue, for
one, has analyzed the distribution of
death by age, over time, and has questioned the use of neonatal mortality as
the best indicator of endogenous causes
of death. He has observed that “‘the endogenous factors dominate infant mortality only for the first three or possibly
four days and that during the remainder
of the first month exogenous factors are
just as important as during the last 11
months” (Bogue, 1969, p. 588). Although Bogue’s critique of neonatal
mortality is plausible, his data, unfortunately, were not detailed enough to pinpoint precisely the time period where
the split between endogenous and exogenous mortality actually occurs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In an attempt to analyze differences
in endogenous and exogenous causes of
death, we have developed a data set
comprised of matched birth and death
records of individuals less than 365 days
of age who were born in the state of New
Mexico in the years 1974 through 1977.

Neonatal Mortality Rate 3

Although New Mexico ts but one state
in the United States, we will show later
the similarities between the mortality
experiences of this state and other

- United States aggregates. We will argue

that the results for New Mexico are generalizable to other United States populations.

We selected birth certificate records
from 1974 through 1977 and infant
death certificate records from 1974
through 1977, along with those deaths
which occurred in 1978 to infants born in
1977. Thus, only those deaths were selected which corresponded to the population of births which were at risk of
death. We acquired 87,724 resident
births and 1,438 infant deaths and were
able to match 95 per cent of the births
with their respective infant deaths.

We next coded the infant deaths according to endogenous and exogenous
causes of death from the Eighth Revision International Classification of Diseases, Adapted for Use in the United
States (ICDA). Since the ICDA code
sections are not organized by endogenous and exogenous causes, each code
had to be determined separately. We
used, as our criteria, the definitions of
Shryock and Siegel. They state that endogenous mortality arises from the “genetic makeup of the individual and from
the circumstances of prenatal life and
birth process” (1976, p. 232). Endogenous infant mortality includes immaturity, birth injuries, and postnatal asyhyxia. Exogenous mortality arises from
environmental or external causes and
includes infections and accidents (Shryock and Siegel, 1976, p. 232). Most
unknown or ill-defined codes were excluded from the analyses, (e.g., ICDA
795, Sudden Death), although these exclusions were not at all numerous. They

amounted to 14 per cent of all infant
deaths. Most of the excluded codes were
sudden infant deaths, or ICDA 795 (86
per cent), and “other ill-defined and unknown causes of morbidity and mortality,” or ICDA 796 (12 per cent).

The coding assignments of endogenous and exogenous causes of death
from the ICDAS8 codes are presented in
Table 1. One may observe that our coding of endogenous and exogenous
causes was facilitated by the major
ICDA8 divisions. While there are 17
major ICDA8 divisions, the infant
death codes in our data set comprise
only nine divisions (the other codes are
essentially causes of morbidity, not mortality, or are causes of death not usually
affecting infants, like complications of
pregnancy relating to the mother). The
primary goal here is to provide an accurate, workable coding scheme for our
data set. The secondary goal is to provide a “prototype” from which other
studies can adapt and similarly study endogenous and exogenous mortality. For
these reasons we have not coded each
ICDA8 entry as endogenous or exogenous; instead, we have coded only the
actual data entries in our data set. Table
1 lists all causes of death covered by the
ICDA8 codes in our data set and our
coding decision for each of them.

RESULTS

As discussed earlier, we have available for analysis nearly 1,400 infant
deaths for New Mexico for the years
1974 through 1977 classified by age at
death in days (0 to 364) and whether the
death was due to an endogenous or exogenous cause. We computed, without
regard to year of occurrence, a schedule
of day-specific endogenous mortality

Social Biology

rates and a similar schedule of exogenous rates.

As noted earlier, many users of the
neonatal mortality rate assume that the
deaths occurring during the first four
weeks of life are caused more by endogenous then exogenous factors. If this assumption is tenable, then a plot of dayspecific endogenous and exogenous
mortality rates should show that the endogenous rates converge with the exogenous rates at about the 27th day.

In Figure 1 we have assembled such a
plot. Endogenous mortality clearly predominates the first seven days of life; the
rates are erratic thereafter, and convergence occurs and reoccurs between days
7 and 21.

The endogenous mortality rates determine the trend of total mortality.
They begin high, fall sharply, and then
remain low throughout the rest of the
year. About 72 per cent of all mortality
is comprised of endogenous mortality.
Exogenous mortality is low throughout
the year. In fact, the exogenous mortality rate by day never exceeds 2 deaths
per 10,000 births. About 14 per cent of
all deaths trougnout the year are exogenous.

There is little evidence in Figure 1
supporting the rationale for using neonatal mortality as a proxy for endogenous mortality. Endogenous mortality is
not prominent over the first four weeks
of life. Its dominance over exogenous
mortality is highlighted mainly, although not continually, during the first
three weeks of life.

Another way of comparing, on a
daily basis, the course of endogenous

‘mortality with that of exogenous mortal
ity is through regression analysis. We
first attempted to fit a curve to the endogenous mortality rates. After experi

menting with linear, parabolic, and hyperbolic functions, the function which
best fit the data was hyperbolic. The
general form of the function was
Y=A+B(X,
where Y = day-specific endogenous mortality rate per 10,000 live births,
X = days lived,
A = asymptote,
B = multiplicative constant, and
C = exponent.

We began with an exponent (C)
equal to 1. Since day 0 is undefined, we
recoded day 0 to day 0.2. Although 0.2
may not actually be the value used, it
more closely approximates the real
value than the value 0. Since an individ
ual cannot die at 0 days, 1.e., before be
ing born, it must die after some fraction
of one day. The value we selected indicates that the average death in the first
24 hours occurs about 5 hours after

birth. This value is reasonable, empirically accurate, and provides the best fit.

The coefficient of determination (R?)
for the endogenous mortality curve was
0.997 and followed the equation

Rate = —0.045 + 11.687/Day.

These data indicate that the risk of a
baby dying of prematurity, congenital
anomalies, and other endogenous
causes immediately after birth, remains
high for several days, and then tapers off
quickly. This pattern is predictable and
consistent, showing little variation.

The exogenous mortality rates fit less
accurately. Since exogenous mortality
occurs from poisonings, homicides, and
accidents, there is probably no one time
during the first year in which an infant is
more prone to deaths from accidents,
except, perhaps, in the first few days of
life. With respect to other exogenous

causes such as infective atid parasitic diseases, since a baby has some antibodies
and immunities immediately after birth,
we would expéct the first 1 or 2 months
to exhibit low exogenous mortality. Further, since through breast feeding an infant can gain additional antibodies and
immunities, we would expect breastfed
babies to be fairly resistant to infections
well into the year. In fitting exogenous
mortality, we first tried a linear equation. Such a line fit poorly (R? = 0.14).
The fit improved slightly with a parabolic function (R? = 0.19). We next
used a hyperbolic function of the form
used with the endogenous mortality
rates. This equation provided the best fit
with a coefficient of determination of
0.46, in the form

Rate = 0.053 + 0.315/Day.

A baby’s probability of dying from exogenous causes of death within the first
year of life is highest in the first days and
then slowly tapers off. The slope is not
as Steep as in the endogenous equation,
meaning that the probability of dying in
day 0 versus any other day is high, but
not substantially so. The lower coefficient of determination implies that exogenous mortality is not as predictable
as endogenous mortality.

Plots of the fitted curves of endogenous and exogenous mortality are
shown in Figure 2. Since we are not interested in where the fitted equations intersect, but in where the actual exogenous and endogenous mortality rates
intersect, we also computed 95 per cent
confidence intervals for the two curves.

Figure 2 shows the fitted regression
lines, the 95 per cent confidence intervals, and the convergence of the lower
confidence interval of endogenous mortality with the upper interval of exoge

nous mortality. (The lower confidence
interval of exogenous mortality does not
appear in Figure 2 since it drops below
the zero point on the vertical axis.)
These confidence intervals of endogenous and exogenous mortality converge
between days 18 and 19. In this 0 to 18
day period, 93 per cent of all deaths are
due to endogenous causes; further, 82
per cent of all endogenous mortality
within the first 364 days of life occur in
this 0 to 18 day period. The data in Figure 2 appear to suggest the inapplicability of the neonatal mortality rate, as currently defined, as a proxy for an
endogenous mortality rate.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The use of neonatal and postneonatal
mortality rates as proxies for endogenous and exogenous mortality rates is
common in demographic and epidemiological research. The results reported in
this paper suggest that such a practice is
not entirely valid, and that, perhaps, a
reformulation of the operational definition of the neonatal mortality rate is in
order. We have shown that day-specific
endogenous mortality rates predominate during the first eighteen days of life
and that curves representing the patterning of day-specific endogenous and
exogenous mortality rates converge at
about the 18th day, and not at about the
28th day. Our study thus cautions
against the use of the neonatal rate, as
currently defined, as a proxy for endogenous mortality. (Practically speaking,
since mortality data by day of death are
usually reported by the National Center
for Health Statistics for only the first
week of life, and thereafter by week of
death, we may wish to revise our recommendation so that the neonatal rate in

Of all classifiable infant deaths occurring between the 29th and the 365th day
(the current numerator of the
postneonatal mortality rate), less than
half (46.5 per cent) are due to exogenous causes. Of those occurring between the 19th and the 365th day, again
less than half (44.5 per cent) are due to
exogenous causes. The results of our
study clearly suggest that the postneonatal mortality rate, whether defined as
deaths occurring during the 19th
through the 365th day, or the 29th
through the 365th day, should not be
employed as a proxy for exogenous
mortality. Endogenous mortality is
prominent through most periods of the
first year of life, whether it be the first
week, the first three or four weeks, or
the last eleven months.

A final point which needs to be addressed is the extent to which the results
of this New-Mexico-based analysis may
be generalized to other states. A recent
study by Rogers and his associates
(1983) suggests that generalizability
may not be that critical an issue. They
showed that neonatal mortality rates for
New Mexico computed for the mid
Neonatal Mortality Rate 11

1970’s do not differ statistically in any of
five ‘‘weight-specific categories from the
corresponding corrected rates for Georgia. [Also] infant mortality rates for
New Mexico do not differ statistically in
(all but one of the] weight-specific categories from the corresponding rates for
New York City” (Rogers et al., 1983, p.
105). There appears to exist a rather
close correspondence between neonatal
and infant mortality rates per se in New
Mexico, Georgia, and New York City.
Given these results, one should not expect the findings of our New-Mexico—
based analysis to be applicable solely to
New Mexico. Indeed, if the kinds of
matched birth and death data used for
New Mexico were available for other areas, thus permitting a replication of our
study elsewhere, we do not anticipate
that the results would be significantly
different from those reported here.
