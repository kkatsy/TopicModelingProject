& ABSTRACT: This study examines data from Native Ontario reserve residents (Embree, 1993) and a
sample from the Ontario Health Survey Supplement (1990-91) in order to compare and contrast
Athe importance of family attributes such as parent-child attachment to Native and Non-native patSterns of drug and alcohol use onset. Proportional Hazards modeling (Cox, 1972) was employed to
ooidentify factors associated with the risk and timing of onset of alcohol and illicit drugs for both culco tural groups. For both Natives and Non-natives alike, and considering both drinking and drug use
"_ onset together, age cohort predominates as a risk factor, with youngest groups at greatest risk, and
‘Sespecially in the case of drug use other than alcohol. For the model of drug use timing, age of alcoShol use onset is the second best predictor for Natives, although its effect is still apparent, albeit
.Wweaker, in the case of Non-natives. As for family characteristics, a number of factors emerge as de‘Oterminants of risk and depend, in part, on the cultural group and the substance under considera= tion. Consistent with attachment theory’s prediction about the universal applicability of the need
‘Sfor close parent-child relations (Bowlby, 1969), the findings for both Natives and Non-natives alike
zpoint to the salience of psychosocial attachment and other indicators of family functioning in af‘Zfecting early onset drinking and drug use, behaviors well-recognized to lead to potentially adverse
mental and physical health consequences as well as to negative social outcomes.

quality of the parent-child affective relationship (Black et al., 1986; Mian et al.,
1994) have all been linked empirically
with the risk of developing problem drinking and other behaviors such as illicit drug
use (Vaillant, 1994).

From among the various nonfamily environmental or social influences, peer risk
factors have also been cited as important
determinants of the onset and use of alcohol and other drugs (Blackson and Tarter,
1994; Dupre et al., 1995; Swaim et al.,
1989). However, it is also recognized that
family influences underlie decisions about
peer associations. Fundamental problems
such as poor family conditions tend to increase the chances of associations with others oriented towards problem behaviors
such as drug use involvement (Oetting et
al., 1989).

Reviewing research from a variety of
different cultures (Zitzow, 1990), Heath
(1998) argues for the universal importance
of close affective ties with parents in affecting a wide variety of outcomes such as academic performance, psychological wellbeing, juvenile delinquency, and substance
abuse. In general, children having viable
relationships with parents are less likely to
become involved with drugs and drugoriented peers (Coombs et al., 1991). Indeed, much cross-cultural research has produced findings consistent with the claim
that there are certain universal truths about
human nature which involve common responses to important stimuli (O’Hara,
1995; Triandis, 1993).

One such universal truth is the need for
attachment in intimate relationships according to the theory of psychosocial attachment proposed by Bowlby (1969). In
the literature on family functioning, attachment is defined as a strong affectional
bond between caregiver and child that af

fords the child a sense of security and lays
the foundation for further attachment behavior later in life (Bowlby, 1969),

Individuals lacking a sense of parental
attachment will tend to be anxious and insecure, making later peer attachments and
committed relationships more problematic
(Bowlby, 1989). In general, developmental
pathways of individuals are tied to their attachment experience with the primary caregivers (usually parents) early in life. Negative responses to a lack of secure attachment
may occur throughout life, especially in
stressful situations or periods of transition,
such as adolescence. Indeed, poor parental
attachment has been associated with a number of unfavorable life events such as problematic parenting later in life (Tayler et al.,
1995); violence and aggression (Green,
1996); personality disorders (Fonagy et al.,
1995); poor love attachment as adults (Pistole,
1995); promiscuity (Walsh, 1995); low academic achievement (Cutrona et al., 1994); perpetration of sexual abuse (Alexander, 1992);
and substance abuse (Crittenden, 1995).
Walsh (1995) finds that, consistent with the
expectations of attachment theory, the experience of reliable and supportive family relations is associated with a lower susceptibility to drug use involvement. Moreover,
among all available predictors, Walsh’s
(1995) results indicate that parental attachment has the most powerful influence on the
propensity toward drug use.

According to attachment theory’s universality claim, pathological outcomes like
early substance use onset in response to
poor parent-child relations should be observed regardless of cultural context since
the need for intimate attachment in primary
groups such as the family, as initially argued by Cooley (1962), is said to be culturally invariant. We seek to test empirically
attachment theory’s claim about cultural

 
102

universality in basic psychosocial processes
like parent-child bonding by comparing different cultural groups in Canada—Natives
and Non-natives—for the importance of
family attachment variables for the timing
of alcohol and drug use initiation. On the
basis of attachment theory expectations,
we also predict that individuals experiencing successful attachment with parents
. during childhood will be less likely to enS gage in deviant or illegal behaviors such as
+ under-age drinking and use of illicit drugs
‘=than those who failed to experience sucS cessful relations with parents.
A With the exception of the study by
&Gfellner and Hundleby (1991) on the drug
use patterns of a school population of
youth in Manitoba, no previous research
has tested explicitly the impact of family
‘gattachment variables on the risk of sub.fstance use among Canadian Natives or ex.2amined cross-cultural differences in these
relationships. In addition, although an im° pressive number of recent studies have ex‘gamined familial factors and substance use

Latham and Napier, 1992), few have utiF lized large general population or nontreatQ ment samples as we do here.

Available evidence about substance
misuse and dependency within the Ontario
Native Canadian population appears to
parallel what has already been established
about many Native American groups (e.g.,
Brown et al., 1992-93; Okwumabua and
Duryea, 1987; Grobsmith, 1989; Gutierres
et al., 1991; Hughes and Dodder, 1984;

1992; Lujan et al., 1989)}—the presence of

De Wit et al.

Social Biology

of these populations (Merskey et al., 1988;
Liban and Smart, 1982). Reports on patterns of substance use among Native adolescents in Manitoba tell us that Native
youth are more likely than their Nonnative contemporaries to use a variety of
drugs or to use them with greater intensity
(Gfellner and Hundleby, 1991).

The importance of our study is
premised on the need to analyze in more
depth the determinants of substance use
among Natives and to distinguish any identifiable features of risk from those of the
general population. Additional research on
Canadian Natives’ alcohol and drug use
patterns and how these might differ from
those of the general population would help
to inform the most successful prevention
and treatment strategies for a group which
appears to suffer heavily from a variety of
drug-related health, family, and other social problems (Embree and De Wit, 1997).

Many of the above-cited family influences are thought to involve a genetic component. Behaviors such as child abuse, for
instance, may be transmitted genetically as
a proclivity towards aggression or impulsiveness. The potential genetic impact of
parental substance abuse on offspring’s use
patterns has been examined in a number of
studies including those by Bierut et al.
(1998) and Merikangas et al. (1998). According to Merikangas et al. (1998, p. 973),
“there is increasing evidence that substance
use disorders are familial and that genetic
factors explain a substantial degree of their
familial aggregation.” The question of
racially-determined genetic differences in
susceptibility to drug or alcohol addiction
appears to be more controversial, with the
few up-to-date studies dealing specifically
with North American Indians yielding mixed
results (e.g., Barthwell, 1995; Wall et al.,
1996; Garcia-Andrade et al., 1997; Goldman
Vol. 46, No. 1-2

et al., 1998). More complete answers to
these questions depend on the availability of
clinical data and are therefore beyond the
scope of our study. Instead, we focus on the
impact of psychosocial influences thought to
arise from family membership.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

., For comparative purposes, one sample
—

S consists of a random sample of adults collected from a Native Ontario community
2 and the other, a random subsample of the
2 adult population from the 1990-91 OnA tario Mental Health Survey Supplement
2% (OHSSUP). The data on the Native population are based on a simple random sam0 ple of 876 adults ages 19 and over from a
3 Native Ontario community with a total
'¢ household population of approximately
221,200 (Embree, 1993). One adult respon3 dent was chosen at random from within
a each household. The overall response rate
° for the survey was about 72 per cent. The
‘% questionnaire contains a large number of
Y items pertaining to substance use beliefs
5 and practices, as well as a number of questions about the respondent’s family life
° while growing up. Females account for ap8 proximately 70 per cent of the sample due
S to higher non-participation rates among
= males who were more likely to be absent
A from the home for a variety of reasons.
Data for the general population were
obtained from the 1990-91 Ontario Mental Health Survey Supplement (OHSSUP),
a stratified, multi-stage area probability
sample of the household population ages
15 and older. Excluded from this group
are residents of Native reserves, prison
inmates, foreign service personnel, and
residents of remote areas. The original
sample represents 9,128 persons ages 19
and older randomly selected from the

Family Attachment Processes

 

103

household interview portion of the 1990
Ontario Health Survey (OHS). The final
response rate for the survey was 76.5 per
cent. The OHSSUP contains detailed information on patterns of alcohol and
other substance use as well as a wide
range of demographic and socioeconomic
characteristics pertaining to the respondent’s childhood home environment.

To yield more meaningful tests of significance, we applied sample weights to the
data and rescaled them to equal the actual
number of cases in the sample. Further adjustment for an overall study design effect
(DEFF = 2.2)! resulted in a sample size of
6,154. Of this number, 3,655 cases were
randomly selected for analysis. This subsample was generated in order to yield
more similar sample sizes for the two
groups under study while, at the same time,
attempting to compensate for the lower relative prevalence of certain behaviors such
as illicit drug use in the general population.
Additional descriptive characteristics of the
two samples are shown in Table 1.

As already noted, the age at which individuals begin consuming either alcohol or
drugs strongly predicts more serious negative consequences later in life, including
physical health consequences for the user
(Soderstrom, 1994; Berman and Atkinson,
1994) and for unborn children (Conry,
1990; Harris et al., 1995; Lamanna, 1982;
May, 1991), as well as a host of interrelated
social problems, such as disrupted family
relations, depression, criminal behavior,

'DEFF refers to “Design Effect” which reflects the
relative magnitude of the standard error of key measures
obtained with the given sampling design compared to
the standard error obtained with Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which is considered as a standard. Therefore, DEFF values greater than one signify that the sample variance with the given design is larger than would
be obtained were SRS sampling employed. This, in
turn, indicates lower sampling precision relative to SRS.

viduals may either survive the event up to
the survey time, in which case they are
considered censored, or succumb to the
event before the date of the survey (uncensored cases).

Available background predictors pertaining to early family functioning and attachment include: the experience of sexual
abuse during childhood; parental depression during childhood; whether the
mother or father had a drinking or drug
problem; the perceived closeness of the
affective relationship with parents while
growing up; the experience of early
parental loss through separation or death;
and the occupational attainment of the parent or guardian while the child was growing up. In particular, reported intimacy in
parent-child relations is a direct measure
of successful attachment; collectively, these
family background attributes may help to
determine the likely degree of successful

*The Native and Non-native data sets alike measure
time in discrete units (i.e., years of age) which may result
in a large percentage of ties. Since most survival models
are based on the mathematical assumption of continuous
time (i.e., time measured in small fractional units such as
days, weeks or months), a large number of ties may lead
to biased regression coefficients (Blossfeld et al., 1989).
Relevant research on the question of substance use timing, however, has revealed little difference in the shapes
of the hazard functions estimated via discrete versus continuous time methods (see De Wit et al., 1997).

psychosocial attachment between parents
and their children.

The respondent’s age and sex are also
considered since various studies have observed significant age and sex differences
in alcohol-related behaviors (Blankfield,
1990; Cheng and Chen, 1995; York and
Welte, 1994). Age at the survey data is included as a covariate in our analysis to as
wsess possible cohort differences in the risk
sof substance use onset. The analysis of
drug use timing examines the specific imact of alcohol consumption onset in addiSion to the other covariates just noted. In
Gorder not to confound cause with effect,
“the necessary assumption made here is
that the initiation of drinking, as discussed
above, operates as a “gateway” or precur<sor to subsequent use of other substances.‘
Ss For both samples, covariates selected
for the hazard analyses of alcohol and
.Alrug use onset are measured as follows:
“Age at the date of data collection is
grouped according to the age categories
‘al9-30, 31-49, and 50 or older, with the
Soldest group serving as the comparison or
reference group. Parental occupation dur“ing the respondent’s childhood is grouped
“according to “professional,” “service sector
pr small business,” “farming or other occuations,” “blue collar” (the reference catesory), and “unemployed.” In addition, the
Amodel of drug use onset examines the influence of timing of alcohol use onset. With
this variable, the relevant categories are
“never drank,” started “before age 13,” “between 13 and 16,’ “between 17 and 18,”
and “19 or older” (the reference group).

“Since peer risk variables such as tobacco and alcohol use are not available from the Native data set and
are only measured as of the survey date in the OHSSUP
data, they are not included as possible predictors of
substance use timing.

De Wit et al.

Social Biology

Among the Native sample, quality of
affective relations with mother and father
while growing up are measured separately,
with those not enjoying close relations
serving as the reference.’ In the OHSSUP
sample, relationship with parents is also a
dichotomous variable measuring perceived
closeness between parents and child while
the respondent was growing up; those not
enjoying close relations serve as the reference category. With the OHSSUP measure,
unfortunately, no distinctions can be made
between quality of the child’s relationships
with the mother and the father since the
question from this survey referred to parents collectively. This combining of mother
and father is unfortunate since, as Rutter
(1995) points out, most people will have
more than one attachment figure in their
lives and their relationship with each can be
quite different. Moreover, the original survey question (“Did you have a close relationship with your parents while growing
up?”) was measured according to two pos
*In the Native sample, the childhood attachment
measure is comprised of six items designed to tap the
degree of emotional warmth, intimacy, affection, communication, support and understanding that respondents
perceived themselves as receiving from their parents as
children. Each item consists of five ordinal-level categories ranging from ‘never’ to ‘almost always’. Parental
attachment items in the Native questionnaire, measured
separately for relations with mothers and fathers, were
as follows: Thinking back over your relationship with
your mother/mother substitute or father/father substitute, how much of the time did s/he:

. Speak to you with a warm and friendly voice?
. seem emotionally cold to you?

. Show affection toward you?

. enjoy talking things over with you?

. make you feel you weren’t wanted?

. seem to understand your problems or worries?

Each of these items is summed and the resulting
scale (Cronbach’s Alpha reliability coefficients of 0.88
and 0.89 for the mother and father series questions, respectively) is dichotomized according to positive versus
negative affective relations with each parent while
growing up (i.e., never, almost never or sometimes experiencing positive interactions versus very often or almost always enjoying such relations).

sible outcomes, necessitating the reduction
in the number of categories on the Native
survey measures. Apart from this one discrepancy, the measures employed in the
two data sets are operationalized in a very
similar or identical manner.

Mother’s and father’s substance abuse
and depression are dichotomous variables,
with those not reporting a history serving as

the reference group. Sexual abuse is meaSsured at the nominal level according to
+ whether the respondent was ever abused sex‘gually as a child. Those not experiencing
Sabuse of this nature serve as the reference
Acategory.’ Separation status refers to whether
the respondent was separated from either
“of his or her parents prior to age 16. In
“both samples, those not experiencing a
separation serve as the reference group.

In the OHSSUP survey, sexual victimization refers
to the following events during childhood:
a. whether anyone had ever exposed him/herself to
the respondent;
b. whether anyone had ever threatened to have sex
with the respondent;
c. whether anyone had ever fondled the respondent’s sex parts; and,
d. whether anyone had ever tried to have sex with
or had sexually attacked the respondent.
In the Native survey, sexual victimization refers to
the following items:
a. whether, as a child, the respondent had ever
been sexually approached by a non-family person; and,
b. whether, as a child, the respondent had ever
been sexually touched or fondled by a family member.

Sex is measured at the nominal level, with
females as the reference category.

The Proportional Hazards model (Cox,
1972) combines multiple regression with
life table techniques. This technique is appropriate in overcoming the problems of
censoring, which is common in event history analyses and due to the truncation of
observations at the survey date. For example, in the analyses of drug use onset,
only 10 per cent of respondents in the
OHSSUP sample reported substance use
by the time of the survey, whereas about
40 per cent in the Native group report
prior drug use. Life table techniques can
handle this data truncation by combining
the experience of those who have undergone the event of interest with those who
have not, in the calculation of (corrected)
survival probabilities.’ In contrast, with
more static techniques such as linear regression which are suitable for determining the structure (i.e., relevant predictors)
of an event, hazards modeling is ideal for

7Two important assumptions, however, must be made
by event-history models in overcoming the problem of
censoring. First, it is assumed that all cases eventually experience the event of interest, whether by the survey date
or at some future time. Second, censoring is assumed to
occur randomly over the interval such that censored cases
are considered to be at risk of initiating use half way
through the interval. A probability of experiencing drug or
alcohol use is then calculated for each case at various durations. The denominator of these conditional probabilities includes both censored and uncensored cases who are
at risk of substance use onset during the interval. The numerator consists of the actual number of cases experiencing onset. Since the Proportional Hazards procedure
makes full use of all censored cases, individuals who are
censored or lost to analysis by the survey date are assumed to experience the same risk of substance use as
others at the mid-interval of survival time. It should be apparent that, with the very large proportions censored in the
drug use analysis, particularly with the OHSSUP data, the
assumption that all individuals eventually experience the
event of interest may be problematic. Nevertheless, given
clear-cut evidence from the present study for increased incidence of substance use among younger cohorts relative
to older ones, this assumption may be less problematic
among younger than older age groups.

studying the process (timing) of an event
such as substance use onset.

To identify trends in drinking and drug
use onset, we first estimated proportions
experiencing the events of interest classified by the given demographic and family
background characteristics. The Proportional Hazards modeling technique (Cox,
1972) was then applied to the data in or
. der to determine the impact of family atS tachment on the rate at which both Natives and Non-natives experience drinking
"gor drug use onset. The application of this
2 procedure yields estimates of the magniAtude and direction of effects on timing of
2a given level of the independent variable
cas well as the relative risk of undergoing
cothe transition of interest associated with a
particular demographic or family charac‘gteristic. Different levels of risk, higher or
lower, imply differences in timing, either
.Yearlier or later, compared to that for an es= tablished reference group.

For k time-constant variables, Cox’s
Proportional Hazards model is as follows:

*For further information on the estimation procedure involved, see Allison (1984) and Kalbfleisch and
Prentice (1980). In unstandardized form, the coefficients mean that a unit change in the level of the covariate involves a given change (either positive or negative)
in the hazard, controlling for other variables in the
equation. Exponentiating the coefficients in order to fix
the baseline or reference category to one, coefficients
less than one work to decelerate the timing of the event
or the failure time by a given factor, while coefficients
greater than one are interpreted as having an accelerating effect on timing. These antilogged parameter estimates, therefore, yield numerical multipliers of risk per

RESULTS

Concerning descriptive characteristics
associated with alcohol and drug use onset and consumption, Non-natives’ use
patterns are as follows: median survival
times (corrected for censoring) are 17
years for alcohol use and 35 for drug use.
Only 7.5 per cent of this group have
never used alcohol by the survey date
whereas almost 91 per cent are censored
with respect to drug use. Given the especially heavy censoring of drug use for the
Non-native group, interpretations of “failure” or “survival” times, estimated on the
basis of uncensored cases, should be
treated with caution.’ Nine per cent of
this sample began drinking before the age
of 13; almost 40 per cent, between the
ages of 13 and 16; 21 per cent, between
the ages of 17 and 18. About 24 per cent
delayed drinking until at least age 19, the
current minimum legal drinking age in
Ontario.

For the Native group, comparable corrected median survival times with respect
to alcohol consumption are 17 years and
to drug use, 32 years. Only about 7.5 percent of this group have never used alcohol by the survey date whereas 60 per
cent are censored by the survey with respect to drug use. Eight per cent began

unit difference in the predictor (Singer and Willett,
1991). With dummy variables, the exponentiated coefficient gives the relative hazard for the groups corresponding to values of the dummy variable, controlling
for other predictors.

*The necessary assumption (explained in Note 7)
that all individuals eventually experience the event of
interest is certainly unrealistic in the case of behaviors
such as drug use onset, the result being that survival
times are significantly biased upward; nevertheless,
these estimates still allow us to make valid comparisons
of the relative timing of initiation for Natives and Nonnatives. From this evidence, it is apparent that Natives’
onset of drug use is earlier (by 3 years) than that of the
general population.

drinking before the age of 13; 36 per
cent, between the ages of 13 and 16; 22
per cent, between the ages of 17 and 18;
and about 26 percent delayed drinking
until at least age 19."°
The uncorrected estimates provide information on patterns of onset for initiators alone and are not, therefore, susceptible to the influence of censoring. Further
in analyses of the subset of Native and Non= Native initiators of substance use reveal
“some important similarities and differSences between the two cultural groups:

appears to be associated inversely with
substance use onset, and particularly with
illicit drug use among Natives where we
observe that nearly 75 per cent aged 19 to
30 (compared to 20 per cent of Non-natives of the same ages) have started taking drugs. Males also have substantially
higher rates of initiation of substance use,
with the male-female disparity being particularly noticeable with patterns of illicit
drug use, Substantially higher proportions
of drug users are found among both sexes
in the Native sample: Fifty-seven per cent
of Native males and 34 per cent of Native
females report drug use onset, as compared to about 13 and 7 per cents for
Non-native males and females respectively. In the model of drug use onset, the
age at which alcohol use begins appears
to be linearly related to use of drugs; the
impact of this effect seems particularly
strong among Native Indians where only
12 per cent of life-time alcohol abstainers
report initiation of illicit drug use, compared to 85 per cent of those who started
drinking before age 13.

As for family-functioning attributes,
parental substance abuse appears to be associated with onset for both Natives and
Non-natives, and especially so for illicit
substance use. Higher proportions of initiators of substance use are also associated with parental mental depression.
Concerning parental occupation, the
highest rates of illicit substance use are
found among those with professional
background status, regardless of cultural
status. Differences in proportions initiating alcohol use according to parental occupation appear to be negligible. Early
separation from parents appears to be a
salient predictor of illicit substance use
initiation for both cultural groups. Among
both Natives and Non-natives, childhood

sexual victimization also appears to be
associated with substance use initiation
and illicit substance use in particular.
Poor parent-child affective relations as
well appear to relate to onset. Among Natives, positive paternal relations seem to
correlate with lower rates of illicit substance use onset in that over 55 per cent
of those reporting poor relations with
their father while growing up have also
initiated illicit drug use, in contrast with
about 38 percent of respondents reporting
satisfactory relations. With Non-natives,
a similar pattern of results is evident with
the combined parental-relations measure.
Twelve per cent of subjects having poor
parental relations also report taking
drugs, as compared to about 9 per cent of
the group enjoying good parental relations.

Table 3 gives the relative risks of
drinking and drug use onset, respectively,
for both Natives and Non-natives. We observe that a number of factors are significant in affecting the rate at which both
Natives and Non-natives experience substance use onset. Looking first at the
OHSSUP results on drinking onset, age

cohort exerts the strongest impact on the
risk, with those in the youngest age group
being at 2.25 times (p = 0.001) the risk
of early onset compared to the reference
group; in a similar manner, those ages 31
to 49 at the survey date are at 1.39 times
(p = 0.001) the risk of those in the reference group.

Father’s drug and/or alcohol problem
achieves statistical significance at p =
0.05 and indicates a 14 per cent increase
in risk over those not experiencing this
problem while growing up. The impact of
mother’s substance use problem is more
conspicuous, with those reporting a problem being at 61 per cent (p = 0.001)
greater risk of early onset compared to
the reference group. Father’s depression
(but not mother’s) increases the risk significantly as well, by approximately 30
per cent (p = 0.05). Parental occupation
proves to be a significant predictor as
well. Service sector and small business
backgrounds reduce the risk significantly
by 19 per cent (p = 0.05) compared to
blue collar occupations. Unemployment
appears to increase the risk substantially
(by 28 per cent) but not significantly so,

possibly due to too few cases. Sex also
influences the risk, with males being 66
per cent (p = 0.001) more likely to begin
drinking. None of the other variables in
the model appear to exert a significant effect on timing of alcohol use, including
sexual abuse, although the obtained coefficient indicates the expected direction of
effect (i.e., 11 per cent greater risk for
those victimized). Overall, the model is
statistically significant at p = 0.001 (~
= 368.00, df = 14).

Turning to the results on Natives’ alcohol use onset, we observe the following. Age cohort has the largest impact on
the risk of alcohol use onset, with those
in the 19 to 30 age category 2.58 times (p
= 0.001) more likely to begin drinking
than those in the oldest age category.
Those in the middle category, ages 31 to
49, have an increased risk of almost 80
per cent (p = 0.001) compared to their
elder counterparts. The results for Natives and Non-natives alike suggest

 

strongly that the risk of initiating alcohol
use among young people is increasing in
a dramatic and linear fashion. Sex is also
an important predictor, with males at 46
per cent higher likelihood of initiating
drinking than females (p = 0.01).

From among the family characteristics,
father’s substance use problem is associated with a 39 per cent increase in risk
(p = 0.01); quality of maternal relations
corresponds with a 33 per cent reduction
in risk but does not quite achieve statistical significance at the conventional minimum probability level of p = 0.05 (p =
0.07). Parental occupation is also important to the risk, with those from a predominantly farming background at 44 per cent
lower risk than those from blue-collar
backgrounds (p = 0.001). As for the effects of childhood sexual abuse, it is apparent that victimization has a positive
impact on the risk. Those reporting abuse
are found to be at 54 per cent greater risk
of early onset alcohol use than their

 
 

114

nonabused counterparts (p = 0.01). The
overall model is statistically significant at
p = 0.001 (@? = 136.49, df = 15).
The models of drug use timing shown
in Table 3 also reveal some interesting
patterns of results. Considering first the
general population results, as with the
models of drinking onset for both cultural
groups, age cohort has by far the largest
impact on the risk of drug use onset. In
othe case of drug use, however, the effect
is much more dramatic. For instance,
those in the youngest survey-date cohort
ages 19 to 30) are found to be almost 20
Atimes (p = 0.001) more likely to begin
drug use compared to the reference group
consisting of those in the oldest group,
cnages 50 or older; those in the middle age
group (ages 31 to 49) are over six times
‘s(p = 0.001) more likely to initiate drug
€se than their older counterparts. The
-Omeasure of alcohol use onset provides evZidence that earlier use of alcohol among
SNon-natives is associated with the use of
‘;other drugs. Specifically, individuals who
Obegan drinking prior to age 13 are 88 per
Ecent more likely (p = 0.05) to use other
—substances than are those waiting until
<after age 19 (the legal drinking age) to
-Sbegin drinking.
© As for family characteristics, father’s
Sdrug and/or alcohol problem (but not
Amother’s, although the coefficient is positive as expected) is also influential.
Specifically, the risk of initiating drug use
is increased by 60 per cent (p = 0.01)
among those with a history of paternal
substance abuse. Father’s depression (but
not mother’s) during childhood also has a
similar but stronger effect on the risk, elevating it by 100 per cent (p = 0.01). The
experience of sexual abuse during childhood increases the risk by 72 per cent (p
= 0.05). From among the categories of

De Wit et al.

 

 

Social Biology

parental occupation, only the “service
sector and small business” group appears
to be at significantly different risk of drug
use (2.12 times greater) compared to the
blue collar category (p = 0.001). Possibly, this result for white-collar-type occupations is explained by the fact that use
of many kinds of illicit drugs requires
greater financial resources than may be
enjoyed by those from blue collar backgrounds (note that the coefficient for the
professional group is also positive, although the sample size may be too small
to enable detection of a significant effect). Positive parental affective relations
reduces the risk by 30 per cent (p =
0.05). Males are found to be at 70 per
cent greater risk of drug use onset than
females (p = 0.001). Overall, the model
achieves statistical significance at p =
0.001, with x2 = 297.63, df = 18.
Turning to the Native sample, as was
true for both Natives’ and Non-natives’ alcohol use, we find that age cohort has a
large and significant impact on the timing
of drug use onset. The youngest group,
ages 19 to 30 at the survey date, are 13
times more likely to begin drug use than
members of the oldest cohort, ages 50 and
older (p = 0.001). The middle age category is also at greater risk, specifically
3.28 times greater, compared to the reference group (p = 0.01). According to the
results, the risk of drug use onset for both
Natives and Non-natives is clearly increasing over time. Despite apparent risk
increases over time for the various age
groups of respondents from both cultural
groups, the possibility cannot be ruled out
that the accuracy in recalling early life
events like substance use initiation may
also vary somewhat according to age. In
addition, changes in availability over time
due to either supply or demand factors reVol. 46, No. 1-2

lated to changing socioeconomic, legal or
political circumstances could also be operative. A further possibility is that observed age cohort effects for both cultural
groups are explainable, in part, by unmeasured peer influences. Our results appear consistent with Harris’ (1995)
“group socialization theory” postulating
that children’s peer groups may be increasingly influential as socializing
= agents in urban societies. Timing of alcohol use Onset exerts a powerful systemBatic influence on the risk of drug use,
9 with the earliest group of drinkers (i.e.,
A before age 13) at 10.64 times the risk (p
2% = 0.001) of the reference group of late
ce onset drinkers (i.e., ages 19 or older);
cothose in the 13 to 16 age group at six
times the risk (p = 0.001); and those in
‘g the 17 to 18 age category at four times
Sthe risk (p = 0.001).
'2 Among available family indicators,
= mother’s depression increases the risk by

5 Farming and other occupational back& ground lowers the risk by 37 per cent and
almost achieves significance at p = 0.07.
Unemployment, as well, appears to have
the expected positive effect on the risk (55
per cent increase), but is not statistically
significant. Males are observed to be at 51
per cent greater risk than females (p =
0.05), whereas the experience of sexual
abuse during childhood elevates the risk of
drug use by 47 per cent (p = 0.05). The
model is statistically significant at p =
0.001 (x7 = 286.31, df = 19).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The above findings need to be interpreted in light of certain methodological
limitations. First, since the data are primarily retrospective, they preclude
prospective evaluations of causal relationships between childhood family experiences and onset of alcohol or other drug
use. Other literature, nevertheless, offers
strong support for the use of retrospective
reports of early childhood events, downplaying the common criticisms of bias and
distortion in recall (Brewin et al., 1993;
Lopez, 1996; Anderson and Stevens,
1993; Blatt and Homann, 1992).

A further concern is the possible influence of “uncontrolled heterogeneity.” Population heterogeneity refers to the differentiation of a population according to a variety
of biological, socioeconomic, or demographic characteristics. Unfortunately, not
all of these attributes are readily observable
or measurable for the purpose of including
all relevant variables in the model. A good
example of such effects would be peer associations which cannot be readily measured retrospectively among adult samples.
Because such variables cannot be incorporated in any satisfactory way, they are referred to as uncontrolled heterogeneity."

In addition to these general methodological concerns is the issue of comparability of results from the two data sets.
It is commonly observed that Natives
throughout North America have suffered
heavily from social problems such as
family violence and child neglect, suicide,

"Although efforts have been made to develop statistical models which attempt to control for this possible
“unobserved heterogeneity” (for example, Yamaguchi,
1986), the use of such controls is considered controversial and involves untested mathematical assumptions
about the distribution of the unmeasured effects (Vuchinich et al., 1991).

and drug and alcohol abuse (Durst, 1991;
Kirmayer, 1994; Morrissette, 1994;
Niezen, 1993). The observed smaller
prevalence estimates in the OHSSUP sample compared to the Native group for drug
use onset in particular (10 per cent versus
almost 40 per cent respectively) suggest
that comparisons about patterns of drug
use should be drawn tentatively. Despite
_,the robustness of the model, extremely
<= heavy censoring means that estimates may
be unstable since probabilities will be cal-Sculated on the basis of too few cases.
The primary goal of this study has
A been to test empirically the validity and
cultural generalizability of attachment
eetheory in predicting alcohol and illicit
cosubstance use onset among Natives and
Non-natives in Canada. We find that a
“gnumber of features of the family environcoment may entail significant protective
5 and risk effects in the timing of substance
use onset. Since the data do not allow for
San explicit test of the “nature versus nur“ature” question, we cannot rule out explaSnations involving genetic mechanisms of
© personality development and behavior.
> While the impact of the various family
attachment and functioning measures appears to depend, in part, on which type of
substance and which cultural group is unEder consideration, the results do point to
Athe salience of the early family environment in affecting the risk and timing of
drug and alcohol use onset. Oetting et al.
(1989) suggest that drug use among Native
American youth relative to Nonnative youth may be more heavily influenced by family associations due to the
more isolated living conditions on many
Native reserves which have the effect of
limiting youths’ access to friends. Although the findings do not suggest such
differences insofar as family variables ap
cembde

pear to be similarly important in both cultural contexts, the explicit incorporation of
peer-attachment measures in future models
would certainly improve our understanding
of the relative importance of family versus
nonfamily associations; such models
would also provide a more complete test of
the net impact of family contextual factors.

Our results also suggest some important patterns of differences between Native reserve residents and the larger population, namely, that initiation of drinking
is a much more important indicator of the
onset of use of other substances among
Natives than among Non-natives. The
timing of substance use progression patterns may indeed be shifting, as suggested by Golub and Johnson (1994),”
such that alcohol use is no longer a necessary precursor to the use of more serious substances. However, Native communities may lag behind the general trends
in drug use behaviors exhibited by the
larger society in a manner analogous to
the long-standing differentials in patterns
of morbidity and mortality between the
two populations. As Natives’ and Nonnatives’ patterns of health and illness converge with Natives’ achievement of the socalled “epidemiological transition” (Omran,
1971), the influence of early-onset drinking on the timing of drug use initiation

"Golub and Johnson (1994) argue that the timing of
the substance use progression pattern might be shifting.
Whereas the typical pattern in the past has been from alcohol use to marijuana use to more serious substances,
findings from a sample of serious drug abusers indicate
that alcohol use is not a prerequisite for marijuana use,
but marijuana use almost always preceded the use of serious substances such as cocaine, crack and heroin. This
same research maintains that early onset of substance
use is a major predictor of later drug usage, but that the
importance of alcohol as a precursor to marijuana use
may have declined due to the relative increase in the
prevalence of marijuana use since the 1960’s as well
as the increased acceptance of alcohol consumption in
present-day society.

may also diminish. Whether this change in
turn implies ultimately a change in the
overall risk of drug use onset for future cohorts of Native youth remains to be seen.
The evidence obtained here indicates that
prevention of early alcohol consumption is
more important in combating illicit drug
use onset for Natives than Non-natives.
This information would seem to be particcn ularly important in view of the observed
= large (absolute and relative) proportions
‘ initiating drug use in the present sample of
© Canadian Natives (almost 40 per cent of
© Natives compared to only 10 per cent of
A Non-natives). Parallel findings on Native
20 versus Non-native use patterns in other reco gions of Canada are reported by Gfellner
0 and Hundleby (1991).
=  Oetting et al. (1989) have argued that
‘g Natives’ greater susceptibility to drug use
.cois due not to specific cultural beliefs and
5 practices but to an excess of poverty,
2 prejudice, and lack of economic, educao tional, and social opportunities. The
+= commonly-held assumption in the litera© ture that Native North Americans’ distinc= tive culture contributes to substance abuse
—does not appear to be supported by our
2 data given that, apart from differences in
-2 prevalence of illicit drug use initiation, the
& mechanisms do not seem to be remarkably
€ dissimilar for the Natives and Non-natives,
4& This finding would seem especially evident
insofar as various dimensions of family attachment examined here are seen to have

Family Attachment Processes

117

comparable influences on the likelihood of
substance use onset. Findings from Gfellner and Hundleby (1991) as well support
the general conclusion that there appear to
be more similarities than differences in the
correlations between predictor variables
and substance use among Native and Nonnative youth in Canada.

The implications of our findings for attachment theory are that family relations
among both Natives and Non-natives are
important to children’s decisions about
whether and when to begin using alcohol
or drugs. Thus, intervention programs
aimed at preventing early onset use of alcohol or other drugs may be similarly
valid for both groups. The information
gathered from this study about relevant
risk and protective factors is essential to
the development of effective health programs and policies, especially in light of
strong evidence from this study that for
Natives and Non-natives alike the risk of
alcohol and particularly drug use onset
among younger cohorts has increased dramatically over time, relative to the experiences of previous generations.
