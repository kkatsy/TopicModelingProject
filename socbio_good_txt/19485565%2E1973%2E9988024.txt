Birth Weight in Various Population

Groups in Israel

Jenni Tsafrir and Isaac Halbrecht

 

Human Reproduction and Foetal Development Research Institute,
Tel Aviv University Medical School; and Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology, Hasharon Hospital, Petah Tikva, Israel

There are two distinct indices of maturity in the newborn—the clinical parameters which can be observed at birth and
the relationship of these parameters to the
amount of time spent in the uterus. The
birth weight alone does not distinguish
between these two indices, but it is considered the most suitable single index in the
investigation of maturity (Yerushalmy et
al., 1965). Thus, the grouping together of
all babies “premature” by weight (2,500
gm. or less) does not distinguish between
infants who normally have a lower birth
weight, as in certain ethnic groups, and
those whose low weight is due to unfavorable intrauterine conditions, or possibly
genetic causes (Gruenwald, 1963).

The attempt to separate genetic or racial
factors from environmental factors as etiological agents contributing to birth weight
continues to hold the attention of research
workers in many fields, the ultimate aim
being the improvement of intrauterine development and minimization of intrauterine
and neonatal hazards.

In Israel, whose population is composed
of people of many different origins whose
social environment has changed, sometimes
drastically, during their own lifetime, the
conditions are ideal for the comparative

71

study of the various indices of reproductive
function. The present study on birth weight
is an attempt to single out some of these
variables in the framework of different population groups, for it is believed that in one
or two generations, the relative “isolation”
of ethnic groups will gradually disappear as
intercommunity marriages increase (Tsafrir
and Halbrecht, in press), and the study of
ethnic differences will no longer be meaningful, if indeed possible.

MATERIALS AND’ METHODS
COLLECTION OF DATA

The data were collected at Hasharon
Hospital, Petah Tikva, by interviewing in
the maternity wards the mothers of all
single newborn babies who weighed 2,000
grams or more and were discharged from
hospital alive after the customary three to
four days.

Supplementary information was obtained
from the hospital records and, where available, from the “progress of pregnancy”
card issued by the Mother and Child Care
clinics attended by most pregnant women
in Israel.

The information was then coded and
transferred mechanically to IBM punch

72 Tsafrir and Halbrecht

cards and sorted mechanically with the use
of an IBM sorter.

GROUPING BY COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN
The mothers were grouped according to
their country of birth. The total sample
does not claim to represent the percentage
distribution of the different groups in the
general population of Israel. The mothers
were divided primarily according to the
grouping “Ashkenazis” and “non-Ashkenazis,” corresponding roughly to Jewish
populations originating from Eastern Europe, Germany, etc., on the one hand, and
from Middle Eastern countries, North
Africa, etc., on the other, and then subdivided according to country of origin (see
Table 1).

Social Biology

The third major group distinguished
in the present study consisted of Israeli
Arabs. The total sample of 1,735 babies was
made up of 637 Ashkenazis, 988 non-Ashkenazis and 110 Arabs. Because of language
difficulties or incomplete documentation, the
information recorded on the third group
was often insufficient, thus not allowing a
comparison between all three groups for
each variable studied.

It will be seen immediately that there
is much greater variation within the nonAshkenazi group (lowest MBW 3,000.5
gm.; highest MBW 3,460.0 gm.), than

among the Ashkenazis (3,251.7 gm. to
3,446.9 gm., excluding one subgroup with
only 3 individuals). In the first large group
(Group I), no single subgroup varied significantly from the group mean of 3,361.6
gm. In Group II, three subgroups showed
significant differences from the group mean
of 3,326.4 gm.: Morocco-Algeria (4 =
3,460.0 gm., p < 0.002), and Eygpt-LibyaTunisia (x = 3,444.0 gm. p < 0.01),

estimated from the reported date of the
mother’s last menstrual period. In the Arab
group, this date was most often not known,
and only the two other groups have been
compared here. In these groups too, information on the gestational age was missing
in some of each group. However, the MBW
for each group when the “unknowns” are
omitted does not vary significantly from the
mean for the whole group, and it is assumed
that the exclusion of these “unknowns”
affects the two groups to the same extent.

babies of higher birth weight (> 4,000

groups (3,000-3,999 gm.) as compared
with both Ashkenazis and Arabs. This difference is statistically significant (?. =

GESTATIONAL AGE

Tables 3 and 4 show the percentage distribution of births by gestational age, as

Group II there were more babies born in
the earlier weeks (35.1% less than 40
weeks) than in Group I (24.3% less than
40 weeks). This difference in relative distribution is statistically significant (p =
0.001).

There was no significant sex difference
in the distribution by gestational age, either
in Group I or Group IT (Table 5). The
expected differences in MBW _ between
males and females were confirmed.

OTHER PARAMETERS

Factors such as the interval since the
last birth, previous history of abortions,
and maternal anemia were also investigated
with regard to their possible effects on birth
weight.

It appeared that babies born less than a
year since the last delivery were slightly
lighter than the rest, including firstborns.
Moreover, it was found that in Group I
the overwhelming majority (almost 75%)
of the births took place more than two
years since the last delivery, while in
Group II a higher proportion of births
took place within 1-2 years of the previous
delivery (33.3% as against 22.9% in
Group I; see Table 10).

Mothers who had had one previous spontaneous abortion (“miscarriage”), in both
Group I and Group II, had Aeavier babies
than those who had never had any abortions or those who had had two or more.
This difference was significant for both
groups (p = 0.02, = < 0.001, respectively). Conversely, mothers who had undergone one previous induced interruption
of pregnancy had lighter babies than the
other three groups. The difference here was
not significant (Table 11).

Insufficient data were available on the |
maternal hemoglobin values during pregnancy or after delivery to permit investigation of this variable adequately.

ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN BIRTH WEIGHT

In the literature on the characteristics
of various population groups in Israel, there
are many different ways of grouping the
people from different origins. The grouping
according to countries of birth does not
always give a true indication of ethnic
affinities, which have been obscured by
numerous migrations of the Jewish people
over the past few centuries. However, it
provides a convenient working method and
a fair approximation of origins.

It was seen in the present study that
there was much greater variation in MBWs
between the different subgroups of Group
II than within Group I; the highest as well
as the lowest MBWs were found in the
former group. Because of this variation,

tioned. However, the grouping for the purpose of providing adequate samples for
analysis was considered justified on the
basis of geographic, ethnic, and cultural
affinities.

A possible bias introduced into this study
was the exclusion of babies weighing less
than 2,000 gm. Hytten and Leitch (1964)
found that the exclusion of infants of less
than 2,500 gm. weight in one study raised
the MBW by roughly 100 gm. They assumed that the exclusion of postmature
infants of high birth weight would lower
the mean. The means obtained in the present study are thus presumed to be slightly
above the true means for all births for the
population groups concerned, and probably
not to the same extent for each ethnic

78 Tsafrir and Halbrecht

group. However, Hytten and Leitch concluded on this point that the exclusion of
low birth weight infants, stillbirths, etc.,
make “surprisingly little difference to the
means . . . even for hospital statistics.”

It is extremely difficult to study women
from different ethnic groups strictly comparable in respect of social circumstances
and general health status. Nevertheless,
many consistent differences in mean birth
weights have been found with regard to
people of different ethnic origins (Hytten
and Leitch, 1964).

One striking example of this is the consistently lower-than-average weight of Indian babies as compared with a number of
other populations, measured in different
countries and under widely varying social
conditions (Hytten and Leitch, 1964;
World Health Organization, 1965; Madhavan and Taskar, 1969; Beischer et al.,
1970). Saigal and Srivastava (1969) went
as far as to suggest that a birth weight of
2,000 gm. was a better delimitation point
for “low birth weight” in Indian populations. It is recognized, moreover, that this
consistently small size cannot be attributed
to a shorter gestation period than in the
populations with which the Indians were
compared.

One possible explanation for consistent
differences between different populations lies
in the recognized relationship of the birth
weight to maternal size (Record, McKeown,
and Edwards, 1969). In comparing standards established in Sweden (Sterky, 1970),
Aberdeen (Thomson, Billiewicz, and Hytten, 1968) and Britain as a whole, Tanner (1970) noted the strong effect which
maternal size (height and midpregnancy
weight) had on fetal size and suggested that
differences in the latter might be explained
on the basis of differences in maternal size
between the populations.

The findings of the present study, although admittedly based on a small sample

 

Social Biology

of Indians, confirmed the above well-documented observations, the MBW of the Indian babies (3,000.5 gm.) being lower than
that of any other single group and differing
highly significantly from other groups. It
is pertinent in this context to mention another study conducted in Israel on a similar
population; Cohen and Bloch (1963) found
the MBW for babies born in 61 Jewish
families from Cochin (Indo-China) to be
3,023 gm. for boys and 2,840 gm. for girls.

Regarding weights at the other end of
the scale, it is appropriate to quote some
fairly recent studies conducted in Israel.
Epstein (1968) compared samples of babies
born in West Jerusalem, whose parents were
both born in Morocco or in Israel, respectively. He found that the MBW of children
of either sex was higher for the “Moroccan”
babies than for the “Israeli.”

Legg and her colleagues (1970) analyzed
all live and stillborn singleton infants born
to residents of West Jerusalem, whose pregnancies had lasted 28 weeks or longer, over
a three and a half year period. They found
the lowest crude rate of low birth weight
among North African immigrant mothers,
as compared with Israeli-born mothers and
those who immigrated from Asia and “Western countries,” and with non-Jews (mostly
Arabs). This confirmed a previous report
by Rosenbluth (1968) on approximately
8,000 births in a population of similar composition.

Although it is recognized that the findings of the present study are not strictly
comparable with those of other studies because of the exclusion of babies weighing
less than 2,000 gm. and of stillbirths, it is
interesting to note that our results substantiated those of the previous studies carried
out in Israel. The two groups with the
highest mean birth weights among the nonAshkenazi Jews were those from MoroccoAlgeria and Egypt-Tunisia-Libya. Two
fairly large groups among the Ashkenazi
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

Vol. 20, No. 1

group (those from Rumania and GermanyAustria) had MBWs close to those of the
North African groups, but as they did not
differ significantly from the whole Ashkenazi group of which they formed a part,
it is felt that this similarity is not significant.

GESTATIONAL AGE

For many different reasons, the effect of
gestational age alone on birth weight is
not a very meaningful concept as an index
of maturity. However, it remains a useful
parameter for dating the pregnancy, as it
is the only fixed reference point usually
available.

It is generally accepted that the most
frequent birth interval in human populations is 280 days, or 40 weeks from the
first day of the last menstrual period. This
figure is not regarded as “normal” or optimal duration, but is simply a convenient
concept for making comparisons, for example of birth weight, and of other indices of
maturity.

From data collected on 5,792 births in
Aberdeen over the period 1959-60, it was
found that 82.5% of all single births (all
birth orders) were born at 280 + 14 days
(38-42 weeks) (Hytten and Leitch, 1964).
In the present study, the corresponding
figure for Group I was 83.7% and for
Group IT, 78.9% (Tables 3 and 4). That
is, there were relatively fewer babies in
Group II born at about 40 weeks, and more
born in the earlier weeks (35.1% as against
24.3% in the weeks up to and including
38). Moreover, the MBW of babies born
at 37 weeks or before was higher in Group
II than in Group I (Group I, 2,850.4 gm.;
Group II, 3,020.0 gm.). These results seem
to indicate that a shorter gestational period
is required to reach a particular weight in
Group II as compared with Group I. In
most cases, the groups with shortened gestational length also had lower MBWs, with

the exception of the Indian babies, whose
relatively lower birth weight could not be
related to shortened gestation. In the present study, the higher frequency of shortened
gestations was associated with a higher
relative MBW.

MATERNAL BLOOD GROUPS AND MATERNAL-~
FETAL INCOMPATIBILITY

Ounsted and Ounsted (1966) showed
that in mice, placental weight is higher —
where an antigenic dissimilarity exists between the mother and fetus, and they
supposed that the rate of growth of the
human fetus might be similarly affected by
its presence in an antigenically dissimilar
uterus. According to Reed (1967), the fact
that size of the infant and length of gestation are “strongly related to fetal viability” suggests that any strong effect of blood
groups on size is also “a probable indication of selection.” From a study of about
10,000 infants and their mothers, he concluded that there were no strong effects
of mother-fetus incompatibility in several
blood groups on weight, crown-heel length,
head circumference, or period of gestation.

In the present study, maternal blood
groups did not seem to bear any significant
relationship to birth weight, with the possible exception that Rh negative mothers
had heavier babies than Rh positive mothers. In the limited number of cases available
for comparison in which the blood groups
of both the mother and the newborn were
known, there did not appear to be any
significant correlation between birth weight
and antigenic dissimilarity.

SMOKING HABITS OF MOTHER

The literature abounds with articles on
the effects of the mother’s smoking habits
on birth weight, crown-heel length, Apgar
score, fetal and neonatal mortality and
morbidity (e.g., Gillespie, 1964; Underwood et al., 1965, 1967; Terris and Gold,
1969a, 19696). It seems that there is no
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

80

apparent difference in the period of gestation in the babies of smoking and nonsmoking mothers (Frazier et al., 1961; Gillespie,
1964), so that the lowered birth weight is
due rather to a retardation of fetal growth.
It is not within the scope of this paper
to discuss the reasons for this effect, but
it is sufficient to mention that the findings
of the present study were in accordance
with previous findings on the birth weight
of babies born to smokers and to nonsmokers, namely, the former category were significantly lighter. There was no difference
between those born to nonsmokers and
those born to women who generally smoked
but ceased doing so during pregnancy. This
was true for both Group I and Group II.

OTHER PARAMETERS

With regard to the other factors investigated in the present study, the following
points may be mentioned. It seems plausible to suppose that the maternal contribution to the intrauterine environment of
the fetus might be adversely affected by
closely successive pregnancies. Donnelly
and coworkers (1957) found no appreciable
effect of the birth interval on perinatal
mortality. As mentioned above, in the present study it was found that babies born
within twelve months of the previous delivery were lighter even than firstborns, but
unfortunately the data were insufficient to
provide a meaningful conclusion. Should
such an effect be substantiated by further
study, it might be explained a priori by
supposing that the mother’s constitution
had not had sufficient time to recover, from
the hormonal and physiological point of
view, to enable her to sustain another pregnancy as successfully, immediately after
conclusion of the previous one.

Another factor believed to have a possible influence on the mother’s reproductive
capacity and thus affect her future progeny
is the occurrence of one or more abortions

Tsafrir and Halbrecht

Social Biology

in her previous pregnancy history. This
effect would naturally be obscured by maternal age and parity, or rather gravidity.

With regard to spontaneous abortions,
where one might assume some genetic or
physiological insufficiency or incompatibility in the mother-fetus relationship and
would expect to find lower birth weights,
the MBW was actually higher for those
babies whose mothers had had one previous
abortion than either for those who had
never had a “miscarriage” in the past, or
for those who had had two or more. This
difference was significant in both Group I
and Group II. With regard to induced
abortions, on the other hand, the MBW
was lower in the very same group (i.e., the
one with one abortion in the past) as compared with the others. This difference was
significant for Group I, but not for Group
II, The proportion of women who had had
one previous induced abortion was higher
for Ashkenazis (10.9%) than for the nonAshkenazis (7.3%). No regular trend could
be observed in the MBWs of babies whose
mothers had had two or more previous
abortions (spontaneous or induced) as compared with those who had never had previous abortions.

It should be noted that in the present
study no distinction was made between primiparae and mothers who were of higher
parity but who had never had a previous
interrupted pregnancy. Inclusion of primiparae in the group with “no abortions” might
tend to lower the MBW for this group.
While taking into account this possibility
and the fact that the findings were not
consistently significant, it might still be
possible to conclude, within the limitations
of the present study, that a history of induced abortion might adversely affect future progeny, but spontaneous abortions
do not. No explanation for this can be suggested on the information available here.
It would be interesting to consider sepaDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

rately cases where the “previous abortion”
immediately preceded the present birth,
with no intervening pregnancies.

SUMMARY

of 1,735 Jewish and Arab newborns, according to their mother’s country of birth,
revealed some significant differences between groups of different ethnic origins.
The possible relationships between birth
