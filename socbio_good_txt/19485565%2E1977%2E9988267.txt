The issue raised by Inhaber (Social Biology, 1975, Vol. 22, No. 3)is of great interest
to the international community, and it is
very desirable that whatever is published
and used to shape policies be valid and
properly interpreted.

The use of statistical analysis will not
remove the built-in bias of a scientist if
he/she uses a faulty experimental design.
The conclusion drawn by Inhaber is, in
this context, a contortionist’s masterpiece
of twisting and warping. As it would be

impossible—short of writing a lengthy
article-—to comment on all the distortions,
I shall restrict myself to the following important points.

Using the WIPIS, as Inhaber did, as the
source of population from which to draw
his sample for analysis is erroneous. The
addresses of Indian authors given by the
WIPIS may denote the place in a developed country where the research was conducted and where the author was a
student or a postdoctoral fellow. There is
no certainty about the immigration status
of the author, as to whether he/she held a
permanent resident visa or a temporary
student or exchange visitor visa. Hence, to
draw conclusions about a “brain drain”
from the kind of data used by Inhaber has
no scientific validity.

The author reports a_ correlation
coefficient of 0.64, significant at the 1 per
cent level, between scientists in India in
1967 and 1972. What does this mean in
terms of a brain drain? Nothing, really. If,
for example, the number of scientists in
1967 and 1972 remained unchanged,
Inhaber would have obtained a perfect
correlation of 1.00. Similarly, a perfect
correlation would be obtained with certain
two sets of figures whether the emigration
increased or decreased.

Further, Inhaber’s statement (p. 251),
“They (the Indian names he chose) made
up 37.3 per cent of all scientists in India in
1967 and 32.8 per cent in 1972” implies

that he had names and number of scientists in India. Did he indeed obtain this
information from the registry of scientists
maintained by the Council of Scientific
and Industrial Research of Government of
India? In fact, that is the best source to do
research on a “brain drain,” but I doubt if
CSIR were contacted by Inhaber. I again
reiterate that use of WIPIS is completely
wrong for the research Inhaber reported.
Inhaber’s paper gives only this valid
information: In 1967, out of 1,570 papers
with 43 chosen Indian names as authors,
1,046 were published with addresses in
India. In 1972, the figures of such papers
were 3,289 and 2,032 respectively. The
addresses of Indian-named authors
outside of India did not necessarily mean
that they had emigrated. These figures can
be presented in many ways depending on
the choice and bias of the analyst.
Anyone personally familiar with the
situation in India knows that, considering
the size of population of the country, emigration of physicians is a “brain drain”
affecting India’s health delivery system. In
other areas of science, especially engineering and agriculture, there is a surplus of
scientists. One has to be living in India to
see thousands of masters-degree holders in
engineering and agriculture working as
subprofessionals. Within recent years, two
foreign-trained Ph.D.’s in agricultural science committed suicide because their
training was not being fully utilized.
