~~ ABSTRACT: Black adolescents in the United States consistently report an earlier age of first

intercourse than White adolescents. Purely psychosocial explanations of this finding have been
E SS less than successful. We propose an “epidemic” model that combines social contagion (a
2 paychneaclal process) and pubertal maturation (a biological process). This epidemic model

50 Permits social contacts among adolescents of the same age and also among younger and older
& adolescents. The model statistically fit the actual growth curve of sexuality well for Whites; its
‘@ fit was not as good for Blacks. From computer simulation analyses, we concluded that pubertal
2 maturation may be more important in accounting for the racial difference in the onset of sexual

ber 2015

‘~intercourse than previously thought.

Race differences in rates of sexual
‘Sbehavior have been reported in most
S American studies of African American
‘Sand Caucasian adolescents. Black adolescents usually report an earlier on“set of sexual behavior than White ad‘Z olescents. Understanding the origin of
- this racial difference is important for
Spublic policies aimed at reducing the
‘g negative consequences of precocious
‘sexuality, including the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (especially
° 3 AIDS) and the attenuation of life-time
opportunities because of child care
responsibilities (Hayes, 1987).

Many psychological variables that
explain variation in sexual intercourse
onset within racial groups become
much weaker, however, as explanations of racial differences. For example, earlier onset of sexual intercourse
usually occurs in lower social classes.
Nevertheless, in two independent studies of representative data sets, statisti
chigan] a

hi

cal controls for indices of social class
(education, income) failed to reduce
race differences in the onset of intercourse (Furstenberg et al., 1987; Weinberg and Williams, 1988). Moreover,
Furstenberg et al. (1987), using the National Survey of Children, explored
other variables prominent in theories
of adolescent sexuality. They calculated the log-odds of sexual intercourse
as 3.7:1 in favor of Black adolescents,
and then recalculated them after introducing various control variables. Variables measuring parents’ work status,
father’s presence or absence, school
performance, educational aspirations,
and role expectations for parenthood
all failed to reduce the log-odds favoring Black adolescents. The sole variable resulting in a log-odds reduction
(from 3.7 to 1.8) was the respondents’
report of friends’ sexual intercourse.
This peer measure, however, is but a
restatement of the situation that we

2 Rowe and Rodgers

seek to explain: the greater prevalence
of intercourse among Black peers than
White peers.

As ordinary psychological and social variables may fail as explanatory
mechanisms, we believe that some
other influence must contribute to this
racial difference. For instance, Washington (1982) suggested that this missing explanatory influence was a persistence of African heritage and a “sex
positive” culture among Blacks. The
existence of different social norms,
however, may beg the question as to
why such cultural norms persist.

Instead, we propose differences in
the timing of pubertal maturation in
Black and White adolescent females as
an explanation of their racial difference (Harlan et al., 1980; National
Heart, Lung, Blood Institute, Growth
and Health Study Research Group,
1992). Pubertal maturation has the desirable property that helps explain variation in sexual behavior within both
Black and White populations (Bingham et al., 1990; Buck and Stavraky,
1967; Cutler et al., 1979; Flannery et
al., 1991; Udry, 1979, 1988; Zabin et
al., 1986).

The work of Udry and his colleagues
indicates that pubertal development
has a direct effect on sexual interest
and behavior, independent of social reactions to changes in physical appearance (Udry et al., 1985; Udry et al.,
1986). Nonetheless, pubertal timing
has not been a major contender in
previous explanations of racial differences. Furstenberg et al (1987, p. 512)
criticized it on the grounds that nearly
all girls reached pubertal maturity by
age 15 and on the grounds that some
Black males reported pre-pubertal sex
 

Social Biology

ual intercourse. The Panel on Adolescent Pregnancy and Child Rearing
noted the tendency of Black girls to be
more mature than white girls, but they
decided that the differences in physical
maturity were too small to explain the
race difference (Hayes, 1987, p. 97).

We believe that the possible impact
of female maturation timing has not
been appreciated because researchers
have thought in terms of linear effects
only. Linear regression models consider the maturation status of the individual, but not that of the group in
which he or she is embedded. We
propose an “epidemic” modeling approach that views sexuality in the context of a social contagion process. In
our ‘“‘epidemic”’ models, individual risk
is highly influenced by group characteristics. In particular, our models are designed to fit prevalence data across
time, in which the prevalences reflect
the number or percentage of members
of some group who have ever performed a certain behavior. When such
behaviors are at least partially under
social influence, then we expect social contacts within the network to
“‘spread”’ the behavior.

These models are in a sense simulations of the interaction process that
helps such behaviors to spread. There
are two basic types of contacts simulated by our models that can lead to
spreading the behavior of interest: epidemic and nonepidemic contacts. Epidemic contacts occur when someone
who has already performed the behavior comes in contact with someone who
has not; with some probability, the
“carrier” will influence the “‘susceptible” to perform the behavior. Nonepidemic contacts occur when two “‘sus
 

 
 

Vol. 41, No. 1-2

ceptibles”’ come in contact with one another; with some different probability,
they may perform the behavior
together spontaneously. Thus, to call
these “epidemic models” only reflects
their epidemiological origin. In fact,
they model both epidemic and nonepidemic spread of relevant behaviors
with equal facility.
We refer to this general class of
‘2 models as “epidemic models of the on&i set of social activities” (EMOSA mod8 els, Rowe, Gulley, and Rodgers, 1992;
E Rowe et al., 1992; Rowe and Rodgers,
3 1991a, 1991b; Rowe, Rodgers, and
_ Meseck-Bushey, 1989). The mathe;, matical structures that underlie the
>. EMOSA modeling approach itself are
— anything but new. The application of
=the modeling approach to adolescent
= transition behaviors is the “innova‘< tion.” Such models have been used
S for a long time by epidemiologists
‘“s interested in the spread of biological
Porganisms—viruses, for example—
% through a social community, by sociol.2 ogists interested in the diffusion of in~ novations (Hamblin et al., 1973), and
= by biologists interested in modeling
y cultural transmission in addition to geSg netic transmission (Cavalli-Sforza and
< Feldman, 1981). Many social behav= iors are under the control of social
A contagion processes, and they can
be readily modeled with appropriate
mathematical formulations. In a sense,
many adolescent transition behaviors
(e.g., smoking, sexual behavior, or
even playing in the band) are rediscovered by each cohort, as new social “‘innovations”’ to be spread through the
adolescent social network.
We use some terms taken directly
from epidemiological models (e.g.,

Adolescent Sexual Behavior 3

“contagion,” “carriers,” “susceptibles’) that are helpful because they
give an intuitive understanding of the
models. We note that our models are
mute with respect to issues of morality;
nor do we imply that any type of biological epidemic is involved in the
social contagion process.

The EMOSA sexuality models
(which have only been defined for voluntary heterosexual behavior) specify
a two-state mixing population of males
and females in which cross-sex individuals meet randomly and in which nonvirgins are the potential “carriers” of
sexual intercourse. The rate of spread
of sexual intercourse depends strongly
on the number of nonvirgins in the
population at any time. The model also
accounts for noncontagious spread as
well, which occurs when two virgins
become nonvirgins together. A critical
feature of the model is the ability to
introduce filters, that are like “‘covariates” in ordinary regression models.
The filters can be used to specify certain restrictions on the mixing population. For example, an important filter
will be introduced in which only pubertally mature females are eligible to become nonvirgins.

In a randomly mixing population,
with proportions Pm of male nonvirgins and Pf of female nonvirgins, the
probabilities of two opposite-sex individuals randomly encountering one
another are Pm(1—Pf), Pf(1—Pm),
and (7—Pm) (1—Pf), for an encounter
between nonvirgin males and virgin
females, nonvirgin females and virgin males, and virgin males and virgin
females, respectively. Because our
model assumes that only pubertally
mature females will initiate sexual

activity, we restrict the mixing female
proportion to mature females of a

6¢ 99

given age proportion (M,, where “‘a”’ is

-an age in years). Two recursive equa
tions with the rate parameters T,,,,,

Tf, and k define our model:

(1) Pm,y, = Pm, + TgP. a(1—Pm,)
+ kM,(1—Pm,) (1—Pf,);

and

(2) Phas = Pf, + TamMPm,(1- Pf)
+ kM,(1-—Pm,) (1-Pf,);

where “a” is the age period (i.e., 10
years, 11 years, etc.); Pm is the proportion of male nonvirgins; Pf is the
proportion of female nonvirgins; M, is
the proportion of pubertally mature
females at the age “a”;! T,, is a rate
parameter for nonvirgin females contacting virgin males; T,,,, 1s a rate parameter for nonvirgin males contacting
virgin females; and k is a rate parameter for virgins. Female pubertal maturity was operationally defined as attaining at least Tanner’s Stage 4 for
both breast and pubic hair development (see Rowe et al., 1989). Nearly
all girls at these stages are postmenarchial.

The rate of parameters T,,,,, and T,,,
may be interpreted as the average number of effective contacts made by nonvirgin males with virgin females and
nonvirgin females with virgin males,
respectively, per year. An effective
contact is one that leads to sexual intercourse, if the person contacted is a
virgin. The parameter “‘k”’ may be sim

and 2, is strictly the proportion of mature females
who are virgins, a conditional probability. Data do
not exist to estimate this proportion, however, so

computed from the proportion of mature females at
each age.

ilarly interpreted as the average number of effective contacts made by virgin males with virgin females (or vice
versa). The parameters T,,,, and T,,,
represent .averages over the population of male and female nonvirgins, respectively; some individuals may have
no effective contacts, some one, some
two, etc., in a given year. The parameter values summarize the effects of social and psychological influences on the
contagion of sexual intercourse. When
the parameter values are large, sexual
intercourse 1s being ‘“‘transmitted”’
more rapidly than when they are small.

Two important assumptions of this
model are (1) random mixing, and
(2) within-age contagion. The random
mixing assumption asserts that an adolescent is equally likely to encounter
any other adolescent. In reality, adolescents belong to friendship cliques
and tend to be similar to their friends in
various characteristics (Kandel, 1978),
including virginity status for females
(Rodgers et al., 1984). Nevertheless,
the model apparently does not fail
based on this assumption, and for modeling purposes an assumption of random assortment may be a useful approximation. Dodd (1955) reasoned
that even if units in a population are
structured, if they change frequently
and are numerous then the spread of a
behavior may approximate that under
random assortment. Friendship cliques
often consist of a number of members,
and about one quarter of them dissolve
completely in a single academic year
(Cohen, 1977). Thus, the assumption
of a high degree of ‘“‘mixing”’ in adolescent populations is reasonable.

We conducted a simulation analysis
to evaluate the importance of the random mixing assumption (Rowe et al.,

 
 

 

Vol. 41, No. 1-2

1989). In these analyses, we assumed
that social contacts were correlated so
that nonvirgins were more likely to encounter one another than they would
have by chance encounters. Over a
wide range of correlations, changes in
parameter values were small. Hence,
we concluded that the model was relatively robust to departures from the
random assortment assumption.
Another assumption of our earlier
“ model was that an adolescent’s first
6 sexual partner was exactly his or her
= own age. In fact, we know that both
® males and females tend to have as their
0 first partner an individual older than
c, themselves (Zelnik and Shah, 1983). In
>. analysis of the ADSEX data set, we
~ = found that few first partners were
= younger than the respondent (7.5 per
scent). Most were either the same age,
= one year older, or two years older (73
S per cent). Our original model as pre‘S sented in Equation 1 and 2 has been
modified to take such inter-cohort contacts into account.
This paper reports an inter-cohort
~ contagion model that accounts for
inter-cohort contacts of both epidemic
and nonepidemic types. We used the
z empirical data to decide on a three"s year window of mixing populations.
g Each adolescent is eligible to contact
© others of the same age, one year older,
or two years older. The mathematical
statement of the earlier EMOSA sexuality model from Rowe et al. (1989)
has been re-written to account for
these additional types of contacts.
Table 1 presents the mathematical
terms defining the number of added

a given year. Note that we have
changed the model from a prevalence
model (as defined in our first EMOSA

td

sexuality model) to a yearly gain
model. This change facilitates statistical tests of the fit of the model, to be
described shortly. In Table 1, there are
a total of six terms per sex divided between those terms representing the
contact of virgins with same-age or
older nonvirgins and those representing virgin-virgin contacts.

The between-cohort contacts were
weighted according to the empirical
likelihood of their occurrence. The
best empirical information on this likelihood that we could find was contained in the ADSEX data (the data
referred to previously reflecting adolescent interactions in an approximately intact social environment; see
Rowe et al., 1989, for a more complete
description of the ADSEX data). Of
the 73 per cent of the ADSEX respondents whose first partner was 0-2 years
older, 44.5 per cent were within-cohort
contacts, 31 per cent were contacts
with the next older cohort, and 24.5
per cent were contacts with the cohort
two years older. Contacts with younger
partners and with partners more than
two years older were not represented
within the model. The inter-cohort
contagion model is more realistic than
our earlier model (which only accounted for within-cohort contacts);
but obviously it becomes mathematically untractable if more than a very
few cross-age contacts are permitted
within the model.

In our earlier EMOSA sexuality
model, which was fit first to the ADSEX prevalences, we found that the
model fit better when Whites and
Blacks were treated as separately interacting populations. Further, when the
model was fit separately to the two
races, the social contact parameters

could be compared to one another as
suggestive of dynamics that underlie
the race differences.

In Rowe et al. (1989), we noted a
surprising finding: that the contact parameters were close in value between
Whites and Blacks. This finding appeared inconsistent with the prevalences themselves, in which a larger
proportion of Blacks of each sex were
non-virgins than Whites at each age.
However, the model also accounts for
differential rates of female pubertal
maturity, and Black females mature
earlier than Whites. Thus, once differential rates of maturity were accounted

actions—race differences virtually disappeared in the rate of social contagion
process.

This result—suggested by our earlier analysis—will be investigated in
this paper in more detail, with different
data, and in the context of a more realistic model. We will fit the intercohort contagion model separately to
prevalences from the two races and will
compare the parameter values obtained from those two settings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In this section we fit the inter-cohort
contagion model to a national dataset.
We also present the result of a small

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

Vol. 41, No. 1-2

“traditional analysis” in which race differences in virginity status are observed in the context of linear models
and in relation to several simple psychosocial ‘variables.

Our earlier EMOSA . sexuality
model (Rowe et al., 1989) was fit to local data from an approximately intact
social network of adolescents. All students in several Junior High Schools
from two metropolitan areas in the
southeastern United States were administered sexuality questionnaires.
Of course, no such social network will
be truly intact. Many out-of-school
—or even  out-of-town—friendship
links will exist. While it is doubtful that
any truly isolated adolescent community could ever be found, using school
surveys is a method to approximate a
relatively intact local adolescent community. At the other extreme, it is also
possible to view the United States as a
very large mixing network of adolescents.

This second approach more properly accounts for the ease of travel and
cross-city and cross-state nature of
many friendship networks, but it is certainly an oversimplification and cannot
be considered a “correct model” either. Results from nationally representative data must be viewed as providing
a description of the average process at
work across the country. Results from
the two approaches together converge
to suggest that mixing processes are
not insensitive to the level at which we
assume mixing occurs. Likewise, differences between the two types of results can suggest the ways the model
processes depend strongly on the level
at which mixing is assumed to occur.

The data that will be used to test
for psychosocial effects and fit the

Adolescent Sexual Behavior 7

inter-cohort contagion model come
from the National Longitudinal Survey
of Youth. The NLSY began as a national probability sample of households in 1979. All youth between ages
14-21 in the selected households were
eligible to be interviewed in 1979, and
then followed longitudinally each year.
The original NLSY sample size was
N = 11,405.

In 1984 and 1985, respondents were
asked to report their age at first intercourse. By 1984, respondents were
19-26 years old. 4,934 of 5,043 (91 per
cent) of the males and 4,771 of 5,281
(90 per cent) of the females contacted
reported an age at first intercourse either in 1984 or 1985.

The NLSY over-sampled Black
youth in 1979. A total of 7,410 Whites
and 3,174 Blacks responded to the
1984 follow-up. Because households
were randomly selected in 1979, these
respondents may be considered representative of these age cohorts in 1979
(except for nonresponse and attrition).
Because our analyses will be run within
race, sampling weights (which primarily adjust for different sampling rates
by race) were not used.

MEASURES

Sexual Intercourse Prevalences. —
Retrospective reports of age of first intercourse were coded from respondent
reports. These reports were converted
into prevalences of nonvirginity at each
age from 10 to 18 years of age. Several
past research efforts have been devoted to reliability and validity issues
in both concurrent and retrospective
reports of sexuality (e.g., Rodgers,
Billy, and Udry, 1983). An extensive
effort showing relations between the
NLSY data we will use and results from
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

other national surveys is presented in
Kahn et al. (1988).

Self-esteem. —The NLSY files contain responses to the 10-item Rosenberg self-esteem scale (Rosenberg,
1965), which has been used widely in
both substantive and methodological
research. Each item had a 1-4 response scale, coded in the direction of
positive self-esteem, yielding a scale
range from 10 (lowest self-esteem) to
40 (highest self-esteem).

Parental Education.—The _ best
measure of social class that was available in the NLSY was the indication of
parental education. This measure was
constructed as the average of nonmissing parental reports of highest grade
completed.

Religiosity.—Religiosity was  assessed using self-reported frequency of
church attendance. The scale ranged
from 1-6 (1=not at all; 2 = infrequently; 3 = once/month; 4 = 2-3
times/month; 5 = once/week; 6=
more than once/week).

Maturational Level.—The NLSY
simply did not include good measures
of pubertal or physical maturation, a
crucial variable for our study. This limitation would have been a major liability, except that the fitting procedure
only requires prevalence data on maturation (at the same ages to which we
are fitting sexuality prevalence data).
Since the NLSY estimates national
rates, other sources based on probability samples that also reflect national
patterns were considered at least adequate substitutes for this limitation in
the NLSY data. The best available
source for defining maturational prevalences was the U.S. Health Examination Survey (HES: Harlan et al., 1980),
from which female maturity rates were

at least Tanner’s Stage 4 on both pubic
hair and breast physical development.
Table 2 presents the maturity values,
M,, for U.S. Black and White females
estimated from the HES.

One remaining limitation of these
maturity values was addressed. The
NLSY data could be used to construct
reliable estimates of intercourse prevalence down to age 10, whereas the
maturity prevalences were only available in HES down to age 12. We considered several different approaches to
handle this problem, including limiting
analyses to those aged 12 and greater.
Because of sample-size limitations
(i.e., so that we could use the sexuality
prevalence data for ages 10 and 11),
however, we extrapolated the maturity
values in Table 2 to predicted values
for ages 10 and 11, and we use these
values in the results we report. We
used a simple linear extrapolation procedure (since a linear model fits aggregate physical maturation well, although
individual physical maturation is nota

bly nonlinear). These extrapolations
are also included in Table 2. In our earlier study fitting the ADSEX data
(Rowe et al., 1989), maturity prevalences were available for White females directly from this local sample.
Those data support the extrapolated
values in Table 2. Proportions mature

was set equal to the proportion observed in the data. In fourteen iterations, the model-generated proportions reached an equilibrium state (for
given values of T,,,,,,, T,,, and k) and did
not change appreciably with the addition of new cohorts.

Trial values of T,,,, T,,, and k were
improved by maximizing a log likelihood function (Z) based on the proportion making transition between any
two ages (Hoel et al., 1971). That is,

Adolescent Sexual Behavior

(3) L = N(p0441—P0q)
log (pegs 1 Pea)

where N was the sample size, po was
the observed cumulative proportion at
age “a+1” and “a,” and pe was the
model predicted cumulative proportions at age ““a+1” and age “‘a.”” Summation was over the total number of
ages. The tail, 1 — proportion at the
oldest age, was also included in evaluating the likelihood.

Because likelihood ratio tests of statistical significance are very sensitive to
sample size, they generally indicate
lack of fit of a model in any large dataset. We use two different fit statistics to
respond to weaknesses in the likelihood ratio tests. First, the “‘rate r2”’ is
a goodness-of-fit measure that is less
dependent on sample size (Pitcher and
Hamblin, 1982). This statistic is computed as the correlation between the
proportion predicted to become nonvirgin between each pair of ages and
the proportion observed to do so
(N = number of ages — 1). Because it
is acorrelation-based measure, the size
of the rate-r? is also easily interpreted.
A second statistic we will use is a
goodness-of-fit index that is becoming increasingly popular: the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC: e.g.,
Sclove, 1987; Bozdogan, 1987). The

RESULTS

We present two types of analyses in
this section, a preliminary “‘traditional
analysis,’’ and a much more complete
EMOSA. analysis. The preliminary
analysis attempts to explain the race
difference in adolescent sexual behavior with linear models and traditional
psychosocial variables. The EMOSA
analysis uses the inter-cohort contagion model to simulate the social interaction of adolescents, along with a
maturational filter for females that provides a biological constraint on the
mixing process.

TRADITIONAL ANALYSIS

The first line of Table 3 presents the
correlation of race with age of first intercourse (AFI). Then several partial
correlations are presented in which one
psychosocial variable was partialed out
of the race-AFI relationship. If the
race-AFI correlation is partially caused
by the relationship of each to the psychosocial variables, we would expect
the partial correlations to be substantially less than the original.

Race had a greater impact on sexual intercourse initiation in males (r =

0.36) than in females (r = 0.14), given the dummy coding (White = 1,
Black = 0). These associations showed
an earlier onset in Blacks than Whites.
All correlations were statistically significant, although the samples sizes are
so large that they were not necessarily
meaningful substantively.

None of the psychosocial control
variables appreciably reduced the racial effect in males (partial rs 0.340.38, compared to the original of 0.36).
In females, controlling for parental education reduced the partial correlation
from 0.14 to 0.11. The religiosity variable actually worked in the wrong direction and increased the racial difference.

In summary, in both sexes, most of
the racial difference remains unaccounted for after adjusting for the covariates. If we drew conclusions from
this type of modeling, we would report
that the race difference is largely unexplained, and that the particular psychosocial variables we investigated—
variables selected because they would
appear on theoretical grounds to be
strong contenders to explain the race
difference—are not potent explanatory variables. Of course, a much more
careful and in-depth linear model analysis of these relationships could be
run, further replicating and extending

work described in the literature review
above. However, we instead apply the
EMOSA approach, which is substantively interpretable as simulating a
plausible social process, and which simultaneously accounts for both psychosocial and biological processes.

again, that when maturation differences between Black and White females are accounted for, most racial

The parameter values obtained by

0.041 versus 0.037). The equivalent
parameter estimates from Rowe et
al. (1989), using a different dataset and
a simpler model, were T,,- = 0.90 for
Whites and T,,;= 0.78 for Blacks,
Tm = 0.22 for Whites and T,,,, = 0.31
for Blacks, and k = 0.10 for Whites
and 0.14 for Blacks. Thus, not only are
the parameter estimates stable across
the races within each study, but the
pattern of contact parameters are consistent across two different datasets
with two different versions of the
EMOSA sexuality model.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

In any model-fitting exercise like the
one we report here, there may be
pieces of the mathematical structure of
the model that are particularly ‘“‘volatile.” For example, if the model is
highly dependent on the quality of the
maturation estimates at ages 10 and 11,
then substituting extrapolated values
instead of using actual data for these
estimates would be problematic. If, on
the other hand, the model results are
quite stable across a whole range of
possible values for these estimates, we
would have much less concern over using the extrapolated values.

We will present two types of sensitivity analyses. The first is an inspection of the sensitivity of the model to
exactly the example above, that is,
changing values in the age 10 and 11
maturation estimates. The second is a
comparison of the importance of the
contact rate parameters (the psychosocial part of the model) with the maturation filters (the biological part of the
model).

The use of linear extrapolation may
have overestimated the racial differ

ence In maturation timing at ages 10
and 11 years. At age ten, the problem
was especially acute, because the linear
extrapolation predicted fewer than
zero per cent mature for Whites, and
we reset the value to 1 per cent. We
tried new values of 20 per cent Black
females and 5 per cent White females,
and new values of 15 per cent Black
females and 10 per cent White females.
— The statistical fits changed only slight“ ly with the new maturation estimates;
fits for Blacks improved, and fits for
Whites showed no trend. The races’
parameter values were closest when
the original Black’s 24.9 per cent and
White’s 1 per cent maturation values
were used. In percentage terms, the
largest change occurred in the virgin
contact rate, ‘‘k,’’ where the Black rate
increased and the White rate decreased
(in the 20%/5% run, k = 0.044 Blacks
and 0.034 Whites; in the 15%/10%
run, k=0.048 Blacks and 0.032
= Whites). Those results are even closer
to being consistent with those obtained
using the earlier ADSEX data.

MATURATION COMPARED WITH
CONTACT RATES

These results suggest that a physical
process—maturation timing—may be
more important for explaining race differences than the rate parameters in
the social contagion process. An explicit comparison of the effects of maturation timing and contagion rates can
be made by using the model to make
predictions. In the actual data, considerable racial difference already exists
at age 10 years: for example, 6.5 times
more Black than White 10-year-old
males reported nonvirginity (7.2 per
cent vs. 1.1 per cent). To avoid this

unexplained heterogeneity, we ran the
model starting with zero per cent nonvirgin 10-year-old males and females.

Four types of models were run: (1)
White contact parameters, White maturation values, (2) White contact parameters, Black maturation values, (3)
Black contact parameters, White maturation values, and (4) Black contact
parameters, Black maturation values.
Models with the same maturation rates
(e.g., 1 and 3) were compared to models with the same contact parameters
(e.g., 1 and 2). If maturation timing
has the greater effect, rate r?’s for
models with the same maturation timing (but different contact parameters) should be greater than rate r?’s
for models with the same contact
parameters (but different maturation
timing).

Table 6 presents comparisons of
‘same contact parameter” models versus “same maturation” models using
different assumptions about pubertal
maturity at age 10 years. Different contact parameter values (but the same
maturation timing) had the least impact on model predictions. Indeed, in 5
out of 6 comparisons, the solutions under White versus Black contact parameter values were essentially identical
(rate r? > =0.98). Changing the maturation assumptions had the greater
impact on the solutions. The rate r*’s
explained from 4 per cent to 8 per cent
less variance when maturation was
changed than when the contact parameters were changed, and the rate r2 between solutions ranged from 0.91 to
0.93. These results indicate that observed racial differences could arise
more easily from different maturation
timetables than from differences in
effective contact rates.

To illustrate the strong potential for
purely maturational differences to influence the timing of sexual intercourse, Table 7 compares a model run
using equal contact parameter values
(T,,¢ = 0.641, T,,,, = 9.371, and k=
0.039) and using either White or Black
maturational data. This model further
assumed that 10-year-old children of
either race were virgins. The effect of
the maturational difference was to produce ratios of nonvirgins favoring
Blacks from 4.6 to 1 to 1.2 to 1. Even
holding all assumed social process
equal across Whites and Blacks, we
find that pubertal maturation timing
can potentially produce large racial differences in adolescent nonvirginity.

DISCUSSION

The prevalence of nonvirginity increases rapidly in early adolescence,
but more rapidly for African American
than Caucasian adolescents. Many psychosocial variables postulated to explain the onset of sexuality within
Black or White groups fail to account
for this mean racial difference. Using
a nationally representative sample, we
found that three psychosocial variables (self-esteem, religiosity, and social

class) could not explain this racial
difference. Thus, we chose to focus
on maturational differences between
Black and White adolescents with
Black girls maturing earlier than White
girls. It was hypothesized that maturation could account for a large part of
the racial difference if it was included
as a parameter in a statistical ‘‘intercohort contagion”? model of the prevalence of sexual intercourse.

Fitting this inter-cohort contagion
model to nonvirginity prevalences supported the hypothesis. The contact parameters, T,,,, and T,,, reflected the
rate of “‘spread”’ of sexual intercourse
from nonvirgins to virgins; and k reflected the rate among virgins. If social
norms and cultural factors mainly accounted for the race difference, we
would expect that these parameters
would be larger in Blacks than in
Whites; they were not. On the other
hand, the maturational timing differences had a greater impact on nonvirginity distributions than did reasonable
differences in these parameter esti
‘mates. Data were generated from one

set of parameter values using different
Black and White maturational timing
data. This comparison showed that racial differences in maturational timing

alone can produce large racial differences in rates of nonvirginity.
Further, the basic structure of the
contact parameters was very similar to
that obtained in Rowe et al’s (1989)
analysis of the ADSEX data. The effective contact rate of females was relatively high, suggesting the relative
ease with which female nonvirgins can
convert male virgins. The male effective contact rate was lower, and nonepidemic contact rates were fairly small.
Our inter-cohort contagion model
certainly cannot account for all aspects
of the data. Overall fit for Whites was
somewhat better than for Blacks and
over-predicted the number of nonvirgin Black females. For males, race ratios in the observed data were larger

ated data in Table 7. The failure of the
model to fit Black Americans as well as
White Americans may reside more in
the data than in the model. Black
Americans’ reports of sexuality and
deviant behavior tend to be less reliable than White Americans’ (Hindelang et al., 1981; Mensch and Kandel,
1988; Rodgers, Billy, and Udry, 1982).
Falsely claiming intercourse among
males or falsely claiming nonintercourse among females could produce
the patterns of deviations from the
model seen here.

Further efforts to develop social
contagion models of the onset of intercourse should progress on two fronts.
First, reliable data are needed on sexuality from representative samples of
adolescents, including data on physical
development and hormones. Second,
further steps must be taken to bring the
social contagion model closer to reality. Through either equation or computer simulation approaches, we need
to include explicitly in our models
some of the psychosocial variables affecting adolescent sexuality (such as
parental education; see Billy et al.,
1988).

There are many other possible applications of our EMOSA social contagion models. In other research, the
EMOSA models have been applied
to smoking and drinking (Rowe, Chassin, Presson, Edwards, and Sherman,
1992; Rowe and Rodgers, 1991a). The
smoking model introduced a sequence
of stages absent in the sexual behavior model; namely, transitions were
defined among four statuses—nonsmoker, experimental smoker, regular
smoker, and ex-smoker. The first transition, from nonsmoker to experimental smoker, involved a social contagion

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

16

process, whereas the remaining transitions did not. The sexual behavior
model could be extended in the same
direction by adding a transition from
infrequently sexually active—as is the
case for most young adolescents—to
frequently sexually active. For females, transitions could be added representing pregnancy and childbirth.
Our models also may describe how
AIDS spreads heterosexually into
younger populations depending on the
degree of cross-cohort mixing as modelled here. Thus, further work could
extend our EMOSA models to the
spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. Social contagion processes also may apply to behaviors such as marriages, which are
not ordinarily thought of in this way.
More broadly, social contagion
models fit into work on cultural evolution and coevolution (Boyd and Richerson, 1985; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 1981). Although we applied our
model here to a specific behavior—
sexual intercourse—social contagion
processes also may be used to explain
the spread of cultural knowledge
among adolescents. In our application,
we would want to model the increase in
the adolescent population of accurate
knowledge about sexuality and of social beliefs regarding sexuality. In
Dawkin’s (1992) terms, the prevalence
of ‘“memes,”’ the unit of replication of
cultural transmission, must be understood. An advantage to studying cultural transmission among adolescents
is that generation times would be relatively short. Ignorant 9-year-olds become knowledgeable 16-year-olds in
just seven years. In contrast, new cultural innovations and other “memes”

Rowe and Rodgers

Social Biology

may take generations to reach an equilibrium in human populations, or reach
their equilibrium just once, making
them inaccessible to empirical research. Thus, by focusing on adolescence, models of cultural transmission
can be given a practical empirical test
in a way impossible for many other
cultural “memes.” Such testing would
help to select among the many competing ideas about cultural transmission,
ideas which have received elegant
mathematical formulations but little
empirical testing in the theories of cultural transmission.

We have not addressed here the possible social policy implications of our
modeling approach. Many psychosocial accounts of racial differences in
sexuality rely on “weaknesses” in the
Black community—for example, on
“single parent families” and “poverty.”’ Our explanation for the race difference casts the Black community in a
more value-free light; after all, the
mother of a mature 11-year-old, regardless of race, is more concerned
about her daughter’s sexuality than the
mother of an immature 11-year-old
daughter. Thus, this biological explanation is in a sense “race free,” relying
as it does on a maturational mechanism
that just happens to covary with race.
This approach also could have implications for the design of social interventions, if they paid attention to the
dynamics of sexual intercourse in the
early teenage years as a means of delaying the onset of the “‘social contagion” of sexuality. We do not address
social policy implications here, however, because our goal was only to define a causal description of the spread
of adolescent sexual behavior.

In conclusion, we do not claim that
maturational timing differences are the
only cause of race differences in adolescent sexuality. Such a view would be
taking a model too literally. However,
we believe that the importance of
pubertal maturation has been substantially underestimated. Psychosocial explanations may have been overestimated, but this possibility is difficult to
assess when a variable as apparently
important as maturation has been excluded from previous analyses. In fact,
psychosocial variables may have much
less variance to account for (and may
potentially do so more successfully)

once models that include a maturational component and a plausible dynamic description have been further
developed. ‘‘Epidemic’”’ modeling of
the onset of adolescent behavior provides one such modeling paradigm.
