Some Characteristics of the Migration of

Blacks in the United States

Joseph S. Himes

Department of Sociology and Anthropology

It is well known that for a long time
black people have been leaving the rural
South. It is equally well known that these
people have been going to cities, not only
outside the South, but within the South
as well (Farley, 1968). The black population is still redistributing itself within the
United States. Yet it has become evident
that this migration is more inclusive and
complex than mere exodus from the rural
South,

At the same time, it has come to be
widely believed that migration of blacks is
a cause, or at least a major correlate, of
important social problems. This nexus between migration of blacks and social
problems is embodied in a series of myths
that now constitute part of the popular
racial heritage. For example, it is widely
believed that the black communities of
big cities grow relentlessly by in-migration
of young, low-status blacks from the
South’s farming areas. This pressure of
black in-migration is popularly seen as
the prime or at least a leading cause of
racial polarization and violence (Lubell,
1970).

The following discussion will examine
briefly (and perforce superficially) some

 

 

trends of the migration of blacks within
the United States in recent years. The
analysis is based on recent census data
and will be organized around the following
issues: (1) growth, (2) inter-regional
migration, (3) urbanization, and (4) selectivity. The focus of analysis is on trends,
although some attention is of necessity
given to the current pattern. In the course
of this analysis some data and findings will
be presented that tend to challenge widespread beliefs about the migration of
blacks.

The findings presented below are subject
to several limitations. First, no data from
the 1970 census relating to migration of
blacks are yet available. Data for all years
after 1960, therefore, are based on sample
studies or estimates and may therefore
involve varying degrees of inaccuracy
when generalized. Second, for the same reason, data for years after 1960 are limited
in both amount and detail. It has therefore been impossible to examine or to
verify migration trends in relation to some
specifics or details. This limitation is especially pronounced in the case of the selectivity trends.

GROWTH

In Table 1, we present data on the size
of the black population from 1900 to 1969.
Although this population almost trebled
in the seventy years under consideration,
increasing from 8.8 to 22.3 millions, it
remained about the same proportion of
the total American population, slightly
more than one-tenth. Virtually all of this
growth resulted from natural increase,
i.e., excess of births over deaths.

In the forty years after 1900 the black
population grew by almost one-half, 46.6%.
This was an annual rate of increase of
slightly over 1.1%. However, as Table 1
indicates, the rate of growth increased
markedly in the two decades between 1940
and 1960. In the 1940-50 decade, the
average annual rate of growth was about
1.6% while between 1950 and 1960 it was
2.5%. In the decade of the 1960’s both
the amount and rate of increase of the
black population declined. Decline of the
rate of increase was impressive, from 2.5
to just under 1.9%.

The black population has not only increased throughout the twentieth century;
it has also moved around within the territory of the United States. Some of the
patterns of this movement, e.g., countryto-city, south-to-north, and east-to-west,

are familiar. However, underneath these
broad patterns of migration we find a large
volume of short-range shifting and shuttling about. Migration not only redistributes the population within the national
territory; it also tends to alter the composition of the population in any given
place over time.

INTER-REGIONAL MIGRATION

The black population grew at different
rates in the various regions of the country.
Part of this growth resulted from migration. These regional differences in growth
are shown in two ways in Table 2. It is
seen that during the thirty years, 1940
to 1969, blacks as a per cent of the total
population of the South declined from 24%
to 19%. At the same time, the proportion
of blacks residing in the South declined
from three-fourths, 77%, to over one-half,
52%. To put the matter another way,
while the national black population was
increasing at an average annual rate of
2.5% between 1950 and 1960, in the South
the rate was 1.1%; and between 1940
and 1950 the respective rates were 1.6%
and 0.33% (Hamilton, 1970, Table 6,
p. 19). .

The loss of black population in the
South is reflected in steady growth of this

population sector in the other regions.
Thus Table 2 shows that between 1940
and 1969 although the percentages remained relatively small, the proportions
of blacks in the populations of the other
regions doubled or better. At the same
time, the proportion of blacks living in
these regions increased markedly, doubling
in the Northeast and North Central regions and growing from 1 to 7% in the
West.

Although the numbers involved were
relatively small, as revealed by both measures, growth of the black population in
the West was explosive in the three decades
under consideration. It seems likely that
this trend can be expected to continue in
the foreseeable future. It will be shown in
a later place that the growth of population
in all regions did not result exclusively
from migration.

Some data are available to show the
amount and direction of interregional
migration. These data are shown in Table
3. This table shows that between 1969
and 1970, the South lost 197,000 migrants
to other regions and at the same time
received 97,000 in-migrants. Thus, this
region experienced a net loss of 100,000
blacks.

A net out-migration of 100,000 represents a reversal of the long-time trend.
Thus, between 1940 and 1950 the region
experienced an average annual net outmigration of blacks and other races of
159,700 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969).
Between 1950 and 1960 the average was
145,700, and between 1960 and 1969 it
had declined to 88,300.

Table 3 also shows that, with the exception of the North Central and the
West, the regions produced most of their

own black population, 63.3% in the Northeast, and 80.3% in the South. The North
Central region produced only 40.5% and
the West 45.5% of their black population
between 1969 and 1970.

Table 3 also shows where in-migrants
to the various regions originated. Most
black in-migrants to the Northeast, North
Central region, and West came from the
South, thus again confirming the long-time
migration pattern. Most in-migrants to
the South, however, came from the Northeast.

URBANIZATION

The major target for black migrants in
the United States is the city. As a consequence, for a long time the rural sector has
been declining and the urban proportion
has been growing. The consequence of this
trend is shown in the figures in Table 4. It
will be seen that of the thirty largest cities,
taken in 1967, the black proportion had
increased steadily, sometimes even dramatically, throughout the seventeen-year
period after 1950. In only four cities—
Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio, and San
Diego—the proportion of blacks either
declined, remained constant, or grew only
very slightly. On the other hand, the
percentage of blacks doubled or almost
doubled in fifteen cities. In the remaining
eleven cities the proportion of blacks in
the general population showed a steady
and significant increase throughout the
period under consideration.

It has often been assumed that the urban black population grows principally
by migration from rural and other nonurban places. Recent data, however, fail
to support this belief. A 1969 census report (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969)

1 The evidence suggests that the rate of urban
growth has been declining since 1960. In this
connection, see Valien, 1970.

comments on this fact in the following
way.

Most of the estimated 2.6 million increase
since 1960 in the Negro population in central cities is due to the natural increase of
the population—that is, the excess of births
over deaths. About one-third of the net gain
—approximately 800,000 persons——is due to
net in-migration. The decline in the white
population of central cities, on the other
hand, implies a substantial net out-migration
of the white population during this period.

This picture of the relationship between
in-migration and natural increase in the

growth of the black metropolitan population is shown in Table 5. It is seen that at

both computation periods, natural increase
was the main source of new central-city
black population. In the 1960-64 halfdecade, 55.9% of new central-city blacks
were born in the metropolitan area, while
in the second, five-year period, 1964-69,
77.1% were central-city natives. Thus the
proportion of central-city in-migrants declined from 44.1 to 22.9%.

The picture of the migrant and natural-increase mix outside the central city was even
more dramatic. In the 1960-64 half-decade
this part of the metropolitan area experienced a net loss of blacks by migration.
Thus all of the growth resulted from natural increase. In the next computation

period, 1964-69, three-fifths, 60% of the
increase of blacks outside central cities
resulted from natural increase. In other
words, only 40% of the growth of this
sector of the metropolitan black population resulted from migration.

One consequence of this relationship
between migration and natural increase
in the metropolitan black population was
alteration of the age structure. Big-city
blacks tended to become not only more
“native”; they also tended to become
younger. This trend is shown in the figures
of Table 6. A cursory glance at this table
shows that in the central cities of all
metropolitan areas and at each date over

half the black residents were under 25
years of age. Persons under 16 years of
age increased from 20 to 28% of the total
black population of central cities between
1960 and 1969. On the other hand, black
individuals between 25 and 64 years of
age, the main work force, increased from
only 15 to 19% of total central city
population.

The growth of the youthful sector of
the black population was even more phenomenal in metropolitan areas of one million and more. This sector grew from 23%
in 1960 to 35% of the total in 1969. This
fact not only reflects natural increase of
the black population, but also reflects loss
of the reproductive and youthful white
population in the central cities of these
metropolitan areas. At the same time, in
these cities in 1969 the proportion of
blacks in the total population under 16
years (35%), was more than three times
as large as that among those 65 years old
and over (11%).

The concentration of the black population within younger age brackets is also
revealed in the smaller metropolitan areas,
although this concentration is not sharp.
It is noteworthy that the proportion of
older persons, those over 65 years, tended
to remain relatively small, ranging from
8 to 11% for all dates and in areas of all
size. One result of this age structure is
that the burden of support upon the
persons in the work force tended to be
large and increasing.

SELECTIVITY

It is evident that migrants tend to be
selected in some way; for example, young
children and older persons are less likely to
move than adolescents and young adults.
The selective characteristics of the black
migrants evidently have important consequences for both the place of origin and
for the receiving community. Although

 

Social Biology

the dimensions of variable selectivity of
black migration seem to be well known,
specific data to support such judgments
are not always available.

The principal general image of black
migration is related to the socioeconomic
character of the migrants. In reference to
this assumption, Karl and Alma Taeuber
(1969, p. 126) asserted: “Contradictory
expectations confronted us prior to our
analysis of the characteristics of Negro
migrants.” On the one hand, it is widely
believed that whites abandon large cities
to low-status black rural and semi-rural
in-migrants who increase the burden upon
schools, welfare services, the police, and
other public agencies. On the other hand,
the Taeubers point out that demographic
research has generally shown that higherstatus sectors of the population are the
most residentially mobile. The available
evidence tends to support these preconceptions only in part.

Referring to their analysis of the data,
the Taeubers (1969, p. 134) declare: ‘As
compared to non-migrants the black inmigrants are younger, better educated,
and more likely to be employed in whitecollar occupations; and the ratio of males
to females is similar.” As the foregoing
census data have indicated, two subgroups
of migrants can be distinguished; those
moving from one urban area to another,
and those of nonurban origin. These subgroups of migrants vary significantly in
characteristics.

The data show that in-migrants to
metropolitan areas from nonmetropolitan
places tend to be lower in educational and
occupational status than migrants between
metropolitan areas, but rather similar to
metropolitan nonmigrants. Nevertheless,
Daniel Price (1970, p. 47) has observed
that black migrants from the rural South
tend to be selected from the better educated members of the population. Thus he

Vol. 18, No. 4

writes: “Following 1950, a high rate of
out-migration of college-educated blacks
from Southern areas is seen. However,
even though the outmigrant blacks from
Southern rural areas are in general better
educated than the nonmigrants living in
these areas, their level of education is not
sufficiently high to increase the educational
level of blacks in urban areas.” For example, Irene Taeuber (1968) showed that
although 24% of the resident black population of Boston in 1960 had less than an
eighth-grade education, 29% of the nonmetropolitan in-migrants between 1955
and 1960 had this amount of education.
On the other hand, the evidence indicates
that migrants between metropolitan areas
tend to reflect higher educational achievements than both migrants from nonmetropolitan sources and metropolitan
nonmigrants. That is, although migrants
from both nonmetropolitan and metropolitan sources tend to be better educated
than nonmigrants in these two places of
origin, by comparison with black residents
in the cities of destination, nonmetropolitan
migrants are less well educated and metropolitan migrants are better educated than
the people they join in the big cities.

In respect to the age factor, the Taeubers (1969, p. 136) write, “in-migrants of
nonmetropolitan origin are generally much
younger than non-migrants or in-migrants
from the SMSA’s.” At the same time,
out-migrants from metropolitan areas tend
to be both young and predominantly male.
Daniel Price (1970, p. 54) found age selectivity of black out-migrants from the
rural South to urban places was associated
with both the resultant structure of the
black population and with the economic
status of the group. The Taeubers (1969)
found that youthfulness and high education of metropolitan in-migrants were
correlated. Thus, they state that “since
young people have generally higher average

Migration of Blacks

 

 

365

levels of educational attainment, it is possible that the younger age of the inmigrants is responsible for their higher
educational level relative to non-migrants.”

The studies of black migration tend to
reveal that sex ratios of migrants resemble sex ratios of the receiving populations.
While in-migrants to metropolitan areas
often include many females, out-migrants
from such areas are most often predominantly male. Such sex patterns of migration function to maintain the sex ratios of
the receiving communities while altering
those in the locations of origin, especially
the rural South.

Finally, it has been found that migrants
are more likely than nonmigrants to be
engaged in white-collar occupations. This
finding is supported by two facts. On the
one hand, nonmigrants tend to be either
rural Southern residents or urban centralcity persons. Both these categories of
blacks are typically not white-collar
workers. On the other hand, it has been
shown that black out-migrants, from both
honmetropolitan and metropolitan areas,
are among the better-educated persons in
those localities. They are therefore more
likely than metropolitan residents to be
able to qualify for white-collar occupations.

The Taeubers (1969) venture several
inferences regarding the effects of the
volume and character of black migration
upon metropolitan areas. First, they observe that although the total volume of
movement may be great, net migration is
relatively small in reference to total migration and to the resident populations of
the receiving areas. As a consequence, the
impact of migration, whether favorable or
unfavorable, is likely to be limited. Second,
in the case of nonmetropolitan migrants,
selectivity seems to have a deleterious effect on both the originating and the receiving communities. However, persons
leaving one metropolitan area and moving
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

366

to another are likely to have a beneficent
effect upon the educational and occupational situation of the receiving locality.
Third, the concentration of migrants in
the younger age brackets tends to augment
the working-age sector of receiving populations while at the same time augmenting
the dependent nonmigrant sector, especially in the rural South.

SUMMARY

Our data showed that although the
black population has continued to increase
throughout the present century, the rate
of growth varied, peaking in the 1950-60
decade at about 2.5% per annum and
declining thereafter. Growth of the black
population was revealed in all regions, although at variable rates. All regions gained
black population by in-migration. Only
the South experienced a net loss of black
population from out-migration to other
regions. All regions gained black population from the South.

Social Biology

The proportion of blacks residing in
cities of all sizes, and especially in metropolitan areas, continued to grow, though
at varying and declining rates. As a consequence, by 1967 blacks constituted over
half the population of one city and almost
half in several others. The proportion of
blacks in the center cities of metropolitan
areas increased more from natural increase
than from in-migration, and the rate of
in-migration was on the decline. The youngest sectors of the central-city black populations of the largest metropolitan areas
tended to grow fastest, mainly, it seems
reasonable to conclude, from natural increase.

As compared to both nonmetropolitan
and metropolitan nonmigrants, black inmigrants were found to be younger, better
educated, and more likely to be employed
in white-collar occupations. However, the
ratio of males to females tended to be
similar in both the migrant and nonmigrant
populations.
