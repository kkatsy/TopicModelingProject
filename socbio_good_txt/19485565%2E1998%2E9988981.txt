ABSTRACT: David P. Phillips has reported evidence that famous people are often able to postpone their deaths until after a birthday. A reexamination of Phillips’ data shows some aspects of
his analysis to be questionable, including the lumping together of deaths that occur during the
birthmonth, which does not distinguish deaths that occurred before the birthday from those that
occurred afterward. A reanalysis of his data shows that there were actually a relatively large
number of deaths in the month preceding and the months following the birthday. One explanation is that the anxiety associated with this milestone and the excesses associated with its celebration are sometimes fatal. Another explanation is that Phillips’ results were a fluke created by

a selective use of data.

In the early 1970’s, the American Statistical Association sponsored Statistics: A
Guide to the Unknown, a collection of essays illustrating the widespread application
of statistical tools. One essay (Phillips,
1972) began with this provocative question:

In the movies and in certain kinds of ro
mantic literature, we sometimes come

across a deathbed scene in which a dying
person holds onto life until some special
event has occurred. For example, a mother
might stave off death until her long-absent

son returns from the wars. Do such feats of
will occur in real life as well as in fiction?

The author, David P. Phillips, looked
at selected data and concluded that famous people were often able to postpone
their deaths until after a birthday, in that
there were fewer than expected deaths (a
“deathdip”) in the months preceding the
birthmonth and more than expected
deaths in the birthmonth and succeeding
months. Because the collection of essays

302

in which his paper appeared is so wellknown, Phillips’ essay attracted considerable attention, and one of the authors uses
it as an example in his statistics textbook
(Smith, 1991).

Four of this author’s students have written term papers attempting to replicate
Phillips’ findings with completely different
data sets. None found a statistically significant deathdip: 400 randomly selected persons in the Biography Almanac (Rollins,
1990), p = 0.58; 372 deceased persons in
the 1972 issue of Who Was Who in the
USSR (Hlahla, 1990), p = 0.056; 630
obituaries from the Los Angeles Times
(Collins, 1989), p = 0.59; and 264 obituaries from four newspapers (Hamburg,
1990), p = 0.30. In the study with the lowest p value, there were more deaths shortly
before the birthmonth than after, which
contradicts Phillips’ conclusion.

Puzzled by the fact that four independent attempts to confirm Phillips’ theory
failed, we decided to reexamine Phillips’

original data. One perplexing aspect of his
analysis, given his opening description of
the dramatic deathbed scene, is that he
lumped together all deaths that occur during the birthmonth, not distinguishing
those that occurred before the birthday
from those that occurred afterward. Instead, he separated the deaths into these
twelve monthly categories: birthmonth,
one month before birthmonth, one month
after birthmonth, and so on.

Phillips interprets those deaths that occurred during the birthmonth as evidence
that these people were able to postpone
death until the celebration of their birthdays. In fact, when we reexamined his
most statistically persuasive data, the deceased in Four Hundred Notable Americans (Morris, 1965), we found that of the
26 people who died during their birthmonths, 13 died before their birthdays, 1
died on his birthday, and 12 died after
their birthdays! These 26 people who
died close to their birthdays were not at
all successful in postponing death.

Given the alleged importance of the
birthday event, a more natural set of
twelve categories is one month preceding
the birthday, one month following the
birthday, and so on. And this is what we
used. We counted the 30 days preceding
the birthday as one month preceding the
birthday, 31 to 60 days preceding the
birthday as two months preceding the
birthday, and so on. The birthday itself
and the subsequent 29 days were counted
as one month following the birthday. The
next 30 days were two months after the
birthday. To account for the fact that a
year has either 365 or 366 days, rather
than 360, the six intervals farthest from
the birthday have 31 days rather than 30.

cans. By using more recent reference
works, we were able to find complete
birth and death information for 386 persons. Table 1 shows the results (p =
0.418, far from the 0.025 value reported
by Phillips).

We next turned to three additional
samples analyzed by Phillips: persons
listed in both Who Was Who in America
(1943, 1950, 1960) and in a U.S. appendix to Royalty, Peerage and Aristocracy
of the World (1970). Phillips’ three Who
Was Who samples are based on every
name in the 1951-1960 edition, every
name in the 1943-1950 edition, and
every other name in the 1897-1942 edition. In each case, the surnames had to be
listed in the Royalty appendix, and persons who appear in more than one volume or in Four Hundred Notable Americans were not included a second time. In
addition, his 1943-1950 sample excludes
those who died during World War II and
his 1897-1942 sample excludes those
who died during either World War.

We followed Phillips’ rules, though
many seem to be decisions that could have
been made after looking at the data rather
than before. For example, Phillips justifies
his focus on famous people by arguing
that their birthdays may be celebrated publicly with considerable attention. In the
United States, fame is not noticeably diminished by the absence of one’s name
from the Royalty appendix’s list of aristocratic families. Indeed, it could be argued
that those who made it into Who Was Who
without the benefit of an aristocratic surname are more likely to be well-known
persons whose birthdays are celebrated
publicly than are those who have nothing
more going for them than their surname.

Similarly, while it is reasonable to exclude combat deaths, Who Was Who does

not tell us whether the person died in
combat, and it seems unlikely that a soldier who died in combat had accomplished enough in an abbreviated life to
be listed in Who Was Who. Most of those
excluded by Phillips are almost surely not
combat deaths.

It is noteworthy that Phillips did not
exclude those who did not have aristocratic surnames or who died during these
two world wars from his Four Hundred
Notable Americans data, nor did he exclude from any of his samples those who
died during time periods spanned by
other wars—including the Revolutionary
War, Civil War, Spanish-American War,
and Korean War. While it is unlikely that
any of these decisions, by themselves, introduce systematic biases into the results,
it is likely that the testing of many subsets of any collection of data will yield
spurious coincidental relationships. In
collecting the data, we were also struck
by the very large number of published
compilations of notable people; a determined data miner could surely find a sub
set of some compilation that confirms almost any theory.

Phillips reports that each of his Who
Was Who samples showed a deathdip in
the month preceding the birthmonth. We
did not find this deathdip. In two of the
three samples, the number of deaths in
the month preceding the birthday was
larger than expected—the opposite of
Phillips’ theory—though none of the results are statistically persuasive. The only
sample to show a deathdip has a p value
of 0.99. Table 1 shows the combined results for the three Who Was Who samples
and for all four samples. The 0.051 p
value for the four combined samples is
very close to statistical significance at the
5 per cent level. Similarly, Monte Carlo
simulations show that, were the null hypothesis true, there is a 0.04 probability
that one category would have 148 or
more observations while another has 97
or fewer.

We did find, as did Phillips, a relatively large number of deaths in the
months following the birthday. However,

contrary to Phillips, we also found a relatively large number of deaths in the
month preceding the birthday. One explanation for this rise in deaths in the month
preceding and the months following the
birthdate is that, rather than postponing

death until after the birthday, the anxiety
associated with this milestone and the excesses associated with its celebration are
sometimes fatal. Another explanation is
that Phillips’ results are just a fluke created by a selective use of data.
