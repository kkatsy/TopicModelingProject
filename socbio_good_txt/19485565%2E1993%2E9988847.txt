ABSTRACT: The recent suggestion that typically masculinized sex ratios at birth in Micronesian
populations may be related to a distinct ‘‘Micronesian pattern” of life-course coital behavior is
applied to data on the sex ratio of livebirths on Butaritari Atoll in Kiribati. The data show that
sex ratios on Butaritari are highly masculinized and do not vary significantly with changes in
maternal age. However, there is a discernible relationship between the length of closed intervals
preceding male and female births. The lack of age-related change in sex ratios in the Butaritari
sample is inconsistent with ethnographic data regarding levels of marital coital activity in
relation to increasing age and marriage duration. The Butaritari sex ratio data is argued to
support the suggestion of a ‘“‘Micronesian pattern,” although it is posed that further tests of this

association are required.

In this same journal issue (pp. 200206), Jane Underwood proposes that
indications of a typically masculinized
sex ratio at birth in Micronesian populations may be related to a distinctive
‘“‘Micronesian pattern” of marital coital activity (also Underwood 1990;
1993b). This suggestion is based in part
on her own historical demographic reconstructions of secondary sex ratios
(SSR) of the Chamorro population of
Guam and comparison with other published sex ratio data from the region.
For the Guam case Underwood
(1993a) argues:

I suggest that the increasing level of SSR
with parity and parental age among
Guamanian married couples most likely
reflects a distinctive behavioral pattern
in which coital frequencies remained
high throughout married women’s reproductive years—an _ interpretation
consistent with retrospective ethnographic data.

She also comments:

Only further studies in relatively more
traditional Micronesian societies can
confirm the suggested Micronesian pattern of continuing high levels of sexual
activity regardless of age or marital duration responsible for elevated SSR so
far reported for populations in this part
of the Pacific (p. 206).

To test further Underwood’s proposition, this paper reports on sex ratios at birth for the Micronesian atoll
population of Butaritari in the Republic of Kiribati..The examination of
this particular Micronesian case has
two key advantages. First, this population is, as Underwood suggests, “‘relatively more traditional.” Second, a
detailed description of marital sexual
activity exists for this group (Brewis,
1992a; 19926), and demographic data
can be combined with ethnographic
data in drawing conclusions about the

relationship between sex ratios and coital activity patterns.

THE IMPUTED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
SEX RATIOS AT BIRTH AND COITAL
ACTIVITY

Variations in the number of males to
females born, termed the secondary
sex ratio (SSR) or sex ratio at birth,
have been suggested to occur within
and between human populations in association with a multitude of factors.
These include “race” (James, 1985a;
Teitlebaum, 1972), birth order, and
sexual composition of previous births
(Chahnazarian, 1988; James, 1987, pp.
728-729), parental exposure to such
infectious diseases as measles and hepatitis B (Drew et al., 1986; Langaney
and Pison, 1979), and maternal smoking behavior (James, 1987, p. 734).!
Further, secondary sex ratios do not
reflect only sex ratios at conception
(the primary sex ratio or PSR), but also
sex-differential mortality during gestation. The points in a pregnancy at
which various factors influence sex ratios have proved difficult to isolate with
any precision. Sex selective differences
in prenatal mortality could hypothetically produce a SSR quite different to
the PSR (e.g., Chahnazarian, 1988).
Data on karyotypic sex in spontaneous
abortion suggest that PSR and SSR
may be quite comparable (Stinson,
1985). However, such studies are
plagued by the problems of identifying
and sampling pregnancy losses in the
early post-conception period—the
phase in which embryonic death is par

ticularly closely tied to chromosomal
abnormality (Chahnazarian, 1988, pp.
217-218).

Despite the problems of controlling
for the variety of factors which may affect human SSR and isolating the connection between PSR and SSR, it appears possible a relationship between
intercourse frequency and sex of offspring may exist. This idea has been explored and developed with greatest
force in the work of James (e.g., 1971;
1976; 1983; 1986; 1987). It appears that
conceptions occurring earlier or later
in the fertile portion of the maternal
cycle are more likely to be male, following a U-shaped distribution (Guerrero, 1974; James, 1983). Thus, this
model poses that couples having more
frequent intercourse would be more
likely to produce a conception early in
the ovulatory phase, and therefore to
display a higher (more masculinized)
sex ratio at birth.

The proximate mechanisms that
may account for this relationship between timing of intercourse (and, by
association, its frequency) and production of male offspring are not clear,
given the difficulties of experimental
testing of hypotheses and a resultant
reliance on retrospective data (Levin,
1987). Possibilities include cyclic variations in vaginal or cervical ph affecting X versus Y chromosome motility
or survival (Guerrero, 1975; Roberts,
1978), differential survival of male or
female conceptions resulting from conceptions involving over-ripe ova and
spermatozoa (Harlap, 1979), coitusinduced ovulation (Bartos, 1980), and
cyclic variations in parental hormone
levels around ovulation (James, 1989;
1990).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE SAMPLE

The Butaritari data on sex of births
described herein is based on reproductive history interviews for 201 women
resident in Butaritari village in 1990.2
These interviews produced data on 636
livebirths, of which 631 are of known,
confirmed sex. Birth registrations for
the island were also collated, providing
information on the sex of 5,470 livebirths for the years 1898-1988.3 As
birth registrations are absent or incomplete for some years, here the sample
derived in reproductive histories is
judged likely to be more accurate. Specific effort was made in interviews to
probe for births which may have been
otherwise unreported, such as those
dying in the first few hours or days after
birth.

There is no evidence of any sexselective memory bias in mothers, as
cross-checked with other sources, such
as vital registrations and village clinic
records. This finding is in keeping with
a lack of cultural bias to a specific preference for either sons or daughters—
both of which are highly valued in Butaritari society, albeit for different
reasons (Brewis, 1992a). There is also
no reason to suspect that birth registrations reflect sex-linked underreporting of either male or female neonates.

2Allinterviews were conducted in the vernacular
by the author. See Brewis (1992a) for a protocol description.

3Howell (1990) estimates 1,000 or more births
are required to make reliable inferences about secondary sex ratios. However, Sieff (1990) counters
that the use of reproductive history data overcomes
many of the sampling problems of noninterview
data sets (such as vital registrations), the latter
needing larger sample sizes to raise accuracy to an
“acceptable” level.

Sex Ratios at Birth

209

And, despite the caveat about the
quality of vital registration records, the
sex ratio reported for births reported
in reproductive histories of 111.0 is
not markedly different from the ratio
of 114.1 calculated from the vital registrations.4 Although ‘“‘expected values”’ for human groups fall in the range
of 104-107 (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971), these figures are within
the range of SSR calculated for other
Polynesian and Micronesian groups, as
shown in Table 1. This result indicates
the figures are in no way extraordinary
in the Micronesia-Polynesia region,
even though they are pronouncedly
masculinized.

RESULTS

The Butaritari reproductive history
data on sex of offspring were broken
down by parental age, order of birth,
and length of the interval between
births. SSR variation by maternal and
paternal age at the time of the birth is
presented in Table 2. Only cases in
which parental age could be ascertained with some certainty (N = 631
and N= 521, respectively) are included. SSR of offspring born to
women aged under 30 years is 107.8,
lower than that of 117.7 for offspring
born to mothers at age 30 and above.
Although a possible trend to increasing
masculinity with age of mother may
exist, there is no Statistical difference
in offspring sex between those born
to women under thirty or those age
thirty or above (x? = 0.243, df = 1,
p = 0.622). A possible reverse trend

may exist in relation to paternal age, as
the SSR of offspring of men under 30
years of age is lower than the SSR of
those born to older fathers (112.0 and
104.8, respectively). This association
also proves to have no Statistical significance, however (y? = 0.200, df =
1, p = 0.655). |

SSR variation by birth order for all
livebirths of known sex .(N = 631) is
presented in Table 3. Although conventional wisdom states that SSR tend
to decline with increasing parity (i.e.,
with advancing birth orders) (e.g.,
Sieff, 1990), this pattern is not seen in
the Butaritari sample. Sex ratios are
highest among the middle-order births
rather than the lower-order ones. Although this finding could possibly reflect a bias introduced by the small subsample sizes, the description of a very
similar birth order association in the

 

Guam data (Underwood, 1993, p. 204)
makes it quite possible that the figures
represent a real phenomenon.

When the preceding birth interval is
considered, a more discernible pattern
emerges. For marital births following
intervals in which spousal separation
or partner change did not occur and
no overt pregnancy limitation was attempted (N = 517), the SSR displays
a trend of increasing femininity as
preceding birth interval duration increases, aS shown in Table 4. There is
a significant difference between the
mean interval preceding male births
of 28.04 months (SD = 19.43, N=
270), and the mean of 31.48 months
(SD = 20.11, MN =247) preceding
female births (t= 1.974, df = 515,
p = 0.049). A statistically significant
difference is also seen in the sex of

CONCLUSION

If we assume, following James’
proposition, that couples having more
frequent acts of coitus have increased
probabilities of producing sons, the
masculinized SSR from Butaritari reflects fairly high coital rates. Specifically, as SSR does not decline with maternal age and may even display a trend
toward increase, on the basis of SSR
data it is possible to infer that coital activity is being maintained with advancing maternal age and, in association,
with increasing marriage duration.

If this finding is augmented with the
argument that couples engaging in
more frequent unprotected acts of coitus would be expected to conceive
sooner and therefore to have shorter
birth intervals, then lower sex ratios
would be expected to be associated
with longer birth intervals. The Butaritarl case demonstrates just this—a
significant difference in sex of offspring
associated with time from the last
birth, with female births predominat
ing after longer birth intervals and vice
versa.

Such an argument solely based on
SSR inferences has many possible
flaws, including the possibly confounding influence of hepatitis B infection
(Drew et al., 1986), this infection being
prevalent in Kiribati (Tibbs, 1987).
However, the ethnographic data from
Butaritari provides strength to this putative SSR-coital-activity relationship.
As is described in detail elsewhere
(Brewis, 1992a), marital coital frequency is maintained at fairly high levels in Butaritari society despite advancing female age and increasing marriage
duration. A comparable situation is
described for the Chamorros of Guam
by Underwood (1993a; 1993b), where
couples are continuing regular sexual
activity with advancing age. Further,
demographic data on fertility performance demonstrate little reduction in
livebirth production or increase in secondary infertility in susceptible women
before they reach their forties and with
increasing marriage duration in both
the Guam (Underwood, 1990) and
Butaritari (Brewis, 1993) populations.
With such concordance between ethnographic and demographic data in
these two Micronesian examples, it is
quite possible that regional SSR’s may

reflect coital activity patterns in relation to maternal age in a real way.

Certainly, the Butaritari case supports Underwood’s (1993a) suggestion
that a distinct ““Micronesian pattern”
of maintenance of coital activity with
age may exist. Additional testing in
other “relatively more traditional” Micronesian populations would further
clarify the possibility of such a Micronesian pattern of coital activity and
help to determine if SSR provide a key
marker of such a biobehavioral complex.

As mentioned earlier, Polynesian
groups also typically display highly
masculinized SSR. It does appear from
the limited evidence available that pronounced masculinity in SSR may be
the norm for both Pacific regions. Fol

lowing this observation, it is possible
that Polynesian groups could follow a
similar SSR by age pattern. Comparable demographic-ethnographic data
sets from other island-based groups in
the “‘Polynesia triangle” are required
to test if the Micronesian pattern
may also apply in Polynesia, whether
through the whole region or in smaller
atoll-based groups.
