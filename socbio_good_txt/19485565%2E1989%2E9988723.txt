Development, “Welfare,” and Fertility:

A Simple Macroanalysis

ABSTRACT: Accepting the theoretical position that desired family size is likely to diminish as
economic modernization occurs, the author analyzes the association between fertility and
development using recent national data from less developed countries. Measures of income and
equality are combined to provide an index of population “welfare.” Multiple and cross-lagged
correlations are used to demonstrate the magnitude and nature of the relationship between
welfare and fertility rates. Despite inadequacies of the data, high negative correlations are
obtained, and evidence is advanced to show that the direction of causation is from welfare to

fertility.

Much demographic discussion has
been focused on microanalytical models
(e.g., Caldwell, 1983; Easterlin and
Crimmins, 1985) which have examined
the mechanisms that relate development to lowered fertility. A persuasive
case has been made that, for the individual couple, fertility is a rational decision
based on the economic costs and
benefits of children, and that with development children come to cost more and
return less (Murdoch, 1980). If development is unevenly distributed within a
country, it will have a reduced effect on
fertility. Thus, high birth rates among
the rural poor may conceal fertility reduction in urban areas (Bhattacharyya
1975).

Relatively few macroanalyses of the
association between development and
fertility have been published in the
eighties. A paper by Omran and Salama
(1986) draws attention to the variability
of the phenomenon, but uses data from
before 1975. This contribution updates
the analysis with international data from

the period 1978-87. Readily available
indices are used to increase the size of
the study group, despite the exclusion of
the developed countries which now
have uniformly low fertility rates. Development is assessed in terms of per
capita income, supplemented by a measure of equality, as suggested by Murdoch (1980). For convenience, the combination of national per capita income
and equality is referred to as ‘‘welfare.”
The prediction of fertility by welfare is
assessed using a lagged model as suggested by Oechsli and Kirk (1975). The
residual effect of culture is also evaluated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data were obtained primarily from
the Population Reference Bureau
World Population Data Sheets for 1979
and 1987. Eight years was accepted as
an appropriate time lag over which economic conditions might be expected to

affect reproductive behavior. An arbitrary figure of $5,000 was adopted as the
upper limit of per capita Gross National
Product (PCP) for a Less Developed
Country (LCD) in 1987. Of all countries
listed, 19 were excluded on the basis of
high PCP; 60 LCD’s were excluded because of incomplete data. A study group
of 94 countries remained.
Total Fertility Rate (TFR) was used
i 3s the measure of fertility to avoid the
= population structure bias incorporated
‘‘ in Crude Birth Rates. TFR87 was taken
© from the Data Sheet; TFR79 was estio mated by multiplying the Gross Repro2 duction Rates given in the United Nase tions Demographic Yearbook of 1981
a by a factor of 2.07 (the majority of these
co Statistics referred to 1978 censuses). The
~ per capita Gross National Product
= (PCP) supplied by the Data Sheets was
& used as the measure of income; it must
"5 be recognized that it also reflects urban= ization and the degree to which the pop‘6 ulation has moved from a subsistence to
£ a monetary economy.
g Measures of equality are less generally available; there are no recent figures
—. for income distribution in the majority
& of LCD’s. The Infant Mortality Rate
2 (IMR) is widely available and is a mea= sure of equality in that the rich in most
E countries can achieve low levels of in2 fant loss while the poor cannot. Of
© course, IMR itself has a direct effect on
fertility. The higher the IMR, the more
births needed by a couple to achieve a
given family size. However, it was felt
that IMR, entered in a multiple regression equation after PCP, was a relatively
clean indicator of equality. What is being used here is the variance in IMR not
predicted by PCP. A couple’s reproductive behavior can hardly be influenced
by the extent to which the IMR in their
country differs from that predicted by

the country’s PCP. Our measure of
equality is the error term in the PCP/
IMR regression and will be referred to
as ERR. Infant Mortality Rates were
obtained from the Data Sheets.

Finally, as a rough measure of cultural affiliation, countries were assigned
to one of five groups (North Africa and
the Middle East; West, East and South
Africa; Asia and Oceana; Central
America and the Carribean and South
America; Europe).

The basic measure of association was
a regression of fertility on measures of
welfare. A scattergram of TFR87 with
PCP87 suggests an exponential relationship. Asa result, it was decided to transform TFR so as to produce the optimal
linear relationship as measured by the
ratio between the slope of the first and
second half of the curve. A initial ratio
of 2.5 was reduced to 1.13 by using the
Reciprocal Square Root of the TFR
(rrTFR), and this transform was
adopted for the analysis.

Data analysis began with the creation
of a multiple regression equation with
rrTFR87 as the dependent variable. The
independent variables were the measures of economic welfare from 1979
(PCP79 and ERR79) and the dummy
variables representing cultural groupings. This was seen as a demonstration
of the existence and strength of the
welfare/fertility correlation, along with
an estimate of the influence of culture
once welfare was controlled.

The second step was a cross-lagged
correlation in which measures of welfare
for both 1979 and 1987 were related to
the fertility rates, and also for 1979 and
1987. This step was seen as a test of the
proposition that the direction of causality is from welfare to fertility rather than
the reverse. This statistical manipulation requires that the sample be of mod

erate size, that the variables indeed
vary, that the effect is lagged, and that
the synchronous correlations be moderate (Kenny, 1975). These criteria are
met by our data. In addition, Kenny
notes the need for “stationarity,” the
stability of the causal structure over
time, and “synchronicity,” the use of
measures actually collected at the specified time. There is no reason to suppose that the factors causal of fertility
should have altered over the last two
decades, but there is some doubt about
the dates to which the data refer. National information from a given year
represents the most recent survey with
or without subsequent projections of
change. Furthermore, variation may be
nonrandom, influenced, for example,
by UN census projects.

RESULTS

Calculation revealed a close correla
tion between fertility rates and the indi
cators of welfare. The bivariate correlation between rrTFR87 and PCP79 was
0.712. The coefficient of multiple correlation when ERR79 was added to the
equation was 0.856. Thus, the welfare
indicators account for 73 per cent of the
variation in fertility rates. Curiously,
this is exactly the figure obtained by
Murdoch (1980), using different, but

analogous, data. When the four dummy
variables representing cultural affiliation were added, the explained variance
increased to 79 per cent. The attained
significance of all correlations, including
the final 6 per cent increase is better than
one in a thousand (p < 0.001).

The correlations necessary for crosslagged comparison are presented in Table 1. The synchronous correlations are
similar (0.810 and 0.817), giving empirical support to the assumption of stationarity of causation. They also suggest
that the use of different sources of TFR
for the two dates has not introduced any
systematic distortion. Readers will note
that reversing the time sequence reduces the observed correlation between
fertility and welfare indicators from
0.856 to 0.764. Kenny (1975) gives a formula for calculating the significance of
such a change. However, this formula
requires a single correlation between
both welfare variables in 1979 and both
in 1987. If the variabJes are separately
correlated across time and the mean
used, the cross-lagged comparison attains a significance of p = 0.003.

CONCLUSION

Given our theoretical perspective,
the figures confirm our expectation that
the economic welfare of a population is
