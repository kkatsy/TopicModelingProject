Change in Africa: Toward a More

Appropriate Economic Approach

ABSTRACT: Evidence suggests that in contemporary Africa, and probably in the predemographic transition periods of many other populations, desired fertility typically exceeds (or exceeded) achieved fertility and completed family size. The main conceptual approaches employed by economists during the past two decades for the analysis of the determinants of fertility
are reviewed and found inadequate because most fail to address circumstances in which demand or desired fertility exceeds supply or actual fertility. An alternative conceptual framework is offered incorporating both demand and supply determinants. Results from numerous
studies of African and other populations are found to be consistent with this approach. Data
from Tanzania are described and analyzed. Implications of this micro-level conceptual approach for macro-level fertility change are suggested.

This paper elaborates a conceptual
framework for analyzing the determinants of fertility and fertility change in
developing countries and illustrates this
conceptual framework with data from
Africa as well as from studies of other
premodern populations. It reviews the
main conceptual approaches used by
economists during the past two decades
for analyzing the determinants of fertility. Because this work focused primarily
on the determinants of demand for children, much of this work has had only
limited relevance for high fertility populations in general. Nevertheless, economic concepts offer potentially powerful and useful insights for understanding
the processes by which fertility changes
and for assessing the relative contributions of various biological and behavioral phenomena affecting fertility.

The economic framework described
here is more adequate than conven
41

tional economic approaches for conceptualizing the conditions which determine completed family size and for
showing how these conditions may
change as a consequence of changing
cultural, social, and economic characteristics of those parents, extended families, and communities which are part of
modernizing societies. The focus is on
African populations, but the approach
may be relevant for non-African populations as well. This analysis will be limited to marital fertility and, to simplify
the discussion and analysis, will concentrate on the perspective of mothers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DEMAND ANALYSIS

Although economists have been interested in the determinants of fertility
and family size—and causal relation

ships with economic growth—at least
since Malthus, comprehensive and systematic economic analyses of fertility in
developing countries date only from the
late 1950’s. Most of the early work of
Leibenstein (1957), Coale and Hoover
(1958), and Enke (1960, 1966) focused
on the macro-economic consequences
of high fertility and high populationgrowth rates.

However, the pioneering conceptual

cand theoretical contributions of Leiben‘stein (1957) and Becker (1960) also
‘stimulated substantial work on the
“micro-economics of fertility, although
Cmost of the theoretical developments,
enodeling, and research have been
Sconfined to “demand analysis.”” The two
cdominant approaches to demand analyssis which emerged in the 1960’s were
“hose of Gary Becker and Richard EasSerlin. According to the Becker apSree fertility falls because the price
ffects (price being negatively related to
ertility) exceed the income effects (in‘ome being positively related to fertilty) (see Becker, 1960, 1965; Becker and
‘Lewis, 1973). That is, as a result of so“eloeconomic improvements, the aspira“tions that parents have for their children
Sause them to undertake substantially
@reater child-related expenditures as
Stheir incomes rise. This increases the
costs per child thereby reducing demand
(number desired), and this reduced demand more than offsets any increase in
demand due to rising incomes.

Becker assumed that real preferences
of parents do not change. Only incomes
and prices change, and usually the price
effect dominates. However, a rise in income (due to a rise in wage rates) is also
expected to have some negative effect
on demand for children, because as income rises the value of the time which
parents spend on their children also

rises, thus further increasing the price of
children (Becker, 1960; Leibenstein,
1957; Schultz, 1973).

In the case of children, there are important conceptual problems in defining
a “good.” What superficially appear to
be similar goods may be perceived by
the relevant consumers as being several
different goods. Are female and male
babies similar goods, and do they provide equivalent levels of utility? (Here
utility means satisfaction, enjoyment, or
enhanced social status, but it does not
include financial value or wealth, since
these latter effects would be expressed
through prices of children relative to
prices of other things.) Does an uneducated child provide utility equivalent to
that derived from an educated child?
Does a second, or seventh, son provide
utility equivalent to that from a first son?
These complications led to incorporating into the analysis distinctions between child “quality” and “quantity”
(see Becker and Lewis, 1973; Becker
and Tomes, 1976; and Cochrane, 1975).
Thus, while two uneducated sons may
be perceived as equivalent goods, an educated son would be a different good.

Subsequently this body of work came
to be known collectively as the “‘new
home economics”’ (Nerlove, 1974).
Practitioners of the “new home economics” proceeded under the implicit
assumption that the number of children
parents have is also the number they
want, i.e., that supply of children and
demand for children are in equilibrium.
The methodologies used generally did
not include variables which might give
some indication whether or not supply
and demand were in equilibrium, and if
not, why not.

Much of the demand analysis research for developing-country populations was undertaken during the early

Vol. 30, No. 1

1970’s when most KAP (knowledge, attitude, and practice) studies—with the
exception of those carried out in
Africa—were showing that achieved
family size generally exceeded desired
family size. This finding implied that
parents perceived an excess supply of
children, that is, presuming the responses were valid, supply of children
and demand for children were apparently not in equilibrium. Recent research carried out in a large number of
developing countries under the auspices
of the World Fertility Survey also shows
that for a large portion of respondents,
achieved family size substantially exceeds desired family size (see, for example, Westoff, 1981).

The distinctive feature of the original
Easterlin formulations is that changing
aspirations (‘‘tastes and preferences’)
are possibly a dominant cause of declining parental demand for children (Easterlin, 1966, 1969). Over time, aspirations for non-child goods and services
may be increasing relative to aspirations
for children. In this interpretation, aspirations of parents are determined by
their backgrounds and experiences, particularly during childhood socialization.
As aspirations change from one generation to another, as a consequence of socioeconomic modernization or upward
social mobility, the average number of
children parents want may change as a
result of their trying to satisfy desires for
both children and other acquisitions
within the constraints imposed by their
financial and other resources.

Sanderson (1976) provides a comparison of the Becker and Easterlin approaches. He notes a convergence during the 1970’s, including the
introduction in 1976 of the following
somewhat similar concepts: Easterlin
(1976) now includes the desire of par
Fertility Change in Africa

43

ents to leave a suitable “wealth bequest” to their children—assumed to be
equivalent in real ternis to what they received from their own parents—as a potentially important determinant of demand for children. The model
developed by Becker and Tomes (1976)
incorporates as a determinant of the
price of children the level of ‘“‘child endowment” desired by parents, a concept
similar to Easterlin’s desired bequest.
However, Easterlin expects desired bequests to be determined by parental aspirations formed during childhood and
thus unrelated to their incomes as
adults, while Becker expects desired
levels of expenditures per child (the endowment factor) to be positively related
to parental income. The Becker models
have not yet explicitly incorporated the
possibility of changing aspirations
(tastes) over time.

Representing yet a third “‘school,”’
Leibenstein (1974, 1975) offers a
broader concept and meaning for the
utility and dis-utility provided by children and how these affect demand. He
also stresses the limitations in treating
acquisition of children in conventional
economic (market) terms; the importance of tastes and preferences and their
formation; and the need to broaden the
theories to specifically incorporate culturally and socially imposed constraints
(one of which he terms “‘social influence
group’) on the capacity and/or willingness of individuals to actually make and
implement choices in specific life situations (see also Leibenstein, 1977).

INCORPORATING SUPPLY VARIABLES INTO
THE ANALYSIS

Economists have long recognized
that acquisition of most goods is a function of both demand characteristics and
supply conditions. However, as noted

44

earlier, most economic analyses of determinants of the acquisition of children
have proceeded on the implicit assumption that demand characteristics dominate and that supply conditions are sufficiently unimportant in determining the
number of children that they can be ignored.

A principal objective of Easterlin’s
early work was to synthesize economic
and sociological approaches to provide a
fuller understanding of the causes of fertility change. This effort directed considerable attention to the role of aspirations and when and how they are
acquired. However, it also drew attention to characteristics which in economic
terms affect the production or supply of
children, such as fecundity, frequency of
intercourse, and the use and efficacy of
specific fertility control methods, both
traditional and modern.

Subsequently Easterlin and others
have explicitly incorporated the determinants of the supply (or production) of
children into economic models and analyses of the determinants of fertility
(e.g., Easterlin, 1975, 1978; Kocher,
1977; Jejeebhoy, 1978; Lesthaeghe et
al., 1981). This revision permits the
analysis of circumstances in which the
supply of children (actual number of
children a parent has) and demand for
children (number of children desired)
may be unequal, i.e., in disequilibrium.

At any point in the childbearing period, including at its conclusion and possibly later as well, each individual parent
may perceive herself or himself as being
in one of the following three conditions
with respect to the relationship between
the number of living children she or he
would like to have and the number she
or he actually has.:

1. Desired number exceeds the actual
number (excess demand).

Kocher

Social Biology

2. Desired number and actual number
are identical (supply-demand equilibrium),

3. Actual number exceeds desired number (excess supply).

“Determinants of supply” are the biological and cultural/behavioral factors
that directly affect conception, gestation, childbirth, and child survival.
“Supply of children” here means simply
either the actual number of children
born or the number surviving. It would
include the results of any intentional efforts to space, limit, or terminate childbearing, and in this it differs from the
concept “natural fertility’’ which refers
to levels of childbearing which occur in
the absence of any deliberate effort—
regardless of parity—to limit total
births. Many supply determinants are
the so-called intermediate variables first
described systematically by Davis and
Blake (1956). For purposes of this argument, the supply variables affecting fertility can be conceptualized under three
categories:

1. Those which determine the age at
which childbearing commences;

2. Those which affect birth spacing;

3. Those which determine the termination of childbearing.

Intermediate supply variables which
may be important determinants of the
age at which childbearing commences
include biological determinants of age
of menarche and cultural determinants
of the age at which a woman first has coitus and its frequency thereafter. Intermediate supply variables which may determine the date of termination of
childbearing include the biologically determined age of menopause; social and
cultural norms governing widow remarriage (or lack of same); the changing frequency of intercourse (including terminal abstinence) as related to the age of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 30, No. 1

the woman and her husband; and possibly the ages and marital statuses of her
children.

Intermediate supply variables that
are potential determinants of the spacing between births include the following
(see Bongaarts, 1978, 1981):

1. Lactational infecundability.

2. Frequency of intercourse (including
sexual abstinence).

3. Sterility.

4, Spontaneous intrauterine mortality.

Frequency of intercourse may in turn
be affected by non~demand-related factors such as both voluntary and involuntary separation of spouses and prolonged periods of sexual abstinence due
to lactational or other culturallydetermined taboos.

CHANGING DISEQUILIBRIA:
ILLUSTRATING THE HYPOTHESES

The discussion to this point has been
primarily limited to the possible effects
of intermediate supply and demand variables on fertility. However, presumably
the number of surviving children is ultimately of greater importance to parents
than the number of children born, and
supply and demand can also be conceptualized in terms of surviving children.

Figure 1 is an illustration of hypothesized relationships between supply of
surviving children and demand for surviving children for typical women who
have completed childbearing. The
figure illustrates hypothesized changes
in the relative relationships between
supply and demand over time as a traditional society undergoes socioeconomic
modernization.

As illustrated in the figure, it is hypothesized that in traditional African
societies, women typically want more
surviving children than they actually end

Fertility Change in Africa 45

up with; that is, they experience excess
demand. Ware (1975), for example,
identified 33 KAP and other surveys
carried out in tropical Africa during the
1960’s, all of which indicated that desired numbers of children were very
high. In all these studies the vast majority of respondents wanted five or more
children. A recent national survey in
Kenya found that 76 per cent of all
women respondents wanted six or more
children (Dow and Werner, 1982).
However, it is further hypothesized that
during the initial phases of socioeconomic, cultural, and demographic transition, women typically have larger
numbers of surviving children than previously while the number of surviving
children that the typical women would
like to have may be smaller than previously, so that eventually women find
themselves in excess supply situations.

This is, therefore, a model which postulates the transformation from a traditional society in which women typically
have lower fertility than they desire to a
modernizing society in which women
typically have excess fertility. Tabbarah
(1971) was probably the first to advance
such a mode]. The process by which this
profound transformation takes place is
not simple, probably varies greatly from
place to place, and will certainly vary
from woman to woman. Nonetheless,
evidence from Africa is increasingly
consistent with the broad outlines
sketched here, and some of the underlying causal relationships are suggested
below in the form of hypotheses.

It is hypothesized that in traditional
societies the number of surviving children that women end up with is determined (or constrained) by intermediate
supply variables. However, one initial
consequence of economic, educational,
and health improvements is to cause

changes in intermediate fertility variables (e.g., post-partum sexual abstinence, duration of breastfeeding, incidence of fetal wastage) which result in
an increase in the supply of surviving

as (3 in Figure 1. The onset of decline in

typical woman is presumed to come
‘about only after a prolonged period of

conclude that they would be better off
with somewhat fewer surviving children
than the number desired in the past.
Possible specific causes of declining demand are numerous and varied and will
not be discussed at length here. These
causes are discussed in one form or another by the conventional demand
analysis literature referred to earlier and
include rising incomes, rising relative
prices of children, and rising opportu

nity cost of women’s time. Changing
tastes and preferences may also be important but are often excluded from
conventional demand analyses.

Point e (supply and demand equilibrium) in Figure 1 can be located almost
anywhere prior to £4. Its location is simply the coincidence of actual and desired
numbers of surviving children being
equal. Its significance is that two very
different disequilibria are found on either side. To the left, D exceeds S, and
women would presumably do whatever
they could to increase the number of
surviving children. To the right of e, s
exceeds D, and women would presumably want to hold down fertility.

Note that the model illustrated in Figure 1 does not indicate what is happening to fertility in the period between 12
and t4. The dependent variable in the
model is number of surviving children.
Until point t4 is reached, fertility could
be rising, falling, or about constant, depending on the net effect of those intermediate variables tending to reduce fertility and those tending to raise it; £4 is
identified as the point at which women
begin to restrict fertility for the specific
reason that they want no more children,
and it is only subsequent to this point
that fertility unambiguously declines.

Note also that Figure 1 illustrates two
(of several) possible variations in the
timing and sequencing of supply and demand changes. In (a), D starts to decline
only after S exceeds D (i.e., excess supply) while in (b), D begins to decline
while it still exceeds S (excess demand).
Another pattern might be a declining D
prior to a rising S. In fact, D could decline to below S (excess supply) before S$
rises, and indeed § need not rise at all.
This version of the model might be appropriate to areas where fertility began
to decline—implying excess supply—

before or concurrently with the beginning of mortality decline (the eventual
mortality decline would of course partially offset the decline in § produced by
falling fertility).

RESULTS
A SURVEY OF SOME EVIDENCE

Caldwell, in his reformulation of demographic transition theory, essentially
argues that African as well as Middle
Eastern and South Asian data support
the supply constraint hypothesis
(Caldwell, 1976, 1977, 1978). He does
so by the indirect route of stressing the
strong demand for children in tropical
Africa, emphasizing the contributions
that children make, both economic and
socio-psychological, to the welfare of
both parents and the larger community.
He concludes that in traditional rural
African societies the net transfer of societal resources is from younger to older
generations. So long as an additional
child is a net asset to the parents, demand will exceed supply.

Although Caldwell provides persuasive evidence and analysis supporting
the intergenerational wealth-flows hypothesis and its effect on demand for
children, it is not necessarily the case
that parental demand for children will
remain undiminished so long as children
continue to be net financial assets to parents. It is also possible that an additional
child may be a net financtal asset while
being at the same time a psychological
or physical burden—a liability in nonfinancial terms. If the psychological and/
or physical burden is perceived as being
of greater importance than are financial
considerations, the mother may prefer
to avoid another birth even if she thinks
the net financial contribution of another
would be positive. The opposite is also a

 

 

Social Biology

possibility. An additional child may be
perceived as a net financial liability but a
net socio-psychological asset. The parent may want an additional birth if the
importance of the latter outweighs the
financial considerations.

Additional support for this model is
provided by a recent analysis by Dow
and Werner (1982) of a 1977-78 national fertility study in Kenya. The sample of 8,100 women ages 15—50 was segmented into the following categories:

Traditional: women who desired 6 or
more children and had never used an
efficient method of contraception
(67.6 per cent of the total).

Transitional (28.0 per cent of the total
sample): (a) women who desired 6 or
more children but had used an efficient method of contraception (8.2
per cent of the total), and (b) women
who desired fewer than 6 children but
had never used an efficient method
(19.8 per cent).

Modern: women who desired fewer than
6 children and had used an efficient
method of contraception (4.4 per cent
of the total).

Modern and transitional women in
general were younger, better educated,
had better educated husbands, and were
less likely to be in polygynous unions.
As also expected, a higher proportion of
urban than of rural women were in the
transitional and modern categories. The
proportion of women who have these
characteristics is increasing rather rapidly in Kenya, and therefore presumably
the proportion of women in the transitional and modern categories is also increasing although the study was unable
to determine the rate of change.

During the 1960’s and 1970’s the total
fertility rate in Kenya rose from about
6.5 to over 8.0 (Mott and Mott, 1980).
This was at a time when the proportion
of “‘modern”’ and “transitional”? women
(see above) was increasing. These two

 
Vol. 30, No. 1

apparently contradictory developments
are consistent with the hypothesis that
fertility in Africa—in this case, Kenya—
has been primarily determined, and
constrained, by intermediate supply
variables rather than demand variables.
Other analysts have also found strong
evidence that fertility in traditional and
early fertility-transition populations is
determined or constrained primarily by
intermediate supply variables. These

& § conclusion that in the pre-Meiji period

Additional data consistent with this
analysis are derived from a study of
about 1,500 households in four rural areas in northeastern Tanzania. Table 1
summarizes selected socioeconomic,
educational, and demographic data for
these populations obtained from interviews with adult household members.

The study was carried out in four
well-watered, fertile, and denselysettled rural communities; two (L1 and
L2) are located in Lushoto district and

Fertility Change in Africa 49

two (M1 and M2) in Moshi district. At
the time the data were collected (late
1973) there were about 1,000 households and 5,000 people in each of the
four areas. The areas ranged in size from
about 7 to 10 square kilometers with average densities of 500-700 per square kilometer, although some residents of
each area also cultivated land and
grazed livestock outside the area, so that
the land effectively supporting these
populations was somewhat larger. All
four are located at elevations between
1,050 and 1,850 meters.

Based on accounts of early European
travelers, Christian missionaries, European settlers, and (German) government Officials (all of whom first entered
these areas in the late nineteenth century), these were still traditional rural
African societies as recently as the early
1900’s. Almost all residents adhered to
tribal religions. Formal (Western-style)
schools and medical services were only
beginning to be established. Very little
commercialization of agriculture had
taken place. Birth rates were high—
probably close to 50 per thousand—and
death rates were probably not yet much
below their historic average levels, perhaps 40 per thousand (with average expectations of life at birth not much
above 25 years). Almost no one one had
received any formal education.

However, considerable socioeconomic development and improvements
in living conditions have occurred in all
four areas during this century. By 1973
crude death rates had declined to about
12-15 per thousand, the expectation of
life at birth was 50-55 years, and most
children were receiving at least some
primary education. Most residents no
longer followed traditional religions,
substantial numbers of households (especially in the Moshi area) resided in

50 Kocher

nontraditional and relatively expensive
houses, and almost all households participated in the cash economy although
per capita incomes probably still did not
exceed $100 per year.

These are currently rural societies in
transition. They are clearly not yet “developed,” but they are also no longer
traditional (see Figure 1). There are also
large differentials in the levels and
spread of the changes, both within and
among the four areas, some of which are
refiected in the characteristics shown in
Tables 1 and 2, e.g., formal schooling,
age at first marriage, incidence of polygyny, and duration of breastfeeding.
Generally, the four areas can be ranked,
from the one having experienced the
least change to the one having experienced the most change, as follows: L1,
L2, M1, M2. This is the case, for example, for women’s education (Table 1,
Col. 6 and 7).

Some of the more relevant and notable differences among the areas shown
in Tables 1 and 2 are the following: In
M2 age at marriage has apparently risen
substantially in recent years (Table 1,
Col. 9) and childbearing is now commencing at a later age (Table 1, Col. 4).
Women ages 20-24 had only half as
many live births in M2 as in the other
three areas, while differences among
women ages 25-29 were less pronounced, and M2 women ages 30-34
had slightly more live births than women
in the other areas. Other notable behavioral changes presumably related to
these are the dramatically declining
prevalence of polygyny in M2 (Table 1,
Col. 12) and toa lesser extent in M1 with
apparently little change in L1 and L2,
and the substantial decline in the average duration of breast-feeding (Table 2,
Col. 2-5). The latter may, at least in
part, be the consequence of the demise

 

Social Biology

of prolonged post-partum sexual abstinence, particularly in M2 and possibly
also in M1. A recent study in Northern
Nigeria found that women with some
formal education practiced post-partum
sexual abstinence for a shorter period
than did women with no education (Rehan and Abashiya, 1981).

Respondents in the Tanzania study
were questioned as to whether they
thought that the usual length of breastfeeding had been changing in recent
years. The predominant response was
that it was declining, primarily because
women were resuming sexual intercourse with their husbands sooner after
childbirth and as a result having another
pregnancy sooner and terminating
breast-feeding sooner than had traditionally been the case. However, it was
not possible to recruit female interviewers for this study, and pretesting demonstrated that direct questions concerning
sexual abstinence were too sensitive for
male interviewers to ask of women respondents. In the absence of data on abstinence, duration of breast-feeding
may be considered a proxy (of unknown
reliability) for duration of post-partum
sexual abstinence. Presumably the substantial recent increase in women’s educational attainment, especially in M2, is
another important contributor to all
these behavioral changes.

It is also interesting that perceptions
of declining child mortality seem to be
strongly associated with these other general differences in the extent of social
change. Estimates based on model life
tables indicate that female life expectancy at birth in each of the four study areas was in the 50-55 year range (Table 2,
Col. 6), implying that infant and child
mortality have probably fallen substantially in recent decades in all four areas
(Henin et al., 1977). A large majority of

respondents in both Moshi areas believe
that child mortality has been declining,
but in the Lushoto areas (and particularly L1) the majority believe otherwise
(Cols. 8 and 9). Finally, Cols. 10-12 (Table 2) show that for given numbers of
surviving children, in most cases a
higher proportion of Moshi respondents
desired no more children than did
Lushoto respondents.

These data suggest that in these study
“areas socioeconomic change and educaCtional improvements are associated with
‘ising age at first marriage and first birth,
ut that they are also associated with
ghanges in certain intermediate supply

ariables which on balance result in
Sshorter birth intervals.
“: Table 3 shows the results of a multi‘ple regression analysis in which the deendent variable is the number of live
irths (parity), while two different sets
‘of independent variables are
Spresented—one the so-called “supply

Study areas combined. Both the ‘“‘suply” and “‘demand” independent variales are only imperfect proxies for the
“conceptually correct’’ variables discussed earlier in this paper, and regression results should therefore be viewed
with considerable caution.

The supply regressions support the
observations based on Tables 1 and 2
about the direction of the relationships
between intermediate supply variables
(as measured in this study) and fertility,
and they are consistent with the model

tively related to the number of deceased
children (a proxy for child mortality),
negatively related to duration of breastfeeding, and negatively related to polygyny except for women ages 20-29 where
the relationship is trivial. All relationships except the latter are statistically
significant at the 0.01 level. For women
ages 30-39, the regression results indicate that the independent effect of each
of these “supply” variables on fertility
was the following. Each additional year
of marriage resulted in an additional
0.22 births; each deceased child resulted
in an additional 0.69 births; each additional month of breast-feeding resulted
in 0.037 fewer births, or about 0.45
fewer births for each additional year of
breast-feeding; and the independent effect of a polygynous marriage was that
women in those marriages had about
0.75 fewer births than women in monogamous marriages.

On the other hand, among the socalled ‘“‘demand” variables, only two independent variables show statistically
significant relationships with the dependent variable (parity) among women
ages 20-29, and there are no statistically
significant relationships among women
ages 30-39. Among the former, building
quality index (as a proxy for household
wealth) is positively related to fertility
and women’s formal education is negatively related to fertility—both as hypothesized. It is assumed here that formal education for women alters tastes
and preferences in such a way that the
traditional value of high fertility is diminished. In some conceptual formulations, increased formal education also
increases the opportunity cost to women
of having additional children, but this
factor was probably not yet of much importance in these rural areas.

treated with caution, they are consistent
with the analysis presented earlier in this
paper which concluded that in traditional and early transitional rural Africa
societies, intermediate supply variables
are primarily responsible for determining fertility, and ultimately child survivorship. Demand considerations have
little influence and are at best only weak

reinforcers of the existing fertility disequilibria, with demand for children exceeding supply of children, as in the
cases of the proxy for household wealth
and education of women ages 20-29
(Table 3).

Since the evidence suggests that

nation of fertility, it might be worth noting again that both rising age at first marriage and declining infant and young
child mortality independently reduce
fertility, while declining duration of
breast-feeding (possibly associated with
the demise of prolonged post-partum
sexual abstinence) and the demise of polygyny result in shorter birth intervals
which independently increase fertility.
the “net” fertility effect depends on the
ctelative magnitude of each of these indi“vidual effects. Thus, data on fertility unccompanied by data or information on
¢hanges in these key intermediate sup-ply variables may lead to the conclusion
hat relatively little fertility-affecting

DISCUSSION

RELEVANCE FOR MAcrRO-LEVEL
FERTILITY CHANGE

wnloaded by [Unive

Much of the interest in fertility and

Anortality in developing countries does
not extend to micro-level analyses but is
limited to inspection of fertility levels
and trends of population aggregates at
national, state, or regional levels. Substantial fertility differences are often observed at these aggregate levels. For example, there is clear evidence of rather
large fertility differentials by regions,
ethnic groups, and ecological zones in
Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya (Henin et
al., 1977; Gaisie and de Graft-Johnson,
1974; Faruqee, 1980).

The preceding discussion and analysis, concerned only with micro-level
processes, suggests that the causal relationships which result in a given fertility
level at any particular time are complex
and not subject to easy illumination.
The analysis further suggests that a superficial examination of current fertility
levels and trends which fails to illuminate both absolute and relative changes
in important intermediate fertility variables may produce misleading conclusions about fertility change prospects in
the near and more distant future.

This finding has an important, simple, but often-overlooked implication
concerning the relative shares of the total population in each relevant subgroup. If different subgroups of a population are undergoing different
biological, cultural and socioeconomic
fertility-affecting experiences, the fertility effects at the aggregate-level will be
the product of fertility effects in each
subgroup weighted by the relative proportions of the population found in each
of the subgroups.

This process is particularly important
for populations in which both intermediate supply and demand variables are undergoing change, and for those populations in which intermediate demand
variables are becoming of increasing importance in affecting fertility and in
which some fertility decline is occurring
or is beginning. There is evidence from
experiences of several developing countries, and from cross-sectional analyses
of a large number of countries, consistent with the hypothesis that the rate of
decline in aggregate-level fertility is related to the distribution of income and
of access to education and social welfare
services (Flegg, 1979; Kocher, 1973; Repetto, 1979; Rich, 1973; Ridker, 1976).
That is, the relatively more equal the

56 Kocher

distribution of incomes, assets and social services, the larger will be the proportion of the population experiencing
those changes in intermediate fertility
variables which result in “excess supply” of children, a declining number desired, and eventually declining fertility.

Although considerable skepticism is
found in the literature (see for example,
Birdsall, 1977; Cassen, 1978; Simmons,
1979) and longitudinal data are probably not yet adequate for rigorous empirical testing, this proposition not only appears to be broadly consistent with the
experiences of several developing countries, it is also a logical correlate of almost any version of demographic transition theory which postulates fertility
decline as being an eventual consequence of rising incomes, educational
attainment, improved health, etc.
(Snodgrass, 1979). As Flegg (1979)
points out, however, a relatively more
equal distribution of income may result

 

Social Biology

in some increase in fertility in the short
run also predicted by the model shown
here in Figure 1) before contributing to
a more rapid reduction in aggregatelevel fertility in the long run.

Thus, the policy value of research
which better illuminates the complex
causal relationships flowing from the
larger biological/cultural/socioeconomic
setting through intermediate fertility
variables to actual fertility will in itself
be insufficient if it does not include or is
not supplemented by information on the
relative shares of the total population
which are in each relevant subgroup.
