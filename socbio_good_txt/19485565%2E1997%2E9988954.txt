Martin’s Treatment of the Human

Sex Ratio at Birth

Martin (1994a) described the demography of the Havasupai Indians of North
Western Arizona 1896-1988. Of special
interest were data relating sex ratio at
birth to birth order, time, and mortality. In
that paper he opined that “the behavioral
variable which appears to tie all these
factors to sex ratio at birth is coital frequency.” More recently he has modified
that view and suggested that cervical mucus is a powerful determinant of offspring
sex ratio (Martin, 1995).

Krackow (1995) has noted that any
speculation on the mechanisms underlying sex ratio variation must accommodate
the evidence relating offspring sex ratio
to parental hormone levels around the
time of conception (see James, 1996).
Krackow listed a large number of possible mechanisms (including those adumbrated by Martin).

The point of the present note is to indicate the limitations of Martin’s hypothesis. I suggest that though coital rate and
cervical mucus may play a part, other
variables play a more decisive role.

It may be acknowledged that I have
never tried to identify the mechanism(s)
underlying mammalian sex ratio variation, other than to assert that they must be
under hormonal control. They may include any combination of those listed by

 

 

Krackow (1995) or others so far unidentified.

Martin (1995) considers the relationship between coital rate, timing of insemination within the cycle and the sex ratio
of resultant offspring. He concurs with
the overall conclusion of Gray (1991)
who, in a meta-analysis of previous data,
suggested that the regression of sex ratio
(proportion male) on cycle day within the
cycle (vis-a-vis ovulation) is U-shaped.

Martin introduces the hypothesis that
this U-shaped regression is dependent on
the varying extents to which the cervical
mucus acts as a (hormonally controlled)
filter during the cycle and that Ex hypothesi, X-bearing sperm are more impeded,
the thicker the mucus. Since the mucus 1s
least viscous around the time of ovulation, the U-shaped regression is explained. Moreover, according to Martin,
the positive association between coital
rate and sex ratio is explained by the suggestion that Y-sperm are better able to
navigate through the detritus of dead
sperm caused by previous inseminations.
Both Martin’s suggestions need to be verified before his explanation can be accepted. I am not clear—except in one respect to be returned to later—that his
hypothesis represents an advance on my
hormonal hypothesis (James, 1996). First,

I shall deal with some data which his hypothesis seems unable to accommodate
and which are explicable on mine.

SEX RATIOS OF OFFSPRING OF
POLYGYNOUS MARRIAGES BY THE
DOMICILIARY ARRANGEMENTS
OF THE WIVES

The sex ratio of offspring of polygynous
marriages apparently depends on the domiciliary arrangements of the wives. If the
wives are housed separately, as in East
Africa (Whiting, 1993), then polygynous
women bear more daughters than sons. If
the wives live together in a harem as in West
Africa or in Mormon societies, they reportedly produce more sons than daughters
(Thomas, 1913, 1969; Mealey and Mackey,
1990). The association of domiciliary
arrangement with offspring sex ratio is also
featured by mouse lemurs (Perret, 1990).

I have noted that these latter data are
readily explicable on the hormonal hypothesis and provide the basis for a negative
feedback mechanism that would explain
the curious stabilizing movements in the
human sex ratio in large populations
(James, 1995). In commenting on
Thomas’s work, Martin (19945) sought to
discredit it. Martin wrote, “The sex ratio
among the children who had died increased
with the number of wives and increased the
most among first births, ranging from 60
per cent male deaths in cases where there
was but one wife to 100 per cent male
deaths where there were four wives” (Martin’s italics). Martin concludes, “Clearly
these male respondents’ memories of their
wives’ births were guided by cultural preferences” and “The significance of the
Thomas data is thus nil.”

I reproduce Thomas’s table (1913, p.
19) as Table 1. There are two points to
make abut Martin’s assertions:

 

Brief Reports 277

1. The sex ratio among the children who
died, contrary to Martin, did not increase
with number of wives.

2. One can make no estimate of whether the
sex ratio of first-born dead increases with
number of wives because as Thomas himself remarks (p. 24), “The data which I
have been considering so far were not collected in a form that enables the sex of the
first born to be discovered.”

In brief, neither of Martin’s assertions
bears scrutiny. Thomas’s account seems
painstaking (if pedestrian); it was taken
seriously by a distinguished reproductive
biologist (Parkes, 1926) and it had the
unusual distinction of being reprinted 56
years later by the Negro Universities
Press.

So until Thomas’s work is rebutted, I
suggest that it should be accepted provisionally at face value. A Mann-Whitney
test on the data in the two right-hand
columns of Thomas’s table (1913, p. 19)
(excluding the data on widows) yields a
z-score of 3.2 (p<0.001) suggesting that
the sex ratio at birth increases with the
number of wives.

Whiting (1993) suggested that polygynously married women have more control over their sexuality; and that women’s
libidos are strongest near the time of
ovulation (when conceptions are more
likely to lead to female conceptions) and
that this would accordingly account for a
low sex ratio in the offspring of polygynously married women. Borgerhoff Mulder
(1994) noted that this hypothesized effect
may be more likely to occur when cowives are not co-resident. However, in the
absence of empirical data, BorgerhoffMulder’s suggestion does not seem capable of plausibly reconciling Martin’s
hypothesis with Thomas’s data. However,
all these sets of polygynous sex ratios

mirror the Perret phenomenon which in
turn is explained by the hormonal hypothesis (James, 1995).

MAGNITUDE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COITAL RATE AND OFFSPRING
SEX RATIO

Martin (1995) suggested that the association between coital rate and offspring
sex ratio is substantial, which buttresses
the claim that one may validly infer coital
rates from sex ratios in relatively small
samples. I have suggested (James, 1994)
that the association between coital rate
and sex ratio, though positive, is small in
magnitude and insufficient to support
such an inference. My grounds were that
though mean coital rates in large Western
populations decline by about 50 per cent
across the first year of marriage (James,
1981, 1983) and by about 50 per cent

from age 20 to age 40 (Kinsey et al.,
1953), nevertheless the declines in sex ratio at birth in large populations corresponding to conceptions under these circumstances were very small (estimated at
1.7 per cent with respect to duration of
marriage and 0.5 per cent with respect to
maternal age).

Martin has made two responses to this
point. I shall deal with them separately:
(a) Martin (1995, p. 228) wrote that my
“claim is guaranteed by aggregating subpopulations which differ in their reproductive behaviors so that their differences
cancel each other.’ I think Martin is assuming what he needs to demonstrate,
that within these putative subpopulations
the reproductive behaviors do indeed differ. For what it is worth, the data from
individual recorded coital histories suggest no such heterogeneity. All of them
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 44, No. 3-4

recorded a monotonic decline in coital
rate with time across the first year of marriage. These calendar records were made
in England and the United States James,
1981). (6) My estimate of the decline in
sex ratio with the increase in maternal
age from 20 to 40 was based on data from
England and Wales 1938-68 (James,
1972). Martin (1994, p. 274) responded
with the comment “the English data thus
do not appear to be relevant on this matter” because “what is at issue here is the
frequency of coitus in the absence of
birth control.” It is true that contraception
was widespread in England and Wales
during the years 1938-68. However, it is
not clear that attempts at contraception
were widespread in the conception cycles
of the relevant births. Evidence is required on this point.

It is worth remarking that if Martin is
correct, it should be comparatively easy
for him to demonstrate it. If the association between coital rate and sex ratio is as
great as he implies, the sample size required to stand a reasonable chance of detecting it is not prohibitively great.

SEX RATIO AND BIRTH ORDER

Martin (1994a) reported a highly significant decline in sex ratio with birth order in his Havasupai data. He suggested
that this decline is explained by a decline
in coital rate with duration of marriage.
The variation of sex ratio with birth order
in large Western populations is minuscule
in contrast with that in the Havasupai
(James, 1987). But Martin (1995, p. 228)
points out that “examination of behaviorally uniform natural fertility populations reveals large variations in sex ratios
with birth order.’ This statement is correct, but not all of these populations show
a monotonic decline. Some (cited by

 

Brief Reports

279

Martin 1994a) show an increase, and the
data of Underwood (1995) from Guam
show a U-shaped regression of sex ratio

on birth order. Lastly, Martin’s (1994a)

own data show no such regression since
1970 (apparently obliterated by increasing numbers of illegitimate, disproportionately female, births to young women).

A number of anthropologists (Martin,
1994a; Whiting, 1993; Borgerhoff Mulder,
1994; Brewis, 1993; Underwood, 1995)
have invoked my hypothesis (James, 1971)
that variation in coital rate around the time
of conception is responsible for variation in
the sex ratio of the resultant births. It
would seem odd to me if varying patterns
of coital rate with duration of marriage
were responsible for the various forms of
regression of sex ratio on birth order mentioned above. I have never seen data suggesting anything but a monotonic decline
in coital rate with duration of marriage.
However, Underwood (1995) articulates a
view apparently espoused by Martin. She
writes: “the apparent anomaly [of the high
sex ratios in the late birth orders] is resolved, however, and James’s hypothesis of
human sex ratio determination is supported
when universalistic assumptions of declining coital frequencies with spousal age and
marital duration are replaced by more appropriate and population-specific ethnodemographic information.’ However, we are
not provided with precisely that information, that is, direct evidence of coital rates
by marriage duration in these societies.

In the absence of such desiderata, one
may speculate on what does cause the
substantial and significant variation in sex
ratio with birth order in these populations.
It is possible that mortality in or emigration from these populations have been
sex-related, which would cause fluctuations in the adult male:female ratio. This

280

factor, in turn, would be expected to cause
stabilizing effects on the sex ratio at birth
as described in James (1995).

In an ingenious argument, Martin
(1994a) showed that if (a) there is a maternal age effect in sex ratio, and (b) successive cohorts of women vary in size, then (c)
there will be secular variation in sex ratio.
One may note, however, that if there is secular variation in sex ratio (from some other
cause), then this factor will lead to an assoClation of sex ratio with birth order. If the
sex ratio were showing a secular decrease,
for instance, then later births would have
lower sex ratios than earlier births within
sibships. Thus, one might suggest that in
the Havasupai the variation of sex ratio
with birth order may be secondary to secular changes due to these stabilizing effects.

Such a suggestion has attractive features:

1. One would expect the secular movements in sex ratio (as a result of stabilizing processes) to be much more apparent in small populations than large ones
because all parents in a small society
would experience an imbalance in the
overall adult sex ratio as part of their
own environment. In contrast, in a large
society, the overall imbalance in adult
sex ratio is likely to be much smaller;
moreover, individuals ex hypothesi respond only to imbalances in their own
environment. Thus, in large societies the
imbalances (and the hypothesized responses in sex ratio at birth) could be in
different directions for different couples, which offers an explanation for the
finding that in large societies, the association between birth order and sex ratio
is both tiny and labile (James and Rostron, 1985).

2. As noted above, Martin (1994a) cited evidence for substantial variability across
small societies of the association between
sex ratio and birth order. Monotonic downward, monotonic upward, and U-shaped
regressions have all been reported. These

findings would all be explained by different secular movements of the adult male:
female ratio (dependent on migration and
mortality) in the different societies.

The point could be tested if the Havasupal population could be reconstructed
to indicate the ratio of living adult males
to adult females at the time of each live
birth conception. It would also be interesting to see data relating sex ratio to
birth order in other well-documented natural fertility populations, e.g., the Hutterites, the Amish, seventeenth-century
French villagers, and the more recent
rural Quebecois. In principle, my hypothesis could be tested on these data too.

PATERNAL INFLUENCE ON SEX RATIO

Several male occupations are associated with low offspring sex ratios, e.g.,
professional divers, professional drivers, —
DBCP-applicators, carbon setters (James,
1996), and workers in the vicinity of
high voltage installations (Mubarak and
Mubarak, 1996). Moreover, a number of
illnesses in men are associated with low
offspring sex ratios, e.g., non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma and multiple sclerosis (see
James, 1996, for references). The known
hormonal profile in these conditions (low
testosterone and/or high gonadotropin
levels) is hypothesized to be responsible
for these sex ratios. In contrast, Martin’s
hypothesis seems unable to deal with this
sex ratio variation.

VARIANCES OF THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF
THE COMBINATIONS OF THE SEXES IN
LITTERS OF POLYTOCOUS MAMMALS

These distributions are subbinomial in
a number of species (see James, 1996, for
references). One may suggest that this is
because p (the probability that a zygote is

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 44, No. 3-4

male) varies from zygote to zygote within
litters, and that this variation is due to
maternal hormone levels varying across
the interval during which the zygotes are
being formed. I know of no plausible alternative explanation, and Martin’s hypothesis does not suggest one.

DISCUSSION

Thus far I have tried to indicate some
limitations of Martin’s theorizing. However, his hypothesis may turn out to be (at
least partially) true. The notion of sperm
competition in human beings (from
which his hypothesizing is derived) is admittedly largely speculative. But it is
plausible, and there is one set of sex ratio

281

data which seems resistant to hormonal
explanation.

According to Guerrero’s (1974) data,
the sex ratio of births following artificial
insemination rises monotonically with
cycle day of insemination. I can see no
way of reconciling this finding with my
hypothesis. If others cannot supply this
lacuna (and if the finding should be confirmed), one may wonder whether differences between the physical properties
(speed and/or duration of viability and/or
ability to navigate past debris) of the Xand Y-bearing sperm also play a part in
determining which sperm fertilizes the
ovum.
