Incidence of Childlessness for

United States Women, Cohorts Born

1891-1945

Demography, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphic, Pennsylvania

Despite the fact that numerous researchers (Whelpton and Kiser, 1950;
Grabill, et al., 1958; Freedman et al., 1959;
Grabill and Glick, 1959; Mitra, 1966;
Whelpton et al., 1966; Bogue, 1969; Gustavus and Henley, 1971; and Veevers,
1971a, 6, c) have provided estimates on
the extent of childlessness for different subgroups of American women using period
data, no one has made use of available
data to derive cohort-specific estimates of
childlessness or cohort-specific age-specific
estimates of childlessness in order to examine the incidence of childlessness historically.

Such an omission is curious in that by
following Ryder’s technique for analyzing
trends in fertility across cohorts and modifying his technique through the computation of zero parities for cohorts by individual years as well as updating his data
series, cohort estimates of childlessness can
be obtained (Ryder, 1970). This paper
follows this strategy and addresses three
questions: (1) What changes have occurred over time across cohorts in the levels
of childlessness among women who have
reached age fifty? (2) What shifts have
transpired over time in cohort-specific age
specific levels of childlessness? (3) What
comparison can be made between measures
of childlessness as reported from period
data and the estimates of childlessness derived herein from cohort data?

MATERIALS AND METHODS

To examine the incidence of childlessness of ever-married women in the birth
cohorts 1891-1945, data were derived using the techniques employed by Ryder
(1970, pp. 99-101 and 118-120), with
some modifications. Ryder generated two
sets of data: age-specific parity-specific
birth rates and age-specific first marriage
rates for successive birth cohorts of United
States women, 1891-1945. He used available birth rate data on fertility experience
for the calendar years 1917-64 as reported
in Whelpton and Campbell (1960) and in
Vital Statistics of the United States (US.
National Vital Statistics Division, 195864). These sources provided age-specific
parity-specific birth rates for birth cohorts
1903-17, ages 14-49 inclusive. Since
Ryder’s initial paper, age-specific parityspecific birth rates have been reported for
the calendar years 1965-68 (U.S. National
Vital Statistics Division) and are incor

porated herein. These data provide complete coverage on fertility experiences of
women in the birth cohorts 1903~20.

For cohorts prior to 1903, Ryder estimated age-specific parity-specific birth
rates for those selected ages in which data
were incomplete. He assumed that the
average proportions at each parity and at
each age observed for the cohorts 190307 would be applicable to earlier cohorts
for which data were missing. With the use
of these proportionate distributions by
parity at each age, he distributed cumulative birth rates (U.S. National Vital Statistics Divsion, 1960) by age and order by
order for cohorts 1891-1902.

We differ slightly from Ryder in estimating age-specific parity-specific birth
rates at selected ages with missing data for
the birth cohorts 1921-45. We assumed
that each age-specific parity-specific birth
rate would decline decrementally from its
1968 value until 1978, then remain constant. For each age in which data were
missing after 1968, the proportional change
in the age-specific parity-specific birth
rates from 1963 to 1968 was calculated,
then converted to an annual proportional
change. For each of the successive years
1969-78, the annual proportional change
was decremented by 0.1. Estimated agespecific parity-specific birth rates as of
1978, were projected as constants for ages
with missing data until the 1945 birth cohort of women reached 49 years of age.

To generate age-specific marriage rates,
we also followed Ryder, again with modification.! This strategy yielded a set of
data on number of women ever married, by
age at first marriage for birth cohorts

1¥For a discussion of how Ryder’s technique
was applied and the data series on age at first
marriage and ever-married women updated, as
well as an analysis of the incidence of marriage
in cohorts born 1891 to 1945, see Hastings and
Robinson, 1973.

Incidence of Childlessness

179

1891-1945 in single years expressed both
as rates and percentages.

With these two data sets, the procedure
for estimating age-specific proportions of
childlessness for ever-married women by
cohort was relatively simple. Cumulative
age-specific birth rates for parity one of
each cohort were obtained. Since these
rates include the fertility experiences of
both unmarried and married women, they
were adjusted to exclude the unmarried by
linking cumulative age-specific marriage
with the cumulative age-specific birth
rates. This adjustment was obtained by
dividing the cumulative age-specific marriage rate into the cumulative age-specific
birth rate, yielding the number of evermarried women per one thousand with one
child or more. Since this figure is expressed
to the base one thousand, the difference between number of ever-married women with
children per thousand and one thousand
yields the number of ever-married women
who are childless at that age. Conversion
of this rate to a percentage is straightforward. Estimates of age-specific proportions
of childlessness for all women by cohort
were also estimated. The cumulative agespecific birth rate for parity one was subtracted from the one thosand and converted into a percentage.

Limitations of the data—We suspect
that percentages on childlessness for ever~
married women and all women in the birth
cohorts 1891-1895 derived by these procedures underestimate actual childlessness
of these cohorts. This underestimation is
an artifact of the retrojection procedure
used in estimation age-specific parity-specific birth rates for cohorts 1891-1902 for
selected ages with missing data. We suspect that by distributing cumulative birth
rates by age and order using average proportions of age-specific parity-specific birth
rates of 1903-1907, the actual fertility exDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

periences of those younger ages with missing data may be overestimated.

Similarly, the figures on childlessness for
the cohorts 1941-45 should be treated with
caution as they are heavily dependent on
data derived from projected estimates. Despite these limitations, these data permit
an examination of the incidence of childlessness historically.

by dividing the TFR by “ the proportion
of women married (at least once) by exact
age 50, again under mortality-free conditions” (p. 101). These data substantiate
the long-held assumption that the per cent
of ever-married women who remain childless is increasingly rare. It should be noted,
however, that if fertility continues to decline for women born in cohorts after 1945,
then we can reasonably expect increases in
the percentages of women who remain
childless by the end of their fecund period.

Within each cohort among all women,
age-specific proportions on childlessness
decrease as age increases (Table 2). This

¢ Norman B. Ryder (1970, pp. 101-102 and Table 6, p. 109). According to Ryder, “‘the total fertility rate is the sum of
all ages of the birth rates for all orders. It may be interpreted as the mean number of births per woman if the cohort

were mortality-free’ (p. 101), The mean marital

parity is obtained by dividing the total fertility rate by the propor
tion of women married at least once by exact age 50, under mortality-free conditions, and may be interpreted as the

mean number of births per ever-married women.

reveals that the level of childlessness
among all women and ever-married women
at age fifty has been inversely related to
total fertility rates and mean marital parity
across cohorts. According to Ryder (1970,
p. 101), “The total fertility rate (TFR)
is the sum of all ages of the birth rates for
all orders. It may be interpreted as the
mean number of births per woman if the
cohort were mortality-free.” Similarly, the
mean marital parity (MMP) is obtained

pattern of decreasing childlessness across
age moves less rapidly within cohorts displaying low fertility and moves more rapidly among cohorts characterized by high
fertility. This pattern is most pronounced
when one compares the age-specific proportions of childlessness of the 1907-11
cohorts with the cohorts 1933-37. Across
cohorts within each age group, age-specific
proportions on childlessness tend to vary
inversely with cohort total fertility rates.

This relationship is most noticeable in
those age groups 30-34 and older.

Within each cohort for ever-married
women, age-specific proportions on childlessness in general are highest among 1519 year olds, decline to lows among ages
30-39, and thereafter increase slightly
through ages 40-49. It is of note that the
lowest age-specific proportions on childlessness are observed for women who
reached those ages typically defined as
having a high probability of completed fertility although still in their fecund years.

A glance at Table 3 also reveals that the
lowest age-specific proportions of childlessness change from cohort to cohort. Women
born in those cohorts of 1905 and before
showed the lowest age-specific proportions
childless for ages 30-34. Women born be
tween 1907 and 1936 had the lowest agespecific proportions childless in the ages
35-39. Women born in the cohorts between
1937 and 1945 showed the lowest age-specific proportions childless for ages 30-34,
paralleling the experiences of women born
in the cohorts 1905 and before. These
shifts in the lows for cohort-specific agespecific proportions of childlessness parallel
in reverse the rise and decline in the tempo
of fertility as discussed by Ryder (1970)
and Campbell (1973).

Of particular interest are the low percentages childless observed for the birth
cohorts 1931-39, ages 30-34 and 35~39,
These percentages are lower than those
usually estimated as minimum levels for
childlessness reported in other studies.
However, we suspect that our estimates

fairly accurately depict the overall pattern
of childlessness historically, since women
born in these cohorts were in their early
childbearing years, ages 15-24, during
roughly the height of the “baby boom.”
Therefore, these women would be expected
to exhibit low percentages of childlessness.
Further, these lower estimates also are partially accounted for by the fact that most
other estimates are based on period data.
Period estimates of childlessness tend to
be inflated, since they overrepresent women
still in their early childbearing years and
at risk of conception. Cohort estimates
tend to be less sensitive to differences in
the age composition of women currently at
risk of conception.

Estimates of childlessness reported in
the literature usually have been derived
from period data. With the use of cohort-specific age-specific estimates of proportions childless, a set of figures was
constructed in Table 4 to approximate
period-based estimates as presented by
Grabill and Glick (1959). Three significant relationships are noted.

First, the period estimates on proportions childless in every age group are
higher than the corresponding cohort-based
estimates. The discrepancy between these
two sets of data generally is greater among
the younger ages and smaller among the
older ages. This discrepancy is attributable
in part to the differences in modes of data

Source: The period data listed under the ‘‘census’’ columns come from Grabill and Glick (1959, Table 2, p. 64). The
cohort percentages on childlessness of this table are based on a cross-sectional grouping of cohort data to attain comparability with census data (period) on childlessness, j.e., ages 15~19 represent cohort 1921-25. The cohort percentage ages

15-19 is the average of

age 18 born in 1924, and age 19 born in 1925.

analysis, i.e., period and cohort, and in
part to sampling variability.”

Second, the magnitude of the differences
between cohort and period estimates has
been diminishing over time (i.e., the differences in the 1957 age-specific proportions
of childlessness are smaller than those
presented for 1940 in all but two cases).
This convergence over time is even more
marked in the comparisons for ever-married women. This phenomenon indirectly
reflects the trend toward earlier childbearing after marriage and completing childbearing at earlier ages among the more
recent cohorts than was the case for later
cohorts.

Third, despite the differences in levels
of childlessness based on period and cohort
data, and the discrepancies in these estimates among age groups, both sets of estimates tend to parallel each other and thus

ercentage childless for women age 15 born in 1921, age 16 born in 1922, age 17 born in 1923,

depict historically the changing incidence
of childlessness among United States’
women.

DISCUSSION

This paper examined the incidence of
childlessness among all women and-ever
married women, cohorts born 1891-1945,
using cohort-specific age-specific estimates.
These data have the advantage over period
data that they provide a more detailed picture of shifts in patterns of childlessness
as well as the incidence of fertility. Research should be undertaken to update this
data series substituting vital statistics as
they become available for our projected
estimates. Generation of cohort-specific
age-specific estimates historically for different nations would prove useful for assessing the shifts in the incidence of childlessness cross-nationally, Finally, research
might focus on selected social, economic
and biologic cohort-specific differentials in
incidence of childlessness.
