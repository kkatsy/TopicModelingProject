ABSTRACT: This paper examines the extent to which the traditional practice of sexual
abstinence during lactation has broken down among Yoruba women residents in urban areas.
The first major finding is that there is a gradual erosion of the tradition, and the dominant
factors of modernization are education of the woman and the use of contraception. The second
major finding is that the breakdown of postpartum sexual taboos has statistically significant
negative consequences on duration of lactation, although the negative impact of woman’s
education is greater. The third major finding is that duration of breastfeeding reduces birth
interval significantly only when it is less than 15 months, and that both durations of
breastfeeding and birth intervals have declined over time. The first two findings suggest further
reductions in the proportion of women who abstain from sexual relations during lactation and
in durations of breastfeeding as more women become more educated. Significant declines in

birth intervals may follow soon after.

A common feature in all societies is
that women abstain from sexual relations immediately after childbirth, even
in the absence of lactation. The physiological condition of women immediately
after parturition calls for a period of sexual abstinence. However, abstinence
from sexual relations which derives
from cultural beliefs is not a common
phenomenon in all societies, but is limited to societies where sexual relations
during lactation are thought to have detrimental effects on the health of the lactating child. The Yoruba society of Nigeria is one of the usually cited societies
where such traditional beliefs have been
held for a long period of time (Schoenmaeckers et al., 1981; Caldwell and
Caldwell, 1981; Orubuloye, 1981, 1987;
Adeokun, 1987). Some of these studies
noted that sexual abstinence was traditionally achieved through means that include physical separation between the

nursing mother and her husband (Orubuloye, 1981, Caldwell and Caldwell,
1977; Adeokun, 1987).

Changes have taken place in many
traditional values and practices in the
course of modernization, and it is unlikely that the culturally rooted abstinence from sexual relations during lactation will be an exception. In fact, some
studies have suggested the onset of a
break from the traditional practice
(Caldwell and Caldwell, 1981; Orubuloye, 1987). This paper, therefore, examines the present level of departure
from the traditional practice of sexual
abstinence during lactation as well as the
factors that facilitate the break from the
traditional norms. The impact of the
break from the traditional postpartum
sexual norms on duration of lactation
will also be examined by determining
whether durations of lactation differ
significantly between women who expe

rience sexual relations during lactation
and those who abstain from sexual relations throughout the lactation period. It
shall also be determined whether duration of lactation has any significant impact on childspacing.

Although the impact of breastfeeding
in reducing fertility and child mortality
is widely known (see for instance
Simpson-Hebert and Huffman, 1981),
, the primary purpose of breastfeeding in

= all societies is child nourishment (Nag,
a 1983). The significance of breast milk as
2 an important component of infant and
9 child nutrition may be greater, however,
A in many poor less developed countries
<¢ that lack adequate food substitutes. The
protein-deficient staples of many less
0 = developed countries are often inadequate to serve as appropriate substitutes
= for breast milk (Whiting, 1964; OrubuSoloye, 1987). In addition, traditional
5 weaning foods are usually not in an ap= propriate form for infants, and breastS milk substitutes are too expensive where
“= and when available and are often mixed
© with dirty water. Mothers in many Afri‘= can countries usually appreciate the nu—tritional value of breast milk for the
-© growth of their children, and this appre3 ciation underlies the usually long period
S of lactation.
§ As in other African societies, breast
© milk is perceived to be pure and good
for the growth of the child by the
Yoruba people. The desire to feed the
child with uncontaminated breast milk
has given rise to the taboo against sexual
relations during lactation. The principal
belief underlying the sex taboo is that
the mother’s milk can be poisoned by semen if sexual relations take place during
lactation. Such “poisoned milk’’ is
thought to endanger the health of the
nursing child (Orubuloye, 1981, 1987;
Schoenmackers et al., 1981; Caldwell

Yoruba Women

111

and Caldwell, 1981; Adeokun, 1987).
Duration of lactation of about 2.5 years
was common in the traditional Yoruba
society (Talbot, 1926).

Studies among the Yoruba have usually noted a high degree of adherence to
the cultural taboos against sexual relations during lactation with the consequence that the period of sexual abstinence is generally equal to or longer
than the duration of breastfeeding
(Schoenmackers et al., 1981; Whiting,
1964; Saucier, 1972; Matthews, 1955;
Caldwell and Caldwell, 1977, 1$81). It is
only among a small proportion of the
population that the mean durations of
lactation and postpartum sexual abstinence are equal. Duration of postnatal
abstinence of about three years has been
recorded for the traditional Yoruba society (Talbot, 1926).

As noted earlier, there have been recent indications of a significant departure from the traditional practice of
postpartum sexual abstinence, especially in the urban areas. On the basis of
the results of their studies among the
Yoruba, Caldwell and Caldwell (1981,
pp. 181-182) suggested three stages in
the reduction of postpartum sexual abstinence. The Caldwells’ findings together with those of Orubuloye (1981)
suggest that a breakdown of the postpartum sexual abstinence taboos can be expected as greater proportions of the
population become more educated and
more people live away from the traditional family settings where deviations
from the norms are condemned.

August 1987 and August 1988 in nine
Nigerian cities. The cities are:
Abeokuta, Akure, and Ibadan (SouthWest); Enugu, Owerri, and PortHarcourt (South-East); Jos, Kano, and
Zaria (North). [tis the first national survey on indices of women’s status and fertility covering all the major ethnic
groups in Nigeria, and 10,340 evermarried women between the ages of 15
and 49 years in selected households
were interviewed.

Information was collected through
formal interviewing. The interview
schedule contained questions on: women’s perceptions of their roles within
marriage, premarital sexual relations,
premarital and postmarital use of contraception, pregnancies and their outcomes, desired and achieved family size,
childrearing practices, sexual relations
during lactation, duration of lactation,
birth interval, age and forms of marriage, religion, ethnic group, education
before and after marriage, employment
history and some other socioeconomic
characteristics of the woman, of her husband, and of her parents. In addition,
two sections of the interview schedule
were devoted to collecting information
on the characteristics of members of the
household and on births and deaths in
the household in the twelve months preceding the survey.

Internal consistency checks and other
methods of evaluating the consistency of
demographic data suggest that the data
are generally of good quality.! In addition, results from the survey were compared with those from the 1981/82 Nigerian Fertility Survey. The results from
this survey are consistent with those
from the Nigerian Fertility Survey.

1For more details on sample selection and
means of ensuring good quality data, see Feyisetan
and Pebley (1989).

Social Biology

There were, unfortunately no questions
on sexual relations during lactation in
the Nigerian Fertility Survey.

The analysis presented in this paper is
based on data on Yoruba women with at
least two, and at most seven, births all of
which are living at the time of the survey. A minimum of two births ts needed
to guarantee a closed interval during
which a child was weaned. The choice of
a maximum of seven births is necessitated by the fact that because only an insignificant proportion of the population
had more than seven births, the questionnaire coding format was designed to
accommodate information on the duration of breastfeeding of each child and
the interval between successive births
up to a maximum of seven births. The
requirement of a minimum of two births
implies that a woman whose duration of
marriage is less than five years can be selected only if she has short birth intervals. A selection bias is thus introduced
into the analysis of birth intervals if such
women are included. This group of
women has therefore been excluded.

The restriction to women with all
births surviving at the time of the survey
is necessitated by limitations of the data
and the desire to include respondents
with fairly accurate data on both the duration of lactation and birth interval.
The birth interval in which a child died
was not recorded. In addition, durations
of lactation were not reported for many
dead children. Where they were reported, it could not be determined if
those durations coincided with ages at
death which were also not reported for
many dead children. Women with all
births surviving are no doubt a very select group of people. Yoruba women,
usually with limited child survival strategies, adopt long birth intervals to ensure
the survival of their children. Women

with all births surviving may, therefore,
be those with more and better childcare
alternatives.?

Although there is adequate information on durations of breastfeeding for
each child, and the interval between successive births, up to a maximum of
seven births, the results presented in this
paper pertain to the last closed interval.
Data on duration of breastfeeding for

wthe open interval are inadequate since
Swomen were not asked whether they
were still breastfeeding at the time of the
"survey. Preliminary analyses show that
average durations of breastfeeding and
Abirth intervals show little variation by
Sbirths. Consequently different analyses
“for individual births give results that are
‘similar to the ones presented here. Data
from closed intervals (particularly from
‘gthe last closed interval) tend to underestimate average durations per woman,
.2particularly for younger women (Les= thaeghe et al., 1981). In order to reduce
¢ the bias, this analysis has been restricted
Z to women aged 20 years and above who
Shave been married for five or more
Eyears.
[. itis noted that the data on durations
“of breastfeeding show some heaping at
multiples of three months. Preliminary
examinations, including the use of the
Fapproach described in Lesthaeghe and
APage (1980), however, show that the
amount of heaping does not render in
*Several cases were excluded from this analysis
because of the restrictions. There are 3,754
Yoruba women with adequate information on all
the variables examined in this paper. Of this number, 3,134 had between 2 and 7 livebirths, 530 had
either 1 or no livebirth, and 90 had more than
seven livebirths. Of the 3,134 women with 2 to 7
livebirths, 2,665 had all their children surviving at
the time of the survey, and of the latter, 2,340 had
been married for five or more years. The analysis
in this paper is therefore based on data on 2,340
women. This represents about 75 per cent of all
women with 2 or more livebirths.

adequate the use of arithmetic means
for this analysis. In addition, the
changes over time and the differences
between groups of women are not concealed by the heaping. The data on birth
interval also show some heaping on multiples of six months.

METHODS OF ANALYSIS

The principal methods of analysis are
the logistic and the dummy variable regression procedures. The logistic regression procedure was used to examine the
influence of several variables on a dichotomous dependent variable:
whether or not a woman usually has sexual relations during lactation. The coefficients of the logistic regression procedure were later converted into
probabilities, and these are denoted as
adjusted proportions in Table 2. The
dummy variable regression procedure
was used to examine the influence of
some binary independent variables on
each of two interval-level dependent
variables: average duration of lactation
and mean birth interval both of which
are measured in months. Some of the independent variables measured by intervals were transformed into binary variables because earlier investigations
showed a nonlinear relationship between them and the dependent variables. The coefficients of the dummy regression analyses were also transformed
into actual means; these means are denoted as adjusted durations and intervals in Tables 6 and 8 respectively.*

The independent variables are: education of woman before marriage, the
use of contraception, working status,
place of birth, religion, duration of marriage, most of which were found to be

variable regressions are available on request.

significantly associated with the dependent variables at the zero-order level.
Education, defined as the highest level
attained, is coded into four categories:
no formal education; primary/modern;
secondary; and post-secondary. The noformal-education category includes a
few women who started but did not
complete the primary education program. The primary/modern category
consists of two groups of women:
women who only completed the primary
education program and those who in addition to the primary education program
also completed a three-year postprimary educational program designated as “‘modern school” in the southwestern part of Nigeria. The modern
school curriculum is much closer to that
of the primary school than to that of the
secondary school; hence women with
modern-schoo] education have been
merged with those with primary-school
education. In addition to similarity in
curriculum, the two groups of women
exhibit similar patterns of behavior. The
secondary category includes some
women who completed a program for
primary school teachers. The postsecondary category consists of all degree
and nondegree programs after the secondary education.

Use of contraception has four categories: use of efficient methods only; use of
inefficient methods only; use of both efficient and inefficient methods; nonuse
of any method. A woman is classified as
a user of an efficient method if she uses
the pill, injection, I.U.D., diaphragm,
sponge or foam tablets, and jelly alone.
A user of an inefficient method is a
woman who uses a douche, abstinence,
and rhythm alone. A woman is classified
as a user of both methods if she claims to
have used any efficient method together
with any inefficient method. The non
Social Biology

user category includes very few women
who responded “inapplicable” to our
question on use of contraceptive methods. With respect to working status, a
woman is classified as working in the formal sector if she is either an employer or
an employee ofa private or public enterprise. She is a worker in the informal
sector if she is either an own account
worker, an unpaid family worker, or a
farm worker. The Protestant/other
Christian category of religion consists of
Protestants and other non-Catholic
Christian denominations.

RESULTS

The respondents were asked the
question: ‘Do you usually have sexual
relations during lactation?” Tables 1
and 2 show proportions of women who
responded “‘yes”’ to the question.

Before relating sexual behavior during lactation to socioeconomic characteristics, we attempted first to determine
whether there has been a change in adherence to the traditional postpartum
sex taboos in the twenty years preceding
the survey. An examination of trend is
limited to the twenty years preceding
the survey for lack of adequate data to
go beyond that period. To examine the
trend, women were first distributed according to the time the intervals following their first births were closed. Four
time periods were identified before the
survey: 0-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14
years and 15-19 years. The proportions
having sexual relations during lactation
were then computed. These proportions
are presented in Table 1 according to education of the women. The table shows
that the proportions having sexual relations during lactation have increased in
the twenty years preceding the survey.
The increase is, however, very minimal

Having determined that there has
been a decline in the proportions of

identify the factors that facilitate the
break from the traditional norms. The
unadjusted and adjusted proportions
having sexual relations during lactation
are presented, according to several

characteristics, in Table 2. The adjusted
proportions were derived from estimates of a logit regression equation in
which other characteristics were held
constant.

The unadjusted (or crude) proportions indicate that women below age 40,
women with fewer than 15 years of marriage, women with secondary and postsecondary education, women who work

in the formal sector, Christian women,
and users of efficient contraception are
more likely to experience sexual relations during lactation than their respective counterparts. Because the bivariate
relationships may merely reflect the
compositional effects of other variables,
adjusted proportions were calculated.

The adjusted proportions indicate
that education (particularly after the
primary school level), the use of modern
contraception and, to a lesser extent,
duration of marriage and husband’s education, are the only significant factors
influencing the likelihood of experiencing sexual relations during lactation.
Each of the other characteristics becomes insignificant once other characteristics are controlled.

The decision to examine the impact
of husband’s characteristics on the likelihood that the spouse would experience
sexual relations during lactation was
motivated by the realization that a
woman can break a traditional postpartum sex taboo only if her husband was
similarly disposed. Of the three characteristics of the husbands examined (age,
education, and religion), only education
(and only at the post-secondary level)
has an independent impact on the likelihood that the spouse would experience
sexual relations during lactation. Husband’s religion has not been included in
the regression equation because of its
high correlation with the wife’s religion.

DURATION OF LACTATION AND
SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS

In order to determine the trend, we
investigated changes in durations of lactation in the twenty years preceding the
survey. As with proportions having sexual relations during lactation, the investigation of changes would also not be
carried out beyond the twenty-year pe

riod. Women were first distributed according to the time the intervals following their first births were closed. The
procedure was repeated for the second,
third, fourth, and fifth births depending
on each woman’s parity. Again, four
time periods were identified before the
survey: 0-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14
years, and 15~19 years. Mean durations
of lactation were then computed from
reported durations of lactation for each
child. The results are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Durations of lactation are
also presented in Table 3 according to
sexual experience during lactation and
in Table 4 according to women’s education.

The two tables indicate that durations of lactation have declined in the
twenty years preceding the survey. For
instance, while first births who were
weaned between 15 and 19 years before
the survey were breastfed for about 12
months, those who were weaned within
the four years preceding the survey were
breastfed for about 10 months. The
same pattern is true for the second,
third, and the fifth births. In addition to
the general pattern, Table 3 also shows
that women who usually experience sexual relations during lactation have always had shorter durations of breastfeeding than those who usually abstain
from sexual relations throughout the entire period of lactation. The two groups
of women, however, experience declines in durations of lactation over
time. Table 4 also shows that durations
of lactation have always been shorter
among women with higher education.

In order to determine whether sexual
relations before weaning have an independent influence on duration of lactation, we examined variations in durations of lactation in the last closed
interval according to sexual behavior

during lactation and several other characteristics of the women. Two features
are discernible from the unadjusted durations presented in Table 5. First, as
observed in Table 3, durations of lactation are generally longer for women
who abstain from sexual relations during the entire period of lactation; this
observation is true at every level of the
variables under consideration. Secondly, within each group and for the two
groups combined, duration of lactation
varies according to levels of each variable.

The adjusted durations in Panel 1 of
Table 6 also indicate a shorter duration
of lactation among women who resume
sexual relations before the Jactating
child is weaned. Their average duration
of lactation is 1.4 months shorter than
that for women who abstain from sexual
relations during the entire period of Iactation. Adjustment for other factors
has, however, reduced the impact of
sexual relations during lactation by almost half.

In examining the impact of resuming
sexual relations during lactation on duration of breastfeeding, we controlled
some variables that are found to influence either the likelihood of experiencing sexual relations before a child is
weaned or duration of lactation. The
controlled variables are shown in Panels
2 to 8 of Table 6. Since discussion of the
impact of these variables on duration of
lactation is not of primary concern in
this paper, only a brief description of salient findings is undertaken.

The controlled variables have varying degrees of impact on duration of lactation. The figures in Panel 3 suggest a
more general acceptance of shorter durations of Jactation as anorm rather than
an exception by younger marriage cohorts. Mothers with fewer than 15 years

Feyisetan

Social Biology

of marriage have shorter durations of
lactation than their counterparts with 20
or more years of marriage. Education
has a significant negative impact in spite
of the fact that variables through which

‘it can be hypothesized to influence dura
tion of lactation (for example, working
status of mothers and use of contraception) are included in the equation (Panel
4),

Women who have used only efficient
methods of contraception and those
who have used both efficient and inefficient methods have considerably
shorter durations of lactation than those
who have never used any method of
contraception (Panel 5). Unlike working mothers in the informal sector who
can take their children to their place of
Nor and breastfeed them there (if place

LM work i is separated from the home),
1h structure of formal sector activities
Kul
makes it impossible for mothers who
work in that sector to do the same. The
shorter duration of lactation among
mothers who work in the formal sector
(Panel 6) may, therefore, reflect the incompatibility between long intensive
breastfeeding and working in the formal
sector. Level of traditionality and, by
implication, adherence to traditional

. values is captured in part by religion.

Mothers of Islamic faith are found to adhere more to the traditional practice of
long duration of lactation (Panel 7).

CHILD SPACING AND SOCIOECONOMIC
FACTORS

Preliminary examinations also show
that birth intervals have declined moderately in the twenty years preceding the
survey. Women who resume sexual relations before weaning are also found to
have shorter birth intervals during each
of the four time periods identified. Attempts were, therefore, made to deter

mine if resumption of sexual relations
and durations of breastfeeding during
lactation have significant impact on
birth interval.

Unadjusted mean birth intervals (last
closed intervals) are presented in Table
7 according to whether or not mothers
had sexual relations during lactation, by
durations of breastfeeding and by other
socioeconomic characteristics. It is observed that: (1) average birth interval is
generally longer among women who abstain from sexual relations during lactation; and (2) within each group and for
all women, variations in birth intervals
across levels of education, use of contraception, working status, religion, and
migrant status appear very minimal,
while for other variables, the variations
appear substantial.

Adjusted figures in Table 8 indicate
that only two variables have statistically
significant “net” impact on birth interval. These variables are duration of
breastfeeding and duration of marriage.
Birth interval differentials in actual
months by levels of these variables are,
however, not substantial. The statistically insignificant “net” influence of experiencing sexual relations during lactation on the length of interval between
successive births is expected. Its impact
on birth interval is expected to decline
once duration of lactation through
which it is expected to influence birth interval is controlled.

Figures in Panel 2 of Table 8 show
significant birth interval differentials
only between women who breastfeed
for any duration less than 15 months and
those who breastfeed for 15 or more
months. For all durations of breastfeeding less than 15 months, there are no
significant birth interval differentials.
Also, women who have been married
for less than 15 years have significantly

 

Yoruba Women

123

shorter mean birth intervals than
women who have been married for 20 or
more years. In addition to indicating declines in birth intervals over time,
shorter birth intervals among women
who have been married for less than 15
years may reflect the fact that they are
more fecund than those whose marriages have lasted for 20 or more years
and hence are more likely to be pregnant sooner after a birth.

Education of the women and the use
of contraception have no significant
“net” impact on birth interval. Their impact was found to be minimal even before other variables were controlled. It
is possible that there is a normative minimum birth interval which women in the
society, irrespective of education or
contraceptive adoption, aim at attaining.

DISCUSSION

In this paper, the extent to which the
traditional practice of sexual abstinence
during lactation has broken down
among Yoruba women resident in the
urban areas was examined. In addition,
the consequences of the break in the traditional postpartum sexual abstinence
norms on duration of lactation as well as
those of changes in duration of lactation
on birth interval were also examined.
Three major findings are particularly
noteworthy.

The first major finding is that there is
a gradual erosion of the traditional
norms surrounding sexual relations during breastfeeding and that education of
the woman and the use of contraception
are the dominant factors of modernization that have facilitated the departure
from the traditional practice. Education, especially at secondary and tertiary
levels, has often been seen as a measure

of Westernization (see for instance, Lesthaeghe et al., 1981). Apart from widening women’s horizon, education facilitates the development of more rational
views about situations or phenomena.
The results, therefore, confirm the expectation that more educated women,
who are more likely to realize that the
belief system underlying the postpartum
sexual taboos has no rational base, will
be less likely to adhere to traditional
postpartum sex taboos.

The significant relationship between
the use of efficient contraception and
the likelihood of experiencing sexual relations during lactation can be explained
in two ways. On the one hand, it may be
that women who resume sexual relations during lactation are more likely to
use contraception to avoid becoming
pregnant too early after a birth. On the
other hand, it may be that women who
normally use contraception between
births are more disposed to early resumption of sexual relations since they
fee] that they are less likely to become
pregnant from such sexual acts.

The second major finding is that the
breakdown of the postpartum sexual taboos has statistically significant negative
consequences on duration of lactation.
However, the negative impact of education (one of the major determinants of
the breakdown of the traditional sex taboo) is greater. Three explanations can
be proffered for the shorter duration of
lactation observed among women who
resume sexual relations during lactation. First, it is possible that women who
experience sexual relations during lactation are also the ones who prefer not to
breastfeed for long durations. Second, it
may be that these women still believe
partially that sexual relations during lactation is harmful to the child, and thus
breastfeeding is terminated soon after

Yoruba Women

125

the resumption of sexual relations to
avert the perceived negative conseguences, Third, early pregnancies
among some mothers who experience
sexual relations during lactation may
force them to terminate lactation. The
fear of becoming pregnant again and
consequently of cutting off milk supply
to the child is probably one of the reasons why noncontracepting women abstain for a longer period than contracepting women.

The strong net negative impact of education on duration of lactation can only
be attributed to factors not yet controlled for. One such factor is a wider
use of powdered milk as a substitute for
breast milk by more educated women.
Another factor is that more educated
mothers may not see the need for a prolonged duration of breastfeeding.

The third major finding is that duration of breastfeeding reduces birth interval significantly only when it is less than
15 months and that both durations of
breastfeeding and birth intervals have
declined over time.

The first two major findings suggest
further reductions in the proportions of
women who abstain from sexual relations during lactation and in durations of
breastfeeding as more women become
more educated and possess the attitudinal and socioeconomic attributes associated with higher levels of education.
Significant declines in birth intervals
may follow soon after.

A collapse of the postpartum sex taboo is not an important policy issue in itself. It is the impact of the collapse on
duration of breastfeeding in a society
where costs of substitutes for breast milk
are beyond the reach of many families
that is of policy relevance. Until adequate substitutes are available, are obtainable at affordable prices, and are

126

prepared under hygienic conditions,
breast milk remains the safest and most
nutritious food for infants in less developed countries. Infants, therefore, need
to be breastfed for a reasonable duration of time to derive maximum
benefits.

Once socioeconomic attributes have
been controlled, shorter durations of
breastfeeding among women who have
sexual relations during lactation can
only be caused by attitudinal factors that
can more easily be manipulated. It appears that while education has facilitated an erosion of the traditional postpartum sexual abstinence taboos, it has
not totally detached women from the
traditional beliefs that sexual relations
during lactation have negative consequences, through poisoning of the
breast milk, on the health of the Jactating child. Thus, breastfeeding is usually
terminated shortly after the resumption
of sexual relations. Since departure
from the traditional sexual abstinence
pattern seems inevitable, there is need
for more public education to correct the
erroneous ideas that breast milk is poisoned by semen. Durations of lactation
are already declining under the influence of modernization factors at a
time when adequate substitutes are either not available or are too expensive
where available. There is no need to allow attitudinal factors that can be
avoided to increase the rate of decline.

Declines in duration of breastfeeding
may eventually lead to a shortening of
birth intervals especially through declines in duration of amenorrhea.’ The
birth interval difference between

‘Durations of breastfeeding and of amenorthea have been found to be positively correlated
(see, for instance, Cantrelle and Leridon, 1971;
Delgado et al., 1978; Bongaarts, 1982; Van de
Walle and Van de Walle, 1989).

women who breastfeed for 15 or more
months and those who breastfeed for
less than 15 months is a pointer to this
possibility. In societies where most
women stop childbearing not necessarily because they have attained a numerically well-defined family size but either
because other women of their age are
stopping childbearing or because they
are approaching menopause, a shortening of birth intervals may push up fertility, at least in the short run. If, however,
there are numerically well-defined family sizes, reduction in birth intervals may
have no impact on total fertility. But
then, the health implications of short
birth intervals for women in many societies that are characterized by high levels of protein-energy malnutrition are of
great concern. In the absence of proteinenergy foods, short birth intervals make
an adequate renewal of the body systems impossible; thus women are illprepared to withstand the strains of subsequent pregnancy and parturition.

Unlike an earlier finding (Lesthaege
et al., 1981), users of efficient contraception are not found to have longer
birth intervals than those who do not use
contraception. A plausible reason for
this is that many women use contraception only to prevent becoming pregnant
too soon after the last birth. Such
women use contraception only to attain
a normative minimum interval.
