S ABSTRACT: Around the world, populations have experienced shortages of one sex or the other
sat marriageable ages, as a result of mortality declines. The solutions to this problem vary with
the cultural context. Declines in the spousal age difference and increases in dowry payments
o(India) and polygamy (Africa) are two adjustments to a disequilibrium in the marriage market.
© We hypothesize that in Brazil the marriage market finds its balance by ‘‘recycling” men through
highly unstable informal unions. Using census and 1984 survey data, we establish the relationOship between a marriage squeeze and the increase in informal marriage. Census data and a
‘competing-risks analysis of marriage choice provide evidence that a marriage squeeze has
coaffected both the chances of marrying at all and the type of marriage entered.

An over- or under-supply of men or
women in the marriage market brings
about a situation which is referred to as
Sa “marriage squeeze” —a shortage of
“one sex or the other in the age group in
pwhich marriage generally occurs. Such
Za disequilibrium is a consequence of a
zsharp increase in population growth
rates either through a drop in mortality
>or a rise in fertility. This increase in
ythe growth rate results in younger coShorts of a larger size than older
cohorts, which, combined with the fact
= that women marry men who are on avAerage older than they, results in a surplus of women in the marriage market.
The extent of the squeeze depends

on the average age difference between
husband and wife at marriage, the population growth rate, and the substitutability of other desired traits in the
marriage market such as wealth and

schooling. To put it in other words,

how easy is it for an older woman to
“make up” for her age with her other
attributes (Schirm, 1986; Rao, 1991).

Various explanations have been offered for the frequency and persistence
of age differences between men and
women who marry. One of the most
succinct and intuitively appealing is
that of Guttentag and Secord (1983).
They relate differences in age between
husband and wives to power relations
between the sexes. Power relations, in
turn, result from a combination of
“dyadic” and structural forces. Dyadic
forces refer to the dynamics between
the sexes brought about by the relative
supply of men and women. Structural
forces have to do with the relative status of one sex or the other in the society. It is probably the latter that determines the widely observed fact
that husbands are generally several
years older than their wives. How else
could one explain a remarkably consistent age difference between spouses
throughout the world?

Since most populations in developing countries have experienced fairly
recent sharp declines in mortality and

tend to have large age differences at
marriage, they have been subject to
marriage squeezes. Depending on the
social context, there are several solutions to this problem in the marriage
market:

(1) The age at marriage for the two
sexes could be adjusted, and people
could marry others nearer to their own
ages.

(2) Some women could remain single, as happened in Europe in the past
(Watkins 1981) and as may be becoming
more common in the United States.

(3) Men could marry more than one
woman, as ts done in polygynous Africa
(Guttentag and Secord, 1983).

(4) Men could move between various unstable relationships, “sharing”
themselves among several women over
time.

Every society adapts to a marriage
squeeze according to the institutional
structure of its marriage market. In
South Asia, where there is early and
universal marriage and transactions
between affinal households at the time
of marriage are common, the marriage
squeeze has resulted in a rise in the
age of marriage of women and a consequent increase in dowry payments
(Caldwell et al., 1983; Rao, 1993). In
Sub-Saharan Africa where polygamy
is a well-established institution, the
squeeze has resulted in an increase in
the prevalence of men with more than
one wife (Guttentag and Secord, 1983;
Goldman and Pebley, 1989).

In this paper we explore the fourth
adaptation to a marriage squeeze—
the faster “recycling” of men through
relatively unstable informal unions.
We hypothesize that this mechanism
explains, at least in part, the rise in

 

Social Biology

informal marriage in Brazil and may be
related to an increase in marital
instability.

We make an important assumption
here, namely that men are more likely
than women to prefer informal marriages, while women in general prefer formal marriage. This assumption
makes sense when one thinks about
differences in sex roles. Men might
well prefer informal unions because
their obligations are less well-defined,
and they can more easily dissolve the
unions. Women prefer legal unions because they provide greater economic
support and protection.! Fieldwork in
Brazil conducted by one of the authors
(Greene, 1991) corroborates the fact
that most women in consensual unions
have resigned themselves to their circumstances, while the men had generally not thought about doing things
otherwise.

We argue that women with less
power are more likely to end up in
marriages which they do not care for,
i.e., consensual unions. Yet if power is
the issue, why is it that men of higher
socioeconomic status are not more
likely than their poorer counterparts to
enter informal marriages? The reason
is that in the upper classes formal
marriage is more common, due in part
to the legal constraints of property
ownership and so on. Social classes

1The idea that informal marriage is influenced
by the human capital and other resources available
to men and women is also explored by GrossbardShechtman (1982) in her analysis of the determinants of informal marriage in Guatemala. In another paper (1985), Grossbard-Schechtman has
hypothesized that the rise in the incidence of cohabitation in the United States could be due to a marriage squeeze.

are fairly endogamous. Our argument
looks at a pattern visible within social
classes rather than the one observed by
making comparisons across social class
(see Rao and Greene, 1990).

BACKGROUND
HIstory OF MARRIAGE IN BRAZIL

Informal or consensual unions have
been common historically in Latin
America, and Brazil is no exception.
Throughout Brazil’s history of colonization, slavery, and consequent racial
intermingling, informal unions have
been a viable alternative to formal
marriage. The church tried to ignore
the Portuguese men who, though married to women who had stayed in Portugal, often took Native American
wives. In parts of Brazil, slaves were
not allowed to marry and, throughout
the country, the commonplace unions
between white masters and black
women were never formalized. People
living in remote areas were often too
isolated to seek legal or religious sanction for their marriages. Race, socioeconomic characteristics, and other

factors have been offered as explana
tions for the widespread tradition of informal marriage in Brazil (Henriques,
1980; Berqu6é and Loyola, 1984; Goldani, 1981; Silva, 1979; Mortara, 1956;
Heredia and Heredia, 1983; Quinteiro,
1988; Kogut, 1976; Berqué, 1987).
Consensual unions form a substantial proportion of all unions in Brazil.
In 1960, for instance, the first time the
Brazilian census included “consensual
union” as a marital category, 3.7 per
cent of women older than 15 placed
themselves in that category. By 1980,

Informal Marriage

 

67

this proportion had increased to about
10 per cent. Figure 1 shows the change
in the proportion of informal marriages
over time by region.

As for growth and the balance of
fertility and mortality in Brazil, between 1950 and 1960 expectation of life
at birth rose from 43.6 to 49.6 years. In
the next decade, it rose to 53.4 years;
and in the next, to nearly 62 years
(Wood and Carvalho, 1988). The most
rapid gains have taken place during the
past twenty years, and this fact has
great significance for the population
profile today. Another important point
is that the mortality decline was not felt
the same way throughout the population. The sharp and recent mortality
decline resulted from great improvements in socioeconomic conditions
during the 1970’s (Wood and Carvalho, 1988). Changes would have
been felt the most among people of
lower socioeconomic status who stood
to gain the most in terms of expectation
of life.

It was not until 1980 that population
growth rates began to decline due to
reductions in fertility. We believe that
these vital events and the increase in
informal marriage are not coincidental. We believe that the increase in the
population growth rate directly contributed to a rise in informal unions,
which have been integrally related to
instability.

A related argument has been made
about the proportions of women of
different ages who are not currently
married (who may be single, divorced,
separated, or widowed). These proportions also have increased with time:

Those who never married, those who
separated and never remarried, those

who were widowed and did not marry
again, in short, the most varied conjugal paths taken, associated with the
excess of women in Brazil, with the increase in differential mortality by sex,
the preference of men for younger
women for marriage and remarriage,
and the growing volume of separations,
all of this explains the pyramid of the
non-married (Oliveira and Berqué,
1985, p. 5).

Oliveira and Berqué further argue that
women have children by men and then
content themselves with “‘truncated’’
families, without the presence of a
spouse, all as a result of the marriage
squeeze. The possibility that an everincreasing proportion of single women
explains the situation in the marriage
market is not corroborated by census
data, as we can see in Figure 2.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INFORMAL
UNIONS

_ Informal unions tend to be unfavorable to women, and this effect is stronger as one goes down the economic
scale. The reason is that in the eventuality of a divorce, women have less
or no financial support. The fact that
women generally earn less than men—
and are further handicapped in that
they are generally responsible for any
children born in the union— means that
in the United States women drop in socioeconomic class as they get divorced
(McLanahan, 1989). In a predominantly Catholic society where divorce
is difficult or unaffordable, consensual
unions are far easier to break off than
religious unions. Fieldwork interviews
indicate that informal unions may be

preferred by men for these very reasons (Greene, 1991).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We examine our hypothesis with a
unique retrospective survey of a 0.5
per cent sample of the population of
Brazilian households. A National
Household Survey (PNAD) is taken
every year, with a different theme explored each time. The theme of the
1984 PNAD was marriage and fertility
(FIBGE, 1987; Lazo, 1988). Women
were asked about the details of their
marital and birth histories. The data
also include information on schooling
and income. To these individual-level
data, we have added state-level information on sex ratios and rates of labor

force participation dating back to 1950,
thus giving both temporal and spatial
variability in the aggregate data.
Given the extent of heterogeneity in
matriage patterns in Brazil and variations in the ages at marriage of men
and women, it is impossible to find an
index of the marriage squeeze that accurately reflects the pool of potential
marital partners. Thus, we do not attempt to do so. We instead construct a
measure of the age structure of the
population that includes most of the
range within which marriage-age differences may fit. We divide the number
of men between the ages of 25 and 34
by the number of women 15 to 24. This
measure is admittedly exaggerated,
but it provides us with more variation
across time and region than alternative

specifications. It also proved the most
sensitive measure in terms of providing
the most precise estimates in predicting
both marriage and divorce.”

- One problem with the 1984 PNAD
survey—and with most demographic
surveys (Pollak, 1990; Bergstrom and
Lam, 1989)—is that it does not provide
the corresponding marital histories of
men, thus preventing us from directly
measuring the relative rates of recycling. Another problem is that the information on the previous unions of
a woman does not include any more
information on her spouse at the time
other than his age at marriage. This
lack of data prevents us from doing
a full analysis of how considerations
of spouse “quality” interact with the
decision to enter an informal union.
While unions that are currently surviving have complete information on both
husbands and wives, doing an analysis
only of currently surviving unions
would introduce a strong selectivity
bias as consensual unions have a
high probability of dissolving. Thus,
our analysis includes information from
both past and current unions.

We present evidence from both the
PNAD survey and from Brazilian censuses to track trends in marriage patterns, marriage age differences, and
relative rates of divorce between men
and women. We then present results
from a logistic analysis of choosing
between formal and informal unions.
Following, we present a_ discrete
time competing-risks analysis (Allison,
1982) of marriage timing and choice of
the type of union.

2We do not provide estimates of models with
other marriage squeeze measures but these are
available from the authors upon request.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows the trends in proportions of formal and informal marriages
across each successive marriage cohort. It is clear that with each cohort,
consensual unions have become a substantially larger proportion of all marriages.

Table 2 shows the trends in the proportion of unions of different types
across regions. Before the 1960 census,
women who were in consensual unions
were considered either single or married, depending on their exact circumstances and how they answered the
questions of the census-taker. One can
see considerable regional variation in
the incidence of informal marriage in
Brazil. The North had the highest
proportions of women in consensual
unions in 1960, and also in 1970. The
Northeast and Center West had the
next highest levels of informal marriage in 1970. In 1980 and in 1984,
according to the PNAD survey data,
the Northeast, Southeast, and Center
West had comparable levels of consensual unions, higher than in the past, but
not quite as high as in the North. The
regional variation is related to the distribution of racial and socioeconomic
groups throughout Brazil, as well as regional histories and economic systems
that are widely divergent.

We discussed above some of the solutions to the problem of constriction
in the marriage market. If recycling is
the solution in Brazil, men must pass
through more unions than women.
This relative instability of consensual
unions means that a reduction in the
age difference between partners is not
required to resolve the inequities of the
marriage squeeze. Those couples who

numbers in this sort of union. The
mean age difference between husband
and wife is consistently lower in formal
marriages, lending credence to the
idea that the solution to the marriage
squeeze found by those who will only
enter formal marriages is to find partners closer to their own ages.

One can think of the Brazilian marriage market as being broken into two
subgroups—those who stick to formal
unions, and those who will enter informal unions. The marriage squeeze
causes couples who will form only formal unions to reduce gaps in their ages
at marriage as they do not have the
“recycling” option to ensure that everyone will have a marital partner at
least once. Table 3 shows that in informal marriages, the husband is more
likely to be much older than husbands in formalized marriages. This
finding suggests different mechanisms
of reaching an equilibrium in these two
marriage markets. This bifurcation in
the marriage market may partly exist
because many consensual unions are
second or higher order unions, in
which men have often had more previous experience than women. The
level of informal marriage by order of
the marriage (for women) appears in
Figure 4. It is clear that many informal
marriages are second or higher order
unions; informal unions do, however,
make up an important proportion of
first marriages.

The more intense the marriage
squeeze, the more important the use of
informal marriage to even out the marriage market. This is what we see in
Figure 5, which plots the proportion of
women in informal marriages by increasing sex ratios by each of four marriage cohorts. What we see here is that

as the sex ratio increases, i.e., as the
supply of men in relation to women becomes more plentiful, women are less
likely to enter informal marriages. It
appears that a more balanced ratio of
potential husbands and wives increases
the prevalence of formal marriages
which tend to be longer lasting (Goldman and Pebley, 1981).

LoaIsTic ANALYSIS OF TYPE OF
MARRIAGE

We first analyze the probability of
women choosing consensual unions.
The dependent variable in these results
is dichotomous, being 1 if a woman entered an informal marriage, and 0 if she
entered a formal marriage (Aldrich
and Nelson, 1984). The results are presented in Table 4 (first unions) and Table 5 (second and higher order unions).

We will focus on the results most important to a marriage squeeze argument. Controlling for other possible
causes, we find that the sex ratio has a
negative and significant effect on the
likelihood of entering an informal
union. As the sex ratio increases and
there are more men available in the

marriage market, women are less likely
to end up in consensual unions.

Confirming this finding, we note
that the coefficient for the difference
between the husbands’ and wives’ ages
is positive. This positive coefficient is
further support for the idea that a marriage squeeze is behind the rise in consensual unions. It suggests that when a
reduction in the spousal age difference
is not used as a solution to the marriage
squeeze, entry into informal marriage
is used.

The ratio of men’s and women’s
labor force participation rates (the activity ratio) has a positive effect on informal marriage. AS women form a
larger proportion of the total labor
force relative to men, informal marriage may be a more attractive alter
native. (Women may also opt out of
marriage entirely, which is explored in
the competing risks analysis which follows.) The activity ratio could indicate
a departure from a more traditional
setup in which women stay at home
while the men to whom they are formally married go out to work. In this
case, the activity ratio serves as a proxy
for the degree of traditionalism in a
state during a particular period. It appears that in areas where more women
are participants in the paid labor force,
the norms emphasizing formal marriage are weaker, and women are freer
to enter informal unions. While we
give this norm-related explanation for
the effects of women’s activity rates,
our explanation for the male activity
rate is more purely economic.

wise have initiated new formal marriages, compromised and lived in informal unions. To acknowledge this
important legal change, a dummy variable for marriages which took place after 1979 was created. While it appears
not to have a particularly strong effect
on the choice of first marriage, the positive effect is in the expected direction.
Some of the effect of the dummy variable marking 1979 and after may be
stolen away by the control for year of
marriage. With each passing year, a
woman is more likely to enter an informal first marriage. The more traditional attitudes toward marriage one
might expect from an older woman
may account for the fact that the higher
the age at marriage, the lower the likelihood of entering an informal union.

The controls for race (the reference
category is White) have the expected
effects. Asians are very unlikely to enter consensual unions, being more traditional in their marriage patterns.
Black and mulatta women are considerably more likely to enter informal marriages than are white women.
This finding may have something to do
with their regional concentration and

constraints in the regional marriage
© markets.
The number of children born previE ous to the marriage has a positive and
® substantial effect on the chances of eno« tering an informal marriage, even
<= when controlling for whether or not a
>. woman was pregnant at the time of
"_ marriage. Having children may put
women at a disadvantage when they
Sare looking for a new partner. Being
- pregnant at the time of marriage has a
S positive effect on entering an informal
‘= union, perhaps because the whole sequence of pregnancy and marriage is
< less planned.
Schooling substantially decreases
~ the likelihood of entering an informal

'y the cross-class pattern coexisting with
3 an intra-class pattern. Years of school“= ing may be a proxy for general socio= economic factors which relate to propC erty and thus to the need to formalize
a marriage. Furthermore, schooling
may indicate greater power of a
woman to negotiate a marriage on the
terms she wishes.

Living in an urban area is another

factor that clearly raises the likelihood

ber 20

nive

b

of marrying into a consensual union

rather than a formal marriage. Historically, consensual unions were most
common among the rural poor, while
they are now increasingly common

Informal Marriage 77

among women in cities. More and
more, consensual unions are being
used as experimental marriages by urban women, whether they are financially independent or not.

To touch briefly on the different
findings with regard to entering an informal second marriage, overall, the
effects have the same signs but have
lost in significance. Certain variables
should be emphasized because these
are second or higher order marriages.
The dummy variable for whether a
woman married after 1979 seems to
have the most explanatory power,
which almost certainly has to do with
an increase in dissolution at that time.
The number of children born previously has an important positive effect
on entering a consensual union, and
most of these women probably do have
children from previous marriages.

COMPETING RISKS ANALYSIS

The results of the logistic analysis
must be interpreted as providing estimates of the conditional probability of
entering a formal or informal union
once individuals have made the decision to stay together. Table 5 presents
two more realistic models of the marriage decision in a competing risks
model, where the chances of entering a
formal marriage, informal marriage, or
staying single are assumed to be part of
the same choice. This method mixes
the concept of a life table with a logistic
regression (Allison, 1982, 1984; Hoffman and Duncan, 1988; W. Greene,
1988). For every year that a woman is
single, she can decide to remain single
or to enter one or another sort of marriage. These are mutually exclusive options, and she is exposed to the risk of .
these different possibilities every year

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

78 Greene and Rao

until she marries, when she is no longer
at risk.

The observations represent, in fact,
the accumulated experience of women
up until and including the year of marriage, or the total number of years in
which they ran the risk of marrying, entering a consensual union, or remaining single. After marrying, a woman’s
experience is no longer included in this
analysis.

The characteristics that vary
throughout the life of the person (like
age, for example) also vary in the analysis. Other fixed characteristics (like
race) are obviously the same for all of
a person’s years of experience. The dependent variable, marital status, has
three categories: ““O” for a woman
who remains single that year, ‘‘1” for a
woman who enters a formal marriage,
and ‘‘2”’ for a woman who enters a consensual union.

Model 1 of the analysis, which focuses on culture and individual resources, shows that race has strong effects on marriage and marriage choice.
Black women are less likely to enter
formal marriages and more likely to
enter informal marriages than are
white women (the coefficient is —0.622
for formal marriages, and 0.392 for informal ones). The situation is nearly
the same for mixed-race women. Asian
women, on the other hand, are not that
different from white women with respect to entering formal marriage versus remaining single (the coefficient for
formal marriage is not significant).
They are, however, much less likely
to enter informal marriages (—2.398).
The fact that the signs of the coefficients change when we are looking at
formal and informal marriage suggests
that certain options are more salient

 

 

Social Biology

depending on these women’s cultural
background. Clearly informal marriage is much more of a possibility for
black and mixed-race women than for
white or Asian women.

The measures of structural constraints in this first model, controlling
for urban residence and birth year, are
similar in reducing the chances of entering a formal marriage and increasing
the chances of entering a consensual
union (the coefficients for urban residence are —1.189 for formal marriage,
and 0.460 for informal; those of year of
birth are —0.011 and 0.058, respectively). We view these highly significant factors as measures of the weakened influence of tradition on behavior
over time and space.

Individual resources also appear
very predictive of the chances of entering a formal or informal marriage
versus remaining single. Years of
schooling make any kind of marriage
less likely, but the effect is greater
in reducing the chances of entering
informal marriage (the coefficients
are —Q.032 for formal marriages,
and —0Q.133 for consensual unions).
Schooling affects both the way someone spends her time (whether or not
she is in school), and her future expectations (through investment in human
capital and later work experience and
wealth).

We have tried to control for the role
of wealth by including a dummy variable for unearned income, which has
the surprising effect of reducing the
likelihood of entering a formal marriage and increasing the likelihood of
entering an informal one. This goes
completely against our expectations,
and indeed, against what the literature
on the relationship of socioeconomic

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

Vol. 42, No. 1-2

factors to marriage choice suggests.
Clearly there is heterogeneity among
the group of women who enter informal marriages that is not being captured in this model. It is also possible,
all else being equal, the rare women
who have greater financial independence may prefer informal marriage.

The final measures of individual resources in Model 1 are the age categories. These are counted as resources,
because age is so clearly associated
with other lifecourse events which affect the position from which a woman
negotiates her marriage. Women ages
14 to 19 are equally less likely to marry
than to remain single compared to the
reference category of women ages 20
to 24 (0.871 and —0.860, for formal
and consensual unions, respectively).
Starting at age 25, however, the effects
of age on entering a formal or informal
marriage begin to diverge. While
women are less and less likely to enter
formal marriages compared to the reference group after this age, they are
more likely to enter consensual unions
until they are 35-39 (— 1.533 for formal
and 0.188 for informal unions). After
that age, women are again less likely to
enter informal marriages than remain
single compared to the reference
group. It appears that informal marriage remains an option after the conventional ages for marriage have been
passed by, while formal marriage is
more rigidly contained in the early
20’s.

Model 2 adds structural factors
which attenuate some of the other influences, including the sex ratio, region, and female activity rates. The
proportion of women working appears
to reduce the chances of entering a formal marriage compared to remaining

 

Informal Marriage 79

single, while increasing the likelihood
of entering a consensual union (—3.945
and 3.167 for the two types of marriage, respectively). The coefficients
for the sex ratio, of most concern to us,
show that a greater supply of men substantially increases the chances of entering a formal marriage rather than of
remaining single (0.966). At the same
time, it appears to have no effect on
distinguishing entry into informal marriage versus remaining single. If not
marrying and entering an informal
marriage are influenced in the same
way by the supply of potential male
partners, it would seem that informal
marriage is more closely related to singlehood than formal marriage is.

The effect of race is reduced by the
addition of regional controls, partly because of the concentration of blacks in
the Northeast and whites in the South.
Women from the Northeast are somewhat less likely to enter formal marriages and somewhat more likely to enter informal ones than stay single than
are women in the rest of the country
(-—0.095 for formal marriage, 0.173
for consensual union). This effect is
greatly magnified among women living
in the North, where the chances of entering an informal marriage appear to
be the highest in the country (—0.309
and 0.633, respectively). This effect is
mirrored in the South, where women
are considerably more likely to enter
formal marriages, rather than remain
single, than elsewhere (0.154 and
—0.037).

The effects of personal socioeconomic resources are quite similar to
those in Model 1, with years of schooling reducing the chances of entering
any sort of marriage relative to remaining single. Having unearned income
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

80 Greene and Rao

again makes women less likely to enter
formal marriages and more likely to
enter informal ones, rather than to remain single. This finding may be due in
part to the fact that the unearned income variable is a measure of current
wealth which we impute to these
women in the past.

Once again, being in the youngest
age group reduces women’s chances of
marrying at all, relative to the group
of women ages 20 to 24. From age 25
to age 40, however, women are more
likely to enter informal marriages than
remain single relative to the reference
group. The negative effects of age on
the chances of entering a formal marriage become stronger and stronger,
and are always highly significant.

A final piece of evidence that a recycling mechanism may be the solution
to a marriage squeeze in Brazil is presented in Figure 6. The figure uses Brazilian census data from 1980. On the X
axis, we have plotted the state-level sex
ratios, the number of males aged 25 to
29 divided by the number of females
aged 15 to 19. On the Y axis we plot the
ratio of divorce rates for men and
women. The measure of the relative
rates of divorce for men and women
uses census data. The index we employ
is

# Divorced Men
# Ever Married Men

# Divorced Women
# Ever Married Women

We can see that as the state-level sex
ratio increases, this index increases.
This finding indicates that as the supply
of men increases, the divorce rates
of men become more like those of
women. In other words, as the deficit
of men in the marriage market is
reduced, the easier it becomes for

Social Biology

women to marry, to stay married, or to
remarry, just as it becomes more difficult for men to achieve these same
goals.

CONCLUSIONS

It is hard to tell a two-sex story from
data collected about the experiences of
only one. The hypothesis we have tried
to test should ideally have been directly examined with data on the marital histories of both men and women.
However, in the absence of such data,
we believe that the patchwork of evidence that we have assembled from the
PNAD survey and Brazilian censuses,
in their totality, tell a convincing story.
In the context of Brazil’s high degree
of marital instability, the marriage
squeeze has been resolved with the increased recycling of men through multiple unions. As informal unions are
the most unstable type of union, this
process has resulted in an increase in
the incidence of informal marriage.

Given the high levels of marital instability in Brazil, it is clear that informal unions and the associated “‘recycling” of marriage partners, especially
of men, together form a reasonable solution to the marriage squeeze problem. This particular response to the
marriage squeeze may be observed in
other Latin American societies with
high incidences of informal marriage
and high degrees of marital instability.
Other societies with different constraints on the marriage market and
different marriage structures have reacted in other ways, with reductions in
age differences between spouses and
increases in rates of polygyny. However, what we have tried to show is that
increases in the rate at which unions
are formed and dissolved may be yet
