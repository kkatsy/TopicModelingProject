ABSTRACT: The relationship between inbreeding as measured by isonymy and by pedigrees was
investigated in Kippel, a village in southern Switzerland. Inbreeding estimated by isonymy was
3.5 times the estimate obtained from pedigree analysis. Our results indicate a higher prevalence of
lines traced through males owing to social causes. This limited pool of potential mates has a high

frequency of shared surnames which produces the overestimate of inbreeding by isonymy.

It seems likely that studies of inbreeding
using isonymy (surname concordance) will
proliferate because of the simplicity of the
approach and the possibility of probing for
remote ancestry. However, Crow and
Mange (1965) and Hussels (1969) compared inbreeding estimates based on
pedigree analysis and on isonymy among
the Hutterites and among the residents of
Saas, a Swiss Alpine valley, and found
that in both cases isonymy revealed a
higher percentage of inbreeding than did
pedigrees. Therefore, it is of some importance that further research in similar population groups be conducted to replicate
this type of study in a variety of cultural
settings to establish or disprove that the
isonymy method produces higher inbreeding estimates than does pedigree analysis.

We therefore present data for Kippel,
Switzerland, an Alpine isolate with a living population of 450 studied by Friedl in
1969-70 and 1972.! In addition, we present further results of an inbreeding analy

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Genealogical information was gathered
from church and civil records for 136 sibships representing the pedigrees of all 450
living native residents of the village in
1970. Including living villagers, pedigree
depth allows calculation of inbreeding
through third cousins. Eventually, five
adoption and illegitimacy cases were discarded due to inability to trace either a
matrilineage or a patrilineage, leaving 131
cases for analysis. Data were coded and
punched on IBM cards for input into a
revised version of the computer program
published by MacCluer et al. (1967). Output includes breeding coefficients by generation, using the method of Kudo (1962).

Isonymy rates and inbreeding from
isonymy were calculated. This process involved tabulating surname concordance in
the 131 married parents of the sibships for
observed isonymy. Expected or random
isonymy was also calculated.2 The fre

quency of pairing of the same surname at
random is the sum of the products of the
incidence of each surname in each of the
two sexes divided by the product of the
total number of names in each sex. These
observed and expected isonymy rates were
then substituted in formulae presented in
Hussels (1969, pp. 473-474) and solved for
random (#), nonrandom (a), and total (F;)
inbreeding.

RESULTS

In 131 sibships representing the living
native population of Kippel as of 1970,
pedigree analysis shows that the mean inbreeding coefficient after nine generations
of inbreeding was 0.0090. This figure almost doubles our previous estimate based
on church dispensations (Friedl and Ellis,
1974, p. 706). Parents had the same surname in 16/131 or 12.2 per cent of these
sibships 7). Combining sexes and letting q;
be the frequency of the 7th surname in these
sibships, random isonymy is estimated as

=i = 0.102.
The nonrandom component of the inbreeding coefficient is
a = (I ~ Xq7)/4(1 — Zq?) = 0.006.
The random component is
@ = Xq?2/4 = 0.026.

The total inbreeding coefficient is therefore

Inbreeding and Isonymy 159

F=a+(1—a)¢ = 0.032.

Therefore, known consanguinity contributes only 0.0090/0.032, or about 28 per
cent, of the inbreeding revealed by
isonymy. In Table 1 we compare these
results to those of recent studies.

DISCUSSION

The relationship between isonymy and
inbreeding has recently been reviewed by
Roberts and Rawling (1974). In summary,
isonymy and inbreeding are related based
upon the constant relationship between
the probability of affinal relatives having
the same surname (P) and the inbreeding
coefficient of their possible offspring (F),
such that P/F is always equal to 4. In the
case of sibs, the probability of having the
same surname is 1 and the inbreeding coefficient is one-fourth so that P/F equals 4.
In first-cousin marriages made at random,
since there are four types, one out of four
couples will have identical surnames.
Therefore, the probability of isonymy is
one-fourth. Their inbreeding coefficient is
one-sixteenth. Therefore, P/F equals 4
again.

In general, the probability that relatives
of any given degree have the same surname because of inheritance from a common male ancestor is always four times the
inbreeding coefficient for offspring of that
type of mating. Therefore, an observed
value of the proportion of isonymous pairs
divided by 4 gives the inbreeding value of

the population. In general, we may write k
= ¢/C (Morton and Hussels, 1970, p. 68),
where k is concordance of names due to
kinship and where C equals 4 on the null
hypothesis of random sex labeling (i.e.,
that marriages of brothers’ children make
up one-fourth of first-cousin matings).

In order to test this null hypothesis,
Hussels (1969) regressed isonymy as a binary variable (0, 1) on the coefficient of
inbreeding estimated from pedigrees. C
was equal to 4.58 + 0.72, in good agreement with the expected value of 4. In Kippel, we found C equaled 6.77 + 1.72, and
this value is not significantly different
from the value of 4 expected on the basis
of random distribution of the types of
cousin marriage.

We further tested whether patrilineal
chains of relationship were preferred in
consanguineous marriages, a possibility
suggested to us by Morton (personal communication, 1974). We found such a preference (Fried! and Ellis, 1974, Table 3).
However, the number of cases was too
small to produce an unequivocal finding.
But if this is so, it means either that patrilineal chains of relationship are more
prevalent than expected or, alternatively,
that matrilineal chains are harder to trace.
Two social explanations for this result are
partible inheritance and patrilocality.

Since relationship among members of
the same surname group (Stamm) is recognized, these results also seem to contradict
the villagers’ awareness of possible congenital diseases being transmitted and
compounded through marriage of close
relatives (Friedl, 1974, p. 27). However,
this awareness is relatively recent in its
effects upon the choice of marriage
partners.

Consanguineous marriage is not a preferred type of marriage in Kippel, and
first-cousin marriages are uncommon.
Therefore, the closed nature of the Kippel
gene pool may have imposed a certain

level of inbreeding on the population. A
similar phenomenon has been reported for
the Amish (McKusick et al., 1964), on
Tristan de Cunha (Roberts, 1967), and in
Isle-aux-Coudres (Philippe and Gomila,
1972). To test for this phenomenon in
Kippel, we grouped married pairs by generation and calculated the proportion of
observed isonymous marriages and the
frequency of expected matches according
to the method of Yasuda and Furusho
(1971). Figure 1 demonstrates that random

inbreeding gradually builds through time
and most of the variation in total inbreeding is due to nonrandom inbreeding.

The apparent preference for isonymous
mates within consanguinity groups is
therefore most probably due to a limited
number of different-surname potential
mates among the local residents. This limitation is a result of the Alpine setting of
the village, which severely limited in- or
out-migration.

The isonymy approach assumes that
spouses are chosen without regard to surnames. However, as pointed out by Reid

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 23, No. 2

(1973, p. 97), in some societies surnames
are an important consideration in the
choice of spouses. In South India, using
Reid’s example, there is a strong preference for consanguineous marriage linked
with a total prohibition of isonymous marriage. Using isonymy to estimate inbreeding in this case would have yielded an
estimated inbreeding coefficient of zero.

A similar argument holds for the apparent preference for consanguinity in isonymous pairs in Kippel. Certainly the observed numbers of isonymous unions are
significantly in excess of those expected,
and these estimate F in this case to be
about 3.5 times the estimate obtained by
pedigree analysis. The extent to which this
figure is an overestimate of the true value
attributable to the isonymy method is not
clear.

CONCLUSIONS

The population of Kippel, Switzerland,
has been subjected to both an isonymic
and a full-pedigree analysis. Isonymy

overestimated pedigree inbreeding. This
overestimate may be due in part to truncation of pedigrees (Roberts, 1969) or to
prevalence of patrilineal chains of relationship which, combined with inheritance pattern and patrilocality, has resulted in a proliferation of relatives within
the pool of potential mates and the development of a certain degree of inbreeding. As these relatives often share patrinyms, isonymy will tend to overestimate
pedigree inbreeding.
