ABSTRACT: This paper considers whether marital instability varies by the duration between
marriage and first birth among ever-married white and black American women. Analysis of
Odata from the June 1985 Current Population Survey suggests that the duration between
A marriage and first birth has a generally monotonic relationship with the probability of white
oo Women separating or divorcing from their first marriage; the relationship has remained
© relatively constant over time. For blacks, no consistent association is found between marital
st dissolution and the duration between marriage and first birth. Black women having a
© premarital conception and postmarital birth and those having their first birth during their
+3second year of marriage have a similarly high risk of dissolution. Conversely, blacks having
rotheir first birth 8-12 or 25-42 months after marrying have a low probability of dissolution.

9 S 1979). Although indications are that the
5 divorce rate has stabilized (National
Center for Health Statistics, 1987a), the
— large proportion of marriages ending in
3 3 divorce clearly has societal implications.
& Researchers have identified various facF tors (e.g., age at marriage, education,
A year of marriage, place of residence,
and premarital pregnancy) that are associated with marital instability (Morgan
and Rindfuss, 1985; McKie et al., 1983;
Teachman, 1982; McCarthy and
Menken, 1979; Bumpass and Sweet,
1972). Although premarital pregnancy
is related to marital instability, results
are inconclusive as to whether women
having a premarital birth or a premarital
pregnancy with a postmarital birth have
the greater probability of divorce. Furthermore, relatively little research has

 

focused on the relationship between the
timing of postmarital births (or no
births) and marital instability.

The purpose of this paper is to determine whether marital instability varies
by the duration between marriage and
first birth among United States women
married between 1960-84. Marital instability is measured by both divorce
and separation. The analysis is done
separately for whites and blacks. To determine any recent changes in the relationship between the duration from
marriage to first birth and marital instability, we examine the data separately
by marriage cohort.

The arrival of a newborn infant is a
stressful time for the parents, regardless
of the child’s birth order. In particular,
the first birth creates an interpersonal
crisis for the parents (LeMasters, 1957)
with its accompanying marital stress.
The psychological and emotional demands of caring for a newborn infant

can adversely affect the course of a marriage. Furthermore, the first birth reduces the couple’s time for nonfamilial
activities. Since adjustments must be
made after the first birth, and since the
duration between marriage and first
birth may affect a couple’s ability to
make these adjustments, the timing of
the first birth could affect marital discord. For example, those having a first
birth shortly after marriage have not had
enough time to adjust to marriage itself
before facing the additional marital
strain, including economic pressure, of
having a child.

The divorce rate has risen steadily
from 1960 to the early 1980's; it has stabilized in the last few years (National
Center for Health Statistics, 1986a).
The timing of the first birth has changed
significantly since 1960. For example,
women have recently delayed their first
birth until later in life (National Center
for Health Statistics, 1986b; Bloom,
1982). The proportion of premarital
births has also increased tremendously
during the past 25 years (National Center for Health Statistics, 1986b; Grabill,
1976). These changes may have altered
the relationship between the timing of
the first birth and marital instability. By
analyzing the data by marriage cohort, it
is possible to identify any changes in the
relationship between the timing of the
first birth and marital instability.

It may be hypothesized that childless
women, delayed childbearers, and those
premaritally pregnant are more likely to
divorce or separate than others. However, different factors are responsible
for their greater tendency to divorce.
For example, delayed childbearers often establish a career before beginning
childbearing and thus their greater
finances may remove a major obstacle
(i.e., financial security) preventing di

vorce. Additionally, the occurrence of a
first birth this long after marriage may
be the result of severe pressure placed
on one of the spouses to have children,
thus producing marital discord. Childless women, more so than delayed childbearers, are often financially secure career women who do not have the
economic pressures to stay in a marriage. Additionally, their emphasis on a
career in the work force may produce
marital strain.

Women with a premarital birth may
be limited in their search for an acceptable spouse (Becker et al., 1977), which
may result in greater marital instability.
Because a relatively small percentage of
husbands are the biological fathers of
their wives’ premaritally conceived first
birth, the husbands may have less emotional ties to these children. Women
having a premarital conception and
postmarital birth (1-7 months after marriage) are generally “forced” into marriage earlier than desired and before
they are emotionally or psychologically
prepared for this type of commitment.
The couple also has had little time to develop strong interpersonal ties or become financially secure before the arrival of this child, thus increasing their
risk of marital disruption.

Conversely, a longer first birth interval may promote marital stability by giving the couple time to adjust to marriage
and develop strong interpersonal ties
before the arrival of the child. Likewise,
waiting a few years after marriage to begin childbearing allows the couple time
to acquire the finances necessary to rear
a child and thus reduce marital tension

' that is brought on by economic pressure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data source for this study is the
June 1985 Current Population Survey,
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

Vol. 35, No. 1-2

which is a probability sample survey selected to represent the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United
States living in households. The primary
purpose of the Current Population Survey is to provide monthly labor force estimates of the population. Additionally,
the June 1985 survey contained supplementary questions on marital and fertility history. It is the supplemental questions that provide the basic data of the
study.

The study population consists of
22,977 ever-married white and black
women whose first marriage occurred
between 1960-84 and before the age of
36. Because the study focuses on the
timing of the first birth in relation to date
of marriage, it is necessary to exclude
those women with relatively little time
remaining after marriage for childbearing. Only 2 per cent of the women married after age 35, and thus their exclusion should have no significant effect on
the results. The timing of the first birth is
measured by the first birth interval and
marital instability is measured by both
separation and divorce. First birth interval is defined as the duration from first
marriage to first birth, with first births
occurring before marriage and no births
forming separate categories of this variable. The analysis focuses on the probability of separation and divorce for a
woman’s first marriage. Results are expressed as the cumulative proportion of
women separating or divorcing within ¢
months of their date of marriage. The
analysis is done separately for white and
black women. To assess any changes in
the relationship between the first birth
interval and marital instability, we examine the data separately by marriage
cohort.

Life table analysis is used to estimate
the proportion of women separating or

divorcing within specified times after becoming married. Because data from the
June 1985 Current Population Survey
are cross-sectional, the extent to which
currently married women with spouse
present may separate or divorce is unknown. To minimize the problems associated with truncated marriage intervals, the life table method, based on
analysis of open and closed intervals, is
used to determine the probability of separation and divorce.

There is one limitation, inherent
when studying the timing of the first
birth and marital instability, that warrants discussion. Basically, because
marital instability may cause delayed
childbearing (childlessness) or vice
versa, it is hard to interpret an observed
association between marital instability
and childlessness (or delayed childbearing). However, examining the pattern
between the timing of the first birth and
marital instability within 25 years after
marriage makes it possible to infer
which variable has the primary causal
impact since one can observe whether
the association varies by duration of
marriage. It is expected that the effect of
marital instability on delaying childbearing should vary by duration of marriage and be greatest during the first few
years of marriage. As marital duration
increases, so does the probability of the
occurrence of the first birth, thus reducing the likelihood of a positive impact of
the presence of marital tension on delays in the tinng of the first birth. The
possibility of marital instability affecting
the timing of the first birth is negligible
among those first birth interval categories occurring near the date of marriage
(e.g., 1-7 or 8-12 months after marriage). Consequently, the results of this
study should provide useful information
on the effect of the timing of the first

birth on marital instability despite the
limitations inherent in the analysis.

RESULTS ©

In the discussion that follows, results
are presented first for divorce then for
separation. The data are tabulated separately by race with more detailed analyses done for whites, owing to their much
larger sample size.

DIVORCE

The proportion of women divorcing
by duration between marriage and first
birth, marriage cohort, and duration of
marriage is shown in Tables 1 and 2.
Overall results indicate that black and
white women have a similar probability
of divorce during the first eight years of
marriage; at longer durations, blacks
are slightly more likely to divorce. The
probability of divorce after 25 years of
marriage is 0.434 for blacks and 0.408
for whites.

Black women are grouped into two
marriage cohorts: those marrying 1960—
72 and 1973-84. The probability of divorce is greater for those marrying after
1972. For white women, there are five
marriage cohorts: those marrying 196064, 1965-69, 1970-74, 1975-79, and
1980-84. It is quite clear that at similar
durations after marriage the probability
of divorce is greater with each succeeding marriage cohort through 1975-79.
The pattern reverses itself, however,
since those married between 1980-84
are less likely to divorce during the first
five years of marriage than those married between 1975-79. Although the
results for the 1980-84 cohort are preliminary, they do support previous research indicating a recent stability and
slight reduction in the divorce rate (National Center for Health Statistics,
1986a).

Social Biology

The timing of the first birth varies by
race. For example, 20.1 per cent of
white women and 53.1 per cent of black
women have a premaritally conceived
first birth. White women, on average,
have a longer duration between marriage and first birth. Additionally, a
greater percentage of white women are
childless than blacks (19.5 per cent to
12.7 per cent).

For white women, an inverse relationship is found between first birth interval and the probability of divorce
among those having their first birth
within 36 months after marrying, including premarital births. However, the pattern reverses itself for those waiting
more than 54 months after marriage to
have their first birth. Childless women
or those having their first birth premaritally are the most likely to divorce, regardless of the duration of marriage.

Because of the smaller sample size
for blacks, those having their first birth
more than 24 months after marrying are
grouped into two categories compared
to three categories for whites. Similar to
the results for whites, blacks having
their first birth 8-12 or 25—42 months after marriage have a low probability of
divorce. Those having their first birth
the longest after marrying are also more
likely to divorce than those in the preceding category. Furthermore, at short
durations after marriage these women
are the most likely to divorce, though
they have a relatively low probability of
eventually divorcing. A major difference between the races 1s that there is no
consistent monotonic relationship between the timing of the first birth after
marriage and the probability of divorce
for blacks. The large probability of divorce for blacks having their first birth
13-24 months after marriage interrupts
any possible monotonic association and

is puzzling. Another racial difference is
that, among blacks, those having their
first birth 1-7 months after marrying
have a greater probability of divorce
than childless women or those with a
premarital birth. That is, because it is
very common for blacks to have children out-of-wedlock, its effect on the
probability of divorce may be less than
that found when women are “forced”
into marriage by a pregnancy.

To determine any recent changes in
divorce patterns by birth interval, the
data are analyzed separately by marriage cohort. The proportion of white
women divorcing within specified durations after marriage, by first birth interval, and marriage cohort is shown in Table 3. Among white women married
before 1975, an inverse association is
found between the probability of divorce and the first birth interval for
those having their first birth within 54
months after marriage, including premarital births. The association is not always monotonic. Similar to the overall
findings, the probability of divorce increases substantially for those waiting at
least 55 months after marriage to have
their first birth.

Similar to the two previous marriage
cohorts, among those married between
1975-79, childless women have the
greatest probability of divorce followed
by those with a premarital birth, and
those having their first birth 1-7 months
after marrying. The pattern differs,
however, for those having their first
birth between 8 and 54 months after
marriage since these women generally
have a similar likelihood of divorcing.
Again, those waiting the longest after
marriage to begin childbearing are more
likely to divorce than these women.

Data are available for only five years
for those married between 1980-84.

Social Biology

These preliminary results show an inverse association between the probability of divorce and the first birth interval
for those having their first birth within
36 months after marriage, including premarital births.

Regardless of the marriage cohort,
childless women or those having their
first birth premaritally have a high probability of divorce, and those women having their first birth 25-54 months after
marriage have a low probability of divorce. Among those having a postmarital conception, an inverse association
generally exists between divorce and the
first birth interval, though the pattern
changes for women having their first
birth the longest after marriage. Little
evidence is found of a convergence in
the relationship between the timing of
the first birth and the probability of divorce suggests that this pattern will continue. The stable relationship between
timing of first birth and probability of divorce for the last 25 years (suggests that
this pattern will continue).

The proportion of black women divorcing by first birth interval and marriage cohort is shown in Table 4. Results
indicate that among comparable
women, those married 1973-84 are generally more likely to divorce. Among
both marriage cohorts no consistent
monotonic relationship is found between the timing of the first birth and divorce. However, certain patterns of divorce are Clearly evident. For example,
those women having their first birth 1-7
months or greater than 42 months after
marriage have a high probability of divorce during the first 10 years of marriage. Conversely, childless women and
those having their first birth premaritally or between 8-12 and 25—42 months
after marriage have a much lower probability of divorce for the first ten years of »

marriage. The only significant difference in the pattern of divorce by marriage cohort is found for those having
their first birth between 13-24 months
after marriage. That is, among those
married 1960-72, these women are the
most likely to divorce, whereas among
those married after 1972, they have a
relatively low probability of divorce, especially during the first five years of marriage. |

Contrary to the results for whites,
blacks who are premaritally pregnant
but chose to marry before their child’s
birth are more likely to divorce than
those with a premarital birth. Consequently, the effect of being ‘“‘forced”’
into marriage by a pregnancy on marital
instability may vary by race. Black
women having their first birth the longest after marriage are much more likely
to divorce during the first ten years of
marriage but much less likely to divorce
eventually than other women. This finding suggests that while it is possible that
marital dissolution may be partially responsible for the delaying of childbearing, it appears that among those who are
married and delay the first birth the
longest, their probability of divorce is
low.

SEPARATION

Marital instability may be measured
by separation as well as divorce. Although separation usually results in divorce, some couples do reconcile
whereas others remain permanently
separated. Furthermore, the duration
between separation and divorce varies
tremendously by race with the average
duration much longer for blacks than
whites (McCarthy, 1978). Consequently, it is prudent to examine the pat
Social Biology

tern of separation by the duration between marriage and first birth.

Like divorce, life table analysis is
used to estimate the probability of separation by first birth interval. Results are
not presented in tables, however, since
the patterns are very similar for both
separation and divorce. Rather, only
the major findings are discussed.

Although black women are only
slightly more likely to divorce by 25
years after marriage than white women
(0.434 to 0.408), they are much more
likely to separate (0.597 to 0.427). It is
also quite clear that the differential
probability of divorce and separation is
much greater for blacks. Among white
women, the patterns of separation by
first birth interval are relatively similar
for each marriage cohort. That is, an inverse relationship generally exists between the timing of the first birth and the
probability of separation among those
women having their first birth within 36
months after marrying (including premarital births). Women having their
first birth premaritally generally are the
most likely to separate. For each marital
duration, women waiting the longest after marriage to begin childbearing are
more likely to separate than women
having their first birth 8-54 months after
marrying, but are less likely to separate
than women in the other first birth interval categories. It is quite evident that the
pattern of separation by first birth interval is similar to that found for divorce.
The only difference, albeit minor, between the findings for separation and divorce is that the inverse relationship
found among various first birth interval
categories and marital instability is
slightly more consistent for separation.

Like the findings for whites, the pattern of separation by first birth interval

for blacks is similar to that found for divorce. Specifically, results show no evidence of a consistent monotonic relationship between the timing of the first
birth and the probability of separation
for women married 1960-72. Among
women married after 1972, an inverse
association is found among women having their first birth 8-42 months after
marriage. As with divorce, women having their first birth 13-24 months after
marriage have the greatest probability
of separation among those married
1960-72, but are not likely to separate
among those married after 1972. Minor
differences are found in the patterns for
separation and divorce. Women married 1960-72 who have their first birth
25-42 months after marrying have a
high probability of separation but a low
probability of divorce, relative to others. Among women married 1973-84,
those having their first birth 8-12
months after marrying have a high probability of separation but are not very
likely to divorce.

CONCLUSION

Using data from the June 1985 Current Population Survey, this study has
examined whether marital instability
varies by the duration between marriage
and first birth among ever-married
white and black women married 196084. The analysis focused on whether or
not a woman was separated or divorced
from her first marriage. The findings
were similar for both divorce and separation, suggesting that either measure
may be used as an indicator of marital
instability without sacrificing accuracy.

The relationship between the first
birth interval and marital instability was

Social Biology

quite different for white and black
women. For white women an inverse association was generally found between
marital instability and first birth interval. It thus appears that women who
have longer to adjust to marriage before
beginning childbearing are more likely
to remain married than those with little
time to adjust to marriage before the arrival of a child. However, those having
their first birth more than 54 months after marriage were consistently more
likely to separate and divorce than those
having their first birth 8—54 months after
marrying, regardless of the marital duration.

Among blacks there was little evidence of a monotonic association between first birth interval and marital instability. However, certain patterns
were found. Among both marriage cohorts, women with a premarital conception but postmarital birth were likely to
separate and divorce whereas women
having their first birth 25—42 months after marriage had a low probability of
marital instability. A puzzling finding
requiring further research was that for
women having their first birth 13-24
months after marriage there was a high
risk of marital disruption for those married 1960-72, but a low risk for those
married after 1972, relative to others in
their marriage cohort.

There are additional racial differences besides the finding that the longer
the duration between marriage and first
birth the better the chances for marital
stability among whites, but not blacks.
For example, childless women and
those with premarital births generally
had the greatest probability of marital
disruption for whites, whereas for
blacks the highest probability was for
those with a premarital conception anda

postmarital birth. It is possible that
these differences occur because blacks
view the first birth and marriage differently than whites. That is, because
blacks are much more likely to have premarital births and to have a shorter duration between marriage and first birth,
blacks and whites in the same first birth
interval category may be dissimilar and
have different values resulting in a diferential effect of the timing of the first
obirth on marital instability by race.

ring a few years after marriage) and
marital instability. Because the association between first birth interval and both
separation and divorce for whites was
similar at each duration of marriage, it is
reasonable to assume that marital instability had little effect on delaying childbearing since otherwise the relationship
should have varied by duration of marriage. That is, marital instability is expected to have its strongest effect on the
timing of the first birth during the first
few years of marriage. Indeed, marital
instability may be partially responsible
for the delaying of childbearing among
blacks. However, black women who delay their first birth but are married at this
birth appear to have a relatively low risk
of separating or divorcing. Information
from this study is useful and can give insight as to the effect of the first birth interval on marital instability provided
one understands the limitations of the
study.

This study may be viewed as exploratory with the results suggesting that the
duration between marriage and first
birth is indeed related to marital disruption, though its effect varies by race.
The next step is to determine whether
the pattern of association remains while
controlling for those factors that may affect marital instability. Additionally,
more research is needed to accurately
determine how delayed childbearing affects separation and divorce, and to separate out their reciprocal causal effects.
