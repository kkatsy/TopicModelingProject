ABSTRACT: This historical prospective study is aimed at the underscoring of the independent effect
of a set of familial characteristics on age at time of death broken down into ten age groups (from 0
through 90 years and over). The study is concerned with the small rural population of Isle-auxCoudres, Quebec. The following familial traits were analyzed: parenta}) consanguinity, maternal
and paternal age at time of childbirth, sex, birth order, the interval since the previous birth, month
of birth, viability of the preceding infant, the number of deceased family members in the age groups
0-1, 1-4 and more than §$ years at the time of the child’s birth. A multiple discriminant analysis has
been worked out first on a birth cohort (1880-99) with no underreporting of infant mortality (Stage
1). Subsequently, four other cohorts were analyzed in the same way (Stage 2). Stage 1 analysis opposes the two extremities of the life span to the age group 5-69 years, and points to maternal age,
among other Jess important variables, as a factor of offspring early (less than 5) or advanced age
(over 70) at time of death. Stage 2 analysis shows inconsistencies with Stage 1 results. Taking account of family size, further investigations supported the view that offspring survival to either early
or advanced age could vary from family to family.

sidual sample. Quebec civil records,
though not relieving the possible bias due
to sample attrition, may however become
a valid alternative in the undertaking of
historic follow-up studies in human
biology (Philippe, 1975). Actually, parish
records reporting births, marriages, and
deaths were investigated since colonization of the country, and the families reconstructed with the aid of informatic devices
for any period of time. This task was undertaken for seven Frer.ch Canadian populations in 1967. Details of data management were published elsewhere (Gomila
and Guyon, 1969). Several studies of data
collected in the one population of Isleaux-Coudres, colonized in 1728, were reported previously. All have benefited
from a historical prospective approach.

Besides possible historical follow-up of
demographic events occurring to families,
comparative analysis of several birth cohorts may overcome to a certain extent the
effect due to migration. In this study, an
attempt is made to compare the results obtained in different subsamples of the Isleaux-Coudres population (two stages
analysis) in the hope to sort out the biological factors conveyed by the demographic
variables associated with differential survival.

In addition to the age at death, expressed in complete months, each individual has been characterized by the following familial characteristics: extent of
inbreeding’, age of the mother and father
at the time of the child’s birth, sex, birth
order, interval since previous birth,
month of birth, viability of the preceding
infant, the number of deceased sibs in the
age groups of 0 to 1, 1 to 4, and more than
5 years at the time of the child’s birth.
Each of these variables was broken down

into multiple categories converted in their
turn into binary variables in order to identify clearly the original variable categories
which might be related to a specific age at
death (shown in Table 3). The ten age
groups merged were then subjected to
multiple discriminant analysis (Seal,
1964). The latter permits the evaluation of
the variation of each age group on the basis of a linear combination of the binary
variables (26 in this study) and the
clarification of the influence of any familial correlates category to age at time of
death.

The resulting discriminant function ts
of the following form

Y=A,X, + A,X, + -- + A,X,

where the A’s are the discriminant
coefficients attached to each familial trait
category (X’s). The basic principle of the
discriminatory variable (Y) is to maximize
separation of age groups by increasing the
ratio of between—age-groups variance to
within-age-group variance.

The discriminant function coefficients
thus represent the exclusive contribution
of each familial trait category to age
groups at death, taking into account the
set of all intercorrelations. The order of
magnitude of the coefficient, account
taken of its sign, represents the greater or
lesser weight of the familial trait category
in relation to a specific age group at death.
It is the discriminatory power of the familial trait category. Once the discriminant
function is obtained, each individual
characterized by all of its familial coordinates is assigned an objective discriminant
value (Y) when processed through the discriminant function. A mean discriminant
variable (Y) is thus yielded for each age
group at death, the components of which
being the individual discriminatory variables derived from the original variables
hyperspace.

The present work is composed of two
stages. The first consists of performing a
discriminant analysis starting with the
1880-99 birth cohort. This particular cohort was chosen for two reasons. It contains the largest number of individuals
(N=298) and, most importantly, no infant death is missing. Assessment of underreporting has been worked out by
Henry’s method (1967) which consists in
comparing the distribution of time inter
vvals involving births followed by infant
Smortality with those of children of un‘known fate, taking into consideration the
sbreakdown of the intervals for children
Surviving past their first birthday. The
method is based on the principle that the
Sdistribution of the intervals which follow a
“case of infant mortality is clearly asymetri“cally positive in relation to a similar distribution among surviving children because

‘von previous cohorts, namely those of
1800-29, 1830-49, 1850-69, and 1870-79
Sin order to compare the above results to
pthose obtained in Stage 1 analysis. Stage 2
analysis is composed of cohorts of a lesser
shumber of births with a relatively high de
Ssree of underreporting as assessed by
gHenty’s method (1967).

RESULTS
STAGE 1: COHORT ANALYSIS, 1880-1899

We have formed a group of 298 people
out of a total of 721 who had died by December 31, 1974, for whom birth and
death records were available. Persons
who were not available are divided into
two groups: (a) those present in the population but for whom information of each
familial characteristic is not available and

Longevity: Some Familial Correlates

213

(b) emigrants, i.e., persons who died outside the population.

The ten age groups were not distinguishable by the 26 binary variables used.
The stepwise method was therefore employed (Nie et al., 1975) and the 15 most
contributing variables to group separation
were retained.

Table 1 shows that persons deceased
between 0 and 4 and between 70 and 89
years (positive signs) were similar and differed significantly (»<0.004) from persons who died between 5 and 69 (completed years) (negative signs). The size of
the discriminant means is important. Persons who died between 1 and 4 years and
between 70 and 79 years more closely resembled those who died between 5 and 69
years than elderly individuals, 80-89
years, and especially infants who died before their first birthday. Thus, extremities
of the life span both oppose the 5-69 age
group.

Given this, we went on with the two following comparative analyses: 0-5 years
versus 5-69 years as a single group, and
5-69 years versus 70 years or more in order to point out the variables responsible
for early or late death. Table 2 indicates

that increased maternal age is the main

factor common to both early or late death.
Less correlated with early death are

month of birth and high parity, along with
an elevated number of infant deaths
within the family. Similarly, advanced age
at death is feebly but significantly associated with the male sex and an increased
number of child deaths.

Since advanced maternal age stands for
the main discriminator of both extremities
of the life span and since not all the binary
variables were retained in the course of
the analyses, we felt justified in assembling into a single group the age groups
which resembled each other (0-4 and
70-89); this group was compared to the
group composed of those persons who
died between the ages of 5 and 69 years.
This procedure allowed us to determine the
overall contribution of all of the 26 variables to age at death. The two groups were
significantly different (p<0.006) on the
basis of the 26 binary variables due to less
heterogeneity between the groups. Table
3 provides the extent of the contribution
of the familial characteristics to survival.
Only the most important factors will be
underscored here.

Social Biology

The increasing age of the mother, especially after 35 years, increases the probability of both an early (0-4 years) and late
death (70-89 years) even though childhood
mortality at that time was largely due to
exogeneous factors (positive signs). The
father’s age, which exerts an influence
nearly equal to that of the mother, begins
to cancel the latter with advancing years
(negative signs). An interval of more than
22 months from the preceding birth is
characteristic of deaths occurring in the
age group 5-69 years. The numerical position of offspring in the family, the month
of birth, and the male sex are only weakly
correlated with early or late death as expected. Otherwise, numerous juvenile
deaths in the family is related to ego’s
death between 5 and 69 years of age.

STAGE 2: COHORT ANALYSIS, 1800-29,
1830-49, 1850-69, AND 1870-79

These cohorts have an infant mortality
underreporting rate on the order of 23 per
cent. Table 4 provides, for each of the
above cohorts, the sample size of each age
group, the mean discriminant variable for
each age group, and the significance of the
dissimilarity. No cohort demonstrated an
appreciable degree of significance when
analyses were concerned with ten age
groups and 26 variables. Furthermore, the
pattern of signs opposing both extremities
of the life span observed in the 1880-99 cohort does not appear as clearly as one
would wish. This, of course, may be
ascribed to the small size of the samples
and to poor discrimination among age
groups. _

Nevertheless, we obtained significant
dissimilarities with smaller subsets of variables. It was remarkable-that advanced
maternal age at birth remained the single
most important discriminator of very late
death (more than 70 years of age) except
for the 1830-49 births cohort. On the

regularity in the profile, very evident for
the period 1880-99, which lends a certain
credence to the observations. No doubt it
is easier, based on such small sample sizes,
to dismantle such a complex profile than
to construct it at random.

If one tries to construct the typical
profile of the two opposite age groups
here, it is seen that the familial characteristics of the average person is described
by a negative discriminant mean. These
people do not exhibit any particular susceptibility to either early or, in particular,
to a very late death. A positive profile
looks different: It conforms as much to a
child who died before one year of age as to
an elderly person over 80 years of age. Using a different method, an amazingly similar result was discovered by Lederman
and Breas (1959) and discussed later by
Bourgeois-Pichat (1963). Neither could
interpret the phenomenon.

No definite effect of very short time
lapse between conceptions could be
found. Intervals of at least 22 months between confinements, however, were correlated with an ordinary survival (5-69 age
group). On the other hand, it is likely that

an association does exist between multiple
juvenile deaths within families and
average survival due to exposure to common environmental agents.

The most important variables of the
setting up of the pattern of signs characteristic of the life span are undoubtedly
parental ages at birth of the offspring. The
similarity between high risk individuals
(early death) and those with unusually
long survival (more than 70 years) is supported, particularly if the mother is at an
advanced age at the child’s birth while the
father’s age is less. This fact gives support
to the well-known contention that an age
difference between spouses at birth of
child leads to increased infant mortality
(Newcombe et al., 1965; Spiers, 1972;
James, 1974a). Furthermore, Jalavisto
(1950) showed that a mother’s advanced
age (more than 40 years) at birth is positively correlated with the life expectancy
of the offspring until he reaches 50 years of
age. After 50 years of age, this trend
would seem to be reversed but on the basis
of an extrapolation of the trend. Some research suggests that the aging of the ovocytes would generally predispose a child to

Vol. 27, No. 3

an early death (Curtis, 1963). However,
the observed independent and opposite
effect of paternal age could otherwise insure the selection of only the strongest
sperm. The maternal age influence would
thereby be controlled in the latter zygotes.

We may perhaps consider that what we
generally call a “high risk constitution,”
which results in a positive score, also represents the make-up of individuals who
are likely to live longer than the average
(more than 70 years). This phenomenon is
not unknown among animals (Parsons,
1964). In an extensive review of the comparative biology of aging, Rockstein et al.
(1977) report that in the house fly and in
D. Pseudoobscura longer-lived males are
produced from older mothers. The
authors think that sex-limited genetic factors might be transmitted to the males
from longer-lived and presumably more
viable mothers (p. 8). The same has been
observed in inbred strains of mares. However, the case of rotifers is different in that
old mothers give birth to shorter-lived offspring and conversely. Following a somewhat similar line of evidence, our contention is that individuals from both extremes
of the life span have a constitution very
sensitive to harmful conditions, either exogenous (limited breast feeding) or particular genetic traits. Thus, it has recently
been shown that an elevated G-type immunoglobulin (Ig G) concentration but a
low M-type immunoglobulin (Ig M) constitutes the most characteristic factor of
persons who survive more than 70 years
(Buckley and Roseman, 1976).

It has been stated recently that the risks
of an early or late fetal death, neonatal
mortality, and most congenital malformations might not increase with the mother’s
age (Magaud and Henry, 1968; James,
1974b). The phenomenon could best be
explained by the increased fertility of high
risk mothers (James, 1976). Said another
way, the size of the family as related to the

Longevity: Some Familial Correlates

217

mother’s age would constitute a discriminant factor for mortality at an early age
(Krauss et al., 1972; Dott and Fort, 1975).
In order to examine this point further, we
have grouped families with at least ten
children and went on to a discriminant
analysis for three age groups, 0-4
(N=52), 5-69 (N=69), and = 70 (N=49)
for all cohorts simultaneously. For families of constant size, the family survival
traits were all homogenous (P=0.727).
Furthermore, no single variable contributed in differentiating the age groups. The
degree of significance confirms the homogeneity obtained when keeping family size
constant. Though this type of analysis with
its grouping of multiple generations must
be assessed cautiously, this new result suggests that the life expectancy of the offspring would neither increase nor decrease with the age of his parents at birth.
On one hand, this contradicts observations previously made in animals and, on
the other hand, our own results reported
hereabove. If the effect of family size is
real, two important conclusions may be
reached. First, the treatment of longitudinal observation varying during time with
a cross-sectional analysis may yield artifactual results. And second, the factual
observed variability in age at time of
death, presumably independent of all
familial correlates studied here, would
rather imply probabilities of survival varying greatly from family to family. Accordingly, differential survival of offspring
would be correlated to family size. AJthough this latter statement deserves to be
carefully evaluated, it could include observations already made though in a
neither systematic nor controlled fashion.
For instance, in several monographs
describing presumably long-lived individuals, large family size and advanced maternal age at child-bearing have been reported. Obviously, this statement does
not prove a causal relationship between

218 Philippe

differential survival and family size. At
best, it lends support to our suggestion.
Moreover, to claim a relationship. between a long life expectancy and birth in
families of high fertility can result in a
common factor, responsible simultaneously for high fertility and long term survival. This common factor, if of genetic
origin, would readily justify the variable
probabilities of survival from family to
family. It could involve, for example, a
variable frequency of susceptibility genes
to particular diseases (Abboit et al.,
1978). We may also be able to support the
concept of a variable antigenicity from
one mother to another or perhaps that of
variable immunologic response with age
from one female to another (Uphoff,
1973).

Ecological and behavioral factors cannot be ignored, however. It has been suggested that genetic variation in the age at

Social Biology

death is practically negligible (Philippe,
1976, 1977, 19785). Some types of infant
deaths would also appear to be independent of genetic factors (Spiers, 1974). On
the other hand, studies of animal survival
invoke diet and temperature as possible
agents of differential longevity (Rockstein
et al., 1977). Moreover, if differential fertility and survival may be linked to a common cause, it seems that differential reproduction has a bearing on the survival of
the human female (Philippe and Yelle,
1976). The variation in survival for early
as well as advanced ages may therefore depend on environmental conditions including our own internal milieu.
