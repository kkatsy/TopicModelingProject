Patterns and Variations in the Relationship
Between Infant Mortality and Socioeconomic Status

ABSTRACT: This study utilizes an ecological approach based on census tracts of residence to examine the relationship between infant mortality and socioeconomic status in metropolitan Ohio
at two points in time (1959-61 and 1969-71). The data presented clearly indicate that the infant
mortality rate continues to exhibit a pronounced inverse association with a wide variety of socioeconomic variables. Although there were some notable exceptions and/or variations from the
general patterns, a basic inverse relationship was generally found to be characteristic of both
neonatal and postnatal components of infant mortality, for both males and females, and for
both major exogenous and endogenous causes of death. Of all the variables examined, the one
factor that emerged as the strongest and most consistent determinant of census tract variations
in infant mortality was the proportion of low income families. Thus, the overriding conclusion
suggested by this study is that in spite of such things as continued advances in medicine and
public health, the expansion of a variety of social programs during the 1960’s, and the recent
resumption of a downward trend in the overall infant mortality rate, there has been little if any
progress in achieving more equitable life chances for the economically deprived segments of our
population.

was attributed to the fact that the majority of infant deaths occurred during the
neonatal period and were due to causes
related more to the physiological processes of gestation and birth rather than
socioeconomic factors. It was even suggested at this time that we could anticipate an even greater convergence of

slevel data (e.g., Shapiro et al., 1968;
‘ZShah and Abbey, 1971; Bendor et al.,
21971; MacMahon et al., 1972; GortmaSker, 1979) as well as studies using the
pMmore common ecological approach
s(¢. g., Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973; NaStional Academy of science, 1973; StockSwell and Laidlaw, 1977; Markides and
=Barnes, 1977; Adamchak and StockQwell, 1978; Adamchak, 1979; Brooks,
1975a, 1975b, 1978, 1980).

At the same time that research has
documented the persistence of an inverse differential, there is evidence that
a number of new patterns may have
emerged in recent years. For example,
although some studies suggest that there
is a fairly consistent linear gradient to
the relationship (Markides and Barnes,
1977; Davies, 1980), others have revealed a tendency for there to be some
convergence in infant mortality rates

among all but the lowest socioeconomic
groups (MacMahon et al., 1972; Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973; Antonovsky
and Bernstein, 1977). Another change
for which there is increasing evidence
concerns the growing importance of the
neonatal component of infant mortality
as a major contributor to the overall differential (Antonovsky and Bernstein,
1977; Thind et al., 1979; Adamchak,
1979); but here again there is conflicting
evidence (Markides and McFarland,
1982). Given the changes that have apparently occurred in the relationship
over the past generation, as well as the
persistence of some disagreements concerning the precise nature of the relationship, it is clear that this subject is
one that merits additional research.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
PURPOSE AND SCOPE

The primary objective of the research
reported on here is to measure and describe the associations between infant
mortality and socioeconomic status in
metropolitan Ohio (Dayton, Columbus, and Toledo) at two points in time
(1959-61 and 1969-71) in order to throw
additional light on the nature and extent
of the changes that are taking place in
the traditional inverse relationship. Attention is focused on the nature of the
relationship not only for total infant
mortality but also for its two major components (neonatal and postneonatal
mortality). Finally, an attempt is made
to assess the role played by particular
causes of death on the nature and magnitude of observed socioeconomic mortality differentials in infancy.

METHOD OF THE INVESTIGATION

The data for the study consisted of a
number of measures of the overall socio

economic characteristics of tract populations derived from the 1960 and 1970
decennial censuses and counts of the
number of live births in each census year
and the number of infant deaths during
the three years centered on the census
date. The basic relationship between the
major components of infant mortality
and various measures of socioeconomic
status was examined by means of an ecological approach in which the primary
unit of analysis was the census tract of
mother’s usual residence. Within this
general approach two different procedures were used to measure the basic relationship between infant mortality and
socioeconomic status. First, the nature
and magnitude of the relationship between the infant mortality rates of individual census tracts and their aggregate
socioeconomic characteristics, and
changes therein, was examined by
means of a simple correlation analysis.
In addition to providing initial answers
to some of the specific research questions, this correlation analysis, in conjunction with a factor analysis, also
served as the basis for selecting out
those socioeconomic variables to be
used in the second phase of the study—a
social area analysis that examined variations in infant mortality among groups
of census tracts that had been aggregated on the basis of their ranking on
particular socioeconomic variables.

RESULTS

To summarize in a very general way,
the data generated by this study clearly
indicated that the infant mortality rate
continues to exhibit a pronounced inverse association with a wide variety of
socioeconomic variables. Moreover, although there are some notable exceptions and variations, such an inverse pat

tern was generally found to be characteristic of both neonatal and postneonatal components of infant mortality, for
males and females, for both time periods examined, and for both major endogenous and exogenous causes of
death. More detailed comments on the
trends and patterns revealed by the
analysis are presented in the following
paragraphs.

CORRELATION ANALYSIS

The first step in the analysis was to
calculate a series of correlation matrices
showing the relationships among the
several dependent and independent varlables for all subgroups in the study. In
the interest of economy these data are
only partially presented here (see Table
1). However, these limited data are generally representative of the overall findings of the research: (a) There was a
very pronounced inverse association between infant mortality and the vast majority of the socioeconomic indicators in
both 1960 and 1970; and (b) the relationship characterized both neonatal and
postneonatal components of infant mortality, but was generally stronger for the
latter.

SocIAL AREA ANALYSIS

In the second phase of the analysis,
census tracts in the three cities were aggregated into five social areas on the basis of three separate socioeconomic
measures that a factor analysis identified
as tapping different dimensions of socioeconomic status: Low Income Families
(the percentage of families with incomes
below a specified level—$3,000 in 1960;
$5,000 in 1970); Working Mothers (per
cent of married women with own children under 6 who were in the labor
force); and Per cent Black. In each case,
the cut-off points were established in

(b) In 1970, a clear inverse relationship characterized all three socioeconomic measures. While the changed situation with respect to Working Mothers
supported the hypothesis advanced elsewhere concerning the emerging importance of such family status variables
(Adamchak and Stockwell, 1978), the
observed relationship was much weaker
than that characterizing either Low Income Families or Per cent Black.

(c) Incontrast to 1960, the pattern revealed in 1970 did not follow a consistent inverse gradient. Rather, it was one
in which the highest and lowest status
areas were sharply differentiated from
the middle three with respect to infant
mortality rates, while among the three
intermediate areas there was a clear tendency for the death rates to merge together.

(d) In all sections of this analysis it
was clear that Low Income Families was
the most consistent in revealing the existence of an inverse association between infant mortality and socioeconomic status.

family economic status has consistently
been identified as a major determinant
of infant mortality ever since the relationship was first examined (Woodbury,
1925), led to a decision to concentrate
on this measure as the major independent variable. The highlights of this
broader analysis may be summarized
briefly as follows:

(a) General Trends: The data presented in Table 3 clearly show that there
was a very strong and consistent inverse
association between infant mortality
(total, neonatal and postneonatal) and
the overall income status of residential
areas in Ohio in 1960. The basic inverse
pattern was seen to characterize both
males and females, but it was especially
pronounced and most consistent for the
former; and in all cases it clearly characterized both neonatal and postneonatal
mortality, although it was notably
stronger for the latter.

By 1970, although a basic inverse relationship was apparent, there was a
clear converging tendency among the
middle areas. The overall pattern for
both sexes with respect to the total infant and neonatal mortality was for
Areas I and V to be even more widely
separated than in 1960 in terms of low
and high death rates while the Area II,
III, and IV rates tended to converge
around those for All Areas. For
postneonatal mortality there continued
to be a generally consistent inverse gradient across all five social areas, with the
rates in Area V being three to five times
as great as corresponding rates observed
in Area I.

(b) Cause of Death Analysis: The
purpose of the cause of death analysis
was to see if the general inverse nature
of the relationship between infant mortality and socioeconomic status could be
explained largely in terms of a particular

=characterized all the major causes of infant death. Although it would have been
. Buesirable to examine specific causes, the
‘pfact that a marked reduction in the numSber of cases enhances the likelihood of
‘erate instability when specific causes are
oconsidered necessitated basing this analysis on a comparison of the role of endogenous aS opposed to exogenous
causes of death. The former causes,
those most closely associated with the
physiological processes of gestation and
birth, comprised the following specific
groups: congenital anomalies, birth injuries, postnatal asphyxiation, immaturity, and other diseases peculiar to early
infancy. The latter exogenous causes, or
those furthest removed from the actual
birth process and thus more likely to be

influenced by differences in social and
environmental conditions, included the
acute infectious and parasitic disease,
accidents, and a residual group comprising all other causes.

The general cause-specific infant
death rates for the two metropolitan aggregates included in this study are presented in Tables 4 and 5. A detailed examination of these data suggests that
two broad conclusions are clearly applicable. First, as would be expected, the
general pattern is one where endogenous causes are predominantly associated with neonatal mortality (e.g., 90
per cent or more of all neonatal deaths
were attributed to one or another of the
endogenous causes), whereas the exogenous causes are more commonly associated with postneonatal mortality,

*Rate based on Jess than 10 deaths

though to a somewhat lesser degree
than in the former instance (i.e., 70 per
cent or more of the postneonatal deaths
in Ohio were due to exogenous causes).
Second, it would appear that the general
patterns of the basic inverse relationship
between infant mortality and socioeconomic status described in the preceding
sections are characteristic of both endogenous and exogenous causes of
death—most especially of those segments of infant mortality to which each
is a major contributor. That is, in the
case of the former causes, levels of total
and neonatal mortality tend to vary inversely across income areas while the
postneonatal endogenous death rates
exhibit little or no discernible pattern in

their association with socioeconomic
status. Conversely, for the exogenous
cause group the total infant and
postneonatal mortality rates are inversely related to income status,
whereas the neonatal death rates tend to
vary in an erratic manner across the several social areas.

Overall then, although there are obvious numerous variations, and although there is some problem with
empty cells and the potential instability
of infant death rates, the data presented
in Tables 4 and 5 clearly indicate that the
basic inverse relationship between infant mortality and socioeconomic status
cannot be attributed solely (or even
largely) to either cause group. Although

DISCUSSION

The major findings and conclusions
of the research reported on here are
generally similar to those of a number of
other studies that have been carried out
in recent years, and they provide further
evidence in support of many of the conclusions reached by others pertaining
both to the persistence of a basic inverse

association between socioeconomic status and infant mortality and to the emergence of a number of different patterns
and/or changes within the general inverse relationship. Some of the more
important commonalities may be summarized briefly as follows:

(1) Persistence of Inverse Association: The present study confirms the
findings of other studies based on data
for the 1960’s and later (or during the
time when the infant mortality rate had
resumed its downward trend) that socioeconomic status continues to be an important determinant of levels of mortality in infancy. While there is some
evidence to support earlier hypotheses
pertaining to a convergence of social
class infant mortality rates during the

36 Stockwell and Wicks

late 1940’s and early 1950’s, the studies
undertaken since then clearly reaffirm
the existence of a marked inverse association between socioeconomic status and
infant mortality. Further, there is general agreement that despite the recent
emergence of a marked neonatal differential (see Section 3 below) the relationship continues to be most pronounced
for the postneonatal death rate.

(2) Blurring of the Association: Although it is clear that a basic inverse differential continues to characterize the
relationship between socioeconomic
status and infant mortality, there is also
a growing body of evidence from studies
based on a variety of methods and socioeconomic indexes to indicate that the
differential is no longer characterized by
a consistent pattern of linearity across
all socioeconomic groups. Rather, the
emerging pattern revealed by most of
the recent American studies is one in
which the lowest socioeconomic group
consistently experiences much higher
infant mortality rates than the general
population but in which there was essentially no difference among the upper sccial classes (Antonovsky, 1967; MacMahon et al., 1972; Kitagawa and Hauser,
1973; Antonovsky and Bernstein,
1977). The present study found a consistent inverse gradient in Ohio for the
1960 period, but by 1970 the association
had begun to blur. At that time the general pattern was one where the highest
and lowest social areas clearly stood out
as having the lowest and highest infant
mortality rates but where there was a
marked convergence around the mean
of the mortality rates in the three intermediate areas.

Overall then, it appears that there is
widespread agreement on the severe
mortality disadvantage characterizing
the lowest socioeconomic groups. Fur
 

Social Biology

ther, there is widespread support for the
conclusion that some kind of converging
trend is evident among the higher socioeconomic groups in the population.

(3) The Importance of Neonatal Mortality: The findings of the present study
also reveal the emerging importance of
neonatal mortality differentials as a contributor to the overall inverse association between socioeconomic status and
infant mortality. In sharp contrast to the
situation a generation ago, there is a
growing body of evidence to indicate
that the neonatal death rate appears to
be as much affected by socioeconomic
status as is the traditionally more sensitive postneonatal death rate (Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977; Thind et
al., 1979). The implication of this situation is clear: Any policies and/or programs that are drawn up for the purpose
of alleviating the adverse influence of a
low socioeconomic status on infant mortality must look both at those correlates
of a low status that directly impinge on
the well-being of the new born infant
(the quality of postnatal care, adequacy
of diet, quality of housing, sanitary status of the home environment, etc.) and
at those indirect influences that relate to
the health of the mother and operate
through her to influence pregnancy outcome (quality of prenatal care, age and
parity, eating, drinking, and smoking
habits, etc.) (Gortmaker, 1979).

(4) Definition of Socioeconomic Status: There has recently emerged a growing awareness of the problems posed by
the multidimensional nature of what is
loosely referred to by the term “‘socioeconomic status’? (Stockwell, 1966;
Brooks, 1975b; Adamchak, 1979). In
particular, a number of recent studies
have been concerned both with the fact
that the nature of the relationship between infant mortality and socioeco 

Vol. 31, No. 1-2

nomic status will vary depending upon
how the latter concept is operationalized, and with the fact that the nature of
the relationship between infant mortality and specific socioeconomic indicators has apparently changed over time—
and is changing even now. More
specifically, it has been hypothesized recently that what have been identified as
“family-status variables” (e.g., the pro_,portion of (a) female-headed families,
=(b) working mothers, or (c) disrupted
‘\marriages) may be as strongly related to
‘infant mortality levels as the more tradiStional socioeconomic variables (AdamAchak, 1979; Jones, 1980; Adamchak and
Flint, 1981). The results of the present
Sstudy lent only partial support to this hycopothesis. Although only partial data
shave been included in this paper, an ex‘gamination of several of these family staotus variables revealed that with one exOception they were either very highly

= correlated with the more traditional ec°Conomic variables, or they were not asso‘ciated in any identifiable way with levels
Sof infant mortality. The one exception,
‘Ethe percentage of married women with
—own children under six who were in the
5\abor force, was not related to infant
mortality in 1960 but did serve to differSentiate infant mortality levels in 1970.
EWhile the influence of such variables
4 does not appear to be as strong as that of
more traditional economic measures,
the fact that it has emerged at a time
when the structure of the American
family has undergone and is undergoing
some fairly radical changes strongly
points to the advisability of continuing
to monitor this trend.

Over and above the fact that some
variations do exist and that some
changes may indeed be emerging it is
eminently clear from the findings of the
vast majority of studies that infant mor
h

f

y

tality has consistently displayed a
marked inverse relationship to the income dimension of socioeconomic status. From the pioneer effort by Woodbury (1925), through the 1950’s and
1960’s when the association appeared to
be blurring, up to the present study,
family income has been and continues to
be a most potent determinant of the
level of mortality in infancy.

CONCLUSIONS

One of the truly outstanding achievements of the twentieth century has been
the remarkable progress that has been
made in death control. This progress has
been most keenly reflected in a profound reduction in the risk of dying during infancy, a reduction that is still taking place today. At the same time,
however, it is abundantly clear that the
fruits of this progress are not being
shared equally by all segments of the
population. The findings of the present
research, as well as those of a wide variety of studies dealing with this general
topic, have consistently shown that the
lower socioeconomic groups in our society have been and continue to be characterized by an extremely pronounced
disadvantage when it comes to infant
survival. The clear implication of this
observation is that, for whatever reason,
existing maternal and infant health care
knowledge and services are not reaching
these lower socioeconomic groups.

Much of the credit for the progress
we have made to date in reducing infant
mortality can be attributed to the sometimes dramatic advances made in medical care knowledge and technology; but
part of the credit must also be given to
the federal government, particularly to
those funded programs that have sought
to enhance the quantity, quality, and ac

cessibility of maternal and child health
educational and service programs.
There is an obvious need to maintain existing programs in order to hold on to
those gains that have been made. At the
same time there is an equally obvious
need for stepped up efforts to see that
these programs reach those economically disadvantaged members of the society that are most in need of them. In
an era when good health and access to
good health care is seen as a basic human right for all our citizens, rather than
an expensive privilege for those who can

afford it, the continued failure of the existing health care delivery system to penetrate fully through to the lowest economic classes poses a major challenge
for the society.
