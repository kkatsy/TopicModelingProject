ABSTRACT: For most people immigration to a new country such as Canada entails a positive
move and an improvement in life. The many challenges associated with resettlement may,
however, lead to insurmountable difficulties, stresses and conflict for a significant number of
newcomers. The mortality experience of immigrants, as reflected in cause-of-death statistics,
may provide indication of the extent of stress and conflict in their migration experience. This
situation is most clearly exhibited in mortality from suicide, homicide, and motor vehicle
accidents. In this study, hypotheses concerning immigrant mortality in Canada are developed
and tested with a log-linear model for rates pertaining to rare events. Overall, the results give
support for the importance of country-of-origin effects in explaining suicide propensities, but not
for homicide and motor vehicle accidents mortality. Income discrepancies are a significant
determinant of variability in death rates overall, but discrepancies between the immigrants in this
study and the Canadian-born are not of much significance. The strongest net effect on the
cause-specific death rate is associated with group membership. This effect likely reflects a
number of residual unmeasured sources of variation including the influence of the immigrant
ethnic community as a source of social support, and the potential confounding effects of
migration selectivity.

factor that may predispose present behavior in the host nation. The latter, as
a significant component of socialization, may be an important factor in
predisposing immigrant behavior in
the new society.
The empirical analysis in this study
is based on the assumption that immigrant behavior, and hence the likelihood of violent and accidental mortalwity, is partly determined by one’s

BACKGROUND

Prior to the second World War,
> most foreign-born groups in the United
"2 States possessed higher overall mortalSity rates than the American-born popS ulation, especially in the case of exter‘nal causes of death such as suicide,
Shomicide, and accidents (Dublin and
3 Baker, 1920; Dublin, 1933; Dublin et
Zal., 1949; Jacobson, 1963). In recent
= decades this situation seems to have reA versed, with foreigners generally showing lower rates of mortality (Kestenbaum, 1986). The reasons for this
reversal have not been explored in any
systematic way, but Kestenbaum

of Michigan

(1986) speculates that recent immigrants’ improved socioeconomic status
is responsible for this change. The
study of Kitagawa and Hauser (1973)
demonstrates that by the early 1960's,
there was virtually no difference between the mortality rates of the

Violent and Accidental Mortality 83

foreign-born and the American-born.
Jacobson (1963) showed that by 1960
there was a convergence in overall
mortality; and in the case of deaths due
to accidents and violence, foreigners
had only a very slight disadvantage.

In Australia, most immigrant
groups tend to enjoy lower overall
death rates than residents of both their
countries of origin and destination
(Young, 1987). Concerning suicide,
migrant rates tend to surpass both
those of Australia and their respective
countries of origin, but they are more
akin to those of their home countries
than to their receiving society (Sainsbury and Barraclough, 1968; Burwill et
al., 1973, 1982). Such evidence has
been interpreted to denote that immigrant death rates are largely determined by cultural factors associated
with their country of origin. For example, national religion and group differences in values of familism and traditionalism brought from the homeland,
may serve to either increase or reduce
anomie in the new country (Burwill et
al., 1973).

The influence of background culture
on mortality risk may be an inverse
function of duration of residence in the
host society. In accordance with assimilation theory, one would expect that
the longer immigrants reside in their
host nation, the greater the erosion of
their background culture and hence a
convergence in mortality rates with
those of the host society. This hypothesis was not supported by Burwill and
associates (1982). They established a
weak relationship between length of
residency in Australia and the tendency for immigrants to adopt the predominant suicide methods of the
Austrafian-born, but no association

84

was detected between length of residency and suicide rates.

As is the case in Australia, many immigrant groups in Canada seem to exhibit suicide rates that are closer in
level to their countries of origin than to
their receiving society. Kliewer and
Ward (1988) attempted to ascertain
whether migrant suicide propensities
converge with those of the Canadianborn. In 40 per cent of the cases (out of
a total of 25 immigrant groups), there
was, indeed, indirect evidence of convergence.

Trovato and Jarvis (1986) observed
that, in Canada, foreigners from predominantly Southern European origins
and a Catholic religious culture (such
as Italians and Portuguese) tend to
share very low odds of suicide, whereas
immigrants that are predominantly
Protestant and Anglo-Saxon in origin
tend to demonstrate an above average
risk of suicide (e.g., American, German, and Scottish immigrants).

Whitlock (1971) made a similar discovery in Australia. The British, the
Irish, and the New Zealanders share a
common Anglo-Saxon culture with the
Australian-born. They also display
higher odds of self-inflicted death in
comparison to residents of their countries of origin and destination. In contrast, Southern Europeans typically
enjoy lower rates of suicide than residents of both origin and destination
countries. Whitlock (1971) interpreted
these patterns of differences as providing support for the hypothesis that immigrant suicide rates are determined
by tradition and social attitude toward
the act of suicide. In general, Catholic
countries share strong moral proscriptions against suicide and their levels of
self-murder are typically low (Durk
Trovato

 

Social Biology

heim, 1951; Kushner, 1984). It is not
surprising, therefore, that immigrants
from Catholic countries exhibit relatively low odds of death from suicide.
This fact probably explains, to a large
extent, the consistently low rates of
suicide among Italians and other
Southern Europeans in host countries
such as Australia, France, the United
States, and Canada.

Homicide and motor vehicle fatalities are symptomatic of difficulties and
conflict in the life of the individual
(Gove, 1973). Information about migrants’ pattern of death from these
causes iS scant, but the available evidence suggests that rates of homicide
and accidental related death are quite
high among foreigners in Australia
(Burwill et al., 1973), in France (Brahimi, 1980), and in England and Wales
(Marmot et al., 1984).

Burwill and colleagues (1973) discovered that migrant death rates from
motor vehicle accidents are higher than
those in the Australian-born in virtually all age groups. Unlike suicide, migrant death rates from traffic accidents
tend to be closer to the Australtanborn levels than to those prevailing in
their home countries. In general,
groups with high suicide rates also
share high rates of mortality from motor vehicle accidents and other forms
of violence, suggesting that perhaps violent and accidental mortality may be a
function of some underlying common
factor.

The situation in France provides
further indication that immigrants tend
to die more from violent causes such as
homicide and from road accidents in
comparison to the receiving population
(Brahimi, 1980). An interesting observation is that the more recent immi
 
 

Vol. 39, No. 1-2

grant groups tend to show higher rates
of road accidents mortality than the
more established groups. This finding
may indicate adjustment problems for
newcomers, an excessive use of alcohol, and difficulty in internalizing traffic rules prevailing in the host nation.

Concerning immigrants’ increased
odds of homicide mortality, Burwill et
al. (1973) proposed that murder is a
form of aggression carried over from

e migrant’s culture of origin—a view
@nsistent with Wolfgang and Ferracuf’s (1967) culture-of-violence theory,
which proposes that the tendency for
Qutward aggression is a learned behavYor (see also Hackney, 1969; Gastil,
4971; Loftin and Hill, 1974).

"~ Some criminologists have applied

is perspective to analyze differences
i homicide rates among nations, since
4 the national level, homicide victimsation rates reflect a society’s overall
tendencies for lethal violence. For example, Gartner (1990) tested a model
6f cross-national and temporal variafions in homicide rates using sex-age
wictimization data for 1950-80. She
found support for the prediction that
Bomicide levels are higher in societies
Where the death penaity is legally sancHoned and where involvement in wars

as been more frequent and more
Geadly.

Gartner’s study is based partly on
the importance of socialization in explaining violent behavior and on the
modeling-habituation principle—that
the more one is exposed to a particular
behavior (e.g., violence), the more
likely are individuals to execute the action themselves under certain conditions (Bandura, 1973). Thus, the
culture-of-violence explanation  as
sumes that differences in homicide re
 

Violent and Accidental Mortality 85

flect “‘an underlying system of norms
prescribing, or failing to prescribe, violence as a response to conflict” (Gartner, 1990, p. 96).

Williams and Flewelling (1989) provide additional support for this thesis.
They included indicators of ‘violent
cultural orientation” in their model of
criminal homicide in American cities.
It was found that cultura) orientation is
indeed an important predictor of homicides that result from interpersonal
conflicts, even after the effects of resource deprivation and social disorganization variables were held constant.

Why do certain immigrant groups
experience greater levels of homicide
victimization than others? While there
is overwhelming evidence in the
United States and Canada that the majority of homicides occur intraracially
(Kennedy and Forde, 1990; O’Brien,
1987), the facts are less certain with regard to immigrants (Nettler, 1982). In
Canada there is no empirical information as to whether homicide victimization among immigrants is a predominantly intragroup phenomenon as
opposed to an intergroup one. Analysts have reported that approximately
78 per cent of all homicide victims in
this country share close relational ties
with their assailants (Silverman and
Kennedy, 1987).

While this evidence says nothing
about intergroup violence among immigrants, it may be interpreted to suggest that perhaps most immigrant homicides in Canada involve persons of
the same group. To the extent that this
is a true reflection of reality, a group’s
observed level of homicide victimization may be taken as a reflection of violent aggression toward other members of the same group. Ideally,

86 Trovato

information on the country of birth of
both assailant and homicide victim
would be required to determine the veracity of this assumption in a systematic manner. Official homicide statistics in Canada do not record country of
birth of both the victim and the assailant. Therefore, it is impossible to give
a direct answer to the question concerning the nationality of murderer
and victim (Kennedy et al., 1989).

An explanation of variability in homicide victimization rates among immigrants must consider the influence of
economic inequality because analysts
have shown that it is directly associated
with homicide rates (Gartner, 1990;
Messner, 1982, 1989; Williams, 1984;
Williams and Flewelling, 1988; Cohen
et al., 1981; Shaw and McKay, 1942;
Fiala and LaFree, 1988; Sampson and
Groves, 1989). The underlying mechanism in this relationship involves economic inequality as a cause of alienation, despair and pent up aggression
often resulting in personal conflict and
criminal violence (Gartner, 1990).
Therefore, among immigrants the relationship between economic inequality and homicide mortality should be
positive.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The mortality experience of immigrants in host nations can be understood in terms of four sets of factors:
(1) culture-of-origin effects; (2) factors
in the country of destination; (3) personal characteristics; and (4) migration
selectivity effects (i.e., selection at the
point of origin, and selection in the

 

Social Biology

propensity to return to one’s country of
origin).

It is known that different cultures
share particular orientations with regard to suicide and death. According
to Aries (1974, 1982, 1985) death is a
central aspect of collective identity, reflected in a society’s images and representations of it, such as in art, burial
rituals, and tombs. Kushner (1984), a
psychohistorian, has elaborated on this
idea. He has argued that immigrant
differentials in suicide reflect variability in national culture pertaining to
rituals of bereavement and its relationship to an unconscious motive for
self-punishment. In societies where exaggerated mourning is an accepted part
of the culture, Catholicism tends to be
the dominant religion, and suicide
rates are low (e.g., Southern Europe).
It is thought that the cathartic effect of
expressive mourning alleviates the unconscious tendency for self-punishment when a loved one is lost. Countries that do not generally possess such
rituals tend to show increased rates of
suicide, presumably due to the individual not having access to an outward expression of guilt when a loved one has
died.

One other important source of a nation’s cultural orientation to suicide ts
its moral judgments embodied in its
national religion. Thus, Catholic countries show lower suicide rates than
Protestant ones because Catholicism
has viewed suicide as a sin. Individuals
socialized in such regions of the world
are less likely to commit suicide, even
in the presence of extreme psychological distress. It may be that Catholicism
and exaggerated mourning rituals are
inseparable components of Southern
 

 

Vol. 39, No. 1-2

European culture and that both contribute to the consistently low suicide
propensities of Southern Europeans in
host countries.

National culture can be an important factor in the explanation of homicide differentials (Gartner, 1990). Immigrants in a society undoubtedly
possess orientations for conflict management and outward aggression
vearned in their home land. Therefore,
Homicide rates of migrants in their host
Dation may vary depending on their naonal origin.

9 Conditions in the country of destiation may also have an influence on
¢mmigrant mortality. Migration can ofYen be a very stressful process due to an
‘ndividual’ S severing of ties with his
fiomeland and significant others. Many
§nmigrants must overcome language
‘Barriers and learn the expectations of

e new society. For many, this process

f resocialization is a continuous one,
but it is perhaps more stressful for per‘ons whose culture of origin differs sigBificantly from that of the receiving
Sountry. A number of studies provide
gyidence that may be indicative of im‘migrants’ difficulties in adjusting to a
Hew society. Foreigners tend to suffer
fiicreased rates of psychiatric illness,

istress, and mental hospital admisfons (Kasl and Berkman, 1985; Hull,
1979; Mirowsky and Ross, 1980; King
and Locke, 1987; London, 1986; Krupinski, 1967; Odegard, 1932, Berry et
al., 1987; Vega, 1987; Locke and Duval, 1964). The stresses associated with
the migration experience may culminate in increased odds of suicide and
accidental or violent death (Rosenwaike, 1987, 1983; Rosenwaike and
Shai, 1989; Shai and Rosenwaike,

 

Violent and Accidental Mortality 87

1988). We expect that the stresses of
the immigration experience are conditioned by a group’s level of socioeconomic wellbeing in the host nation.
The higher the level of economic wellbeing, the lower the degree of stress
and the lower the chances of suicide,
homicide, and accidents leading to
death.

A third component that is important
in explaining immigrant mortality differentials pertains to the effects of individuals’ background characteristics.
Age, sex, and marital status are three
variables that are known to be significantly associated with mortality risk.
Accidental or violent death occurs
most frequently among young people
who are male and single (Gove, 1973).
Therefore, these three variables are introduced as important controls in this
analysis.

Observed differences in mortality
may be also a function of selection effects. For any given immigrant group,
a number of its members usually return
to their homeland; therefore, persons
who remain in the host country may
not be totally representative of all migrants belonging to the group. This situation may be a source of bias when
analyzing mortality differentials. If return migrants consist predominantly of
individuals who experience difficulties
in coping with the new society, observed differences across groups will be
affected. For example, the observed
risk for groups whose most stressed
members have returned home would
tend to be lower than it might have
been otherwise because the remaining
members would represent the most resilient and robust segment of the
group. Unfortunately, it is impossible

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

88 Trovato

to control for the effects of return migration, as it would require access to
information on persons who leave the
host country and on where they resettle, in addition to the ascertainment of
their mortality experience outside
Canada. Therefore, this study is necessarily confined to the mortality experience of immigrants who have remained in Canada.

Selection may also occur at the point
of origin. Persons who leave their
homeland for a new destination may
not be representative of the sending
population. To the degree that this is a
significant phenomenon, the mortality
risk of migrants in host nations will differ significantly from that of their nation of origin. If the migrants are somehow a “superior” (e.g., they possess
better genetic, constitutional, and social demographic predispositions than
the resident origin population) segment of the sending population, they
will probably have lower death rates
than residents of the home country.
Unfortunately, the potential biases in
the analysis of migrant death rates in
host countries generated by the selective nature of migration at the point of
origin cannot be measured unless special data sets are developed based on
individual level information. The
present study is based on vital statistics
data and cannot control for this possible source of variation. However, since
our main objective does not involve a
comparison of the immigrants’ death
rates to their countries of origin, this
source of selectivity effects is of secondary importance to this study (see
Table 1 for an indication of how migrant death rates compare to their
countries of origin and Canada).

HYPOTHESES

From the relevant literature and the
framework suggested, the following
hypotheses are proposed:

H1: The independent effect of country
of origin on immigrant mortality
due to suicide and homicide will be
positive;

H2: The higher the relative income of
immigrants, the lower the death
rate from suicide, homicide, and
motor vehicle accidental death;

H3: Immigrant differentials in suicide,

homicide, and motor vehicle accidental death rates will persist even
after the effects of income, country
of origin, and social demographic
characteristics have been statistically controlled.

The first prediction is based on the
premise that if there is a culture-oforigin effect on immigrant death rates,
then the higher the level of a given
cause of death in the immigrants’ country of origin, the higher should be the
corresponding rate among the immigrants in the host country. This expectation assumes that mortality from accidents, suicide, and violence of
immigrants and their respective origin
populations are partly determined by
their common culture learned through
socialization. In other words, the same
set of predisposing factors (i.e., culture) to commit suicide or homicide
are assumed to prevail in both origin
and corresponding migrant populations. We assume that motor vehicle
fatalities and other accidents among
immigrants have no link to culture of
origin, but are predominantly the result of conditions prevailing in the environment of action of individuals in
the host country. For example, motor

vehicle fatalities may occur to immigrants because they may have problems understanding the rules of the
road and/or problems in coping with
stress in their lives (e.g., excessive use
of alcohol). Other accidents can be a
function of work-related conditions
such as problems in fully understanding the operation of mechanical equipment and safety procedures.

Hypothesis number two is grounded
in the literature concerning the effects
of income inequality on suicide and homicide and mortality in general. The
relationship between measures of economic position and mortality is known
to be generally inverse (Antonovsky,
1967; Kitagawa, 1977; Kitagawa and
Hauser, 1973; Duleep, 1989). This relationship should also apply in the case
of immigrants.

The third hypothesis derives in part
from the discussion posed earlier concerning the potential influence of return migration selectivity. Any remaining variance in death rates after other
variables have been introduced into a
multivariate analysis would probably
reflect differences due to selectivity.
Another potential unmeasured source
of variability is group differences in
ethnic community integration. The
criminology literature indicates that
more socially integrated communities
tend to experience relatively low rates
of crime and homicide (Shaw and
McKay, 1942; Sampson and Groves,
1989; Gartner, 1990). Similarly, it is
likely that the incidence of suicide, homicide, and accidental deaths will be
less frequent in socially integrated immigrant ethnic communities. Communities that are characterized by strong
social network density exert greater
levels of control on the activities of

 

Social Biology

their members (Breton, 1964; Reitz,
1980; Pescosolido and Georgianna,
1989; Litwak and Messeri, 1989; Moen
et al., 1989; Lin and Ensel, 1989) and
provide more help to individuals in extreme distress that might result in suicide, homicide, or fatal accidents.

Since we do not possess direct measures for the effects of community integration and migration selectivity, it is
likely that in a multivariate analysis an
independent effect of immigrant group
membership would reflect these unmeasured sources of variation. Moreover, we surmise that the residual variance in the group variable is more
likely to be a reflection of ethnic community effects for relatively recent immigrant groups that are culturally dissimilar to the host country, as such
groups share a particular need to develop a highly cohesive community in
order to better cope with the contingencies of living in a new society.

For immigrant groups that are culturally similar to the host society, the
necessity to establish and maintain an
ethnic community is significantly less
important, as they are fully cognizant
of the language, the culture, and other
key aspects of the host nation. In a
multivariate analysis, a significant effect of group membership for such
groups is more likely to reflect return
migration selectivity effects rather than
ethnic community influences on mortality.

DATA AND Groups STUDIED

The data for this study were obtained from three different sources for
the period 1970-72. Deaths for immigrants and the Canadian-born were
taken from the Mortality Data Base at

Statistics Canada. The denominators
for the computation of rates (the base
populations) were compiled from the
1971 complete counts census tapes.
Appropriate mortality and population
data for the migrants’ countries of origin were taken from World Health Organization publications (World Health
Organization, 1971, 1972) and from
the United Nations Demographic
‘Wearbook (1971, 1972, 1973). The

Four immigrant groups are studied:

Darroch and Marston, 1984). The
other three classes of migrants are predominantly of Anglo-Saxon origin and
are not greatly different in culture from
the Canadian society. On the basis of
this similarity, we anticipate that these
groups would not differ significantly in
their mortality risk from the Canadianborn.

Violent and Accidental Mortality 91

The data set contains aggregate information on immigrants, their countries of origin, and the Canadian-born.
It is a large multiway tabulation of
deaths and corresponding population
counts cross-classified by cause of
death (suicide, ICD codes E950-E959;
homicide, ICD codes E960-E969;
motor vehicle accidents, ICD codes
E810-E825, E929; other accidents and
violence, ICD codes E800-E809,
E826-E928, E930-E999), age (15-29,
30-39, 40~49, 50-59, 60-69, 70+),
sex (male, female), marital status (single, married, other) and immigrant
group membership (Canadian-born,
American, English, Scottish, Italian,
Other Foreign-born, Missing Nationality).! This file also includes appropriately cross-classified information on
family income for the immigrants and
the Canadian-born, taken from the
1971 census. This variable is used as a
measure of economic inequality.

It is important to recognize the ecological nature of this measure and of
the study itself. Although the data
were taken originally from individual
vital statistics and census records, they
are treated in an aggregate fashion;
that is, the unit of analysis is the age/
sex/marital-status specific grouping for
each immigrant class. Due to the limited information on the death records,
this is as refined a cross-classification as

'During the period under observation there
were 40,116 deaths due to surcide, homicide, motor
vehicle accidents, and other acctdents—violence
Out of this total, 1,197 (2 98 per cent) were classified as ‘‘missing nationality” because the death
records do not contamn the country of birth of decedents The total number of deaths by cause are
Suicide (7,566), Homicide (1,232), Motor Vehicle
Accidents (14,942), Other Accidents—Violence

can be actualized, and the level of aggregation cannot be reduced any lower
unless one carries out a record linkage
of census and vital statistics individual
records.

In connection with the income measure, we make the assumption that income reported in the census by age,
sex, and marital status for each immigrant group is the same as the income
for the decedents within each immigrant class. It is well known that there
is an income (social class) gradient (inverse) in mortality. Hence, persons
who are deceased may have had radically different incomes than those who
are alive at the time of the census. Nevertheless, since our main interest is in
explaining between-group differentials
in mortality, this procedure is adequate
in capturing group discrepancies in income.

OPERATIONALIZATION OF HYPOTHESES

The hypotheses delineated earlier
are evaluated with the use of methods
appropriate for modelling rare events.
Since the dependent variables are dichotomies (dead vs. alive), they can be
treated as rates and may be analyzed
with log-linear methods (Clogg and
Eliason, 1988). The exponential property of the Poisson distribution permits
modelling such rare events by making
use of the log-link, of which the natural
logarithm is its natural parameter
(Agresti, 1990; Clogg and Eliason,
1987; Feller, 1968; Laird and Olivier,
1981). Our specification of the causespecific death rate incorporates an explicit standardization for differences in
age composition, as suggested by
Clogg and Eliason (1988, p. 271). The
left side of the following equation is the
age-sex standardized death rate, while

Violent and Accidental Mortality 93

The highest risks of suicide and homicide are evident for males, persons
aged 30-39, and for the single marital
status. In the case of accidental deaths,
the age group 15-29 has the highest
risk. In general, the residual class of
nativity (OFB) displays the largest risk
of death for each cause, while Italians
show the lowest odds. The main effects
of country of origin are statistically significant only in connection with suicide. Concerning the net effect of income, it is significant in three out of
four equations.

Our first hypothesis calls for suicide
and homicide propensities to be directly linked to immigrants’ corresponding country of origin. The evidence provides partial support for this
prediction, as this effect is statistically
significant only in the case of suicide; in
all other cases, country of origin is irrelevant in explaining mortality differentials.

This effect on suicide is substantial,
indicating that persons from world areas possessing relatively high suicide
propensities are three-and-a-half times
more susceptible to committing selfmurder in their adopted land
(odds = exp 1.2632 = 3.54), than are

where P,,* = estimated exposures for “missing”
nationality deaths by age, sex, and marital status,
P,, = known population counts by age, sex, marital
status and nationality, D,, = known deaths by age,
sex, marital status, and nationality Using this approximation as the denominator for the “missing”
will necessarily lead to relatively low mortality rates
for this group This fact does not pose a problem
since the aim 1s explicitly to take into account the
possible confounding effects of “missing” cases on
the “known” group-specific death rates, and in the
statistical analysis group contrasts do not involve the
parameter for “‘missing”’ nationality This approach
is more satisfactory than other commonly used
methods in similar situations For example, apportioning the missing cases on the basis of the known
distributton of deaths assumes the distribution of
mussing cases 1s the same as the known cases _ which
is an untenable assumption

persons originating from countries
with low rates of suicide. Of the four
groups, the Italians come from a region
characterized by low suicide propensities (Italy’s rate in 1971 = 7.27 per
100,000 population) while the Americans come from a country that possesses a relatively high suicide risk
(USA’s rate in 1970 = 16.10). The English and the Scottish are from nations
with moderate suicide levels intermediate to these two countries (9.49 and
9.04, respectively).

Notwithstanding these facts, the independent influence of group membership on suicide is insignificant for
American, English, and Scottish-born
immigrants. That is, once age, sex,
marital status, country-of-origin effects, and income discrepancies are
taken into account, the observed suicide differentials between each of these
groups and the Canadian-born become
insignificant (see Column [2]).

For Italian immigrants the situation
is quite different. They exhibit a significant main effect of group membership even after all relevant variables
are controlled (see Column [2]). Their
suicide changes are significantly lower
than those of the Canadian-born
(—1.1264). This result may be interpreted in terms of this group’s high degree of ethnic community integration,
its predominantly Catholic-ethnic subculture with strong proscriptions about
suicide, and its high density of community network ties that serve to “‘shelter’ or protect its members from committing suicide during difficult times.

Overall, the main effect of income
on suicide is negative. However, in
comparison to the Canadian-born, the
group-income interaction effects indicate that gains in family income lead to

Social Biology

significantly lower suicide chances only
for the English. It is worth noting that
the interaction effects across all groups
are rather small in magnitude, suggesting that income disparities are not of
major importance in the explanation of
suicide differentials between the immigrants and the Canadian-born.

Concerning homicide, the pattern
of effects with regard to age, sex, marital status, income, and nationality is
quite similar to that noted for suicide,
with the exception that the country of
origin factor is negative and is statistically unimportant. Thus, there appears
to be no evidence for a culture of violence effect on homicide, as operationalized in this study.

The main effect of income on homicide victimization is inverse. The interaction terms involving this variable
with nativity are also negative (except
for the “‘missing”’ nationality), but only
the English term is statistically significant. Therefore, as is the case with sutcide, discrepancies in income between
immigrants and the Canadian-born appear to be of limited relevance in explaining differences in the odds of dying from murder.

The group effects, expressed as differences form the Canadian-born (Column [2]), indicate that all four groups
share a reduced risk of homicide mortality. The largest advantage is for the
Italians (—0.8741) and for the English
(—0.7404), respectively. The contrasts
for the Americans and the Scottish are
not statistically significant.

As mentioned earlier in the case of
suicide, this result for the Italians may
be explained from the point of view of
their high degree of ethnic community
integration and social controls serving
to minimize homicide propensities.

The outcome for the English is less
straightforward, as they are not known
to possess a particularly distinct ethnic
community in the same way as do Italians and other Southern European
groups in Canada. The English, being
a dominant component of Canadian
society, have less need to establish a
visibly distinct ethnic community.
There must be some other factor, or
‘sets of factors, that are of particular
aelevance in explaining the relatively
low homicide death rate of this group.
5 Selectivity due to return migration
Ray account for this result. During the
arly seventies, return migration for

ersons Originating from the British
tsles was quite prevalent. Britain was
one of the leading “‘sending”’ nations to
€anada. From this fact it can be inferred that many of the British-origin
tmmigrants returned to their home
‘ountry, because, in general, the larger
the migration flow to a given destinaton, the higher is the volume of return
fhigration (Lee, 1966). Italians were
also a leading immigrant group during
this period, but generally, their likelihood of returning to Italy was minimal
BS compared to the English because
conomic conditions in the home counfty were not favorable to such a move
fe.g., the Italian economy was not
(Srosperous); and by and large, the majority of Italians came to Canada with
the intention of permanent settlement.
It is likely, then, that the net effect of
group membership for the English is
indicative of selectivity effects due to
return migration. That is, members of
this group who were dissatisfied and
stressed with conditions in Canada returned to their homeland, leaving their
more satisfied and adaptable members
in Canada, who consequently experi

enced relatively low levels of homicide.

Concerning motor vehicle accidents, the country of origin factor is
Statistically insignificant. The main effect of relative income is inverse and
significant, and the interaction of income with nationality is largely unimportant (except for the English). However, group-income interaction effects
in relation to “other accidents and violence”’ are statistically significant for
all migrant groups and are in the expected direction. That is, the higher
the relative income level, the lower the
death rate.

The main effects of immigrant
group membership for these two
causes of death (shown in Column [2])
are generally similar to those observed
earlier for suicide and homicide in that
only the Italians possess significantly
lower risks in relation to the Canadianborn.

CONCLUSIONS

The role of several factors concerning immigrant differentials in violent
and accidental mortality among four
groups in Canada are explored in this
study. It was found that the risk of dying from suicide is conditioned by the
demographic variables of age, sex, and
marital status, income discrepancies,
and country of origin. In the case of
homicide these same predictors are
also important with the exception that
country of origin is insignificant. With
respect to motor vehicle fatalities and
“other accidents-violence” it was
found that country of origin is of no
substantive importance.

The results for suicide are consistent
with the culture-of-origin explanation
proposed in this study. For homicide,

98 Trovato

we had expected that, in accordance
with the culture-of-violence theory in
criminology, country of origin would
be an important determinant of homicide differentials. No support for this
proposition emerged in this analysis.
Further work is needed to verify the
possible relevance of the culture-ofviolence theory in connection with immigrant homicide. Better measures of
a nation’s orientation toward aggression and violence are necessary to ascertain with greater certainty how this
influence may be transmitted to its departing members residing in foreign
lands.

Motor vehicle fatalities and other
forms of accidents and violence are not
related to the country-of-origin factor,
supporting the thesis that these causes
of death may be largely a function of
situational factors encountered by immigrants in the host country and have
nothing to do with one’s culture of origin.

Beyond age, sex, and marital status,
the strongest effect on immigrant mortality rates in Canada is associated with
immigrant group membership. This
variable captures residual variation not
accounted for by the other terms included in the multivariate analysis. It
was proposed that the net effect of this
variable on death rates partly reflects
group differences in ethnic community
integration and selectivity (i.e., due to
return migration). Only Italians and
English immigrants displayed significant net group effects—the former in
connection with all four causes of
death, the latter only in connection
with homicide. The consistency of this
result for the Italians suggests that
there may be a powerful underlying influence of community integration serv

ing to minimize the risk of violent and
accidental death for its members. This
finding conforms to migrant studies
conducted in other parts of the world
which show that Italians exhibit relatively low odds of violent and accidental mortality in comparison to their
host countries and in relation to other
immigrant groups in general (Trovato
and Jarvis, 1986; Kliewer and Ward,
1988; Whitlock, 1971; Burwill et al.,
1973, 1982; Young, 1987; Brahimi,
1980; Marmot et al., 1984).

This study differs from most others
in this area of research in that it includes into the statistical analysis a
measure of relative economic position
as an indicator of one key dimension of
conditions in the host nation, and an
explicit measure for country-of-origin
effects, a factor which has been given
much importance in the literature but
has seldom been measured explicitly.

In an earlier study, Trovato and
Jarvis (1986), found no statistical support for a country-of-origin effect on
immigrant suicide. The present study
finds a significant positive effect of this
factor. Two reasons for this difference
in results come to mind. First, the
present analysis is based on four
groups, while the earlier study included eight immigrant groups; and
secondly, the country-of-origin effect
in the present study is a more refined
operationalization than that employed
in the earlier investigation.

In future studies, it would be desirable to control for length of residency
in order to assess whether there is convergence in mortality risk with the host
population over time. Unfortunately,
in Canada this variable is not coded on
the death certificates. The use of age as
a control variable in this study can be

 
Vol. 39, No. 1-2

thought of as only a rough proxy for
duration of residence. In general, the
younger the age of decedents, the
shorter the interval between the time
of entry into Canada and the time of
death. In connection with homicide
differentials, it would be desirable to
include direct information concerning
the nationality of assailants. Given this
information, it would be possible to
windertake a more rigorous test of the
@ulture-of-violence theory, in that it
svould allow the researcher to ascertain

e degree to which homicide is an infragroup phenomenon as opposed to
fan intergroup one among immigrants.

future research. Further analysis 1s recSs
