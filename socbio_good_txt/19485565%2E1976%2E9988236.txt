Emotional Disturbance in Unplanned

Versus Planned Children

ABSTRACT: Two samples of unplanned and planned children, matched for education, were
compared for emotional disturbance on three different instruments. Unplanned children scored
consistently higher, in some cases significantly so, particularly among the lower classes. In the
second sample, mothers were also compared for neuroticism and for parental attitudes. Mothers
of unplanned children scored higher, but not significantly so. No differences in maternal attitudes
of rejection and protection were found. In the second study, unplanned children came from
significantly larger families than did planned children. It is postulated that the greater the
adversity of circumstance of the family, the more negative the effects of unplanned status will be

on emotional adjustment.

The arrival of an unwanted child may
create serious psychological consequences
for all concerned. Redman and Lieberman
(1973) have asserted that “unwanted pregnancy at any age is inimical to physical,
mental and social well-being for parents
and children.”

Although a number of authors have argued that unwanted children suffer adverse psychological consequences (e.g.,
Blau, 1964; Soddy, 1964), much of this
discussion has been speculative. Proper
empirical studies are either absent or
methodologically poor. After a thorough
review of the literature, Pohlman (1969)
discovered little evidence to support the
notion that unwanted conceptions have
undesirable effects, but he pointed out
that “on the whole, this is a matter of lack
of research and a lack of either positive or
negative findings rather than an accumulation of negative results” (p. 329). On a
more theoretical level, similar views were
expressed by David (1971).

After examining 120 Swedes at the age
of 21, who were born after their mothers
had been refused abortions, Forssman and

Thuwe (1966) concluded that they were
“worse off in every respect” compared to a
control series of wanted children. This
study, however, represents an extreme
case.

Our aim is to investigate the emotional
adjustment of unplanned versus planned
children and that of their mothers. The
psychological well-being of the mother is
extremely important in this respect because of the close emotional interaction
between mother and child. Furthermore,
the mother’s psychological state might be a
factor in her having had unplanned children. It could in addition be argued that
mothers might be less accepting of unplanned children. We also wish to determine whether there are differences in the
family size of planned and unplanned
children.

Our hypotheses are: (1) Unplanned children will be significantly more emotionally
disturbed than planned children. (2) The
mothers of unplanned children will be significantly more neurotic and rejecting than
the mothers of planned children. (3) Unplanned children will belong to  sig

nificantly larger families than will planned
children.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Two separate studies were carried out.
The first investigated only the childrens’
emotional adjustment, whereas the second
also looked at the mothers’ personalities
and the family size. The first study was
done earlier, and no questions were asked
about family size or about neuroticism or
attitudes among mothers.

SAMPLES

The first sample consisted of 58 planned
and 39 unplanned white children who
were ten- and eleven-year-old Std. 3
pupils (fifth year at school) in four schools.
Fifty-three children were from three private schools, catering to a middle class
population, while 44 were from a government school serving a low social class
area.

In the middle class, there were 36
planned and 17 unplanned children; and
in the lower class, 22 planned and 22 unplanned children.

The second sample consisted of 53
planned and 35 unplanned children who
were living with both natural parents at
the time of the study. The children were
all Std. 6 pupils (eighth year at school) at
two coeducational Cape Town schools.
The mean ages of the two groups of children were 13.45 and 13.27 years. The social class scale of the University of Cape
Town Child Guidance Clinic was used.
“Middle class” subjects refer to those children represented by Categories II and HI
on the social class scale given below;
“lower class” subjects, to children represented by Categories IV and V. Social
classes I and VI were unrepresented. In
the middle class, there were 43 planned
and 17 unplanned children; and in the
lower class, 10 planned and 18 unplanned
children.

Unplanned Versus Planned Children

255

The social class of the children was
determined by father’s occupation as follows: Class II, professionals, salaried executives, businessmen; Class III small
businessmen, small farmers, clerical
workers, white-collar workers, semiprofessionals; Class IV, skilled workers,
qualified tradesmen, apprentices; Class V,
semi-skilled workers.

ASSESSMENT TOOLS

The neuroticism scale of the Junior
Eysenck Personality Inventory (J.E.P.I.)
and the Rutter Parents’ and Teachers’
Questionnaires (scales A2 and B2 respectively) were used to assess the emotional
adjustment of the children.

Split-half reliabilities for the J.E.P.I.,
which average between 0.7 and 0.8, as
well as satisfactory test-retest reliabilities
have been obtained for all age groups on
all three scales of the Inventory (Eysenck,
1965). While little is known about the validity of the J.E.P.I., Eysenck (1965) has
reported the use of the Inventory with 229
English child guidance clinic subjects
who, as a group, have been found to be
significantly above the standardized sample with respect to neuroticism.

The Rutter Parents’ Questionnaire was
devised to fill a need for a reliable and
valid test suitable for use with children in
the middle age range and capable of identifying emotionally disturbed children
(Rutter et al., 1972). While satisfactory
retest and inter-rater reliability coefficients
have been obtained for the older forms of
the Parents’ and Teachers’ Questionnaires, these are still unavailable for the
latest improved versions of the tests, but
would be expected to be at least as good.

Since school teachers have the opportunity both to observe and to compare large
groups of children, and because of the
practical significance of the child’s behavior at school, the Rutter Teachers’ Questionnaire was also used.

In addition, in the second study, the
neuroticism scale of Form A of the
Eysenck Personality Inventory (E.P.I.)
was used to assess the neuroticism of the
mothers, while the rejection and protection scales of the Maryland Parent Attitude Survey were used to assess maternal
attitudes to the children.

The E.P.I. is widely used and its retest
reliability is reported to be in excess of
0.85 after the duration of a few months.
Eysenck and Eysenck (1964) have found a
general tendency for working-class groups
to be characterized by higher neuroticism
scores than middle-class groups.

The Maryland Parental Attitude Survey
(M.P.A.S.), also used in the second study,
was devised by Pumroy (1966) to fill a
need for a questionnaire that controls for
socia) desirability in the measurement of
parents’ attitudes toward child-rearing.
The M.P.A.S. consists of four categories
measuring parental attitudes: Disciplinarian, Indulgent, Protective, and Rejecting. The reliabilities for the four scales
vary from 0.622 to 0.843; validity studies
have indicated that the scales appear to be
relatively free of social desirability distortion.

PROCEDURE

The J.E.P.I. was administered to the
children during school hours. The class
teachers who came into daily contact with
the children were asked to complete Rutter Teachers’ Questionnaires on the sub

jects who had been in their classes for the
past six months.

In the second study, the children were
asked to take home copies of the E.P.L.,
the M.P.A.S., and the Rutter Parents’
Questionnaire to be completed by their
mothers. The data in the study was collected “blind” with respect to the child’s
planned or unplanned status. Each
mother was subsequently interviewed at
home and asked whether the child under
investigation had been planned by both
parents. The mothers who replied in the
negative were then questioned about
whether the child had been wanted at the
time of conception or in early pregnancy,
and also at birth. All the mothers in the
sample said that the child had been
wanted at birth.

RESULTS OF THE FIRST STUDY

For both the total group and the lower
social class sample, the unplanned chil- —
dren scored significantly higher than the
planned children on the neuroticism scale
of the J.E.P.I. and the Rutter Parents’
Questionnaire (Table 1). The middle social
class sample showed the same trend, but
not significantly so (Tables 2 and 3). It is of
interest to note that the Teachers’ Questionnaire did not reflect the same tendency. It would appear that the type of disturbed behavior which this questionnaire
assesses was not manifested in the classroom situation.

RESULTS OF THE SECOND STUDY

As a group, the unplanned children are
significantly more emotionally disturbed
than the planned children on the Rutter
Parents’ Questionnaire (5 per cent level).
Although not significant, the results of the
two other instruments followed the same
trend inasmuch as they tended toward the
emotionally disturbed dimension for the
unplanned sample (Table 4). Differences
between the scores of planned and unplanned children on the three questionnaires were also calculated separately for
the middle- and lower-class samples. For
both social classes, the unplanned children
had insignificantly higher neuroticism and
emotional disturbance scores on two of the
instruments, but this tendency was not
reflected by the results of the Teachers’
Questionnaire for the middle-class sample.

mothers on the neuroticism scale of the

tion, it is not quite statistically significant
(Table 5). The differences in the means on
the rejection and protection scales of the
M.P.A.S. are not significant, nor do they
tend in the predicted direction.

The difference in the mean size of the
families of planned and unplanned children is significant at the 5 per cent level. A
breakdown into percentages reveals that
the unplanned children belong to only 29.8
per cent of the small families (three or
fewer children) and to 56.2 per cent of the
large families in the sample.

DISCUSSION

The results seem to give limited support
to the hypothesis that unplanned children
have a greater degree of emotional disturbance than planned children. This finding
is probably due to the fact that the first
study contained a larger proportion of
children of a lower socioeconomic class. It
could be argued that in more extreme cir

cumstances, as with children of unmarried
mothers or with unplanned children in
families living in extreme poverty, the adverse effect on their emotional well-being
might be greater. This possibility is indeed
suggested by the study of Forssman and
Thuwe (1966), and it is also implied by the
results of the first study where the neuroticism scores of unplanned children were
higher in the lower-class sample.

There is a significantly higher incidence
of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies
among women in the lower social classes,
as was Clearly illustrated by a survey of
1,022 white married women under age
50 living in Johannesburg done by
Badenhorst (1963). This phenomenon,
viewed in the light of our own findings
that the association between unplanned
children and higher neuroticism is greater
for the lower than the middle social classes, has important implications. It would
appear that the lower social classes are
worse off in two respects. First, the conse
quences of being unplanned are apparently worse for lower-class children than
for children in the higher classes. Second,
lower-class women have to cope with
more unwanted pregnancies.

The finding of the present study that
unplanned children tend to come from
significantly larger families ties in well
with the findings of Badenhorst (1963).
There appears to be a reasonably logical
link between all these findings. It would
seem understandable that the arrival of an
unplanned child in a larger family, especially in a lower-income family, could
have more adverse consequences than its
arrival in a smaller family.

The hypothesis that the mothers of unplanned children will be more neurotic received only very slight and statistically insignificant support. This finding was
probably related to the high loading of
middle social class families in the second
study. As with the effects on the children,
it could be argued that the arrival of an

unplanned child would have a more adverse effect on the mother’s emotional
health where social or other circumstances
were less desirable. If further research
substantiated this hypothesis, it would
mean that the present sample of subjects
was not ideal for the testing of maternal
neuroticism because of the high percentage of middle-class families.

Whatever the outcome of further research might be, the conclusion that the
lack of successful family planning causes
greater emotional disturbance in either
mothers or children should be guarded
against. Cause and effect would be extremely difficult to disentangle. There may
be a deeper underlying factor contributing
to both greater emotional disturbance and
the inability to implement family planning
successfully. The arguments for cause and
effect in this paper must be regarded as
speculative.

Unplanned Versus Planned Children

259

There was no support whatsoever in the
second study for the hypothesis that the
mothers of unplanned children were more
rejecting toward their children. This
finding would tie in with the fact that the
mothers, without exception, reported that
the child was wanted at birth, even if not
earlier in the pregnancy. Again, it would
be interesting to see if this finding would
still hold true for mothers in more adverse
circumstances.

CONCLUSIONS

When one considers the two studies together, there is some support for the hypothesis that unplanned children are more
emotionally disturbed than planned children, particularly in the lower social classes. It is argued that for both mothers and
children the greater degree of emotional
disturbance associated with unplanned
children as compared to planned children
would probably be related to the degree of
adversity in which the family finds itself.
However, a simple cause and effect relationship between unplanned status and
emotional disturbance does not necessarily
follow.
