Political Affiliation and Attitudes
Toward Population Limitation

Larry D. Barnett

Department of Sociology
California State College
Los Angeles, California

The year 1969 seems to have witnessed
increasing interest by American political
leaders in the problems of population growth
in the United States and in the possibility of
controlling it. For instance, in September,
Dr. Roger Egeberg, Assistant Secretary for
Health and Scientific Affairs in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,
designated population growth in the United
States as one of the nation’s foremost health
problems.' This may have been the first time
that an administration official has publicly
labeled domestic population growth a serious problem. In addition, in an August letter
to the writer, Senator Joseph D. Tydings of
Maryland indicated his interest in controlling population growth in the United States
and added:

It is my hope that Congress will, in the near
future, begin to look at this question of overall growth [of population in the United States]
and begin to devise a national population

policy complete with economic incentives and
disincentives necessary for catrying it out.

There is every reason to believe that the
topic of domestic population control will become a major political issue in the not-toodistant future; yet no study to date has in

vironment Seen,” Los Angeles Times, September 21,

vestigated what differences, if any, exist by
political affiliation in attitudes toward population control. The present study attempts
to fill this gap.

The data for this study were derived
from a national public opinion poll conducted by The Gallup Organization in January, 1969, for the National Wildlife Federation. In addition to a question on political
affiliation, attitudes regarding population
limitation were measured by the following
item:

It has been said that it will, at some time, be

necessary to limit the human population

(number of people) if our present living stand
ards are to be maintained. Do you think this
will be necessary or not?

Whether the respondents’ referent for this
question was the population of the United
States or the population of the world in general is unclear. Most respondents probably
included the population of the United
States in the referent of the question, especially since the question was preceded by
two others referring to the spoiling of “our
natural surroundings.” However, there is no
reason to believe that the relationship between population control attitudes and
other variables such as political affiliation
would be markedly different depending on

whether U.S. or world population growth
was the referent.

The poll interviewed a total of 1,503
adults 21 years of age and over. This number
was inflated to 3,205 by a “‘times-at-home”
technique, Gallup’s method for reducing the
sample bias that would otherwise result
from under-representation (in the sample)
of persons who are difficult to find at home.
The data reported herein are based on the
inflated number.

falling midway between the two. In addition, Republicans were more likely to feel
population limitation was necessary than
they were to feel it was not necessary;
among Democrats, the reverse was true.
However, because of the larger number of
Democrats than Republicans in the United
States—40% of the sample listed themselves as Democrats and 27% as Republicans—there were numerically more Democrats than Republicans who felt that population limitation was necessary (516 versus
422). Since the poll was based on a nationally representative sample, the number
of cases of a specific type reflects the relative

affiliations in terms of attitudes toward population limitation, the chi-square test was
employed. While inferential statistics are
frequently not used in large-scale public
opinion polls, the subgroup analyses which
were run in this study involved relatively
small numbers, and a test of statistical significance thus seemed an appropriate basis
for deciding whether or not there was a difference between people of different political
affiliations in attitudes toward population
limitation.

numerical size of that group in the population.

To determine the conditions under which
the attitudinal differences held, a comparison was made between people of different
politica] affiliations under controls for the
seven variables related both to attitudes and
to political affiliation, since it is these variables which can account for the relationship
between political affiliation and attitudes.
The variables were education, occupation,
income, age, race, population of area of
residence, and region of the country.? Sex

nual before-tax income of all members of the immediate family in the household. Information on all

was not included as a variable because it
was related only to attitudes (with males
more favorable than females to population
limitation). Religion was not controlled because Protestants and Catholics did not
differ significantly in terms of attitudes. A
comparison of the attitudes of Protestants,
Catholics, and Jews yielded a significant
difference because of the comparatively high
proportion of Jews who felt population control] was necessary. However, there was an
inadequate number of Jewish cases in the
sample to permit an examination of the relationship between political afhliation and
attitudes among Jews by themselves.

The following analyses are concerned
only with differences between Republicans
and Democrats. It is recognized that Independents are proportionally and numerically larger than Republicans and that the
proportion of the population classifying itself as Independent increased during the
1960’s while the proportion considering itself to be Republican or Democrat fell
(Gallup, 1969). However, only the attitudinal differences between Republicans and
Democrats were of interest because there
are no other formally organized and continually operating national political parties
of sufficient strength to bring about population control in the United States.

other characteristics was for the respondent himself.

With regard to the variable ‘Population of Area
of Residence,” places within the urbanized area of
cities with a population of 50,000 and over were coded as the size of that central city.

Region of the country was controlled by dividing the United States into four areas: East, Midwest,
South, and West. The states included in each of
these areas are as follows:

East—Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, Vermont, and West Virginia.

Midwest—Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota,
Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.

South—Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina,
Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and
Virginia.

West—Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado,
Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,
Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.

Social Biology

The data in Table 2 indicate that, with
the aforementioned controls and the 0.05
significance level, Republicans were more
likely than Democrats to feel population
limitation was necessary among persons in
the following categories: an educational
level of Grade 8 or less, high-school graduates, members of households whose head
was a professional or business executive,
those with a family income under $3,000
annually, those under 40 years of age, Caucasians, residents of areas of 2,500 to 249,999
population, and residents of the East and
Midwest. (Interestingly, among members of
households whose head was a farmer or farm
laborer, Democrats were more likely than
Republicans to believe that population limitation was necessary.) However, using the
0.07 rather than the 0.05 significance level, a
considerably greater degree of regularity is
observed and the existence or nonexistence
of an association between political party and
population limitation attitudes is as follows:

Grade 8 or less education

High-school graduate

dinal difference between Republicans and
Democrats was reversed. The subgroups of
respondents appearing in the category ‘‘Significant Relationship” showed the general
attitudinal difference, that is, proportionally
more Republicans than Democrats felt that
population limitation was necessary.

In order to more clearly specify the conditions under which the relationship between party and attitudes held, the relationship was examined among respondents
simultaneously falling into a subgroup with
a significant relationship and a subgroup
with a nonsignificant relationship. For instance, the party-attitude association was
examined among those with an education
of no more than Grade 8 who were members
of households whose head was a blue-collar
worker, those with an education of no more
than Grade 8 who were members of families
earning at least $3,000, etc. The procedure
thus involved taking each of the subgroups
under “Significant Relationship” or ‘‘Nonsignificant Relationship” and breaking it
down into the subgroups in the other category. The principal findings from the fiftyfour contingency tables constructed can be
summarized as follows:

1. From the point of view of the subgroups characterized by a significant association, only the subgroup of persons 21-39
years of age generally continued to show a
significant relationship—-with Republicans
more likely than Democrats to consider
population limitation necessary—when broken down into the subgroups exhibiting a
nonsignificant relationship.

2. When Negroes (who exhibited a nonsignificant association) were broken down into the subgroups exhibiting a significant relationship, there were no significant Republican-Democrat differences in attitudes
toward population limitation.

3. When persons with a family income of
at least $3,000 (who exhibited a nonsignificant association) were broken down into the
subgroups with a significant relationship,

Republicans were in general significantly
more likely than Democrats to see population limitation as necessary. On the other
hand, when persons with a family income
under $3,000 (who exhibited a significant rejationship) were broken down into the subgroups exhibiting a nonsignificant association, there was generally no significant relationship between political affiliation and
population limitation attitudes.

Let us now turn to the variables which
are associated with attitudinal differences
among Republicans and among Democrats.
Within each political party, what variables
are associated with differences in population
control attitudes? Each of the variables
controlled for in Table 2 was examined for
its relationship to population limitation attitudes among Republicans and among
Democrats. Table 3 presents the chi-square
value and significance level for each relationship. The reader can determine the
percentage distributions in each relationship from Table 2 by examining the percentages for a particular variable within
each political party.

Education differentiated both Republicans and Democrats in terms of attitudes.
Among Democrats, there was an increase
in the proportion favorable toward population limitation with each increase in educational level. Among Republicans, the relationship was not as regular, but those not
having graduated from high school were
less likely to feel population limitation is
necessary than high school graduates and
those with some college, the latter categories being in turn less likely to feel population limitation is necessary than college
graduates.

Occupation of the household head differentiated Republicans, but not Democrats,
in terms of attitudes. Among Republicans,
members of households whose head was a
white-collar or skilled worker were more
likely to consider population control necessary than members of households whose

head was an unskilled worker, farmer, or
farm laborer. Among Democrats, differences in the occupation of the household
head were not associated with differences in
attitudes. Members of households whose
head was a farmer or farm laborer seemed
more likely in relation to other occupational
groupings among Democrats to support population control; but a comparison of the
farmer—farm laborer occupational grouping
with the two occupational groupings—professional-business executive and unskilled
worker—having the most similar attitude
distributions yielded nonsignificant differences; thus, the farmer—farm laborer grouping cannot be said to stand out from the occupational groupings among Democrats.

In both political parties, income differ
ences were associated with attitudinal differences. Among Republicans, $7,000 constituted an important breaking point, with
those in families earning less than $7,000
appreciably less likely than those in families
earning more to feel that population limitation is necessary. Among Democrats, a family income under $3,000 was associated with
less support for population limitation than
was a family income of $3,000~-$6,999; in
turn, Democrats in families earning $3,000—
$6,999 were less favorable toward population control than Democrats in families with
an income of $7,000 or more.

For both parties, differences in age were
associated with differences in attitudes.
Among Republicans, those under 30 were
more likely to feel population limitation is

necessary than those 30-49, who in turn
were more likely to consider population
limitation necessary than those 50 years of
age and older. Among Democrats, those
under 30 were more favorable to population
limitation than those 30-59, who in turn
exhibited a more positive attitude toward
population control than those 60 years of
age and older.

In a breakdown by race, both political
parties exhibited significant attitudinal differences. Among Republicans and Democrats, Caucasians were more likely than Negroes to feel population control was necessary. The difference between the races was
noticeably greater among Republicans than
Democrats.

With regard to population of area of residence, both Republicans and Democrats exhibited significant attitudinal differences
when examined on this variable. Among
Republicans, the major break was between
residents of areas of under 2,500 population
and residents of areas with greater population, the latter being more likely than the
former to view population control as necessary. Among Democrats, residents of areas
with under 2,500 population and residents
of areas with a population of 250,000 or
larger were more favorable toward population limitation than residents of areas of
2,500-249,999 population.

Section of the country differentiated both
political parties in terms of attitudes. Among
Republicans, while no appreciable differences existed between sections in the proportion feeling population control was not
necessary, those living in the South were
less likely to consider population control
necessary than those living elsewhere.
Among Democrats, those living in the South
were less likely to consider population limitation necessary than those in the East or
Midwest, who in turn were less likely to see
population limitation as necessary than
those in the West. However, the proportion
of Democrats viewing population control as

Social Biology

not necessary was about the same in the
Midwest asin the South and about the same
in the East as in the West.

Finally, it would seem important to delineate the subgroups characterized by an
appreciable degree of uncertainty regarding
the necessity of population limitation.
Among Republicans, two subgroups were
characterized by at least 20% “Don’t
Know” responses: those with no more than
a Grade 8 education and those living in the
South. Four subgroups in the Democratic
Party possessed a 20% or higher “Don’t
Know” response rate: those with no more
than Grade 8 schooling, those in families
earning under $3,000 annually, those living
in cities of at least a million in population,?
and those living in the East.

CONCLUSION

What general conclusions can be derived
from a survey of the data? In the first place,
the evidence indicates that the Republican
Party is likely to take a formal position
favoring population control measures earlier
than the Democratic Party. Those whose
goal is formal action by a political party
aimed at controlling population growth
should find the Republican Party more
amenable than the Democratic Party to
such action. Among Republicans, support
for population limitation measures is more
likely to come from those with at least a
high-school diploma rather than those with
less education, those who are members of
households whose head is a white-collar or
skilled worker rather than members of
households whose head is an unskilled
worker, farmer, or farm laborer, those in
families earning at least $7,000 rather than
those in families earning less, those under
50 years of age rather than those older,
Caucasians rather than Negroes, and those
living outside the South rather than those
living in the South.

3’ Among Democrats, 21% did not know as opposed to 13% among Republicans.

Among Democrats, support for population Jimitation measures will come most
readily from those with college experience,
those in families earning at least $7,000
annually, those under 30 years of age,
Caucasians, those living in areas with under
2,500 population or over 250,000 population,
and those living in the West.

Finally, in an analysis of RepublicanDemocrat attitudinal differences In subpopulations only one subpopulation—that of
persons 21-39 years of age—generally continued to show Republicans more favorable
to population limitation than Democrats.

Population Limitation 131

Except in this subpopulation-—-which consists of persons born from 1930 through 1948
—Republican-Democrat attitudinal differences generally did not continue to exist.
