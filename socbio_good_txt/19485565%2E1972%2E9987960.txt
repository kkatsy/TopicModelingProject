One of the most fundamental features
of any population is the distribution of its
members according to age. As noted elsewhere (Stockwell, 1964), almost any aspect
of human behavior, from subjective attitudes and physiological capabilities to objective characteristics such as income, labor
force participation, occupation, or group
membership, may be expected to vary with
age. Further, the specific needs and problems of a given society, both now and in
the future, will in large part be determined
by the age structure of its population.

A population with a high proportion of
young persons, for example, may be expected to differ from one that has a high
proportion of older members in its productive capacity, in its attitudes toward various
socioeconomic and political issues, in its
tastes and consumption patterns, and in its
particular needs and problems. The measurement of labor force efficiency and the
determination of productive capacity require reference to the number of persons
within the active adult ages in relation to
the number outside these ages, both young
and old.

The adequacy of facilities such as housing, schools, and convalescent hospitals de
 

pends, respectively, on the number of young
people who are marrying and starting their
families, the number of school- and preschool-age children, and the number of older
persons. Levels of fertility and mortality in
a population, and consequently its rate of
natural increase, will be influenced by its
age composition. The number and proportion of elderly people in a society has important implications for problems of old
age security such as jobs for older workers,
medical and health benefits, and pensions
for the aged. For these as well as many
other reasons that could be cited (Bogue,
1959, p. 92-94), a knowledge of the current
age structure, how it came into being, and
what its consequences are likely to be for
future population trends is essential as a
basis both for determining present needs
and for adequate planning with regard to
the future needs of a population.

TRENDS IN MEDIAN AGE

The most commonly used summary measure of whether a population is young or
old, and how its age composition has been
changing, is the median age. The median
age of the American population at each
census since 1900 is presented in Table 1,

Inspection of these data indicates that during the first half of the twentieth century
the trend was for the population to become
older. Between 1900 and 1950, the median
age in the United States increased from
22.9 to 30.2 years, or by 7.3 years (nearly
one and one-half years per decade). Partly
because of the sharp reduction of foreign
immigration following the adoption of federal restrictive legislation, but mostly as a
result of the cumulative effects of the historical decline in ferility, the rise in the
median age was most pronounced after
1920. The especially large increase of 2.6
years between 1930 and 1940 reflects the
particularly low birth rates of the Depression decade, while the substantially smaller
increase between 1940 and 1950 reflects
the initial impact of the postwar fertility
revival.

In contrast to the first half of the century,
the trend since 1950 has been for the population to become younger. In 1960, the
median age of 29.5 was seven-tenths of a
year lower than it was ten years earlier,
and the 1970 median age (27.9 years) was
1.6 years below that of 1960. This reversal
of an increasing trend that had been in
evidence for several decades can only be
explained by reference to the cessation of
the long-time fertility decline during World

 

War II and a subsequent rise in the birth
rate and its continuation at fairly high
levels throughout the 1950’s. This reversal
of the downward trend in the birth rate,
which has come to be referred to as the
“baby boom,” has resulted in substantial
increases in both the number and proportion
of youth in the population and has consequently brought about a reduction in the
median age.

In citing the postwar fertility revival as
the “cause” of the pronounced drop in the
median age of the American population
since 1950, it must be stressed that this
“baby boom” was only temporary. Since
1957 the birth rate in this country has
undergone a precipitous decline and is today
at one of its lowest levels in our history.
More significantly, the absolute number of
births per year has been declining since
1961 (U.S. Public Health Service, 1970).
Should the present low level of fertility
persist into the 1970’s, it would soon lead
to another major reversal in the trend of the
median age, and the population would once
again become an aging one. As of now, however, the reduced number of births since
1961 has not been sufficient to offset the
pronounced impact of the postwar baby
boom on the overall age of the American
population.

THE LIFE CYCLE

Although median age is a useful measure
for providing a general indication of the
age composition of a population, it is of
limited value in more detailed analyses.
The procedure commonly followed when
greater precision is desired is to examine
the proportions of the population falling
into particular age groups. Here it is useful
to designate three broad age groups which
may be assumed to correspond roughly to
the three major stages of the life cycle:
youth (under 15 years); adulthood (15 to
64 years); and old age (65 years and over).
The composition of the nation’s population
according to these three broad age groups
is also presented in Table 1. These data
clearly depict the major changes that have
occurred in each stage of the life cycle during the present century.

Prior to the 1940-SO decade, a major
trend was a consistent decline in the proportion of the population under 15 years of
age. At the beginning of the present century
slightly more than one out of every three
persons in the United States fell into this
age group, but by 1940, after several decades of declining birth rates, this ratio had
fallen to one in four. Since 1940, however,
the erratic pattern of fertility has resulted
in two reversals of this trend. First, the
postwar baby boom led to an increase in
the proportion of youth, especially during
the 1950’s, and by 1960 the number of
persons under 15 years of age was once
again roughly one out of three. The sharp
declines in fertility during the most recent
decade, however, have brought about another decline in this proportion-—to 28.4%
in 1970,

For the adult ages, the effect of the fiuctuating fertility trend of the present century
was the reverse of its effect on the relative
size of the youth group. As the proportion
of youth fell during the years of declining

 

Changing Age Composition 3

fertility the proportion of the population
15 to 64 years of age increased, from 62%
in 1900 to 68% in 1940. Between 1940 and
1960, as a consequence of the higher fertility of the postwar baby boom, the per
cent of the population falling into these
active adult ages declined to a level below
that existing at the beginning of the century; however, the renewed fertility decline
of the 1960’s has led to the emergence of a
hew upward trend. At the time of the most
recent census, approximately 62% of the
American population was between the ages
of 15 and 64 years, an increase of some 2
percentage points over the 1960 figure.

The major difference between the 1970
population and that at the beginning of the
century is found in the proportion of elderly
persons. In 1970 the percentage of the
population 65 years of age and over was
well over twice as great as it was in 1900—
9.8% as opposed to only 4.1% at the turn
of the century. In terms of absolute numbers the change has been even more striking. In 1900 there were slightly more than
three million persons age 65 and over in
the United States; by 1970 this number
had swelled to more than twenty million,
representing nearly a six-fold increase during the preceding seventy years.

THE AGING TREND

A particularly useful technique for depicting more precisely the changes that have
taken place with respect to the older segment of the population is the index of aging,
which may be defined as the number of
persons age 65 and over per 100 children
under 15 years of age. These indexes have
been calculated by the author for the
United States from 1900 to 1970 and are
presented in Table 2. Inspection of these
data indicates that prior to the 1950-60
decade the aging index had increased during
each decennial interval, with the increase
being particularly marked between 1920

and 1940. In 1950 there were roughly 30
persons age 65 and over per 100 under 15
years in the United States, as opposed to
only 12 in 1900. That is, during the first
half of the twentieth century the number
of older persons relative to the number of
children in the population more than
doubled.

Although partly due to the drying up
of the immigration stream following the
adoption of federal restrictive legislation,
the pronounced “aging” of the population
between 1900 and 1950 was largely the
result of the cumulative effects of the historical decline in the birth rate. Contrary
to popular belief, the increasing proportion
of elderly persons was not related to the
pronounced decline in the death rate that
has also taken place during the present
century. In fact, the fraction over 65 today would be larger and the average age of
the population greater if mortality had not
declined during the present century. Although the increase in the absolute number
of older people was indeed the consequence
of improvements in death control, the fact
that declines in mortality were greatest
among infants and youg children meant that
a larger proportion of births survived, and
this larger proportion who remained alive
actually served to retard the aging of the
population. Thus, it was the decline in

the number of births rather than a decline
in mortality that brought about the increase
in the proportion of older people in the
population (United Nations, 1954, p. 3038; Kiser, 1962; Coale, 1964).

The relationship of declining fertility to
population aging in the United States is
readily apparent from the fact that the
greatest increase in the index of aging occurred between 1930 and 1940, or during
the same period that the decline in fertility
was most pronounced. By the same reasoning, the much smaller increase between
1940 and 1950, and the slight rejuvenation
that took place between 1950 and 1960,
reflect the relatively high levels of fertility
that prevailed from the end of World War
II through the 1950-60 decade. Similarly,
it was the sharp drop in fertility during the
1960’s that “caused” the equally sharp
rise in the index of aging during the most
recent decennial interval. During the preceding decade the index of aging increased
by 16%, and in 1970 there were nearly 35
persons age 65 and over per 100 under 15
years of age. This is the highest index of
aging that has ever prevailed in this country, and it clearly reveals that despite its
relatively low median age the United States
continues to be characterized by an aging
population. In other words, the postwar
baby boom has so far had only a delaying

Vol. 19, No. 1

effect with respect to halting the historical
aging of the American population. Whether
or not it will have an additional impact
depends solely on the future fertility of the
earlier baby boom cohorts themselves as
they take over the main reproductive ages
during the coming decade.

DEPENDENCY

Another tool for depicting the changes
that have taken place with respect to the
age composition of the population is the
dependency ratio, or the number of persons
under 15 and over 65 years of age per 100
persons in the age group 15 to 64 years.
This measure provides a crude indication of
the average number of persons which each
100 adults would be required to support
and care for zf the dependency load was
equally divided among the adult population,
and if all persons under 15 and over 65
could be regarded as economically dependent upon the rest of the population.
Neither of these conditions is met completely, however, and the degree to which
they are approximated varies among different population groups and at different
periods of time. Nevertheless, in spite of
its limitations as an economic indicator,
this ratio is very useful for making general
comparisons and for indicating some of the
consequences of changes in age composition.

According to the data presented in Table
2 the total dependency ratio in the United
States declined during the early decades of
the twentieth century; between 1900 and
1940 the number of dependents under 15
and over 65 per 100 persons age 15-64 fell
from 62.6 to 46.8, or by 25%. From 1940
to 1960, however, there was a marked increase in the burden of dependency, and
the 1960 ratio of 67.6 dependents per 100
active adults was the highest ever attained
during the present century. Since that time,
a downward trend has reappeared, and the

Changing Age Composition 5

1970 dependency ratio (61.7) is almost
10% below what it was in 1960.

The main reason that the dependency
ratio has fluctuated since 1940 lies in the
changes in the relative size of the younger
population. This can readily be seen by
considering the total dependency ratio in
terms of its component parts: youth dependency, or the number of children under
15 per 100 persons 15~64 years of age; and
aged dependency, or the number 65 and
over per 100 age 15-64. When these component ratios are examined, two conclusions
are apparent. First, there has been a steady
and consistent increase in aged dependency
since 1900. In 1970 there were nearly 16
older dependents per 100 adults, or well
over twice as many as there had been at the
beginning of the century. Second, the trend
in youth dependency has been erratic and
parallels closely the fertility trends since
1900. That is, youth dependency declined
steadily up to 1940; it increased markedly
(by 42%) between 1940 and 1960 as a
result of the postwar baby boom era; and
it declined during the present decade as a
response to the downward fertility trend
of the 1960’s. Clearly, the fluctuating birth
rate of the past 25 years has had a profound
effect on the age structure of the American
population.

DETAILED CHANGES SINCE 1960

With three notable exceptions, each age
group in the United States population
showed an increase over 1960 (see Table
3). Two of the exceptions (ages 30-34 and
35-39 years, which showed a decrease during the decade of 4% and 10% respectively) represent the passing into an older
age of the generation that was born during
the period of low birth rates in the 1930’s.
The other exception, a decline of nearly
16% in the size of the population under 5
years of age, clearly reveals the magnitude

of the recent “birth dearth” in the United
States. The impact of this recent fertility
decline is also reflected in the relatively
small increase in the 5—9 year age group.

Reflecting the high level of fertility of the
1945-55 baby boom decade, the greatest
increases were for ages 15-19 (45%) and
20-24 (58%). The biggest increase noted
for any group, both numerically and in
percentage terms, characterized the group
aged 20-24 years which grew by more than
6 million between 1960 and 1970.

The population at ages 40-64 also increased at each age group during the decade,
but nowhere was the increase as great as
that noted for the young adult population.
Increments at these older ages ranged from
approximately 3% for the group 40-44
years old (who were also born at a time
when fertility was relatively low) to just
over 20% for persons aged 60-64 years.
Further, as noted in earlier sections, the
older population has also gained fairly
heavily in recent years. In 1970, there were
more than 20 million persons age 65 and
over in the United States, or 21% more
than were enumerated in 1960.

To summarize briefly: Between 1960 and
1970 the population of the United States
experienced fairly rapid gains at the young
adult and older ages, especially the former.
However, for the middle-age adults (the age
30-39 survivors of the Depression birth
cohorts), numbers declined. Finally, there
was a substantial decline (16%) in the
size of the child population under 5 years
of age. This decline was not anticipated a
few years age, due to the expected increase
in the number of young adults having
babies, and has come about because of the
marked fertility declines of the 1960’s. This
development, which is perhaps the most
noteworthy change in the American age
structure over the past decade, clearly reveals the very close association between the
trend in fertility and the trend in the age
composition of a population.

OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE

In speculating about the future trend in
the age composition of the American population, the most important thing to keep in
mind is that the age structure in the years

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 19, No. 1

to come will largely be determined by the
future course of fertility. In noting this,
however, it is necessary to make the converse observation that the future course of
fertility will be significantly influenced by
the age structure of the population. For
example, since about three-fourths of all
births in the United States occur to women
at ages 20-34 years, any marked variations
in the fraction that this group makes up of
the total population will be reflected in the
overall level of fertility. And such a marked
change in this fraction of the American
population is about to occur. Beginning in
the late 1960’s, the first of the larger postwar baby boom cohorts began to reach age
20; and by the end of the 1970 decade it is
estimated that the number of women 20-34
years of age will have increased from 21.1
million in 1970 to 28.8 million in 1980, or
by 36% (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1968).
In other words, 1980 will see nearly eight
million more potential mothers than there
were in 1970. Thus, unless the present low
birth rates decline even further, to levels
never before experienced in the United
States, the substantially larger number of
potentia] mothers in the coming decade will
result in a significant increase in the absolute number of births, a continuation of
the current low median age, and very likely
another reversal in the recently reinstated
aging trend.

At the present time, there is some evidence to suggest that fertility levels are
continuing to fall. For example, as of July
1, 1971, there were an estimated 22.1 million women at the main reproductive age
of 20-34 years. This compares to 21.3
million estimated for July 1, 1970 and is an
increase of nearly 4% (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1971). Given a stationary level of
fertility, one might have expected a corresponding increase in the number of live
births. In point of fact, however, the op
Changing Age Composition 7

posite has been the case. For the sevenmonth period January-July, 1971, there
were only 2,050,000 live births estimated
in the United States, or 47,000 fewer than
the 2,097,000 estimated for the comparable
period in 1970. Similarly, the number of
live births estimated for July, 1971
(295,000) was nearly 10% less than the
326,000 births in July of 1970 (National
Center for Health Statistics, 1971). In
other words, the number of live births is
declining at a time when most experts had
anticipated that the increasing number of
young potential mothers would be accompanied by more births.

It is still far too early to reach any kind
of definite conclusion with respect to the
future course of American fertility and its
effect on the age composition of the population. If recent downward trends in fertility
continue even further, the declining trend
in median age could be reversed and the
aging trend could become even more pronounced. On the other hand, a constant
level of fertility in the face of the fairly
large increase in the number of potential
mothers could result in an increase in the
number of births and another slowing down,
perhaps even a reversal, of the present aging
trend. Any increases in fertility among
women age 20-34 years during the coming
decade would, of course, lead to a marked
increase in births and in the proportion of
youth in the population and could create a
situation in which the 1970’s would have a
baby boom substantially greater than that
which characterized the late forties and
early fifties. In any event, the important
point to note is that the level of fertility
and age composition of a population are
dynamically interrelated and that the future
age composition of the American population
will depend largely on the fertility behavior
of the postwar baby boom cohorts during
the coming decade.
