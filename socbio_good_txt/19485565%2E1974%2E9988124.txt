Income and Childlessness in the
United States: Is the Relationship

Always Inverse?

Dudley L. Poston, Jr.

Austin, Texas

The relationship between income and
childlessness is an especially problematic
and complex one. While it is true that recent
research suggests the relationship to be
inverse, that is, the higher the income category, the lower the rate of childlessness
(Kunz et al., 1973), the reasoning with
which these findings are interpreted is
based on only one type of childlessness—
that form due to involuntary factors. In
this paper we suggest that among the
voluntarily childless, the relationship need
not necessarily be inverse. After reviewing
the studies which have examined the general relationship, we focus upon the voluntarily childless and suggest an alternative
hypothesis. The hypothesis is tested indirectly with data from the 1970 US.
Census of Population.

PREVIOUS STUDIES

In general, the research on income and
childlessness is limited to two analyses. The
first was conducted by Grabill and Glick
(1959) with data from the April 1952
Current Population Survey. Their data

 

suggested an overall inverse relationship.
However, they noted that race, labor force
participation of the wife, and other variables were not controlled; and indeed the
authors introduced alternative explanations
for the observed negative relationship.

A more specific analysis was executed by
Kunz et al. (1973) with data from the
1960 United States Census. Here the analysis focused on women 35-54 years old and
examined their rates of childlessness by
five categories of husband’s income, In the
total sample of over 13 million wives, the
relationship was shown to be inverse. The
sample was then subdivided, first by race,
second by occupational category of the
husband, and third by educational attainment of the husband. Even when these
three variables were controlled, the original
inverse relationship between income and
childlessness was for the most part upheld.
Among whites and blacks, at every occupational category, at every level of educational attainment, the greatest degree of
childlessness occurred among the poor, and
the least among the wealthy.

Kunz and his colleagues saw three major
reasons for the observed negative relationship. The first was prenatal health care.
Since the rich can afford better health care
than the poor during the pregnancy period,
the poor will suffer more pregnancy losses
proportionately than the rich and will thus
be more likely to remain childless.

A second reason concerned the medical
attention necessary for correcting problems
related to subfecundity. Since the poor
cannot afford this medical assistance, more
of them will remain subfecund—and hence
perhaps childless—than the rich.

A third factor was that “wealthy families
can simply afford to have more children
than the poor” (Kunz et al., 1973, p. 142).
This reasoning is consistent with the much
debated hypothesis of Becker (1960) in
which income is directly related to fertility
in general. In this framework, it follows
that the poor would more often be childless
than the rich.

The bulk of the interpretation of the inverse relationship between income and
childlessness does not admit the possibility
that some couples may choose voluntarily
to have no children. The scant attention
accorded this possibility may result in part
from the lack of approval accorded childlessness by the society at large. Childlessness is a State neither supported nor encouraged by our society’s normative and
value structure. Since the phenomenon is
obviously dysfunctional for the society’s
replacement and ultimate survival, the
childed state is valued in its own right
(Griffith, 1973), and those couples who do
not have children can expect to experience
severe negative sanctions (Veevers, 1973;
Blake, 1974, esp. pp. 36-37).

As a consequence, scholars have generally
been inclined to view childlessness in the
light of these normative proscriptions, Since
social pressures work so much against
childlessness, many scholars have concluded

 

Income and Childlessness

 

(297

that few couples will choose that state
voluntarily. Martinson (1970, p. 314), for
example, notes that “the desire for children
is nearly universal. Marriages childless by
choice are practically nonexistent.” Observing that children are highly valued in the
United States, another scholar remarks that
“the majority of [American] childless
couples are not that way by choice” (Bell,
1971, p. 417).1 Childlessness is thus seen
for the most part as an involuntary state.

THE VOLUNTARILY CHILDLESS

If indeed it were true that most childlessness was a result of involuntary, i.e.,
biological and physiological factors, then
the various interpretations behind its negative relationship with income (e.g., those of
Kunz et al., 1973) might be justified. But
empirical data and estimates do not suggest the universality of involuntary childlessness.

Veevers (1972) recently estimated the
extent of voluntary childlessness in Canada.
A 20 per cent fertility sample of the 1961
Canadian census was employed as the base,
and estimates were computed for urban
women aged 45 years and older. Taking
the minimum rates of childlessness ‘among
women in rural farm Quebec .. . as estimates of the maximum possible rates of
physiological [i.e., involuntary] childlessness,” Veevers (1972, p. 269) estimated
voluntary childlessness among urban Canadian women beyond the childbearing
years. Veevers (1972, p. 273) observed that
at least half of the childlessness occurring in
this population of women may very well
have been voluntary.

Another study (Waller et al., 1973) was
interested in the extent to which childless
families were heterogeneous with respect to

social scientists and family life scholars on the
extent of childlessness in the United States, see

fecundity. The authors attempted to fit
“a negative binomial distribution to observed frequencies of completed family size
and noted that the number of childless
families is invariably greater, than the
fitted or expected number, although the
fitting is generally good for the rest of the
distribution” (Waller et al., 1973, p. 133).
They hypothesized that childless families
were a mixture of two types: those who
were biologically fertile, and those who
were Sterile (biologically or deliberately).
They concluded that the childless couples
were divided quite evenly between the two
types. While it is true that Waller and his
colleagues did not employ a voluntaryinvoluntary dichotomy in their conceptualization of childlessness, they were successful in demonstrating that childlessness is
not solely the result of involuntary factors.

In addition, many have argued that the
1960’s has been a decade of change with
respect to contraceptive technology, sexual
and family norms, and female work patterns
and preferences (Bumpass, 1973; Ryder,
1973; Westoff, 1972). One would thus expect the incidence of voluntary childlessness to be even more predominant today
than it was a decade or two ago. Tomasson’s
(1966, p. 328) statement citing “the virtual
disappearance of deliberate childlessness”
becomes questionable, given the above
estimates and arguments.

But why then does the relationship between income and childlessness still remain negative? Even though Kunz et al.
(1973) virtually ignored voluntary childlessness in their interpretations, their data
still indicate a negative relationship. Is it
likely that this relationship would not obtain in certain portions of the total population? We would answer this question
affirmatively and will attempt to present
below our justification, In one subpopulation particularly, the voluntarily childless,
the inverse relationship with income should
not obtain.

Social Biology

INCOME AND THE VOLUNTARILY CHILDLESS

The voluntarily childless are a subpopulation about whom we have only scattered information. We know very little
about their demographic and social characteristics, and even less about their reasons
for wanting to remain childless. Our discussion below relies in part on the only two
studies of voluntary childlessness that we
were able to uncover: a study by Gustavus
and Henley (1971) of childless couples
who applied to the Association for Voluntary Sterilization for surgical sterilizations,
and a study by Veevers (1973) based on indepth unstructured interviews with a nonrandom sample of voluntarily childless
wives in the Toronto and London areas of
Canada.

In any discussion of income and voluntary childlessness, one of the most important concerns is the nature of their
childlessness. How do couples arrive at the
decision to remain childless, and what
reasons are the crucial ones? In the study
by Veevers (1973), nearly a third of the
wives had agreed explicitly with their husbands before marriage that they would not
have children. The remaining “two thirds
of the wives .. . remained childless as a
result of a series of decisions to postpone
having children until some future time, a
future which never came” (Veevers, 1973,
p. 359).

Although Veevers does not discuss
specific reasons for childlessness, it is clear
that economic concerns, among others, play
a role, especially for the two-thirds of the
sample who did not decide on childlessness
prior to marriage. At some point after
marriage, Veevers (1973, p. 359) notes,
“.. . for the first time there is an open
acknowledgement of the possibility that in
the end the couple may remain permanently
childless.”

During this time [the couples] have an

opportunity to experience directly the many
social, personal, and economic advantages

Vol. 21, No. 3

associated with being childless, and at the
same time to compare their life styles with
those of their peers who are raising children.
It seems probable that the social psychological factors involved in the initial decision
to postpone having children may be quite
disparate from the social psychological factors involved in the inclination to remain
childless, and to continue with the advantage
of a lifestyle to which [they have] become
accustomed (Veevers, 1973, p. 360).

In many instances presumably, both
marriage partners are in the labor force and
have been gainfully employed since becoming married. (The reasons for both husband
and wife being employed at marriage, however, need not be the same as those for their
continued employment after marriage.)
For example, as they become more involved
in their respective careers, the costs of
bearing children, economic and otherwise,
become increasingly important in their
decision to remain childless. As their joint
incomes increase, it would appear that their
career and life-style commitments would
become even more intense, and hence, children would be seen as even greater liabilities. Clearly, the above reasoning has
little empirical grounding and is based for
the most part upon conjecture and speculation. Nonetheless, we would hypothesize
that the relationship between income and
degree of voluntary childlessness should be
direct.

In summary, we have argued for a positive relationship between income and voluntary childlessness. Earlier investigations of
this relationship have made no distinction
between the voluntarily and the involuntarily childless, and their results have suggested an inverse relation between income
and childlessness. The question now is
whether the voluntary-involuntary distinction is worth pursuing when investigating
the nature of the relationship between income and childlessness. One could point to
the earlier analyses (Kunz et al., 1973) and
conclude that a voluntary-involuntary
childlessness bifurcation is not viable em

pirically, despite its conceptual utility.
Alternatively, since there is evidence suggesting a greater incidence of involuntary
rather than voluntary childlessness, it would
appear plausible to argue that one reason
an inverse relationship with income was
obtained results from the greater numbers
of involuntarily childless.

To test this latter hypothesis, one would
need a population of wives where the childless ones were so defined voluntarily. Unfortunately, available census data do not
make a distinction between the voluntarily
and involuntarily childless. A direct test of
the hypothesis is thus not possible. However, census data may be employed in an
indirect test of the hypothesis. That is, the
sample population may be delimited in such
a manner that the presence of the involuntarily childless is restricted, and hence the
representation of the voluntarily childless
is increased. We focus below on the sample
restrictions and the indirect test of the hypothesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Certain restrictions are necessary in defining a population in such a way that
preference is given to the voluntarily
childless. It would appear that the test population would be different from the larger
population employed by Kunz et al. (1973)
in at least three ways: income should be
defined differently, and controls should be
placed on wife’s labor force participation
and wife’s age at marriage.

Looking first at the measurement of
income, Kunz and his colleagues employed
husband’s income. This decision may have
been based on the fact that in fertility research in general, husband’s income is
preferred to a broader measure such as
family income. Bean and Wood (1974),
for example, note that husband’s and wife’s
incomes probably operate in different directions with fertility, thereby offsetting one
another when combined into a single meaDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

sure of family income. But one could well
argue that among childless couples, especially those who have chosen the state
voluntarily, the presence of the wife’s income plays a major role in the decision to
remain childless. We would agree with
Gustavus and Henley (1971) that there
are important qualitative differences between those who have children and those
who do not, suggesting that childlessness
should not be viewed as but another quantitative state of parity, 1.e., zero parity. We
have reasoned that the wife’s contribution
to total family income is likely to influence
the couple’s decision to remain childless;
the analysis of the relationship between
income and childlessness should thus be
based upon family income, and not husband’s income alone.

The study by Kunz et al. (1973) of income and childlessness in the total population included all married women (with
husband present) regardless of whether or
not they were in the labor force. But since
as we noted earlier an important factor
influencing a couple’s decision to remain
childless may be their life style and respective careers, it would appear that wives
who are not in the labor force are less likely
to be childless by choice and should thus be
excluded from the test population. Accordingly, the sample in which our hypothesis of a positive relationship between
income and voluntary childlessness is to be
tested will be restricted to wives who are in
the labor force.

Finally, earlier analyses of income and
childlessness have placed no restrictions on
wife’s age at marriage, one of the most
important variables affecting the degree of
childlessness in a population. Veevers
(1971, p. 292) notes that “women who
marry relatively late in life are exposed to
the risk of pregnancy for fewer years than
younger brides.” If they are childless voluntarily, they will be subjected to the risk of

Social Biology

having children for fewer years than those
who married earlier.”

One might argue, however, that the relationship is not solely a biological one, especially if the childlessness is voluntary.
Consider the woman with a college education beginning a career. Many such women
will delay marriage, at least until their
twenties; once married, some may well
decide to remain childless in order to devote
themselves to their careers. Indeed, the
biological factors involved may have minimal impact. As Veevers commented (1971,
p. 294), “Perhaps the predispositions
which prevent early marriage are also associated with a decreased inclination to
parenthood and a relatively higher incidence of voluntary childlessness.” Accordingly, concerning age at marriage, we argue
for restricting the sample population to
women who were married at age 22 years
or older.?

The population in which our hypothesis
will be tested is thus comprised of white
women, 35-44 years old, married once, who
are wives of civilian household heads employed in nonfarm occupations. These
women were married at age 22 or later and
are in the labor force. The basic data are
taken from the Subject Report on “Women
by Number of Children Ever Born’ contained in the 1970 U.S. Census of Population. The income measure employed is
family income in 1969.

2 There are two additional reasons for the relationship. Since fecundity declines with age, the
later marriage is postponed, “the lower the chances
that one will be able to bear even one child”;
and “those women who marry for the first time
very late, after the age of 40, may already be
experiencing the beginning of menopause and
rapidly approaching total sterility” (Veevers, 1971,
p. 292

3 We would prefer to impose an even greater
restriction on age at marriage, say, women who
Were married at age 25, or even 30 years or
older, thus giving them full opportunity to become involved in their careers before marrying.
The manner in which the available census data
are cross-tabulated does not permit the more
narrow restriction on age at marriage.

The tests of the hypothesis about income
and childlessness are based on data in many
ways different from those employed by
Kunz et al, (1973): (1) The income variable is family income, rather than husband’s income. (2) The only wives
examined are those who married at age 22
or later, and who are in the labor force.
(3) The tests will use 1970 rather than
1960 data. (4) Only white wives are included. (5) Only wives with husbands in
nonfarm occupations, rather than all occupations, are included. (6) Wives are restricted to those between the ages of 35-44,
rather than 35-54.

Discussed above are the reasons for
using family income, and for restricting the
population of wives to those who married
at age 22 or later, and who are in the labor
force. We use white wives rather than all
wives because of the known differences by
race in degree childless; blacks have continuously demonstrated higher rates of
childlessness than whites, although the
reasons for the differential are far from clear
(Bogue, 1969, pp. 724-729). We further
restrict the sample to wives with husbands
in nonfarm occupations because of the
higher rate of involuntary childlessness in
rural areas (Veevers, 1972). Using only
wives with husbands who are not farmers
puts an important contro] on childlessness.
Finally, we restrict the sample to wives
between the ages of 35-44 since childbearing is virtually complete by age 35. We are
thus examining a cohort whose childlessness
rates are not likely to be changed.

linear in form, suggesting that the highest
per cents of childlessness are found at the
lower, as well as the upper levels of the
income distribution. Couples with incomes
under $4,000 are characterized by nearly
the same degree of childlessness as couples
with annual incomes of $20,000 or more.
One interpretation for the observed
curvilinear relationship would argue that
both involuntarily and voluntarily childless wives are present in the test population.
We have noted above that the negative
relationship between income and childlessness observed by Kunz et al. (1973) applies
primarily to the involuntarily childless. We
then hypothesized that among the voluntarily childless, the relationship should be
positive. Attempts were then made to define the test population in such a way that
the presence of the involuntarily childless
would be somewhat restricted. Apparently
the efforts at separating the voluntarily
from the involuntarily childless were not
entirely successful, and hence a curvilinear
relationship was obtained. Perhaps by
imposing additional controls on the incomechildlessness relationship, we might be
better able to isolate the voluntarily from

the involuntarily childless. Wife’s educational attainment will be the first control
variable considered. Next we will control as
well for husband’s educational attainment.

The strategy of controlling for wife’s
educational attainment is followed because

wife’s education has been cited as one of

the most important factors influencing
voluntary childlessness in a population
(Bogue, 1969, p. 728). The importance of
this variable should be clear, especially in
light of the association noted earlier between career and educational attainment.
One would thus anticipate that the direction of the relationship between income and
childlessness should tend to be more positive among the highly educated wives and

less so among wives low in educational 
attainment. The reasoning behind this hypothesis is based in part on the expectation
that childlessness will tend more often to be
voluntary among the high-education wives
than among the low-education wives. And
the more we are able to separate the voluntarily childless from the involuntarily childless, the greater the likelihood that a positive relationship between family income and
voluntary childlessness will be uncovered.

groups. When we examine in Table 5 the
rank order correlation coefficients computed
from data presented in the first four tables,
it is clear that only among the high-school
graduates does the relationship between
income and childlessness approach the positive linear form hypothesized. However,
with a coefficient of 0.22, the positive relationship is at best a modest one.

Thus, only in part does the relationship
between family income and childlessness
tend to become more positive with increasing levels of wife’s educational attainment.
That is, the relationship is more positive
among wives who are high-school graduates
than among those who are not. An exception, however, are wives with one year or
more of college. For them, there is no linear
relationship between family income and
childlessness.

Income and Childlessness

 

303

So far little attention has been paid to the
husband’s level of educational attainment,
although following the line of reasoning employed when controlling for wife’s level of
educational attainment, one could argue in
a like manner for both husbands and wives
together. That is, the relationship between
income and childlessness should become
more positive among couples where both
husband and wife are high-school graduates
and less positive among couples where the
husband is a high-school graduate and the
wife is not. We will thus consider further
the family income—childlessness hypothesis,
controlling for three levels of husband’s
educational attainment along with three
levels of wife’s educational attainment.

Table 6 provides data for the first tests.
Here we examine the relationship among
couples where the husband is not a high
school graduate, and the wife is not a high
school graduate, has completed 4 years of
high school, or has completed 1 or more
years of college. As hypothesized earlier,
the relationship between family income and
childlessness should become more positive
with increases in levels of wife’s educational
attainment. The three sections of Table 6
suggest that the relationship does become
more positive, and the rank order correlation coefficients in Table 5 provide further
substantiation. The correlation between income and childlessness among couples
where the husband and the wife are not
high-school graduates is —0.32, whereas
the correlation among couples where the
husband is not a high-school graduate and
the wife has completed 1 or more years of
college is 0.71.

In Table 7 we examine the incomechildlessness relationship for husbands with
high-school educations while varying wife’s
education. Clearly there is a progression
toward a positive relationship with increases
in wife’s education, although not quite
as marked as in the earlier test. The rank

order correlation coefficients (Table 5) also

virtually no linear relationship between
family income and childlessness among
couples where the wife is not a high-school

relationship is obtained when the wife has
attended 1 or more years of college (rho =

Finally, we examine the income-childlessness relationship where the husband
has completed 1 or more years of college,
while again varying wife’s level of education by three categories. The data in

comes more positive, at least moving from
wives who have not completed high school
to those who have. The rank order correlation coefficients (Table 5) also demonstrate
this rather marked difference; the relationship is negative among wives who have
not completed high school (rko = —0.67),
and positive among wives with high school
diplomas (rho = 0.61). But if our reasoning were upheld fully, the correlation coefficients should be even higher among wives
with 1 or more years of college. It is not
only not higher in magnitude than the
correlation among wives with a high school
diploma, it is not positive either (rho =
—0.27).

A close inspection of the frequencies in
Table 8 suggests a possible reason for this
unanticipated negative relationship between
income and childlessness among couples
where both wife and husband have attended
some college. We call attention to the fact
that most of the couples are concentrated
in the upper three income categories used
in the analysis. Nearly 93 per cent of the
couples earn $10,000 or more annually. We
suggest that had it been possible to disaggregate further the income categories for
these couples, the expected positive relationship may very well have been obtained.
For that matter, the relationship between

Income and Childlessness

305

income and childlessness in these highest
three income categories is indeed positive,
as expected.

The negative relationship observed in
Tables 5 and 8 of course still applies;
among couples where both husband and
wife have attended some college, the relationship between seven categories of family
income and the per cent childless is negative. However, the fact that virtually all of
these couples are concentrated in the upper
three income categories suggests perhaps
that the negative relationship may result
from the manner in which family income
was categorized and should not necessarily
be seen as a definitive rejection of the hypothesized positive relationship between
income and voluntary childlessness.

DISCUSSION

This study was initiated as a response to
the current literature on the relationship
between income and childlessness. The
analysis by Kunz et al. (1973) is an especially good example; data were presented
suggesting the relationship to be an inverse
one, and the reasoning given to interpret
these findings dealt with only one type of
childlessness, that due to involuntary factors. Voluntary childlessness was virtually
ignored.

We examined first the extent to which
voluntary childlessness exists in the population today and concluded that childlessness
is not solely the result of involuntary factors. Indeed, if Bumpass (1973), Ryder
(1973) and Westoff (1972) are correct
about the significant changes underway in
norms and values dealing with contraceptive use, family formation, and female work
patterns and preferences, one might expect
the incidence of voluntary childlessness to
be greater today than it was a decade or
two ago,

Our next concern was with whether or
not the relationship between income and

306

voluntary childlessness would be of a different form from that observed in the study
by Kunz et al. (1973). We hypothesized
that the relationship between income and
voluntary childlessness should be direct;
that is, the highest per cent of childlessness
should be found in the upper income categories.

To test this hypothesis, we relied on
census data for an indirect examination.
The test population was defined in such a
way that the presence of the involuntarily
childless was somewhat restricted. Although
dealing with a smaller population than that
examined by Kunz and his colleagues, we
felt our population to be somewhat more
homogeneous concerning whether the childlessness resulted from choice or from involuntary factors.

We conducted a series of tests employing
recently available data from the 1970 census. The relationship between income and
childlessness was examined on a number of
levels. At first, it proved to be curvilinear
in form. Childlessness tended to be at its
highest at both the upper and lower ends of
the income distribution.

But when we attempted systematically
to separate further the voluntarily from
the involuntarily childless, the relationship
did indeed tend to become positive. For
example, as we increased wife’s level of educational attainment from “no high school,”
through “high school completed,” to “attended some college,’’ while holding constant husband’s education, the relationship
between income and childlessness became
more positive. Although these tests are
nothing more than indirect examinations of
the income and voluntary childlessness hypothesis, they do suggest at least that the
relationship need not always be a negative
one. We feel that this finding alone is an
important one. Our data suggest that in
certain subpopulations, income and childlessness are not necessarily related inversely.

Poston

Social Biology

There are doubtless many problems with
this analysis. For one, the assumptions
about the mechanisms behind the expected
positive relationship between income and
voluntary childlessness may be unacceptable to some. It could be argued, for example, that too much emphasis has been placed
upon economic and career motivations.

Another problem concerns the methodological strategy through which we attempted
to separate the voluntarily from the involuntarily childless. Perhaps the decisions
were too restrictive, or maybe they were
not restrictive enough. Surely the childless
wives found in the final test population were
not restricted to the voluntary ones, although we do feel that our population was
more homogeneous than that employed by
Kunz et al. in their recent analysis (1973).

Our findings were far from definitive confirmations of the hypothesis. They may well
have raised more questions than they answered. For example, the one group of husbands and wives where one would most
expect to observe the positive relationship
between income and childlessness are those
who attended some college. Although strong
negative relationships were not found to be
characteristic of this group, neither were
high positive ones. We suggested above that
the manner in which income was categorized may well have worked against the
expected positive relationship for this particular subgroup; but this is hardly a full
explanation. More work among childless
couples, especially the highly educated, is
clearly needed. Exploratory interviews,
much like those conducted recently by
Veevers (1973), should provide the detailed
information presently unavailable with census materials.

Whatever the problems with our analysis,
we do feel that an important question has
been addressed. It is clear that the relationship between income and childlessness is
not always an inverse one. There are cer

tain segments of the “risk” population in
which the relationship may well be positive.
While we have not provided conclusive empirical support for the existence of a positive relationship between income and voluntary childlessness, we have at least shown
that the more general relationship is not
always negative. We hope that future research on factors related to childlessness
will attempt to distinguish between volun

tary and involuntary childlessness. Since
these two groups are so qualitatively different, attempts at generalizing about one
without considering the other may well be
futile.
