Assortative Mating: A Study of
Physiognomic Homogamy

Many individuals believe that marriage
tends to induce the marriage partners to
look like one another. The question to
which this paper addresses itself is whether
people perceive that a couple looks alike
because of an actual preexisting or developed physiognomic homogamy or whether
their perception is colored by the foreknowledge that the couple is married.

The psychological process of perception
is an immediate one in which a subject
simultaneously sees distinct objects, persons, configurations, and various aspects
of continuity, contours, proportions, and
directions. For example, optical illusions
are determined for the viewer in part by
his psychological set. Further, experience
seems always to be selective, according
to the motivational bias of the subject.
Psychological selectivity illustrates this
interrelationship between motivation and
cognition, and between “effective” and
“intellectual” processes (Sherif and Sherif,
1956). However, Cline and Richards in
1960 conducted a somewhat more complicated study of interpersonal relationships
and rather surprisingly concluded that
“there is a general ability to perceive
others accurately. This particular general
ability, however, consists of (at least) two

independent parts: sensitivity to the Generalized Other, and Interpersonal Sensitivity” (p. 6).

Since sincere people commonly assert
that married people “look alike,” the questions may be asked: Do married persons
look alike to begin with? Do they grow
to look alike? Or, is the “likeness,” simply a perceived phenomenon which can be
correctly attributed to the “eye of the
beholder’?

Freud presented the Oedipus selection
concept of parent-substitution in mating,
but no clear evidence has been produced.
Sometimes there is physiognomic homogeneity between a man’s wife and his
mother or between a woman’s husband
and her father, but apparently these instances are coincidental, occurring no
more frequently than by chance (Eckland,
1968). J. Richard Udry (1966), Anselm
Strauss (1946), and others have investigated the idea “I want a girl just like the
girl that married dear old Dad” and failed
to find sufficient evidence that ideal mate
image actually influenced ultimate mate
selection.

In August, 1957, Evans’ interview of
Dr. Jung revealed agreement and disagreement with Freud relative to psychosexual

development. The expansion of the Oedipal

complex as an example of archetype was |

expressed this way by Jung (Evans, 1964,

p. 49):
... man has, of course, an inherited scheme
of functioning which (is) expressed in the
form of archetype forms .... You see,
the archetype is a force. It has an autonomy, and it can suddenly seize you. It is
like a seizure. So, for instance, falling in
love at first sight, that is such a case. You
have a certain image in yourself without
knowing it, of the woman—a good imitation
of your type, and instantly you get the
seizure; you are caught....

So psychologically inherited is your
mate, Jung claims, that you instantly
know when you see “her” that you should
marry. However, so far as can be statistically stated at this point, there are no
known physiognomic determining tendencies toward homogamously assortative
mating.

J. N. Spuhler (1968) published a survey
of the results of other researchers concerning the biological traits and physical characteristics of married couples with their
estimates of the degrees of association.
Of the 105 characteristics listed, Spuhler
(1968, p. 128) notes that “aside from the
‘age’ and ‘age at...’ characters, none of
the associations . . . are strong” (our
italics).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Over three-hundred college students
were presented discrete head and shoulder
pictures of five randomly matched couples
of various specific durations of marriage
to determine if marriage partners look
alike close to their time of marriage and
if they look more alike as years of marriage
increase. In the study it was not feasible
to procure pictures of proper quality of the
same couple at the marriage date and subsequent anniversaries. Such a procedure
would be very useful, however. We opted

Physiognomic Homogamy

. 449

to use a cross-sectional set of pictures of
couples at various years of marriage.

Individual head and shoulder pictures
of the married couples were taken of some
residents of a small city in Utah who were
in the middle socioeconomic bracket and
who were willing to participate in such a
study. Pictures were taken at the same
time but each in a different frame. Tri-X
film was used. A common plain background
was used to control for any matching problems. The subjects were asked to look
pleasant but natural so that no “posing”
took place. Available lighting was used so
that natural contrasting densities could
be captured photographically.

Six groups of five couples each were
used. In order to determine if there was
any progressive growing to look alike, the
sample was divided into the following categories: (1) less than one year of marriage;
(2) approximately five years of marriage;
(3) approximately 10 to 15 years of marriage; (4) approximately 15 to 20 years of
marriage; (5) approximately 25 years of
marriage; and (6) approximately 35 years
of marriage. The couples whose pictures
were used had been married only once.
The members’ ages within each group were
homogeneous with a variance of not more
than two years. The couples were of similar
socioeconomic status, so that hair styling
and dress quality were controlled. The pictures, grouped in sets of ten, were displayed
on a screen by an overhead projector. The
judges were told that the people were married and that we were interested in having
them match those men and women whom
they thought looked as if they were married to one another. No other information
was given.

In order to obtain the expectations for
each of the frequencies for correct matches,
it was necessary to compute the probability
of getting correct matches from zero
through five. William Feller (1968) gave

the following probabilities for N = 5 in
probability of correct matching and guessing problems: Pp = 0.367, Py = 0.375,
P, = 0.167, Ps = 0.083, Ps = 0.000, and
Ps = 0.008.

FINDINGS

Three hundred and five college students
completed score sheets. Of these, 295 were
used for the data in this study. The other

10 score sheets were coded improperly by
the judges and were therefore not used.
The number of judges in each age group
was as follows: 16 to 19 years, 70; 20 to
25 years, 185; 26 to 30 years, 30; 31 to 35
years, 6; 36 to 45 years, 4. There were 170
males and 125 females. Of these, 226 were
single and 69 were married.

rect matches by judges for couples married
less than one year indicates that 13%
fewer wrong responses were made in the
zero row of correct matches than was expected by chance. The one row of correct
matches was equal to chance. The 2, 3, and
5 rows matched correctly were significantly
more than could be expected by chance,
with 2 being the highest difference. This
would appear to indicate that at least
half of the couples are physiognomically
homogamous,

For couples married approximately 5
years, the relationship between observed
and expected frequencies of correct matches
by the judges shows that in 0 and 1 rows
fewer wrong responses were made than was
expected by chance. In the 2, 3, and 5 rows,

again, the matches were considerably more

than can be expected by chance, with the
3 rows of correct responses being the highest correlation. This would seem to indicate
that there is a growing-to-look alike, physiognomically, as the years of marriage
increase.

However, when we examine the couples
of approximately 10 to 15 years of marriage
and compare the observed and expected
frequencies of correct matches, there is a
considerable drop in the observed over the
expected frequencies, although it is only
a negative 0.2% to a positive 1.6% difference. There is no significant difference
between the observed frequencies and that
expected by chance. Therefore, we cannot
say that there is a continuing trend toward
physiognomic homogamy.

For couples married approximately 15
to 20 years, the relationship between observed and expected frequencies of correct
matches is only slightly better than that
shown in the previous table for those
couples married approximately 10 to 15
years. The difference of correct matches
ranges from a negative 0.8% to a positive
2.2%. Some sociologists have noted that

beginning around the ninth year of marriage, the quality of marital satisfaction
decreases (Clark, 1965; Blood and Wolfe,
1960).

For those couples married from 20 to
25 years, a very significant departure from
that expected by chance is indicated. 0 and
1 rows are well below chance expectations
and 2, 3, and 5 rows are well above expectations and range from a positive 6.35%
to 18.4%. This appears to indicate physiognomic homogamy.

For those couples who have been married
for 35 years or more, the relationship between observed and expected frequencies
of correct matches by judges shows the
significance is at the 0.05 level. The
difference is from a negative 0.8% to a
positive 5.13%.

tive sign indicates that there is an inverse
relationship, but, since the amount is so
small, it cannot be considered significant.

DISCUSSION

The evidence apparently indicates that
most couples that marry have some physiognomic homogamy. The correct matches
by judges on couples in the first years of
marriage support this position. This study
does not support the first hypothesis that
the. actual matches would be the same as
or fewer than those which could be expected by chance. It does indicate (1) that
people either seek out those who look like
themselves; or (2) that, if the engagement
period is of any length, the process of
physiognomic homogamy has _ already
started. The latter hypothesis could be
tested by obtaining pictures of engaged
couples and including them in the procedures herein described.

There is a peculiar disuniformity in the
overall trend toward physiognomic homogeneity. There is a definite drop in the
significance of matches for couples married
between 10 and 20 years. There are factors
which could contribute to what we might
term here a “‘negative physiognomic trend”
in marriage. These are the child-rearing
years, in which much energy is devoted to
the children, to separate social activities,
and noé to each other. The father, in particular, earning a livelihood, may be in
volved much more with his work life than
his home life. The ninth year and on
(during child rearing) are considered the
hardest for the marriage partners. With
lack of communication probably involved,
there may be a tendency toward ever deepening, opposing attitudes, and perhaps,
even antagonistic behavior patterns which
could lead to physical changes.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

When asking if people who are married
look alike, one must also define what is
meant by “looking alike.” Does the definition entail only physiognomic homogamy
or do sociologically acquired traits of married couples add to one’s projection of
homogamy ?

There have been numerous studies since
1840 which have dealt with three general
areas of assortative mating. First, exact
measurements have been made on almost
every physical characteristic (except physiognomy as defined herein). Second, the
psychological traits of marriage partners
have been measured. Third, sociological
factors of monogamous marriages have been
investigated. None of these studies has
dealt with the question of physiognomic
homogamy, which indeed could be the
most effective predicator of all.

The inclination of the human mind to
seek balance has been studied by several

researchers. They have found that interaction with others can change attitudes
and behavior. Between marriage partners,
close interaction and a desire to achieve
unity can and does modify the individual’s
behavior and, possibly, ostensible physiognomical modifications occur (for an opposing view, see Knussmann, 1961).
Given pictures of couples at various
stages of marriage, individuals were asked
to match up partners. The findings indicate
that there is physiognomic homogamy for
married couples from marriage through approximately ten years. The years from 10
to 20 do not show physiognomic homogamy
of any significance. The couples married
20 years and more again show a significant
physiognomic homogamy as demonstrated
by the number of correct matches. It is the

Physiognomic Homogamy

453

conclusion of this paper that there is indeed physiognomic homogamy among married couples (only one marriage era shows
digression in detected physiognomic homogamy), but that there appears to be no
significant trend in growing to look alike
as persons live together as husband and
wife.

Future studies should use more couples
at each stage of marriage so that the judges
have greater opportunity to make mistakes.
Secondly, pictures might be obtained from
couples for various points in their married
lives and pictures prior to marriage might
be obtained from school year books. Physiognomy among engaged couples could also
be tested in this manner. It is hoped that
further research along these lines will
follow.
