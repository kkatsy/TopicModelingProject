ABSTRACT: This study examines the social and biologica) determinants of age at first marriage
in two townships in northern Taiwan, one very rural and traditional and the other urban and
modernized. For a sample of 5,707 once-married women a path analysis was performed in
which age at first marriage was considered a function of age, educational attainment, urban
origin, premarital labor-force participation, and age at menarche. Age at menarche, with a
positive effect on the dependent variable, was the most important direct cause of age at first
marriage. Although exogenous variables associated with modernization (urban origin, educational attainment and younger age) had a positive direct effect on age at first marriage, they also
had a negative indirect effect on age at first marriage through their negative direct effect on age

at menarche.

There is a broad body of literature
which addresses the question, ““What
are the determinants of age at first marriage for women?” Most research has
focused on the effects of socioeconomic
factors including educational achievement, socioeconomic status, labor force
participation, urban vs rural residence,
religion and ethnicity. By and large, researchers have neglected to include the
influences of biological factors on the
age of first marriage. Clearly, there is a
relationship between these socioeconomic factors and one’s nutritional
state; this, in turn, will influence a girl’s
maturation rate and general development. —

Especially in traditional societies,
like Taiwan, sexual behavior is generally associated with marriage. Since sexual behavior is most often initiated after
puberty, marriage for females usually
occurs after menarche. Again, in traditional societies most particularly, one of
the primary functions of marriage is re
production, which for the female requires the maturation of the hormonal
system and the initiation of the menstrual cycle. This is not to say that menarche is a necessary prerequisite to sexual behavior or marriage. Rather, in a
society in which the reproductive function is emphasized, the appearance of
menstruation becomes an important
sign of suitability for marriage and
motherhood. In such a cultural environment, females with later menarche will
tend to marry later than those whose
menarche appears earlier.

No matter how traditional, Taiwan is
also in the process of modernization.
Modernization may be defined as socioeconomic development and technological improvement. The experience of
modernization, in general, tends to increase urbanization and educational attainment. On the one hand, increments
in urbanization and educational attainment lead to a decrease in age at first
marriage. On the other hand, both mod

ernization and urbanization imply the
improvement of daily diet and nutritional state which lead to an early age at
menarche. This suggests that modernization may have both negative and positive effects on age at marriage and that
failure to take account of biological mediators of modernization has resulted in
an underestimate of modernization’s direct effect on nuptial behavior.

Because this paper is concerned with
the determinants of age at first marriage
for women, it is important to consider
both the social and biological factors
which may be influential. The biological
influence of interest in this case is age at
menarche, and the social factors included in the analysis are: present age,
urban vs rural residence, years of
schooling and labor force participation
before marriage. The available literature supports the inclusion of these variables.

LITERATURE REVIEW

The relationship between age at
menarche and age at marriage has been
explored in only a few studies (Buck and
Stavraky, 1967; Chowdhury et al.,
1977). Buck and Stavraky (1967) found
a significant positive correlation between age at menarche and age at marriage in a study of 51,490 women of
childbearing age in the ten teaching hospitals of the province of Ontario in
1960-61. They argued that age at menarche is an important factor in age at first
marriage “if the rate of maturation if
fundamentally correlated with psychological characteristics which could influence a woman’s readiness or opportunity for marriage.’”” Women who
experienced menarche early tended to
marry at earlier ages.

Social Biology

Chowdhury et al (1977) have investigated a somewhat different aspect of
this issue. In their study of 1,155 girls
from Bangladesh aged 10 through 20,
they assessed the effect of childhood nutrition on the onset of menarche, and
the correlation between age at menarche and the age at marriage. In addition
to the analyses of nutritional effects,
Chowdhury et al. found that the proportion of ever-married girls was much
higher among those who had experienced menarche than among those who
had not. “However, for nonmenarcheal
girls, the proportion of ever-married is
low for all age groups and shows only a
slight increase as age increases’’
(Chowdhury et al., 1977, p. 322). This
finding suggests that the age of menarche is an important variable when considering the determinants of age of first
marriage for women.

Additionally, Udry (1979) examined
specifically the relationships of age at
menarche with age at first intercourse
and age at first pregnancy. From Udry’s
study it is not possible to conclude directly that age at menarche and age of
marriage are related. However, he did
find that early intercourse and early
pregnancy are related to menarche at an
earlier age. Undoubtedly, marriage is
still the most socially approved means of
sexual gratification within most cultures. In almost all societies, a legal
child is born only through legal marriage. Often, to avoid illegitimate birth,
pregnant women will get married before
the baby is born. Also, married women
tend to have more frequent coitus and
thus tend to be pregnant earlier. On this
assumption, then, early menarche is
probably associated with early marriage.

Besides being correlated with biolog‘40 08 December 2015

ical maturity, women’s age at first marriage is correlated with their socioeconomic background. There are a number
of studies which examine the socioeconomic determinants of age at first marriage in Third World nations. Many of
these, e.g., Dixon (1971), Smith (1975a,
1975b, 1980), and Schultz (1980) are
analyses for areas in which the mean age
at marriage is correlated with other variables pertaining to the area. Only a few
studies relate age at first marriage for individuals with other individual variables
in a multivariate analysis. We shall summarize three such studies for Third
World nations.

Balakrishnan (1976) studied the age
at first marriage of women from four
Latin American countries. He found

that women’s age at first marriage in
creased with the level of urbanization
and education. Those with at least some
secondary education married more than
two years later than those with no education. Also, women who were raised in
an urban area from early childhood
married later.

Von Elm and Hirschman (1979) examined the socioeconomic determinants of the age at first marriage among
women aged 25-44, in Peninsular Malaysia in 1966-1967. They found that age
at first marriage was related to ethnicity
differences and was positively associated with years of formal schooling, premarital work experience, urban origin,
and having a nonfarm (particularly a
white collar) father.

Lee (1982) also examined the determinants of age at first marriage in peninsular Malaysia but with a sample from a
later year, 1974, and with a more elaborate path analysis. He found positive direct effects on age at first marriage of urban origin, educational level, premarital

Age at First Marriage in Taiwan 117

work experience, and premarital work
duration. However, the indirect effects
of educational attainment on age at first
marriage through premarital work status and premarital work duration were
found to be very small.

There has also been some research
on the determinants of age at menarche.
Studies have documented a progressive
lowering of the age at menarche in many
societies, especially in the United States
and Western Europe. Damon et al.
(1969) have pointed out that since the
nineteenth century, age of menarche
has declined three or four months per
decade, or about one year per generation in many Western societies. They
concluded that the age at menarche is
now 2.5 to 3.5 years earlier than it was a
century ago. They argue that these
changes are due to better nutrition, improved health conditions, and some asyet-unidentified aspects of the material
and psychosocial environment (Damon
et al., 1969).

There are also regional differences.
Exploring the mean age of menarche in
urban and rural areas of India,
Madhavan (1965) found a difference of
1.40 years between urban and rural areas. In urban areas the mean age at
menarche was 12.76 years, while that in
rural areas was 14.16 years of age.
Madhavan argues that socioeconomic
conditions are usually better in urban areas, and therefore a discrepancy such as
this often occurs in developing countries.

Frisch and Reveille (1970) hypothesized that menarche 1s dependent on the
maintenance of a minimum weight for
height representing a critical fat storage.
Zacharias et al. (1976) reported a significant positive correlation between what
they called the “‘ponderal index” (a

function of height and weight) and age
at menarche. It was suggested that a
woman’s age at menarche is strongly associated with body build. Late menarche is related with thinness and early
menarche with heaviness.

From a review of the literature, all of
the studies of women’s age at first marriage are seen to focus either on the effect of biological factors or on the influence of the socioeconomic realities in
the lives of women, but none focuses on
both biological and sociological factors
simultaneously. As the previous research efforts have shown, both socioeconomic background and age at menarche are related to age at marriage. It is
clearly important to consider both socioeconomic and biological influences on
the age of women at first marriage. This
is the basic purpose of this paper.

One important point to note is that
when treating year of birth, urban residence, and educational attainment as indicators of modernization, negative indirect paths might be found between
each of these variables and age at first
marriage via age at menarche. In other
words, modernization might tend to
lower age at menarche and thus indirectly lower the age at first marriage as
well. This indirect path from modernization to age at first marriage via age at
menarche might counteract, at least in
part, a direct positive path between
modernization and age at first marriage.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data for this paper are drawn from
Heer and Wu’s 1969-1970 Taiwan survey, which was purposely designed for
assessing the effects of infant and child
mortality and preference for sons upon
fertility and family planning behavior

Social Biology

and attitudes in Taiwan (Heer and Wu,
1975). The interviewing was conducted
in two small townships near Taipei city:
Kungliao and Hsinchuang. The former
is a small fishing area of about 19,000 inhabitants. Most of the employed men
are fishermen. The latter is an urbanizing factory area with about 43,000 inhabitants, and most of the employed
men are farmers or factory workers.
Kungliao was selected for the study because it had a very high level of infant
and child mortality, while Hsinchuang
was selected because it had a very low
level of infant and child mortality. Additionally, Hsinchuang rated higher on all
measures of modernization than Kugliao.

About 5,707 married women who
had ever-married but had married only
once were included in this study.
Among them, those who lived in
Kungliao in the time of survey are here
classified as rural residents, while those
who lived in Hsinchuang are treated as
urban residents.

As mentioned before, this study focuses on the social and biological causes
of women’s age at first marriage. Five independent variables are used: Age
(AGE) is defined in single years by subtracting the birth date from the survey
date. Age at menarche (AAM) refers to
the age at which the woman reported
she began menstruating and is defined in
single years. There may be some question about the accuracy of the age recorded for the age at menarche, because
this was given retrospectively. However, according to Livson and McNeill’s
panel study of 43 American women who
were born in the late 1920’s, it 1s shown
that, for this specific information, there
is only a 0.50 year variation between the
actual age at menarche and the recalled

age (Livson and McNeill, 1962). Educational attainment (ED) is measured in
single years of schooling.

Premarital labor force participation
(PMLFP) is based on response to the
questions: “‘Have you ever taken a job
outside the home either before or after
marriage? If so, do you presently have a
job outside the home?” It was coded as
0 if the answer was “‘never’’ and | otherwise. Although the questions is ambiguous regarding time (previous means before marriage or earlier in the
marriage), the researchers concluded
that since the cultural restrictions regarding female labor force participation
after marriage in Taiwan are so strong
almost all previous employment occurred before marriage. Hence, there
would be only a slight discrepancy between a positive answer to the question
and actual premarital labor force participation.

Urban vs rural residence (RES) was
coded according to residence at the time
of responding to the questionnaire.
Based on the level of urbanization,
Kungliao was classified as a rural area
and was coded as 0, while Hsingchuang
was classified as an urban area and was
coded as 1,

On the basis of previous studies, the
following hypotheses are posed:

1. There will be a positive direct path
to age at first marriage from the variables of age at menarche, premarital labor force participation, educational attainment, and urban residence. There
will also be a negative direct path between current age and age at first marriage. This last negative path will translate into a positive path of equal
magnitude between year of birth and
age at first marriage.

2. There will be a negative direct path

  

   

Age at First Marriage in Taiwan 119

to age at menarche from the variables of

educational attainment and urban residence. There will also be a positive direct path from current age to age at
menarche which translates into a negative direct path of equal magnitude from
year of birth to age at menarche.

3. There will be a negative direct path
to premarital labor force participation
from the variables of current age and urban residence. There will be a positive
direct path from educational attainment
to premarital labor force participation.

4. There will be a negative direct path
from current age and urban residence to
educational attainment.

Since age at menarche itself may be
affected by social factors, a path analysis
is undertaken to see how these five independent variables interrelate to determine women’s age at first marriage. In
this model, women’s age at menarche is
determined by age cohort, residence,
and educational attainment (which is
treated as an important index of socioeconomic status). Premarital labor force
participation is decided by educational
attainment, age, cohort, and residence.
While educational attainment itself may
be influenced by several factors, in this
model only age and residence are considered,

Another matter which should be explained here is that in the path diagram,
there is a direct negative path between
education and age at menarche. This
does not mean that the effect of more
education is earlier menarche. However, it does mean that high socioeconomic status is hypothesized to cause
early menarche and that educational attainment is used here as an index of so
cioeconomic status in the family of origin. Admittedly, causation might run
the other way if education is the alterna

tive to marriage for pre-menarcheal
girls. However, in that case the effect
would have to be positive rather than
negative.

RESULTS

The means and standard deviations
of each of the six variables for the combination of the two townships and for
each township separately are shown in
Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the mean
age of first marriage in the two townships is 19.65. In the urban township of
Hsinchuang women tend to marry some
1.76 years later than in the rural township of Kungliao where the mean age of
first marriage is 18.54.

Table 2 shows the matrix of zeroorder correlation coefficients among the
six variables for the two townships combined and for each township separately.
The following correlations are notable:
(1) Current age is correlated negatively
with age at first marriage. (2) Current
age is correlated positively with age at
menarche. (3) Females living in the urban area tend to marry later than those
in the rural area. (4) Females living in
the urban area tend to have menarche

earlier. (5) The mean age at first marriage is positively correlated with educational attainment. (6) The mean age at
menarche is negatively correlated with
educational attainment. (7) Women
with some work experience tend to
marry later than those who have never
worked. (8) The mean age at menarche
is positively correlated with the mean
age of first marriage.

Tables 3 through 6 examine in detail
the relation between each of the independent variables and age at first marriage. The purpose 1s to ascertain
whether each of these variables is indeed linearly related to the dependent
variable.

Table 3 shows that the mean age of
first marriage exhibits a steady decline
with increasing age except for the cohort
of women who were under 30 years old.
Women who were 30 to 39 years of age
tended to marry about two years later
than those who were more than 60 years
old. Contrary to the original hypothesis,
women less than 20 years old married
earlier than women from other age cohorts. This was probably the result of
truncation bias. In other words, many
women who were under 20 years of age

for this group (20.61) is 1.54 years later

In this study, one of the most interesting findings is the relationship of age at
menarche to age at marriage. Given the
positive correlation coefficient of 0.11, a
linear model shows the age at first mar
riage increases when the age of menarche goes up.

under age 12 marry later than those who
first menstruated at 12 to 19 years old.
This exception could be merely the
result of sampling error (the number of
cases is very small) or due to the effects
of age, residence, and education. As
mentioned before, younger generation
females tend to have their menarche
earlier, yet they tend to marry later than
older generation females. Similarly, urban women who have their menarche at
an earlier age also tend to marry later
than their rural counterparts. The same
is true for highly educated females.
Those latter represent, generally, a
higher socioeconomic status. They tend
to have earlier menarche, yet they also
marry at a later age.

The results for the postulated model
are shown in Figure 1. Table 7 presents a
more complete description of the
results, including both unstandardized
and standardized regression coefficients
and the values of R? for each equation.
As shown in Table 7, the multiple regression on the dependent variable, age
at first marriage, using the five indepen
dent variables yields an R? of 0.1821.
That is, about 18 per cent of the variance
in age at first marriage is accounted for
by age, urban vs. rural residence, educational attainment, premarital work experience, and age at menarche.

Relative to other determinants, age
at menarche appears to have the greatest direct impact on age at marriage (Beta=0.240). The others in order of variable strength are urban vs. rural
residence (Beta=0.218); educational
attainment (Beta=0.209); premarital
work experience (Beta=0.097); and
age (Beta= —0.045). In other words, at
least before 1970 in Taiwan, age at menarche had the most dominant effect on
the variation of age at first marriage,
whereas cohort membership exerted the
smallest effect.

The minimal effect of cohort membership suggests that in spite of the economic growth experienced by the Taiwanese, the cultural attitudes in Taiwan
remain traditional. The values embraced by a majority of the people, men
and women alike, were that the woman

is, essentially, a childbearer and
childraiser. These functions, along with
service to her husband and subservience
to her mother-in-law, formed her contribution to society (Wolf, 1972). According to traditional Chinese culture patterns, a Chinese woman lives with her
husband in the home of his family of origin upon marriage. The appearance of
menarche is a clear indication that a
woman is prepared to assume her childbearing role. Her socialization within
her family of origin should assume that
she is prepared to be a mother and an

otherwise dutiful wife and daughter-inlaw.

Formal education for women is not
considered valuable in such traditional
Chinese societies. It is the mother’s task
to socialize her daughters to be good
wives and mothers and dutiful
daughters-in-law. The data themselves
emphasize the low priority of education
for women since the mean number of
years of schooling for the women in the
total sample is 3.54 years (for urban
women, 4.54 years; and for rural
women, 1.80 years). In fact, traditional

Chinese ideology affirms that “ignorance is a virtue for women’’. To have an
educated wife sometimes does not provide happiness for her husband because
a knowledgeable wife has too many
ideas of her own. Such a woman ts hard
“to control,” according to traditional
Chinese thought. It should be noted that
urban women have more than twice as
much education as rural women, so that
the traditional Chinese wisdom regarding women is slowly giving way to modernization.

As shown in Figure 1, premarital labor force participation is directly influenced by age, residence, and education. The path correlation coefficients
are —0.182, 0.295, and 0.283, respectively. That is, older women rarely
worked before marriage. The same is
true for the rural women, while welleducated women tended to have premarital work experience. Education, as
Figure 1 shows, is directly influenced by
age and residence, the path correlation
coefficients are —0.376 and 0.345, respectively. This may be interpreted to
mean that older women and rural
women are usually less well educated.

Age at menarche, as Figure 1 shows,
is influenced by age, residence, and educational attainment (which is the index
of socioeconomic status). The path coefficients are 0.108, —0.156, and —0.167,
respectively. These coefficients imply
that young urban females with high educational attainment tend to have menarche at an earlier age. However, young
age, urban residence, and high educational attainment are all indicators of
modernization. In other words, modernization tends to lower the age at menarche.

The positive direct path between age
at menarche and age at first marriage

 

Social Biology

implies that females with earlier menarche tend to marry earlier. Accordingly,
we have shown that modernization variables have a negative indirect path to
age at first marriage via age at menarche.

CONCLUSION

In the past, social factors determining
age at first marriage have been emphasized. Age at menarche has been given
less attention. The Taiwanese data analyzed has been given less attention. The
Taiwanese data analyzed in this study
show the significance of this biological
variable as a predictor of age at first marriage for women.

The data analysis indicates that this
biological factor is interrelated with socioeconomic influences as predictors of
age at first marriage. Older cohorts of
women tended to marry about two years
earlier than did the women below 30
years old considered in this study. The
mean age at first marriage for urban
women is 1.76 years later than that
for rural women. There is a steadily increasing age at marriage as educational
levels for women increase. There is a
four year differential in age at first marriage between those who have no formal
education and those who have completed at least 12 years of schooling.
Similarly, women who worked before
marriage married later than those who
had never worked (20.61 years of age
and 19.07 years of age, respectively).

A study such as this reemphasizes
that in Taiwan, as elsewhere, there is a
complex interplay of socioeconomic,
and biological factors embedded within
a cultural context which influences age
at first marriage for females. This is particularly true in societies in developmenDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

tal transition where increasing industrialization and modernization are
influencing urbanization and, therefore,
women’s educational attainment. These
factors also influence levels of nutrition
which affect age at menarche.

Treating later birth year (i.e. younger
age), urban residence, and higher education level as the indicators of modernization, negative paths were found between the indicators of modernization
and age at menarche, leading to a number of indirect paths from the modernization variables to age at first marriage.
These indirect negative paths are contradictory to the previously-mentioned
hypotheses that modernization variables are positively related to age at first
marriage. Nevertheless, the several indirect negative paths from the modernization variables to age at first marriage
via age at menarche are all minute in
magnitude compared to the direct and
indirect positive paths between modernization and age at first marriage. For example, the direct paths from age cohort,
residence, and educational attainment
to age at marriage are 0.045, 0.218, and
0.209, respectively, while their indirect

Age at First Marriage in Taiwan 127

paths to age at marriage via age at menarche are —0.026, —0.037, —0.040, respectively). Hence are derived the obtained positive correlation coefficients
between the various modernization variables and age at first marriage.

Further research should continue to
look at the interrelationships among the
socioeconomic and biological variables
includes in this research. In addition,
whenever possible, measures of the persistence or decline of the traditional role
expectations for women in Taiwan or
the transition culture under consideration should be included. It is reasonable to assume that in a developing
country these interrelationships will
themselves change as the society
changes.
