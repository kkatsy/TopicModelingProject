Individual Fertility Rate:
A New Individual Fertility Measure
for Small Populations

ABSTRACT: Fertility measurement in small preindustrial societies is hampered by small
numbers and the lack of some essential data. Most measures of fertility are collective and
require large enough populations to permit grouped data analysis. Existing individual
measures of fertility are often unsatisfactory. This paper presents a new measure of individual
fertility, the Individual Fertility Rate (IFR), which is constructed by dividing parity by
reproductive span in years and multiplying the product by 100. The result is a number which
may be used as a dependent individual or cumulative variable to study the effects of health and

socioeconomic factors on fertility.

Fertility measurement in small preindustrial societies is constrained by many
factors, among which are small numbers
and lack of some essential data. Ages
are sometimes unknown or approximate, particularly for older individuals.
Large aggregates of demographic data
of the type easily available in urban societies do not exist. Data for demographic
analyses are collected by ethnographic
techniques including household interviews and narratives (Caldwell, et al.,
1988; Hull et al., 1988; Vlassoff, 1988;
Das Gupta, 1988). Data thus collected
in the only manner possible are often
spectacularly untidy. Birth records are
sometimes available, but they are not always reliable. In preliterate societies,
the ethnographer must make estimates
of age (Howell, 1979, p. 123). These are
sometimes quite accurate if they are the
result of extended observations, but
even then, age groupings are often
broader than are usually acceptable for
demographic analysis (Chagnon et al.,
1985, p. 196). The “own-child” method
of fertility estimation requires assump
tions that are not likely to be true in
small populations: a moderately low
proportion of “‘other than own” children in the household; infant and maternal mortality are insignificant; the number of children not living with their
mothers is negligible; and low rates of
migration during the estimation period
(Rindfuss and Sweet, 1977, p. 11; Retherford and Cho, 1978, p. 568; Cho et
al., 1986, pp. 6-7).

In gathering data in Peru for the purpose of studying the effects of cultural
change on Shipibo Indian fertility, I
found that I could make reasonably accurate age estimates of offspring and
thereby calculate birth intervals for each
reproductive age woman. I also found
that I could ascertain, through consultations with interviewees and family members, the number of reproductive events
such as live births, stillbirths, and spontaneous abortions. These data were often more ascertainable than actual ages
of reproductive age women or their ages
at first or later marriage.

A key part of the research objective

102

was to correlate individual fertility with
certain demographic and cultural classifications such as age, residence, and
type of marriage. Part of the reason for
this was to control for confounding effects on community fertility as measured
by standard fertility indices such as General Fertility Rate and Total Fertility
Rate. Completed Fertility was not useful since most women in the study were
premenopausal. Parity alone did not
convey the fertility experience of an individual woman since she may have had
few or many pregnancies over a given
period of time. There were no standard
demographic or reproductive health indices of.individual fertility which were
available or suitable for my purpose
(Shryok, 1976, p. 274; Spiegelman,
1968, p. 254). This paper reports the
construction of a new method for measuring individual fertility, the Individual
Fertility Rate.

The specific hypothesis which I
wished to test in my research was
whether a declining prevalence of polygyny resulted in higher individual and
community fertility among the Shipibo
Indians of Peru, a group which I have
studied since 1964 (Hern, 1977).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Shipibo Indians of eastern Peruvian Amazon area are a riverine Panoan
group with settlements along a 600kilometer portion of the Ucayali River
from Atalaya to Contamana (Lathrap,
1970; Bergman, 1980). Earlier studies
indicated that, in spite of the knowledge
and use of herbal contraceptives, they
were experiencing exceedingly high fertility (Hern, 1976, 1977). Studies done
in 1964 and 1969 indicated that the Shipibo in one village experienced a General Fertility Rate of 0.305, Total Fertil
 

Individual Fertility Rate 103

ity Rate of 9.935, and a Gross
Reproduction Rate of 4.933 (Hern,
1977). The annual Rate of Natural Increase was 4.89 per cent. The current
study focused on causes of this high fertility with particular attention drawn to
the declining role of polygyny in fertility
control.

METHODS

Data were collected over a 14-month
period in 1983 and 1984 by universal
household survey of eight Shipibo Indian villages on the Ucayali and Pisqui
Rivers of eastern Peru. The ‘head of
each household was interviewed to obtain basic demographic data, and a reproductive history was obtained for
each female age 13 years or more. Exact
ages were recorded wherever possible
through the use of birth registration and
baptism certificates and by family reckoning where documents were not available.

In analyzing my data, I constructed
three individual variables for use in data
analysis. MEANINT is an arithmetic
mean of birth interval lengths experienced by each woman. PROPOLY is
the “proportion of polygynous birth intervals” for each woman, a value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. A woman who has
been monogamously married throughout her reproductive experience would
have a PROPOLY value of 0.0. A senior wife in a polygynous marriage might
have a PROPOLY of 0.9 or 0.8 if she experienced term births prior to arrival of
the junior wives. A junior wife is likely
to have a PROPOLY of 1.0.

The formula for the specific variable
constructed to measure individual fertility, the Individual Fertility Rate (IFR),
is:

where
P =parity
RS = months of reproductive

span in years.

Parity is defined as the number of term
births and reproductive span is defined
as the time in months, divided by 12,
from the first birth to the last.1

A woman having three children in
three years would have an IFR of 100; a
woman having three children over a period of eight years would have an IFR of
51.3.

Term births” is used here to mean that a term
or near-term delivery of a viable fetus has occurred
whether the birth was live or stillborn.

This formula is empirically derived in order to
arrive at a range of values that are meaningful and
can be manipulated in mathematical equations.
The denominator, for example, is in years, because using reproductive span in months would
result in extremely small products (0.03, for example) that would be distorted by a large multiplicand.

with a median of 49.1 (Figure 1). The
cumulative IFR for all the women of
each village was calculated and ranged
from 44.80 to 63.75 (Table 1). IFR is a
continuous variable, but it may be made
dichotomous by computation of a secondary variable, FERTCAT, which
separates those categorized as Low Fertility (FR = 0-45) from those with
High Fertility IFR = 45+).

The arbitrary FERTCAT classification permitted, in this case, discriminant

analysis which yielded 86 members of
FERTCAT = 1 and 149 members of
FERTCAT = 2. The classification used
resulted in correct classification of 72.1
per cent of Group 1 and 93.3 per cent of
Group 2 with an overall correct classification of 85.5 per cent (Table 2).

To test further the characteristics and
usefulness of the Individual Fertility
Rate, I have constructed two simulated
populations of 100 individuals, each

ductive spans ranging from 0.75 to 30
years (Remington and Schork, 1970, p.
358). In one population, the parities
were drawn from a random table of
numbers with a mean of 2 and standard
deviation of 1 (Dixon and Massey, 1957,
p. 452) in order to approximate a Western industrial population. In the other,
the parities were drawn from a random
table of numbers ranging from 0 to 9
(Downie and Heath, 1965, p. 316).

In the first population (Figure 2), beginning with a normally distributed
mean parity of 2.0, the mean IFR for 96
valid cases was 18.595, the median was
13.001, and the standard deviation was
17.549.3 IFR values ranged from 1.154

3Due to elimination of outliers beyond possible
values in a real population, the actual mean parity
for this group (valid N = 96) was 2.144 with a median of 2.20; mode, 1.4; s.e., 0.93; s.d., 0.910; kurtosis, —0.314; skewness, 0.099; minimum, 0.10;
maximum, 4.2. Reproductive span actual mean

to 90. Standard error was 1.791; kurtosis, 5.822; and skewness, 2.299.

In the second population (valid
N = 89), with parities ranging from 0 to
9 (Figure 3), the actual mean parity was
4,225 with a median of 4.0 and standard
deviation of 2.93.4 For this group, IFR
values ranged from 0 to 90.756 with a
mean of 26.929 and median of 24.407;
standard deviation was 21.789; standard
error, 2.31.

These simulated populations show
lower fertility than the real-life study
population of Shipibo women, a result
consistent with the high recorded community fertility among the Shipibo.

In order to test further the concept of
an Individual Fertility Rate, I drew
upon the reproductive histories of the
first 504 of 1,323 individuals in the Com
‘Mean reproductive span in years for this
group was 17.67; median, 16.667; mode, 13.417;
s.e., 0.714; s.d., 6.735; kurtosis, —0.107; skewness, 0.212; minimum, 6.33; maximum, 29.837.

ponents of Effective Fertility Regulation (CEFR) study (Helbig et al., 1987).
The IFR as used for the Shipibo population could not be applied because so few
CEFR women had experienced more
than one term birth. In fact, only 31 per
cent of the CEFR women had experienced 2 or more births, while this was
true of 74 per cent of the Shipibo
women. Also, 54.7 per cent of the
CEFR women had experienced one or
more induced abortions, whereas only
one of the Shipibo women gave a history
of induced abortion. The rate of spontaneous abortions was similar for both
groups at approximately 13 per cent.
Because of these extreme differences in
fertility experience, the original IFR
formula could only be applied to 31 per
cent of the CEFR population.

In order to devise a way of using the
concept for both populations, I defined
the reproductive span of the CEFR
women as being bounded by the first

and last “reproductive event’: term
birth, induced abortion, or miscarriage;
and I determined that the mean reproductive span of the CEFR women witha
span greater than zero was 61.9 months
or 5.13 years. I also determined that the
mean reproductive span of those with
one or more induced abortions (but no
term births) was 27.6 months (2.3
years). Al! CEFR women with 1 term
birth were the assigned reproductive
span values of 60 months, and those
with 1 or more induced abortions (but
no term births) were assigned reproductive spans of 28 months.

The result of this analysis showed the
CEFR women (valid N = 460) to have a
mean IFR of 33.9 and median IFR of
20.0, standard deviation of 38.9 and
standard error of 1.8 (Figure 4). The distribution of values was strongly influenced by the large number cases of
substituted mean values.

ues in the same fashion with the Shipibo
population did not seriously distort the
results since so few of the Shipibo
women (8 per cent) had experienced
only one term birth.

DISCUSSION

There are several advantages to the
Individual Fertility Rate as calculated
here. It is independent of age and can be
used when the age of the respondent is
uncertain. It is independent of age at
marriage, which has its own set of uncertainties. It is an incidence-density-type
variable since it is a function of time
(Miettinen, 1976; Morgenstern et al.,
1980). It reflects intensity of fertility experience since it is current and can be
used meaningfully for young women
who have not completed their reproductive careers. By contrast, Age-Specific
and Mean Completed Fertility are most
useful for a large population containing
a significant proportion of menopausal
women with certain age data.

Without exception, measures of fertility used by demographers are aggregates. Debates concerning the use of
Crude Birth Rate versus Total Fertility
Rate, for example, are valid and interesting, but they do not help in resolving
some of the issues faced in research

Social Biology

with small populations (Entwisle, 1981).
Aggregate measures may conceal important intragroup differences that are
sources of confounding or of primary interest. In the study of rapidly changing
and modernizing peasant societies, new
demographic tools may be necessary to
capture the details of change (Caldwell,
1982).

The IFR has similar advantages over
another aggregate measure of fertility in
populations with limited information,
the Fertility Pattern Method (Wishik
and Helbig, 1972).

In this study, IFR proved to be an extremely useful device for studying the
effect of various independent variables
on individual fertility.
