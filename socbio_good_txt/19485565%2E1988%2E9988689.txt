ABSTRACT: From 1976 to 1984 important demographic changes occurred in Panama. The total
fertility rate declined from 4.5 to 3.7, and contraceptive use among married women 20—44 years
of age increased from 55 per cent to 63 per cent. However, using data from three national level
reproductive health surveys which were conducted in Panama in 1976, 1979, and 1984, we
found that most of the changes took place between 1976 and 1979. Since 1979, overall
contraceptive use and fertility have remained virtually unchanged, although there has been an
important method-mix shift toward an increase in the use of contraceptive sterilization and
IUD’s, with an accompanying decline in the use of oral contraceptives. Although the singulate
mean age at marriage remained relatively constant, the average duration of breastfeeding rose
23 per cent during the period. Further gains in contraceptive prevalence and reduction in
unplanned fertility in Panama will largely depend on enhanced program efforts first begun in
the early 1970’s by the Panama Ministry of Health. Future program efforts especially should be
directed toward encouraging young couples to space their children more effectively by using
temporary methods of contraception.

the 1976 enumeration districts were updated in 1979. There were two strata in
both surveys: urban and rural. Two
health regions—Darien and San Blas—
were excluded from the two early surveys; both regions are primarily rural
with difficult access and have mostly Indian populations. The major difference
between these surveys was that the 1976

PROXIMATE DETERMINANTS MODEL

Bongaarts’ model of the four primary
fertility-inhibiting variables (nuptiality,
contraceptive use, abortion, and lactation) that directly affects fertility consists of four indices (Bongaarts, 1978,
1982; Bongaarts and Potter, 1983).

Contraception and Fertility in Panama 75

Abortion is not included in this analysis
because reliable estimates of Panama’s
abortion rate are not available. The indices range in value from 0 to 1 and are
computed as follows:

(1) Index of proportion married
(Cm).—Cm equals 1 if all women of reproductive age are married, and 0 in the
absence of marriage. Cm = f(a)/(f(a)/
m(a)), where m(a) equals the proportion currently married among females,
by age, and f(a) is a schedule of agespecific fertility rates.

(2) Index of contraception (Cc).—Cc
equals 1 in the absence of contraception,
and 0 if all fecund women use 100 per
cent effective contraception. Cc = 1 —1.08 * e * u, where e is the average useeffectiveness of contraception and u is
the prevalence of current contraceptive
use among married women.

(3) Index of postpartum infecundability (Ci). —Ci equals 1 in the absence
of lactation and postpartum abstinence
and Oif the duration of infecundability is
infinite. Ci = 20/(18.5 + i) where i is
the mean duration of postpartum infecundability in months.

RESULTS
FERTILITY TRENDS

Period fertility estimates indicate
that the total fertility rate (TFR) in Panama declined on the average by 0.8 child
per woman from 1976 (TFR = 4.5) to
1984 (TFR = 3.7) (Table 1). Comparing the TFR’s across time, we found that
most of the decline occurred between
1976 and 1979. Fertility declined by 18
per cent between 1976 and 1979; the decline was only 5 per cent between 1979
and 1984.

A comparison of the age-specific fertility rates between 1976 and 1984 suggests that the fertility of younger women

(less than age 25) has followed a Ushaped trend, with a decline between
1976 and 1979, followed by an increase
between 1979 and 1984. The rate for
older women has declined substantially.
For each age group above age 25, the
fertility rate declined from 15 per cent
(age groups 25-29 and 30-34) to over 45
per cent (age groups 35-39 and 40-44).

LACTATION

Breastfeeding is an important determinant of fertility because its duration
directly affects the length of the postpartum anovulatory period. The prevalence of breastfeeding increased in Panama between 1976 and 1984, with most
of the increase occurring since 1979. In
1976 and 1979, 80 per cent of the women
who reported a live birth within 24
months of the date of interview said they
breastfed that child compared with 93
per cent in 1984 (Table 2). The average
duration of breastfeeding increased by
23 per cent between 1976 and 1984 (Table 2). The duration rose from 8.4
months in 1976, to 9.5 months in 1979,
and to 10.3 months in 1984. The period
of postpartum amenorrhea had a corresponding slight increase from 5.0 months

months in 1984.

NUuPTIALITY

The singulate mean age at marriage
(the average age at first marriage among
all women who ever marry, including
consensual unions) remained fairly constant between 1976 and 1984 (approximately 21 years), although there are indications that a slight decline may be
occurring (Table 3). Examination of the
proportion of women who ever marry
by age shows: (1) For each age group
less than age 35, the proportion ever
married increased between 1976 and
1984; and (3) by age 30, for each survey,
marriage is nearly universal in Panama.
If these trends continue, the mean age at
marriage will decline.

CONTRACEPTIVE USE

Contraceptive use among married
women 20 to 44 years of age increased
from 1976 to 1984 (55 per cent to 63 per
cent), an increase of 15 per cent (Table
4). Since the increase occurred between
1976 and 1979, the overall level of contraceptive use did not change from 1979
to 1984 (Table 4). From 1976 to 1979,

same level. Although overall use was

IUD use, while the use of oral contra

ceptives declined. Similar trends toward
increased use of sterilization and decreased use of oral contraceptives have
been found in other populations which
have been studied since 1976: Puerto
Rico (1976 to 1982); United States (1976
to 1982); and Costa Rica (1976 to 1986)
(see Ross et al., 1985).

Table 5 examined changes in the
prevalence of various methods of contraception over time by age group. The
use of female sterilization increased dramatically in Panama between 1976 and
1984, both within each age group and
for each age cohort over time. The use
of the pill increased between 1976 and
1979 for women age 20 to 29, then declined between 1979 and 1984. All other
age groups and age cohorts showed a decline in the use of the pill between 1976
and 1984. The IUD showed little change
in use by age group between 1976 and
1979; but a substantial increase for ages
20 to 29 between 1979 and 1984. Use of
withdrawal and rhythm declined, generally, for all age groups between 1976 and
1984.

PROXIMATE DETERMINANTS OF FERTILITY

The relative influence of nuptiality,
contraceptive use, and lactation were
measured using Bongaarts proximate
determinates model. In this model, the
importance of each factor is calculated
as an index value ranging from 0.0 to
1.0. The further the index value is from
1.0 the greater is that factor’s effect on
reducing fertility.

Each year, contraceptive use (Cc)
had the strongest effect on inhibiting
fertility (Table 6). The influence of contraception on reducing fertility increased between 1976 and 1979, but was
virtually unchanged between 1979 and
1984. This finding is consistent with the

fect on reducing fertility, but the effect
did increase between 1976 and 1984.

Figure 1 shows the relative importance of each proximate determinant
compared across the years. As previously noted, contraception is the most
important factor followed by marriage
and then lactation. The most striking aspect is the lack of change in the effect of
contraception and marriage between
1979 and 1984.

DISCUSSION

During the past ten years, fertility declined in Panama, but most of the
change occurred in the first half of the
decade. Our analysis of the trends in
three primary proximate determinants
of fertility (contraceptive use, nuptial-.

ity, and lactation) suggest a rationale
which accounts for the fertility trend.
Our results, also, indicate possible programmatic changes that are needed if
Panama is to return to a downward
trend in fertility. The following discussion focuses on these issues as they relate to the proximate determinants.
Contraceptive use has been the most
important factor inhibiting fertility in
Panama during the past decade. In
1969, the Ministry of Health in Panama
became actively involved in providing
family planning services in its maternalchild health facilities. Between 1976 and
1979 the Ministry of Health’s family
planning program made important
strides as evidenced by an 8 percentage
point increase in contraceptive use.
However, since 1979 the program’s im

pact has reached a plateau, as contraceptive use did not change between 1979
and 1984. Along with the plateau effect
in overall use, our results suggest that
two practices related to method-mix and
age are adversely affecting the fertilityinhibiting effect of contraception.

First, female sterilization has been
the method of choice in Panama during
the past decade, and its prevalence has
increased dramatically during this time.
In 1984, over one-third of currently married women age 20 to 44 were sterilized.
However, we found that in 1984 more
than 40 per cent of the women who were
sterilized had never used any other
method of contraception. An average
age at sterilization in Panama of 30 years
and an average age of first marriage of
20 years represents 10 years with no use
of child-spacing services for a sizeable
proportion of the population. Women
who were sterilized have 4.2 children,
on the average, compared to 2.8 children ever born for women notsterilized.

Second, for all young women (less
than age 30) there has been a decline in
contraceptive use during the past decade. This decline was largely due to a decreased use of the pill which was not offset by an increase in the use of female
sterilization or the IUD.

These two trends suggest programs
are needed to encourage greater use of
temporary methods of contraception,
especially among young women. An education program directed toward young
women focusing on the benefits of fertility regulation and birth spacing would
be useful.

Overall, age at first marriage has not
changed significantly in the past decade.
However, a slight decline did occur between 1979 and 1984. A decrease in age
at marriage conversely increases a woman’s time at risk of pregnancy. In addition, in 1984, nearly 30 per cent of cur
Social Biology

rently married women less than age 30
had premaritally conceived first births.
Thus, for young women (less than age
30) in Panama, the risk of having an unplanned pregnancy appears to be increasing. Our analysis of the trend in age
at first marriage, as with contraception,
suggests the need for programs directed
toward educating young women in Panama about the need for birth spacing
and use of contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancies.

During the past decade, both the
prevalence and the average duration of
breastfeeding increased in Panama.
This trend is similar to that observed in
other Latin American countries in recent surveys, namely, Guatemala
(Monteith et al., 1985) and Costa Rica.
Thus, lactation is the only proximate determinant having a trend toward decreasing fertility in Panama. However,
the duration of breastfeeding in Panama
is short, so the overall fertility inhibiting
effect of this factor is minimal.

CONCLUSION

Our study of changes in fertility and
contraceptive use in Panama has shown
that initial program success has not been
sustained. There has been a leveling-off
in the past five years. Contraceptive use
is the most important factor affecting
fertility in Panama. However, between
1979 and 1984 there was no change in
overall prevalence. Further gains in contraceptive prevalence and reduction in
unplanned fertility in Panama will
largely depend on enhanced program
efforts first begun in the early 1970’s by
the Panama Ministry of Health. Future
program efforts should be especially directed toward encouraging young couples to space their children more effectively by using temporary methods of
contraception.
