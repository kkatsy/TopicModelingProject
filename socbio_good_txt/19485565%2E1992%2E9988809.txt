ABSTRACT: The achievement or reproductive intentions of Sri Lankan women was examined by
ysing longitudinal data for the period 1982-85. Aggregate consistency between reproductive
Gntentions and behavior was almost perfect, but at the individual level there were inconsistencies.
SAmong those who wanted to have no more children, 23 per cent reported a birth in the
<intersurvey period of 3 years and 2 months, while failures to have a wanted birth stood at 36
cher cent. There was a clear declining trend in the former type of inconsistencies in Sri Lanka,
“but the latter type has increased, possibly due to a continuing decline in family size ideals or due

.whether to include sterilized women when fertility intentions and behavior are examined lon“Qitudinally, but no specific problems were found with their inclusion. Results indicate that, apart

iversity

Evidence about the relationship beeen fertility intentions and behavior
more scarce than that about the retionship of attitudinal and normative
ctors to intentions, mainly because
the former requires a longitudinal reSearch design, which is more costly in
oth time and resources. However, the
predictive validity of reproductive intentions has been the subject of an increasing number of studies throughout
the world in the recent past, since rationalization in reproductive reports is
a major problem when this area is approached with cross-sectional data.
The importance of longitudinal studies
is that they shed light on the degree to
which people plan their reproduction
and successfully implement those plans

which is of considerable policy relevance.

Even though in most studies in the
developed countries women’s reproductive intentions tended to exceed the
number of children actually born
(Westoff and Ryder, 1977), many of
the longitudinal studies which link reproductive intentions to subsequent
fertility have shown that individual intentions are often sufficiently stable to
have a large effect on subsequent fertility (Freedman et al., 1965; Hermalin
et al., 1979; Foreit and Suh, 1980; Nair
and Chow, 1980; Stycos, 1984; Van de
Giessen, 1988; Vlassoff, 1990; Thomson et al., 1990). Such consistency has
mostly been observed in societies
where contraception is widely prac

ticed. However, due to the way intentions were measured and the fact that
intentions can be continuously reassessed, some disagreement should be
expected (Morgan, 1985).

In Sri Lanka, as in much of the developing world, fertility has been falling rapidly with rapid adoption of contraception. The total fertility rate
dropped from 5.0 in 1963 to 3.5 in
1981, and the estimate of 2.8 for the
period 1982-87 found by the Sri Lanka
Demographic and Health Survey
(SLDHS) witness its continuing decline (Department of Census and Statistics, 1988). But evidence is rather
limited in Sri Lanka concerning the relationship between reproductive intentions and behavior. Therefore, the
main purpose of this paper is to take
advantage of a longitudinal data set
from Sri Lanka to examine statements
about fertility intentions at oné point
of time and assess subsequent fertility
against them, and also to provide a
comparison of level of inconsistencies
with a few other selected countries
where the same type of information exists.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The sample for the present study
was drawn from the records of the 1982
Sri Lanka Contraceptive Prevalence
Survey (SLCPS) and its follow-up
study, the 1985 Sn Lanka Contraceptive Survey (SLCS). The 1982 survey
enumerated 4,500 ever-married women 15-49 years old, and covered the
whole of Sri Lanka. Because of civil
disorder, seven districts in the northern
and eastern parts of the country (which
constituted only 14 per cent of the total
population) were excluded from the

Social Biology

1985 follow-up survey. As defined by
the Department of Census and Statistics (1987), the sample for the 1985
follow-up consisted of all 1982 SLCPS
respondents who lived in the sample
districts, were married at the time of
the 1982 SLCPS and also at the time of
the 1985 SLCS, and were younger than
50 at the time of the 1985 SLCS. The
1985 follow-up study therefore necessarily covers only women who had
been married for at least three years
and were 18 or more years of age. The
1985 follow-up study covered 2,310 respondents or 76 per cent of those who
were eligible. Computer and manual
matching of these women with women
interviewed in the 1982 survey yielded
2,219 matched respondents, and their
response consistency on demographic
variables was found to be high (De
Silva, 1991). They had an average time
lag of 3 years and 2 months between
interviews. There was not much variation in the time difference between the
surveys: the longest was 3 years and 4
months while the shortest was 3 years
(De Silva, 1990).

Many studies have found that the
desire for additional children predicts
subsequent behavior relatively better
than comparing desired and actual
number of children. In the present
analysis, whether respondents wanted
more children at Time 1 is compared
with behavior between Time 1 and
Time 2. Over the intersurvey period,
2,047 eligible respondents, for whom
there were longitudinal observations
available, reported slightly fewer than
1,000 births, but fewer (881) were used
in the analyses reported here. Since the
reproductive preferences of pregnant
women were determined by asking
‘(Do you want to have children in the

Vol. 39, No. 1-2

future (in addition to the one you are
expecting)?’’, births which took place
as a result of pregnancies current at the
time of the 1982 SLCPS were excluded. On the other hand, women
who reported being pregnant at the
time of the 1985 SLCS were treated as
having given birth between the surveys.

RESULTS

EXTENT OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN
INTENTIONS AND BEHAVIOR

Of the 2,047 women for whom there
were longitudinal observations on original intentions and reproduction, 64
per cent said at Time 1 that they did not
want any more children, while the rest
wanted at least one more child (Table
1). Over the intersurvey period, 62 per
cent had no additional children while
38 per cent had one or more live births.
Among the women who did not want
any more children, about 77 per cent
had no live birth in the interim, but the

125

others failed to achieve their wish, having one or more live births between
surveys. Of the 735 women who expressed a desire for more children at
Time 1, 64 per cent had one or more
before Time 2 or were pregnant at that
date. Results indicate a clear association between intentions and behavior
among Sri Lankan women at the aggregate level, but at the individual levels some inconsistencies were evident.
These figures are, of course, in part
functions of the length of the follow-up
period. If it had been longer, there
would have been more opportunity for
inconsistency to rise and for consistency to fall among those who wanted
no more children.

The definition of inconsistency
among those who wanted no more children is straightforward; they had one
or more live births or were pregnant at
Time 2. Those who wanted more children but did not have them by 1985
may still have had additional children
thereafter. However, given the three
years and two months period, those

who wanted more but had no birth and
were not pregnant by Time 2 are defined as “inconsistent.” Since the pregnancy status of women at Time 2 1s also
incorporated in the study, for all practical purposes the longitudinal observations should extend almost up to 4
years. Even though the definition is
somewhat loose, a similar definition
has been adopted by most other studies
with longitudinal observational periods
of three to four years (Freedman et al.,
1975; Hermalin et al., 1979; Monnier,
1987; Van de Giessen, 1988).

CORRELATES OF INCONSISTENCY

Demographic variables.—As_ expected, the percentage of women who
had another child during 1982-85 decreases significantly with increasing
age, marriage duration, and number of
living children (Table 2). These estimates follow closely trends in the percentages of women intending more
children shown in the first column of
Table 2. However, decreases in percentages of women wanting more are
generally somewhat larger than those
in percentages having a child between
surveys. Proportions wanting more are
higher at earlier stages in the life-cycle
(age <25, duration of marriage <5,
and <2 living children) than are proportions who actually had children between the surveys. However, later in
the life-cycle, interim fertility often
stands higher than expectations. Although it is not shown in Table 2, aggregate inconsistency, which refers to
the difference between the percentages
having more and wanting more children expressed as a percentage of
those wanting more (Hermalin et al.,
1979), increases rapidly from negative
values to positive values with increas
Social Biology

ing age, marital duration, and number
of living children.

At the individual level, two types of
inconsistency are possible. A woman
may want to have another child and fail
to do so, or she may not want to have
another child and have one anyway.
The percentage inconsistent among
women who wanted more children increases rapidly with age and marital
duration, but the number of living children does not show much difference
(Column 3 of Table 2). It is evident
that considerable proportions of the
younger, recently married women had
unintended births between the surveys, while the greater failure to have
desired additional children among
older women and women at higher
marriage durations probably is partly a
result of subfecundity and the intervention of family planning. These expressions of the intention to have more may
be an attempt to communicate their
love for children, even though they
are, in fact, unable or unwilling to have
any more (Westoff and Ryder, 1977).
The same pattern of inconsistency has
been reported in most longitudinal
studies where reproductive preferences (desire for more children) have
been compared with subsequent behavior (Bumpass and Westoff, 1969;
Coombs, 1979; Hermalin et al., 1979;
Nair and Chow, 1980).

Overall inconsistency at the individual level (Column 5 of Table 2) is moderately large at early and intermediate
stages of the life-cycle, since the percentage wanting more children, the
percentage inconsistent among those
who wanted more, and the percentage
inconsistent among those who wanted
no more, are all moderately large. In
general, overall inconsistency at the inDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

dividual level remains the same in the
early and middle stages of the lifecycle, and then decreases considerably
at later life-cycle stages. It should be
noted that the large percentages of
women at early life-cycle stages who
wanted no more children, but had
more, refer to small subgroups. Similarly, the large percentage of older
women who did not have a child between surveys, although wanting to
also, refers to very few individuals.

Socioeconomic — variables. —When
fertility between the surveys and intended fertility in 1982 are compared
for women at different socioeconomic
levels, the importance of modernization is clearly apparent. At the aggregate level there was a deficit of fertility
among better-educated couples,! while
among the rest the combination of an
educated wife and a less-educated husband showed the largest discrepancy
(Table 2). At the individual level, educated wives with less-educated husbands also showed the highest level of
inconsistency, principally because they
were the most likely to have had a child
after stating that they wanted no more.
But, among women who wanted more
children, the combination of an educated husband and wife was the most
likely to have failed to have a child.
The time constraint factor may be relevant here. The better-educated may
simply have been deferring childbearing longer.

1Since the levels of education of husband and
wife are interrelated, a composite education variable (couple's education) was created. Less than or
equal to six years of education was categorized as
“less educated”’; the rest, as ‘‘educated.’’ Categorization was made for four classes: both less educated;
husband educated, wife less educated; wife educated, husband less educated; both educated.

 

Social Biology

Educated women with educated
husbands may have been disproportionately of zero parity, in which case
the timing of the next birth represents
the onset of the family formation period, which is a different situation from
that of women with at least one child.
Comparison of proportions of women
at zero parity in the four educational
categories shows little difference: 17
per cent of the educated couples were
at zero parity compared to 14 per cent
of the less-educated couples, and the
lowest figure was recorded for educated husbands married to lesseducated wives (Table 3). Although
some effect of the type described could
be present, these differences could not
be strongly related to failure to have a
child among the better-educated who
wanted one. On the other hand, for
most Sri Lankan couples, contraception appears to be used for spacing or
stopping rather than to delay the first
pregnancy (Kane and Sivasubramaniam, 1989). Perhaps economic reasons, such as deteriorating employment opportunities and the increased
cost of living after 1983, were more influential than any other factors in causing better-educated couples not to realize their reproductive goals. Mainly
owing to increased defense expenditure (Wilson, 1989), economic growth
slowed during 1982-85 compared to
earlier periods. GNP increased at an
average annual rate of 3.6 per cent
compared to 5.9 per cent during 197781.

Among the ethno-religious categories, about 49 per cent of Moor/Muslim
women intended to have more children
in 1982, and by 1985 about 54 per cent
had done so (Table 2). At the aggregate level, Sinhalese/Buddhist and

Vol. 39, No. 1-2

Tamil/Hindu women were fairly consistent, while Christians as a whole underestimated their fertility. At the individual level, however, over 40 per
cent of Christian women who wanted
more children failed to have more between the surveys. In other words, unwanted childbearing both compensated for this and produced the
aggregate excess of childbearing. Unintended childbearing among those
who wanted no more children was proportionately highest for Moor/Muslim
women.

Among the residence categories,
only urban women showed an aggregate intersurvey deficit of fertility compared to expectations. At the individual level, 40 per cent of urban women
as well as of women with husbands employed in the modern sector who intended to have more children in 1982
had not done so by 1985 (Column 3 of
Table 2), but urban women were also
conspicuously more successful than rural and estate women in avoiding unwanted pregnancies (Column 4 of Table 2). Even though the workparticipation status of women made no
ageregate difference between intentions and behavior, at the individual
level, women working away from their

Reproductive Intentions in Sri Lanka

129

homes were found to be the most inconsistent, while those women working at home were the opposite.
Failure to have wanted births and
the experience of having an unwanted
birth do not occur evenly among different demographic and _ socioeconomic groups of women. Failure to
have wanted births may be partly a result of the changes in their intentions
from wanting more children to wanting
to cease childbearing. As pointed out
earlier, the time constraint factor may
also be important here. Some women
who wanted more children at Time 1
may have wanted to have their next
child after a period longer than the
follow-up period. Even though about
half (58 per cent) of the women who
wanted another child favored birth intervals of two years or more, it is unlikely that many favored long birth intervals (say five years or more).
Because of late marriage in Sri Lanka,
it is reasonable to think that few would
want such long birth intervals; and it
has been found that once women have
reached age 35, the overwhelming majority want to have no more children
(Pullum, 1980; De Silva, 1990). Therefore, a large proportion of these apparent spacers in Sri Lanka could be de

facto terminators (Rindfuss et al.,
1988).
Whatever the explanation for these

discrepancies, if failures to have
wanted births and to avoid unwanted
births are minimal, then respondents’
preferences for additional children
combined with a variable giving additional numbers of children wanted
could be used to predict future fertility
and be incorporated into population
projections (Van de Giessen, 1988).
This is not attempted in this study. Instead, the extent to which reproductive
intentions and other variables predict
the occurrence of a live birth during
1982~85 is examined by using multivariate logistic regression.

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS

Even though the influence of reproductive intentions on subsequent fertility in the context of different life-cycle
stages and socioeconomic conditions
could be treated in tabular form, logistic regressions which use the dichotomous dependent variable (whether or
not had a birth between 1982 and 1985)
assess the independent effects of one
or another variable after controlling
for others. Initially, therefore, all the
variables and their first order interactions were included in the “‘saturated”’
model and the net effects of the variables were estimated by using GLIM
(Baker and Nelder, 1978) software. Selection of the final model involved the
elimination of the interaction term
with the lowest statistical significance
and re-estimation of the model; backward elimination procedure was used.
No interaction term was found to be
statistically significant, and among the
socioeconomic variables, all except
husband’s and wife’s education were

 

Social Biology

also eliminated from the model because of their nonsignificance.

Since it is a controversial question
whether to include or to exclude sterilized cases from the analysis, the
present analysis is carried out in two
stages. The first model includes those
women sterilized, or women whose
husbands were Sterilized at Time 1,
while the second model excludes
them.? The procedure permits examination of the socioeconomic differentials in reproductive behavior between
the two models. The final results of the
multivariate analysis appear in Table 4,
which shows the logistic regression coefficients and odd ratios for the two
models. The effect of each independent variable on the response variable
is estimated by the odds ratios for each
variable category relative to the reference category which has the odds ratio
of one. The ratio of less than one indicates less likelihood of having a birth
than in the reference group while the
ratio of more than one indicates the opposite.

Life-cycle variables such as age,
marital duration, and number of living
children all show substantial net effects
on fertility. The younger the women
were and the shorter the durations of
their marriages, the more likely they
were to report a live birth during 198285. The relationship was reversed
when 1982-85 fertility was compared
with number of living children at Time
1; women with larger families had had

*Reproductive intentions and behavior were examined in a Costa Rican (1976-78 World Fertility

data from the United States National Fertility Survey of 1970-75 included contraceptively sterilized
respondents.

more children over the period than
women with small family sizes.

After controlling reproductive intentions and demographic variables,
husband and wife education composition shows a significant impact on reproductive behavior in the follow-up
period. The likelihood of having a
birth in this period was lowest for the
couples comprising an educated husband and wife, while the opposite is
true for the less-educated couples.
However, the odds ratio for having a
birth in the intersurvey period for the
educated women with less-educated

husbands shows almost the same level
as with less-educated couples. Estimates of demographic and education
variables reported in both models show
a strong consistent pattern of reproductive behavior. Analysis of reproductive intentions and behavior (at
least in the Sri Lankan situation) has
made no significant distortion when
sterilized women were included, and
therefore such inclusion could not be
considered a serious limitation.

In both models, the logit coefficients
for reproductive intentions at Time 1

tility. Women who at Time | expressed
a desire to have more children, independent of the effects of other independent variables, did have more.
However, among the women categorized as ‘‘certainly no more’”’ (sterilized) in the first model, a small fraction
did report a birth in the follow-up period (Table 4). How did inconsistency
occur? As shown in the Table 5, 493
respondents (or their husbands) of the
present sample who wanted no more
children were reported to be sterilized
at Time 1, but 3 per cent of these
women had a birth during 1982-85.
These discrepancies may be related to
a number of factors, of which the first
is surgical failure, or the reversal of
male or female sterilization? (Weisberg
and Fraser, 1982; Thapa and Vaidya,
1990). A second possibility is that some
women were already pregnant at the
time of the sterilization (Brown and
Schanzer, 1980), and a third is possible
errors in matching. Finally, even
though this analysis refers to women
whose marriages were intact between
1982 and 1985, there may have been
some unreported marriage dissolutions, and in such cases where the original sterilization was a vasectomy, inconsistency in reporting sterilization or
subsequent fertility is not totally unexpected (Margaret Pyke Center, 1973).

3Even though no Sri Lankan data are available
so far, a small proportion of sterilization failures are
reported in many Clinical studies throughout the
world (Lee and Hagen, 1984; Trussell and Kost,
1987; Trussell et al., 1990). On the other hand, from
time to time the Family Planning Association of Sri
Lanka, which performs the majority of vasectomies,
receives requests for reversals from men who have
lost a child, remarried, or in later years had second
thoughts about sterilization (Basnayake, 1988). A
few Sri Lankans are believed to have undergone
sterilization reversal operations (often costly) in private hospitals and therefore may have been identified as inconsistent.

Social Biology

Moreover, here we are treating those
who were sterilized as certainly wanting no more, but there is no guarantee
that all sterilized women did not want
additional children at the survey date.
Recent survey findings from Sri Lanka
(1987 SLDHS) show that among sterlized women and women with sterilized husbands about 14 per cent expressed some regret about the
Sterilization and being unable to have
more children when asked: ‘““Do you
regret that you (your husband) had the
operation not to have any more children?” (Department of Census and
Statistics, 1988).

Findings so far indicate that reproductive intentions do predict subsequent behavior, not perfectly but to a
considerable extent. The question remains why some women failed to
achieve their stated reproductive
goals, specifically among those who
wanted to cease childbearing. We are
dealing with only women’s responses
on reproductive intentions at Time 1,
but their subsequent fertility may be
determined by their husbands or third
parties, such as women’s mothers or
mothers-in-law (Coombs and Chang,
1981; Hull, 1983; Morgan, 1985; Clifford et al., 1987; Thomson et al.,
1990). Some wives in the 1982 SLCPS
reported a difference of opinion with
their husbands on desire for additional
children, in answer to the question
“Do you think he (husband) wants to
have more children in the future?” In
these cases it was more often the husband who wanted, or was believed to
want, another child and the wife who
did not want one than vice versa. Fully
79 per cent of disagreements were of
the former type. Compared with the
woman’s reproductive intentions, the

‘S The reporting of births in the inter‘Ssurvey period by women who in Time

Glesires of some wives to cease child‘bearing may have been overridden by

roportion of genuine changes of attistude; fertility intentions could be
‘eviewed as more sequential, allowing
Afor reassessment at any time (Namboodiri, 1972; Rindfuss et al., 1988).
Thirdly, changes in intentions might
have occurred in response to a child’s
dying or developing a physical infirmity.4 It is also possible that some of

4Al]though data on physical infirmity are unavailable, limited information on the mortality experience of children born between January 1, 1980 and
the 1985 survey date was collected. The only deaths
that are relevant are those of children born before
Time 1 which occurred after the 1982 survey. They
are the only deaths which might have caused a revision of reproductive preferences. For the intersur

these women at Time 1 were indicating
that they did not want children in the
immediate future rather than that they
never wanted them. Whatever produced behavior inconsistent with original desires, the majority of inconsistent women probably experienced
unwanted births. Therefore, in future
research it may be useful to investigate
explanations for such inconsistencies in
detail. This investigation would enhance our knowledge on how people
plan their reproduction and how they
modify and achieve their expectations.

Since there was another longitudinal study, in Sri Lanka (1975-79)
which provided information on reliability of respondents’ intentions to

were found because of the persistence of low infant
and child mortality throughout the 1980’s in Sri
Lanka. Therefore, the variable was not incorporated in the following analysis.

1983), comparison of results is worthwhile. As shown earlier at the aggregate level, consistency during 1982-85
was remarkable: 36 per cent of women
wanted more children and 38 per cent
had more, giving a slight excess of actual over wanted fertility. By contrast,
during 1975-79, there was a large excess of actual fertility, implying that
women more frequently failed to behave according to their reproductive
intentions (Table 6). However, the
close correspondence of aggregate
level preferences and behavior during
1982-85 was partly the result of many
counterbalancing inconsistencies on
the part of individuals.

wanted no more children declined considerably from 38 per cent to 23 per
cent between 1975-79 and 1982-85
(Table 6). This decline could be largely
related to a rapid increase in acceptance of sterilization and a suspected
increase in induced abortions (De
Silva, 1990). While the percentage inconsistent among those who wanted no
more children has declined, the inconsistency level among those who wanted
more children has increased over time;

is a linear function of time) may not necessarily hold
in each longitudinal period. However, since per

of the explanation may be a downturn
in family-size ideas or a trend toward
birth intervals. An increasing proportion of contraceptors in the recent past
have used contraception not only to
terminate childbearing, but also to
postpone intended future births, and
this process could be related to the observed increase in inconsistency among
women who expressed a desire for
more children.

International comparison of aggregate inconsistency on a per-annum basis Clearly indicates that recent (198285) Sri Lankan levels are not far from
the levels of Taiwan (Table 6), although individual levels of inconsistency are much higher in Sri Lanka
than in Taiwan. Sri Lankan aggregate
inconsistency levels differ from those
in the United States. Over 40 per cent
of white females wanted more children
in 1970 in the United States, but only
one-third had actually had more by
1975, possibly because of significant reductions in desired family size or
strong intervention of family planning
to postpone births (Lee, 1980). Not
only in 1975-79 but also in 1982-85,
proportionately fewer Sri Lankan
women than Taiwanese (1970~74) and
United States women (1970-75) were
able to avoid undesired births. The
higher occurrence of undesired births
in Sri Lanka than in the United States
and Taiwan may be related to less frequent and less effective use of contraception. Moreover, the practice of inducing abortions to _ terminate
unwanted births in those two countries

annum estimates in Table 6 are based on fairly close
durations of longitudinal studies of three to five
years (except the 1973-82 United States study),
construction of such estimates may not seriously violate the linearity assumption.

was probably more frequent than in Sri
Lanka.

When the percentage inconsistent
among those who wanted more children is considered on a per-annum basis, the procreation goals set by Sri
Lankan women are never totally realized. Proportionately more Sri Lankan
women failed to achieve their targets
than women in either the United States
or Taiwan. Deferring childbearing
while seeking better economic opportunities could be the main reason that
the Mexicans in the United States have
shown the highest inconsistency (Table
6). Even after nine years, 47 per cent of
those who wanted another child were
inconsistent, while the corresponding
Sri Lankan figure was lower (36 per
cent) than that with only a three-year
longitudinal period. Policy planners in
Sri Lanka may be happy to see the decline of the inconsistency among those
who wanted to cease childbearing and
increase in the latter type, because
such a combination undoubtedly produces lower fertility. In fact, rapid decline in fertility is underway in Sri
Lanka. As reported in the 1987
SLDHS, the average total fertility rate
for the last 5 years was only 2.8, one of
the lowest fertility levels in the developing world.

CONCLUSION

This paper has described the reproductive intentions of and their achievement by Sri Lankan women, using a
longitudinal data base for the period
1982-85. Findings support the usefulness of reproductive intentions to examine actual behavior. Almost perfect
aggregate agreement was observed between 1982 intentions and 1982-85 beDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:44 08 December 2015

havior, although this close correspondence was partly the result of the
counterbalancing effect of individual
level inconsistency. Comparison of
earlier with later survey data showed
Sri Lankan women’s increasing ability
to avoid undesired fertility over time.
However, undesired fertility is still
considerably higher than that observed
in either the United States (whites) or
Taiwan. Meanwhile, recent civil unrest
and deterioration in economic conditions in Sri Lanka possibly motivated
many women to revise their family-size
ideals downward, and consequently
there was a higher failure rate in most
recent times among those intending to
have another child.

At the multivariate level when the
reproductive intention variable is included along with demographic and
socioeconomic variables to examine
subsequent fertility, it clearly demonstrates its influence. Those who intended to have another child did have
more in the intersurvey period. Inclusion or exclusion of the sterilized cases
made no obvious difference to the observed pattern. In both models examined, the intention variable retained
high significance. After controlling the
intention variable, the likelihood of a
birth during 1982-85 to younger and
recently married women was found to
be considerably higher than to the
older and longer married women. The
likelihood was also higher for less
Social Biology

educated couples, while educated couples reported the fewest intersurvey
births.

Depending on wives’ own intentions
and their perception of husband’s
intentions, some couples show disagreement on their reproductive expectations. Therefore, prediction of
subsequent behavior would have been
further improved if husbands’ intentions at Time 1 had been directly available along with those of their wives.
Alternatively, improvement in the predictive power of reproductive intentions could be ascertained by focusing
only on the women who believe that
their husbands also have the same fertility intentions.
