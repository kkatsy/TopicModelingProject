ABSTRACT: This paper compares the marriage frequencies of normal individuals with or without
mental retardates in their nuclear families for the different combinations of sex and parental and sib
phenotypes. Multivariate analysis indicates that there is a difference in the marriage frequencies of
norinal individuals with and without retarded family members caused by social response to the
trait. This response differs according to the sex of the normal individual, although the social factors

underlying this sex difference are not clear.

Two individuals with identical genotypes or phenotypes may have different
fitnesses because of abnormal sibs, parents,
or other relatives. This has been shown for
Huntington’s disease (Reed and Neel,
1959), where normal individuals with affected sibs have lower reproductive
fitness. Similar phenomena have been observed by some (Buck et al., 1975; Lindelius, 1970) for schizophrenia, although
others (Erlenmeyer-Kimling and Paradowski, 1966) have not found such a
trend. This kind of fitness interaction
among relatives has been called social selection (Yokoyama and Templeton, 1980;
Yokoyama, 1980a,b).

The evolutionary consequences of
fitness interaction among relatives have
also been considered in the study of altruism, where the concept of kin selection has
an important role (Hamilton, 1964;
Levitt, 1975; Matessi and Jayakar, 1976;
Charlesworth, 1978; Wade, 1978; Yokoyama and Felsenstein, 1978; CavalliSforza and Feldman, 1978). However, the
kin selection model requires at least two
individuals, t.e., altruist and recipient, to
specify a fitness interaction. This limits the

194

usefulness of this model when considering
the population dynamics of disease in
man. For example, the amount of fitness
loss of an altruistic parent cannot be determined until he/she has offspring, so that
viability selection in the usual sense cannot be considered. Similarly, an individual
without a sib must be selectively neutral
when considering sib-sib fitness interaction. The social selection model obviates
these difficulties and is useful for studying
the social impact of genetic or common
diseases, especially for investigating
mechanisms of disease maintenance in human populations. A detailed comparison
between social selection and kin selection
will be discussed elsewhere (Yokoyama,
1981). The concept of social selection
should clearly be distinguished from the
effect of socioeconomic status on the reproductive fitness of an individual (Bajema, 1966, 1968). Social selection may
operate within each social class and,
furthermore, an affected individual may
cause the downward mobility of the social
class of his/her family (Moran, 1965).
Social impact on the fitness of an individual due to a disease may be realized in

different life stages, e.g., viability, marriage, divorce, fertility, etc. Accordingly,
disease incidence depends on sociological
as well as genetic contributions to fitness,
and it is expected that the response to a
disease will depend both upon the characteristics of the disease and upon the ambient culture. Although there exists some
indication of such social reaction as already noted, no one has studied the mechanism or magnitude of social impact
caused by an affected individual.

To detect such social selection, we shall
compare the marriage frequencies of normal individuals with or without mental retardates in their nuclear families using the
data in Reed and Reed (1965). They have
compiled one of the most extensive data
bases and, most importantly, have reported pedigrees over several generations. The marriage frequency of normal
individuals was chosen because the
genetic contribution to the choice of a
mate is very small or almost nil and simply
reflects people’s reaction to mental retardation. To study people’s response to the
disease, further distinction among the retardates seems to be necessary since people may react differently to different levels
of severity.

We used only the data from the original
study, i.e., the data collected during the
years 1911 to 1918, since marriage status is
often unclear at the bottom of the pedigrees. Furthermore, by restricting our attention to the original data, trends due to
changing social factors will be minimized.
Mentally retarded individuals are classifed as L (Slight), M (Moderate), and S
(Severe), corresponding to IQ scores of
50-69, 20-49, and less than 20, respectively, and individuals with normal IQ are
classified as class N. Not all individuals are
given IQ scores in the pedigrees, and we
assume that the class ““unknown mental
ability” is normal (Reed and Reed consider this the most likely), and that ‘‘men
Familial Mental Retardation

 

195

tally deficient” individuals without IQ
scores are of class L. An individual who is
“unknown as to whether or not there are
children” is excluded from analysis, and
the resulting individuals are organized
into nuclear families. We distinguish normal individuals with no sibs or with normal sibs, with at least one L sib, with at
least one M sib, with at least one L sib and
one M sib, and with at least one S sib.
These classes are denoted by NN, LL,
MM, LM, and SS, respectively. Thus,
normal individuals are classified into different groups depending upon sex and
upon parental and sibs’ phenotypes.
Three nuclear families contained one
parent belonging to the class M. But these

_are a very small portion of data and are

therefore excluded from the analysis. The
number of nuclear families of the parental
typesN x N,N XL, andL X Lare 7,397,
758, and 132, respectively. The marriage
frequencies for the different combinations
of sex and parental and sib phenotypes are
shown in Table 1. The mating behavior of
the two sexes can be seen to differ. For females, the marriage frequency is weakly
affected by sib’s phenotype, but decreases
by about 10 per cent when both parents
are retarded, with the largest reductions
(33 out of 48) for parental type L x L with
at least one L sib. This reduction appears
to be due to parental phenotypes since
there is no significant reduction in the
marriages of normal females with more
severely retarded sibs. For males, the
magnitude of reduction in the marriage
frequency becomes larger as the severity
of retardation increases. For example, the
marriage frequency without any retarded
sib is about 80 per cent, as compared to 65
per cent when at least one S sib is present.
As in the case of females, there is a direct
effect due to parental phenotype. Normal
males with at least one L sib have a reduced marriage frequency when the
parents are of type N X LorL x L. Thisis

a partial explanation for the 10 per cent reduction in the marriage frequency when at
least one parent is retarded. Thus, in
males, the marriage frequency is affected
by both parents and sibs.

An ANOVA-like analysis for categortcal data was used to analyze the data in
Table 1. The multivariate analysis for the
categorical data was done using the procedure FUNCAT (SAS User’s Statistical
Analysis System Guide, 1979 Edition,
SAS Institute, Raleigh, North Carolina),
which implements the generalized least
squares method of Grizzle et al. (1969)
with a logistic response function. The response variable was the dichotomous marriage variable and the main effects were
sex, parental type, and sibling type coded
in Table 1. The best fitting model is displayed in Table 2. The chi-square values
given for each effect measure the effect of

tarded sib. They have compared the reproduction of 208 normal persons from
sibships with a retardate (IQ less than 70)
to that of 208 normal first cousins from a
sibship without a retardate. They have
shown that the reproductive fitness is the
same for the two groups (2.4 children per
person). Although the marriage frequency is only one component of the
fitness, there seems to exist a discrepancy
between the present results and those of
Reed and Reed. The difference may be
due to the definition of mental retardation. If mental retardation is defined as IQ
less than 70, then from Table 1 it can be
calculated that the marriage frequencies
of a normal person without any sibs or
with normal sibs and of a normal person
with at least one retarded sib are 4,931/
6,030 (81.8 per cent) and 1,765/2,257 (78.2
per cent) respectively. Although a homogeneity test 1s significant (x?,,, = 13.52,
p<0.001), the difference between these
marriage frequencies is small. People’s response to the disease depends upon its
severity and it is important to distinguish
the retardates according to their severity
in order to assess the social impact of mental retardation.

One may try to explain the decrease in
the marriage frequency of a normal male
with at least one S sib by considering that a
normal individual with severely retarded
sibs is more likely to have a lower IQ than
a normal individual with less severely retarded sibs. Because of this lower IQ
(even though higher than 70), the normal
individual with a severely retarded sib has
a lower marriage frequency than those
with less severely retarded sibs. However,
this explanation does not seem likely.
Severe mental retardation is more likely
to be caused by a chromosomal aberration
or by a single gene, whereas mild retardation seems to be caused by many loci
(Morton et al., 1977). Accordingly, the
correlation of IQ scores between normals

197

and their mildly retarded sibs would be expected to be higher than that between normals and severely retarded sibs.

Our analysis indicates that the difference in the marriage frequencies of
normal individuals with and without retarded family members is caused by social
response to the trait and that this response
depends on the sex of the normal individual. This suggests that different selective
forces for mental retardation are operating in the two sexes, although the social
factors underlying this sex difference are
not clear. In addition, this may explain the
difference in the mean number of surviving children of a proband’s normal sister
(2.44) and a proband’s brother (2.10)
which Reed et al. (1973) observed.

In the study of evolutionary aspects of
genetic or common diseases, the fitness of
an individual has traditionally been
quantified by using only his/her genotype
or phenotype. But the present data
analysis clearly shows that the social impact of diseases cannot be ignored and the
family structure has to be taken into consideration.

To estimate the fitness of a normal or
mentally retarded individual under social
selection, it is necessary to obtain information about the mental status of his own
as well as his spouse’s family members and
the number of offspring. Unfortunately,
the pedigree data in Reed and Reed does
not give such a complete picture. Therefore, new data sets which will overcome
these shortcomings are needed for fitness
estimation under social selection.
