Effects of Multi-Family Housing
on Marital Fertility in Iran:
Population Policy Implications

ABSTRACT: The hypothesis of the relationship between housing types and fertility, which was
originally developed and tested in Bogota, Colombia’s housing study, is reexamined using
Iranian data of urban married women of reproductive age. The findings of the study clearly and
consistently show that women living in single-family housing units have significantly higher
actual and desired fertility than women living in multi-family housing units, regardless of their
major social, economic and demographic differences. Furthermore, the analysis of the relative
effects of socioeconomic and demographic variables on fertility indicate that housing types have
greater effects on fertility than wife and husband’s level of education, when the effects of other
variables are controlled.

This study implies that crowding and density, which generally are the outcome of high
fertility, do have feedback effects causing fertility to decline. This provides some evidence for the
hypothesis of self-generating fluctuations in population growth which maintains that a large
population will face stiff economic competition, lower incomes, congestion and crowding if other
means of production as well as social infrastructure do not expand simultaneously.

Finally, this study suggests an optimistic sign of fertility reduction in the large urban
populations where the single-family housing units are being replaced by multi-family housing
units mainly because of high cost of land, material, and labor, and the shortage of housing units.

Most of the large cities in Iran today fit the above descriptions.

It is a well established fact that high
fertility leads to a high population density. But the effect of high density on
fertility behavior is not quite clear and
requires further theoretical reasoning
as well as empirical research. Some social scientists have advanced the optimistic thesis that “‘as population density increases, people will be motivated
to have smaller families on their own
initiative, before cataclysmic Malthusian suffering sets in” (Felson and Solaun, 1975). It is argued that people
living in crowded housing conditions
with little or no option of moving elsewhere will tend to reduce their fertility.
Thus, apartment living in a tight housing market would be likely to reduce
fertility.

The effect of high population density on fertility has been widely studied
in animal populations. For example,
Calhoun (1962) reported that high density inhibits the fertility of rats. Galle et
al. (1972) reviewed a number of studies
showing that the fertility of many animals is affected by high population
density (see Galle et al., 1972; Pervins,
1965; Christian and Davies, 1964; and
Laws and Parker, 1968).

The study of human population
density and its effect on fertility has
received some attention. Grauman
(1965) found inverse relationships between fertility and population density
for India in 1951, for the Soviet Union
in 1926, for parts of Brazil and Japan
in 1920-25, and for the United States

from 1800 to 1880 and from 1950 to
1960. A negative relationship between
population density and human fertility
was also reported in Heer’s (1966)
study of 41 nations and by Friedlander
and Silvers in similar studies. In contrast, Galle et al. (1972) reported a
positive relationship between high
population density and fertility in analyzing data from 75 communities in
Chicago.

On the micro level, the effect of
housing types on human behaviors and
attitudes has been widely studied. Wallace (1952) reported the shortcomings
of raising families in high-rise apartments. Mitchell (1971) observed that
high density housing in Hong Kong affected parental control over children.
Crowded apartments were more likely
to encourage children to spend their
leisure time away from home, usually
without parental supervision. Peled
(1969) reported that some parents living in small apartments were unhappy
that they did not have adequate space
to have more children. In a crowded
apartment, sexual activities, are often
inhibited by the presence of others.
Edwards and his associates (1992)
observed that Thai couples living in
crowded apartments in Bangkok were
reluctant to engage in sexual activities
with their spouses, because of the
proximity of other people.

The relationship between housing
configuration and marital fertility has
been investigated in a few studies. Fel
‘son and Solaun (1975), analyzing data

on public housing residents in Bogota,
Colombia found “that apartment living

‘significantly reduced fertility among

lower-middle and upper-working class
persons living in a tight housing market.” Felson and Solaun attributed the

Multi-family Housing

215

fertility reduction to psychosocial factors. They argued that population density itself was not responsible for the
fertility reduction, but rather a feeling
of crowding which they call ‘‘subjective
density” which created an incentive to
reduce fertility.

The Colombian study was replicated by Curry and Scriven (1978) in a
longitudinal study of blacks, MexicanAmericans, and other Americans living in a housing project in Racine,
Wisconsin. The Racine study found
that apartment living did not reduce
fertility when residential mobility was
possible. However, the study observed
that higher total fertility was found in
couples living in dwelling units with
more rooms.

Curry and Scriven (1978) integrated
the concept of subjective density, formulated in the Columbian study, with
the utility-cost theory to explain the
fertility reduction reported in both
studies. Their arguments briefly are (a)
that there is a rational element in fertility behavior, (b) that people balance
the satisfaction derived from having
children against their costs, and (c)
that a tight housing market may raise
the perceived “‘space costs” of additional children and thus result in fertility reduction.

The relationship between fertility
and housing may be evaluated in two
different scenarios. (1) When the housing market is very tight and expensive,
couples generally have limited choices.
The housing situation acts as a proxy,
limiting couples’ fertility planning. For
example, if a couple in a small apartment wishes to have a child but feels
they need more space, they may postpone or change their fertility planning
because there is little chance they can

find affordable housing. Thus, our thesis is that where couples do not have
the choice to move from a small dwelling unit to a larger unit, couples tend to
adjust their family size according to the
space available to them. (2) When the
housing market is not tight and affordable housing is available, couples can
choose housing according to their
needs. The household size acts as a dynamic force in the couples’ residential
mobility decision (see Michelson,
1977, p. 338).

This paper examines the relationship between types of housing and
marital fertility among the urban population of Iran. Housing in Iran in
the pre- and post-Islamic revolution
period, particularly in large cities, has
been both scarce and expensive.
Therefore, we expect that housing has
significantly affected the fertility pattern of Iranian couples. We hypothesize that Iranian married women living
in multi-family housing units, regardless of their sociodemographic status,
will have lower fertility than women
living in single-family housing units.
The crowded conditions of multifamily housing are likely to discourage
childbearing, childraising, and adding
another child to the family.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data used in this study is part
of a sociodemographic sample survey
of 2,126 households from three cities
in a southern province in Iran—Shiraz,
Jahrom, and Fasa.

Shiraz, capital of Fars province, is
the largest city in the south of Iran. In
1978, when this survey took place,
Shiraz had a population of 477,000,
making it the fifth largest city in Iran.

Social Biology

In common with medium-sized Western metropolitan cities, Shiraz is an educational, cultural, medical, and administrative center for the province
and a marketplace for nearby towns.
Shiraz has been characterized as Iran’s
most modern city without industrialization.

In contrast, Jahrom was one of the
most traditional cities of Fars province
with 52,000 residents at the time of the
survey. Fasa, in terms of modernization, fell between Shiraz and Jahrom
and had 49,800 residents. The households selected from Shiraz, Jahrom,
and Fasa numbered 1,286, 459, and
381, respectively.

A stratified multi-stage probability
sampling procedure was used to select
the households in each city. In addition
to general information, 1,715 currently
married women younger than age fifty
were interviewed to obtain fertility
data. The senior and graduate female
students in sociology at Shiraz University were the field workers and conducted the interviews using a questionnaire.

In the questionnaire, respondents
were asked the names and relationship
of other households who lived in the
same house (or apartment building).
From their responses, housing has
been classified in two types; (1) singlefamily housing and (2) multi-family
housing. Sixty-four per cent of the
households lived in single-family housing and 36 per cent lived in multifamily housing. Of the 609 households
living in multi-family housing, 37 per
cent were not related; 57 per cent were
related by blood or marriage; and 6 per
cent had a mixed relationship. |

The actual and desired fertility of
married women living in these two

housing types are compared while controlling for several sociodemographic
variables. Our hypothesis is that actual
and desired fertility of residents of
these two housing types will be different and that the fertility of women in
single-family housing will be higher
than that of women in multi-family
housing, regardless of sociodemographic attributes.

We reason that single-family housing generally has physical space for expansion to accommodate an additional
person. Residents generally have more
physical and social autonomy, more
privacy, more space and more facilities
than residents of multi-family housing.
These conditions are likely to motivate
single-family dwellers to have an additional child if they wish. On the contrary, the residents of multi-family
housing have limited capacity for expansion, generally lacking all of the
above conditions. In addition, tenants
are often discouraged by the property
owner from having another child. If
housing choices are scarce and expensive, couples are likely to postpone or
abandon plans for childbearing.

DEPENDENT VARIABLES

The actual and desired fertility of
Iranian married women are treated as
dependent variables. The three indicators used to measure fertility are: (1)
mean number of children ever born
(CEB); (2) mean number of living
children (LC); and (3) mean number of
desired fertility size (DFS).

INDEPENDENT VARIABLE

Type of housing is considered an
independent variable. A dichotomous
variable, consisting of two types of

Multi-family Housing

 

217

housing configurations, 1s constructed
to express the independent variable: ©

1. Single-family housing. This type of
dwelling unit has only one family
household whose members are socioeconomically integrated. The unit
may contain a nuclear family or an
extended family.

2. Multi-family housing. This type of
dwelling unit has more than one
family household. These households
are economically independent units.
They may be relatives, nonrelatives,
or mixed.

In Iran, multi-family housing exists
in different forms; two- or three-story
houses, duplexes, and apartment
buildings. Each apartment or floor typically is occupied by one household
who either owns the unit or rents it.
However, in relatively poor residential
areas, multi-family housing often consists of a relatively large house with
several tenant households. In this
housing type, a tenant occupies one or
two rooms and shares the house facilities (kitchen, toilet etc.) with other
tenants. Housing in Iran, single house
or apartment, is very expensive and
generally is not affordable for young
couples, particularly in large cities.

CONTROL VARIABLES

Several social, economic, and demographic variables are used as control variables:

A. Demographic Variables.

. Wife’s Current Age

. Duration of Marriage

. Wife’s Nativity Status

. Husband’s Nativity Status

. Breastfeeding (wife with two or
more children was asked if she
breastfed her child before the
last).

6. Child Mortality

RESULTS

Table 1 presents the per cent distribution of the major sociodemographic
attributes of Iranian married women
living in the two types of housing.
Sixty-four per cent of the total sample
lived in single family households, and
36 per cent in multi-family households.

As Table 1 suggests, the residents of :

the two types of housing are significantly different in regard to some attributes. Among them are home ownership, husband and wife’s education,
current age of wife, and her duration of
marriage. For example, a large proportion (39 per cent) of the residents in
multi-family housing owned their
units; 77 per cent of the single-family
dwellers were tenants. Over 62 per
cent of wives in multi-family housing
were married less than ten years versus
40 per cent of wives in single-family
housing. Wives in multi-family housing
were more educated and younger than
wives in single-family housing. For example, 21 per cent of wives in multifamily housing were less than twenty
years old versus only 6 per cent of
wives living in single-family housing.

Physical space limitation was another factor differentiating the residents of the two types of housing.
More than 72 per cent of the residents
in multi-family housing had only one or
two rooms for living versus 30 per cent
of residents in single-family housing.
Of the latter, 70 per cent had three or
more rooms in their housing units. Finally, as Table 1 shows, 80 per cent of
women living in multi-family housing
were residents of Shiraz; only 20 per
cent were from the sample of Jahrom
and Fasa. The respective figures for
single-family housing was 48 per cent
of the Shiraz sample and 52 per cent of
the Jahrom and Fasa sample.

Table 2 presents the distribution of
the measures of marital fertility for Iranian married women living in the two
types of housing by sociodemographic
variables. The three indicators used to
measure actual and desired fertility are
mean children ever born, mean living
children, and mean desired fertility
size. Table 2 shows the distribution of
these means for the two types of housing as well as the contexts of 18 control
variables.

The means for the total sample show
that women in single-family housing
had a mean of 4.6 children ever born,
a mean of 4.0 living children, and a
mean of 4.3 children as their desired
fertility. The corresponding figures for
women in multi-family housing were
remarkably smaller, 3.0, 2.7, and 3.5,
respectively. The same pattern, almost
without exception, exists among all 366
means.

In other words, Iranian women living in single-family housing consistently had higher fertility than women
living in multi-family housing, regardless of their sociodemographic differ

(1) There is clear and _ significant
differential fertility between residents
of two types of housing among the urban population of Iran. (2) The residents of Type I (single-family) housing
have significantly higher fertility than
the residents of Type II (multi-family)
housing, and this pattern persists when
eighteen key sociodemographic variables are controlled. (3) Type of housing, regardless of other variables, affects the decision to have another
child, or to postpone pregnancy, or to
control fertility. Of course, in relation
to housing and fertility decisionmaking, several issues must be taken
into consideration. Some of them are
the social, economic, and psychological cost of another child, space limitation, and housing market situations.

Our findings imply that the crowding and density, which generally are
the outcomes of high fertility, do have
feedback effects causing fertility to decline. Our data provide some evidence,
at the micro level, for the hypothesis of
self-generating fluctuations in population growth which has been introduced
by a number of population economists.
According to this hypothesis, a large
population will face stiff economic
competition, lower incomes, congestion, and crowding if other means
of production as well as the social
infrastructure do not expand along
with population (see Easterlin, 1973;
Becker, 1981; and also Barro and
Becker, 1984). It is predicted that under such circumstances, fertility will
decline because parents try to maintain
an adequate standard of living for
themselves.

Fertility studies have not paid as
much attention to the effects of housing types and configuration on differ

ential fertility as they have to other
variables such as education, occupation, income, etc. Our analysis of the
relative effects of sociodemographic
variables on fertility indicate that housing types, regardless of the effects of
other variables, have greater effects
on fertility change than the effect of
husband and wife’s education.

In sum, our findings from three Iranian cities show that type of housing
has a significant effect on the fertility
decision-making of couples regardless
of their socio-demographic differences. Couples residing in multi-family
housing, such as an apartment, a duplex, etc., have significantly lower fertility than couples living in singlefamily housing. We have argued that
scarce and expensive housing (rent
and buying) in Iran, particularly in
the large cities, has limited couples’
choices. Consequently, they have adjusted their fertility (actual and desired) to their dwelling environments.
If our findings from the Fars province
are generalizable to Iran today, we
anticipate further fertility reduction
among urban populations due to housing. Scarce and expensive housing is a
significant urban problem in Iran today. In response to the housing shortage, a large proportion of the singlefamily houses are being demolished
and replaced by expensive apartment
complexes. We anticipate that this development will cause further fertility
reduction in the urban population of
Iran. For a more conclusive explanation of the relationship between housing and fertility, more cross-sectional
as well as longitudinal data on the urban population in Iran today are
needed.
