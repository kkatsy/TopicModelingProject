Sociocultural Correlates of Fertility
Among Tribal, Rural, and Urban

Populations in Iran

Ali A. Paydarfar

Carolina Population Center
University of North Carolina
Chapel Hill, North Carolina

The fertility differences among women
are determined by a variety of reasons,
not all of which have been identified.
Despite extensive studies, differential fertility has yet to be fully. explained. It is
imperative that explanations be found if
fertility is to be controlled, and control
seems to be essential to improve socioeconomic conditions.

In a recent work, Karen O. Mason and
her associates (1971) reviewed and analyzed more than a hundred studies on differential fertility in the developed and
developing countries. In this work, the
authors present the major studies undertaken to measure the effect of socioeconomic variables on family fertility. The
major variables included in the studies
were: income, occupation, social and geographic mobility, education, family structure, female labor-force participation, egalitarian maternal relationship, religion and
religiosity, value orientation, and family
planning. After a careful examination of
the results of these studies, the authors
have found very little evidence of uniformity and consistency in the findings of
the studies.

 

However, a general notion that many
studies support is that traditional values
and beliefs and low socioeconomic status
generally encourage high fertility; on the
other hand, modern values and opinions
and high socioeconomic status modify the
high fertility norms and subsequently lead
to the fertility reduction. With this general idea as a basis, survey data have been
analyzed to study relationships between
various facets of life styles and fertility
norms and practices of urban, rural, and
tribal populations of a southern province
of Iran. The paper specifically aims to
report and discuss the findings concerning
the following areas: (1) differential fertility among urban, rural, and tribal
groups; (2) correlates of fertility differences within each of the three groups; and
(3) relative effects of fertility correlates
within each of the three groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data used in this report are part of
1,384 interview cases collected from the
household heads in a sample survey of
social, economic, cultural, and demographic
characteristics and attitudes of the urban,

rural, and tribal subpopulations of Fars
Province. The survey was conducted in
1968 (Paydarfar, 1974).

The city of Shiraz, the capital of Fars
Province, was the urban site. With a population of over three hundred thousand,
Shiraz ranks as the sixth largest city in
Iran after Tehran, Isfahan, Mashhad,
Tabriz, and Adaban. In many respects,
Shiraz resembles a medium-sized Western
university city and functions as a medical,
administrative, and military center for the
province and a market place for the nearby
tribal and rural population.

The urban information in the study was
collected from 1,062 household heads who
were residing in 59 randomly selected
blocks in the eight social units in Shiraz.

Four villages located in a rural area
within the Shiraz district and approximately thirty to sixty miles northwest of
Shiraz were chosen as the rural site. These
four villages were selected from a group
of forty villages located in the rural area
after the villages had been ranked according to their degree of modernization. The
four represent various degrees of modernity.

The rural information in this report
was obtained from 176 household heads in
the four villages. Twelve per cent of the
household heads were not accessible and
9 per cent of the interview cases were
omitted because of incompleteness.

Finally, information related to tribal
samples were collected from 146 household heads of Qashghae Tribe of Fars
Province. The Qashghae is the major nomadic tribe in Fars Ostan. According to
the 1966 census data, this tribe had a
population over one hundred thousand.

VARIABLES OF STUDY

Most of the studies on differential fertility undertaken in the developing coun
Social Biology

tries have explained fertility differences in
terms of social stratification variables. In
our analysis, in addition to the respondent’s
socioeconomic status, various aspects of
his life style have been hypothesized as
affecting his opinion toward family size
and his fertility behavior. Related to these
variables, response items were selected
from the interview schedule for scale and
index construction measuring various facets
of the life styles and fertility values and
behavior of the respondents in the three
subpopulations. These items are shown in
Table 1. Dependent and independent variables were constructed from these response items.

DEPENDENT VARIABLES

Demographic items (see Table 1) were
used to construct two measures of actual
fertility performance: (1) the number of
children ever born, and (2) the number of
children living. Clearly, the two are highly
related to each other. In this study, we
have used both of them to overcome the
effect of recall lapse on the reported number of children ever born.

In addition, five more dependent variables related to fertility norms are included in the analysis. They are (1) the
number of children desired by the respondent for himself, (2) number desired for
his son, and (3) number desired for his
daughter, (4) age at which a boy should
marry, and (5) age at which a girl should
marry. The purpose of including these
variables is to examine whether there is
an emergence of new values in relation to
age at marriage and ideal number of children and, if so, to identify the factors
associated with them. The traditional
values associated with these variables
(i.e., low age at marriage and large desired number of children) support a high
level of fertility. Therefore, even if there
is no change in the actual fertility, we may

look at the norms and values to see
whether any change is in the offing.

INDEPENDENT VARIABLES

Using the sociocultural and economic
response items (see Table 1), ten ordinal
scales and thirteen simple indices were
constructed as explanatory variables.
Occupation, education, educational and
occupational aspirations, indices of modernization, and traditional values (fatalism, familism, etc.) are included among
the independent variables. Factor analytic
technique was used to construct the scales.
The items with high validity and reliability and those with low invalidity were
selected for scale construction. A scale or
index score for each of the variables was
computed and assigned to each of the
respondents.

Since the data were collected for a large
cross-section of people, we have a wide
variation in the respondents’ age and the
duration of marriage. Taking the effect of
these two factors into consideration, these
variables have been used as control variables in the analysis of fertility performance.

RESULTS

The findings of this study are reported
in three sections: (1) differential fertility
among tribal, rural, and urban respondents; (2) correlates of fertility within
each of the three groups; and (3) relative
effect of fertility correlates within each of
the three groups.

DIFFERENTIAL FERTILITY AMONG TRIBAL,
RURAL, AND URBAN GROUPS

Based on studies of modernization and

fertility, two assumptions have been for
mulated as principles to guide and organize the findings of this section.

1. The urban respondents in this study
represent the modern sector; the tribal

Social Biology

group represents the traditional sector;
and the rural respondents fall between
these two groups.

2. The modern life style and value orientation encourage fertility reduction,
smaller family size, and the postponement of age at marriage; the traditional
life style and value orientation operate
in the opposite direction.

With these two assumptions as a basis,
the following three main questions are
formulated for answers and discussion in
this section:

1, Do Iranian urban groups have the smallest and the tribal group have the largest
family size?

2. Do Iranian urban groups wish the smallest family size and the tribal group the
largest family size for themselves and
their children?

3. Do Iranian urban groups prefer their
children to marry at an older age compared to the tribal group who wish a
younger age at marriage for their children?

The responses to these questions are summarized in Tables 24.

Table 2 presents the percentage distribution of number of children desired by
tribal, rural, and urban respondents.
According to the table, a clear difference
appears among the tribal, rural, and urban
subpopulations with respect to the number of desired children. The urban respondents desire fewer children and are least
likely to feel that “the more children, the
better” or that the number of children one
had was controlled by the will of God. On
the other hand, more than one-fourth of
the tribal respondents attribute the number of children to God’s will. Almost 12
per cent feel the more children, the better
life would be, and more than 14 per cent
desire six children or more.

Table 3 reports the percentage distribution of number of children desired by
tribal, rural, and urban respondents for
their children.

As the findings clearly indicate, a large
proportion of urban respondents wish their

son or daughter to have a family size of
one to three children. On the other hand,
a large proportion of the rural and tribal
respondents leave the control of family
size for their children to God’s will. The
findings in Table 3 clearly indicate that
the attitudes and value orientation of
tribal and rural populations must substantially be changed toward small family size
before a family planning program can
proceed successfully among the rural and
tribal populations.

Although the age at marriage has been
dropping in most Western countries and

rising in the Arab countries (Goode,
1969), marriages still take place at an
earlier age in Iran than in many Western
nations. Table 4 shows that tribal and
rural respondents preferred their children
to marry at a much younger age than urban respondents did. Rural respondents
desired marriage at even a younger age
than did tribal respondents.

Almost half the urban respondents
wanted their sons to be at least 24 years
of age before marriage, compared with
one-fourth of the tribal and 13 per cent
of the rural respondents. More than 31

per cent of the urban respondents wanted
their daughters to reach 20 before marriage, compared with 10 per cent of the
tribal and 3 per cent of the rural. Respondents in all three residential areas
preferred their daughters to marry younger
than their sons.

The ideal age at marriage reported by
the respondents was compared with the
actual age at marriage of the married children of the respondents. The results suggest certain discrepancies. The children of
the tribal and rural respondents tended to
marry later than the age that was considered ideal; 40 per cent of the tribal
and 15 per cent of the rural married sons
reached age 25 before marriage. A similar
trend existed for married daughters. Onethird of the tribal daughters were at least
age 20 when they married, compared with
13 per cent of the rural. The urban discrepancies between preferred and actual
ages of children at time of marriage were
the reverse. Children tended to marry earlier than the stated preferred ages. Only
28 per cent of the urban sons were 25 or

older, and only 14 per cent of the daughters were 20 or older when married.
Finally, the indices of fertility among
the tribal, rural, and urban groups were
compared to find out if they were statistically different. The null hypothesis was
that the three groups are the same in regard to various indices of fertility. To
test this hypothesis, the mean scores of
fertility indices were computed for the
three groups, and the differences between
mean scores were measured by a Z test.
The result of these operations are shown
in Table 5. The table shows the ideal
family size is highest among the tribal
groups, lowest among the urban, with the
rural group in-between. In regard to the
age of marriage, the urban group has the
highest score for both sexes, meaning that
the urban respondents prefer their children to get married at an older age than
do the tribal and rural parents. In regard
to the indices of fertility practice, the
tribal families had the largest number of
children ever born per household; urban
families, the smallest. The high tribal

and urban differences with respect to living children. The birth and death rates in
all three groups resulted in almost equal
numbers of living children per household.
The Z score values in Table 5 indicate that
in most cases the three groups are significantly different. Thus, the null hypothesis
can be safely rejected.

CORRELATE OF FERTILITY WITHIN TRIBAL,
RURAL, AND URBAN GROUPS

The above findings clearly indicate that
the tribal, rural, and urban groups are significantly different in regard to most indices of fertility attitude and behavior.
The objective of this section is to find out
if the selected 23 independent variables
significantly explain all or some of the
differential fertility within each of the
three groups.

This section is divided into two parts.
The first part reports the relationship between respondent’s general attitude toward fertility and various aspects of his
life style; the second part reports the asso
ciation between respondents’ fertility behavior and life style differences.

Fertility Attitudes—As we indicated
before, fertility attitudes are expressed in
terms of the respondent’s desired family
size for himself and his children and also
desired age of marriage for his children.
In order to measure the association and
the statistical significance of the association between indices of fertility and the
23 independent variables, we cross-tabulated them by controlling for age of
respondents. The independent variables
were categorized into three groups—high,
medium, and low scores—for the purpose of
cross-tabulation. Similarly, the dependent
variables were also grouped. The statistical
significance of the association in each case
was assessed by testing the value of the
chi-square, and the nature of association
between dependent and independent. variables was determined by Gamma coefficient.

The results of these two statistical values are presented in Table 6. An examination of Table 6 reveals that several

independent variables are significantly
associated with the number of children
desired by the head of the household
among the urban group, especially when
the respondents are 35 or more years old.
Modern material possessions, communication exposure, fatalism, education of respondent, his wife, and his parents, and
his occupation are among the variables
which show significant influence on the
desired number of children. On the other
hand, very few of the 23 variables significantly explain the variation of tribal
and rural respondents’ desired number of
children.

One may argue that the response to the
question on desired number of children
may be influenced by the past experience
of the respondent, in that his response
may more closely reflect the number he
has than it does the number he desires.
The response to the question on the desired number of children for son and
daughter should be free from this bias.
Only the independent variables explaining the variation of desired family size for
urban respondents seem to be significantly
responsible for differential attitudes of the
urban respondent toward the family size
for their children. We can see from Table 6 that only very few of the independent variables have any impact on the
desired number of children for son or
daughter within the tribal and rural
groups.

We examined the relationship between
the respondent’s opinion on desired marital
age for his children and the 23 independent variables (Table 6). Here again, we
see significant relationships only within
the urban group. Occupation, education,
communication exposure, fatalism, familism, and indices of modernization are
found to be significantly associated with
the age at which the father desires girls
and boys to marry.

Social Biology

Finally, it is significant to note that the
23 independent variables in most cases are
not significantly associated with the indices of fertility attitudes within tribal
and rural groups. In some cases they are
related, but the nature of the relationship
is inconsistent with the cases among urban
respondents. For example, within the tribal
group, there is an inverse relationship between the respondent’s degree of fatalism
and his desired family size for his daughter and also an inverse relationship between the respondent’s degree of communication exposure and desired marital age
for his son; but the opposite pattern is
found among the urban respondents. It is
also surprising that so many rural respondents with a high degree of fatalism
desire an older marital age for their
daughters.

Fertility Behavior—Fertility behavior
is measured in terms of the respondent’s
reported number of living children and
number of children ever born as related
to the couples. Simple correlation technique was applied to examine the association between fertility behavior and
various indices of life styles among the
three groups. The results are shown in
Table 7. Both indices of the fertility behavior are significantly related to most
independent variables among urban respondents. The urban respondents’ score
on modern appliances, familism, communication exposure, personal health, fatalism, respondent’s fortune ladder, educational status of respondent, his wife, and
his parent, occupational status of respondent, and duration of marriage seem to be
among the major significant variables differentiating both indices of the fertility
behavior.

Within the tribal and rural respondents,
particularly rural, only very few of the 23
independent variables explain the differential fertility. Furthermore, the effect of

Significant variables on tribal and rural
fertility behavior seem to be inconsistent
when compared to their effect on the urban
sample. For example, possession of modern
materials, exposure to modern communication media, and educational-occupational
status are positively related to the number
of living children and children ever born
among tribal respondents. But exactly the
opposite association is found between related variables among the urban respondents.

Although our tribal sample is not large
enough to have our full confidence, these
observations challenge the generality and
universality of the conventional propositions postulating an inverse relationship
between fertility and socioeconomic status
among different population sectors, at
least within a country. One explanation
may be that in the transitional period

among developing populations, the relationship between fertility and socioeconomic indices is curvilinear. In other words,
with the rise of socioeconomic conditions,
fertility increases, but as socioeconomic
conditions continue rising, fertility declines. To substantiate this observation,
we require more detailed historical data
on fertility and socioeconomic conditions.

Finally, as Table 7 shows, religiosity
and duration of marriage commonly have
a positive significant effect on both indices
of fertility behavior of tribal and rural respondents. But the religiosity loses its
effect to differentiate fertility among urban
population.

RELATIVE EFFECTS OF FERTILITY CORRELATES

As we stated briefly above, the available
evidence in the field of fertility studies
clearly substantiates the fact that the dif

ferences and change in human fertility
norms and behaviors are the function of
multiple variables. No doubt the identification and the understanding of these
variables and their relative effects on fertility must be the main objective of any
fertility study. In our study of fertility
correlates, we are limited to the analysis
of 23 independent variables. Although
these variables express the most significant
features of life style, value orientation, and
socioeconomic status of the Iranian tribal,
rural, and urban groups under study, the
selected variables do not explain all the
variance of fertility norms and behavior
within each of the three groups. Furthermore, the effect of the 23 variables on fertility differences within the three groups
are not to be equally weighed. At any
rate, the findings in the last section clearly
indicated that most of the variables individually have significant relationships with
most of the indices of fertility norms and
behavior within the three groups.

In this section, the data are analyzed to
measure: (1) the joint effect of all the
independent variables on fertility behavior; (2) the joint effect of the theoretically interrelated blocks of the variables
on the fertility behaviors; and (3) the
relative effect of the independent variables on the fertility behavior. Only two
of the fertility indices—number of living
children and number of children ever born
—were used in the analysis of data in this
section. This decision was based on the
fact that interval scale could be used only
for those two variables, making them
appropriate for the kind of statistical analysis used here. Multiple and partial correlation techniques have been used to measure the association between dependent
and independent variables.

The results of this analysis are reported
in Tables 8-11. Table 8 shows the joint
effect of all independent variables on two

indices of fertility. According to the table,
the 23 independent variables acting together explain more than 55 per cent of
the variation in the number of living children of the tribal and rural respondents.
The corresponding percentage for urban
groups is roughly 40 per cent. The amount
of explanation increases when the number
of children ever born is used as an index
of fertility within each of the three groups.
For example, more than 60 per cent of the
fertility variation within tribal and rural
groups and more than 48 per cent within
the urban groups is explained by the 23
independent variables. This increase might
be due to the fact that the first index is
also influenced by differential mortality.
A cursory glance at the list of 23 independent variables shows that several of
them are theoretically interrelated. Therefore, it would be of great interest to examine the effect of those variables taken together on the dependent variables. For
example, educational aspirations for the
son and for the daughter are indicators of
the same concept, namely, the respondent’s view on education. Similarly, the
respondent’s degree of familism, fatalism,
and religiosity are indicative of the traditional value orientation, namely, the respondent’s score on traditionalism. The
same conceptualization is true in relation
to a number of other variables. Thus,
meaningful categories were made, and the

Within the urban group, only three
blocks of the variables show significant
association. This is particularly true when
the number of children ever born is used
as an indicator among the urban respondents. These three blocks are (1) economic
satisfaction, (2) educational status of respondent, his wife, and his parents, and
(3) communication exposure.

Among the tribal group, almost the
same block of variables has a significant
relationship with the indices of fertility
behavior. But we must bear in mind that
the effect of these variables within the
tribal group is the opposite of that for the
urban group.

Table 10 generally indicates that the
respondent’s score in each group on two
sets of variables (educational background
of the respondent, his wife, and parents,
and communication exposure) more than
the other eight sets of variables individ
ually differentiate fertility behavior. Thus,
these two sets of variables plus duration of
marriage seem to be the principle variables,
at least among the three independent variables, which determine differential fertility.

Finally, the 23 independent variables
were grouped in three relatively distinct
categories, and the net effect of the other
two categories on fertility indices were
measured controlling the effect of the other
two categories. The result of this analysis
is reported in Table 11. While the sociocultural category significantly explains the
variances in the fertility experience within
tribal, rural, and urban groups, the economic category by itself seems to have an
insignificant effect in differentiating the
fertility behavior within each group. As
the table indicates, the duration of marriage within each group explains a substantial proportion of the variance. This
finding means that regardless of the socio

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

Based on 1,384 household survey cases
collected in a southern province of Iran,
this study attempts to examine the fertility attitudes and behaviors among tribal,
rural, and urban groups and to measure
the effects of various facets of the three
groups’ life styles on their fertility differences. The findings clearly indicate that
the three groups are significantly different
in regard to fertility attitudes and practices. Among the three groups, the tribe
has the highest and the urban the lowest
fertility pattern.

In terms of fertility attitudes, most of
the urban respondents, 28 per cent, wish
for 3-4 children, but a large proportion
of the tribal and rural respondents, 25
per cent, leave the decision of family size
to God’s will. The attitudes of the urban

g the effect

respondents about the ideal family size for
their children are remarkably different
from the nonurban respondents. Forty per
cent of the urban respondents desire a
family size of 3 for their children, but
most of the tribal and rural respondents,
40 and 30 per cent respectively, feel God’s
will decides family size for their children.

When the relationship between 23 selected independent variables and fertility
practices was examined within each of the
three groups, most of the variables were
significantly associated with fertility. This
pattern was consistent among the three
groups. But when the variables were controlled by the duration of marriage, the
effect of several of the independent variables disappeared. The 23 variables jointly
explain more than 60 per cent of the variation in the mean number of children ever
born within tribal and rural groups and
almost 50 per cent of the variation within
urban group. Among the 23 variables, the
duration of marriage is the first and the
sociocultural category is the second significant factor having net effect on differDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

ential fertility. Within the sociocultural
category the respondent’s score on educational background (the respondent’s own
education and that of his wife and his
parents) and communication exposure are
the main determinants of differential fertility within the three groups in Fars
Ostan.

Finally, while modern value orientation
and high socioeconomic mobility reduce
the high fertility morms and practices
among the urban Shirazi, these factors
seem to have a positive effect on the fertility pattern of the tribal population. The
direction of the relationship within the
rural group in regard to fertility and life
style is not quite clear. One plausible
hypothesis being established in fertilityrelated studies is that the improvement of
socioeconomic conditions among nonurban
sectors of developing countries will improve the nutritional conditions of the
rural population and this will reduce child
mortality and raise the mean number of
living children. The evidence in our study
not only supports this hypothesis, but also
demonstrates that the socioeconomic im

provement among tribes raises the number
of children ever born. This finding may be
surprising, but it is quite possible that at
the early stage of modernization, this phenomenon may occur, particularly among
rural and tribal respondents with high socioeconomic status who feel having a large
family is further strength to their social
and economic power. We need further evidence to prove this opinion about the
tribal and rural respondents of Iran.

In conclusion, the findings in this study
clearly indicate that the sociocultural characteristics of respondents (husbands) affect the fertility behavior of their wives
regardless of their duration of marriage.
Surprisingly, the economic characteristics
of the respondents by themselves do not
affect the fertility differences within tribal,
rural and urban groups in the Fars Province.
