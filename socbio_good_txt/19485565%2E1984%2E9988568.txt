Alternative Strategies of Fetal Sex Diagnoses
and Sex Preselection

ABSTRACT: Motives for sex control include avoidance of sex-linked disease and realization of
preferred sex compositions of children. Currently, the only wholly effective means of sex control
is diagnosis of fetal sex by mid-trimester karyotyping of amniotic fluid cells followed by corrective abortion when diagnosis is adverse. Unfortunately the delays involved in karyotyping
mean that abortion cannot be minimum-risk suction curretage. Radioimmunoassay procedures
allow somewhat earlier diagnosis and therefore less risky abortion, but entail more diagnostic
error. In the first part of the paper, several assay procedures are evaluated in terms of relative
expense as compared to karyotyping, gestational age when reliability is highest, and level of
that reliability. Later portions of the paper focus on use of radioimmunoassay to diagnose fetal
sex for purposes of regulating the sex composition of offspring. Three strategies are compared

with respect to their efficiency and expected levels of diagnosis and abortion.

Determination of fetal sex early in
pregnancy is of interest both from a family planning and a disease prevention
perspective. A number of X-linked genetic defects result in male children being afflicted with such diseases as hemophilia, muscular dystrophy, and enzyme
deficiency disorders. The incidence of
both hemophilia and muscular dystrophy is roughly 1 per 10,000 births, with
the enzyme disorders much less common. However, for families with a history of these diseases, male offspring
have a 50 per cent chance of being
afflicted. Fetal sex diagnosis and selective abortion of male fetuses for families
with a known history can prevent births
of affected males. In addition, a potentially larger group of families may wish
to use sex preselection to determine the
sex composition of offspring for reasons
of personal preference.

Sex preselection strategies will differ,
depending on the couple’s underlying
motives for regulation of the offspring’s
sex. If the couple wishes to prevent inheritance of genetically linked disorders, they will want to abort all male fetuses. Since the costs of incorrect
diagnosis of a male fetus are high, they
will want to have certain diagnosis of
males. If any errors are to be found in diagnoses, it certainly is preferred that
they be females diagnosed incorrectly as
males than the other way around. On
the other hand, couples who want to
regulate the sex composition of their
family may wish to have equal reliability
of diagnosis, but may not feel as strongly
that fetal sex diagnosis need be absolutely certain.

Currently, the only certain method of
fetal sex diagnosis is karyotyping or genetic analysis of cells cultured from a

sample of amniotic fluid. But karyotyping is expensive and involves delay in
obtaining results. The delay for diagnosis typically means that the lower cost
and lower maternal risk suction curettage type abortions cannot be employed
when the fetus is diagnosed as being of
the undesired sex. Accordingly, it is of
major interest whether any alternative
ways of diagnosis exist that are both
a cheaper and yield earlier assessments of
= fetal sex.
“A first objective of this paper is to asS sess the diagnostic utility of certain non9 invasive, nonamniotic approaches as
A well as certain assay procedures that do
oe require amniotic fluid. The principal criS teria are relative expense as compared
cs to karyotyping, gestational age when re~ liability is highest, and level of that relia‘a bility. We will consider separately reliSsabilities for diagnosis of males and
5 females, to reflect the different strate= gies identified above. Although none of

£ virtually 100 per cent accuracy, combinD ing two procedures can give 90 per cent

3 In the second part of the paper we
'S will focus on the strategies appropriate
© for controlling sex of offspring for personal reasons. We will examine the degree of diagnostic reliability and strictness of control by abortion required
when the couple wants to dictate the sex
composition of two or more children involving both sexes but do not care about
the order in which sons and daughters
come. In this section we will show how
less than 100 per cent reliable fetal sex
diagnosis increases the chance of failure
in obtaining a desired sex composition.

Additionally, a desire to minimize the
number of selective abortions will also
increase the chance of failure.

ALTERNATIVE DIAGNOSTIC
PROCEDURES

EVALUATION CRITERIA

In judging the utilities of other diagnostic procedures besides karyotyping
of amniotic fluid cells, we find three
main criteria are relevant: expense, gestational age at time of highest reliability,
and level of that reliability.

Before discussing the explicit criteria
for adopting a sex control regime, let us
first present relevant statistics for conceptions. For each pregnancy there is
roughly a 50 per cent chance of either
sex having been conceived. Kobrin and
Potter (forthcoming) show that, allowing for spontaneous abortions, the average number of pregnancies required to
result in a live birth is 1.32; thus, adoption of a sex preselection strategy doubles the number of pregnancies to 2.64
to achieve a child of a specified sex. For
each child for whom the couple regulates sex, the woman must undergo, on
the average, two diagnoses and one
abortion. This constitutes a substantial
burden of diagnosis and abortion, delay
between births, and risk associated with
abortions. Further, the burden increases with each additional regulated
birth. Clearly, it would be desirable to
reduce the burdens or risks of sex preselection for couples opting to control the
sex composition of their children.

The costs and risks are not the only
criteria by which diagnostic procedures
must be judged, however. Reliability is
perhaps the most important criterion. In
sex-linked disorders there is an unavoid

122 Findley, Potter, and Findley

able 50 per cent abortion of normal fetuses based on 100 per cent reliable sex
determination. Physicians and families
may accept this error, given the high
stakes, in disease prevention, but may
not for family planning purposes. Given
the high costs of counseling, diagnosis,
and abortion, it is unreasonable to expect either group to accept a diagnosis
which has greater than 5 to 10 per cent
error in sex determination.

If diagnosis could be performed very
early in the pregnancy—that is, no later
than the first trimester—then both the
risks from abortion and delays between
births could be reduced. However, the
currently more reliable tests require amniocentesis, which cannot be performed
much earlier than gestational week 14 or
15. Prior to this time there is too little
amniotic fluid to allow penetration of
the amniotic sac and a withdrawal of
fluid without damaging the fetus with
the needle. The culturing of cells and
their karyotyping typically consumes an
additional two or three weeks, delaying
diagnosis until the sixteenth or seventeenth week. Unfortunately, the delay
well into the second trimester increases
the abortion-related maternal mortality.

Delay to diagnosis may be reduced in
two ways: by analysis of amniotic fluid
with methods quicker than karyotyping
or by diagnosis without amniocentesis.
Presently, the more reliable fetal sex diagnosis is obtained with radioimmunoassay of amniotic sex hormones. Diagnosis is available immediately upon
amniocentesis, at about weeks 14 or 15,
still early enough for a dilation and evacuation abortion. Earlier, but less reliable, noninvasive techniques would allow lowest-risk suction curettage
abortions.

Maternal mortality from abortion in
 

 

Social Biology

creases with gestational age and further
increases with a shift to instillation-type
abortions. Up to the twelfth week of
gestation, curettage may be used to
abort a fetus. In the United States during 1972-77 the maternal mortality rate
was 1.2 per 100,000 cases for suction curettage abortions. From the thirteenth
to sixteenth week, however, dilation
and evacuation is generally used, and its
maternal mortality rate is 8.3 per
100,000, seven times higher than the
rate for curettage. After the sixteenth
week, instillation procedures may be
necessary, with a further increase in maternal mortality to 15 or 20 per 100,000.
Additionally, the risk of other major
complications is roughly 2.5 times
higher for instillation than dilation and
evacuation abortions (Cates and
Grimes, 1981; pp. 168, 172). Clearly,
later abortions pose substantially higher
risks to the mother. Both physicians and
couples may be willing to forego some
reliability in fetal sex diagnosis in order
to reduce maternal risks.

Not only do maternal risks rise with
gestational age, so do the costs of the
abortion procedures. In Providence,
Rhode Island, the 1982 cost for a dilation and evacuation abortion was $300.
Saline injection abortions are more than
twice that amount, $665; and if complications require additional hospitalization, costs further increase. For both
cost and risk reasons, couples will obviously prefer earlier diagnosis.

The key question is whether reliabilities of assay diagnoses are high enough
to justify them as definitive diagnostic
procedures, and if not, whether they are
useful as a screening device. In the latter
case, when amniotic fluid is collected for
assay, if the results are not definitive a
portion of the remaining sample may
still be used for karyotyping. Thus, it is

 
Vol. 31, No. 1-2

enough that the assays yield decisive diagnoses in the majority of instances so
that karyotyping is required only a minority of times.

NONINVASIVE PROCEDURES

Several noninvasive procedures use
as a source serum or urine samples instead of amniotic fluid. They command
the advantage of much less expense, and
one of them at least has the advantage of

emuch earlier diagnosis. The critical issue
cis again reliability of diagnosis. Unless
Sreliabilities of 90 per cent or higher are
attainable, it is hard to believe that eiAther patient or physician would have encothusiasm for basing abortion decisions
Supon them. Five techniques not relying
coon amniocentesis merit brief review.

* Sonography (ultra-sound, ectogra“=phy).—Sonography requires sufficient
cidifferentiation of the genitalia that these
"omay be distinguished with ultra-sound
procedures. According to Stocker and
‘Evens (1977), this condition is not realSized before 26-30 weeks, too late for an
oelective abortion; hence, sonography is

‘women. They found significantly higher

©heG in the serum of women with female
fetuses than of those with male ones, but
the maximum difference occurs in the
third trimester. Again, detection occurs
too late in pregnancy for the procedure
to afford an attractive basis for diagnosing fetal sex.

Endocervical smear.—As early as the
eighth week of gestation, chorionic villi
are shed and excreted through the carvix. A smear of the cervix picks up these
fetal cells which then may be analyzed
without recourse to amniocentesis.

Fetal Sex Diagnosis

123

Based on a sample of 75 women,
Phadke et al. (1979) found that fetal
cells are sloughed off and that they could
identify fetal sex by Barr body counts
and Y-fluorescence with an error rate of
1.3 per cent in the former case and 2.7
per cent in the latter. While these are
very promising findings, and should be
replicated by others, there does not appear to be published any other study
corroborating these findings. Given the
dispersion of critical values from other
sex diagnostic procedures, it seems prudent to wait until more studies have examined this procedure before recommending its use. It should be noted,
however, that Y-fluorescence has been
used to identify sex of other cell types
with a 99 per cent accuracy (Paulson et
al., 1976). We, therefore, strongly recommend additional experimentation
with the endocervical smear procedure.

FSH from urine or maternal serum.—
In their study of FSH levels among 23
women, Kulin et al. (1979) found no
significant difference in maternal urinary FSH between women with male
and female fetuses.

Plasma or serum testosterone
assay.—Several authors report studies
of fetal sex determination from maternal blood samples. The results are not
encouraging. Those researchers finding
no significant differences by fetal sex include Dawood (1981), Dawood and
Saxena (1977), and Glass and Klein
(1981). Klinga et al. (1978) do report
sex-related differences in serum peripheral testosterone. In a study of 180
women from whom samples were drawn
at 7-20 weeks of pregnancy, the women
with females had a significantly lower
plasma testosterone level (mean of 597
+ 167 pg/ml) than those with males (828
+ 298 pg/ml). But owing to the wide
scatters of individual scores, the authors

124 Findley, Potter, and Findley

were able to predict fetal sex accurately
for only 28 per cent of the males and 5
per cent of the females.

Of the five nonamniotic-fluid procedures reviewed, only the endocervical
smear meets useful standards of both reliability and timeliness. The problem is
that there is only one study of this procedure. Until there are confirmations of
the initial claims, we prefer to remain
cautious. This leaves the amniotic fluid
procedures.

ASSAYS OF AMNIOTIC FLUID

Radioimmunoassay of amniotic fluid
lowers cost and results in less delay than
karyotyping. Assay procedures are
roughly half as expensive as karyotyping
of cultured amniotic fluid cells if one
counts in the expenses associated with
the amniocentesis. Fees vary, of course,
from place to place, but the following
quoted from Providence, Rhode Island,
presumably are fairly representative.

Expenses related to karyotyping:

amniocentesis (with ultra-sound) .... $218
chromosome analysis (karyotyping) .. 260
physician counseling (two visits) ..... 100

The total comes to about $575. A radioimmunoassay of amniotic fluid testosterone costs $25, one-tenth the cost
of karyotyping, but also incurs the cost
of physician counseling ($100) and of

amniocentesis ($220), giving a total of

about $345, approximately 40 per cent
less than the cost of karyotyping. A similar set of fees quoted for 196 genetic
counseling centers in various parts of the
United States proved slightly higher,
but with a similar ratio of costs between
karyotyping and radioimmunoassay of
amniotic fluid (Myers, 1982).

While radioimmunoassay diagnoses
are less costly, they are also less reliable
than karyotyping. But this does not

Social Biology

foreclose their use, because karyotyping
may be used as a follow-up for cases
where radioimmunoassay is inconclusive. One need not do a second amniocentesis. Radioimmunoassay can be
done very quickly and uses a very small
amount of amniotic fluid, leaving a sufficient sample with which to begin the
cell culture required for karyotyping immediately after the assay, if the assay
results are inconclusive.
Radioimmunoassay procedures are
used to diagnose fetal sex from amniotic
fluid samples containing sex hormones
released by the fetus. Commonly, the
two hormones assayed are testosterone
(T), a male sex hormone, and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH), a hormone
excreted by the female reproductive system. High concentrations of testosterone in the amniotic fluid indicate a male
fetus, while high concentrations of FSH
indicate a female. Fetuses of both sexes
excrete both sex hormones, but in varying amounts. Therefore, diagnosis is not
simply determined from presence of one
or the other hormone. For this reason,
assay diagnoses are based on a range of
testosterone or FSH values which span
values found for 90-100 per cent of the
male and female fetuses. Unfortunately, the male and female ranges of
possible testosterone or FSH concentrations overlap, so radioimmunoassay diagnoses are not 100 per cent accurate.
A controversy surrounding radioimmunoassays of amniotic fluid is the need
for chromotography. Some investigators insist on its necessity for best results
(Diztler et al., 1979). However, more
researchers waive it than employ it; and
in the 13 studies whose results are enumerated in Table 1, there appears to be
little connection between use of chromotography and the separation of values between male and female fetuses.

Perhaps more important is the gestational age at time of amniocentesis.
Most studies do not consider timing of
amniocentesis as an independent variable and lump subsamples whose range
of gestational ages spans 4 to 6 weeks
and sometimes more. A few report differences in amniotic fluid testosterone
by gestational age and sex of the fetus.
Three of these studies (Dodinval
and Duvivier, 1980; Kunzig et al., 1977
and Zondek et al., 1977) report increases in male testosterone concentrations at least through weeks 15-16; but
after that time results differ among the
studies. Kunzig et al. (1977) report a
significant drop in male testosterone af
ter the twentieth week, with the decline
commencing in the sixteenth week. Dodinval and Duvivier (1980) concur with
this finding. Dawood and Saxena
(1977), Dawood (1981), and Zondek et
al. (1977) disagree, showing continued
increases in male testosterone through
the 20-24 week period. Belisle et al.
(1977) find no correlation between testosterone levels and gestational age during weeks 14-20. On balance, the studles indicate a rise in male AFT through
weeks 15-16 at least, so that assays performed at this time are likely to show the
greatest difference between male and
female testosterone levels.

Absolute male testosterone levels are

126 Findley, Potter, and Findley

more variable from study to study. In
addition to fetal age differences, this
variability reflects the use of different
radioimmunoassay kits which are sensitive to a variety of compounds immunologically related to testosterone. Jirasek
(1980) directly compared two assay systems and found almost a two-fold difference in mean levels. However, the separation between male and female
testosterone levels was less variable, as
there was a concomitant increase in the
standard deviation.

For these reasons, some of the radioimmunoassay procedures achieve
greater precision in fetal sex diagnosis
than others. We recommend that the
particular laboratory techniques and antibodies adopted by researchers with
high mean values and low standard deviations for mean male testosterone levels
be investigated for subsequent refinement and development of a standardized fetal sex diagnosis protocol.

Mean testosterone values (T-value)
together with associated standard deviations classified by fetal sex for 13 studies
are collected into Table 1. Given as well
are Sample sizes, gestational age ranges,
and use of chromotography. Despite the
wide distributions of individual Tvalues, virtually all studies report a
mean female value of 200 pg/ml or less
and most studies report means of 100 or
less. In contrast, the means reported for
males are mainly 200 pg/ml and above.

Due to a strong positive skewness,
the distribution of values associated
with male fetuses generates a much
larger standard deviation than do values
associated with future daughters, which
are much more peaked and less skewed
in distribution. The magnitudes of
standard deviation are sufficient to yield
appreciable overlap between the two

Social Biology

sets of scores. These distributional characteristics argue against constructing
confidence intervals for diagnosing male
fetuses.

An alternative approach is to stipulate a single cutting point and for any
value below or above it predict daughters and sons, respectively, inevitably
with acertain amount of error. Belisle et
al. (1977), claiming 96 per cent accuracy
for male diagnoses and 94 per cent for
females, proposed 240 as the appropriate criterion point. Using this value,
Doran et al. (1980) found 91 per cent of
values below 240 associated with females and 93 per cent of values above
240 with males. Thus, the single cutpoint of 240 could be adopted to determine fetal sex accurately for 92 per cent
of all cases.

Thanks to such a large sample and
the distributional detail given, the study
of Doran et al. (1980) commands particular interest. In this investigation all values below 162 are associated with females and all values above 338 with
males. However, 55 per cent of the 812
assays have scores lying between these
cutoffs. Utilized as a screening device in
a two-stage procedure, testosterone
would yield a decisive diagnosis 45 per
cent of the time; but 55 per cent of the
time certain diagnosis would require
subsequent karyotyping.

Radioimmunoassay can also be employed to measure the concentration in
amniotic fluid of follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH). Of 353 amniotic specimens assayed for FSH as well as for testosterone, Doran et al. (1980) found
that all FSH values less than 7.6 were associated with males, while scores above
10.9 showed a monopoly of females. By
coincidence, 55 per cent of the scores
again fell in-between. Male-associated
 

Vol. 31, No. 1-2

FSH values proved markedly peaked,

while the female-associated values man
ifested a strong positive skewness. Unlike the T-values, both male and female
fetuses share the same modal values of

FSH, namely 7.6 to 10.9. While any

FSH-values above 10.9 would clearly be

associated with females, any below 10.9

could be either sex. Thus, if FSH-values

alone were used, there could be no cer
tain diagnosis of males, which ill-serves
in the needs for certain male fetal sex diagS nosis among couples with a history of
5 sex-linked disorders.

The results obtained in the Doran et
al. (1980) study differ somewhat from
those reported earlier by Belisle et al.

(1977). The latter found that all values
+ greater than 9 pg/ml were associated
with female fetuses, but the distribution
for males was more concentrated over
lower FSH-values than that obtained in
the Doran et al. study. Where most
male fetuses in the Doran et al. (1980)
e study were associated with FSH-values
> of 7.6 to 10.9, 88 percent of the patients
with male fetuses in the Belisle et al.
study had values of 2.0 pg/ml or less.
Given the discrepancy in assay values
found for males in the two studies, it
seems wise to use FSH-values to diagnose fetal sex only in conjunction with
other tests.

With little additional time or cost,
both testosterone and FSH may be assayed from one amniotic fluid sample.
When T-values fall into the inconclusive
gray zone, FSH-values may allow definitive sex diagnosis. In the Belisle et al.
study, seventeen cases could not be
definitively diagnosed by T-value, but
an additional 6 out of 9 males and 3 out
of 8 females were diagnosed by FSHvalues. Likewise, Doran et al. (1980)
find that the per cent of cases identified
by either T or FSH-value is only 45%,

127

but when both T and FSH-values are
employed, the proportion with accurate
diagnosis is raised to 71 per cent.

It turns out that the T/FSH ratios (Tvalues divided by FSH values) yield a
better separation of male and female related values than either T or FSH values
alone. For males, positively skewed, relatively high-values are being divided by
the peaked, relatively low FSH values;
whereas for females relatively peaked,
low values are being divided by relatively high, strongly right skewed FSHvalues. Previously used by Belisle et al.
(1977) and Menutti et al. (1977), the T/
FSH ratio also is employed by Doran et
al. (1980). Doran and his colleagues find
that all ratios below 2.2 are exclusively
linked with females; those above 3.4 are
all male associated; while only 20 per
cent of the ratios fall in between. Thus
when the T/FSH ratio is used, the number of indeterminate cases is reduced
from 55 per cent to 20 per cent, an impressive reduction.

The Doran et al. (1980) study included such a large number of cases (353
with both T and FSH assays) that the T/
FSH ratio distributions obtained in this
study can be considered quite representative of the values that will be obtained.
By converting the fine-grained histograms presented in their report into cumulative frequency distributions we
have been able to examine alternative
decision criteria. Due to the pronounced skev: and spread in the righttail of the male T/FSH ratios (see Table
2), it is not appropriate to calculate a
confidence interval for the male frequencies. For the females, however, the
distribution is very nearly normal, although there is some positive kurtosis.
Therefore, we can calculate a meaningful confidence interval around the mean
female T/FSH value. Our interest fo

cuses on the upper range of the interval
where male and female T/FSH ratios
may overlap. The 95 per cent confidence
interval extends up to 2.61 for females,
but because of the slight spread evidenced in the right tail of the distribution, 7 per cent of the female fetuses had
ratios higher than this value. Similarly, 6
per cent of the males have values lower
than 2.64 and would have been misdiagnosed.

Alternative strategies can be designed that would yield different degrees of diagnostic accuracy. If virtually
100 per cent accuracy is required, the associated “certainty” strategy calls for
backstopping with karyotyping any T/
FSH ratio within the overlap zone of 2.2
through 3.4. If a 5 per cent chance of error in diagnosis of females is tolerated,
backstopping would be required for any
T/FSH value between 2.61 and 3.4. If
backstopping with karyotyping is only
employed for ratios in this range, the diagnostic error is approximately equal at
6 per cent for males and females. If the
risk of error is increased to 10 per cent
for females, however, the cutpoint of

Social Biology

2.41 yields a more reliable diagnosis of
male than female fetuses. Without any
karyotyping to backstop diagnoses, this
cutpoint of 2.41 results in a 9 per cent error in diagnoses of female fetuses, but
only 4 per cent for males. The cutpoint
of 2.41 yields an average diagnostic error of 6.4 per cent for both sexes, the
minimum average chance of error for
use of T/FSH ratios without karyotyping. If this degree of error is not acceptable, only the 100 per cent certainty
strategy of backstopping for any T/FSH
value between 2.2 and 3.4 may be employed.

For couples who do not require a certain diagnosis, a combination of T and
FSH values may be used to diagnose fetal sex. Depending on which test statistics are used, couples may choose to risk
5 to 10 per cent error in fetal sex diagnosis. Given the lower cost and lower maternal health risks associated with use of
the assay procedures, this level of reliability may be acceptable to couples using
fetal sex diagnosis and elective abortion
to regulate the sex of their children.

Couples wishing to avoid male births
at-risk for sex-linked diseases have two
options. They may still use radioimmunoassay of testosterone and FSH, but
using cutpoints where males are always
identified but some females are mistakenly identified as males. For example,
the Doran et al. data suggest a cut point
of 2.0 for T/FSH values. Any above this
are taken to be male, but since 18 per
cent of the female fetuses were associated with values of 2.1 or more, some females would be mistakenly aborted. In
exchange for this increased chance of
aborting female fetuses, the earlier diagnosis permits a substantial reduction in
maternal health risks. Alternatively, the
couple may use karyotyping to verify
any fetal sex diagnosis which falls within

 
Vol. 31, No. 1-2

the inconclusive gray zone for T, FSH,
or T/FSH values. This would guarantee
that no females are mistakenly aborted,
but at a cost of greater expense and
health risk.

NEED FOR VERIFICATION BY
KARYOTYPING

In the two-stage procedure where T
values or else T/FSH ratios are acceptable alone only if deemed decisive and

‘otherwise must be verified by karyotypsing, how often must the double procedure be invoked? According to the
Fresults of Doran et al. (1980), it is about
o») and 20 per cent of the time, respecCtively. Let us translate these percentcages into the risk of karyotyping expected by each individual for each
“regulated pregnancy. This conversion

of diagnosed pregnancies per regulated

per cent backup rate) or 0.40 (2 times a
backup rate of 0.20) karyotypings per
regulated birth, dependent on whether
T-values or T/FSH ratios are employed.

However, the dispersion around
these expected values is apprectable.
Suppose T-values are being employed.
The probability of requiring h diagnosed

while the hth pregnancy is of the sex desired is, under our simplifying assumptions, (0.5)"~1 (0.5) = (0.5)". Given h

probability of having to backstop with i
karyotypings becomes (*) (0.55)!
(0.45)"-#, valid fori=0,1,..., A,
since 0.55 is the risk per diagnosed pregnancy of needing karyotyping while 0.45
represents the complementary probability of not needing it. The absolute probability P(j) of requiring j karyotypings is
asum of joint probabilities, namely, the
joint probabilities of requiring A pregnancies of which j call for karyotyping.
The number of pregnancies h for j karyotypings must be at least j but may be
higher. Thus,

P(j) => (0.5)*(#) (0.55) / (0.45)*7,

Based on this formula, the probabilities of requiring 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or
more karyotypings turn out to be 0.29,
0.46, 0.16, 0.06, 0.02, and 0.01. The modal experience is one karyotyping.
Three per cent will be unlucky enough
to require four or more in order to
achieve one birth of the desired sex.
Only 29 per cent escape karyotyping altogether.

A much more favorable picture is
seen when T/FSH ratios are used in
place of T values. Then the risk of requiring a karyotyping per diagnosed
pregnancy is reduced from 0.55 to 0.20
while the complementary probability of
escaping karyotyping per pregnancy is
raised from 0.45 to 0.80. Making these
substitutions in the formulas above we
find that the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5 or more karyotypings are now
0.67, 0.28, 0.05, 0.01, 0.00, and 0.00.

The modal experience is now no karyotyping. Under 10 per cent require
two or more karyotypings.

Obviously the latter set of probabilities presents a much more favorable picture. The effect of ignoring late spontaneous terminations of favorably
diagnosed pregnancies is to underestimate slightly both the mean and dispersion of numbers of karyotypings. The
fact that the true sex ratio slightly favors
males means that the quest for a daughter slightly inflates the average frequency and dispersion of karyotypings
as compared to seeking a son. An important fact, however, is that the number of karyotypings per regulated birth
can be expected to vary substantially
from woman to woman as a function of
chance.

SEX PRESELECTION
STRATEGIES

In this section of the paper we focus
on the use of radioimmunoassay to diagnose fetal sex for purposes of regulating
the sex composition of offspring. Previous work (Kobrin and Potter, forthcoming) has presented estimates of the
numbers of diagnoses and elective abortions required to achieve alternative
compositional goals when sex diagnosis
is 100 percent reliable. When the couple
want to dictate the order of arrival of
sons and daughters as well as their composition, obviously they must regulate
the sex of each child. If they are indifferent about the order of arrival, then given
100 per cent reliable diagnoses, they
may attain their compositional goal
while waiving sex control efforts until
such time as only sons or only daughters
remain outstanding. The former strategy which controls the sex of all off
 

Social Biology

spring may be labeled the abortionmaximizing or A-max strategy. The
opposite strategy of least control compatible with a compositional goal will be
called A-min since it is expressly designed to minimize the numbers of diagnoses and abortions. We now extend
previous analysis to reflect the fallible
and unequal reliabilities of diagnosis
which accompany the use of T, FSH, or
T/FSH values without verification by karyotyping. It turns out that there is a
third strategy which is intermediate between the A-min and A-max decision
rules in its demands for diagnosis and
corrective abortion but which under certain conditions equals the efficiency of
A-max strategy.

As the couple has successive births,
the residual composition of their children still wanted is changing. At some
point, sooner or later, it becomes singlesex, with one or more children outstanding belonging to a single sex. Let us call
this residual composition, the “‘singlesex outstanding residual composition,”
or “SS-residual” for short. Whenever all
outstanding children are of a single sex,
every subsequent pregnancy must be
regulated, that is, diagnosed for fetal sex
and aborted if the diagnosis is adverse.

The probability of attaining a sex
compositional goal under fallible diagnosis 1s sensitive to the number of children outstanding in the single sex residual. The higher the number, the less
likely the couple is to achieve its goal if
diagnostic procedures are not 100 per
cent accurate. Moreover, if diagnostic
reliability varies as a function of the true
sex of the fetus, then the proportion succeeding 1s also sensitive to how often the
single sex residual represents the sex
that is more reliably diagnosed. If male
diagnoses are more reliable and males

 
Vol. 31, No. 1-2

are also more likely, the failure rate is
lower if males are the sex of the single
sex residual.

That strategy which aims at reducing
the desired number of children remaining when they are all of one sex will entail more diagnosis and abortion than an
A-min policy but less than the A-max
decision rule. Essentially, this new rule,
which we call the moderate control or
A-mod strategy, enjoins diagnostic and
‘€ontrol efforts whenever the number of
Soys and girls outstanding are unequal.

e intent is to keep the residual numBers of sons and daughters within one of
gach other so as to insure, as far as possi
le, that when the SS-residual is reached
sthe number of outstanding births is only
sone.
— It turns out that the A-max strategy,
With sex control efforts applied to every
Pregnancy, is necessary if one wishes
‘Both to minimize the size of the SSgesidual and to maximize chances that
“the sex it represents is the more reliably
giagnosed one. Even when the out‘Standing numbers of sons and daughters
are equal, the couple must try to have
the next child representing that sex

hich is the less reliably diagnosed so
‘that they are left with an extra outstand"gng member of the sex which is more re‘Hably diagnosed.
= Insum, if diagnostic reliability is falliAle and unequal for the two fetal sexes,
A-max strategy must be practiced to
maximize the probability of successfully
achieving the compositional goal. If diagnostic reliabilities are fallible but
equal and therefore independent of fetal
sex, the A-mod strategy will reduce diagnostic and abortion loads relative to
A-max strategy while yielding the same
probability of success. The least diagnostic and abortion load is associated

   
  
    
  
   
   
   
  

 

Fetal Sex Diagnosis 131

with the A-min strategy, but without
controlling the numbers or sex of the
single sex-residual, it is also likely to
have a higher chance of failure. In the
next section we will explore the implications of adopting these alternative strategies for all family compositional goals
with four or fewer children.

RELATIVE EFFICIENCIES OF
THE STRATEGIES

_A central question that physicians
and couples must answer before adopting any one of these strategies is how
much risk are they willing to undertake
in order to achieve the couple’s family
compositional goals. Although the diagnostic procedures are fairly low-risk,
elective abortion may not be. We have
shown that the health risk can be reduced by adopting the radioimmunoassay procedures which enable earlier diagnosis, but this is at a cost of fallible
diagnosis and a chance of failure to attain a desired compositional goal. For
any bisexual compositional goal, the
couple may opt for stricter control, at a
greater health risk to the mother, or less
stringent control, at a greater chance of
failure to obtain the desired goal. In this
section we examine the relative costs
and risks associated with adopting the
A-min, A-mod, or A-max strategies.
The real issue is whether the A-mod
strategy, much less the A-max strategy,
increases the probability of success
enough to justify the considerably
heavier diagnostic and abortion loads
necessitated by the increased control.

To answer the question, we employ
an extension of the analysis found in Kobrin and Potter (forthcoming) to evaluate the average outcomes of A-min, Amod, and A-max for all bisexual

compositional goals comprised of four
children or less, conditional on two levels of diagnostic reliability: (i) 0.90 for

‘all diagnoses, and (ii) 0.90 for female

diagnoses and 0.95 for male. Case (i)
somewhat exaggerates the unreliability
reported for the T values of the Doran et
al. (1980) sample, whereas Case (ii)
slightly exaggerates the sex dependent
inequalities of unreliability reported
with use of the T/FSH ratio. We are intentionally conservative in our assumptions, not wishing to overstate the reductions in diagnostic cost or burden
enabled by use of RIA procedures. In
this section the analysis scheme is briefly
described; results are covered in the
next section.

Several simplifying assumptions are
necessary for convenient analysis. They
are:

1. Each diagnosis of fetal sex is interpretable and of the reliabilities specified.

2. Risks of “early” and “‘late” spontaneous abortion (i.e., before and after the
time of amniocentesis) are constant
among women and over the histories of
individual women. Given that these diagnoses are done during weeks 15-16 and
any corrective abortions by week 20,
these spontaneous abortion risks are 0.15
and 0.02, respectively.

3. The fetal sex ratio at time of diagnosis equals 105, identical to the sex ratio
at birth. This is equivalent to male and female proportions of 0.512 and 0.488.

4. Plural births are insignificant in
number.

5. Compositional goals remain fixed
and couples attempt to realize them regardless of intermediate outcomes including number of elective abortions or
delays between births.

6. Couples are able to have as many
pregnancies as are demanded by the conjunction of their compositional goal, their
chosen strategy, and diagnostic outcomes.

Justifications for assumptions 1, 3,
and 4 are cited in Kobrin and Potter

 

Social Biology

(forthcoming) and for assumption 2 in
Bongaarts and Potter (forthcoming).
Clearly assumptions 5 and 6 are unrealistic; but the intent is not plausible predictions of behavior, but rather to explore consequences, were couples to
persist with and be physiologically able
to follow through with stated sex compositional goals regardless of diagnostic
and abortion demands encountered
along the way.

To illustrate the method of analysis,
let us assume that the reliability of a
daughter diagnosis is 0.90, that of a son
diagnosis, 0.95 (Case ii). Suppose further that the compositional goal is one
boy and one girl. Under the A-min strategy control efforts are waived until after
the first birth. the probability of the first
born being a boy is 0.512 and given that
event, the probability of manipulating
affairs so that the second child is a girl is
0.90. Correspondingly, the likelihood of
first a girl and then a boy is (0.488)
(0.950). Taken over these two familybuilding paths, the probability of realizing the compositional goal is P =
(0.512) (0.900) + (0.488) (0.950) =
0.924. For either family-building path,
the size of the SS-residual is 1.0; hence,
the mean size of the SS-residual is 1.0.
The number of regulated births, that ts,
births for which control efforts have to
be undertaken, is 1.0 for both paths and
therefore the overall average number of
regulated births, R, 1s 1.0. Asa final statistic, the proportion male of the SSresidual’s, M, coinciding with the more
reliably diagnosed male sex, is 0.488.
This is the probability of having a girl
first, which leaves an SS-residual consisting of a single male.

In the present case, the A-mod strategy is one and the same as A-min strategy since the couple starts with the same
number of outstanding sons and daughDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 31, No. 1-2

ters, namely one, thereby justifying forswearing control efforts until after the
first birth. However, under the A-max
decision rule, an effort is made to have
the first child a girl so as to maximize
chances that the SS-residual will reduce
to a single male child, that being the sex
more reliably diagnosed. Because it is
regulated, the first birth has a probability of 0.90 of being a girl and 0.10 of being a boy. The second birth also has to
be regulated in order best to assure that
its sex will be opposite to that of the first
born. Accordingly, the family-building
path of a girl and then boy has probability (0.90) (0.95); that of boy followed by
girl a probability of (0.10) (0.90). Consequently the expected proportion realizing their compositional goal is P =
(0.90) (0.95) + (0.10) (0.90) = 0.945.
The average size of the SS-residuals is
again 1.0; the expected number of regulated births is 2.0. The reward for this
doubled load of diagnosis and selective
abortion is a probability of achieving the
compositional goal of one boy and one
girl that has increased from p = 0.924
under A-min or A-mod strategies to P
= 0.945 under the A-max decision rule.
The difference is made more apparent
by considering failure proportions: 1-P
= 0.055 under A-max, down from 1-P
= 0.076 under A-min or A-mod.

When the compositional goal embraces three or four children, analysis is
greatly facilitated by conceptualizing
the birth sequences as a tree diagram
whose nodes represent residual sex
compositions after each birth and whose
connecting lines feature branch probabilities. These branch probabilities multiplied together along each possible path

of family-building yield a probability for

that family history. Associated with
each family history is an attained sex
composition that either qualifies as suc
Fetal Sex Diagnosis

133

cess or failure with respect to the compositional goal. Also associated with
each family history is the number of
births involving sex control efforts as
well as the size and sex of the SSresidual.

Weighted averages taken over all
possible histories yield the results of interest, namely the proportion, P,
achieving their compositional goal, the
mean size of SS-residuals, the mean
number, R, of regulated births, and the
proportion, M, of SS-residuals, 1.e., of
the more reliably diagnosed male sex.
The mean number of diagnoses required is approximately 2R and the
mean number of selective abortions is
approximately R. (These two approximations assume a Sex ratio of 100 and ignore the possibility of a late spontaneous abortion following a favorable
diagnosis). The estimates of SS-residual .
and M help to explain the higher or
lower P values among the different
strategies’ pursuit of a common compositional goal.

Let us start with Case (i) for which reliabilities of son and daughter diagnoses
are both 0.90. Only the A-min and Amod decision rules are relevant since Amax strategy demands more diagnoses
and corrective abortions than A-mod
but cannot raise the probability of
achieving the compositional goal. The
comparisons of A-min and A-mod strategies for several compositional goals are
given in Table 3. The proportions failing
under the A-min strategy more than
double from 10 to 21 per cent as the
number of children desired increases
from 2 to 4, while failure rates remain
fairly low for higher order compositional goals under the A-mod strategy.

Except for the BG goal (one boy and
one girl wanted) when the two strategies
are operationally the same, A-mod

maintains a lower failure proportion, F,
than A-min, as seen from the first two
columns. The reason, found by juxtaposing the next two columns, is a lower
mean size of the SS-residual. When the
SS-residual is 1.0, the risk of failure is
only 0.10, whereas when the mean size
is 2.0 or 3.0 the risks of not achieving the
compositional goal climb to 1.0—0.97
= 0.19 and 1.0-0.9% = 0.271, respectively. The price paid for the lower failure proportions is higher mean numbers
of regulated births, R, this comparison
being given in the last two columns.

Finally, we ask whether the A-mod
strategy proportionately reduces the
failure rate more than it proportionately
increases the diagnostic and abortion
loads, compared to the A-min strategy.
To answer this question we calculate a
relative efficiency ratio,

Here the letters F and R signify proportions failing and mean numbers of regulated births, the subscripts identifying
the decision rule. To be relatively efficient, there should be more reduction
in the proportion failing than there are
increases in the numbers of regulated
births. If a shift to A-mod or A-max
strategy provides a more than proportionate increase in the chance of success,
given the augmented diagnostic and
abortion loads, the relative efficiency ratio will take on values exceeding one.

It is seen from the first column of Table 4 that the A-mod strategy’s costs of

more abortions are offset by greater

chances of success for families comprised of 4 or more children as the asymmetry of the goal (i.e., BBBG or
BGGG versus BBGG) is higher. Indeed, it is noteworthy that for the
BBBG and BGGG goals, the proportionate reductions of failure proportions
F are roughly the same as the proportionate augmentations of regulated
births, R.

When son and daughter diagnoses
differ in their reliabilities, the A-max
strategy, where every birth is regulated,
acquires practical interest. Consider

daughter diagnoses is again 0.90 but that
of son diagnoses has risen to 0.95. The
minimum failure proportion of 0.055 is
obtained by a SS-residual of size 1.0 and
of male sex. As Table 5 indicates, except
for the BG compositional goal, the Amod decision rule maintains lower proportions F failing than A-min strategy,
but the A-max decision rule has the lowest proportions failing. Differences
among the three decision rules tend to
increase as the number of children involved in the compositional goal is
larger and as more emphasis is placed on

 

daughters for a given number of children.

Comparison of the results given in
Tables 3 and 5 shows that the unequal
reliabilities of diagnosis of fetal sex reduce the probability of failure for all
compositional goals. Due to the increased accuracy obtained in the diagnosis of sons, the proportions failing
with compositions favoring boys are
markedly reduced. As expected, there is
little difference in failure rates for couples desiring more girls than boys.

Additional statistics helping to ex

plain the differences in failure proportions for the A-min, A-mod, and A-max
strategies using unequal reliabilities of
diagnosis are given in Table 5. Excepting the BG goal, the mean size of SSresidual is consistently lower for A-mod
than for A-min, though the proportion
male (M) of SS-residual is not always
higher. Under A-max strategy, the
mean size of the SS-residual is at least as
low as that of A-mod while the proportion of male SS-residual is consistently
appreciably higher. On the other side of
the ledger, the last three columns of Table 5 document rapid increases in mean
numbers of regulated births as one
moves from A-min to A-mod to A-max
decision rules. Clearly, the lower failure
rate of the A-max strategy is achieved at
a higher diagnostic and abortion load.
Again it is worth asking whether the
reduction in proportion failing achieved
by the A-mod over A-min strategy is as
great as the corresponding increase in
number of regulated births. The corresponding relative efficiency ratio also
may be calculated for the A-max versus
A-min decision rules. These results are
found in the last two columns of Table 4.
The efficiencies of A-mod or A-max
over A-min, measured in this fashion,
progressively increase as the number of
children involved in the compositional
goal increases and as more emphasis is
placed on daughters, for a given number
of children. The relative efficiency ratios
show that for the BG and BBG goals the
increased number of regulated births
with the A-max strategy are not offset
by sufficiently large decreases in the proportion failing. For the BGG goal, compared to the A-min strategy the relative
efficiency of the A-mod strategy also exceeds that of the A-max strategy. For all
other compositional goals, the A-max
strategy scores higher in relative ef
 

Social Biology

ficiency over the A-min rule than does
the A-mod strategy.

Comparison of the relative efficiency
ratios under conditions of equal and unequal diagnostic reliabilities shows that
the unequal reliabilities (sons, 0.95; and
daughters, 0.90) result in marked efficiency of the A-mod over A-min strategies only for compositional goals favoring girls, BGG and BGGG. For all
other goals, the more efficient use of the
A-mod strategy obtains if diagnostic reliabilities are equal, with no diagnostic
improvement for males.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Determination of fetal sex early in
pregnancy is of interest both for purposes of family planning and disease
prevention. Currently, most diagnoses
are performed by karyotyping of amniotic fluid samples drawn early in the second trimester. While yielding virtually
certain diagnoses, this procedure is both
expensive and time consuming, resulting in the need for higher risk
instillation-type abortions when the diagnosis is adverse. The objective of this
paper has been to determine whether
other techniques can be used to reliably
diagnose fetal sex and, if so, explore the
implications of their use for sex preselection strategies.

A review of the medical literature indicates that radioimmunoassay procedures meet the objectives of lower cost,
earlier diagnosis, and reasonable reliability for diagnosing fetal sex. Amniotic
fluid testosterone has been found in sev- _
eral studies to indicate fetal sex correctly
roughly 90 per cent of the time, while
the ratio of testosterone to folliclestimulating hormone yields a slightly
higher reliability (94 per cent). Since the
assay results can be known without the

delay involved in karyotyping, assay
procedures usually permit use of the
lower risk suction curretage or dilation
and evacuation type abortion if the diagnosis is adverse. If radioimmunoassays
are used instead of karyotyping, we estimate that for each diagnosis and elective
abortion the net cost savings is about
$600, while the maternal mortality risk
is reduced by at least one-half.

If virtually error-free diagnosis of fetal sex is demanded, then radioimmunoassays of amniotic fluid can be used as
a screening device backstopped by karyotyping when the assay results are inconclusive. With little expense added
and no extra time delay involved, T/
FSH ratios may be substituted for Tvalues and thereby appreciably reduce
the proportion of times that backstopping by karyotyping is necessary. In the
data of Doran et al., which has been accorded special attention in this paper,
the reduction calculated is from 55 to 20
per cent. Even at 20 per cent, however,
substantial variation in the number of
karyotypings per regulated birth must
be expected as a function of chance factors, in particular the variable number
of adverse diagnoses which dictate additional pregnancies.

Not to backstop radioimmunoassays
with karyotyping is to accept two kinds

of risk: having a child of the unwanted

sex or else accepting as valid an adverse
but inaccurate diagnosis and thereupon
deliberately interrupting a pregnancy
representing the desired fetal sex. According to the experience of Doral et al.,
the magnitude of either risk is somewhat
less than 0.10. It is worth remarking that
if a particular one of these two risks but
not the other ts acceptable to the mother
and her physician, then the expected
number of backstopping karyotypings
can be cut in half. For example, if the

woman and her medical advisor are willing to tolerate a modest risk of her having a baby of the unwanted sex, then any
assay yielding a favorable diagnosis
whether decisive or belonging to the
overlap gray area is treated as though it
were decisive and the pregnancy allowed to go to term. On the other hand,
an assay yielding an adverse diagnosis,
unless initially decisive, would be
double-checked by means of karyotyping.

If radioimmunoassay is utilized without karyotyping, the risk of diagnostic
error is several per cent, perhaps slightly
under 0.10. Although cutpoints may be
determined which result in more reliable diagnosis for one sex (male) than
another, any diagnostic unreliability increases the chance of not having one’s
children represent a desired sex composition. Suppose a couple wants b boys
and g girls, but does not care about the
order of their arrival. Is it necessary for
them to regulate the sex of all b + g
children in order to maximize chances of
attaining the desired sex composition,
or can some lesser number of births be
regulated without suffering a diminution of the probability of success? If the
reliabilities of daughter and son diagnoses may be taken as equal, and there is
presently no entirely decisive evidence
to the contrary, we have shown that one
can suspend control efforts whenever
the numbers of sons and daughters outstanding is identical without penalizing
chances of attaining one’s desired sex
composition. However, one cannot
waive control efforts until only all boys
or else all girls are outstanding without
augmenting the risk of not attaining the
desired composition. When the reliabilities of son and daughter diagnoses differ, and that sex which is more reliably
diagnosed is known, then it is necessary

to regulate the sex of all births in order
to maximize chances of realizing the
compositional goal.

These three decision rules have been
compared for all bisexual compositional
goals embracing four or fewer children.
It has been demonstrated that as the
number of children involved in the compositional goal increases from two to
four, the differences in the amounts of
diagnoses and abortion exacted by the
three strategies tends to increase, but so
do their efficiencies as represented by

 

Social Biology

the proportions of mothers attaining
their compositional goals. When strict
control of every pregnancy is applied,
the chances of failing decrease by
roughly half, compared to a strategy
which waives diagnosis and elective
abortion for some pregnancies. We also
have demonstrated that the relative efficiency of adopting a more stringent
control strategy varies with the reliability of diagnoses, as well as with the particular compositional goal.
