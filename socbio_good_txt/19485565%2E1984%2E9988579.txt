Mate Selection in Man:
Evidence, Theory, and Outcome

Department of Psychology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel

ABSTRACT: This review presents a comprehensive survey of the literature on mate selection and
in non- random mating in man. The topics discussed include: (1) genetic aspects of non-random
S mating for complex traits; (2) evidence on resemblance between spouses on a large variety of
,, traits such as intelligence, personality, physical characteristics, and sociocultural traits; (3) a
5 critical review of sociological and psychological theories offered to account for assortative mat© ing, and (4) implications of assortative mating for marital satisfaction. It is suggested that the
© factors leading to choice of marriage partners need to be studied from the point of view of multiS variate profiles rather than single traits. Such studies will require sophisticated methodologies

of research design and data analysis.

“Well, when a guy picks out a dame for
himself he’s in love with something in
himself that hasn’t got nothing to do with
the dame. She looks like his mother, or
she’s dark and he’s scared of blonds, or
maybe he’s getting even with somebody,
or maybe he ain’t quite sure he’s a man
and has to prove it. Fella that studied stuff
like that told me one time—a man don’t
fall for a dame. He falls for new roses,
and he brings his own new roses. The best
marriages are the ones pulled off by
someone that’s smart but not sucked in.”

This review of mate selection deals
with a topic of concern to geneticists, sociologists, psychologists, and anthropologists. The fact that the topic of nonrandom mating is relevant to so many
disciplines is an indication of its complexity. Theories on mate selection have
been formulated at the genetic level, at
the societal level, and at the individual
level, since the 1800’s. There has been a
great deal of interest in recent years
(Zonderman and Vandenberg, 1977;
Price and Vandenberg, 1980; Watkins
and Meredith, 1981). The most recent

review by Theissen and Gregg (1980)
limits itself to the genetic implications,
while the latest review dealing with social and psychological implications was
published in 1972 by Vandenberg. The
present paper is an updated comprehensive survey and discussion of the literature on mate selection dealing with major implications of positive non-random
mating.

The review consists of five sections:
In Section I, genetic and sociobiological
implications of assortative mating are
discussed. Section II covers evidence of
homogamy between marriage partners
for a range of variables, including age,
religion, socioeconomic status (SES),

education, mental retardation, personal

habits, and personality traits. Section I
also reviews evidence for complementariness in mate selection and empirical
data for other, less popular, theories of
non-random mating. Section III
presents a variety of sociological and
psychological theories in a review of investigators’ attempts to understand the
mechanisms behind assortative mating.
Section [V presents implications of as

sortative mating for marital satisfaction.
Finally, a general summary includes
ideas for future research on mate selection.

A discussion of assortative mating requires familiarity with terms used to describe types of non-random mate selection. We have included, at the end of the
article, an appendix with short definitions of terms that appear in the mate selection literature.

J. GENETIC IMPLICATIONS OF
ASSORTATIVE MATING

Since assortative mating in man deals
with complex traits, it is reasonable to
assume that there is little mate selection
for traits determined by single genes. Indeed, Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer
(1971) have stated that “there are almost no examples of assortative mating
in man for simple genetic markers.”
Therefore this discussion is not concerned with non-random mating and
single gene effects (for an excellent discussion on this topic see Cavalli-Sforza
and Bodmer, 1971).

For polygenic characters, in the absence of differential fertility, positive assortment (1) increases the frequency of
genotypes that result in more extreme
phenotypic traits, thus increasing variance of the trait in the population (negative assortment decreases the population variance), and (2) increases
parent-child and sibling correlations
(Crow and Felsenstein, 1968). According to Jensen, (1980), assortative mating
is expected to increase only slightly the
amount of homozygosity in a population, leaving the mean value of a trait
unchanged. Crow and Felsenstein
(1968) also suggest that “‘unless the
number of loci is small or the degree of

Epstein and Guttman

 

Social Biology

assortative mating is very intense, there
would be only a very slight increase in
homozygosity.” In their opinion, there
should be a much larger effect on the
population variance, due to linkage disequilibrium.

The genetic effects of assortative
mating may be modified by differential
fertility. The evolutionary consequences of differential fertility and assortative mating have been discussed in
detail by Eckland (172), as well as by
Thiessen and Gregg (1980). Positive assortment with differential fertility may
result in a change in gene frequencies
and may thus affect the genetic structure
of the population in which it occurs
(Eckland, 1968). According to Eckland
(1972), assortative mating could be
higher, for instance, at upper and lower
levels of intelligence. He hypothesizes
that if fertility is associated with these
extreme regions of the distribution, then
assortative mating should pressure for
natural selection of extremes. In other
words, assortative mating would tend to
“amplify the genetic effects of fertility
and other selection pressures by increasing the genetic variance of the traits assorted for.”” The example presented in
Eckland’s paper (1972) deals with intelligence, which is undoubtedly tn part genetically determined (Plomin and DeFries, 1980; Bouchard and McGue,
1981).

While Eckland (1972) shows projected graphs of the relative contributions of fertility and mortality to the opportunity for selection, he also states
that he knows of “‘no polygenic model of
inheritance which has been developed
to account for the joint effects of assortative mating and differential fertility on
human evolution” (Eckland, 1972, p.
304).

A. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ASSORTATIVE
MATING AND FERTILITY

Clark and Spuhler (1959) have reported low but consistent correlations
between mate similarity for anthropometric traits and fecundity. Spuhler
(1967) also presented consistently positive correlations between positive assortment and fecundity for two intelli
‘9 gence measures, Raven’s Progressive
& Matrices and Thurstone’s Primary Men6 tal Abilities Test.

There is also some evidence for a relationship between mate similarity in
educational attainment and fertility.
This will be discussed in more detail in a
later section (II.A.2.). On the whole,
the evidence on assortative mating and
fertility is limited, and to some extent,
conflicting.

B. SOCIOoBIOLOGICAL THEORY ON
MATING STRATEGIES

According to sociobiological theory
(Wilson, 1975), mating strategies which
are considered adaptive are those that
result in successful gene duplication.
Thus, traits in potential mates which
maximize one’s own gene replication
are considered to have high fitness and
are targets of mate choice. Since offspring receive 50 per cent of each parent’s genetic material, individuals may
optimize gene transmission by mating
with others who have similar genes, so
as to gain in gene duplication without increasing reproductive investment
(Theissen and Gregg, 1980).

The concept of fitness implies that the
best strategy for gene transmission
would be incest, since the expectation of
a child from a brother-sister, fatherdaughter, or mother-son mating would
be 25 per cent of shared genes (i.e., the

Mate Selection in Man

245

coefficient of inbreeding (F) is 0.25).
Thus, it seems illogical at first glance
that incestual relations are considered
cacogamous in all human societies
(Lindzey, 1967). Inbreeding, however,
is selected against because of its deleterious effects. Inbreeding increases the
probability of producing homozygous,
recessive, harmful characteristics, thus
increasing the risk of genetic defects in
the progeny, especially for single-gene
characteristics. For polygenic traits, inbreeding lowers the mean surviving
number of the inbred progeny (depending on directional dominance of the
trait). This effect is called inbreeding depression (see Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971).

There is considerable evidence on the
deleterious effect of first-cousin marriages on both single-gene~determined
and polygenic traits. The outstanding
example of a major-gene behavioral
trait is phenylketonuria (Stern, 1973). A
certain amount of inbreeding depression has also been reported for intelligence in first-cousin marriages (Stern,
1973).

Thus, natural selection against inbreeding depression may serve as the restraining influence on incest (Lindzey,
1967). Positive assortment among nonrelatives may be the genetic strategy to
maximize gene representation in future
generations while avoiding depression
in Darwinian fitness resulting from incest (Theissen and Gregg, 1980).

In accordance with sociobiological
theory—as described above—we may
summarize that individuals will base
their mate choice on gene similarity, up
to the point where increased homozygosity will reduce Darwinian fitness. In
addition, Theissen and Gregg (1980)
predict that in order to capitalize on

246

gene homogamy existing between partners, while avoiding excessive homozygosity, mates will strongly assort on
traits low in additive genetic variance
(see Table 1).

Il. NON-RANDOM MATING IN
MAN: EVIDENCE

A. HoMoGAMy

Historically, researchers first gathered empirical evidence to support
claims of homogamy in marriage choice.
Later, research was done on choice of
complementary, rather than homogamous, partners. Other theories were
then suggested, most of which were
more complex, “combinations” of homogamy and complementarity.

As empirical data accumulated, theories of the process of mate selection
were offered, that is, why we choose
alike or opposite partners, and how we
go about choosing them. All these theories include sociological and/or psychological explanations. So far, no one theory has been accepted as the final
answer on mate selection. A great number of empirical studies, however, do reveal a pattern of similarity between partners across a large number of
characteristics. Most theories, consequently, attempt to account for homogamy in mate selection.

Epstein and Guttman

 

Social Biology

In this section we will review empirical evidence for homogamous, complementary, and mixed patterns. Theories
offered to account for these patterns will
be presented in Section III. The vast majority of the studies show homogamous
mating patterns.

1. Intelligence.—Studies on spouse
similarity in intelligence and abilities go
back to 1928. In Table 2, Johnson et al.
(1980) present a summary of studies
published between 1928 and 1973. The
data presented in Table 2 are separated
into early versus recent studies. On general IQ tests, spouse correlations vary
from 0.12 to 0.76; the median of 33 studies is 0.33. Johnson et al. point out that
the mean spouse correlation for the 14
samples in 12 early studies reviewed is
0.48, and, for the 16 more recent studies, 0.30. Johnson et al. attribute this
“secular change in degree of assortative
mating for ability” to several possibilities: (1) sample differences between
early and recent studies (more recent
samples may be restricted in range,
larger, and less selected); (2) recent
tests tend to measure spatial ability
more than verbal ability, and there is
more assortative mating for verbal ability; and finally (3) there has been an actual secular change in assortative mating.

Johnson et al. conclude that “it seems
quite conceivable that an actual secular

For ability has occurred as a result of increased mobility, decreased emphasis
on some forms of selection, and other
“social changes” after World War II
that would lessen spouse similarity in
family background, ability, and educational level.

With regard to specific ability tests,

This review is primarily concerned

resemblance and does not go into studies on biometric modelling or the recent
papers on path analysis. For discussions
on the relationship between these
models and assortative mating for intelligence, the reader is referred to papers
by L. J. Eaves (1973), Rao et al. (1982),
and Cloninger (1980).

Attempts have been made to determine whether observed similarities in
intellectual abilities are assorted for at
marriage or are a function of marriage
duration. In their study (mentioned
above), Zonderman et al. (1977) partialed out “nongenetic variables” such
as age, sex, years of marriage, and number of children, in order to distinguish
between “‘assortative mating” and “‘as
sortative marriage’ (see Appendix).
Their results indicate that age accounted
for a large share of resemblance between spouses on Spatial test scores.
With regard to other abilities, their evidence suggests that after partialing out

nongenetic factors, correlations between spouses in most of the memory
and perceptual speed tests were not
changed, and verbal tests were only
slightly affected. They conclude that this
finding implies that assortative mating,
or mate selection, rather than assortative marriage, took place for these abilities.

A different approach is found in the
study by Watkins and Meredith (1981),
who examined newlyweds’ specific cognitive abilities, socioeconomic status
(SES), education, and the tendency towards convergence over marriage. They
examined 215 newlywed couples with 21
tests of specific cognitive abilities.
Watkins and Meredith’s data show that
correlations of visual and reasoning tests
tend to be largest. Those for visual
memory are zero, while correlations for
spatial and perceptual speed tests range
from 0.01 to 0.33. To measure convergence, Watkins and Meredith compared
their results from the sample of newlyweds with those of 15 of the same tests,
previously administered in the Hawaii
Family Study (Johnson et al., 1976) and
Zonderman et al.’s Colorado Study
(1977). Comparison of these three studies revealed no consistent differences
between newlyweds and the “‘lJongmarried” couples. Precisely how many
years the “long-married” couples had
been married, however, was not noted
in the Zonderman et al. (1977) study.
The mean age of the subjects was 35.4,
and the rage of ages was from 17 to 69
years. In the Hawaii study (1976), the
subjects had all been married long
enough to have a teen-aged child.!

‘A study is presently in progress in Israel, conducted jointly by Guttman and Willerman, which
aims to compare spouse resemblance of 300 couples of varying ethnic background who have been
married from zero to 20 years.

Epstein and Guttman

 

Social Biology

Summarizing correlative findings for
spouse homogamy in overall intelfigence, spouse correlations range from
0.3 to 0.6 (Jensen, 1978) and are generally higher than those for either personality or physical characteristics (see Sections 1].A.3 and II.A.4). Spouse
correlations for specific tests of cognitive ability are lower than those for general intelligence. Correlations for verbal
and reasoning skills are generally found
to be higher than those for perceptual
speed or spatial ability (Watkins and
Meredith, 1981; Johnson et al., 1976;
Zonderman et a). 1977).

2. Education and Fertility.—The correlation between level of education and
general intelligence has been reported
to be around 0.58 (Bajema, 1966). Guttman and Shoham (1983) computed
Pearson correlations between years of
schooling of male and female adults,
and their performance on eight spatial
visualization tests. Correlations ranged
from 0.18 for the Shepard-Metzler Rotation Test, to 0.55 for Raven’s Progressive Matrices and the Thurstone Test of
Analogies.

According to Jensen (1978), the
number of years of formal schooling is
(second to age) the human characteristic
for which there is the highest degree of
assortative mating. Warren (1962) collected data on more than 33,000 households in the United States and found
husband-wife correlations for education
of 0.60 for caucasoids, and 0.57 for noncaucasoids. Warren suggests that education sorts people into demographically
separate groups at marrying age.

The degree of positive assortment
may have implications for fertility (Bean
and Aiken, 1976). Using U.S. census
data for 1960, Garrison et al. (1968) and
Kiser (1968) showed that larger spouse

and smaller family size, although both
outcomes appear confounded in their
analysis.

Because trends in differential fertility
may be dependent on cohort conditions
and secular changes, and the studies reported above were done in the 1960’s
and earlier (before the days of the birth
control pill, and when fewer highly educated women pursued careers), these
findings will need to be reexamined in

minister the same personality inventory

from early studies of psychological similarity of spouses.

The correlations were generally
around 0.38-0.70 for opinions and attitudes, and 0.23-0.45 for the Allport
Vernon Scale of Values (Vandenberg,
1972). For personality variables, correlations ranged from zero (selfsufficiency) to 0.34 (neurotic tendency).

A classic study by Burgess and Wallin
(1943) on 1,000 couples showed “‘homogamy in social characteristics’ for 45
out of 51 characteristics noted. These included religious affiliation, types of family relationships, types of social participation, courtship behavior, and
concepts of marriage.

Spuhler (1967) and Vandenberg
(1972) summarize studies of assortative
mating for traits like neuroticism, extroversion, dominance, self-sufficiency,
hostility, and nurturance. Generally,
these correlations have been positive,

and range from 0.02 to 0.29. Tharp
(1963) studied “psychological patterning in marriage,” and his results also indicated homogamy. In 1967, Cattell and
Nesselroade (1967) presented an inventory of 16 personality factor measures to
102 stably-married and 37 unstablymarried couples. Significant positive
correlations in the stable group were reported for traits of intelligence, ego
Strength, surgency, super-ego strength,
parmia, autia, radicalism, and selfconcept control. Only two positive correlations, for guilt proneness and radicalism, were found for unstably-married
couples, as well as three significantly
negative correlations, affectohymia,
protension, and surgency. These results
will be discussed in Section IV, because
they relate to marital satisfaction and
homogamy.

Yom et al. (1975) administered the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory OMMPI) to 205 couples married at least five years and found a common dimension of neuroticim and
psychotism. Yom et al., however, derived their sample from couples who
were obtaining psychiatric services for
their children. This is a nonrandom sample and these results cannot be generalized to the general population.

Price and Vandenberg (1980) describe the phenotypic similarity in samples of Swedish and American couples.
Swedish couples show typically low correlations on personality variables measured by Eysenck’s neuroticismextraversion scale, the Comrey Scale,
and others. Significant correlations were
found only for locus of control (0.18)
and amount of leisure exercise (0.26).
Correlations for American couples were
significant for traits of trust (0.27), compulsiveness (0.22), social conformity
(0.20), general activity (0.22), and

Social Biology

amount of leisure exercise (0.27) and social activity (0.36).

Recently, Eysenck and Wakefield
(1981) assessed (among other variables)
personality and social attitudes of 566
couples married from one-half year to
forty years. Several of these variables
will be discussed in the section on marital satisfaction. Here, it is relevant to
note that Eysenck and Wakefield report
“little assortative mating” for personality variables. Low but significant correlations were found for psychoticism
(0.14), neuroticism (0.13) and lie scales
(0.26); higher correlations were found
for sexual attitudes: 0.43 for libido and
0.41 for sexual satisfaction. Even higher
correlations were reported for social attitudes: 0.56 for tender-mindedness and
0.51 for radicalism. Eysenck and Wakefield conclude that ‘“‘couples select
each other for similar sexual and social
attitudes and marital satisfaction itself
prior to marriage.”

Murstein (1980) reviews the data
from the 1970’s and claims that “‘assortativeness for marriage continues to be
strongly evident, with no variable having been shown to be completely independent of it. The smallest influence of
assortativeness has been found for personality and personality inadequacy.”
Murstein attributes this to courters’ lack
of access to information about personality characteristics of their potential
mates, to misleading premarital behavior when partners try to impress each
other, or to inadequacy of methodologies used to assess personality by assigning single, quantitative scores.

Eysenck and Wakefield’s (1981)
results point to perhaps a more reasonable explanation for low personality homogamy. It is possible that individuals
simply do not expect and do not want to
marry their “‘personality clone’’; rather,

 
 

 

Vol. 31, No. 3-4

other variables such as similar social attitudes (i.e., more instrumental traits)
may be the selective criteria. Of course,
it may be that a person’s attraction to
other personalities simply involves too
many factors to reduce the attraction
process to trait scales. Indeed, it seems
more reasonable to study the process
rather than the result of mate selection
for personality. That empirical findings
are consistently replicated by positive
=correlations, however, indicates that
“personality selection is not entirely rancdom.
® 1. Physical traits and physical
Auttractiveness.—In 1967, Spuhler preosented a summary of “‘studies of assortadive mating with respect to physical
<tharacteristics” published between 1902
sand 1962. Spuhler reports that in 40
samples, of 105 physical characteristics,
only 5 characteristics show correlations
“Preater than 0.5. The studies reviewed
by Spuhler include data on physical
raits ranging from stature, weight, hair
olor, and eye color, to traits like forearm measurement, and mouth form.
‘Xorrelation coefficients in the range 0.1
o 0.2 are most frequently observed for
measurements of body size in Europe“ans and Americans of European descent. Population in the Mediterranean
Sarea tend to mate assortatively for physGcal characteristics more than do populations of Northern and Western Europe.

More recently, Price and Vandenberg (1980) have reported a ‘“‘small
amount of assortment, for height and
weight . . . consistent with findings reviewed by Spuhler.”

Taking a different approach, Griffiths and Kunz (1973) tried to determine
the degree of physiognomic homogamy
among partners married from less than
one year to 35 years, by having college
students view pictures of 60 people (30

Mate Selection in Man

253

couples) and then ‘‘match” those men
and women whom they thought looked
as though they were married to one another. Respondents perceived physiognomic homogamy for married couples through approximately 10 years of
marriage. Couples married from 10 to
20 years were not perceived showing
significant physiognomic similarity,
while couples married over 20 years
were again perceived as showing significant physiognomic homogamy. Unless
we are dealing with cohort effects, Griffiths and Kunz’s results are rather
strange. It takes an active imagination to
explain why couples start out looking
alike, become dissimilar, and then look
alike once again. Their study needs replication.

This study does bring to bear an important point, that we must take into account convergence through marriage
years for physical traits. This would
probably be apparent, for example, for
physical features related to weight, since
the family pattern of household cooking
should have impact on both partners’
weight. Another point to keep in mind
while evaluating homogamy of physical
traits in marriage partners is that similarity here may be a “‘by-product” of assortative mating for ethnic background,
religion, and age.

Related to homogamy for physical
traits is research on similarity in the degree of physical attractiveness of partners. Thiessen and Gregg (1980) propose that prospective mates associate on
the basis of resemblance, especially
physical attractiveness. They also claim
that individuals express interest in others of high physical attractiveness, but in
fact associate with persons of equal attractiveness. In a study by Bersheid and
Walster (1974) of ratings by independent investigators of campus couples, no

254 Epstein and Guttman

couple showed a between-partner disparity of more than 2.5 points on a 5
point scale, and 60 per cent of the partners were within a one-half scale point
of one another. Murstein (1980) reports
that in the 1970's a great deal of research
was done on assortativeness of physical
attractiveness, and generally, assortativeness was demonstrated for both
courting or married couples. Implications of homogamy for physical attractiveness On marital satisfaction and stability will be discussed in Section IV of
this paper.

5. Age.—The data show a high degree of within-couple similarity for age.
Vandenberg (1972) reviewed findings
by Hollingshead (1950) and Rele (1965)
who reported 2.7 years to be the mean
difference in age between husbands and
wives in the United States. Jensen
(1980) considers age to be the variable
showing the highest degree of similarity
between spouses. Price and Vandenberg (1980) found correlations between
age of spouses to be 0.83 for Swedish
couples and 0.91 for American couples.
Generally, age correlations range from
0.55 to 0.99 (Johnson et al., 1976).

6. Religion and ethnic backgraund.—
Hollingshead (1950) found assortative
mating for religion to be high (0.77 contingency coefficient). Burgess and Wallin (1953) found 79.4 per cent of their
sample married someone of the same
faith. Murstein (1980) claims that, recently, religion has declined in assortativeness.

High assortativeness for religion implies high assortativeness for ethnic
background, and vice versa. Homogamy in ethnic background, like religion,
has repeatedly been found in married
couples. Kennedy (1944) found that
Catholic Irish, Polish, and Italian peoplein New Haven, Connecticut, formed

 

Social Biology

separate intramarriage groups. In Hawail, from analysis of birth records of
1,769,327 children born to a random
sample, Morton et al. (1964) have estimated an 87.9 per cent parental homogamy for ethnicity. More recently, Vandenberg (1972) and Heer (1974) have
reported that ethnic homogamy is declining as a variable in assortativeness in
the United States; nevertheless, interethnic marriages are still relatively infrequent. Monahan (1976) estimated
that the rate of black-white intermarriage in the United States rose from 1.4
per cent of the total proportion of mixed
marriages in 1963 to 2.6 percent in 1970.
He states that “it seems unlikely that the
increasing rate of black-white intermarriage will soon produce a very large
overall effect’? (McLemore, 1980, p.
313).

Racial and ethnic homogamy may be
partly a result of assortative mating for
socioeconomic status (SES), since the
two are so highly correlated. Section III
of this paper delves more deeply into
theoretical considerations in assortativeness of ethnicity.

Because of its history of large-scale
immigration since 1920, Israel represents an interesting case of changes in interethnic marriages. Tsafrir and
Halbrecht (1972) compared data on “‘intercommunity” (Ashkenazi versus nonAshkenazi) marriages collected in 196970, with data collected in 1955-57 on the
same topic by Goldschmidt et al. (1960).
An increase among Ashkenazi Jews (of
East and West European origin) in the
rate of Intercommunity marriages and
no such trend in non-Ashkenazi (Sephardi and Asian/African) Jews was reported. Tsafrir and Halbrecht attributed
this finding to the principle that the rate
of “outbreeding” in a community is inversely proportional to the relative rep
 
 

 

 

Vol. 31, No. 3-4

resentation of that community in the
population. Israeli census data from
1970 to 1981 (Statistical Abstract of Israel, 1983) show that the percentage of
the total number of marriages between
1970-81 that were between a bride from
Europe/America (or a bride whose father was from Europe/America) and a
groom from Asia/Africa (or a groom
whose father was from Asia/Africa) remained constant at 8 per cent. The per| ° .
= centage of marriages between brides (or
‘‘ daughters of men) from Asia/Africa and
5 grooms (or sons of men) from Europe/
© America also remained relatively conA stant from 1970-81: 10 per cent between
cc 1970 and 1979, and 9 per cent in 1981.
S 7. Socioeconomic status (SES).—
co Warren (1966) and Blau and Duncan
= (1967) reported homogamy for SES.
r=More recently Watkins and Meredity
5,(1981) found assortative mating for in‘3 comes of husbands and wives. Other

‘= Watkins and Meredith’s results suggest

5'a small role in marital choice, indepenS dent of education.” Instead, educaS tional level of the mates themselves is
= the primary SES variable for assortative
8 mating. Earlier data are in accordance
with this claim. According to Warren
(1966) husband-wife correlations on
SES were reduced to one-half by partialing that education.

8. Mental retardation and psychiatric
disorders.—There is evidence for assortative marriage for the 50 per cent of
mental retardates who are not too affected to marry at all. Reed and Reed
(1965) reported that of 612 married retardates, 9.4 per cent of their spouses
were also mentally retarded. This is six

Mate Selection in Man

255

times the expectation for random marriages.

Schizophrenia has also been studied
as an assortative factor in marriage.
Kallman and Mickey (1946) found the
incidence of schizophrenia in married
couples (that is, the frequency of hospitalization of both husband and wife) to
be at least twice the occurrence in the
general population of schizophrenics.
Several researchers (Gregory, 1959;
Levitt and Baker, 1964; Nielsen, 1964;
Kreitman, 1968) have found diagnostic
concordance between spouses, but the
findings are contradictory. Most recently, Gottesman and Shields (1982)
cite a morbid risk figure (i.e., the
chances of a schizophrenic’s spouse’s
also being schizophrenic) for schizophrenia of only 2 per cent for genetically
unrelated spouses of schizophrenics and
claim that ‘“‘there does not appear to be
any marked evidence for assortative
mating for overt schizophrenia in
(these) samples.” Since the criteria for
defining ‘overt schizophrenia” in both
spouses are rather strict, we have no
figure for assortative mating on a range
of schizoid traits. If the non—“‘overtschizophrenic” mates of schizophrenic
probands were given personality tests,
one might find that of these spouses a
certain proportion might show schizoid
characteristics, rather than entirely
“normal” personality profiles.

Possible reasons for mate correlations for schizophrenia have not been
addressed to any great extent in the literature, Jt is not known whether reported correlations are the result of initial mate selection or of convergence
during marriage.

There is some evidence that individuals with extreme personality traits prefer to mate with others possessing similar traits (Slater et al., 1971). This, of

 

 

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

256

course, applies only to those individuals
capable (physically and psychologically)
of establishing heterosexual relationships and reproducing.

That mentally retarded persons and
young schizophrenics generally have
difficulties in interpersonal relationships
before the child-bearing age, may account for their being negatively selected
against (Gottesman and Shields, 1982).
In other words, mental retardates and
schizophrenics who do marry tend to assort homogamously, but the paucity in
numbers of those who do marry and
bear offspring results in a generally lowered fertility among these people.

9. Family structure.—There appears
to be a relationship between the sizes of
the families of marriage partners. Beckman and Elston (1962) have shown a
significant correlation between the number of husbands’ and wives’ siblings, as
have Burgess and Wallin (1953) and also
Warren (1966). Garrison et al. (1968)
and Thiessen and Gregg (1980) point
out that the association for number of
siblings may be a secondary result of
other factors, such as educational level
and social status. One may also speculate that spouses actually prefer to marry
someone from a similar family structure, for psychological reasons.

10. Personal habits.—Spouse similarity in personal habits has been found by
Price and Vandenberg (1980) for alcohol use, smoking, and coffee or tea consumption. Commonality of diet was
found to be significant, but was surprisingly low relative to high correlations for
alcohol consumption. This would indicate that merely sitting together at meals
does not sufficiently account for similarity in drinking habits.

Using a regression model for either of
the spouses’ scores as a function of the
other’s score, Price and Vandenberg

Epstein and Guttman

 

Social Biology

found interspouse convergence over
years of marriage for amount of social
activity, and alcohol, milk, and coffee
consumption. They suggest that these
findings imply that these more plastic
variables are subject to convergence
with years of marriage rather than to initial assortment.

Sutton (1980) found a 0.33 correlation for smoking habits. This correlation
remained high even when corrected for
social class and education, which are
strongly intercorrelated with smoking.
Because the high correlation for smoking is found even before marriage, Sutton concludes that smoking may be an
important factor in selecting a mate.
This is reasonable, since smoking is a
habit that tends to bother those who
don’t smoke themselves.

Preliminary findings by Zohar (1983)
in a cross-sectional study of 120 professional Jerusalem couples married from
less than one year to twenty years show
strong divergence over years of marriage for preference in leisure time activities. For example, interspouse correlations for three groups—couples
married up to 7 years, couples married
from 7.5 to 14 years, and couples married from 14.5 to 20 years—were (respectively for the three groups): for viewing T.V., 0.28, 0.07, and —0.17; for
going to concerts, 0.81, 0.52, and 0.39;
and for time spent with friends, 0.44,
0.16,-0.47. To rule out the possibility of
a cohort effect, Zohar checked the distributions of preferences in each of the
three groups and noticed no appreciable
differences. One might investigate
whether these data are evidence for a
cohort effect in the degree of similarity
sought in a mate at initial selection, i.e.,
perhaps couples who married twenty
years ago did not marry on the basis of
similar leisure time interests, whereas

 

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 31, No. 3-4

couples who married more recently regarded similar interests in leisure time
activities as an important factor in marriage partner choice. This hypothesis
could be checked as an alternative hypothesis to convergence.

B. COMPLEMENTARITY

In 1954 Winch et al. (1954) presented
the first serious assortative mating theory alternative to the theory of homogamy. Because of this theory’s impact on
a great deal of subsequent research on
mate selection and compatibility between spouses, we present below a critical discussion of the theory and Winch et
al.’s original research.:

Winch et al. (1954) hypothesized that
although monogamy of social characteristics creates a “‘field of eligibles,” within
this field people should choose mates
whose pattern of needs is complementary to their own, to provide maximum
gratification of their own pattern of
needs. Winch et al. consider gratifications from two persons’ (A and B) interactions to be ‘‘complementary if one of
the following conditions is satisfied: 1)
the need or needs in A which are being
gratified are different in kind from the
need(s) being gratified in B; or 2) the
need(s) in A which are being gratified
are very different in intensity from the
same need in B which is also being gratified.”” Winch et al. decided that some
persons are not, while some individuals
are conscious to varying degrees of the
needs involved in their choice of a partner.

Operationally, Winch et al. used
Murray’s Need Schema and hypothesized that correlations between spouses
would be negative for the same needs
and positive for different needs. Winch
et al. administered a ‘“‘need-interview,”’
a case history interview, and an eight
 

Mate Selection in Man

257

card TAT to 25 couples, all married less
than two years. They regarded their
need-interview empirical results as supportive of the prediction that 344 interspousal correlations involving two different needs (like nurturance-succorance, abasement-autonomy, etc.)
would be positive, and that 44 interspousal correlations of the same need
(like hostility-hostility, deferencedeference, etc.) would be negative. The
investigators concluded that ‘“‘because
the data diverge so much from chance in
the direction hypothesized, the probability of the correctness of the null hypothesis is virtually infinitesimal. . . .
Thus it appears that persons like our
subjects tend to select mates whose
needs are complementary rather than
similar to their own.”

There are several problems with
Winch et al.’s methodology. In addition
to using a very small sample, they did
not calculate all of the 1,936 interspousal correlations possible with the 44
subvariables available. Thus, appraisal
of this study does not result in conclusive
findings. Winch et al.’s findings have not
been successfully replicated. Winch
himself (1958, 1962) found no support
for complementariness when he used
the TAT to assess needs (see also Karp,
1970). Vandenberg (1972) points out
that negative correlations for the same
trait hypothesized by Winch had not
been found by earlier authors.

Murstein (1976) discusses in depth
Winch’s research and mentions several
problems both with the methodology
used by Winch to support his theory and
with some conceptual aspects of the theory itself. First, Winch created a factor
bias in the selection of only 15 of all possible needs, so he chose the needs most
likely to be complementary. Murstein’s
criticism may not be justified here. Al
 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

258

though this selection procedure would
indeed encourage results favorable to
Winch’s hypothesis, it does make sense
to assume that not all needs will be complementary and thus to attempt to first
pin-point and then try empirically to test
those that might.

Murstein further criticizes Winch for
his taking the difference of a 0.10 intracouple correlation and a 0.23 correlation for randomly paired couples to indicate complementarity among married
couples. Actually, we can conclude
from this finding only that couples were
less homogamous than random couples,
but lack of homogamy does not necessarily mean complementarity. Third,
the use of TAT, according to Murstein,
with a reported reliability of 0.20, is invalid. Fourth, Murstein expresses doubt
that Winch’s sample of only 25 couples
(the source of many different analyses)
was large enough, and, furthermore, he
feels the sample comprised an atypical
group of married undergraduates. Finally, Murstein states that Winch and
his colleagues took no “elaborate precautions” needed in such a study, to
eliminate rater bias.

Murstein (1976) goes on to point out
several conceptual problems with the
theory of complementarity, such as the
need to consider nonneed determinants
of marital choice (such as the social network, and critical incidents like pregnancy), the criteria of complementarity,
and the place of ‘‘needs” in personality.
The reader is referred to Murstein’s
(1976, p. 41-73) discussion of the complementarity theory for a more in-depth
review, not indicated by the scope of this
paper. Murstein’s review includes a list
of studies on complementarity done by
other researchers, some of which will be
mentioned here.

Bowerman and Day (1956), using the

Epstein and Guttman

Social Biology

Edward’s Personal Preference Schedule
(EPPS), failed to replicate Winch’s
results supporting complementariness
in mate selection, among engaged or
“steady” couples. Murstein (1961) gave
the Locke and Wallace Marital Adjustment Scale (LWMAS), the Bass Famous Sayings Test, and the EPPS, to 20
newlywed and 48 nonnewlywed couples. His data favor neither the complementarity nor the homogamy theory,
and Murstein assumed that for “‘adequate marital adjustment some needs
require complementary components in
the marital partner, while others necessitate homogamous need patterns.”
Cattell and Nesselroade (1967),
based on results of their 1967 study mentioned earlier, report that 5 of 16 personality factors differ at the 0.05 level or
better, but the factors higher for stable
groups are “not those typically associated with better clinical adjustment,
occupational success, or group performance.” Cattell and Nesselroade discuss
the “‘completeness principle” as being
involved with desirability, that is,
“every person tends to seek in a partner
much the same set of desirables—good
looks, intelligence, etc.—but more so to
the extent that he/she lacks them.” To
adequately assess complementariness,
one should examine the “‘exchange rate
between desirables.”’ Cattell and Nesselroade are among the first authors to
implicate more complex variables related to the relatively simple-minded
homogamy and complementarity theories. Some subsequent authors elaborate on other, more complex formulations for patterning in mate selection. It
seems that neither a simple homogamy

‘nor a complementarity theory can ac
count for the multi-faceted, complex
process of mate selection for psychological variables. (For studies that atVol. 31, No. 3~4

tempted to test complementarity theory, see Schellenberg and Beek, 1960;
Barton and Cattell, 1972; Murstein,
1967; Till and Freedman, 1978).

C. MORE COMPLEX THEORIES OF MATE
SELECTION

Subsequent to the theory of complementarity, several further theories of
mate selection were proposed and empirically investigated. Goodman (1964)

“offered a hypothesis that high selfaccepting (HSA) individuals should be
Gattracted to persons like themselves,
Eand low self-accepting (LSA) persons
oshould select their mate on the basis of
complementarity. His research exStended Roscow’s (1957) consideration
~-Of self-acceptance as an intervening varlable between latent versus manifest
~needs, such that self-acceptance indiScates an individual’s having adjusted to
his basic need structure.
S  Totest his hypothesis, Goodman ad‘Sministered the Index of Adjustment and
Values and the Edward’s Personal Pret“erence Schedule (EPPS) to 75 recently
‘married couples. He found that mates in
~ HSA couples were similar in dominance
2(r=0.32), nurturance (r=0.46), and
succorance (r=0.33), while LSA coup‘gles showed inter-spousal correlations for
"= dominance (0.33), dominance and def= erence (0.33), nurturance (-0.5), and
Anurturance and succorance (0.47).
Goodman warns that the “traditional interpretation of complementarity as
based upon all needs is erroneous.”

Finally, one should mention here the
work of researchers who claim that their
evidence supports neither homogamy
nor complementarity theories and conclude that personality variables may
play no part at all in mate selection.
Udry (1967) administered personality
tests (the 16 Personality Factor (PF)

Mate Selection in Man

259

test) and mate perception tests to 150
engaged couples, who were followed up
over 5 years to determine whether they
married or broke the engagement. He
reported no differences in personality
match between the couples who eventually did marry from those who did not
marry. Bowerman and Day (1956) also
found no evidence for a homogamy or a
complementary hypothesis after testing
a group of engaged couples with the
EPPS.

Il. SOCIOLOGICAL AND
PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES OF
ASSORTATIVE MATING

Numerous theories, both sociological
and psychological, have been formulated in an attempt to explain empirical
evidence concerning homogamous,
complementary, and other hypotheses.

A. SOCIOLOGICAL THEORIES

Theoretically, perfect random mating should result, for example, in black
persons being more likely to marry
white persons and college graduates being more likely to marry high-school
drop-outs, according to these groups’
proportion within the U.S. population
(Eckland, 1968). In 1968, however, the
racial endogamy rate was 99 per cent,
while 50 to 80 per cent of all marriages
were homogamous for class. These

figures indicate assortative mating for

the above traits in the U.S. population.
Sociocultural theories attempt to explain the observed continuity of races,
religions, and classes in a society by considering variables such as propinquity,
social stratification, and class or racial
endogamy. These constitute the sociological influences on mate selection.

1. Propinquity.—Clark (1952) found
that more than 50 per cent of adults mar

ried in Columbus, Ohio, had lived
within 16 blocks of one another when
they first met. Today, one might expect
that this would not be the case, since
people of marrying age, especially college students, are more mobile than
they were in the 1940’s. Thus, these days
we look more at geographical than at
neighborhood propinquity.

In either case, propinquity’s influence in mate selection is confounded
with many other variables such as social
class, race, and shared values, since people are not randomly distributed either
in neighborhoods or at universities and
places of work. An attempt was made to
separate propinquity and homogamy of
Occupational status by Rams@y (1966) in
Norway. The study was criticized by
Eckland (1968) for equating occupational status of the bride before marriage with her social status. Morgan
(1981) used, instead, occupational status of the couples’ parents, and she suggested that ‘‘segregation provided a
structural underpinning to homogamy
as a consequence of its effect on networks of social interaction” and that
‘“‘the residential mosaic (in New
Zealand) appears to exert the major influence on the probability of initial contact through its effect on the pattern of
social contacts” (p. 919).

More modern studies are required in
different socioeconomic groups and geographic areas to assess the influence of
changing patterns of mobility on homogamy.

2. Social stratification, class endogamy, and racial endogamy.—Empirical
evidence concerning these variables was
discussed in Section IIJ.A on homogamy
for SES and education. This evidence
shows that mate selection is indeed affected by, and also tends to perpetrate,
social stratification. Eckland (1968) lists

 

Social Biology

five explanations for the persistence of
class endogamy: (1) persons from the
same class tend to marry because they
happen to share the same values, and
not because they consciously seek out
spouses from their own class; (2) the
function of distance (whether the person
of marrying age resides at his parents’
home, at a university, etc.) limits the
field of eligibles and hence restricts class
exogamy; (3) families may put pressure
on members to marry someone in their
own social stratum; (4) class endogamy
persists due to educational advantages
or disadvantages of one’s family, which
to a great extent determines one’s place
(if any) of higher education (in fact,
Eckland refers to universities as “‘matrimonial agencies’’; and (5) a function of
the ‘interlocking nature of class and
ethnicity,” so that class endogamy may
really be ethnic or racial endogamy.

In spite of recent gains by American
blacks with regard to desegregation, the
number of black-white marriages has
not increased to any large extent (Monahan, 1976). Eckland, in 1968, stated that
“racial boundaries, from the view of
mate selection, appear to be as binding
today as at any previous point in history,
since the gains that negroes have made
in the schools and at the polls during the
1960’s apparently have not softened the
color line with respect to intermarriage.” Eckland attributed this to “‘cultural and legal prohibitions.” Only in
1967, in fact, was the legal prohibition of
interracial marriage declared unconstitutional in the United States. Until
1966, only 31 states had legally permitted intermarriage (McLemore, 1980).
Eckland also suggested that “‘certain
morphological features, like skin color,
actually operate to maintain the color
line.”” According to Beckman (1902),
“even if we could eliminate all kinds of

Vol. 31, No. 34

racial prejudice by education, there
would probably still exist a discrimination process based on pigmentation
traits.” In “On the nature of prejudice,”
Gregor (1961) states that ‘“‘man shares
with the social animals a native predisposition to preferred association,” and
that “the racial differences act as a focal
point for group orientation.”

Animal studies on preferred association have emphasized the role of affective communication in social interaction. Pratt and Sackett (1967) raised
three groups of rhesus monkeys in three
different conditions: (1) one group had
contact with peers, (2) individuals in the
second group were raised in isolation
but with visual and auditory access to
one another, (3) and the third group was
raised in complete isolation. When all
three groups were allowed to associate
together freely, the monkeys raised under the same conditions approached
monkeys from the same group twice as
often as they approached those raised
under different conditions. This implies
a learned disposition to preferred association with those who share similar patterns of responding. It is reasonable that
humans also learn such predispositions,
including those for choosing a mate similar to oneself. Thus, assortative mating
would tend to isolate groups with shared
experiences, and racial characteristics
may act as markers.

As far as work done on interracial/
ethnic marriage among humans, Ahern
et al. (1981) recently published a study
on personality attributes of those marrying within versus across racial/ethnic
groups as part of the larger Hawaii
“Family Study of Cognition” (DeFries
et al., 1974; Johnson et al., 1976).
Ahern et al. found that females who
married across ethnic groups generally
scored higher in dominance than did fe

261

males who married within their own ethnic group, whereas men in a high status
level (caucasian) who married cross
ethnically were lower in dominance than

caucasian males marrying within their
own ethnic group. This finding probably
reflects hypergamy in mating. Also,
both males and females in cross-ethnic
matings were generally found to show
higher interspousal correlations for personality test scores (i.e., were more homogamous in personality) than males
and females who married within their
own ethnic groups. This may indicate
that only couples who are unusually
compatible (assuming that homogamy
implies compatibility) bother to brave
the social problems involved in crossethnic marriage. Alternately, it could
mean that persons with more extreme
personality traits, who could be those
most likely to break social molds and
cross ethnic boundaries in marriage,
would be attracted to one another.

B. PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES

i. Psychoanalytic theory of mate
selection.—Psychoanalytic theory of
mate selection is based on the Oedipal
configuration (for a review of early development of the Oedipal complex, see
Murstein, 1976, pp. 21-25) and hypothesizes that a man should seek a mate
who resembles his mother in key characteristics and that a woman’s husband
should resemble her father. More specifically, boys’ and girls’ choices of later
love objects will be influenced by their
different experiences of resolution (or
nonresojution) of their early attraction
to the opposite-sexed parent.

The boy typically resolves his conflict
over jealousy of his father and love for
his mother by identifying with his father
and repressing his wish for his mother as
a love/sex object. His “castration” anxiDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

262

ety” is sublimated to result in an independently functioning super-ego which
enables him to later choose a love object
of the ‘‘anaclitic’” type. Anaclitic love is
affection for those on whom the infant
depends for feeding and care, and is, according to Freud, generally characteristic of men. It is seen in the “man who
protects,” and in women, more rarely,
as the ‘‘nurturant woman’’ (Freud,
1949).

Alternately, the little girl, plagued
not by “‘castration anxiety” but by “‘penis envy” more gradually identifies with
the mother, but “‘penis envy” is never
really sublimated so that the girl’s superego never develops to be as strong as a
man’s. Thus, demands made on her
throughout life are harder to deal with
and she will tend to seek a mate by narcissistic love-object choice (i.e., the self
as a love object) to help preserve the integrity of this ego. The narcissistic type
of love is common among women,
claimed Freud, and is characterized by a
love choice who is (a) what she is herself, (b) what she once was, (c) what she
would like to be, or (d) someone who
was once part of herself (Freud, 1949).

According to the theory, upon activation of sexual energy at puberty the repressed Oedipal wishes are reawakened, and the adolescent transfers the
focus of his sex-wishes toward his
opposite-sexed parent onto a girlfriend
or boyfriend.

Several problems with Freudian theory of mate choice are immediately apparent. First, it does not specify, though
most later researchers on the subject
seem to assume, that the completeness
of resolution at age 4-6 of the Oedipal
complex affects the strength of one’s
later “reawakening” of the conflicts during puberty. In other words, is mate

 

Epstein and Guttman

Social Biology

choice equally affected by the early
Oedipal complex for those who had resolved their complex and successively
fused their love for both parents into a
love for the family, as for those who had
repressed unresolved conflicts?

Second, the “Oedipal complex” itself
has been documented only clinically,
and there’s no reason to assume that it
occurs universally to every child. Third,
Freud’s assumption that normal women
are passive, masochistic, and narcissistic, may be based on his observations of
a clientele of Victorian Viennese
women and cannot be generalized to a
different population of women. Fourth,
itis not clear from Freud’s exposition of
the Oedipal stage, why women choose
narcissistic love objects because of “‘penis envy.” Also, it’s not logical that
men, if they develop a tendency toward
anaclitic love, need to be the protector
rather than the protected. Fifth, how
does one measure the degree of resolution of the Oedipal complex? People
may very possibly react differently to an
unresolved Oedipal conflict. For instance, one man may seek someone who
is exactly like his mother, so as to transfer his wishes as directly as possible,
while another man might deal with his
anger at his mother for submitting sexually to his father by choosing a woman
not at all like his mother. Finally, any
generalization of ‘female love” and
“male love’ is too simplistic to account
for the complex pattern of love choice
noted by empirical studies.

Despite numerous problems with the
Oedipal theory of mate attraction, it has
been the theoretical backdrop for many
empirical studies, perhaps because it is
often noted through informal observation, that individuals’ mates do in some
ways resemble their parents. It is possiVol. 31, No. 3-4

ble that Freud’s hypothesis (“I want a
girl just like the girl that married dear
old Dad’’) may be supported in some instances, but for reasons different from
those suggested by the classical psychoanalytic view. We will review here
several studies designed to test Freudian
theory of mate selection and then will
present an alternative theory to account
for selection of mates who resemble
one’s mother and/or father.
= Hamilton and MacGowan (1929)
“found that of 100 men, 17 reported that
“their wives physically resembled their
omothers, and 94 per cent of these men
Awere happily married. Of 60 men who
creported no physical resemblance beotween their wives and mothers, only 20
cawere happy in their marriages. None of
=100 women reported physical resemroblance between their fathers and husSbands. These results may indicate a sex
‘Sdifference in relevant factors used for
Smate selection, but the results as they
‘estand are inconclusive.
& Commins (1932) approached the
sproblem differently. Based on his belief
‘cthat “the mother is the boy’s first sweetheart, and when he comes later in life to
make the choice of a second sweetheart,
‘phe will be influenced by the memory imSage of the first, and he will choose one as
‘Snear like his mother as possible,” he reaosoned that oldest sons would marry
younger women, since they would have
a ‘‘memory image” from age 4, of a
younger mother. He then inferred that
men marrying younger women should
themselves be younger than men marrying older women (ages of men were easier to find than ages of women). Commins found statistical support for his
hypothesis in the English Who’s Who.
Of 538 cases, the median age of oldest
sons at marriage was 30.64, significantly

Mate Selection in Man

263

younger than the median age of 32.44
for other sons. In 1937, Kirkpatrick,
from 768 cases from the Compendium
of American Geneology, checked the
ages of mothers, sons, and wives, and
found no evidence to support Commin’s
hypothesis.

Mangus (1936) asked 700 college females to rate fathers, other close male
relatives, male friends, and ideal mates
for interests, roles, and traits. Results
showed the ideal mate to resemble the
boyfriends more closely than did the fathers or the other male relatives; thus,
no evidence was found for the Electra
complex.

Winch (1950, 1951) reasoned that
young adults with an unresolved Oedipal complex will (1) manifest relatively
little progress in courtship, and (2) will
have conscious attitudes of preference
for the opposite-sexed parent over the
same-sexed parent. In his 1950 study he
found that sons who said they loved
their mothers more than their fathers
(or were undecided) were not as advanced in courtship as sons who claimed
to love their fathers more. Women,
however, who loved their fathers more
than their mothers (or were undecided)

made better courtship progress than

those who preferred their mothers.
Winch assumed this to be in accordance
with the Oedipal hypothesis, since “‘to
achieve their sex-roles, males must
achieve independence, which involves
loosening their Oedipal attachments to
their mothers; females, on the other
hand, need do neither. Rather, they
need only transfer their dependency
from father to husband, so it does little
harm to a woman if she remains in her
feminine Oedipus attitude. . . . She will
. . .choose her husband for his paternal
characteristics. . . .”” This assumption is

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

264 Epstein and Guttman

valid, of course, only if one accept the
premise that men must achieve independence, while women remain dependent.
This premise, to say the least, is not altogether infallible.

Winch’s results and conclusions are
confusing and unclear. Also, although
his idea is interesting, his use of selfreported preferences may not be a sensitive enough measure of the extent of resolution of the Oedipal conflict.
Furthermore, as mentioned before,
preference for one parent does not necessarily indicate an unresolved sex-wish
for either that or the other parent, since
reactions to unresolved conflicts may be
quite varied.

The literature on psychoanalytic theOry on mate selection is quite sparse
from the middle 1950’s to the middle
1970’s. In 1974, Aron et al. (1974) revived the investigation with a hypothesis
that in selecting a mate, one seeks to reenact the relationship with the oppositesexed parent. To test the hypothesis, 46
males and 52 females waiting in line at
the Marriage License Bureau in Toronto, Canada, were asked to fill out a
12-item questionnaire on their relationship with (respectively) their future
spouse, their father, and their mother.
Males’ ratings of their relationship with
their future spouses were generally similar to their relationships with their
mothers, especially in the areas of dominance and responsiveness. Females,
however, also described their relationship with the future husbands as being
most similar to the relationship with
their mothers, especially with regard to
responsiveness and trust. This indicates
that both men and women seek to repeat, in marriage, their relationship
with their mothers. The weak role of the
father in mate selection is not accounted
for here. This study does not support the

Social Biology

Oedipal hypothesis, but does support a
more parsimonious theory of parental
image, to be presented in the next section. In any case, Aron et al.’s emphasis
on relationship rather than trait variable
is an important step in testing predictions ofthe psychoanalytic theory.

Recently, an additional article on the
psychoanalytic theory of mate selection
was published by Jedlicka (1980), postulating physical resemblances of a person’s spouse to his opposite-sexed parent. Jedlicka checked ethnicity of
spouses of twice-married brides (577)
and grooms (403) of mixed heritage parentage and found a “consistent pattern
from first to second marriage: males
marry into mother’s and females marry
into father’s ethnic groups.” These findings contradict Udry’s claim that parental images will lose their importance
with time and experience with the opposite sex. The findings do support, according to Jedlicka, the psychoanalytic
theory of mate selection. Jedlicka does
not, however, review the sociocultural
variables relevant to ethnicities in Hawali and thus we do not know if his
results are a bi-product of other factors,
such as hypergamy. Also, Jedlicka does
not relate his findings of mate choice to
complexities of psychoanalytic theory.
His results, therefore, support only the
notion of general parental image influence in mate selection.

A review of the literature on psychoanalytic theory of mate choice shows
that little evidence has been found to
substantiate the quite specific and complex hypotheses offered by Freudian
Oedipal theories, as would be expected
in an attempt to empirically validate
such a complex theory. A more parsimonious theory of parental image is suggested as an alternative to account for
the evidence mentioned above. The nu

merous problems related to Freudian
theory of the Oedipal complex do not
weaken the simpler, yet more reasonable, parental image theory.

2. Parental image theories of mate
selection.—As was previously noted, it
often appears as if people marry someone who resembles their parents, either
in striking or in more subtle ways. The
question may be asked if this occurs
more frequently than would be expected by chance.

Thiessen and Gregg (1980) suggest
that individuals may ‘‘search out others
who fit an unconscious template, presumably instinctual in form . . . others
who conform to images of their parents
or siblings or who seem to be like themselves.” This is in accordance with the
“optimal discrepancy theory” of mating
to optimize fitness, mentioned in Section I. The strategy would be to select a
mate who is outside the family group (to
reduce hazards of incest) but who is similar to members of the family. In sociobiological terms, the individuals will attempt to ‘‘combine’’ as many
homologous genes as possible by assorting with mates who are similar, while
avoiding assortment among consanguineous individuals.

It appears reasonable to offer a hypothesis of mate selection based on parental or sibling images, namely, that individuals seek in their mate choice
either to duplicate or reverse earlier relationships, usually from one’s family,
since these relationships probably have
been the longest lasting and most influential.

Very few studies have directly addressed the parental image hypothesis.
Most related studies, as reviewed here,
attempt instead to test the psychoanalytic hypothesis. It is generally found
that mates are similar to ones’ parents,

Mate Selection in Man

265

but not necessarily to that of the
opposite-sexed parent. Strauss
(1946a,b) compared subjects’ descriptions of their parents with either their
fiances or spouses, on a temperament/
personality check list, and found that
the resemblance of both their parents to
their partner was greater than that of the
parents and randomly paired partners.
Using data from personal interviews of
50 women, Strauss concluded that physical resemblances between mate and either parent were not marked, nor were
there similarities in opinions and beliefs.
As Strauss states, ‘‘analysis of interview
data, while it supports the general theory that parent-images influence marital
choice, does not support the specific hypothesis that the image of the oppositesexed parent necessarily strongly influences marita] choice ... it seems
possible to speak of kinds of parentimage influence.” Strauss’s research
merits replication, with a few changes in
the methodology. It would be worthwhile to include a measure of the types
of spouses’ relationships with their parents, to see if satisfying or unsatisfying parental-child relationships influence mate selection in different
directions regarding similarity to parents.

Recently, Zei et al. (1981) published
data from the tenth [talian census that
show that women born to older fathers
tend to marry older men. They suggest
that this correlation “reflects imprinting
on young girls of their fathers’ characteristics.’ Jt is far-fetched to use these

data as evidence for imprinting in hu
mans, but they may indicate some parental influence in mate selection.

A review of the literature shows that
research on parental image has not been
popular. One reason may involve the
difficulties in gathering data from four

 
 

 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

266

related subjects (a young couple and a

set of parents). Also, personality re- :

search generally yields such low correlations, that it is risky to invest in research
that may not show considerable differences among couple-parent crosscorrelations.

3. Convergence.—In all assortative
mating studies, it is important to be
aware of the influence of changes in similarity over years of marriage of spouses’
personality traits, attitudes, habits, and
even physical traits. This tells us
whether mates initially selected each
other for homologous characteristics or
whether they became more or less similar over years of marriage as a result of
the marital experience. Most investigators who have controlled for this variable have not found convergence over
years of marriage for interests, attitudes, temperament, and intelligence.

Griffiths and Kunz (1973) found no
similarity as a function of years for physiognomic features. In 1977 Zonderman
et al. used three multiple regression
models to determine whether phenotypic convergence occurs during marriage for cognitive abilities. They found
that convergence does not occur.
Schumm (1980) administered the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale to 54 married
couples and found that the self-esteem
scores of spouses correlated moderately
(r=0.39) but “did not tend to converge
with the length of marriage, supporting
the hypothesis that mate selection processes are responsible for the observed
similarity in self-esteem between husbands and wives.”’ Unfortunately,
Schumm et al. do not note the length of
marriage of their couples. Price and
Vandenberg (1980) in their study on
spouse similarity to American and
Swedish couples found “‘an indication
that the observed similarity of spouses
for most variables is due to initial assort
Epstein and Guttman

Social Biology

ment rather than to convergence of phenotypes after initial contact.” They do
mention exceptions, including more
highly plastic variables, such as alcohol
consumption and amount of social activity. Watkins and Meredith (1981) also
report that their data suggest spouse resemblance in activities from the start,
and that resemblance changes little over
time.

Most recently, Eysenck and Wakefield (1981) found little assortative
mating for personality variables, and no
tendency for spouses to become more
alike on any variable during the course
of marriage. In general, then, it seems
that any homogamy between spouses,
especially for less plastic variables like
intellectual abilities, is assorted for initially and is not subject to convergence
over years of marriage.

4, Unconscious archetypes.—A less
popular theory of a mate selection is
mentioned by Eckland (1968). Early
scholars believed that for “reasons involving the survival of the species,”
there must be a particular woman for
each particular man. Carl Jung believed
that every man has an “anima,” an “‘archetypal form,” expressing a specific female image carried in his genes, who
“seizes him and he falls in love with
her.” There are, however, no biological
traits known to influence this type of
mate selection, and the theory remains
an interesting aside.

5. Value theory of mate selection.—
The major proponent of value theory is
Coombs (1961), according to whom
value theory explains the homogamy
tendency and encompasses or supplants
theories of propinquity, parental image,
complementary needs, and ideal mate
conception. He defines a ‘‘value”’ as
“any aspect of a situation, event, or object that is invested with a preferential
interest as bing ‘good,’ ‘bad,’ ‘desirVol. 31, No. 3-4

able,’ and the like. . . . they are modes
of organizing conduct.’’ Coombs had
hoped to consolidate the previous studies of mate selection, which were mostly
of a “descriptive nature,” into a substantial theory. In 1966 Coombs published an empirical study designed to
test the Value Theory, that “‘compatible
companions are most likely to be those
who ‘feel’ the same way about ‘impor, fant’ things, i.e., those who possess simi= — lar values . (in other words) . . . in terpersonal attraction is enhanced when

‘8 persons share or perceive themselves as

g not sufficient, factor in mate choice.

8 6. Filter and process theories.—In
1962, Kerckhoff and Davis presented a
theory of successive filters through
which possible mates “‘pass.”” From all
possible dating partners, only those who
pass through the “social background”
filter go out together. Then dates with
‘high consensus” go together, and unless they pass together through the third
filter, the “complementary filter,” they
do not consider one another as a possible spouse. Kerckhoff and Davis
(1962) studied 94 engaged or steady
couples and compared those who had

Mate Selection in Man

267

grown closer toward marriage after 7
months to those who had moved apart.
Of those high in value consensus, about
73 per cent had made courtship progress. Complementary findings were in
the predicted direction but were not as
striking as the value consensus findings.
Kerckhoff and Davis’s study is important because it focused attention at the
time on the process of mate selection
rather than on descriptive correlations
between spouses. Levinger et al. (1970)
failed to replicate Kerckhoff and Davis’s
findings; the authors attribute this lack
of cross-validation to use of different cohorts. The process filter theories need
more empirical evidence, but they are
useful in that they are more complex
than most previous, over-simplified
studies in mate selection.

7. Stimulus-value-role theory of mate
selection (SVR).—This is a process theory proported exclusively by Murstein
(1976). It is an exchange theory which
states that ‘‘in a free choice situation, attraction and interaction depend on the
exchange value of the assets and liabilities each of the parties brings to the situation.”’ Stimulus, value comparison,
and role variables influence the development of a relationship, and each is operative at different stages in the course of
courtship. The ‘‘stimulus stage”’ is initial
attraction in an open field coupled with
appraisal of one’s capability (assets) to
attract the “stimulus object.” During
the ‘‘value comparison stage,’ each
partner assesses the other’s attitudes,
religious orientation, interests, etc. If
there is value compatibility, the couple
passes to the “role stage,” in which each
partner compares his perception of what
the other’s role should be, to the other’s
behaviors, and vice-versa.

Murstein’s theory is relatively new
and has been empirically supported only
by his own findings. He claims that 15
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

268

hypotheses of his theory have received
support from his cross-sectional studies,
done mostly on college students. His is a
sequential process theory that requires
more empirical support, using samples
of more diverse subjects. A longitudinal
study would probably best suit the testing of a process theory like this.

8. Ideal mate theory.—This theory
holds that an individual eventually marries the person who most closely resembles his image of the ideal mate. This
theory is based on Kelly’s theory of interpersonal perception (Kelly, 1941),
which states that “the actual relative positions of the (spouses) on a personality
trait continuum are not as important in
determining compatibility as the belief
of the husband and wife regarding their
relative positions on these scales.”’

Udry (1967) tested 90 engaged people to see whether ideal mate images actually influence mate selection and concluded that “ideal mate images are
probably of little importance in mate selection; neither are they a salient feature
in the perception of the selected mate.”
Udry, in 1967, examined 150 engaged
couples for personality traits and mate
perception and then followed up on the
couples for 5 years to check the status of
the relationships. He found no contribution for personality match, accuracy of
mate perception, or perception of mate
similarity for either sex.

Karp et al. (1970) found evidence
from a study of 50 engaged couples to
support the hypothesis that a mate will
be seen as resembling the subject’s ideal
self rather than the actual self, where the
actual self differs from the ideal self.
This indicates that interpersonal perception does indeed influence mate selection, but may operate more on the person’s ideal-self than on his desire to
match an actual mate to an ideal mate he
may have imagined.

These studies unfortunately to not
define the factors involved in formulating an “image” of the ideal mate. This
would be useful in determining both
why people look for certain traits in a
perspective partner, and why evidence
fails to support the hypothesis that ideal
mate images influence mate choice.

9. Instrumental Theory.—Centers
(1975) proposed the “instrumental theory” of mate selection: “in the intersexual dyad formation each person seeks,
among his circle of acquaintances,
within the compass of his selfacknowledge compeers, to form a relationship with that person or those persons whose behavioral and other
resources provide (or are perceived to
provide) maximum gratification and
minimum punification for his needs.”
Centers introduces the concept of “‘genderic congruity,” which states that those
needs most typical of men should be
most correlated with needs highly typical of women.

Centers found the biggest need differential in the Edward’s Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS) among his
sample of 71 engaged individuals to be
between dominance for men and affiliation for women. He thus hypothesized
that these needs should be most highly
correlated for pre-marital couples, that
is, highly dominant men will be attracted to affiliatory women, and viceversa. Centers indeed found a high
cross-correlation (0.50) between male
dominance and female affiliation. In addition, he reported a high intracouple
correlation for sex (0.64), and affiliation
(0.56). He also had predicted, and
found, that for couples in which the man
was low in abasement, the interspouse
correlation for achievement (0.44) was
significantly higher than that for couples
in which the man was high in abasement
need (-0.01).

This theory differs from Winch’s
complementarity theory in that Centers’
predicts complementarity between different needs, rather than negative correlations on the same need. Murstein
(1980) points out that Centers’ data are
sometimes incorrectly analyzed and that
his theory is sexist. Even so, -“‘genderic
congruity theory” advances beyond the
simplicity of Winch’s theory, and further
investigation would most likely contribute to the study of mate selection.

10. = Matching — hypothesis.—
Sociologist Erving Goffman (1952) once
stated, “a proposal of marriage in our
society tends to be a way in which a man
sums up his social attributes and suggests to a woman that hers are not so
much better as to preclude a merger ona
partnership in these matters.” The “sum
of social attributes” refers to a person’s
level of social skills, attractiveness, and
“possession of other socially-valued
characteristics.”

More recently, Berkowitz (1974) has
applied Goffman’s theory to the matching hypothesis of mate selection. This
hypothesis represents another example
of more recent researchers’ tendency to

study the process of mate selection

(courtship and dating behavior) rather
than correlational data on married
couples. Berkowitz predicted that the
process of assortative mating will probably be the next area most intensively
studied by mate selection researchers.

IV. ASSORTATIVE MATING AND
MARITAL SATISFACTION

The study of mate selection, in addition to being inherently interesting because almost everyone eventually marries or at least engages in courtship, is
also applicable to practical domains. Information gleaned by mate selection re

search can be used by marriage and family counselors to deepen understanding
of the factors involved in marital satisfaction, or lack thereof. There exists a
voluminous literature on the quality
of marital relationships; in fact, according to Spanier and Lewis (1980), ‘“‘marital quality and related concepts. . . may
be the most frequently studied variables
in the field.’ Testimony to this is the existence of a journal expressly devoted to
marital dissatisfaction—The Journal of
Divorce! The scope of our paper here
enables us only to touch briefly on various theoretical and methodological issues involved in the study of marital
quality, and on the relationship between
assortative mating and marital satisfaction.

Marital satisfaction is usually defined
operationally, that is, either as lack of
marital dissatisfaction, or as that which
is measured by marital satisfaction
scales. McNamara and Bahr (1980)
summarize the major studies done on
marital quality as being based either on
a bipolar pleasure/pain model (satisfaction less dissatisfaction), a unipolar
model (satisfaction alone), or a “separate dimensions” model. McNamara
and Bahr themselves studied 1,618
couples to assess “‘role satisfaction and
possible role satisfaction detractors.”
Their results tend to support the third
model, since they find that lack of role
stress and role conflict do not necessarily
result in role satisfaction. As usual, the
more complex formulation seems to be
the most applicable in dealing with such
a complex phenomenon.

Other definitional problems with
marital satisfaction include the typical
lack of distinction between marital quality and marital stability. Researchers
(Hill, 1976, for example) often use the
number of couples still married after Y
number of years as a measure of high

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

270

marital quality, when in fact nothing but
marital stability should be inferred.

Also frequently assumed ts that lack
of conflict indicates marital satisfaction,
whereas a conflict-ridden relationship
must reflect unhappiness in marriage.
Absence of conflict, however, may not
be as important a factor in marital satisfaction as the way in which a couple resolves conflicts. Adequate conflict resolution may be more influential for a
healthy happy marriage, than not dealing with problems and avoiding conflicts.

It is also important in marital satisfaction research to consider the nonstatic
character of marital quality. Schram
(1979), for instance, presents a curvilinear model where marital satisfaction
decreases after the birth of the first
child, reaches a plateau (“launching
stage”), and then increases during the
post-parental stage. He cites reasons for
the post-parental rise in marital satisfaction as perhaps being due to age correlated effects, in increase with age of social desirability, the greater tendency to
report happiness the longer one is married, or finally, the effects of lessening
sex role constraints as age increases.
Another reason may be that in crosssectional research, marital satisfaction
studies on middle-age subjects are looking essentially at “‘successful” or stable
marriages, since many unsuccessful
marriages have by that time already
ended in divorce. This assumes, of
course, that stability equals success, but
it is fair to guess that the more extremely
unhappy marriages have dropped from
the sample.

A review of the literature on marital
quality shows that several researchers
have attempted to deal with the abovementioned definitional methodological
problems. Several models of marital satisfaction have been offered, but a clear

Epstein and Guttman

Social Biology

framework has not yet emerged to guide
the study of marital satisfaction. One
such attempt at theorizing was made by
Lewis and Spanier (1979) who introduced four major factors which act as
vectors on the marital dyad to result in
high or low quality and stability in marriage: tensions, attractions, alternative
attractions, and external pressures.
These are inter- and extra-dyadic forces
of which “the ultimate costs and rewards, pushes and pulls . . . will determine the quality and stability of marriage.’ Offering a related hypothesis,
Udry (1981) has recently reported that
the dimension of marital alternatives (as
defined by the existence of potential extramarital partners or spouse replacements) ‘“‘appears to be a better predictor
of marital disruption than is marital satisfaction.”” Since marital alternatives
correlate positively with one’s resources, it is reasonable that “Jack of
choice” would encourage partners to
make the best of their marriage, if they
can’t “do better.”

The reviews of Spanier and Lewis
(1980) and of McNamara and Bahr
(1980) deal with recent theories of marital satisfaction, some of which have
been briefly discussed above. We now
turn to a more specific discussion of nonrandom mating for characteristics which
may influence marital quality.

In 1935, Terman and Buttenweiser
found that couples who shared similar
professional interests reported greater
happiness than couples who did not
share professional interests. Benson
(1956), on the other hand, concluded
that engagement success and marital adjustment were not based on the couple’s
common interests, but that value consensus in “‘familialistic’”’ (as opposed to
“individualistic’”) areas was related to
engagement success.

Also in the 1950’s, several research
 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

Vol. 31, No. 3-4

ers (Preston et al., 1952; Dymond, 1954;
Corsini, 1956; Luckey, 1960) found that
congruence between self-perception
and perception by the spouse emerged
as a predictor of marital satisfaction.
These findings prompted subsequent
authors to investigate satisfaction in social roles and social identification. According to Tharp, (1963), “role theory
provides the best available framework
for investigation of psychological phenomena in marriage,” and role-specific
needs, not general personality traits,
should be studied in research on marital]
satisfaction. Tharp went on to claim that
“marital happiness is greater when both
couples conform to conventional sex
roles.” Tharp’s work needs to be replicated, since his findings could very well
be cohort-specific, and changeable with
more modern, less rigid, sex role expectations.

Cattell and Nesselroade (1967) found
significant disassortative mating in their
“unstably married” group, for the traits
“outgoingness” (-0.50), enthusiasm (—
0.40), and self-sufficiency (-0.32). In
stable marriages the wives tended to be
more introverted and the husband more
extroverted, and vice-versa for the unstable marriages. All in all, on 16 personality traits, the stable group showed
10 significantly positive correlations,
and the unstable group had, as mentioned, 3 significant negative correlations and 2 significant positive correlations (guilt proneness and radicalism).
These results support the hypothesis
that homogamy for personality between
partners encourages marital success, as
defined by a couple’s making no known
step toward marriage dissolution.

Using a bi-polar adjective check list,
the Locke-Wallace Marriage Adjustment Scale (LWMAS) (Locke and Wallace, 1959), and the Edmond’s Marital
Conventionalization Scale, Murstein

Mate Selection in Man

271

(1972) found that personality similarity
was significantly correlated wth marital
adjustment (but these correlations were
no greater for perceived similarity than
for actual similarity), that selfacceptance was significantly correlated
with marital adjustment, and that accuracy in predicting the partner’s response
was significantly correlated with marital
adjustment, as was role compatibility.
Alternately, Weigel et al. (1973) found
no relationship between congruence of
spouses’ personal constructs and marital
success., evaluated by LWMAS. They
attribute this finding to the lack of a
significant correlation between spouses
on the Locke and Wallace Scale and
suggest using a more accurate indicator
of marital success.

In their longitudinal study of marital
success and failure, Bentler and Newcomb (1978) attempted to see ‘which
personality traits, brought to the marriage by each partner, affected the subsequent outcome and quality of that
marriage four years later.”” Bentler and
Newcomb used the Bentler Psychological Inventory and the LWMAS. Their
results supported their hypothesis that
still-intact couples will have shown,
from the beginning, more similarity on
personality traits and background items
than did separated or divorced couples.
They found weaker support for the hypothesis that the still-married couples
will show greater peer-self agreement
than couples of unsuccessful marriages.
Their data show that divorced and married couples face qualitatively different
problems. Divorced couples, for example, had significantly greater problems
with sex relations, lack of mutual affection, bickering, selfishness, and desire
for independence.

Bentler and Newcomb’s study is very
useful in that its longitudinal paradigm
can successfully measure convergence

272

between partners and can also give a
more accurate account of possible factors predictive of marital success. They
present a clear picture of homogamous
and divergent traits which may influence
marital stability and quality.

Physical attractiveness and marriage
adjustment (measured by the LWMAS)
in older American couples was studied
by Peterson and Miller (1980), who
found that physical attractiveness of
wives contributes to their husband’s
marital adjustment, whereas the husband’s attractiveness was less important
for the wives’ marital adjustment. These
findings indicate that the same factors
may have different degrees of import on
men and women for marital satisfaction
and should be further studied.

Locus of control is another variable which appears to be related to marital |

satisfaction. Doherty (1981) found marital dissatisfaction to be greater in marriages in which the wife had more ‘‘external locus of control” and the husband
more “internal locus of control.”’ Doherty suggests that such cognitive personality variables be used to study the
relation between homogamy and marita] satisfaction.

Finally, Eysenck and Wakefield
(1981) have reported that sexual behavior and spouse similarity in sexual attitudes variables contributed most heavily
(62 per cent for sexual behavior and 42
per cent for sexual attitudes) to the variance of marital satisfaction. Similarity in
background (25 per cent) and personality (20 per cent) contributed moderately, and social attitudes (S per cent)
had little effect. The data also show
that the similarity effect accounted for
only 2 per cent of marital satisfaction
variance. Eysenck and Wakefield conclude that marital satisfaction would
best be studied by independently assess
Epstein and Guttman

 

Social Biology

ing each partner’s contributions to the
marriage, rather than by examining patterns of similarities or complementarities. Also, the role of sex in marital satisfaction should be further explored, since
the two sex variables accounted for most
of the variance in Eysenck and Wakefield’s study.

The research on marital quality is ridden with methodological and definitional problems, some of which have
been mentioned. The lack of a generally
accepted definition of marital satisfaction has resulted in different operational
definitions and measurements. Researchers in the field have become
aware of this problem, and several attempts, to date none conclusive, have
been made to provide theories of marital satisfaction.

V. SUMMARY

Assortative mating, in combination
with differential fertility, tends to increase the genetic variance of traits assorted for; this can alter gene and genotype frequencies of the total population.
Assortative mating without differential
fertility will not necessarily change gene
frequency in the population’s gene pool,
but will result in more extreme phenotypic traits, thus increasing the population variance for specific traits over that
of panmixia. Thus, when assortative
mating for a trait is correlated with fertility, the consequences are magnified,
so that the trait becomes more extreme
and isolated, increasing chances for selection.

Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer (197)
point out that the use of observed correlations between mates for predicting effects on genetic variation is complex because of the effects of secular trends.

 

 

 
 

Vol. 31, No. 3-4

They add that removal of the secular
trends from the correlation, as well as
removal of the fraction due to nongenotypic correlations between sociceconomic status, presents considerable difficulty.

According to sociobiological theory,
positive assortative mating may be the
optimal strategy to duplicate one’s
genes and therefore increase one’s inclusive fitness while avoiding deletert

Mate Selection in Man

273

The third section of this paper reviewed a series of sociological and psychological theories to explain assortative mating. In general, sociological
theories can account for the field of eligibles from which we pick our mate, but
beyond this, do not deal with mate
choice within the field of eligibles.

A variety of psychological explanations were presented, including psychoanalytic theories, parental image
theories, convergence, Jungian, value
theories, filter and process theories, the
SVR theory, ideal mate theory, instrumental theory, and the matching hypothesis. A survey of the research from
the 1940’s to the 1980’s indicates a trend
from pure descriptive studies of similarity and complementarity to what have
been called “‘process theories’ such as
those offered by Kerckhoff and Davis
(1962) and Murstein (1976).

The final section of this paper deals
with assortative mating and marital satisfaction in an effort to pinpoint characteristics which, when similar between
spouses, influence marital quality. Problems inherent in studying marital satisfaction, a thus far operationally defined
concept, are reviewed. Here again, personality research proved to result in inconclusive and conflicting data. More
reliable measures of marital satisfaction
are needed before successful attempts
can be made to assess influential factors
on marital quality,

It is clear that, at this point, reasons
for assortative mating are not fully understood, despite the many studies done
over the past eight years. Most of these
studies have been descriptive and have
not served to separate co-varying factors
in mate selection. Several questions,
such as the relation between assortative
mating and fertility, and assortative
mating for psychoses, remain almost en

tirely unanswered, since different studies have yielded such varying data.

Future research will need to deal with
the interrelated factors leading to one’s
mate choice. Such research will require
the simultaneous construction and analysis of complex trait patterns or profiles.
Guttman’s Facet Analysis (Shye, 1978)
presents a relevant methodology for
theory construction which is based on
careful facet design on the one hand and
on well-tested multivariate, nonmetric
procedures of data analysis on the other.
This approach ts especially useful for the
simultaneous analysis of complex trait
profiles.

The longitudinal study is of course
the best strategy for studying mate selection and changes in resemblance of marriage partners. This method ts more accurate than the cross-sectional study,
but presents a variety of technical problems.

Epstein and Guttman

Social Biology

In all research on assortative mating,
one needs to consider that assessment of
direct assortative mating for a trait under study (religion, for example) may be
confounded with assortative mating for
an associated character (i.e., ethnic
background), cohort effects, or secular

trends. In collecting and analyzing em
pirical data on assortative mating, and in
testing suggested theories of mate selection, care needs to be taken to separate
simultaneous multivariate factors in order to avoid misjudgement of the relative importance of biological, psychological, and cultural inheritance.

TERMS USED IN THE ASSORTATIVE
MatTING LITERATURE AND THEIR
DEFINITION

Admixture: cases of out-group mating in
which racial features are criteria for differentiation among mates (Eckland,
1968). See Hybridization.

Agathogamy: marriage in conformity with
societal norms (Eckland, 1968).

Assortative marriage: phenotypic correlation
between mates, including effects of convergence (Zonderman et al. 1977). See
Assortative mating.

Assortative mating: character-specific mate
selection which would not be expected to
occur by chance. Zonderman etal. (1977)
distinguish assortative mating from assortative marriage by defining the former
as the phenotypic correlation between
mates, assuming no common environmental contribution. The degree of assortative mating can be estimated by partialing out influences of nongenetic
variables from measures of assortative
marriage. In this paper, the terms “assortative mating” and “‘assortative marriage” have been used interchangeably,
since data on convergence are inconclusive. See Assortative marriage.

Cacogamy: marriages involving prohibited
deviations from societal norms. See
Agathogamy.

Conjugal mating: phenotypic assortative
mating, identifiable by nonrandom
character-specific choice of mates.

Consanguine mating: genotypic assortative
mating, which refers to inbreeding. See
Inbreeding, Incest.

Convergence: increasing similarity between
spouses over years of marriage.

Darwinian Fitness: ““The fitness of a given
genotype in a given environment is measured by its relative contribution to the
ancestry of future generations. It depends

on both fertility and survival” (Bodmer
and Cavalli-Sforza, 1976).

Dissassortative mating: negative assortment,
or mating based on trait dissimilarity.

Endogamy: an in-group form of genetic homogamy. See Incest, Consanguine mating.

Exogamy: an out-group mating which involves genetic heterogamy. See Outbreeding.

Homogamy: mate selection based on similarity between spouses.

Hybridization: cases of exogamy like admixture. See Admixture, Exogamy.

Hypergamy: refers to a female’s marrying
upward into a higher social stratum.

Hypogamy: refers to a female’s marrying
down into a lower social stratum, See Mesalliance.

Inbreeding: a form of nonrandom mating
where departure from perfect panmixia
(random mating distribution) occurs
when mates are genetically related. Inbreeding is not trait specific. See Consanguine mating, Incest, Endogamy, Cacogamy.

Incest: a special case of inbreeding, when
mates are members of the same nuclear
family (including first cousins). Incest is
the most extreme example of endogamy.
See Inbreeding, Endogamy, Consanguine mating.

Mesalliance: a marriage to someone with an
inferior position. See Hypergamy, Hypogamy.

Miscegenation: a case of exogamy, this is intermarriage between whites and negroes.
See Exogamy.

Negative assortment: mating in which there is
no similarity between mates. See Dissassortative mating.

Outbreeding: an extreme example of exogamy. See Exogamy.

Positive assortment: mate selection between
mates who are similar in one or more
traits. See Homogamy.
