ABSTRACT: This study concerns the fertility of Sherpa and Tibetan women living at altitudes over
3,400 meters in Nepal. The average completed fertility (4.77 live births) and estimated crude birth
rate (31 to 33 per 1,000) are low relative to low altitude peasant populations as well as to high
altitude Andean peasants. Environmental phenomena (hypoxia, iodine deficiency) may be associated with retarded menarchial age and high infant mortality; but the major factors causing the
low fertility appear to be cultural rather than environmental. Traditional ceremonial requirements delay the age at marriage until the mid or late twenties. Religious practices promote male
and female celibacy. Migrant females and women married to migrant males report reduced
fertility, probably because of poor nutrition and health care. Nonmigrant women living in villages
that participate extensively in the cash economy have greater access to the growing market

economy, health care, and education and report higher numbers of live births and fewer child

deaths.

The inhabitants of the Dudh Kosi River
Valley in northeastern Nepal, are generally referred to as Sherpas. The traditional
homeland of the Sherpas can be divided
into three areas: Solu, Pharak, and
Khumbu (von Furer-Haimemdorf, 1964).
Figure 1 shows the altitude and associated
vegetation types of these areas. Most of
the Khumbu population is concentrated in
six major villages, all located above 3,400
meters and below the winter snow line
(4,000 meters). The population of these
villages ranges between 250 and 800 inhabitants. Temporary settlements exist
between 4,000 and 4,800 meters, but they
are used only during the summer for agriculture and pasturage. Two large
monasteries are located near the major villages, and a number of isolated homesteads are scattered throughout the area.

In this region of severe climatic conditions and poor vegetation, the Sherpas

have traditionally depended upon a mixed
herding and agricultural base, with trading activity carried out by a small percentage of the population. There is only one
agricultural season, from early May to late
August. Potatoes, along with some
buckwheat and vegetables, are grown during this time. Although the potato is the
dietary staple of the Sherpas, considerable
time and effort are expended on the care of
yaks and crossbred stock. They provide
some meat and dairy products, but are
primarily thought of as prestige items.
Although most of the Khumbu’s inhabitants share the same culture, differences in socioeconomic status exist within
villages, and differences in acculturation
exist between villages. These differences
make it possible to examine whether the
extreme environment or intragroup cultural variation more significantly affects
Khumbu demographic structure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Two teams independently collected demographic data during 1970 and 1971.
The first survey was undertaken by two
New Zealand physicians working at a
hospital in one village. Both physicians
had resided in the area for about six
months before the survey was initiated
and were well known. With two assistants
trusted by local inhabitants, they conducted a house-to-house survey in the fall
of 1970. An effort was made to contact
and enumerate all inhabitants of the
Khumbu. A preliminary report of this
survey has been published elsewhere
(Lang and Lang, 1971). A second team,
together with different assistants, resurveyed two-thirds of one village and about
one-fourth of the other villages in the
winter and spring of 1971.

In both surveys, respondents were
asked to relate information on age, village
of birth, village of spouse’s birth, occupation, and number of marriages. Females

were asked to relate age at menarche, age
at first pregnancy, number of pregnancies,
number of live births, number of miscarriages and stillbirths, number of neonatal,
infant, and child deaths and the number,
age, and sex of living children. The resurvey also gathered data on clan affiliation,
geneology, and age at marriage. An attempt was also made to expand mortality
information beyond the childhood years.
However, a disinclination to relate the
names of dead adults prevented these data
from being systematically gathered.

The determination of age was often
problematical, both because age categories
are defined in a non-Western manner and
because of the low literacy level. However, formal Western-style education in
local schools enabled most individuals
under the age of 30 to calculate their ages
in terms of a Western calendar with reasonable accuracy (i.e., within one or two
years). The ages of older individuals were
determined by recall of important events

in the area or by relating them to the more
accurately determined ages of their children. In a few cases, ages could not be
determined. |

The possibility of falsified information
or poor recall was assessed by comparing
the responses of interviewees to the two
questionnaires. Data on age corresponded
closely until about 35 years. Thereafter,
the reporting of age is less precise, with a
one- to four-year difference existing between the two surveys. In cases where
discrepancies existed, data from the more
complete survey were utilized. Reporting
of other factors showed only minimal variation, except for the number of pregnancies, miscarriages, and stillbirths. Either
these events were not culturally recognized and therefore not remembered by
women or they were falsely related to one
or both of the survey teams. It is therefore
not possible to include these data in the
analysis.

Not every woman replied to all fertility
questions. Of all women who reported
their ages to be 15 years and older, 348
(37.0 per cent) provided menarchial data,
294 (31.2 per cent) related the age at which
they first became pregnant, and 420 (44.6
per cent) replied to questions on the number of live births, neonatal deaths, infant
deaths, child deaths, and the number of
living children.

For analytical purposes, fertility data
supplied by Khumbu women were organized by age group, residence, and socloeconomic status, Each of these, in turn,
were broken down into categories designed to reflect the impact of mountaineering on the local economy.

In recent years, mountaineering jobs
have begun to replace participation in the
traditional agrarian economy as the major
source of wealth and prestige. The presence of several high mountains (including
Mt. Everest) in the Khumbu region has
attracted many climbers, particularly

since the American Everest expedition in
1963. Because there are no roads, goods
and equipment must be carried in by porters. The extreme cold and altitude of the
area deters hiring lowlanders and has provided the Sherpas with a virtual monopoly
on the activity. It is not uncommon for a
well-outfitted mountaineering expedition
to hire as many as 250 Sherpas for a month
at a time. In addition, a growing number
of tourists hire Sherpa guides and porters
to hike with them into the Everest area.
The need for porters, mountaineers, and
tourist guides provides Sherpa men and
women with the opportunity to earn high
wages and has introduced them to new
goods, values, and attitudes.

The presence of a substantial cash reserve in the Khumbu region has induced
lowlanders to make journeys of several
days to bring food and dry goods to a
weekly market. The imported food has
provided many Sherpas with a more varied diet. Considerable sums of money are
also spent on Western clothes, kerosene,
and radios.

Not all Khumbu villages have shared
equally in the new cash economy. Of the
six major population centers in the
Khumbu, three have disproportionately
large shares of the tourist and mountaineering income. These three acculturated villages are clustered around the
major trekking route to Mt. Everest just
after it enters the Khumbu. In these villages, almost 50 per cent of the males aged
15 and older work primarily as expedition
porters and guides, while only 22 per cent
work mainly as_ traditional farmerherders. The weekly market is held in one
of these villages and is only one hour’s
walk away from the other two. Westerntrained physicians have been situated
permanently in one of the acculturated villages since 1966 and in another since 1970.
All have permanent schools.

The other three villages are more iso

lated and are less directly involved in the
cash economy and its social consequences.
In these villages, only 21 per cent of the
males aged 15 and older work primarily as
expedition porters and guides, while 55
per cent engage mainly in farming and
herding. These unacculturated villages are
located at a greater distance from the
weekly market (up to a day’s journey), and
most inhabitants have less cash to spend.
Some of these villages do not have permanent schools, and none has a resident
physician. In cases of medical emergency,
a doctor from one of the acculturated villages may be summoned.

The two Buddhist monasteries exist on
the periphery of Sherpa economic activity.
The inhabitants are supported primarily
by donations, although some of the
younger monks and nuns occasionally
serve as porters. Because of the small
sample of female respondents from the
two monasteries (21), only two residence
categories are used: acculturated villages
and unacculturated villages. Over 90 per
cent of all Khumbu women, age 15 and
over, live in one of these two village types.

Age categories were designed (1) to
orient the period of female fertility
(roughly ages 17 to 45) relative to the development of mountaineering, and (2) to
be broad enough to minimize errors associated with age recall. Mountaineering expeditions have been a major feature of
Khumbu life since the early 1960’s. Consequently, most women age 50 and older
would have ended their childbearing years
before the major expeditions began. Cultural changes associated with mountaineering occurred after the beginning
and before the completion of the fertility of
women age 30 through 49. Most women
age 29 and younger would have entered
their fertile periods after these changes began.

On the basis of the resurvey informa
et al. Social Biology
tion, we felt that two socioeconomic categories could be distinguished, using marital and migration information. The first,
referred to as Socioeconomic Category 1,
includes women, regardless of their village
of birth, married to nonmigrant men and
unmarried women living in the village of
their birth.

Marriage is a gradual process. It involves several ritual feasts and gift exchanges, culminating in a final ceremony
called zendi (von-Furer-Haimendorf,
1964). This ritual tends to occur after the
groom can persuade his father to provide
the material necessary for building a
house, land for agricultural production,
and yaks for developing a herd. Traditionally, this happens when the couple is
in their mid or late twenties, although it
may even be later. When a man decides to
yield part of his property to a son, that son
remains in the village to enjoy the material
benefits and status associated with the inheritance, as well as to participate in the
important social relationships that tie him
to his family. Although there is a preference for village endogamy, the Sherpas
also practice a system of clan exogamy
that sometimes makes it necessary for men
to seek spouses in nearby villages. Under
these circumstances, a2 woman may receive a dowry of land or goods in the village of her birth, but will move to the
village of her husband and subsequently
become economically and ritually a member of his family.

Because the great majority of nonmigrant males possess property, and because
their spouses (or unmarried daughters)
have direct access to it, women in Socioeconomic Category 1 have a disproportionately large share of the Khumbu’s material benefits.

The second category, referred to as Socioeconomic Category 2, includes women,
regardless of their village of birth, married

to migrant men and unmarried women
who are not living in the village of their
birth.

In some cases, A man may move to another village to marry.a woman who has
no brothers and who consequently will inherit her father’s property. Such marriages
are relatively rare, however. More commonly, men (sometimes with their wives)
move into a village where no family connections exist. Under these circumstances,
access to land, animals, and material
items is restricted to what migrants can
afford to purchase. Often, this is very little.

Most of the Khumbu’s residents were
born in the area and reside in the village of
their birth or one nearby. About 10 per
cent, however, were born in Tibet, and
another 2-3 per cent were born in other
regions of Nepal. Most Tibetan residents
immigrated to the Khumbu in 1959 and
were among over 6,000 migrants camping
in the area at that time (von Furer-Haimendorf, 1964). In 1970 and 1971, only
287 Tibetans remained. They comprise

183

the bulk of Socioeconomic Category 2. Of
the unmarried women in this category,
almost 60 per cent are Tibetans. Of the
married women in this category, most of
whom are Tibetan themselves, 65 per cent
have Tibetan spouses and another 8 per
cent are married to men born in another
part of Nepal, mostly the Solu or Pharak
areas. Most Tibetans, regardless of their
sex, occupy low positions in the Khumbu
social hierarchy and maintain cultural patterns that are often distinguishable from
those of larger Sherpa society. Tibetans
tend to participate in the cash economy,
rather than in the traditional Sherpa agrarian pursuits, and therefore reside primarily in acculturated villages. Many Tibetans in the acculturated villages are expedition guides or work at crafts they sell
locally. A large number of Tibetans are
also associated in some manner with local
village Gompas (Buddhist temples).
Because the great majority of migrant
males possess little property and because
Tibetan migrants of both sexes are subject
to social discrimination, women in Socio

table summarizes data from all women
who responded to fertility questions, including those residing in the two monasteries. The average age at menarche does
not differ significantly between women in
the three age groups. The average age at
first pregnancy reported by women in the
two oldest groups is similar, but it declines
somewhat among the youngest women.
The average number of live births and the
average number of surviving children increases with the age of the mother.
Offspring mortality and survivorship
data are shown in Table 3. Percentage of
infant deaths was calculated by dividing
the total number of reported deaths among
children less than one year of age by the
total number of reported live births. Percentage of child deaths was calculated by
dividing the total! number of reported

calculated by dividing the total number of
living children by the total number of reported live births. The percentage of infant deaths added to the percentage of
child deaths and to the percentage of surviving children may not total 100 per cent
because of deaths in adolescence and early
adulthood. This is mainly true for women
in the oldest age group, all of whose 333
surviving children are over age 12 (average age, 21.9 years). The children of
women in the two youngest age groups are
mostly under age 12. For this reason, the
responses of women age 50 and older
probably provide a more accurate understanding of survivorship through childhood.

rates is not possible. Three estimates of the
crude birth rate are therefore used, and
the results are presented in Table 4. One
estimate 1s obtained from the reverse survival method (Davis, 1951); a second employs the stable population model developed by Lotka (Coale and Demeny, 1966);
a third proceeds by assuming that the
population is stationary (Weiss, 1973).

It is possible to use the average figure
for infant deaths (15.8 per cent), calculated from the responses of all women, to
estimate survivorship through the first
year of life 7, = 0.842). This figure is the
basis of the reverse survivorship calculations presented in Table 4. Survivorship
estimates necessary for the stable and stationary population models are based on
the present age and sex proportions of the
Sherpa population. Age-specific fertility
rates, necessary for the stable population
model, are based on the reproductive histories of women aged 50 and older (Weitz,
1973).

et al. Social Biology

slightly different set of circumstances
about the population, they can only be
expected to provide a general indication of
fertility rates. It is unlikely, for example,
that the Sherpa represent a stationary
population, and the estimate based on the
assumption (24.2 births per 1,000 people)
is therefore probably too low. Estimates
based on the reverse survivorship method
(33.5 births per 1,000 people) and on the
stable population model (31.3 births per
1,000 people) may be more reasonable and
suggest a crude birth rate in the low to
medium range for peasant populations.

category. Differences between subgroups
within each category are analyzed by
two-way analysis of variance tests. When

Among women aged 50 and older, there

in age, age at menarche, and the age at

Among women past menarche but not

with each fertility factor while the twoway analysis of variance test was performed, a test for covariate-by-factor interaction was run. This test determined
that no statistically significant linear relationships existed between age and the four
fertility variables. Consequently, the F ratios presented in Table 5 are computed by
a simple analysis of variance test. There

in age at menarche, age at first pregnancy,
number of live births, or number of surviving children among women in the different residence and socioeconomic categories.

EFFECTS OF NULLIPARITY
ON FERTILITY

The low fertility among all age groups

‘results, in part, from the existence of many

women whose pregnancy risk is relatively
low. While pregnancy risk could not be
ascertained directly, it is crudely reflected
in the number of women who are nulliparous and who have never completed the
series of rituals culminating in formal
marriage. Young never-married women
tend to live with their parents, and even
though sexual activity occurs, it is restricted by a number of social and economic factors. Never-married women past
the normal marriageable age are mostly
celibate Buddhist nuns.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of live
births according to the respondent’s age
and residence. The darkened area in each
case represents women who have never
been married. The first mean (X,) indicates the average number of live births for
all women, including never-married and
nulliparous women. The second mean (X2)
indicates the average number of live births
for women at risk, excluding never-married and nulliparous women. Differences
between the means are naturally greatest
among the youngest age groups because of
the large number of women under the culturally appropriate marriageable age. In
the two older age groups, differences are
greatest in the unacculturated villages,
which reflects the higher number of
never-married nulliparous nuns residing
there.

statistically significant residence or socioeconomic related differences exist in the
percentage of infant deaths. In the two
older age groups, the percentage of child
deaths reported by women from unacculturated villages is nearly twice as high as
that reported by women from acculturated
villages. Differences are statistically significant at the 0.05 level of probability.

Among women in the two older age

DISCUSSION

FERTILITY

The fertility of Sherpa women is somewhat low compared with peasant populations at low altitude (Henry, 1961;
Weiner, 1964) as well as with other highaltitude groups (Hoff and Abelson, 1976).
The average completed fertility among
women over 50 is fewer than five live
births, and the estimated crude birth rate
(31 to 33 per 1,000) is considerably below
that reported at high altitudes in South
America (between 46 and 56 per 1,000) by
Baker and Dutt (1972).

One contributory factor may be the late
onset of menarche. The average age at
menarche reported for the Sherpa, both

Nepalese Population

19]

here and by Pawson (1976), is considerably later than that of high-altitude Andean women (Cruz-Coke et al., 1966). Recall problems may exist, and the frequency
of women reporting fifteen and twenty
years as their age at menarche is quite
high. However, the existence of late
menarchial age is supported by responses
of younger women, who are more likely to
remember the occurrence of menarche accurately, as well as by the results of probit
and radiographic analyses carried out in
an independent sample (Pawson, 1976).

The cause of this extremely late
menarchial age is presently unclear. The
data presented here suggest that it is unaffected by the economic, nutritional, or
health care differences associated with residence or socioeconomic category. Since
these factors are associated with variable
menarche at low altitude (Petersen, 1975),
their lack of effect at high altitude may
suggest the action of a more universal
phenomenon. Noting that the menarchial
age of low altitude Tibetans is equally
late, Pawson (1976) posits a genetic basis.
Ibbertson et al. (1971) have demonstrated
that goiter and cretinism are endemic
among the Sherpas and that both are associated with hypothyroidism. These conditions are known to retard sexual maturation (Whipple, 1966) as well as physical
growth and development (Greene, 1973).
Hypoxia, too, may operate to retard
menarche (Frisancho and Baker, 1970;
Hoff, 1968) as part of its general effect on
the pattern of growth and development at
high altitude.

A two- or three-year retardation in the
average age at menarche may only partially explain the low fertility of Sherpa
women. Of greater importance may be the
social requirements placed on the families
of betrothed couples. Traditionally, these
requirements involved a series of gift exchanges and ceremonies that delayed marriage until the mid or late twenties.
Among the two older age groups, resurvey

192 Weitz
data revealed that the average age at first
marriage was 24.6 years, about eight years
after the average age at menarche reported
by these women.

While pregnancies can and do occur before marriage with little or no social
stigma, the majority seem to occur afterwards. Only a few of the nonmarried
women surveyed here (primarily those in
the youngest age group) reported having
been pregnant. However, resurvey data
revealed that the average age at first pregnancy (23.7 years) among women in the
two older age groups was earlier than their
average age at marriage (24.6 years). Consequently, prenuptial sex may have been a
factor increasing the fertility span somewhat. However, the majority of live births
still occurred after formal marriage.

Information from women in the oldest
category, those who have completed their
fertility, indicates that less than 10 per
cent of all live births occurred prior to age
25. On the other hand, almost 50 per cent
of all live births occurred when these
women were between the ages of 30 and
39 (Weitz, 1973). Since contraceptive
methods are not used (Lang and Lang,
1971), premarital sexual encounters may
not have been as frequent as others have
suggested, even among the two older age
groups. It is not unlikely that betrothed
couples were often separated when they
participated in their respective family’s
economic activities (herding, farming,
trading).

Since sexual access is not continuous
until after formalized marriage, it seems
reasonable to conclude that the apparent
retardation in the age of peak pregnancy
risk among older Sherpa females is a consequence of the late age at which formalized marriage occurred. The earlier
age at first pregnancy reported by younger
women, particularly those in Socioeconomic Category 2, probably reflects social
changes resulting directly from the eco
et al. Social Biology
nomic impact of mountaineering and
tourism. Sexual access is increased because the cash economy makes it easier to
afford or circumvent the traditional expenses and requirements of marriage and
neolocal residence. Many young couples,
for example, no longer own animals or
possess land. The cash they earn by trekking is used to purchase or rent a house, to
buy food at the weekly market, and to
acquire prestige at local ceremonies.

While the late age at marriage seems to
have delayed the onset of pregnancy
among older women, it alone does not explain low Sherpa fertility. Among groups
where the average age at marriage is not
too different from that of the Sherpa, and
where little or no sexual activity occurs
before marriage, the average completed
fertility is higher than that of the
Sherpa—between five and seven live
births (Eaton and Mayer, 1953; Friedl and
Ellis, 1976).

To an important extent, low Sherpa fertility seems to be a consequence of the
large number of never-married and nulliparous women in the Khumbu. This is
particularly true among women past
menarche and under age 30. Over 50 per
cent of all women in this category who
were born in the six main villages reported
being both never-married and nulliparous.
It is less the case among older women in
these villages, only 6.6 per cent of whom
reported being both never-married and
nulliparous. The frequency of nulliparous
women residing in the two monasteries
seemed particularly high, regardless of
age. Most of these women are nuns and
claim to be celibate. Unfortunately, it was
impossible to substantiate these claims, or
to assess how their life style affects their
pregnancy risk.

Part of the explanation for low Sherpa
fertility may also lie in intragroup cultural
differences associated with residence and
socioeconomic categories. Among the two

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

Vol. 25, No. 3

oldest age groups, women in Socioeconomic Category 2 report an average of one
to two fewer live births than do women in
Socioeconomic Category 1, even though
their average ages at first pregnancy are
similar. Only in the youngest group is
there an absence of intragroup fertility differences.

The low fertility of older women in Socioeconomic Category 2 could be related to
underreporting. Many of the women in
this group are Tibetans who, for social
reasons, may have incorrectly related the
number of live births. However, comparable figures were obtained by both surveys, which was not the case for antenatal
mortality data, where inaccurate reporting
was clearly a factor. In addition, the number of living children, independently
enumerated by the two surveys, was also
low. Finally, data on infant and child
mortality corresponded with information
provided on live births and living children. For these reasons, it was concluded
that underreporting was not a major factor associated with the low fertility of migrant women.

Intragroup differences may also be related to varying patterns of sexual access.
Migrant men, for example, are more likely
to be engaged in long-distance trade than
are nonmigrant men, thereby possibly affecting the parity of women in Socioeconomic Category 2. For the most part,
however, separation periods are probably
not too different between the two socioeconomic categories. Migrant men who
engage in the cash economy by portering
or trekking may work with their wives,
just as do nonmigrant men. If couples do
not work together, separations are just as
long among migrants as among nonmigrants. Many migrant men serve as artisans
and only rarely leave their wives.

An alternative explanation may be the
low socioeconomic status of migrants and
its effect on the nutrition and health care

Nepalese Population

193

of pregnant women. Tibetan migrants, in
particular, are reluctant to seek Western
medical assistance. Among those migrants
who do not participate in the cash economy, access to food and goods in the local
market is limited. At low altitude, inadequate nutrition and poor health are known
to retard intrauterine growth and development (Newman, 1975) and may reduce
fertility by increasing antenatal mortality
(Frisch, 1975, 1977). Similar conditions
may occur at high altitude as well.
Residence pattern appears to affect the
number of live births only among women
aged 30 to 49. The reasons may be assoclated with the cash economy that began
to develop about ten years before this
study took place. At that time, most
women in the oldest age group would have
ended their childbearing years. Any effect
of acculturation on the fertility of this
group, therefore, would have been minimal. All the youngest women began their
fertile periods following the introduction
of the cash economy. The absence of
village-related fertility differences in this
group is probably associated with an increasing participation in the cash economy, regardless of residence pattern.
However, most women aged 30 to 49 were
entering their most fertile period when the
cash economy was first introduced. The
degree to which members of this age group
participated in the cash economy depended upon residence pattern. Residents
of the three acculturated villages filled
most of the early trekking jobs, while
those living in the three unacculturated
villages continued to work in the traditional manner. Even today, fewer residents of the unacculturated villages engage in the cash economy. Of those that
do, most are under age 30. Since participation in the cash economy bears directly on
access to nutritional supplements available in the market and to health care,
particularly drugs, fertility of women in

unacculturated villages could have been
affected in a manner similar to that described for migrants.

MORTALITY

The relatively high percentage of infant
deaths (15.8 per cent of all live births) is
comparable to that reported at high altitude in Peru (Baker and Dutt, 1972) and
is apparently unaffected by differences in
the age of the mother, residence pattern,
or socioeconomic category. Nutritional
and health care differences, comparable
to those related to patterns of residence
and socioeconomic category among the
Sherpa, are known to influence the infant
mortality of low altitude populations
(Petersen, 1975). Their apparent lack of
influence on infant deaths in the Khumbu
may suggest the action of some other factor, perhaps hypoxia.

High infant mortality is characteristic of
high altitude groups (Alers, 1965; CruzCoke et al., 1966; Hoff, 1968; Mazess,
1965; Spector, 1971). However, as Baker
and Dutt (1972) point out, comparably
high infant mortality rates also exist
among many low altitude peasant populations. Like other peasant groups, inadequate diet and poor health care were and
to some extent probably still are common
among the Sherpa. Continuous Westernstyle medical services were initiated only
five years before our study took place.
While the impact of Western medicine has
been appreciable, particularly in the acculturated villages, various childhood
exanthemas as well as tuberculosis and
pneumonia are still common (Lang and
Lang, 1971; McKinnon, 1968), and goiter
is endemic. These diseases are pervasive,
occurring in all villages and in both socioeconomic categories. Consequently, their
effect on infant mortality may be equal to
or even greater than that of hypoxia.

Among the two older groups, reported
child deaths (between ages 1 and 12) are

Weitz et al.

 

Social Biology

considerably higher in unacculturated villages, with no apparent effect attributable
to differences in socioeconomic category.
Village differences in access to nutritional
supplements available in the local market
and poor health care again suggest themselves as possible explanations.

CONCLUSIONS

Like other highland Nepalese groups
(Goldstein, 1976), the population structure
of the Sherpa and Tibetan inhabitants of
the Khumbu seems affected more by culture than by features of the physical environment. The low fertility of the population is due, in part, to the interaction between social factors that delay the age at
marriage and those that promote nulliparity. Both function to maintain a large pool

age, voluntary celibacy (as Buddhist nuns)
is common enough to significantly reduce
the reproductive capacity of the population. Furthermore, socioeconomic and residence factors may affect access to nutrition and/or medical care. Both are related
to intragroup fertility differences, and socioeconomic category is also related to differences in child mortality.

Only menarche and infant mortality
seem unaffected by socioeconomic and/or
residence category. Retarded menarchial
age and high infant mortality are also reported among high altitude Andean populations and therefore may be influenced by
hypoxia. However, it is equally likely that
they could be affected by endemic goiter
and cretinism, by hypothyroidism, or by
the general level of nutrition and health
care. .

It is possible that the effect of hypoxia
may be too subtle to detect with data presented here and perhaps may elude demographic techniques altogether. The
primary influence of hypoxia probably oc

curs before birth, a period for which demographic information is rarely complete.
Studies directed toward understanding intrauterine development at high altitude
may therefore offer the best opportunity
for assessing the possible influence of
hypoxia on fertility. Postnatal events at
high altitude in Nepal seem more directly
related to cultural factors.
