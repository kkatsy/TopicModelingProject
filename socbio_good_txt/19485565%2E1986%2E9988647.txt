Nutrition as Determinants of Infant Mortality in

Less-developed Countries

ABSTRACT: Using data for sixty less-developed countries, we constructed a causal model in
which medical care, nutrition, status of women, and socioeconomic development are examined
as determinants of infant mortality. Social and economic development are treated as exogenous
variables; medical care, nutrition, and status of women are viewed as variables endogenous to
the model. The model is tested by maximum likelihood methods. Results indicate that good
nutrition and the presence of informally trained health care personnel, i.e., midwives, are more
significantly related to low rates of infant mortality than are the employment status of women
and the presence of formally trained health care personnel such as physicians and nurses. The
general level of social and economic development conditions these relationships.

An understanding of the determinants of infant mortality is of critical importance to underdeveloped countries.
Quite apart from the need to reduce the
human suffering implied by high infant
mortality, such an understanding may
act to reduce fertility, since it is widely
accepted that a fall in infant mortality
will lead ultimately to lower fertility
(Preston, 1978; Flegg, 1982). However,
according to Simmons and coworkers
(1982), the inverse phenomenon should
also be taken into account, i.e., mortality may also be affected by prior fertility
and by the family size desires of parents.

For many years students of genera}
mortality have believed that mortality
decline in the Industrial Revolution was
related to improvements in nutrition
and other aspects of social and economic
development. McKeown, Brown, and
Record (1962, 1965) demonstrated that
the decline in mortality in England and

301

Wales during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was due largely to a rising standard of living, not to medical advances. According to Thomlinson
(1965), medica] improvements, especially the development of antisepsis and
asepsis, were responsible for a further
mortality decline, but this decline occurred in the late nineteenth century.
Demographers such as Preston (1975)
now believe that mortality has become
increasingly disassociated from economic level. This is due to increased
availability of medical and health technologies, facilities, and personnel to
previously disadvantaged segments of
societies.

Demographers and public health
personnel have not always agreed with
each other as to the determinants of
mortality in less-developed countries
(LDC). Davis (1956) credited the rapid
decline of mortality in non-Western so

cieties to public health measures, such
as malaria control, which did not require
societies to undergo a thorough tratisformation of socioeconomic structure.
Ceylon, the case cited by him, was later
examined by Frederiksen (1960) who
minimized the contribution of the malaria control campaign in the reduction
of mortality. Frederiksen claimed that
economic development, by increasing
per capita food consumption, was an important cause of the mortality decline in
Ceylon. Stolnitz (1955) in an analysis of
international mortality trends argued
that increase in life expectancy may almost always be explained by two broad
categories of causes: first, rising levels of
living (income, nutrition, housing, and
literacy); second, technological advances (public health, medical science,
sanitation). He further emphasized that
the introduction of new disease-control
techniques in Latin America, Africa,
and Asia had led to drastic mortality declines in the few years prior to his analySIS,

In a more recent international analysis of mortality, Rodgers (1979) notes
that studies of the determinants of mortality change in LDC’s have had two important difficulties. First, improvements
in health technology and its availability
are relevant but their effects are difficult
to identify and segregate from each
other and from important factors such as
sanitation, clean water supply, education, and a host of environmental variables. Many aspects of development and
health tend to be collinear, which makes
it difficult to isolate the effect of a particular variable. Second, there is a tendency for health programs to be most intensive in the least healthy places, which
further confuses observed relationships.

Often we find a positive correlation be

tween the presence of health programs
and high mortality.

Studies of the determinants of infant
mortality rates (IMR) in LDC’s are inadequate in two other ways as well:
They have not included a sufficient
number of explanatory variables, and
the statistical analyses could be improved. In this study, we have attempted to identify the important determinants of IMR in LDC’s through
maximum likelihood methods. These
techniques permit greater understanding of the causal connections among the
exogenous and endogenous variables
and allow a certain amount of measurement error to remain in the model.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

Research in different parts of the
world has shown the influence of economic development, level of literacy, female labor force participation, health
services, and nutrition on infant mortal
ity.

Economic DEVELOPMENT

The negative relationship between
infant mortality and the level of economic development has been used as a
barometer for economic development
(United Nations, 1982). This relationship has been observed in developed
countries such as the United States,
Canada, and Sweden. As the GNP increases, the standard of living improves,
which leads to an improvement in nutrition and health services (Berg, 1973;
Gaise, 1975).

A similar observation has been made
in developing countries (Krishnan,
1975; Rodgers, 1979). However, PresDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

ton (1975) notes that one should not expect to find a direct relationship between mortality and per capita income,
because per capita income is an average
measure and does not take the distribution of income into account. The effects
of income on mortality are likely to be
greater at the lower end of the income
distribution.

Income is also likely to influence the
level of mortality indirectly, through its
effects on the rate of consumption of
items affecting health, such as food,
housing, sanitation, medical care, and
education. In his international summary
on structure and change in causes of
death, Preston (1974) observes that certain diseases (e.g., diarrheal diseases,
which are influenced strongly by nutntion and personal sanitation) are
thought to be dependent largely upon
the standard of living and hence not
readily amenable to reduction through
specific medical and public health measures.

LITERACY

Level of literacy is another index
which seems to be associated with the
level of infant mortality. This is especially true among women in the reproductive ages. Because the mother is the
agent through whom societal institutions must act to safeguard the health
and the life of the child in the home, her
attitudes and abilities are of great importance. The literate mother is more
likely to have at least the minimum educational requirements to enable her to
take advantage of the scientific child
care which the community has to offer.
The effect of literacy on IMR tends to be
negative and indirect and operates
through standard of living, nutrition,

Infant Mortality 303

medical and health services, and possibly other variables as well (Chang and
Pendleton, 1978; Chang et al., 1979).

Caldwell (1979), on the basis of a rigorous analysis of Nigerian survey data,
concludes that maternal education is the
single most important determinant of
mortality in childhood. Caldwell suggests three main reasons for this conclusion. First, educated mothers may be expected to break with tradition, to
become less “‘fatalistic’’ about illness
and to adopt many of the modern alternatives in child care and therapeutics.
Second, an educated mother is more
able than an illiterate one to command
the attention of doctors and nurses. Her
knowledge of available medical facilities
is likely to be superior; she tends to regard their use as a right, not as a boon.
Third, the education of women greatly
changes the traditional balance of family
relationships with profound effects on
child care.

Flegg’s (1982) study of the determinants of IMR in LDC’s lends support to
Caldwell’s conclusion. In this study female illiteracy is used as the measure of
education. Krishnan (1975) observed in
India that literacy plays two roles. As a
preventive measure, literacy helps to reduce mortality by promoting social hygiene. As a measure of control, literacy
generates awareness, which helps the
literate mother make the best use of
medical facilities. However, not all studies agree with the value of female literacy in the reduction of infant mortality.
Frenzen and Hogan (1982), after studying infant mortality in rural Thailand,
indicate that maternal education does
not increase the ability of the mother to
provide adequate infant care, at least to
the degree necessary to reduce infant
mortality significantly.

FEMALE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION

In countries where the status of
women is low, increased female labor
force participation has considerable influence on infant mortality. Moreover,
female labor force participation in the
nonagricultural sector has greater influence over the IMR than participation
in the agricultural sector (United Nations, 1982). Women in the nonagricultural sector have very little time to devote to the bearing and rearing of
children. Women in nonagricultural employment also have greater exposure to
available medical and health facilities
and tend to take better care of their
fewer children. Therefore, we expect female labor force participation to have a
negative influence on the IMR.

HEALTH CARE

The IMR has frequently been used as
an indicator to assess the success of public health programs both in developed
and in developing nations (United Nations, 1982). In developing countries
there is a special need for public health
programs designed to provide some
measure of health care to the many people living in poverty. Studies by Flegg
(1982) and Yang and Pendleton (1980)
have found that health facilities play an
important role in lowering the level of
infant mortality in LDC’s.

NUTRITION

— It is well known that balanced nutrition is a necessary condition for human
health and survival. Poor nutrition increases the individual’s susceptibility to
disease. A wide disparity in food supply
has been observed between developed
and developing countries. There are
also major differences in nutrition
within developing countries.

Jayachandran and Jarvis

Social Biology

Although there are exceptions to the
rule, people in developed countries suffer more often from excessive intake of
rich food, while persons in developing
countries are more likely to suffer from
inadequate nutrition. Children and
pregnant or lactating women are particularly vulnerable to the dangers of inadequate food supply. World Health
Organization studies indicate that
weight gain during pregnancy is lower in
poorly nourished population groups.
Low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams)
is highly associated with an increased
risk of infant death (WHO, 1974). Diet
and nutrition have been found to play an
intervening role between education and
mortality (c.f., Friedlander and Silver,
1967; Bengoa, 1974). Although most
studies find a negative association between good nutrition and mortality, one
study (Yang and Pendleton, 1980) observed that good nutrition was related to
a higher crude death rate among the
LDC’s. Such an unusual finding requires further investigation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This section describes the variables,
the sources of data, and the method of
analysis used in the study.

VARIABLES

Based on the preceding review of the
literature, the following concepts were
selected for use in the analysis. Under
each concept certain indicators were selected, again on the basis of their prior
successful use in other studies.

5. Nutrition (NUTRI
a. per capita calorie consumption as

Prior studies have not used number
of midwives as a health care indicator.
However, in recent years the hope has
grown that properly trained paraprofessionals, such as midwives, can bring
enough maternal and child care information to villages that an effect on the
infant mortality rate may be realized.
This hope-has led to a proliferation of
programs to train such personnel for use
in the remote areas of LDC’s (Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific, 1976).

_ The proportion of women who are illiterate has been used as a negative measure of education (Flegg, 1982).

Countries such as Hong Kong and
Singapore were excluded from the analysis due to the fact that their IMR’s were
below those of many of the developed
countries. The analysis was carried out
for sixty countries for which comparable
data were available. —

METHOD OF ANALYSIS

In order to test the direct and indirect
relationships among the variables, we
proposed the theoretical model in Figure 1. We analyzed the model by maximum likelihood methods developed by
Jéreskog (1981, Lisrel, Version V), because of several advantages over the
usual path analysis techniques. Besides
computational convenience, LISREL
avoids potential problems with biased
estimates by adjusting for measurement
error (Entwisle and Hayduk, 1981). It
also furnishes modification indices and
partial derivatives that provide some
clues to the validity of the model structure. LISREL allows for exploration of
reciprocal effects, if any, in the model.

Fic. 1—Proposed model for showing the determinants of IMR.

Above all, LISREL allows the use of
multiple indicators for the estimation of
theoretical variables.

RESULTS

In a preliminary analysis the interrelationships among seven independent
variables and the IMR were examined
through zero-order correlation (Table
1). All the variables were correlated
significantly in the expected direction.
However, the rather low correlation between the presence of midwives, and
availability of physicians (0.221), and
nurses (0.195), was not expected. Similarly, the high correlation of economic
development with midwives (0.618), as
opposed to that with physicians (0.518),
and nurses (0.414), was unexpected.

The variables were examined by exploratory data analysis (stem and leaf,
and schematic plots) (Tukey, 1970). The

 

analysis indicated skewness and outliers
among all the variables. As a result the
variables were transformed by using
natural logarithms. This has the effect of
normalizing the distributions of the variables. After the transformations, the
correlations of midwives with physicians
(0.455) and nurses (0.422) increased
considerably. The magnitude of the correlations of economic development with
health variables such as physicians
(0.804), nurses (0.570) and midwives
(0.370), were also changed in the direction originally expected.

Figure 2 shows the actual maximum
likelihood estimates derived for the proposed model and indicates that the
causal linkages among the variables are
in the expected direction. However, the
initial fit of the model was poor. The
goodness of fit index was 0.66
(X? = 49,36, df = 17, p = 0.000). The

rivatives obtained for the model suggested that we free the covariances
among the measurement errors of
health indicators. When the measurement errors were allowed to correlate,
they were found to be negatively related, which indicates that the errors involved in measuring the health indicators were not in the same direction in
various countries. The above modification improved the model considerably.
The chi-square dropped from 49.36 to
22.74 for the loss of 3 degrees of freedom (GFI = 0.76, p = 0.065). The influence of the health care variable on
IMR increased significantly (—0.016 to
—0.107). The influence of the other variables remained more or less the same.
The negative correlations of measurement errors among health indicators led us to treat them as separate concepts rather than combining them as
indicators of one concept (health). Figure 2 shows the final model with three

separate health concepts and correlated
disturbance terms (PSI). The chi-square
of 0.79 with 6 degrees of freedom
(p = 0.992) indicates what is so far the
best fit of the model we have proposed.
The goodness of fit index is 0.954 and
the coefficient of determination is 97 per
cent. r

Prior to our acceptance of the above
model, we decided to construct three
submodels in which health indicators
were added one by one to the system.
This allowed us to measure the separate
influences of each health indicator on infant mortality.

In the first submodel, the number of
physicians to population was used to
measure the health concept. The best fit
of this model is X2 = 0.70, df = 4.00,
p = 0.951, GFI = 0.944. While all
other variables had their expected influence on infant mortality, the health
variable (physicians) had almost no influence (0.003) (Figure 3).

In the second submodel, health is
represented by the number of nurses per
population. The best fit of this submodel
is X* = 0.00, df = 4.00, p = 1.000,
GFI = 1.000. The health variable
(nurses) was once again not statistically
significant on the IMR. Although the
status of women had no direct effect, it
had an indirect negative influence on the
IMR. In this submodel the impact of economic development on health (nurses)
is much less pronounced than on health
in the physicians’ submodel (0.100 to
0.311) (Figure 4).

The third submodel uses the number
of midwives to population as an indicator of health care (X? = 0.02,
df = 4.00, p = 1.000, GFI = 0.994).
When midwives are used as a health
care proxy, the influence of health care
on IMR increases to —0.264 and becomes statistically significant. The inclu

sion of midwives also produces slight but
nonsignificant changes in other relationships in the model (Figure 5).

In sum, the analysis of submodels indicates that the traditional way to consider these health indicators, i.e., that
they all measure the same concept
(health), no longer seems to be appropriate. This is especially true when the
unit of analysis is “countries.” Therefore, the following discussion will be
based on the model (Figure 2) in which
the health indicators were treated separately, allowing only for their structural
disturbances to be correlated. Since the
LISREL Program ts based on full information maximum likelihood procedures, the estimates obtained are net of
the effect of other variables in the sysfem.

sented in Table 2.' In this model socioeconomic development has both direct
and indirect influence on the IMR
through status of women, nutrition, and
health. The status of women, which is
also an indicator of general development in a society, does not influence the
IMR directly but has a significant indirect effect through health variables. No
causal connections among the health
variables are included, except the correJations through their structural disturbance terms.

EXOGENOUS VARIABLES

The effects of the two exogenous variables, social and economic development, on endogenous variables are

quite different in magnitude despite
their moderately high correlation with
each other (—0.611). As shown in Table
2, social development, measured by female illiteracy (a negative measure),
does not have a significant direct effect
on nutrition (—0.002) and health variables such as physicians (0.021), nurses
(—0.093) and midwives (—0.017). On
the other hand, it has a greater indirect
influence on health variables through
status of women. The reverse is true for
the IMR in that the direct effect of social
development (0.368) is greater than the
indirect effects (0.024) which are negligible. In other words, social development tends to influence nutrition and
health largely through its indirect impact on the status of women prevailing
in that country. The standardized coefficients given in Table 2 also support this
finding and indicate that social development has a strong direct effect on the
IMR (0.514) and status of women

nurses (0.601), physicians (0.521), midwives (0.418) and on general nutrition
(0.275). Status of women has a very
weak direct influence on the IMR
(—0.038), but a strong indirect influence
(—0.506 metric coefficient). On the
other hand, nutrition (—0.158) and midwives (—0.419) have significant negative
effects on the IMR, whereas the relationships of physicians and nurses to infant mortality are not significant.
Though the number of nurses by itself
has a slight negative influence on the
IMR (-—0.143), in the presence of other
health variables its influence disappears
and actually changes sign (0.096). The
number of midwives, on the other hand,
shows significant negative effects both in
the presence (—0.303) and in the absence (—0.365) of other health variables. The analysis of submodels given in
Table 3 also supports this finding (see
also Table 4).

DISCUSSION

One possible explanation for this
result could be that voluntary and international development agencies tend to
allocate their staff to the least healthy
places (Rodgers, 1979). Their staff tend
to be composed of those with formal
medical credentials, such as doctors and
nurses. Hence, discussions of the availability of health personnel tend to focus
on the number of physicians and nurses.
By contrast, the role played by staff at
the grass roots level, i.e., community
health volunteers, “barefoot doctors,”
multipurpose workers, and auxiliary
nurse midwives is seldom taken into account.

It has been assumed that the availability of all kinds of health personnel
has the same effect on the IMR. This
may not be true, especially in parts of

 

Social Biology

the world where the overall standard of
health care is poor. Where the level of
literacy is low and where awareness and
accessibility to health facilities are also
low, special efforts are required to facilitate health care delivery to poorer segments of the population. Otherwise, the
existence of such facilities may not produce the desired health impact. Workers at the grass roots level can be of special benefit in effecting the delivery of
such public health services.

Midwives are an example of grass
roots workers and in some societies are
involved in the community to a great extent. They are sometimes better able to
provide preventive and promotive
health care services than are formal
health care personnel. Essential prenatal and postnatal care are often delivered by midwives. Nurses, by comparison, often do tasks only under the
direction of a doctor and have little authority of their own. They could perform many tasks without a doctor’s supervision but frequently are not allowed
to do so. If they were, it would improve
the functioning of the health care system
where it is least efficient (Perry, 1978).
A recent survey on primary health care
in India (Jayachandran et al., 1980) concluded that: family planning received
exaggerated emphasis to the virtual exclusion of other aspects of primary care;
medical officers were mainly interested
in clinical work as opposed to preven- .
tion; the conditions under which multipurpose workers and auxiliary nurse
midwives worked were not satisfactory;
and medical supplies were often not
available. This is just one example of
what in many countries may constitute
misplaced emphasis on priorities and
personnel which have political weight
and not enough support to the more informal aspects of health care.

In the field of family planning, studies
conducted in different parts of the world
have shown that nonphysicians are generally as competent as doctors in the insertion of IUD’s (Eren et al., 1983).
Eren and associates further assert that
adequately trained auxiliary nursemidwives can provide a standard of chinical care for IUD users which is comparable to that provided by physicians.
Nurse-midwives may provide a more effective service than physicians because
they are more accessible and acceptable
to clients.

Therefore, it would seem to us that
the urgent need in LDC’s may not be for
more highly-trained physicians but
rather for workers at the grass roots
level who are closer to the community.
Such a need is most critical in countries
where the level of literacy is low, where
nutrition is poor, and where there are
large sectors of the population for whom
poverty and illiteracy restrict access to
health facilities. To increase the number

of physicians and nurses may not play as
vital a role in the reduction of the IMR
in LDC’s as the use of training funds to
produce more midwives and other
workers at the village level.

CONCLUSION

Our findings strongly suggest that socioeconomic development plays a significant role in the reduction of infant
mortality in less-developed countries.
They also suggest that such development should be coupled with improvements in health personnel and nutrition.
The need for workers at the grass roots
level in the overall health care delivery
system should be recognized. Health
care delivery should shift from hospitalbased care, oriented to the treatment of
disease, “Basic health care,” to “Primary health care,” which emphasizes
prevention through improvements in
education, nutrition, water supply, and
sanitation.
