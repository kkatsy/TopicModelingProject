ABSTRACT: This study examines the intermediate determinants of fertility in Sri Lanka by
making use of the data collected in the 1982 Sri Lanka Contraceptive Prevalence Survey and the
1987 Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Survey. The analysis shows that the most important
inhibitor of potential fertility is deliberate control. The marital structure of the population is also
an important fertility-inhibitor, but lactational infecundability is increasingly becoming an
unimportant contributor. The findings show the success of the family planning program in Sri
Lanka, which propelled fertility to a substantial lower level. Achievement of the replacement
level fertility by the turn of the century, set by the Sri Lankan government, would largely depend
on the efforts to increase the quality and quantity of contraceptive use and the duration of

breastfeeding.

Even though Sri Lanka is among
the least developed of the Third World
countries, it is characterized by a continued high level of socioeconomic development, high literacy, low mortality, increasing status for women, and is
becoming a nonagrarian economy. Related to the socioeconomic and cultural
changes taking place, the country is experiencing rapid fertility decline. Many
couples in Sri Lanka intend to have
very small families and have rapidly
adopted fertility regulation (De Silva,
1991).

The dramatic change in fertility in
Sri Lanka during the past three decades' has been well documented
(Department of Census and Statistics,
1988; Ministry of Health, 1992). The
total fertility rate (TFR) fell from 5.3
children per woman in 1953 to 2.6 children per woman in 1985-87..Throughout the 1960’s and 1970’s TFR decline
was moderate, but during 1980's it

gathered momentum. The TFR of 1981
was as high as 3.4 children but declined
by 24 per cent, or almost one child, by
the period 1985-87. The rapidity that
has characterized the decline in fertility
makes Sri Lanka an unusually interesting case for examining the determinants of fertility among developing
countries (Gajanayake and Caldwell,
1989; De Silva, 1990a).

There have been numerous studies
on fertility in Sri Lanka, but still little
is known about the precise nature of
the determinants of the recent fertility
change. Studies of the determinants of
fertility levels and their changes often
seek to measure the impact of socioeconomic factors on fertility. Substantial insights can be gained if, in addition to the socioeconomic factors influencing fertility, the specific mechanisms through which these factors
operate are identified (Gajanayake,
1983). For example, the level of edu

cation of women is a socioeconomic indicator that is frequently found to be
negatively related to fertility. A more
detailed analysis may show that among
educated women marriage is relatively
late or the use of contraception more
frequent, thus clarifying the relationship between education and fertility
(Freedman, 1987). In general, the biological and behavioral factors through
which socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental variables affect fertility
are called intermediate fertility variables (Hobcraft, 1987). To examine
the trends in these intermediate variables, Bongaarts’s intermediate determinants model has been applied on the
data obtained in two large surveys in
Sri Lanka to quantify the fertilityinhibiting effects of the important determinants of fertility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for analysis are drawn
from the 1987 Sri Lanka Demographic
and Health Survey (SLDHS) and the
1982 Sri Lanka Contraceptive Prevalence Survey (SLCPS). The sample of
the 1987 SLDHS is a multi-stage stratified probability sample representative
of the entire country excluding Northern and Eastern provinces. The two
provinces contain approximately 14
per cent of the 1986 estimated population of Sri Lanka. During the enumeration, 8,119 households and 6,170
eligible women were identified and interviews were completed among 5,865
ever-married women of aged 15-49
with a response rate of 95.1 per cent.
The questionnaire in SLDHS has two
distinct parts: household questionnaire
and individual questionnaire. The
household questionnaire listed all

243

usual residents and any visitors who
slept in the household the night before
the interview together with some basic
information such as age and marital
status. The household questionnaire
was used to identify women who were
eligible for the individual interview.
The individual questionnaire devoted
attention to obtaining information not
only on fertility and family planning
but also marriage, fertility preferences,
husband background information, and
health status of children (Department
of Census and Statistics, 1988).

The 1982 Sri Lanka Contraceptive
Prevalence Survey (SLCPS) was the
last survey to cover the whole country.
Because of the civil war in the Northern and Eastern provinces these areas
were not included in any subsequent
fertility or family planning surveys.
However, for comparison purpose
with 1987 SLDHS, data pertaining to
Northern and Eastern provinces of the
1982 SLCPS has been excluded in subsequent analysis, in order to make
these two surveys comparable with the
geographic areas covered. The basis of
the SLCPS was multi-stage probability
sampling. It also had two main sections: household questionnaire and
individual questionnaire. A total of
6,315 households were listed and 5,753
were completed. Among females listed
in the household questionnaire there
were 4,666 eligible respondents. Of
these, 96 per cent or 4,500 evermarried women of ages 15-49 were
successfully interviewed using individual questionnaires (Department of
Census and Statistics, 1983).

Davis and Blake (1956) proposed
eleven intermediate fertility variables
as determinants of observed level of
fertility of any population. For simple

244

quantification, however, Bongaarts
(1978 and 1983) reduced those variables into eight factors. He demonstrated that variation in only four of
them, namely the proportion married,
contraception, induced abortion, and
postpartum infecundability are of any
substantial importance in the analysis
of fertility determinants or trends. In
this multiplicative model of Bongaarts
on intermediate fertility, he expressed
the actual level of fertility (TFR) as the
outcome of the fertility-reducing effects of these four main intermediate
determinants on a total fecundity rate
(TF), which represents the fertility
level in the absence of any reduction by
the four determinants:

TFR = Cm X Cc X Ca X Ci X TF

where Cm is the index of proportion
married, Cc the index of contraception, Ca the index of induced abortion,
Ci the index of postpartum infecundability.

In the model, the impact of these
four intermediate variables are measured; the effects attributed to each determinant are measured independent
of the effect of other measured or unmeasured factors. When an intermediate variable has no fertility-inhibiting
effect, the corresponding index equals
unity. If the fertility inhibition is complete, the index equals zero. Thus, the
complement of the index value gives
the estimated percentage reduction in
fertility due to that intermediate determinant. The usefulness of the model,
however, does not depend on the availability of absolutely precise estimates
of the required measures. As long as
reasonable estimates are available, the
model is quite useful in assessing the
extent to which the four intermediate

 

De Silva

determinants inhibit fertility and how
their contributions change over time.

RESULTS

Since variations in fertility can be
attributed to the differential impact
of marriage, contraception, induced
abortion, and postpartum infecundability and induced abortion, a brief
overview of these factors are presented
along with the corresponding estimates
of indices.

MARRIAGE CHANGE

The delay in marriage and its impact
on fertility have led Kirk (1969) to refer to Sri Lanka as “‘the Ireland of
Asia.’ Although Sri Lanka is located
in South Asia which is noted for its universal and early marriage for females,
in Sri Lanka marriage is now very late
and may no longer be universal. As observed in the 1987 SLDHS, 6 per cent
and 4 per cent of females in ages 40-44
and 45-49 were never married, and
the general trend shows a little upward
movement of permanent celibacy
(Table 1).

The trend of a steady increase in
the proportion never-married among
young women has been observed in Sri
Lanka for a very long time. Thus, as
illustrated in Table 1, the proportion of
never-married women in the age group
15-19 increased from the already high
figure of 75 per cent in 1946 to 93 per
cent in 1987. The next age group saw a
sharper increase in the proportion of
never-married which rose from 29 per
cent to 57 per cent over the same period.

(SMAM) is used to examine intensity
of first marriage in Sri Lanka. The
SMAM is the mean age at first marriage among those who ever marry. In
other words SMAM as calculated here
is the average number of years spent in
the single state by those who marry before age 50.

The SMAM of females in 1901 was
as early as 18.3 years, a level higher
than that found by the World Fertility
Survey in contemporary Bangladesh
or Nepal and only little below that
recorded for Indonesia or Pakistan
(Smith, 1980). Therefore, Caldwell
and others (1989) identified Sri Lanka
as the leader in Third World Asia’s
change in marriage patterns; by the
mid 1970’s Sri Lankan females were
marrying not at puberty but a decade
later.

The SMAM of females increased by
almost 4 years over the last 30 years,
but there was little increase for men.
Thus, the sex differentials have
dropped from over 6 years in 1946 to
3.5 years in 1981. The SMAM of males

in Sri Lanka from 1963 remains almost
constant at 28 years, while females recorded a slight increase, from 23.5 to
24.4 in the period 1971-81. As found in
1987 SLDHS, the SMAM of females
has increased further to the level of
24.8 years from the 24.7 of the 1982
SLCPS. The principal explanations put
forward for the rise in the female age at
marriage in Sri Lanka are a marriage
squeeze and an economic squeeze
(Fernando, 1985; Caldwell et al.,
1989).

The marriage pattern in Sri Lanka
usually shows differences of about 5
years in the ages of brides and grooms.
Most women marry between the ages
15-29; and most men, between the
ages 20-34. Therefore, the availability
of men and women at these marriageable ages influences the formation of
unions. Censuses from 1901 to 1953 do
not indicate any sex imbalance at these
popular marriageable ages. However,
since 1963 the situation has changed.
There is a shortage of males in marriageable ages, indicating a serious

246

marriage squeeze caused by the age
difference between spouses in a
population-growth situation where
each age group is larger than the next
oldest.

For the past several decades, the
economic situation of the country has
put marriage in an economic squeeze.
Economic hardship is directly linked to
finding money for a dowry and housing, and the increasing unemployment
and civil war have all tightened the
squeeze. Throughout the country, the
unemployment level among young educated males is high, and most of the
survey respondents from many surveys
have emphasized the impossibility of
marrying daughters to unemployed
men (Caldwell et al., 1989; De Silva,
1990b).

The demographic impact of the
marriage changes has certainly been
considerable. Fernando (1975) has ascribed almost all of Sri Lanka’s fertility
decline between 1963 and 1969 to
changes in the female age at marriage,
while Alam and Cleland (1981) have
attributed 59 per cent of the fertility
decline between 1963 and 1971 and 46
per cent of the decline between 1971
and 1975 to marriage changes. Although the nuptiality pattern has
changed greatly during the past several
decades, in Sri Lanka procreation is almost entirely within marriage, so that
any upward or downward trend in nuptiality would therefore influence the
fertility of Sri Lankan women.

ToTAL FERTILITY, MARITAL FERTILITY
AND INDEX OF CM

Until around the mid 1950’s, fertility in Sri Lanka remained at a relatively
high level. The crude birth rate showed

De Silva

 

Social Biology

a decline between 1953 and 1963 which
is mainly attributed to changes in the
age structure of the female population.
Over the past three decades, there has
been a substantial decline in the TFR
in Sri Lanka, from 5.0 in 1963 to 3.7 in
1981-82 and to 2.6 in 1985-87. The average annual decline in TFR was only
1.4 per cent during 1963 and 1981-82,
but the decline was over 6 per cent during 1981-82 and 1985-87.

Current fertility of the 1987 SLDHS
has been estimated by averaging the
reported births of the three years (36
months) prior to the survey date, while
in 1982 SLCPS current fertility was estimated by taking births occurring over
the 12-month period prior to the survey data. The age-specific marital fertility rates were derived by dividing the
age-specific fertility rates by the proportions of women who were currently
married in each age group, with minor
adjustments for possible distortion in
the proportion married in the 15-19
years age group. As shown in Table 2,
in the 1982 and 1987 surveys only 7
per cent of currently married women
represent the ages 15-19. Therefore,
age-specific marital fertility rates
(ASMER) for that age group are much
higher than for other age groups. Bongaarts and Potter (1983) suggest that
the value of the ASMFR for the age
group 15-19 be estimated at 0.75 times
of the ASMER of age group 20-24.

Age-specific fertility rates (ASFR’s), as presented in Table 2, show a
broad flat-top distribution. In both surveys age-specific fertility is highest
among women aged 25-29; thereafter,
it declines. During the period 1985-87,
except in the ages 45-49, fertility in all
ages has declined considerably. The
decline was more strong among women

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

aged 30 and over. A comparison of
ASFR’s of two surveys shows that most
of the fertility decline in Sri Lanka, as
exemplified by age-specific current
fertility rates, is mainly the product of
a decrease in marital fertility among
older women, with the exception of
those above 45 (Table 2).

Once the couples reach the number
of children they do not wish to exceed,
efforts are made to stop childbearing,
thereby reducing marital fertility rates
disproportionately at older ages and
lowering the average age of the mother
at last birth. Thus, as noted by Knodel
(1979, 1987), trends in marital fertility
to older women should be more sensitive to changes in the extent of family
limitation practices than trends in
overall fertility trends. From the data
presented in Table 2, the total marital
fertility rate after age 30 and above
(7M30+ ) is obtained for the two periods; summing the age-specific marital
fertility rates experienced by women
aged 30 and above and then multiplying by 5 since the age-specific rates
were calculated for five-year age
intervals. As expected the decline in
TM30+ is much higher (31 per cent)
than the decline in the total marital fertility rate (18 per cent) for the same period.

Index of marriage, Cm, 1s a fertility
weighted index of proportions married, calculated by taking the weighted
average of the proportions married in
the different age groups with the greatest weights being given to age groups
with high fertility rates. The TFR of
2.62 and total marital fertility (7M)
of 5.24 of the 1987 SLDHS resulted in
a Cm value of 0.501, while Cm value
of the 1982 SLCPS resulted in 0.578
(Table 2).

CONTRACEPTION AND INDEX OF CC

In 1965, by a cabinet decision, family planning was introduced as a national policy and became active only in
1968 when the Family Health Bureau
was established to co-ordinate and direct the activities of the national program, within the Ministry of Health.
However, the acceptance of modern
contraception in the country is a relatively recent development. In the 1976
Sri Lanka World Fertility Survey
(SLWFS), current users among currently married women of ages 15-49
were estimated at 34 per cent, 41 per
cent of whom were relying on traditional methods and 31 per cent on sterilization (Table 3). Between the 1975
SLWFS and the 1982 SLCPS, the reported prevalence of contraception increased from 34 per cent to 58 per cent,
but reported use of traditional methods
increased more rapidly than the use of
modern methods.

The overall contraceptive prevalence of 58 per cent in 1982 SLCPS
had increased to 62 per cent by 1987
SLDHS. Current use of all modern
temporary methods has remained virtually constant at around 10 per cent in
all three surveys. Traditional method
use increased initially from 14 per cent
to 26 per cent between 1975 and 1982
respectively, but has subsequently declined to 21 per cent in 1987. Among
the current users in 1987 almost onehalf (48 per cent) were users of sterilization while less than one in five (17
per cent) used any modern temporary
methods (Table 3). After sterilization,
in all three surveys, the most widely
used method is periodic abstinence
(rhythm or safe period). Among the
traditional methods the safe period

shows an increasing trend and definitely lays claim to being a future research priority so as to ascertain exactly how Sri Lankan couples employ it
and what success in preventing pregnancy they may expect from it.

The fertility transition is taking
place while the Sri Lankan population
is largely rural and agricultural, and
there seems to be a general receptivity
among broad segments of the population, including those with little or modest education and living in rural areas,
to the changes in reproductive patterns
that are now taking place. Those broad
segments of Sri Lanka’s population appeared to have considerable latent demand for family planning even before
Sri Lanka began to undergo major social changes. Sarkar (1957) noted that
fertility trends in the 1930’s suggested
fertility control, but discounted the
possibility because he knew of no considerable sale of contraceptives. The
explanation was undoubtedly the use
of rhythm and withdrawal, information
about which was accessible in the literature as family planning manuals in
the indigenous languages of both the
major communities were in circulation
at that time.

Among populations today, contraceptive use is the intermediate fertility
variable assumed to be primarily responsible for the wide range in the
level of fertility within marriage. The
index of contraceptive use (Cc) is equal
to 1 in the absence of contraception
and to 0 if all fecund women use 100
per cent effective contraception. The
index of Cc is estimated from the contraceptive prevalence and effectiveness
levels among married women using the
equation:

Reproductive Change

249

Cc = 1-— 1.08 X ue
where u = contraceptive prevalence
among married women of
reproductive age,
e = average contraceptive use
effectiveness, and 1.08 is a
sterility adjustment factor.

Method effectiveness has been
adopted from the results of the Sri
Lanka Rural Family Planning Survey
of 1986 (Thapa and Hamill, 1991). Program methods had the highest effectiveness while non-program methods
had the lowest; sterilization had the
use effectiveness of 0.99 but safe period (rhythm) had the lowest effectiveness (0.62) of any method (Table 3).
The results of the calculation of the average use-effectiveness (e) and the index of contraception (Cc) are presented in the lower panel of Table 3; it
yields a Cc of 0.426 for the 1987
SLDHS and Cc of 0.476 for the 1982
SLCPS.

ABORTION AND INDEX OF CA

Although induced abortion is recognized as an increasing problem in many
parts of the world, little is known about
its actual level, especially in countries
where there is legal restriction. The index of induced abortion (Ca) equals 1
in the absence of induced abortion and
O if all pregnancies are aborted. Due to
lack of information on induced abortion in the 1982 SLCPS, and in 1987
SLDHS or in any other national study,
the index of abortion is omitted from
this application. Even though no reliable national estimate could be obtained on abortions in Sri Lanka, because of its illegality, many researchers
tend to believe in the emergence of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

250

abortion as a fertility control method
(Langford, 1982; Caldwell et al., 1987;
De Silva, 1991; Perera and Rajapaksa,
1991).

POSTPARTUM INFECUNDABILITY
AND INDEX OF CI

After childbirth a woman experiences temporary infecundability, that
is, a period when ovulation does not
occur. This is called postpartum amenorrhea. In the absence of breastfeeding, the length of postpartum amenorrhea is usually one or two months after
a childbirth. But this period can be
extended by intensive and prolonged
breastfeeding. The length of postpartum infecundability is found to have
a substantial effect on the level of fertility.

The effect of breastfeeding on postpartum amenorrhea differs from one
population to another, which may be
due to differences in intensity and frequency of breastfeeding. In developing
societies, the length of breastfeeding
can be longer than one year. The mean
duration of breastfeeding in Sri Lanka
was 22.7 months in the 1987 SLDHS.
Breastfeeding continues for a relatively long period in Sri Lanka and
fully 81 per cent of children born 10-11
months ago are still breastfed. The
mean duration of postpartum amenorrhea is computed from the mean duration of breastfeeding reported in the
1987 SLDHS; it is obtained by dividing
the prevalence of condition (breastfeeding) by the incidence of the condition (Singh et al., 1985). Prevalence is
defined as the number of children
whose mothers are amenorrheic at the
time of the survey. Incidence is defined
as the average number of births per
month. This average is estimated by

De Silva

 

Social Biology

summing the number of births over the
last 37 months to overcome problems
of seasonality.

The index of postpartum infecundability (Ci) equals 1 in the absence of
breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence, and 0 if the duration of infecundability is infinite. The Ci is computed by a straightforward formula,
[Ci = 20/(18.5 + i)], where i is the
mean duration of postpartum amenorrhea.

The index of Ci for Sri Lanka for the
1987 SLDHS is 0.769. However, for
the 1982 SLCPS there is no required
information to compute Ci. Therefore,
taking the estimated value of Ci
(0.612) in the 1975 SLWFS (Casterline
et al., 1984), along with the 1987
SLDHS estimate, Ci value for the year
1982 is estimated by using linear interpolation. It resulted in a Ci value of
0.704 for the year 1982. There is evidence from South Asian countries that
the duration of postpartum amenorrhea is showing a declining trend (Salway et al., 1992; Ford and Kim, 1987;
Knodel et al., 1987; Singh and Ferry,
1985). Presumably the increasing use
of contraception may be one of the important contributing factors to the declining trend in postpartum amenorrhea in Sri Lanka.

MULTIPLICATIVE EFFECTS OF
INTERMEDIATE VARIABLES

Empirical observation indicates that
although the total marital fertility rate
(TM) and total natural fertility rate
(TN) differ widely among populations,
total fecundity rate (TF) is rather stable between 13 and 17 births per
woman, with the standard value being
15.3 (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983). It
should be noted that, if in a population
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

all women married early and if breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence,
contraception, and induced abortion
are not practiced, then the total fecundity rate (TF) is the expected number
of children the women will bear during
their reproductive period. In the
present study the value of 7F is taken
as 15.3 births per woman.

Table 4 presents the estimated values of the indices of the principal intermediate determinants of fertility.
The complement of each index represents the proportionate reduction in
fertility attributed to each determinant
of fertility; the smaller the index value,
the greater is the fertility-inhibiting effect of the variable. TFR, as a measure
of the actual level of fertility, is an outcome of the variation in the proximate
determinants. Of the indices in the
model, marriage index of Cm represents the proportion by which 7FR is
smaller than TMFR (TM) as a result of
a non-marriage. Likewise, the index of
Cc provides the proportion by which
TM is smaller than TN through the use
of contraception, and the index Ci
shows by how much TN is smaller than
TF due to the effect of postpartum infecundability.

Indices shown in Table 4 indicate
that in 1982 the marriage pattern reduces the actual fertility level below
marital fertility by 42 per cent
(Cm=0.578). Contraception has the
highest effect on marital fertility, attributing a reduction of 52 per cent
(Cc = 0.476). Lactational infecundability has the lowest fertility-inhibiting effect, reducing the total fecundity rate
(TF) by only 30 per cent (Ci=0.704).
By 1987, contraceptive prevalence and
marriage pattern show an increasing
contribution to the decline in fertility,

Reproductive Change

251

but the contribution of lactational infecundability to the fertility decline
shows the opposite.

During this five-year period (1982
and 1987) a considerable amount of
change has occurred in marriage patterns, and contraceptive use; Cm and
Cc have declined by 13 per cent and 11
per cent, respectively. Thus, the decline in TFR from 3.7 in 1982 to 2.6 in
1987 was caused primarily by the
change in marriage patterns and increasing use of contraception. The
combined fertility-inhibiting effect of
all three intermediate determinants
(Cm, Cc and Ci) was 0.194 in 1982 and
0.164 in 1987 indicating a decline of
just over 15 per cent in fertility during
the period 1982 and 1987.

The relative importance of the
fertility-inhibiting effects of each index
at two survey points is examined more
precisely in Table 5. In this approach,
the difference between the total fecundity rate (JF), which is taken as
15.3, and the estimated TFR is attributed to the result of the inhibitory effect produced by the proportion of
the logarithm of each index to the sum
of the logarithm of all indices (Wang
et al., 1987). For example, the fertility- .
inhibiting effect of the marriage variable is obtained as:

[7F — TFR (estimated)] <x logCm/
(logCm + logCc + logCi)

The fertility-inhibiting effects of the
other two variables (Cc and Ci) are obtained similarly. For both the years estimated, TFR is obtained by multiplying the total fecundity rate with the
combined effect of all three indices
(TF x Cm X Cc X Ci). In 1982 a total
of 12.3 births were inhibited: 4.1 births
(33 per cent) were due to the effect of

the marriage variable; 5.6 births (45
per cent) were due to contraception;
2.6 births (21 per cent) were due to lactational infecundability. In 1987 a total
of 12.8 births were inhibited, and the
highest reduction, 6 births (47 per
cent), was inhibited due to contraception while the lowest, 1.9 children (15
per cent), was inhibited due to lactational infecundability. Clearly the
fertility-reducing effect of lactational
infecundability has been reduced over
the study period.

PHASE OF THE FERTILITY TRANSITION

What are the prospects of future decline of fertility and it’s components in
Sri Lanka? This question is examined

by placing the current fertility level and
the fertility-inhibiting indices of Sri
Lanka in a world context. Bongaarts
and Potter (1983) classified population
into four transition phases according
to different fertility levels: (I) TFR
over 6.0, mainly in the developing
countries; (II) TFR lying between 4.5
and 6.0; (III) TFR between 3.0 and
4.5; and (IV) TFR less than 3.0, mainly
in the developed countries. Most populations in Phase I have a fertility level
close to that of natural fertility, while
populations in Phase IV have completed most or all the fertility transition.

As Caldwell (1994) noted—in his
study on the course and causes of fertility decline—of the South Asian

countries Sri Lanka is not far above replacement, as is the case with Thailand
in Southeast Asia (Hirschman et al.,
1994). When Sri Lankan fertility is
compared with those four transition
phases in Table 6, it is clear that the
TFR of Sri Lanka is very close to that
of developed~ countries—2.62 compared to 2.06. Sri Lanka Is certainly at
the latter phase of the fertility transition. The Sri Lankan fertility transition
bears greater similarity to that of Europe than to any other part of South
Asia. As noted by Caldwell and others
(1987), the early introduction of mass
education and concurrent changes in
the economy and unemployment made
large families a disadvantage to many
sections of the society.
Fertility-inhibiting indices of the
Bongaarts’s model of Sri Lanka also
reveal a remarkable similarity with
the indices of developed countries. The
greatest impact of TFR through contraception is observed in Sri Lanka as
well as in developed countries. Level

of contraceptive prevalence of 62 per
cent in Sri Lanka is fairly closer to the
corresponding estimate of 69 per cent
prevalence from the developed countries. Even though it seems likely that
Sri Lanka will soon follow the changes
in many developed countries where
modern contraception has increasingly
displaced the natural methods, one
should not underestimate just how
deep-seated is the feeling against much
modern contraception.

Of the fertility-inhibiting indices,
the index of Cm is found to be lower in
Sri Lanka than in developed countries.
The index of Ci is also much lower
in Sri Lanka than in the developed
countries, since the postpartum nonsusceptible period observed in Sri
Lanka is longer at 7.5 months compared with a much shorter (about 3
months) period observed in developed
countries. The prevailing cultural and
social norm in Sri Lanka is unlikely to
permit a greater change in the proportion of non-married beyond a certain

limit and prospects for an immediate
rise in age at marriage of females over
25 years does not seem to be very
bright. On the other hand, the fertilityreducing effect of lactational infecundability is gradually decreasing.

In Sri Lanka, as found in the 1987
survey, there is high motivation to control fertility among married couples. In
fact, the survey has shown that the desired total fertility rate of 2.2 children
during 1985-87, compared with the observed total fertility rate of 2.6, meaning that if couples had only the children
they desired, the total fertility rate
would have been 2.2 children instead
of 2.6 children (Westoff et al., 1989).
Thus, in Sri Lanka a considerable
amount of unwanted fertility still takes
place. Therefore, further reduction in
fertility can be largely expected from
the increasing use of contraception
combined with higher use-effectiveness.

CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATION

This study attempted to estimate the
fertility-inhibiting effect of the three
most important intermediate determinants, namely marriage, contraception, and lactational infecundability.
Data on induced abortion are not
available, and its effect remains unmeasurable. Observed fertility of Sri
Lanka had declined to a fairly low level
of 2.6 births per woman by 1985-87.
The finding of this study gives evidence
of the success of the major role played
by the family planning program and
the government population policy. Average annual growth of population of
Sri Lanka is now at just 1 per cent,
which is much lower than all the South
Asian countries.

De Silva

 

Social Biology

Estimated indices of the Bongaarts’s model indicated that the most
important inhibitor of potential fertility is deliberate control, with contraception being able to reduce potential
fertility by almost one-half, while
non-marriage (Cm) is able to reduce
fertility by one-quarter. The fertilityinhibiting effect of lactational infecundability is relatively unimportant in
Sri Lanka, but certainly is more influential than that found in the developed
countries. The analysis suggests that
the fertility-reducing effect of contraception is steadily increasing, but the
effect of lactational infecundability
shows the opposite. The fertilityreducing effect of the marriage variable is also increased over the period
1982 and 1987.

Sri Lanka has long been known as a
poor country whose significant fertility
decline resulted from the combination
of a well-organized, noncoercive family planning program with low mortality and high female status (Caldwell,
1987; Freedman, 1995). From the policy point of view, for the first time, the
Sri Lankan government set the target
of achieving a TFR of 2.1 equal to replacement level by the year 2000 in its
population policy statement issued in
1991 (Ministry of Health, 1992). However, additional effort will be required
from family planning during this decade to reach this target as the number
of women entering reproductive ages
will be much larger than the number
that entered during the previous decades. More than 200,000 new acceptors of family planning will need to be
recruited annually to reach the contraceptive prevalence rate of 72 per cent
by the end of the decade to achieve the
replacement fertility.

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

The achievement of replacement
level fertility, primarily through a
higher level of contraceptive prevalence, could be attained by a number of
policy-related actions. First, the family
planning program should be encouraged to improve both availability and
accessibility of contraceptive services
in all under-served areas. Secondly,
efforts to.increase the quality of contraceptive use to achieve higher useeffectiveness is of immense importance
because it could lead to a greater contribution to fertility decline. Third,
since our index of contraception (Cc) is
considerably higher than the estimate
of the developed countries (0.426 vs.
0.301), there is a clear possibility of
achieving higher prevalence by providing a method mix that meets the varied
needs of couples. Finally, adequate financial resources for commodities,
information, education, and communication (IEC) programs should be provided to gain higher prevalence and
thereby a favorable demographic trend
by the end of this decade.

Sri Lanka has moved from a situation of very young age at marriage toa

Reproductive Change

 

255

situation where age at marriage is
among the latest in Asia, late even by
the standards of many developed countries (De Silva, 1990b). Therefore, the
fertility-inhibiting effect of the marriage variable may increase in the future, but at a very slow rate. It seems to
be that the fertility-inhibiting effect of
marriage in Sri Lanka is largely being
compensated for by a decrease in lactational infecundability. Breastfeeding
is universally practiced, if not for long
duration, in most parts of the country.
However, during the last two decades a
moderate decline in the mean duration
of breastfeeding has taken place, presumably due to an increasing proportion of women participating in the
work force and also due to propaganda
made by the powder milk producers.
The decline in the duration of breastfeeding has operated against the prevailing trends toward lower marital fertility. Therefore, lactation as a way of
improving child health and reducing infant mortality may be promoted to full
and intensive levels to lower fertility in
Sri Lanka. |
