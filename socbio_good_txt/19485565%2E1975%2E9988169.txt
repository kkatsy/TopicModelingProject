A Genetic Study of Spina Bifida Cystica

in Utah

Charles M. Woolf

Department of Zoology

Numerous studies have been carried out
during the past decade to determine if spina
bifida cystica has a genetic component
(Williamson, 1965; Carter et al., 1968;
Richards et al., 1972; Carter and Evans,
1973). The results of these studies indicate
the complexity of the situation. Although
the frequency of the malformation is increased in the sibs of propositi as compared
with newborn frequency values in the general population, a genetic interpretation is
obscured by exogenous factors of etiologic
importance that may be present in the home
environment. It is also generally agreed that
genetic and nongenetic factors causing spina
bifida cystica also lead to anencephaly.
Both malformations are increased in frequency in the sibs of propositi with either
disorder,

Based on their own studies and data
found in the literature, Carter and Evans
(1973) suggest that both of these malformations of the central nervous system are
influenced by a genetic predisposition depending on variation at several loci and
additional environmental factors. Carter
and Evans (1973) obtained heritability
estimates of 0.60, 0.65, and 0.70, for South
Wales, Glasgow, and London populations,

 

respectively, where spina bifida cystica and
anencephaly occur at a relatively high frequency. Renwick (1972) presents the intriguing hypothesis that an unidentified
substance in certain potato tubers is a major
teratogenic agent.

In 1960, I initiated studies in the state of
Utah to determine the etiological importance of genetic factors for various congenital malformations. The results of several of
these studies have been published (Woolf,
Woolf, and Broadbent, 1963a, 19635, 1964,
1965; Woolf, 1963, 1971a, 19716; Woolf,
Koehn, and Coleman, 1968; Woolf and
Woolf, 1970, 1973). Spina bifida cystica
and anencephaly have a relatively low incidence in Utah (Woolf and Turner, 1969).
Assuming a polygenic mode of inheritance,
the frequency of a congenital malformation
in the sibs of propositi with the disorder
should be a reflection of the incidence in
the general population (Edwards, 1969;
Falconer, 1965). The frequency in the sibs
of propositi from a low incidence population
(such as Utah) should be lower than the
frequency in sibs of propositi from a high
incidence population (such as Great Britain). Such a phenomenon is not expected
for single gene inheritance.

The objective of the present study in
Utah was to determine the incidence of
spina bifida cystica in the sibs of propositi
with this congenital malformation. The
purpose was to gain further evidence for or
against a polygenic mode of inheritance
and to obtain an empiric risk value that
would be useful for genetic counseling in
Utah.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Because spina bifida cystica is relatively
infrequent in Utah and the total population
of Utah is only about a million, it was not
feasible to obtain a large number of propositi for this study. A total of 107 cases (45
males, 62 females) of spina bifida cystica
were obtained from hospital records in Salt
Lake City, Utah. From the names of these
propositi and their parents, current addresses were obtained from telephone books,
city directories, or church records. The
homes were visited by field workers who
attempted to obtain information of epidemiologic interest. Special attention was
given to the occurrence of an anomaly of
the central nervous system in the sibs of
these propositi. An attempt was made to
verify these anomalies in the sibs by utilizing hospital records,

Since etiological factors leading to a defect of the central nervous system often
lead to fetal wastage, an attempt was also
made to obtain information on stillbirths
and miscarriages resulting from the pregnancies of the mothers of the propositi.
Control data were obtained from obstetrical
records in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Phoenix, Arizona. The objective was to determine if mothers who have produced a child
with spina bifida cystica show an increased
propensity for stillbirths and miscarriages.
Control females were matched with the
mothers of the propositi on the basis of
total number of live births. For example,
if the mother of a propositus had six live

births (including the propositus), the first
female encountered in the obstetrical records with six live births was used as the
control,

RESULTS
SPINA BIFIDA CYSTICA IN SIBS

Experience demonstrated that medical
records and stillbirth records in the state of
Utah do not yield reliable data on specific
anomalies present in stillbirths. Information was not available to determine the frequency of anencephaly in the relatives of
the propositi. For this reason, the data presented in this study only concern spina
bifida cystica in live births.

The propositi had a total of 317 liveborn
sibs. Of this number, 151 were born subsequent to the propositi. Three (0.95 per
cent) of the 317 sibs were born with spina
bifida cystica. Two of these affected sibs
were born subsequent to the propositi, giving a frequency of 2 in 151, or 1.32 per cent.
The overall frequency of 0.95 per cent
would not be appropriate for genetic counseling, since there is a tendency for some
parents to terminate the sibship after the
birth of a child with spina bifida cystica.
Any such tendency results in empirical risk
values that are biased downward; for example, if all sibships were terminated after
the birth of an affected child (propositus),
the empirical] risk value would be zero. For
this important reason, the frequency of
spina bifida cystica in sibs born subsequent
to the propositi is the proper risk value for
genetic counseling.

Woolf and Turner (1969) presented data
on the incidence of major malformations
among live births in Utah based on nursery
records available in the Latter-day Saints
Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. During
the 1951-61 period, there were 59,561 live
births in this hospital. Twenty were born
with spina bifida cystica. An additional 10
had multiple malformations including spina

bifida cystica, giving a total frequency of
30 in 59,561, or 0.05 per cent.

Using the population incidence and the
risk in sibs, Falconer (1965) developed a
method for determining the heritability of
anomalies showing polygenic inheritance.
Genetic and nongenetic variation exists between affected and nonaffected individuals.
In the absence of nonadditive genetic variance, heritability is defined as the proportion of the total variance due to genetic
differences between affected individuals.
Using a population incidence of 0.05 per
cent and a sib frequency of 1.32 per cent
gives a heritability value of 0.60. It is of
interest that a similar heritability value was
obtained for South Wales where the incidence of spina bifida cystica is relatively
high (Carter and Evans, 1973).

FETAL LOSS AMONG SIBS

The mothers of the propositi had a total
of 500 pregnancies. Thirteen (2.6 per cent)
ended in stillbirths and 66 (13.2 per cent)
in miscarriages, giving a total fetal loss of
15.8 per cent. The control females from
Salt Lake City had a total of 504 pregnancies. Of this number, 16.5 per cent resulted
in either a stillbirth (1.0 per cent) or a miscarriage (15.5 per cent). The percentage
values for the control females from Phoenix
were 1.0 per cent stillbirths and 13.1 per
cent miscarriages, giving a total fetal loss of
14.1 per cent. Since the total percentage
values (15.8, 16.5, and 14.1) are quite similar, these results are compatible with the
hypothesis that females who have produced
a child with spina bifida cystica do not show
an increased tendency for pregnancies to
terminate in a loss of the fetus. This conclusion is not unexpected because of the
results of other studies (Williamson, 1965)
and the relatively small number of mothers
included in the study. It is of interest, however, that the mothers of the propositi had

Social Biology

2.6 per cent stillbirths, as compared with
1.0 per cent in control females from Salt
Lake City and Phoenix. Because of the inadequacy of the records, it could not be
determined if the increase in stillbirth in
the mothers of the propositi was due to
anomalies of the central nervous system.

DISCUSSION

In Great Britain, the risk of spina bifida
cystica in sibs born subsequent to propositi
with this disorder is over 5 per cent (Carter
and Evans, 1973). Even though only 107
families were included in this study in
Utah, and therefore the reliability of the
estimates may be questioned, the frequency
of sibs wth spina bifida cystica is of the
order of magnitude expected if the genetic
predisposition has a polygenic mode of inheritance, For example, using the average
of the heritability values calculated for
Great Britain, i.e., 0.65, by Carter and
Evans (1973) and the population of 0.05
per cent obtained for Utah (Woolf and
Turner, 1969), the expected frequency of
spina bifida among the sibs is 1.64 per cent.
This expected value is remarkably similar
to the observed value of 1.32 per cent
among sibs born subsequent to the propositi. If the actual frequency of affected sibs
had been over 5 per cent, which is observed
in the sibs of propositi in Great Britain,
the polygenic model would be negated because of the low incidence in the Utah
population, unless the heritability was
much higher in the Utah population.

The population of Utah is predominantly
Caucasian. Mormon pioneers began arriving in 1847, The area soon became a âgenetic melting pot.â Between 1847 and the
coming of the railroad in 1869, 80,000
members of the Mormon Church from the
United States and Europe immigrated to
the area. From 1850 to 1900, over 30,000
converts came to Utah from the Scandina

vian countries (Mulder, 1955), and from
1850 to 1929, over 52,000 emigrated from
Great Britain (Evans, 1937). Converts arrived in smaller numbers from Germany,
Holland, Austria, France, Switzerland, and
elsewhere. In 1880, twenty-five different
nationalities were represented (Mulder,
1956).

Although Mormon communities were established in many locations in the intermountain West and many of these relatively isolated communities were colonized
by groups of families, the rate of inbreeding
never went as high as might have been
expected. A study of the frequency of consahguineous marriages among the Mormon
people and their relatives living in Utah
revealed that inbreeding has been minimal
when compared with populations in other
parts of the world (Woolf et al., 1956). The
Mormon people in Utah, especially those
residing in cities, are highly outbred, a situation resulting from the continual flow of
immigrants to Utah and the social pressure,
especially in recent years, against the marriage of closely related individuals. The composite and outbred nature of the population
dictates that congenital anomalies resulting
from rare autosomal recessive genes and
polygenes should be relatively infrequent.

Hewitt (1965) noted that the geographical variation in the incidence of spina bifida
cystica in the United States during the
period 1950-55 is both large and credible,
with the lowest values occurring in the
Western part of the United States. He proposed that this geographical variation is
due to greater outbreeding in the western
part of the United States. Renwick (1972)
proposes that this geographical variation is
correlated with the severity of the lateblight (Phytophthora infestans) attack on
potatoes. Potatoes grown in the western
part of the United States, such as in Idaho
and Utah, tend not to have blight because

the low atmospheric humidity does not promote the sporulation and spread of the
fungus. The true reason for the geographic
variation in the incidence of spina bifida
cystica is unknown. An exogenous agent
may be the principal cause; however, if so,
it is of interest that it leads to frequency
data mimicking polygenic inheritance. It is
likely that exogenous agents and a polygenic predisposition interact to give spina
bifida cystica. The importance of a genetic
predisposition is shown by racial differences; spina bifida and anencephaly occur
at a low incidence in Negroes living in various different geographical regions (Carter
and Evans, 1973).

SUMMARY

A genetic study of spina bifida cystica
was carried out in Utah using 107 propositi
with this congenital malformation. The frequency of sibs with this disorder born subsequent to the propositi was 1.32 per cent.
This relatively low frequency is compatible
with the hypothesis of polygenic inheritance
because of the low incidence of this disorder in the general population. The heritability estimate based on the risk in subsequent sibs and the population incidence is
0.60, which corresponds to values obtained
in Great Britain where this malformation
of the central nervous system occurs at a
relatively high frequency. A genetic predisposition and unknown environmental] factors probably interact to give spina bifida
cystica.

Total fetal loss due to miscarriage and
stillbirths was not increased in frequency
in the pregnancies of the mothers of the
propositi when compared with control females from Salt Lake City, Utah and Phoenix, Arizona. However, the stillbirth frequency was increased in the pregnancies of
the mothers of the propositi when compared
with the control females. It is not known if

this increase is attributable to malformations of the central nervous system.
