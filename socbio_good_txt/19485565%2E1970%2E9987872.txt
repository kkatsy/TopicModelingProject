The Terena are the descendents of one of
the subgroups of the Arawak-speaking
Guana. In pre-Colombian times they moved
southward into the northern Chaco from the
Amazon Basin. They remained there until
the second half of the elghteenth century
when they crossed the Paraguay River in
successive waves and established themselves
in the Brazilian region bathed by the Miranda River in the southern part of the state of
Mato Grosso. Their present location is still
this general region, between latitude 20°-22°
south and Jongitude 54°-58° west.

From a demographic point of view they
are remarkable among Brazilian Indians,
since in contrast to other tribes which experienced a marked decline the Terena are
increasing in number. The migrating groups
of the eighteenth century were estimated as
comprising about 3,000 persons; the present
Terena population numbers about 5,000 individuals distributed over some twelve villages (Cardoso de Oliveira, 1960). The
present report analyzes some demographic
data of genetic interest collected by one of
us in the village of Cachoeirinha, as part of a
broader study dealing with the process of
Terena sociocultural assimilation into the
Brazilian society (Cardoso de Oliveira, 1957,
1958, 1959, 1960, 1965/66, 1968).

Due to more than 150 years of contact

with Neo-Brazilians they have acquired
habits and customs of the latter, but still
maintain to a varying degree many features
of their traditional culture in the several
local groups they form. The population of
Cachoeirinha was chosen for this detailed
study after a survey was made of all the
villages. The survey indicated that this community was one of the most conservative,
but still suffered processes of change that
could be profitably investigated.

The analysis to be reported below is a
further contribution to a long-term project
aiming at the characterization of the population structure of South American Indians
living in different stages of culture change.
The questions being asked are: (1) To what
extent do groups of hunters and gatherers
differ in basic demographic parameters from
populations of agriculturalists? (2) In what
way do these differences affect their genetic variability?!

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The main population center of Cachoeirinha is located some eight kilometers
from the railroad station of Duque de Estra

da and 18 kilometers from the small city of
Miranda in southern Mato Grosso, Brazil.
The village, with 53 houses, was built inside
an Indian reservation of 2,260 hectares,
measured and delimited in 1905. Two other
nearby groups of houses are identified by
the names of Argola and Capao and many
other families live scattered in different
places. However, the Indian population of
the reservation can be considered as a unit.
Terena Indians have lived in this place since
the end of the eighteenth century. The first
census of Cachoeirinha was taken by the
Indian Protective Service in 1919 and revealed 228 persons. Subsequently other cen

these values with those summarized in De
Oliveira and Salzano (1969) and Salzano,
Moreno, Palatnik and Gershowitz (1970),
we see that of six other South American Indian populations only one (the Juruna)
showed a higher percentage of individuals in
that age interval. As far as the sex ratio is
concerned, the Terena and all groups summarized in the two above-mentioned studies
show a value higher than 100. This can be
expected in populations with predominantly
young individuals. However, the differences
in sex ratio in the three age groups shown
in Table 1 are difficult to explain. As expected, the mortality data showed an excess

suses were performed with the following results: 1926, pop. 436; 1927, pop. 503; 1937,
pop. 750; 1941, pop. 750; 1954, pop. 834.

Field work among these Indians was performed by Dr. Cardoso de Oliveira in 1955,
1957, 1958, and 1960 totaling about one
year of actual time spent in the field. Most
of the results to be reported here were obtained from a census made in 1957, but mortality data includes information gathered in
1957 and 1960.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows data about age and sex distribution. The mean age of the Terena is
low, with a high percentage (45%) of individuals in the 0-14 age category, Comparing

of deaths among men (109/205 or 53%).
A total of 88.6% of the individuals were
identified as putatively “pure” Indians (Table 2). While the great majority are Terena,
there are also a few Layana, Kinikinao, and
products of crosses between these tribes.
Information about inter-racial marriages
and endogamy is given in Tables 3 and 4.
The observed frequencies of Indian X
Mestizo and Indian X Neo-Brazilian unions
agree well with those to be expected in a population with a racial composition as given in
Table 2. On the other hand, the Indian population of Cachoeirinha is the most exogamic
of all tribes tested so far. Since 46% of the
marriages involved people born outside the
community, Cachoeirinha can be regarded

as an open population, the mating unit being
much larger than its actual size. This is confirmed by the large number of localities reported as birthplaces by the spouses. Not
less than 30 different names were registered;
sixteen of them were from nearby fazendas (ranches), and the majority of the
other places are located Jess than 100 km.
away from Cachoeirinha. It is interesting to
mention that there seems to be a tendency
for increased endogamy in this group. As
can be seen in Table 4, the incidence of such

 

Brazilian Terena Indians 219

marriages is higher among persons in the
age interval 15 to 35 than in older spouses.
The difference between the two distributions
is statistically highly significant (X? = 15.2;
2 d.f.; P < 0.001).

Table 5 shows data about the fertility of
the Terena woman. The numbers shown
there are slight overestimates because, due
to the manner in which these data were collected (without information about years of
cohabitation), we could not identify sterile
couples. However, since sterility is low

among these groups, we trust that the figures are not too far from the true values.
The mean number of live births per married
individual over the age of 15 is very high
(4.8) compared with the following figures
from other South American tribes: Bororo,
3.0; Xavante, 3.1; Juruna, 3.2; Maca, 3.4;
and Caingang, 4.5. The Terena figure for the
mean number of live-born offspring in completed sibships (Table 6) is also high (5.5).
Of four other South American tribes, only

 

Social Biology

one (the Caingang, with 6.1) presents a
higher value.

As shown in Table 7, the average number
of offspring surviving at the time of the
census per female who had at least one
liveborn child is 3.8. This corresponds to a
decrease of only 21% in relation to the
average number of live births, a moderate
mortality rate if we consider that values
as high as 58% were reported among the
Kuikuro (Ribeiro, 1956). The average num

ber of surviving offspring in completed
families (4.2) is the highest so far recorded
in South American Indians (previous results: Xavante, 3.1; Maca, 2.4; and Yanomama, 2.2) (see Table 8).

The breeding size of the Terena population (number of actual progenitors) is 362
(Table 9), that is, 39% of the total popula~
tion, and its effective size (Li, 1955) can be
estimated as 222 (24% of the total). The

Brazilian Terena Indians

221

population cannot be considered the breeding unit. Due to these peculiarities, they
show a very low index of total selection in
. tensity, the relative contributions of mortality and fertility to the index being practically equal.

One of the questions posed in the introduction can now be considered. What is the
extent of the differences in basic demograph-~ic parameters between hunters and gatherers

relative proportions of these three parameters are of the same order of magnitude as
the ones observed among other South
American tribes. The index of selection intensity (Crow, 1958) obtained for the Terena (0.63) is very low (about half of that
calculated for the Caingang and lower than
the ones obtained for other tribes (see Salzano, 1963; Neel and Chagnon, 1968;
Salzano et al., 1970),

DISCUSSION

The main features of Terena demography
can therefore be described as follows: It is
a relatively young, increasing population.
The first census performed there occurred in
1919. In the 38 years which elapsed from
that date until our census was made, the
population quadrupled. Part of this increase
was due to immigration, but the high fertility and low mortality no doubt also contributed to this high rate of increase. The
sex ratio is relatively high, and the Terena
present some intermixture with non-Indian
persons. Exogamy is high and the local

other? Data are slowly accumulating in
South America for groups at these two
stages of cultural development. For hunters
and gatherers (with incipient agriculture)
we have information about the Xingu Indians (Ranke, 1898), Kuikuro (Ribeiro,
1956), Xavante (Salzano, Neel and Maybury-Lewis, 1967), Yanomama (Neel and
Chagnon, 1968) and Juruna (De Oliveira
and Salzano, 1969). For agriculturalists,
fishermen, and tribes already somewhat ad

vanced in the process of acculturation, data
are available for the Bororo (Baldus, 1937),
Caingang (Salzano, 1961, 1963, 1964),
French Guiana Indians (Hurault, 1966; Sutter, 1966), Cashinahua (Johnston et al.,
1969), Makiritare (Ward and Neel, ms.),
Maca (Salzano et al., 1970) and Terena
(present communication).

Some simple statistics regarding age and
sex distribution only are also given for many
other groups by Ribeiro (1956), Fuchs
(1967), and Nutels (1968). The list looks
impressive, but due to differences in the
methods of data collection and analysis
many of these populations cannot be compared with the others in relation to specific
characteristics. A detailed consideration by
tribe is out of place here. But even a superficial examination of the results indicates
that it is still too soon for safe quantitative
statements, although some generalizations
can be made (further discussion in Neel and
Salzano, 1967; De Oliveira and Salzano,
1969).

It is sometimes implied without much
discussion that the intensity of natural selection has been decreasing in recent times
as compared to conditions of the past. The
application of Crow’s (1958) index to tribal,
state, and national populations showed that
this may not be necessarily true, and that at
least the opportunity for selection sometimes exists as much in hunting and gathering as in agricultural or industrialized socleties. This is not to say that selective pressures remained unchanged during the whole
process of our cultural development. Some

Social Biology

agents have no doubt significantly changed
during this period. The challenge ahead is
the quantitation of these changes, There is a
need also to relate population structure differences with the group’s genetic variability.
Work is now in progress on an attempt to
obtain an answer to this question.

SUMMARY

The Arawak-speaking Terena of Cachoeirinha, southern Mato Grosso, Brazil
are a relatively young, increasing population, 45% of its individuals falling into the
age category 0-14. Their sex ratio is relatively high, and they present some intermixture with non-Indian persons. Exogamy
is high, and the local population cannot be
considered the breeding unit. Other features
are a high fertility (average of 5.5 livebirths
in completed sibships) and relatively low
mortality (21%) before the age of reproduction. Due to these peculiarities they show a
very low index of total selection intensity,
the contributions of mortality and fertility
to the index being practically equal.
