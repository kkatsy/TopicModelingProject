Breast-feeding: Its Effects on
Post-partum Amenorrhea

P. C. Saxena

International Institute for Population Studies
Bombay, India

 

ABSTRACT: Data is presented on lactation and post-partum amenorrhea for 323 women in
Banaras, India, ages 15-35 who had one live birth and for 250 women with two live births. Data
on prolonged breast-feeding habits and amenorrhea show that the mean duration of lactation is
about two-and-a-half times the mean duration of post-partum amenorrhea. It appears that an
increase in the duration of breast-feeding is accompanied by an increase in the length of
post-partum amenorrhea. The average period of amenorrhea was shorter in cases where lactation
ceased because of infant mortality under age three months. Lactation and post-partum
amenorrhea have coefficients of correlation of 0.275 and 0.257 in the case of first and second
births respectively. While small, the figures are statistically significant. The use of gamma also
showed that lactation probably has some effect on post-partum amenorrhea.

The need to measure the changes in the
fertility behavior of a population through
increasingly realistic stochastic models has
stimulated considerable interest in the
study of physiological factors affecting
fertility, such as lactation and post-partum
amenorrhea. In formulating models for
the number of births or the number of
conceptions to a couple during a specified
time, Perrin and Sheps (1964), Sheps and
Perrin (1966), Singh (1963, 1968), Singh
and Bhattacharya (1970) and Pathak
(1970) have assumed a constant duration
for the “rest period” comprising the duration of pregnancy and _ post-partum
amenorrhea. Srinivasan (1966), in his
model! for inter-live birth intervals, assumes the distribution of post-partum
amenorrhea to be an asymmetrical
triangle, while Yadava (1966) takes it to
be a chi-square distribution. Each of them
has given his own reasonings, supported
by the nature of the data used, for his
approximations. It has been observed by
the author (Saxena, 1966), and in other
studies as well, that the length of

amenorrhea varies from woman to woman. Factors associated with lactation are
believed to play a fundamental role in the
variation. Henry (1956), Tietze (1961),
Potter (1963), Potter et al. (1965), Salber et
al. (1965), Knodel and Walle (1967), and
Jain et al. (1970) have tried to prove
through direct or indirect evidence, that
lactation affects resumption of menstruation after childbirth.

The purpose of this paper is to present
original data on lactation and post-partum
amenorrhea collected in a demographic
survey conducted by the author in
Banaras (Saxena, 1966, ms.) and to analyze within the limits of the data the effect,
if any, of lactation on the resumption of
menstruation after childbirth.

The information collected in the survey
relate to the fertility history of a sample of
709 couples, which covered nearly half of
the population engaged in clerical occupations in Banaras Hindu University. However, the information pertaining to
lactation and post-partum amenorrhea
presented here was available only for 323

women who had had at least one live birth
and were in the age range 15~35 years at
the time of survey. Out of 323 first-order
live births, 42 died in infancy and the
remaining 281 children survived more
than a year. In the case of second-order
live births, the data on the durations of
lactation and post-partum amenorrhea
were available for 250 women. Among 250
second-order live births, 27 infant deaths
were recorded; the remaining 223 children
survived more than a year.

All the couples were personally interviewed by the author. However, the
woman was contacted through her husband for collecting the data on durations
of lactation and post-partum amenorrhea
when her husband could not furnish the
same. Generally, the information on
post-partum amenorrhea could not be
provided by male respondents at first contact. They were given a schedule (in the
local language) to be filled in consultation
with their wives and were requested to

- record the information only when they

were sure about the duration of postpartum amenorrhea.

In this context, it would be appropriate
to mention that this sample is from a traditional Hindu society living in the eastern
part of Uttar Pradesh where various customs and taboos are still prevalent and
strictly observed. One of the taboos,

Social Biology

which the majority strictly adhered to, is
that a woman during her menstrual flow
remains secluded and is not allowed to
prepare food for other family members. So
it is hoped that resumption of menstruation (determined by one regular cycle)
after a childbirth, being thus connected
with an activity restriction, might have
been correctly reported by the couples,
and we have less reason than in most cases
to suspect that lapses in recalling the
duration of post-partum amenorrhea after
a childbirth are of serious dimensions.

PATTERNS OF BREAST-FEEDING

LACTATION IN THE FIRST TWO SUCCESSIVE
BIRTHS

Among the couples to which the present
data relate, long breast-feeding habits are
customary. If the infant survives, lactation is continued in the majority of the
cases for two years or even more, and
sometimes it is extended into the next
pregnancy. Data on the breast-feeding
patterns for the first two successive births
to a woman are given in Table 1. It should
be noted that cases involving infant
deaths, where lactation was interrupted,
are deleted from the table.

It is observed that the two distributions
have more or less the same pattern. The
durations of breast-feeding following first
and second births seem to be related to

each other as indicated by the coefficient
of correlation (0.78). Generally, the pattern of breast-feeding in the case of the
first two successive births for a given
mother is approximately the same, provided both the children survive.

INFANT MORTALITY, LACTATION, AND
POST-PARTUM AMENORRHEA

It has been observed that all the mothers of the present sample nursed their children right after their confinements, and in
all the cases breast-feeding was continued
till the death of the infant. Obviously, infant mortality interrupted breast-feeding,
and the duration of lactation is then equal
to the age of the infant at death.

The length of amenorrhea along with
the duration of lactation following the
birth of those children who died in infancy
are given in Table 2. The length of postpartum amenorrhea and of lactation are
shown following first and second births
when the infant survived either 0-3
months or 4-12 months. It is seem from
the table that the average length of
amenorrhea increased when the infant

survived between four and twelve months
as compared with cases where the child
died within three months. Results similar
to first-order births have been obtained in
the case of second births, where a difference in the mean lengths of post-partum
amenorrhea for the two durations of
breast-feeding considered here is also
found.

LACTATION AND POST-PARTUM AMENORRHEA
FOLLOWING FIRST AND SECOND BIRTHS

More precise evidence of prolonged
breast-feeding habits and the influence of
lactation on post-partum amenorrhea can
be gathered from Tables 3 and 4. The
tables show the length of post-partum
amenorrhea by the duration of lactation
following first and second births respectively.

It is observed that for the majority of
the nursing mothers, lactation outlasts
amenorrhea. However, 8.5 per cent of the
women in the case of the first birth, and
nearly the same proportion (8.1 per cent)
in the case of the second birth, have
stopped breast-feeding prior to the onset of

From both the tables it appears that an
increase in the duration of breast-feeding
is accompanied by an increase in the average length of post-partum amenorrhea. It

0.257 in the case of the second birth,
figures which are statistically significant.
The fitted regression lines are

Y = 0.1334 X + 3.9421
and

Y = 0.1379 X + 4.3609

where Y denotes the duration of postpartum amenorrhea and X the duration of
lactation.

However, a more appropriate index for
investigating the relationship between lactation and post-partum amenorrhea is
gamma, proposed by Goodman and Kruskal (1954, 1963), which measures the association between them and not simply the
linear relationship as does the correlation
coefficient. This index of association is appropriate in situations where both
classifications have intrinsic and relevant
order.

For the present data, let us consider the
two polytomies defined according to the
durations of lactation and post-partum
amenorrhea where direct ordering is of interest. Suppose that two mothers, each of
whom nursed her first child, are taken
independently and at random from the
population (Table 3), and the respective
durations of post-partum amenorrhea and
of lactation for each mother are noted. We
calculated the conditional probabilities
that these two randomly chosen mothers
will have the same order in both the
classifications and also for unlike orders,
given no tie. These conditional prob
49

abilities, values of gamma and the 95 per
cent confidence limits for gamma obtained
for the first and the second births, are
given in Table 5.

Clearly, there seems to be a greater
chance of like order than of unlike order,
meaning, thereby, positive association.
This finding implies that if two women are
chosen at random from the population of
mothers who breast-fed their children and
if the duration of lactation in the case of
the first woman is longer than the other,
the chances are greater that the postpartum amenorrhea of the former will also
be longer than that of the latter.

IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

On the basis of the information presented, it can be conjectured that, generally, the pattern of breast-feeding for the
first two successive births for a given
mother is approximately the same, provided both children survive. The
coefficient of correlation between the
durations of lactation in the case of first
and second child is 0.78. In both the cases,
on the average, mothers nursed for about
fifteen months.

As pointed out by the author (Saxena,
1966), the average duration of postpartum amenorrhea in the present sample
is short as compared with the average
length of this period in various studies
conducted in different parts of India (see
Baxi, 1957, p. 49; Dandekar, 1959, p. 62;
and Potter et al., 1965, p. 394). It may,
however, be mentioned that the mothers

in those studies breast-fed their children for
more or less the same length of time as in
the present sample. Since we restricted our
analysis to first and second births only, the
women were mostly younger, and this fact
might account for a shorter duration of
amenorrhea.

Although we have observed no statistically significant differences in the average
duration of lactation for male and female
children, it appeared that a male child, on
the average, was breast-fed for a longer
period than a female child. For example,
among first-order births 39 males as
compared to 28 females and for secondorder births 25 males as against 13 females
were breast-fed for more than 24 months.
It is usually seen that a male child is more
carefully brought up and, therefore,
breast-feeding might have been prolonged. Also, the mean length of postpartum amenorrhea following a male birth
was comparatively longer, although not
long enough to be statistically significant.
This area deserves further investigation.

Equally important here would be to
discuss the findings on the length of postpartum amenorrhea where breast-feeding
ceased due to the death of the infant. It is
observed that the average period of
amenorrhea is shorter in cases where the
infant died within three months. Since
breast-feeding was continued till the death
of the infant, the child who survived
longer was obviously nursed for a longer
period of time. As the observations suggest, the difference in the average lengths
of amenorrhea may be attributed to the
difference in the durations of breastfeeding.

As regards the length of amenorrhea
when the child survived more than a year,
it has been observed that the average
period of amenorrhea increased with the
increase in the duration of breast-feeding.
It seems that lactation and post-partum

Social Biology

amenorrhea are loosely interrelated, the
coefficients of correlation being 0.275 and
0.257 in the case of first and second births
respectively. Although these coefficients
appear to be small when compared with
values found in other similar studies, they
are statistically significant. However, it is
felt that the coefficient of correlation may
not be appropriate here to measure the
relationship between lactation and amenorrhea. An index gamma is probably better for investigating the relationship between them, because it is based upon more
general assumptions and compares the
probabilities of like and unlike orders in
the two polytomies defined according to
the durations of lactation and amenorrhea.

From the observed data, these probabilities were calculated for two women
chosen independently and at random. If
the first woman’s lactation period 1s longer
than that of the second woman, the probability is higher that the first woman’s
amenorrhea will also be longer than that
of the other.

From the evidence gathered here and
through other studies, it may be concluded
that breast-feeding has some effect (although not very explicit) on post-partum
amenorrhea. All the same, it may not be
the sole agent responsible for prolonging
amenorrhea. There may be physiological,
dietary, and other factors that affect the
resumption of ovulation after the termination of a pregnancy.
