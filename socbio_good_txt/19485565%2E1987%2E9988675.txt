Household Influences on Childhood Mortality:

Evidence from Historical
and Recent Mortality Trends

Alaka M. Basu

ABSTRACT: In recent years there has been a spate of cross-sectional research, mainly linking
maternal education and child mortality experience, to suggest that family factors, centering
around maternal attitudes, knowledge, and abilities, are important determinants of childhood
mortality levels. This paper examines another line of evidence to support this hypothesis—that
derived from secular trends in mortality. By examining differences in the age structure of mortality declines between the developed and the developing countries, and within these two
groups, and reviewing the major influences on overall mortality declines in these two groups of
countries, we attempt to link falls in childhood mortality with social changes, especially at the
individual or behavioral level as measured by female education.

In recent years there has been a spate
of research, mainly based on data from
the developing countries, to suggest that
household (especially maternal) attributes are an important determinant of
childhood mortality (Caldwell, 1979;
Arriaga, 1979; Ramnath, 1980; Haines
and Avery, 1982; Frenzen and Hogan,
1982; and Abdul-Aziz and Preston,
1982). The hypothesis is that the willingness and ability of the family to prevent
child deaths exert an effect quite independent of the income level of the
household and its external environment, including the medical services
theoretically at its disposal. According
to Caldwell (1979), the mother is of
prime importance in this situation, and
it is her knowledge, autonomy in household decision-making, and ability to interact with outside agencies, that define
the level of household child mortality
even if the outer limits are set by the economic resources of the household and
the medical facilities in its area. Education, it is alleged, is a crucial determinant of these three attributes, and hence
the frequently observed link between

maternal education and childhood mortality.

All the studies which have focused on
this relationship have tended to use
cross-sectional data to establish differentials in child mortality experience according to the educational level of the
mother. In this paper a different approach is used to support the same hypothesis. Age patterns of long-term historical mortality declines are determined, and an attempt made to relate
falls in child mortality to indicators of
rising maternal competence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This analysis is conducted separately
for the developed and developing countries, and from this it emerges that overall rises in life expectancies have been
composed of different age patterns of
mortality decline at different times and
in different places. Moreover, these patterns can be quite neatly related to the
known influences on the drop in Crude
Death Rates in these different times and

188

places. More specifically, in the context
of the present paper, it is seen that:

1. Changes in childhood mortality are
often dissociated from changes in overall
mortality levels and tend to follow their
own course, which can vary quite substantially from one area to another and at
different times. That is, childhood (including infant) mortality may not begin to
decline at the same time or at the same
pace as mortality at the older ages.

2. The decline in childhood mortality,
once initiated, may not stop even if the
decline in general mortality slows down
or Stops at levels less than those obtained
elsewhere.

3. This variation in the course of childhood mortality trends can be related to
variations in the onset of social change
(particularly at the individual level, as
measured by female literacy and education), as opposed to purely economic development or medical advances.

These conclusions are consistent with
the hypothesis that a fall in child mortality is influenced by other factors besides
those influencing general mortality. If
changing attitudes and behavior is one
of these factors, it is quite plausible that
these changes begin somewhat later
than the economic development and
public health, and public health and
medical technology changes, which are
believed to have initiated large scale declines in overall mortality in the developed and developing countries respectively. But even when the latter have
slowed down or become difficult to
maintain, it is still very possible that the
change in individual perceptions and
abilities, being an accelerating process,
continues and carries with it further declines in childhood mortality.

Before examining the evidence for
the above conclusions, some important
qualifications must be stressed. The
most important of course is the problem
of data availability, reliability, and comparability. The problem is especially

Basu

 

Social Biology

acute for data on infant and child mortality, where information from vital statistics is generally inadequate, and indirect estimation requires several assumptions to be made. Add to this the
present requirement for data at least at
two points in time (preferably more often, to avoid relying on freak cases), and
it is quite likely that the selection of areas with adequate data for the present
analysis introduces a bias in the kind of
results obtained.

Secondly, the base levels of childhood mortality are probably important
while looking at the causes of declines.
But the present analysis does maintain
some uniformity by concentrating on
the transition from fairly low levels of
expectation of life at birth, which were
characterized everywhere by high infant
and child mortality, In fact the proposition is that wide variations in infant and
childhood mortality first emerge as life
expectancies rise.

Thirdly, the present hypothesis does
not preclude the role of other influences
on the course of declining child mortality. But it is stated that these are complementary to the overriding importance of
changes in maternal knowledge, attitudes, and practices. In a related context, it should be pointed out that this is
not equivalent to saying that high childhood mortality is intentional (as proposed, for example, by Scrimshaw,
1978). The present hypothesis is much
weaker and says that a decline in child
mortality (as opposed to the maintainence of high child mortality levels)
requires an element of volition at the individual or family level, in that it involves a change in values and attitudes,
especially toward the child, increased
knowledge (both processes in either order of occurrence), and, finally, modified behavior to accord with these
changed attitudes and new knowledge.

Finally, it would be useful to disaggregate childhood mortality (that is, between the ages of 0 and 4) wherever possible. It is likely, for example, that a fall
in neonatal mortality is not as dependent on changing attitudes and behavior
as post-neonatal mortality and, even
more so, mortality at the 14 ages. This
could partly explain why mortality at
ages 1-4 has been found to be high relative to the Infant Mortality Rate in
places such as India (for example, Wyon
and Gordon, 1971), Bangladesh (Committee on Population and Demography,
1981) and sub-Saharan Africa (Azefor,
1981). The decline in infant mortality
caused by exogeneous factors like improved and widespread medical technology could still maintain high levels of
child mortality because the infants saved
are entering early childhood without the
simultaneous changes necessary to increase their survival beyond the age of
one. Unfortunately, the data available
seldom permit us to distinguish between
neonatal and post-neonatal, or between
infant and child mortality. Instead,
heavy reliance may have to be placed on
summary measures of ages 0-4 mortality or even the use of infant mortality as
a proxy for childhood mortality. But we
hope the latter assumption will not be
presumptuous, at least while looking at
historical declines in the developed
countries, where short durations of
breastfeeding meant that infants were
soon exposed to all the hazards of early
childhood.

RESULTS
THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

A slow and irregular decline in mortality in the present-day developed
countries had begun as early as the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centu
Childhood Mortality 189

ries. By 1850, Northern and Western
Europe saw steadily increasing gains in
life expectancies, with the largest gains
during the first two decades of the twentieth century and in the years immediately after World War II (United Nations, 1973). McKeown (1976) estimates
that the total fall in mortality in England
between 1700 and 1971 can be justly distributed as follows: 1700 to 1848-54, 33
percent; 1848-54 to 1901, 20 per cent;
and 1901 to 1971, 47 per cent. But the
Scandinavian countries probably
achieved the fastest and greatest falls in
death rates during the earlier phases of
this mortality transition. Expectation of
life at birth crossed 40 years as early as in
the 1820’s in Sweden and stood at 55.7
years by 1900 (United Nations, 1973).
In contrast, steady falls in mortality
in Other parts of Europe, including European Russia, began much later, toward the end of the nineteenth century,
but were much more rapid (Stolnitz,
1955) so that they soon narrowed the
gaps between themselves and the early
starters. This more rapid decline in
Crude Death Rates continued well into
the present century and by the late
1960’s there was little in these rates to
distinguish the pioneers from the laggards in the developed countries.
CDR’s all fell in the narrow range of 812 deaths per thousand population.
However, the different groups of
contries beginning their mortality transitions at different times did not display
identical age patterns of mortality declines. True, the general trend was a
movement from a U-shaped curve of
Age Specific Mortality Rates to a Jshaped one. But the exact paths they followed to reach this end varied considerably, as is evident from several direct
and indirect sources. Perhaps the best
evidence is found in the regional model
life table system generated by Coale and

190

Demeny (1966). These tables are based
on the actual mortality experience of
populations from the mid-nineteenth
century to the late 1950’s, as represented by 192 national and subnational
populations. The fact that the authors
found it convenient to divide the life tables so obtained into different groups,
based on distinct region-specific age patterns of mortality at similar levels of
overall life expectations at birth, is
strong indication that the relation between mortality changes at the younger
and older ages as death rates fall is not
the same for different areas at different
times. Moreover, the differences in the
age patterns of mortality in the four regional models also vary in character as
one moves from higher to lower levels of
mortality. The experience from the developed countries therefore is that the
same end-level of expectation of life at
birth can be reached with quite different
age patterns of mortality change under
different circumstances.

An examination of the timing and
tempo of declines in childhood mortality
for those developed countries (mainly in
Western Europe) for which reliable data
are available far back enough in time
suggests that the hypothesis that social
change at the individual or family level is
an important determinant of such declines is a plausible one. Or, to put it
more weakly, the evidence is at least not
incompatible with such a hypothesis,
which is a fair achievement given the
nature of the hypothesis and the limitations of the empirical data available to
support or refute it.

In England, for example, mortality
between the ages of five and forty-five
had begun declining significantly very
early in the eighteenth century (Logan,
1950; Peller, 1948), and Hollingsworth

Basu

 

Social Biology

(1965) concludes from an examination
of changes in life expectancy at age five
that the center of the period of rapidly
falling mortality in the general population of England was in fact as early as
about 1755. McKeown (1976) estimates
that during the nineteenth century as
well the fall in mortality was proportionately greatest at the later childhood and
young adult ages.

On the other hand, major improvements in infant and early childhood
mortality did not begin until the end of
the nineteenth century. For example,
Wrigley and Schofield (1983), using reconstitution data from five counties in
England which they think are representative of the country as a whole, find little
decisive fall in child mortality even until
the last quarter of the eighteenth century, as shown in Table 1. Even the
1838-54 life table for England and
Wales shows 26 per cent of children
dying by the age of five. Moreover, this
figure is not much lower, at 23 per cent,
for the 1891-1900 life table (Hollingsworth, 1965).

(1976) concludes that while mortality
from air-borne infections had begun to
fall by the 1850's, it was not until the end
of the nineteenth century that there was
an appreciable decline in deaths from
water and food-borne diseases—the
major infant and young child killers.

What were the major influences on
the overall mortality declines during this
entire period? Although the details of
the role of different factors in reducing
mortality continue to be a matter of
some controversy, over the years a consensus has emerged on the view that the
widespread application of advances in
preventive and curative medicine could
not have had a major impact on falling
death rates until the 1930’s and were certainly not responsible for initiating secular falls in mortality. Since sustained declines in mortality did take place before
the 1930's in the present-day industrialized countries, in these countries the debate has centered less and less on the relative merits of the socioeconomic
development versus medical technology
case to explain mortality decline. But
this is not to state that there is no argument about the determinants of rises in
life expectancies until the 1930’s. For
even the socioeconomic factors underlying industrialization and urbanization,
and plausibly reducing mortality, are
several, and include developments in
housing, agriculture, environmental
sanitation, personal hygiene, medical
services, and health consciousness
among the people; and it has just not
been possible to quantify their separate
influences.

However, even if it is not possible to
measure separately the effects of all
these factors at any one time, it is at least
possible to identify the calender periods
during which specific factors could have

first assumed importance, an exercise
which is now attempted.

It is now believed that the slow rise in
population growth rates as early as the
beginning of the eighteenth century was
a result not so much of a fall in general
death rates as a lowering of the peaks of
mortality which erupted during regular
epidemics and famines in earlier times
(Helleiner, 1965; United Nations,
1973). These declines in “catastrophic
mortality” predated the process of industrialization and, in England and
Wales at least, have been attributed to
rising nutritional levels as subsistence
crises in agriculture occurred less frequently and were less often followed by
epidemic diseases (McKeown and
Brown, 1955). Similar conclusions have
been drawn to explain the early nineteenth century falls in mortality in the
rest of Northern and Western Europe.
Writing in 1886, the noted French statistician and doctor Leon-Clergy Vacher
dismissed as negligible the role of medical advances in significant mortality reductions occurring until that time. To
begin with, he felt that:

It is certain that consumption has increased significantly everywhere. It is
also certain that this increased consumption of basic necessities has improved resistance to disease, increased the vitality
of men and women, and diminished mortality rates in all of Europe. These results
are more the work of scientific and industrial revolution than that of any political
revolution.

The processes involved were essentially technological and economic and
included greater productivity of land
and labor with improved farming techniques, advances in transportation, better methods of food storage, and rising
wages with industrialization. Social
changes, especially at the individual

level, were not yet an important factor
in reducing mortality risks. For example, Oddy (1970), while examining
nineteenth-century English diets, concluded that the average low-income Englishman could have had a much more
nutritious diet at a lower price if he had
been prepared to change his consumption patterns and that this might be a
contributory factor in the observed paradox between the rise in real wages and
the low standards in nutrition and health
in England at the turn of the twentieth
century. Confirmed cynics will be gratified by Oddy’s further conclusion that
even if the people had understood dietary requirements, it is still not certain
that better diets would have resulted, so
strong is the pull of culture and habit.
After the middle of the nineteenth
century, however, greater social consciousness led to sanitary reform and
public health movements which began
to assume increasing importance as factors influencing mortality declines. As
the relationship between an unclean environment and disease became more
recognized (by pioneers like Edwin
Chadwick in England and Lemnel Shattuck in the United States), there was
pressure for greater involvement of the
state in public health issues, an event
which undoubtedly led to significant
falls in mortality as new public health
legislation was introduced (McKeown,
1976; United Nations, 1973). Important
community measures included the operation of public agencies for refuse disposal, the construction of sewerage systems, and the purification of water
supplies. As a result of these improvements in public sanitation, mortality
rates from the bowel diseases and from
typhoid declined (McKeown, 1976).
(For a contemporary awareness of the
role of sanitary reform in falling death

rates in other parts of Europe, see Vacher 1886.)

At the same time, social reformers
were able to influence the introduction
of several measures to improve living
and working conditions in England and
other industrializing countries. These
included the gradual raising of the minimum age of employment, shorter working days, safer working conditions,
stricter control of housing standards,
and various private and governmental
social security schemes.

While all the above steps required little initial cooperation from individuals,
they must have had an important effect
on individual attitudes and behavior, if
by nothing else, by the increased knowledge that their publicity conferred.
There is some evidence that this period,
particularly the last quarter of the nineteenth century, saw a greater concern
with personal hygiene. Soap gradually
stopped being a luxury item, and the
substitution of cotton for woolen undergarments at least increased .the ease of
keeping these clean. It has been pointed
out, however, that it is not known with
certainty that the cotton clothing was actually washed more frequently, and that
the increased production of soap could
have been mainly for industrial use
(Krause, 1958).

However, the evidence for changed
behavioral patterns does not rest purely
on production statistics like the above.
An important influence was surely the
gradual rise in literacy and education,
especially as the school curriculum began to include lessons in personal hygiene and in the application of basic
health practices. Although it was as
early as in the last quarter of the nineteenth century that, in England and
Wales at least, the question began to be
seriously considered of providing mass

elementary education, the actual establishment of a national system of elementary education took much longer for various reasons, a major one being an
intense suspicion of interference by the
State in private affairs, the sphere of
“private affairs” being very liberally interpreted. But by the mid-nineteenth
century, this doctrine of /aissez faire was
increasingly challenged as political philosophers like T. H. Green argued for
greater state intervention in social matters, as the mere freedom to do as one
wished included the freedom of the
strong to exploit the weak and this
meant that the weak enjoyed no freedom at all (Wardle, 1976).

In the nineteenth century, therefore,
England and Wales saw the gradual creation of a system of universal education,
although the process lagged behind developments in countries such as France
and the United States. The result was
that from an average attendance of
about 65 per cent of the roll in the
1870's, by the 1890’s attendance figures
were comparable to those of the present
day, and for the first time the great mass
of the child population attended school
regularly for six or seven years (Evans,
1975). In the context of the present paper, even female secondary education
not only expanded greatly during the
last quarter of the nineteenth century,
influenced by the recommendations of
the Taunton Commission Report in
1868, but also, the girls’ schools so set up
also set the trend in adopting more modem and useful curricula and teaching
methods (Evans, 1975).

This period also coincided with the
spread of a less formal kind of education
aimed at changing beliefs and practices
inimical to good health. For example, a
school for mothers was opened in London in 1904, and another in 1907. The

Childhood Mortality 193

health education these schools imparted
was more readily acceptable because the
generation of women passing through
their childbearing life at this time was
also the first to benefit from the Compulsory Education Act of 1870 (Benjamin, 1965). Urban infant welfare centers also rapidly multiplied, and from
1907 an even more personal approach to
education was adopted in London
through health visitors who contacted
new mothers to impart basic information On asepsis, nutrition, and physical
development. All this was coupled of
course with the more ready availability
of clean cow’s milk to weaned infants
(Beaver, 1973).

Regarding the role of advances in
medicine, there is now some consensus
that, except for smallpox vaccination,
these were not a major factor in mortality declines until about 1935 (McKeown,
1976). Most other gains in medical
knowledge were of little practical use
from the patient’s point of view until the
twentieth century, which saw rapid developments both in the prevention of
the previously fatal diseases (including
tuberculosis, thypoid, cholera, measles,
yellow fever, whooping cough, and influenza) and in their cure once these diseases has occurred. The use of sulfonamides and then penicillin and other
antibiotics after the 1930’s, coupled with
the immunizing agents mentioned
above, meant that mortality from several infectious diseases declined to levels lower than had been earlier thought
possible.

To recapitulate, during the late eighteenth and most of the nineteenth centuries, the major possible influences on reductions in overall mortality in the
developed countries were improvements in nutrition and standards of living, and public sanitary reforms, in that

order of occurrence. There is little evidence of major changes in individual attitudes and behavior until the end of the
nineteenth century. While opinions may
differ about the role of such social
changes in promoting falls in childhood
mortality, the timing of the onset of
these falls at least does not contradict
the possibility of such a role.

The second characteristic of the mortality decline in the developed countries
is that though significant improvements
in infant and child mortality lagged behind improvements in mortality at the
older ages, once they had been initiated,
they tended to be greatest at these early
ages (see Table 2).

That is, once infant and childhood
mortality have begun their way downhill, they seem to follow an independent
and rapid course which may or may not
coincide with the paths taken by mortal
ity at other ages. As seen in Table 2, the
first half of the twentieth century saw the
largest reductions in mortality in most
European countries occurring in early
childhood, that is, at about age three,
and the minimum mortality rate, which
earlier occurred at about the fifteenth
year of life, gradually moved downward
(United Nations, 1973).

The quarter century since 1950 has
seen a continuation of this trend in the
developed countries (United Nations,
1982). In general, the greatest declines
in mortality were observed in the youngest age groups and the smallest declines
in the oldest age groups, with the largest
relative decline taking place in the age
group 1-4 years (see Table 3).

The particularly interesting aspect of
Table 3 is that gains in early childhood
mortality have maintained their lead
while the ordering at other ages has of

ages has not matched the improvements
in the younger age groups when measured against the standard of the model
life tables. For females, on the other
hand, the match with the model life tables was closer, and at the older adult
ages there was even a tendency to drift
toward life tables with lower mortality.
This kind of steady and more rapid
decline in childhood mortality is compatible with the suggestion that it is
heavily influenced by social changes at
the individual and family behavioral
level. Such changes tend to generate
their own momentum once they have
been initiated, a momentum which soon
gets divorced from changes in other economic or technological factors, as is
demonstrated more vividly with evidence from the developing countries.

THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

A few countries in this group began a
sustained mortality reduction before the
1940’s, The data available are limited,
but among these exceptions should
probably be included: Argentina, Chile,
Uruguay, and Costa Rica in Latin
America (Palloni, 1981); Sri Lanka,

Taiwan, and Singapore in Asia (U.N.,
1973); and Mauritius and possibly Egypt
in Africa (U.N., 1973).

But the real take-off for mortality decline in the developing countries as a
whole occurred after World War II. The
first couple of decades of this period saw
remarkable gains in life expectancy in
nearly every developing country, often
averaging annual gains of more than one
year in countries as diverse as Taiwan,
Malaysia, Jamaica, Mexico, Sri Lanka,
and Mauritius, the last two recording
gains of two years annually in the 1940’s
and early 1950’s (Gwatkin, 1980). In India, the Crude Death Rate declined
from about 27 per thousand in the 1940's
to about 17 in the 1970’s. In Africa too,
expectation of life at birth seems to have
risen from a low of 30 years in the 1930’s
to a more impressive (though still far
short of potential) figure of 43 years by
the 1960’s (Preston, 1980),

However, unlike the experience of
the developed countries in the present
century where falls in childhood mortality have tended to outstrip gains at other
ages, in the developing world, as Table 4
illustrates, it appears that in the immediate post-war decades which recorded

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

Vol. 34, No. 3-4

the most dramatic falls in Crude Death
Rates, the gains by young adults have
been at least as great, and often higher,
than those by young children. This is
also in contrast to the situation in the
pre-war years where any falls in mortality benefited young children the most, as
for example in Sri Lanka (Sarkar, 1957)
and Jamaica (Roberts, 1950).

Further evidence that in the developing world the relation between childhood and adult mortality has been distorted when compared to that expected
by looking at rises in life expectancies in
the developed countries is available
from the increasingly recognized incompatibility between age-specific death
rates in the developing countries and the
regional model life tables (based mainly
on developed country data) prepared by
Coale and Demeny (1966). Almost all
this incompatibility has arisen from
childhood mortality rates in the underdeveloped countries being higher than
the model life table rates at similar levels
of adult mortality.

For example, Palloni (1981) derived
expected values of 1go and 4q;, or the
probabilities of dying before age one
and between the ages of one and five respectively, using model ‘“‘West”’ of the
Coale-Demeny system, for those Latin
American countries which had reliable
data on és, the life expectancy at age 15,
for the 1970’s. He found that with the
exception of Trinidad and Tobago, the
expected values of ;go were lower than
those actually observed, and with the
exception of Argentina, Chile, and
Trinidad and Tobago, the expected values of 4g; were lower than the observed
values.

Similarly, Adlakha and Kirk (1974)
found the 1968-69 Sample Registration
Scheme (which has been accused of
under-registration if anything) esti

mates of the 0-4 year death rate in India
to be much higher than the rate predicted by applying the SRS life expectancies at age five to the regional model
life table system. This was the case
whichever family of model life tables
was chosen, even the South family with
its much higher level of childhood mortality for a given level of adult mortality.

It is this reduced relevance of model
life table systems based on the recorded
experience of the developed countries
to the declines in mortality in the
present-day developing countries which
has prompted the United Nations Secretariat (1982) to develop a new model life
table system based on the more reliable
of the age- and sex-specific death data
available for the less-developed areas, a
system which is expected to be more applicable to demographic analysis for
these areas.

The overall impression, therefore,
from whatever data sources are available is that gains in mortality at the young
childhood ages in the developing countries have tended to lag behind improvements at older ages (United Nations,
1982; Dyson, 1977). It is also in this age
group of 1-4 years that mortality differentials between the developed and developing countries have become the
most marked. For example, the United
Nations model life table project gives a
death rate of 36 per thousand population for Indian girls aged 1-4 (1970-72
life table) and 27 for boys, compared to
average death rates of 0.83 per thousand
population for boys and 0.66 for girls in
the more developed countries (United
Nations, 1982).

As for causes, the medical advances
which became significant contributors to
falling death rates in the developed
countries only after about two centuries
of economic and social change were of

the kind which could be transferred relatively easily to areas which had reached
very differing levels of social and economic development, as long as the political will existed (which it fortunately
generally did) to implement these new
technologies. That is, the chronological
order of the influences on declining mortality was often completely reversed in
these countries: First came the effect of
the widespread adoption of developments in medicine and public health,
followed after varying intervals of time
by the economic and/or social changes
needed to sustain these falls in mortality.

Several writers have stressed the initial rapidity of the gains in longevity obtained in the underdeveloped countries
compared with the record of the developed countries at similar levels of mortality (see, for example, Stolnitz, 1956).
But, at least at the earlier stages of rises
in life expectancies, this is only to be expected, as the impact of new medical
technologies is more sudden and impressive in the short run than the gradual effect of changes in standards of living. So effective have been these
developments in the prevention and (especially) treatment of disease that the
early post-war years saw an increased
weakening of the relation between economic development and mortality
(Stolnitz, 1965; Arriaga and Davis,
1969; Preston, 1975), a situation in
marked contrast to that obtaining in earlier decades not only in the developed
countries but also in the few developing
areas that saw some pre-war falls in mortality. For example, Arriaga and Davis
(1969) show that in Latin America in the
nineteenth century and up to the 1930's,
the rate of improvement in national
mortality levels was closely linked to a
nation’s level of economic develop
Social Biology

ment; but after 1930 all countries in the
region shared nearly equally in the gains
in longevity, regardless of their level or
rate of economic development. In line is
Diaz-Briquet’s conclusion, from an examination of cause-specific mortality in
Cuba, that public health and sanitary reforms and nutritional improvements
were largely responsible for the country’s initial declines in mortality
throughout the first half of the twentieth
century, while after World War II, the
relevance of economic conditions as a
determinant of mortality decline diminished considerably.

In all these countries, the most important health-technology factors responsible for such dramatic falls in death
rates have probably been anti-malarial
campaigns, immunization against tuberculosis, small pox, and certain other diseases, and antibiotics to treat infectious
and respiratory diseases (Preston,
1978). Asimportant as the development
of the scentific technology involved in
these medical advances has been the fact
that they could be imported by states at
low levels of development and spread by
a massive growth and expansion of public health and medical services.

But having identified the more important medical and public health technologies responsible for large scale declines in mortality in the developing
world, we find the debate about the determinants of mortality decline is by no
means over. For it is far from accepted
that these were the sole factors in the observed mortality decline. As discussed
earlier, it is probably more accurate to
attribute to them the great weakening of
the link between economic and social
development and rises in life expectancies. What all these controversies do
agree on, however, is that the effect of
medical measures on falling death rates

Vol. 34, No. 3-4

tends to taper off unless it is backed by
more general rises in personal living
standards. This is expecially apparent
once health interventions to reduce
mortality have removed the “‘soft rock”
of causes of death, the “hard rock” consisting of factors less amenable to direct
medical contro] and more a function of
poverty and underdevelopment (United
Nations, 1963). Indeed, all indications
are that such slowdowns in the rate of
mortality decline have already occurred
in several parts of the developing world
at levels of mortality well above those
prevailing in the developed countries
(Gwatkin, 1980). Moreover, there has
been a reversal of the trend toward convergence of death rates which was so
typical among the developing countries
during the accelerated mortality decline
of the early post-war years. Both these
events are discernible not only from
whatever reliable mortality data are
available for these countries, but also
from the even more fragmentary causeof-death statistics which show that the
major causes of death are decreasingly
the infectious and parasitic diseases
open to medical interventions and increasingly the less easily attackable gastrointestinal and respiratory ailments.
Preston and Nelson (1974) have concluded from such data that mortality
from diarrhea in the developing world is
typically two to three times higher than
it was in the developed countries at similar overall mortality levels.

Gwatkin (1980) has related these decelerations in the pace of overall mortality declines to the slow rate of progress
in recent economic and social trends in
several developing countries. In the
context of the present paper, which is
concerned with development leading to
changes in individual attitudes and behaviors, rises in population literacy and

 

 

Childhood Mortality 199

education levels are an important factor. And the development of this factor
has been rather uneven in the developing countries. Although educational levels have not generally been specifically
mentioned in the literature on the
causes of overall mortality declines in
the underdeveloped countries, some of
these intercountry variations are worth
noting. For example, by the early
1970’s, the Latin American countries of
E] Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua,
and Peru had 38 per cent or more of
their adult populations illiterate, while
in Costa Rica, Argentina, Chile, and
Uruguay, this figure hovered around 10
per cent (Preston, 1980). Similarly, in
Asia, countries like Sri Lanka and Malaysia with their still high levels of adult
illiteracy of around 20 per cent, nevertheless had fared much better than
Bangladesh (80 per cent), Pakistan (80
per cent), India (40 per cent), and Jordan (62 per cent). In Africa, Mauritius
with an adult illiteracy level of 20 per
cent was about the single exception to
the rule of well over 60 per cent of the
adult population being illiterate. It
should be noted that all these figures of
adult illiteracy are biased downward as
far as female (the more relevant group
for the present hypothesis) illiteracy 1s
concerned, as all the countries display a
marked sex differential in educational
attainment.

Similarly, the developing countries
have had differing levels of success or
failure with attempts to reduce childhood mortality. Just as the differentials
in mortality between the developed and
developing countries are the most
marked at ages under five, so within the
developing countries themselves there is
a wide range of variation in the achievements in lowering child mortality. That
is, the transition from a U-shaped to a J

200 Basu

shaped curve of age-specific mortality in
the developing countries has found different areas with greatly differing
lengths of the left hand side of the curve
at the same point of time. Indeed, the
United Nations life table project
(United Nations Secretariat, 1982),
based on the mortality experience of less
developed countries, has identified four
distinct age patterns of mortality in addition to a residual category of life tables
more akin to the Coale-Demeny West
system. For example, the life tables for
India, the Matlab thana area of Bangladesh, Iran, Tunisia, Pakistan, Nepal,
and Turkey all display characteristics of
what has been labelled the ‘South
Asian” pattern—very high mortality
rates under age fifteen and high rates
again at the older ages, with correspondingly lower mortality in the prime age
groups.

That is, age patterns of mortality
change in the developing world are not
only distinct from those that occurred
during the mortality transition in the developed countries, they also show significant variations among themselves.
And where falls in childhood mortality
are concerned, these variations can often be linked to the possible influence of
social (especially behavioral) change on
these falls. Where the mortality decline
has been predominantly or even solely
guided by medical factors, the tendency
has been for childhood mortality to decline much less rapidly than when the
rise in life expectancy has also been accompanied by developments in literacy
and education, particularly of females.
While such developments can generally
be subsumed under general socioeconomic growth, they can also occur without such growth. The case of Jamaica
and Sri Lanka, where mortality declines

before the medica] and public health
revolutions were characterized by
greater gains in early childhood than at
the older ages, have already been mentioned. But even in the post-war falls in
overall mortality in the developing
world, there has been a distinct pattern
of countries with greater social change
displaying greater falls in child mortality.

Taking Latin America as an example, Palloni (1981) calculated for those
countries with reliable data the expected
values of 4g; given their levels of e;5 in
the early 1970's, had these countries followed the European-North American
mortality experience as represented by
the Coale-Demeny West model life table system. It is true that in almost all
cases the expected values were lower
than those actually observed, but within
themselves they fell into two distinct
groups. Cuba, Costa Rica, Uruguay,
Barbados, Argentina, Chile, and Trinidad and Tobago formed a separate cluster of nations with distinctly lower excess childhood mortality than the rest of
the countries. Interestingly, these are
the very Latin American countries
where, by the early 1970’s, adult female
literacy had reached levels of 90 per cent
or more (UNESCO, 1982). On the
other hand, the largest deviations were
seen in those countries with the least
success in combating female illiteracy—
Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador,
El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Mexico, and Paraguay. All these countries had well over 35 per cent of their
adult female populations illiterate by
the early 1970’s (UNESCO, 1982).

In Asia, Sri Lanka represents the special case of a country where social development has followed an independent
course from economic growth, with ef

fects on overall mortality declines which
are still being analyzed. To recapitulate
the postulated influences on the dramatic falls in crude death rates in Sri
Lanka: Before 1946 the major influence
was the economic and social change that
the country witnessed. After World
War II and to the mid-1950’s, mortality
benefited from a continuation of at least
this social change together with the
medical prophylaxis and therapy developments of the West, including an intensive malaria eradication campaign. In
the 1960’s and 1970’s whatever mortality
declines have occurred must be attributed to the limited economic growth but
continuing social development that has
been taking place, including the fact that
between 1953 and 1971, the percentage
of females aged ten and above that were
literate rose from 53.6 to 70.9 per cent
(Meegama, 1981).

Table 5 contains the annual rates of
decline in age-specific mortality in Sn
Lanka between 1920-22 and 1971. And
the figures fit in quite well with the hypothesis that childhood mortality declines are greatest when the primary influence on mortality is social change.
Before 1947, infants and young children
were the greatest beneficiaries of declines in mortality; between 1945-47
and 1952-54 the gains were greatest
among the young adult groups; and after 1952-54, children aged one to four
have shown the relatively largest declines, which have been sustained even
after a deceleration in the rate of overall
mortality decline has set in, as in the
1960’s and some age groups even experienced a rise in death rates.

In India, on the other hand, the overall rise in female education and therefore, by extension, presumably the

change in attitudes and behavior, has
been far less spectacular and so has been
the decline in childhood mortality. The
United Nations (1982) life table for India for the 1970-72 estimated for ages 1—
4a male death rate of 27 and a female
one of 36, in contrast to Sri Lanka’s vital
registration rates of 5 and 6 respectively.

However, it makes more sense to
compute childhood mortality rates for a
country as large and diverse as India on
a more regional basis, and once this is
done there is seen to be a distinct geographical pattern. Using indirect techniques to estimate 2qo values from the
1965-66 National Sample Survey, Bhat,
Preston, and Dyson (1984) found that
all the southern states, including Maharashtra, had relatively low childhood
mortality compared to their adult mortality levels, while all the central and
northwestern states, except Haryana,
had relatively high childhood mortality
compared to their adult mortality levels.
This is compatible with the cultural and

 

social differences in the two groups of
states which result in much higher levels
of female literacy and autonomy in the
southern states (see Table 6 and Dyson
and Moore, 1983).

And once more, as it does on measures of female education, so too in
childhood mortality, the state of Kerala
Stands apart even from the other relatively low child mortality states in the
south. Not only are childhood mortality
estimates for this state significantly
lower than in the rest of the country,
urban-rural differentials are much less
marked (in keeping with the low urbanrural differentials in female literacy and
the more equitable distribution of
health services). It is the one state which
has steadily maintained declines in child
mortality in spite of relative stagnation
of economic growth. This last fits in with
the hypothesis that declines in childhood mortality tend to have their own
momentum, being influenced by the
kind of social changes which are selfDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

accelerating processes which soon become independent of growth on other
fronts.

CONCLUSION

It has been suggested in this paper
that declines in childhood mortality, as
distinct from declines in general mortality, require an element of volition at the
household or individual level and can
therefore be analyzed within a framework similar to that commonly used for
examining changes in fertility. Support
for this hypothesis was sought from information which suggests that declines
in childhood mortality are related to
changes in other indicators of individual, especially maternal, knowledge, attitudes and practices, viz., social
changes. Though socioeconomic
changes were often used as a proxy for
social changes where differentiation was
not possible, it should be noted that
while such social development generally

Childhood Mortality

203

accompanies economic development,
rapid economic growth is not always a
necessary condition for the kind of social change we are concerned with, as
was illustrated with a few specific examples. Here, wherever possible, changes
is female education and literacy were
considered as a more direct proxy for
changes in maternal attributes.

It is stated that the coincidence between changes in this index of behavior
and changes in child mortality, and the
absence of a similar coincidence between developments in the known influences on overall mortality and
changes in child mortality, do not refute
the possibility that family (especially
maternal) behavior is an important determinant of childhood mortality.
