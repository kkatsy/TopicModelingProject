Interval Between Age at Marriage and

First Birth in India

Kanti Pakrasi and Chittaranjan Malaker

Indian Statistical Institute
Calcutta, India

In his study of sixty four sample populations drawn from all over the world, Ford
(1945) pointed out the surprising infrequency of childbearing by adolescent girls.
His finding strengthens the theory of
“adolescent sterility” of Ashley-Montagu
(1939). Critical assessments of this theory
are available to bear out its import in the
field of fertility research (Beebe, 1942;
Lorimer, 1954). With respect to the problems of human fertility in general, several
pioneering studies on trends and differentials in age at marriage and the timing of
births have already been made in different
populations (Royal Commission on Population, 1950; Fortes, 1954; Das Gupta et al.,
1955; Sovani and Dandekar, 1955; Grabill,
Kiser, and Whelpton, 1958; Whelpton,
Campbell, and Patterson, 1966). Pursuant
to these studies, we have undertaken the
present study with the approach that
among reproductively mature women the
interval between menarche, effective marriage, and first pregnancy does constitute a
“highly variable” phenomenon which affects
the trends and differentials in the timing of
first births.

In this paper we have attempted to
examine the following three biosocial issues:

1. What is the mean interval between

 

 

age at marriage and first birth among reproductively mature women in India?

2. Is there any perceptible difference in
age at marriage and the timing of first birth
among Indian women belonging to different
socioeconomic groups?

3. What is the nature of the distribution of the average number of months between effective marriage and first birth
within and between social classes in India?

MATERIAL AND METHODS

In examining the above three issues, we
have utilized a portion of the survey data
collected from urban families of Calcutta,
West Bengal. For the collection of relevant
data, approximately 12,000 households were
selected from the city, excluding certain
areas with predominantly non-Bengali
population, A master sample of 6,884
couples was obtained from the sampled
households in the selected urban blocks
with details regarding age, age at effective
marriage, education, occupation of married
members, etc. (Poti, Malaker, and Chakraborti, 1960). Finally, 1,018 couples were
chosen at random in varying proportions
from three broad socioeconomic strata for
detailed fertility investigations. In this
selection a special effort was made to satisfy

103

104. Brief Reports

these conditions: (@) both husband and
wife residing in the same household; (6)
couples married only once; (c) wife’s age
not exceeding 40 years; and (d) couples
belonging definitely to any one of the following three socioeconomic groups of the
city, (I.) Higher Professions and Services—
physicians, engineers, office executives,
wholesale business, (II.) Lower Professions
and Services—clerks, supervisors, retail
traders, and (III.) Manual Laborers—
skilled and unskilled. These social classes
were identified jointly on the basis of husband’s occupational standing, his as well as
his wife’s educational attainment, and gainful employment of wife.

The complete fertility history recorded
for each couple among 1,018 couples has
been thoroughly examined to ascertain
mother’s age at effective marriage and age
at first birth. We encountered the common
difficulty of other investigators in getting
correct age returns in sample inquiries
(Das Gupta et al., 1955; Sovain and Dandekar, 1954). Moreover, problems of “recall lapse” were also encountered, but it
may be assumed that this problem played a
minimum role due to various checks which
were adopted for the survey.

For each couple under investigation,
husband and wife were independently interviewed by male and female investigators respectively. In case there occurred any
serious discrepancies between husband’s

‘and wife’s reporting, especially on age at

marriage, age at several births, the respondents were again interviewed by the supervisors to reconcile all discrepancies (Poti,
Malaker, and Chakraborti, 1962). In this
matter, the help of the family elders was
sought to get confirmation of the reportings
made by a couple on its fertility history.
Marriage and/or birth certificates were collected from the elderly kinfolk of the
family in the absence of any officially sponsored documents.

 

Social Biology

For the study, the minimum interval between marriage and first birth has been assumed to be 10 months. Premarital conception in Indian families is negligible, and
the exact interval between marriage and
stillbirth or abortion is very difficult to obtain correctly. Births occurring in Jess than
ten months could not be ascertained in the
survey and hence a limitation is imposed.
The factors noted above indicate the nature
of the limitations in the information given
about mother’s age at marriage and age at
first and subsequent births.

We examined mother’s age at marriage
under five broad age groups: below 16
years, 16-18 years, 18-20 years, 20-22
years, and 22 years and above. On the
other hand, the interval between age at
effective marriage and first birth has been
classified by four distinct time phases by
months: 12-18, 18-30, 30-42, and more
than 42 months. These groupings were applied uniformly to all couples, irrespective
of social class. In so doing, it was found
that for social class III the number of
mothers in different cells latticed by age
groups of 18~20, 20-22 and 22, and all
interval groups were very small. Accordingly, the average interval (months) among
the wives of class III has been examined
for only three age groups, namely, below 16
yrs, 16-18 years, and above 18 years.

For each social class, the mean and the
standard deviation of interval between age
at effective marriage and the first live birth
have been calculated with respect to each
one of the given groups of age at effective
marriage and also for all groups combined.
We have also examined the most frequently
reported interval, that is, the mode for
each social class. The distribution of the
interval between age at marriage and first
live birth has also been studied for all
social classes.

For the purpose of the present study,
we could utilize relevant fertility histories

 
Vol. 20, No. 1

of only 906 couples. A further scrutiny
revealed that 45 couples belonging to all
classes reported no birth even within 5
years from the date of their effective marriage. These couples (5% of total) were
excluded from the study. Of these 45
couples, 9, 14 and 22 belonged to social
classes I, IY, and III, respectively. With
this exclusion, we had 207 couples in class

mean interval and standard deviation as
obtained for the wives of different age
groups within social classes I and IJ are
very close, while wives of class III did
differ from their counterparts in the former
two classes.

The number of wives having their first
pregnancy terminations within 30 months
from the time of effective marriage accounted for 78% of class I, 74% of class
II and 64% of class III. Irrespective of
social classes, the large majority of the given
reproductively mature women did have
their first births within 2.5 years after eifective marriage. Most revealing is the fact
that the couples of the highest social class
of the city experienced the observed specific
interval (30 months) relatively in maximum strength. Moreover, when 35% of
the wives of class III showed the interval
to be only 18 months against a little more
than 40% of the wives of class I or
II, it appears that differential socioeconomic status might have played a significant role.

Again, regarding the several groups classified by age at effective marriage, it is
observed that the average interval declines
steadily with increasing age at marriage in
all social classes. Attention is drawn to the
fact that in social class III the wives
belonging to the marriage-age group of
below 16 years mark the highest mean
interval (30 months). Further, it is in the
class of manual laborers we find the maximum difference between two mean intervals
(7 months), and this difference is observed
to occur between the first two successive
marriage-age groups. In the other two
higher socioeconomic groups, the difference
between any two successive marriage-age
groups does not exceed 4 months.

Variability in the interval also declines
with increasing age at marriage in all three
social classes in question. However, the rate
of decline is maximum for social class I and

Brief Reports

Social Biology

minimum for social class III, social class II
being in the intermediate position. This
fact of differential rate of decline in variability strengthens the usefulness of the
classification of the urban couples under
examination by socioeconomic class.

We note that the variation in fertility
patterns of the couples, as indicated by the
overall mean interval between social classes,
indicates that the social norm in India
which encourages an early first pregnancy
and founding of a family persists among the
couples examined, irrespective of their
urban way of living and social standing.
Accepting more or less the same inherent
fecundity of the couples originating in different socioeconomic strata, we observe that
the desire for the first birth after commencement of cohabitation in marriage has
actually been translated into fruition within
30 months in a little less than three-fourths
of the couples concerned.

Under the circumstances, one query becomes pressing. What might be the effective
contribution of contraceptive practices, if
adopted at all, to induce the interval of
30 months among the large majority of the
urban couples under examination? To answer this question, we point out for the
present that (1) the single majority (40%)
among all wives of all social classes experienced the interval of 18 months only
and (2) irrespective of social standing and
economic level the average number of
months between effective marriage and first
birth does not fluctuate beyond a low of 24
months and a high of 27 months in general.

The above averages do not, in fact, reveal
certain other data generated by each social
class independently. We observe that in
social class I the wives who had the first
birth within 1.5 years after effective marriage were married in 47% of the cases
below the age of 20. In contrast, in social
class II, 48% of the wives having the first
birth within the same 1.5 years were mar

Vol. 20, No. 1

ried below the age of 18. But for social
class III, it is significant that as high as
59% of the wives who had the first birth
within this 1.5 years were married below
the age of 16. Nevertheless, the most frequently reported interval (the mode) is
only 12 months for each one of the social
classes in question.

With respect to the longest interval (42
and more months), it is observed that the
proportion of wives registering such a time
gap between effective marriage and first
birth increases steadily from higher to
lower social class. It increases from 8%
(class I) to 15% (class III) with 12%
found for class II. Those wives who had
their first births after 3.5 years were
married by the age of 18 in 50% of the
cases within class I, 63% of the cases
within class II, and 95% of the cases
within class III.

Further, the average length of the first
birth interval is maximum among the wives
of class III. In fact, this is the highest value
for the average interval shown in the given
tables, and the length of the first birth
interval is clearly related to the socioeconomic status of the couples concerned.
However, one fact should be stressed here:
the higher the status, the shorter is the
average interval, even though the variability
and the mode are more or less the same
over the given three social classes.

The above characteristics indicate, no
doubt, a clear social class variation in
family-building motives and procreative
actions of the couples under study. How
much are such class differences linked up
with couples’ disposition towards contraceptive methods in the early years of married life? The answer to this query is
available from an excellent study (Poti,
Malaker, and Chakraborti, 1960) which
shows that the reduction in the number of
pregnancies as a result of adoption of birth
control practices is largest in social class

Brief Reports

107

I and least in class III. This differential
might be ascribed to the more effective and
extensive practice of contraception by the
couples of the higher strata. Nonetheless,
we would like to emphasize that couples of
higher social strata (I and II) have a
higher proportion producing a first birth
within 18 months of effective marriage and
the most frequently reported interval is
found to be only 12 months for all social
classes.

When the above trend of early childbearing is found to exist among the given
couples in general, irrespective of social class
we may reasonably assume that given the
background of the prevailing Indian norm
of early marriage and early first pregnancy
the higher status and _ better-educated
couples of Calcutta do not behave significantly differently from their counterparts
living in lower social strata. The validity of
this assumption may be accepted on the
merit of all the essential findings available
from the statistical tables.

While examining the distribution of the
interval between age at marriage and first
birth, we have classified the females in
question by different groups of months of
interval and the resulting figures are presented in Table 4. To minimize biases in
the reporting and to arrive at a smooth

with respect to all white wives (18-39

The three distributions in question are
markedly asymmetrical, more or less to the
same extent. It is noted that for social
class I the percentage starts from as high
as 42% and comes steeply down to as low
as 2%. For social class III, the figure
starts from a high value of 33% (but not
so high compared to class I) and comes

the other hand, social class IT maintains a
typical intermediate position in the true

OBSERVATIONS ON COMPARABLE STUDIES

In the United States, the average number
of months in the first birth interval is 24
for all white wives 18-39 years old. However, two-thirds of the wives with a first
birth had it before they had been married
24 months. In fact, 50% had a first birth
within 15 months after marriage (this is
the median value for the first birth interval). The most frequently reported interval
(i.e., the mode) is even lower—10 months
(Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson,
1966). The first birth interval (average)
as observed for the United States white

Vol. 20, No. 1

wives tallies exactly with what we have obtained for the urban wives of only social
class I, though the mode of interval definitely differs.

In a previous study on Bengali women
(Hindu) of Calcutta (1947-49), the
“upper class” cohorts were shown to have
the shortest average interval between first
cohabitation and first termination of pregnancy (2.3 years to 3.4 yrs) (Chandrasekaran and George, 1962). We find that the
socioeconomic status of this “upper class”
cohort conforms very well with that of the
couples of our social class I, and consequently the feature of shortest average interval is confirmed for the couples of social
class I in our study of Calcutta women
(1956-57). However, it should be pointed
out again that the average number of
months between effective marriage and first
birth was definitely shortened by the couples of social class I as well as class II in
Calcutta by the mid-1950’s.

The phenomenon of declining average
interval noticed among the urban couples
of Calcutta can also be attested for urban
India as a whole. With respect to Hindu
couples (married after 1930), it has been
shown that the average interval was as high
as 53.4 months in urban India (1952), and
there was hardly any disparity between the
intervals for the rural and the urban sectors
of the country (Das Gupta et al., 1955). A
study on couple fertility in India (196162) has recently shown that the average
interval to first birth was 32.38 months
only for couples married after 1941 in the
urban sectors (National Sample Survey,
1967).

In addition to the above, further interesting data on first birth interval from several zonal populations of India are available.
In urban districts of Kolaba and Nasik in
western India, the Fertility Survey (1952—
54) revealed that the average intervals between marriage and first delivery varied

Brief Reports

109

between a high of 5.5 years and a low of
2.5 years in Kolaba and again, between 4.8
years and 3.1 years in Nasik (Sovani and
Dandekar, 1955). For Calcutta (1956-57)
in eastern India we find, in contrast, that
the average intervals between effective marriage and first birth varied between a high
of 2.6 years and a low of 1.9 years among
the ever-married women aged between 16
years or less and 22 years or more at marriage. Registering relatively more months
on the average between marriage and first
delivery, the urban couples of western India
in the 1950’s are noticeably distinct from
their counterparts in eastern India in
family-building motives and actions.

On the other hand, another study on
fertility and age at marriage (Sinha, 1951)
in Lucknow and Kanpur, cities of Uttar
Pradesh, showed that for urban wives the
average interval fluctuated between 5.0
years and 1.7 years, the interval diminishing with increasing age at consummation
of marriage (Lorimer, 1954). The trend in
the first birth interval varied among urban
couples of Uttar Pradesh (1951) in such a
way that it resembled more closely the
trend observed for couples in urban Kolaba
(Maharashtra) than that found in the
present study for urban wives of Calcutta,
West Bengal.

CONCLUSIONS

The above differentials in first birth intervals show the variation in the desire for
early childbearing and early founding of
the family of procreation (Gillin and Gillin,
1945) within the existing complex sociocultural setting of India. The differential
fertility pattern that still prevails in modern Indian families (Kapadia, 1955; Rele,
1963; Pakrasi, 1966) emanates fundamentally from differential ages at marriage and
initial intervals to first birth. Further investigations over wider areas—urban and
rural, and within many more cultural

groups of India—are required to pinpoint
social class trends and differentials in age
at marriage and the first birth interval. The
differences in interval to first birth by
social class revealed in this study present
an interesting issue which needs close sociological examination to spell out the interactions of various sociocultural factors
which might have caused such differences
in the population.

SUMMARY

The average interval between age at effective marriage and first birth varied
within a very short range: 24-25 months
(social class I/II) to 27 months (social
class III) among Calcutta couples in 195657. The standard deviation of mean interval
varied, on the other hand, between 10
months (class I) and 12 months (class IT).
The mode of interval was 12 months only
for all the three social classes under exam

ination. The average interval declined
steadily with increasing age at marriage in
all social classes. The average length of the
first birth interval was maximum within
social class III, although, variability in the
average interval was observed to decline
with increasing age at marriage in all three
social classes.

An examination of the first birth interval
by social class shows clearly that the higher
the status of the couples of Calcutta the
shorter is the average interval. In general,
the higher status and better educated couples of Calcutta evinced a pattern of family
building behavior just after consummation
of marriage which hardly differed significantly from that of their counterparts
living in relatively lower social strata.
