ABSTRACT: This research examines the social, demographic, and family-planning-program factors that influence the occurrence of IUD discontinuation among Chinese women, using a sample
of 14,639 IUD use segments from the 1988 Chinese National Survey of Fertility and Contraceptive Prevalence. A discrete-time competing-risk event history method is employed to identify
the determinants of IUD discontinuation by five kinds of reasons: contraceptive failure, expulsion, switching method, side-effects and other nonmethod-related reasons. The predictors of
IUD discontinuation suggest that a number of mechanisms are in operation. Some of the
determinants may reflect the effects of the family planning program; some may illustrate
women’s physiological and biological reactions to IUD’s; some may be related to women’s
previous history of contraceptive use; and still others may indicate social characteristics of

women that lead them to have their IUD’s removed.

There are about 80 million women
using [UD’s (Intrauterine Devices) for
contraception in the world, of which
60 million live in China (Weinberger,
1991; Kaufman, 1993; Wang et al.,
1996). At present, the IUD is the most
widely used form of contraception in
China, especially in rural areas, and
also one of the main methods rigorously promoted by the national family
planning program. In 1988, IUD’s accounted for around 42 per cent of
contraceptive use (Wang et al., 1996);
in 1992, the contraceptive prevalence
rate reached the historical high at 83
per cent among married women of reproductive age, with users of the IUD
still making up 40 per cent of total users (State Family Planning Commission, 1993). |

IUD use in China was closely associated with family size, according to
the study by Wang et al (1996). Chi
nese women. of reproductive age seldom used IUD’s before their first
child, but nearly half of the women
who have just one child adopted
IUD’s. When women have two or
more children, about half of them
turned to sterilization, whereas only a
quarter of them were still fitted with
IUD’s. The patterns of IUD use clearly
indicate the enforcement of the family
planning program since the current national family planning policy strongly
encourages the insertion of an IUD after the birth of the first child, and sterilization after two or more children.
Although China has the largest
number of IUD users in the world,
there has been evidence that [UD discontinuation rates in China are also
among the highest. Wang et al. (1996)
showed that the first year failure rate
for IUD’s is 10 per cent. This figure is
the second highest after Brazil (13 per

272

cent) among some developing countries selected from Asia, Latin America, and Africa, whereas in developed
countries the first-year failure rate for
IUD’s is only 2 per cent (Moreno and
Goldman, 1991; Hatcher et al., 1992).
Some studies suggest that the high discontinuation rates are related to the
quality of IUD’s manufactured in
China. Almost all YUD’s used in China
are domestically manufactured. The
main IUD produced locally is the stainless steel ring (SSR), which is made in
several sizes (20-23mm). There are
also other domestically designed devices available, including the ‘“‘Mahua”’
ring, the Copper V-200 (also known as
the ‘Shanghai V’’), and others (Xiao,
1989; Kaufman, 1993). One clinical
study by the State Family Planning
Commission of China in 1983-84 in 13
provinces compared three I[UD’s available in China—the SSR, the Copper
T-220, and Copper V-200. The SSR
had a first-year failure rate of 10.6 per
cent, compared with a rate of 1.7 per
cent for the Copper T, and 2.1 per cent
for the Copper V (State Family Planning Commission, 1985). Another clinical study, conducted by Gao et al.
(1986) in 1981-86 in Beijing, found
two-year failure rates of 8 per cent for
the SSR, 2.1 per cent for the Copper V,
and 1 per cent for the Copper T, and
two-year expulsion rates of 12.6 per
cent for the SSR compared with 1.6 per
cent and 1.7 per cent for the Copper V
and the Copper T, respectively. However, a recent study by Tu (1995),
based on data from a_ speciallydesigned retrospective survey in four
counties in North China, showed that
the failure and expulsion rates from his
study are higher for copper IUD’s but
lower for noncopper IUD’s than those

Social Biology

from the clinical studies and so the dif
ference in the failure and expulsion
rates between copper and noncopper
IUD’s is small. He listed three possible
reasons for the small difference between copper and noncopper IUD’s:
(1) poorly performed insertions of copper IUD’s by inadequately trained rural family planning workers at the
township service stations, (2) misidentification of the type of IUD, or by users’ deliberate removal of copper
IUD’s, and (3) their misreporting the
causes of discontinuation.

Low effectiveness and continuation
rates of IUD’s used in China may have
a considerable demographic impact on
the Chinese family planning program.
Wang and Diamond (1995) demonstrated that contraceptive failures contributed 7 per cent to the general fertility among women aged 15-49 in the
1980’s, 72 per cent of which were due
to IUD failures. Induced abortion has
been an important backup method for
the Chinese family planning program,
and about 70 per cent of the estimated
11 million abortions carried out each
year were due to contraceptive, especially IUD failure (Delfs, 1990). Despite its ineffectiveness, the SSR is still
widely used by about 90 per cent of
IUD users (Kaufman, 1993).

Although the studies mentioned
above provide us with some very important information about IUD discontinuation in China, they have been
largely limited to examining the effects
of types or qualities of IUD’s on their
discontinuation based on clinical studies or local studies. Clinical studies
could not provide accurate information
on the effectiveness of the method under real-life situations in China because of the selection biases in subject

recruitment, service quality, etc. Also,
studies of IUD discontinuation patterns and determinants for the whole
nation are rare. Yet little is known
about sociodemographic factors that
lead to the discontinuation of IUD use
due to failure, expulsion, side-effects,
etc. Although Tu’s study (1995) examined the IUD discontinuation patterns
and determinants for the real-life situation of rural China by using a polychotomous logistic regression technique that allows the simultaneous
consideration of IUD discontinuation
determinants, it has several limitations. First, his study was based on data
from just four counties, and the results
can not be generalized for the whole
country. Second, it examined the effects of some individual, household,
and institutional variables only on firstthree-years discontinuation patterns
of IUD removal, pregnancy, and expulsion. We do not know what happens
after three years of IUD use and what
the patterns and correlates are for
other reasons of IUD discontinuation
such as side-effects, switching-method,
and the like. Third, most importantly,
the study used a relatively small sample
of 2,450 IUD use segments, compared
with 14,639 use segments in our study
from which it is expected that more stable estimates and reliable information
could be obtained.

In this paper I study the patterns
and correlates of IUD discontinuation
in a new way. I use a national sample
to identify the sociodemographic and
family-planning-program determinants
of IUD discontinuation by five different reasons (pregnancy, expulsion,
switching method, side-effects, and
other nonmethod-related causes), during the first eight and a half years of

IUD use under real-life situations. I
employ a discrete-time competing risk
model, which has an important methodological advantage over polychotomous logistic regression in that it takes
into account time-dependence of IUD
discontinuation. Failure to control for
the time-dependence may create a serious bias if the discontinuation rates
change dramatically and in different
ways with time during the period
of study. The purposes of this study
are two-fold: (1) to provide detailed information about the relationship between women’s sociodemographic and
family-planning-program factors and
IUD discontinuation, and (2) to understand the mechanisms through which
those factors influence the occurrence
of IUD stopping.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study uses a 10 per cent sample
of data from the National Survey of
Fertility and Contraceptive Prevalence, often called the Two-perThousand Fertility Survey, carried out
by the State Family Planning Commission in 1988. The central elements of
the survey were the pregnancy and
contraceptive-use histories, but data
on characteristics of both husband and
wife, as well as other household members were also gathered. In the complete contraceptive history, a woman
was asked the month and year she had
started contraception for each continuous period of use, the method she had
adopted, the date she had stopped using that method, and the reason she
stopped at that specific time (Lavely,
1991; Chen, 1991).

The sample for analysis of IUD discontinuation is restricted to all IUD
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

274

uses that started from January 1, 1980
(after the introduction of the one-child
policy). The sample therefore has
14,639 segments of IUD uses, contributed by 12,334 women.

There were a total of ten reasons for
stopping IUD use listed in the questionnaire: (1) side-effects, (2) illness,
(3) menopause, (4) switching method,
(5) widowhood or separation or divorce, (6) waiting to have a child with
a license, (7) waiting to have a child
without a license, (8) contraceptive
failure (pregnancy occurring while an
IUD is fitted), (9) other reasons, (10)
expulsion. Table 1 presents the composition of discontinuation by different
reasons for the sample.

For convenience of analysis these
reasons are collapsed into five categories: (1) contraceptive failure (41.0 per
cent), (2) expulsion (20.9 per cent),
(3) switching (17.3 per cent), (4) sideeffects (3.4 per cent), and (5) other
reasons (17.3 per cent). The first four
reasons for stopping are methodrelated whereas the last category is not
method-related. Such a classification
makes it possible to distinguish the determinants of method-related discontinuation from those of person-related
discontinuation.

Four sets of variables that are likely
to influence the occurrence of IUD discontinuation are included in the analysis: socioeconomic, demographic,
contraceptive-use-history, and familyplanning-program variables. The socioeconomic variables in the analysis
are woman’s rural-urban residence
(UR), educational attainment (EDC),
occupation (OCP), ethnicity (ETH),
and geographic region (RG). Demographic variables include the woman’s
age at the start of IUD use (AGE) and

number of living children (NLC). Contraceptive history is indicated by prior
contraceptive use (PU) and failure
(PF), and motivation (MOT). The cohorts of users (COH), or period of use
since or before 1984 is introduced as
a family-planning-program variable to
indicate the change in the one-child
policy since 1984. The definitions of
these variables and their frequency distributions by reason for stopping are
presented in Table 2. The Two-perThousand Fertility Survey did not collect information on types of IUD’s,
making it impossible to check the impact of IUD type on IUD discontinuation. However, a finding from Tu
(1995) suggests that the difference in
the probabilities of removal, pregnancy, and expulsion between the copper and noncopper IUD’s under reallife situations is not statistically
significant when the effects of other
variables are controlled.

IUD discontinuation by different
reasons can be analyzed within the
framework of a competing-risk eventhistory model (Allison, 1982; Yamaguchi, 1991). Either discrete-time or
continuous-time competing-risk methods can be employed. A discrete-time
competing-risk model is used in this
study for the following two reasons.
First, the sample has 14,639 spells of
use. There is therefore the problem of
a large number of tied observations,
which may bias results if continuoustime hazard models are used. The
second reason is that a discrete-time
competing risk model is in fact a multinomial logit model, and therefore it
can be estimated by using a multinomial logit program (Allison, 1982).
When the independent variables are
categorical, estimation of the multi

nomial logit model is most easily accomplished using log-linear modelling
technique (Allison, 1982).

The first step in the procedure for
the analysis of IUD continuation is to
break up each use spell into a set of
discrete time units, with time divided
into intervals of six months. Each sixmonth interval is treated as a separate
observation or unit of analysis. For
each of these observations, the dependent variable, discontinuation of IUD
use, is a polytomy having six categories
(i.e., five events being failure, expulsion, switching, side-effects and nonmethod reasons, and the extra category being nonoccurrence of any of the
five events, i.e., still using IUD or continuation). The explanatory variables
associated with each of these intervals
remain constant as none contains information on change over time. It is important to include in the data file a variable for duration of IUD use because,
like any event history methods, the
competing-risk model needs a time
variable to build its baseline hazard

function. However, duration is introduced as a time-varying variable as
each six-month interval is treated as a
different observation. Pooling across
all the time units, the next step is to
form a contingency table for all the categorical variables. This results in a total of 79,387 observations from 14,639
segments of IUD uses. Table 3 presents the frequencies by cause for stopping and duration of use.

Finally, I fit log-linear models corresponding to logit models for the dependent variable with six response levels. It can be seen from Table 3 that
most cells after 84 months have zero
frequencies. As duration determines
the shape of baseline hazard function
in competing-risk model analysis of
IUD stopping, it 1s necessary to consider collapsing some adjacent duration periods in Table 3 to get stable
estimates of its parameters. When duration periods are collapsed, the number of events and exposure to risk
simply need to be summed across
categories. If adjacent time periods

need to be collapsed, this should be
done after the calculation of units
of analysis (Yamaguchi, 1991). In this
analysis, IUD use-segments after 84
months are combined.

Backward elimination is used to select the best parsimonious main-effects
log-linear model. For the model selection, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used for comparisons
among nonnested models (Raftery,
1986), and the likelihood-ratio chisquare Statistic is used for comparisons
of nested models.

MOoDEL SELECTION

The SAS log-linear procedure CATMOD is used here for the multinomial
logit analysis of IUD discontinuation
(SAS Institute, 1988). Model selection
is carried out in two steps in this study.
The first step is to model the time de
pendence of IUD discontinuation, and
the second step involves a search for
the main-effects model which fits the
data best.

Generally, there are two distinct approaches to modelling time dependence. One approach is parametric,
assuming that the form of time dependence is characterized by a specific
function of time. CATMOD specifies
independent variables that are to be
treated quantitatively (like continuous
or ordinal variables) by a DIRECT
statement, which makes it very convenient to fit the parametric duration
dependence. The second approach to
modelling time dependence is nonparametric. It can be effectively employed for a log-linear model. In this
approach, dummy variables are used
to distinguish a discrete set of time
points or time intervals. Parameters for
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

278

the dummy variables are estimated,
thereby characterizing time dependence without specifying its functional
form.

Here I consider some of the most
commonly used and simplest functions
that can be used to represent the baseline time dependence:

Model 1: log odds, = a, + b, X DR

Model 2: log odds, = a, + b, X DR?

Model 3: log odds, = a,+ b, X DR+
c, X DR?

Model 4: log odds, = a, + b, X log(DR)

Model 5: log odds, = a, + b, X DR +
c, X log(DR)

Model 6: log odds, = a, + b, X DR‘?

Model 7: log odds, = a, + b, X DR +
c, X DR!

Model 8: log odds, = A,P! (D1,
6-month intervals)

Model 9: log odds, = A,P? (D2, 0-5,
6-11, 12-23, 24-35, 36-47, 48+)

Model 10: log odds, = A,P? (D3, 0-5,
6-11, 12-17, 18-31, 32-47, 48+)

where log odds, is the logarithm of the
odds of stopping IUD use for reason
i (i=1, failure; 2, expulsion; 3, switching; 4, side-effects; 5, non-method
related reasons) as opposed to continuing an IUD use. Variable DR represents the linear effect of duration on
log odds of IUD discontinuation. The
variable DR is assigned the value of the
midpoint for each time interval of duration, 1.e., DR = 2.5, 8.5, 14.5,...,
80.5, 90. Note the last period gets a
score of 90, because this time period
represents the combined duration of
84-89, 90-95 and 96+. Of all the specifications, the first seven models are
parametric and the last three models
are nonparametric for the time dependence of IUD discontinuation. The
likelihood ratio statistics and BIC are
presented for each of these models in
Table 4.

Table 4 shows that all models are
statistically significantly better than the
constant model according to the likelihood ratio chi-square statistics. However, we can not judge the relative
goodness-of-fit of those models using
the chi-square statistic because they
are nonnested. Model selection among
nonnested models can be done using
BIC (Raftery, 1986; Yamaguchi,
1991). According to BIC in Table 4,
models that have a two-parameter
characterization for duration dependence fit the data better than nonparametric specification. Among the duration models with two parameters, the
model with a parabolic specification of
duration dependence fits the data best.
However, when the shape of the duration effect is specified net of other variables this way, it may not be fully separated from the effects of the other
variables. To check that this is not the
case, I estimate models with other
significant independent variables included. The results show that this
specification is still the best of ten
duration-dependent models of IUD
discontinuation. So this quadratic
polynomial function of duration of
IUD use is adopted as the baseline
time-dependent form for the analysis.

Table 5 displays the backward elimination process of model selection, beginning with the model with all the
main-effect terms together with the
parabolic duration effect. At each
stage, I delete the term for which the
resulting increase in G? is the smallest.
The first stage deletes UR, though two
other models are nearly as good. Subsequent stages eliminate MOT and
EDC. Further simplifications are not
fruitful, and M6 is the simplest maineffects model to fit adequately. All the

RESULTS

This section presents the interpretation of the parameter estimates from
the final parsimonious main-effects
multinomial logit model for IUD discontinuation. The results of the multinomial logit model are presented in
Table 6. Coefficients, as well as their
statistical significance for individual
parameters for each type of stopping,
are presented in the first five columns,
each providing a contrast between discontinuation due to a specific reason
and continuation (the reference category). The remaining columns provide
the chi-square test of each variable effect (Wald test), which is similar to
analysis of variance for the leastsquares analysis.

It can be seen from Table 6 that the
number of living children and age at
the start of IUD insertion are the most
important determinants of IUD discontinuation, with the large differences in the logit coefficients among
their categories and the big average
chi-square statistics per degree of freedom being 76.69 and 48.34, respectively. The period of use has the third
strongest effect on IUD stopping.
Compared with these three variables,
other variables contribute relatively little to discontinuing an IUD use.

The logit coefficients can be converted into the odds of discontinuation
and can be interpreted as follows: For
the effect of period of use on IUD failure, when the effects of other covariates are controlled, the odds of having
an IUD failure are 1.39( =exp(0.1637)/
exp(-—0.1637)) times higher for women

who started IUD use before 1984 than
for women who started IUD use since
1984,

In the discussion below, the effects
of these variables on each reason for
stopping are examined in more detail,
beginning with an assessment of differentials in the discontinuation rates by
duration, period of use, and region. It
should be mentioned here that because
this study uses a quite different method
and different sets of variables from
those used in Tu’s study (1985) it is not
feasible to make direct comparison of
the results from the two studies, although both studies address the same
topic.

EFFECTS OF DURATION, PERIOD OF
UsE, AND REGION

Table 6 shows that duration of IUD
use, period of use, and geographic region are the only variables that have
statistically significant influences on
each type of IUD discontinuation.
Therefore I discuss the effects of these
variables before making separate analyses of reason-specific discontinuation.
To illustrate the effects of duration on
the likelihood of stopping IUD use,
Figure 1 shows the predicted (standardized) probabilities of discontinuing an IUD use calculated by holding
all other variables constant at their averages. Different patterns emerge for
different reasons of discontinuation.
IUD failure is at its peak during the
first year of use and declines steadily
afterwards. Similarly, the probability
of expulsion is highest in the first year
after insertion and decreases until four
years of use, then remains almost unchanged afterwards. For stopping due
to changing method, the probability remains at above 0.5 per cent during the

first four years of use and then drops to
below 0.5 per cent during the following
years of use. The probability for nonmethod reasons has an increasing trend
with duration of use in the first fourand-a-half years of use. Side-effects are
the least likely reason for stopping use
and are more likely to occur during the
first six months after insertion and to
remain constant after six months,
which is consistent with clinical studies
(Treiman and Liskin, 1988; Hatcher et
al., 1992).

During the first year of use, contra
-ceptive failure is the most important

reason to discontinue use of an IUD,
followed by expulsion, switching
method, nonmethod reasons, and sideeffects. The relative importance to
stopping IUD use by cause changes
during the time period of IUD use. After four years of use, nonmethod reasons replace contraceptive failure as
the most important reason, with the

probability of discontinuing an IUD
caused by other reasons (except for
contraceptive failure) being almost
constant and at relatively low levels.

According to Table 6, region (RG)
and period of use (COH) are found
to have universally significant effects
on types of discontinuation: failure,
expulsion, switching, side-effects and
nonmethod-related stopping.

The descriptive statistics in Table 2
show that there appears to be a strong
cohort effect on the likelihood that a
woman will stop IUD use, with higher
rates of discontinuation reported in the
pre-1984 period. However, this finding
may possibly be caused by the selection
biases as those starting their I[UD’s use
after 1983 have a shorter exposure time
and most of them are censored at the
time of the survey. After the possible
selection biases due to differences in
exposure have been removed by controlling for the duration of IUD use in

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

the model, the strong cohort effect on
IUD discontinuation by all reasons is
confirmed. The results from Table 6 indicate that the log-odds are stopping
IUD use due to failure, expulsion, and
side-effects among women who initiated use since 1984 are much lower
than among those who started use before 1984. For IUD users, the largest
reduction in IUD discontinuation rate
since 1984 compared with the earlier
pre-1984 period is due to switching an
IUD to another method; the next most
important reasons are side-effects, expulsion, failure, and then nonmethodrelated reasons. The odds of discontinuing an IUD use due to those
reasons are, respectively, 1.81, 1.67,
1.49, 1.39 and 1.21 times higher for
women initiating IUD use before 1984
than since 1984.

The reason for this decline in discontinuation rates may perhaps be the
promotion of the family planning
services. Another possible explanation
may be the relaxation of the family
planning program after 1983. Greenhalgh (1986) documented that the Chinese government has eased enforcement of the one-child policy slightly
(referring to its action as “‘opening a
small hole” in 1984). This policy of leniency, when it happens, is likely to affect contraceptive behavior. For example, users may be more motivated to
use an IUD so the discontinuation rate
is lower.

Regional differentials in IUD discontinuation rates (Table 6) are expected. China can be described as a
mosaic of different cultures. It has an
area of 9.6 million square-kilometers
and 31 administrative regions, with
each region having its own cultural and
geographic characteristics. Also, there

IUD in China

283

is diversity in fertility patterns and
family planning programs (Peng, 1991;
Anderson and Silver, 1995). To simplify the presentation, the 29 regions
included in the sample have been
grouped into six large areas: North,
Northeast, East, South, Southwest,
and Northwest. This grouping, based
on the geographic criterion, is somewhat arbitrary. It may conceal internal
differences in terms of economic, environmental, and cultural heritage, but
it still has captured some regional variability.

Contraceptive failure and switching
rates are the lowest in the Northwest
region, which has the lowest IUD use
rate and a fairly large proportion of
minorities. It is also observed that
the probabilities of discontinuation
caused by expulsion, side-effects, and
nonmethod-related reasons are significantly the lowest in the Northeast,
which has the highest IUD use rate and
the most effective family planning program (Wang et al., 1996; Peng, 1991).

FAILURE

In addition to geographic region and
period of use, age at starting an IUD
use, number of living children, and
previous failure are found to have a
statistically significant impact on IUD
failure (Table 6).

Age at the initiation of IUD use
seems to be the most important determinant of IUD failure, with young
women having a significantly higher
likelihood of IUD failure. For example, the odds of experiencing an IUD
failure for women aged below 24 is 4.87
times as high as that for women aged 30
and over. This finding is not surprising
since women’s fecundity decreases with
age, and also advancing age probably

 

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

284

strengthens women’s motivation to use
an IUD effectively and to terminate
childbearing (Vaughan et al., 1977).

The effects of number of living children and occupation reveal that
women with two children or more, and
those engaged in agricultural work,
have a higher rate of IUD failure than
their counterparts. In China, some
women, especially multiparous mothers in rural areas, may have their
IUD’s removed privately and get pregnant intentionally, but report the pregnancy as a method failure, and then
have a birth without incurring a penalty from the government.

Prior experience of contraceptive
failure strongly increases the chance of
experiencing another accidental pregnancy. Those women may perhaps be
more sexually active or more fecund
and may have experienced repeated
contraceptive failures (Wang et al.,
1996).

EXPULSION

IUD characteristics, such as size,
shape, and quality, may contribute to
differences in the expulsion rate for
different IUD’s. The expulsion rate
may also depend on a number of administrative, patient, and medical variables, including ease of insertion,
clinical experience, and the user’s access to medical services. In addition,
user characteristics, such as age, parity, and occupation, etc., may also explain differences in expulsion rates.

All the explanatory variables that
are included in the parsimonious
model are shown to be strongly associated with IUD expulsion. According
to Table 6, age at the start of IUD insertion has the strongest effect on IUD
expulsion. The odds of expelling an

 

Wang

Social Biology

IUD for women in the youngest age
group is 6.36 times as great as for
women in the oldest age group. This
finding suggests a physiological reaction of women to IUD’s. The uterus of
younger women may be more sensitive
to foreign objects so that the IUD expulsion rate is higher for younger
women (Hatcher et al., 1992).

The number of living children is the
second most important determinant of
IUD expulsion. The coefficients of
number of living children in Table 6 indicate the women with three or more
children have significantly higher odds
of 3.74 to expel IUD’s than women
with two or less children. The effects of
number of living children may reflect
the discontent with the family planning
policy. It is possible that reported expulsions are user-initiated removals
because some women may have a
strong desire for another child and may
have their IUD’s removed and misreport the causes of discontinuation.

Occupation is clearly social in origin. As Table 6 shows, occupation significantly affects the log-odds of expulsion. Women engaged in agricultural
work are more likely than women in
other occupations to have their [UD’s
expelled since they are engaged in
heavy labor and enjoy less favorable
medical and family planning services.
Village rural doctors usually receive
less training and may have limited supplies of different types and sizes of
IUD’s, which may lead to higher rates
of IUD expulsion.

Minority women are less likely to
expel their IUD’s than Han majority
women. Minority women enjoy a lenient family planning policy, and so
IUD users are probably those who
are highly motivated to use it effecDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

tively. They may also have less need to
call a removal an expulsion since expulsion requires no further explanation
whereas removal does.

The effect of previous use indicates
that women with an experience of
contraception have an elevated logodds of having an expulsion. However,
women with experience of failure have
a lower log-odds to expel. The reasons
for these results are unclear.

SWITCHING METHODS

Changing from an IUD to another
method may denote women’s dissatisfaction with the characteristics
of IUD’s, such as use-effectiveness,
health effects, and level of convenience. It may also indicate the enforcement of the family planning
policy.

Age at the start of IUD fitting, number of siblings, previous experience of
contraceptive use, and occupation and
ethnicity significantly affect the propensity to switch from an IUD to another method.

The coefficients of age indicate that
women in age group 27-29 have the
highest log-odds of switching. This result may suggest that women in this
group use an IUD for spacing their
births.

The size of the family of a Chinese
woman might influence her decision to
change method from an IUD to a more
effective method like sterilization.
High-parity women are urged or pressured by the family planning personnel
to adopt highly effective methods to
avoid having additional children. The
results in Table 6 provide clear evidence that family size is the most important factor in IUD switching.

IUD in China

 

 

285

Women with more children are more
likely to change method. The multinomial logit model shows that the odds
of removing an IUD to use another
method are 8.31 and 9.34 times higher
for women with two children and with
at least three children, respectively,
than for women with one child. As reported earlier in this paper, less than
one-fourth of women with two or more
children used IUD’s compared with
more than half who used sterilization
(Wang et al., 1996).

Women who have used contraception previously are more likely to
change method than women without
any experience of use. This group of
women may be more knowledgeable
about contraceptive methods. They
may have changed from IUD’s to other
reversible methods. The occupation
effects show that agricultural women
are clearly more likely than other
women to change to some other
method, probably sterilization, suggesting that women in agricultural
work use an IUD for birth spacing
whereas women in other occupations
use IUD’s for preventing additional
pregnancies. The differentials in the
log-odds of changing methods for the
ethnic minorities demonstrate that minority women are less likely to change
IUD use. The possible explanation is
that national minorities enjoy a more
lenient family planning program, so
they may face less pressure to change
to sterilization than do Han majority
women.

SIDE-EFFECTS

Another variable, age at the start of
IUD fitting, is found to influence significantly the removal of IUD’s because of side-effects.
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

286

The age effect on IUD removal because of side-effects may illustrate
women’s physiological reactions to
IUD’s. This study shows that women
aged between 27 and 29 have the lowest odds of removing an IUD due to
side-effects and that most IUD removals due to side-effects occur during
the first six months (see Figure 1).
This finding partially echoes the clinical reports of an elevated risk of infection only during the first four months
after insertion (Hatcher et al., 1992;
Treiman and Liskin, 1988). Some clinical studies also report high rates of
IUD removal because of bleeding and
pain among both nulliparous and
younger women (Hatcher et al., 1992;
Treiman and Liskin, 1988). Our analysis reveals no parity effect and the
signs of coefficients of age show that
women younger than 27 have a slightly
higher removal rate as a result of sideeffects, but these results are not significant.

NONMETHOD REASONS

Nonmethod reasons represent those
reasons other than expulsion, failure,
side-effects, and switching. Sixty-two
per cent of IUD stopping is attributed
to women’s desire to have a child.
Apart from region and period of use,
two other variables—age at the start of
IUD fitting and number of siblings—
are found to be strongly associated
with the probability of IUD removal
for nonmethod-related reasons.

An inverse relationship between
age and the rate of abandoning method
is found in Table 6. The odds of women
in the youngest age group (23 or less)
having their [UD’s removed are 3.15
times the odds for women in the highest age group (30 or over). This finding

may suggest that younger women use
IUD’s for spacing whereas older
women use IUD’s for preventing the
births of additional children.

A positive relationship between
number of siblings and method abandonment due to nonmethod-related
reasons is found in the analysis.
Women with one or no child have the
lowest log-odds of stopping IUD use,
suggesting that the nulliparous or
single-child women may be those urban women who use an IUD for preventing pregnancy, whereas multiparous women may be those rural women
who use an IUD for spacing.

SUMMARY
AND CONCLUSIONS

In this study a _ discrete-time
competing-risk event history method is
used to identify the determinants of
five types of IUD discontinuation: failure, expulsion, switching, side-effects,
and nonmethod-related reasons. Since
the discrete-time competing risk model
is equivalent to a multinomial logit
model, and since the independent variables included in this study are categorical, the log-linear modelling technique
is used for model selection and parameter estimation. The details of modelling, the duration dependence of IUD
discontinuation, and selection of the
most parsimonious main-effects loglinear model are presented.

Based on the parsimonious multinomial logit model, IUD discontinuation
determinants by cause are identified
and discussed in the study. The determinants of IUD discontinuation suggest that there are several different
mechanisms through which the covariates included in the analysis may influ

ence the likelihood of IUD discontinuation. Some of the covariates may
reflect the effect of the family planning
program; some may illustrate women’s
physiological reactions to IUD; some
may reflect contraceptive-use history;
others reflect the social characteristics
of women that lead them to have their
IUD’s removed for a specific reason.
The first type of predictors may reflect the effect of the family planning
program on IUD discontinuation. The
most obvious example is the effect of
period of use. IUD discontinuation
rates for all reasons including methodrelated and nonmethod-related reasons, declined dramatically among
women who initiated IUD use since
1984 compared with those before 1984.
The Chinese government has been
working hard to promote the family
planning services in the 1980’s and

more reliable types of IUD’s were in- —

troduced in the 1980’s (Kaufman,
1993). The effect of region provides a
second example of the family planning
program effect. The Northeast region,
which includes Liaoning, Jilin, and
Heilungjiang, has a more effective
family planning program than other regions, and has the lowest removal rates
due to expulsion, side-effects, and
nonmethod-related reasons. The determinants of IUD removal to switch
to another method show further evidence of the influence of the family
planning program on IUD discontinuance. The results show that women
with more children are more likely to
change to another method, most likely
sterilization because the family planning program urges multiparous

women to use sterilization.
Some other reasons for IUD discontinuation may also be essentially re
IUD in China

lated to the family planning program.
First, there is ‘clear evidence of a defiance of, and resistance to, the family
planning program policy by some
groups of women. The fact that women
with more children are more likely to
experience a contraceptive failure, to
expel an IUD, and to remove an IUD
to have another child are such examples. A higher expulsion rate among
multiparous women may be attributed
to removing an IUD deliberately because they want to have another child.
They may also have their IUD’s removed intentionally and then get pregnant but report it as a contraceptive
failure. The removal of an IUD to get
pregnant for multiparous women is
clear evidence of resistance to the onechild policy. Secondly, the results in
this study show that women have a
lower [UD discontinuation rate when
they enjoy a relaxed family planning
policy. Ethnic minority women have
enjoyed a lenient family planning policy, and they have lower IUD expulsion and switching rates compared with
Han majority women who face a rather
strict family planning policy. Also, users who started their IUD use after
1984 (which was a period of relaxation
of the one-child policy) had significantly lower rates of IUD discontinuation for the five reasons studied than
those who started their [UD’s in the
earlier strict period. These results may
indicate the negative effects of the Chinese family planning program.

The second type of correlates may
reflect the action of physiological effects on stopping IUD use. Younger
women have higher removal rates due
to IUD failure and expulsion. Younger
women are certainly more fecund and
may be more sexually active than older

women; the uterine cavities of younger
women may be more sensitive to foreign objects so that they have a higher
expulsion rate. Besides, young women
are more likely to have their IUD’s removed within the first year of use because of side-effects of IUD use.

The third category of predictors
may be related to the history of women’s contraceptive use. Women with
previous experience of contraceptive
failure have a higher probability of
having another contraceptive failure,
suggesting that contraceptive failure
may occur frequently among some
women. In addition, women with previous use of reversible methods are
more likely to change from use of the
IUD to other methods.

Social Biology

The last predictor, occupation, is a
social factor. Women in agricultural
work are more likely than women in
other occupations to expel their IUD’s
because they are engaged in heavy labor, receive less favorable family planning services, and have limited supplies
of different types and sizes of IUD’s.
