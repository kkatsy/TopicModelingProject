ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether air pollution in the Los Angeles
Basin is affecting birth weight. The data base for the study consisted of daily air pollutant averages
from the Air Pollution Control] District of Los Angeles County, California, obstetric records of
births at the University of Califoria at Los Angeles Hospital for the year 1973, and smoking
information on each gravida. The effect of totdl pollution level was significantly negatively
associated with birth weight after removing the effects of other variables significantly associated
with birth weight. Infants born to nonsmoking women who lived in the more polluted areas of the
city weigh an average of 314 grams less than infants born to women living in the less polluted areas.

The constituents of polluted air occur
naturally in small quantities in nonpolluted air and are not harmful. Moderate to
heavy levels of air pollution affect the
health of biological organisms, decrease
property values, and generally make daily
life less comfortable. High concentrations
of most pollutants are toxic.

Studies of the effects of moderate levels
of these substances recorded in polluted
air have focused on direct health effects
such as respiratory illnesses, mortality,
hospital admissions, etc. Recent evidence
indicates that the correlation between air
pollution and mortality is significant (Lave
and Seskin, 1970; Kitagawa and Hauser,
1973). The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether air pollution levels are
correlated with a reduction of birth
weight, which is one measure of the
maturity of a neonate and is predictive of a
neonate’s relative probability of survival
(Karn and Penrose, 1951; Yerushalmy, 1970;
Armstrong, 1972).

* Present address: World Fertility Survey, International Statistical Institute, 35-37 Grosvenor Gardens, London, SW1W OBS, U. K.

The proposition to be tested is that infants born to women who live in polluted
urban environments weigh less than infants born to women who live in nonpolluted urban environments. This hypothesis is already supported by several observations:

1. Women who smoke one pack of cigarettes
a day have infants who weigh 100-300
grams less than nonsmoking mothers (Rush
and Kass, 1972).

2. Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels from
6 to 10 per cent measured on women who are
smoking one pack of cigarettes a day are
thought to be the primary causal components
in the observed weight reduction of infants
born to these women (Younoszai et al., 1968;
Longo, 1976).

3. Carbon monoxide levels of 300 parts per
million are often recorded in the Los Angeles
Basin (APCD Annual Report, 1972). These
levels and durations of CO in ambient air
produce COHb levels equal to those recorded on persons smoking one pack of
cigarettes a day. In addition, persons living
in Los Angeles have been observed to have
significant COHb concentrations in their
blood (Stewart et al., 1973).

4. The reproductive success of experimental
animals has been impaired in atmospheres
containing not only CO, but also NOz2 and
Qs at levels simulating those recorded in the
Los Angeles Basin (Hueter et al., 1966;
Lewis et al., 1967).

5. Human neonatal, infant, and adult mortality rates are higher in urban polluted atmospheres than in nonpolluted atmospheres
(Lave and Seskin, 1970; Kitagawa and
Hauser, 1973).

6. Median birth weights are inversely related to population density, but this reduction in weight has not yet been directly correen) with elevated pollution levels (Unger,
1957).

The region from which the data were
obtained to test this proposition was the
Los Angeles Basin, California. Because of
the combination of meteorology, geographic location, climate, sunlight, and
heavy automobile traffic, the Los Angeles
Basin has been plagued by air pollution.
Air pollution zones, each monitored by a
recording station, have been established,
and elevated levels of carbon monoxide
(CO), nitrogen dioxide (NOz), and ozone
(O3) which are known to be toxic are often
recorded (APCD Annual Report, 1972).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data were derived principally from
three sources. The first source was the
hospital records from the University of
California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology
and UCLA Department of Medical Records of all births for the calendar year
1973. Each record contained over a
hundred measured characteristics such as
age, parity, antenatal care information,
delivery complications (if any), past history of illness, etc., on the gravida and her
infant.

The second major source of data was
the daily readings from the Air Pollution
Control District (APCD) of Los Angeles
County. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen
dioxide, and ozone readings were collected
from Stations 1, 69, 71, 74, 76, and 83
because these are the areas from which
UCLA draws the greatest proportion of its
hospital population (Figure 1). Daily averages, computed from the 24 hourly means,

Social Biology

were extracted from the records beginning
April 1, 1973 through December 31, 1973,
and nine-month and three-month moving
averages of each pollutant for each monitoring station were computed.

Each woman in the study was assigned
the station number of the nearest air pollution monitoring station to her residence.
The averages were then incorporated into
each woman’s record such that the ninemonth average covered the gestation
period and the three-month averages specified the mean level for each trimester of
the pregnancy.

The third major source of data was
smoking information. A systematic sample
of 1,500 gravidae was selected, and letters
explaining the research were sent to these
women. The women were requested to
complete and mail a postcard which contained two questions on smoking habits
during their most recent pregnancy. The
first question was whether a gravida had
smoked; the second requested the number
of cigarettes per day, if she had smoked.

Five hundred thirty-three women recelved their letters and responded (henceforth, these are called the respondents).
Six hundred twenty-nine women apparently received their letters but did not respond (henceforth, these are called the
nonrespondents). Three hundred thirtyeight women did not receive their letters,
which were returned marked “addressee
unknown” or “fictitious address.” These
women were not analyzed further since
the study design required that women reside in Los Angeles throughout their
pregnancies, and these women were probably transients.

The combination of these three data
sources (air pollution averages, hospital
records, and smoking history) provided
the data base for this study.

Respondents and nonrespondents were
found to be virtually identical with respect
to all of the measured characteristics. Ref

details of the characteristics of both
groups. Methods and results are specified
only for nonsmoking respondents, unless
otherwise stated, since in their case the air
pollution effects are seen directly.

RESULTS

Since monitoring zones are characterized by different pollution levels, the
gravidae were grouped by monitoring zone
of residence. Analysis of variance (Dixon
and Massey, 1969; Dunn and Clark, 1974)
revealed a significant difference in mean
birth weight among zones. The mean birth
weights of infants born to nonsmoking respondents are shown in Table 1 by moni

not exposed to average pollution levels halfway between the two groups

similar annual pollution levels. (The basis
for this grouping will be detailed later.)
The birth weight differences between
heavy and light pollution areas and between intermediate and light pollution
areas is significant, and the trend is in the
hypothesized direction for nonsmoking respondents as well as for nonsmoking respondents pooled with nonrespondents
(see Table 3). For infants of nonsmoking

respondents, there is a 237 gram difference, which is significant. The difference
for infants of nonrespondents alone is 177
grams.

Given these statistical findings, it was
necessary to determine whether the observed differences and trend were due to
differences in pollution level or to some
other factor. The factors to be determined
were conceptually divided into: (1) variables external to the infant, e.g., the pol

tively more internal, e.g., maternal vari
ables such as age, parity, etc.; and (3)

variables internal to the infant, e.g., gestation length, sex, birth weight.
EXTERNAL VARIABLES

Several modes of interaction between
pollution constituents or concentrations
and birth weight were hypothesized because of the complex chemical and temporal nature of pollutants. These hypotheses included that one, several, or all of the
pollutants affect birth weight during one
or more trimesters, or the effects were
limited to particular seasons of the year
irrespective of the particular trimester of
the fetus.

Data from the nonsmoking respondents
were tested by stepwise regression for the
relationship between each of the pollutants, CO, NQOz, and O3, and birth weight
of the infants (Dixon and Massey, 1969;
Dunn and Clark, 1974). When the ninemonth average pollution levels were employed, only CO had a statistically significant negative regression coefficient,
which accounted for 1 per cent of the total
variance of birth weight. When the data
were analyzed using the averages for each
trimester, all three pollutants had a significant negative regression coefficient
and, summed, they accounted for 3 per
cent of the variance.

All three pollutants were tested for the
effect of seasonal variation in their concentrations. Regression analysis failed to reveal any relationship between seasonal
fluctuations in pollution concentrations
and birth weight. Also, when respondents’
infants were divided into four groups by
season of birth, mean birth weights among
groups did not vary, validating the lack of
seasonal effect on birth weight.

INTERMEDIATE VARIABLES AND INTERNAL
VARIABLES

The three pollutants were combined
and the total averaged over twelve months

for each monitoring station so that a measure expressing relative differences in
levels of total pollution among monitoring
zones could be specified. This pollution
level variable is included with the analysis
of the intermediate and internal variables.
The average for the monitoring station
with the highest annual level in this sample, Station 83, was set to Level 10, and
each lesser station assigned the relative
proportion compared to 83, times 10, so
that the range was index values from 1 to
10. The women residing in areas on the
periphery of Los Angeles were classified as
having exposure to negligible amounts of
pollution and served as the control group.
These annual averages, referred to as total
pollution level, plus the relative pollution
concentration of the stations are listed in
Table 4.

Of the 121 intermediate and internal
variables recorded for each gravida and
her infant, only nine were found to be
significantly associated with birth weight
of the infant. These variables, along with
total pollution level, are listed in the matrix of simple correlations shown in Table

status of the gravida. Patients were divided

in a study such as this. First, a major
problem is the possibility of overlooking
variables that may be contributing to the
observed effect. A second problem related
to the first is that this is a retrospective

DISCUSSION

The results reported above show that
there is a reduction in birth weight due to
the total level of pollution to which the
gravida is exposed and that this reduction
is independent of the effects of other variables tested.

Final interpretation of this result must
include a consideration of three difficulties

effect, so the selected sample is small and
is further reduced because relatively few
women responded to the questionnaire.
And, third, although the birth records
from UCLA were randomly selected,
perhaps women who deliver at UCLA are
not a random sample of all those who deliver in Los Angeles. A discussion of these
three problem areas follows:

UNMEASURED VARIABLES

It seems evident that only the measured
variables in this population are making
major contributions to the observed effect.
Ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and level
of antenatal care are the three most important variables related to residence and
therefore to exposure to pollution.

The ethnic composition of this population was 39 per cent white, 51 per cent
Spanish American, and about 4.5 per
cent, each, Oriental and Black gravidae.
Birth weight is not significantly different
among ethnic groups, and whites and
Spanish Americans reside in all the monitoring zones. Neither of these two factors
accounts for the mean difference (Williams, 1975).

Socioeconomic status is measured by the
patient class, available from hospital records. While this may be an inadequate
measure of socioeconomic status, the impact is minimized because 80 per cent of
the sample are clinic patients. They come
from all monitoring station areas, and
therefore socioeconomic status is relatively
homogeneous and in effect controls for
socioeconomic status across station areas.
This distribution in the sample meant,
however, that we could not adequately
assess a possible interrelation between socloeconomic status and pollution level.

The level of antenatal care significantly
differentiates birth weight in this sample,
but it does not correlate with residence
and so it is not contributing to the differences in birth weight among areas of residence.

SMALL SAMPLE

The sample size is limited because so
few women responded to the smoking survey. However, combining respondents
with nonrespondents increases sample size
and does not alter the findings.

 

 

Social Biology

RANDOM SAMPLE

The effect in terms of a woman’s choice
of hospital must be considered, since
UCLA is one of the major teaching hospitals in the area and attracts women at risk
in terms of low birth weight offspring or
other health problems. One might expect
women from areas farther from UCLA to
deliver infants of lower birth weight.
However, the study population is a
healthy one by recognized medical criteria
(Williams, 1975). The sample does indeed
seem to be random on several levels.

Given the limitations on sample size and
design of the investigation, the observed
effect is most certainly due to differences
in total pollution levels among the monitoring zones of the Los Angeles Basin. The
difference of 314 grams between heavy
and light pollution areas is equivalent to
the effect of one pack of cigarettes a day in
a smoking gravida and indicates that air
pollution may be of significance in the retardation of fetal growth.

IMPLICATIONS

The birth weight is predictive of that
infant’s probability of survival; lower
birth weights are associated with higher
infant mortality rates. Any factor that contributes to a reduction in birth weight is of
concern because of the predictable relationship of birth weight to mortality. Specifically, the reported infant mortality rates
increase from 6.86/1,000 for the 3.501~
4.000 kg birth weight class to 8.85/1,000
for the lighter 3.000-3.500 kg class, for
U.S. whites (Armstrong, 1972). Assuming
a linear relationship between birth weight
and mortality, the 500 gram difference between these two classes leads to a 29 per
cent increase in mortality. The 314 gram
reduction in birth weight attributed to pollution is about three-fifths as great and
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 24, No. 1

predictably could lead to a 17 per cent
increase in infant mortality.

This estimate of increased mortality is
conservative since the data are for U.S.
whites who tend to be of higher socioeconomic status and to live in less polluted
areas of the cities than nonwhites. A decrement of 314 grams in the nonwhite
groups could be associated with an even
greater loss of life if there is an additive or
synergistic effect of lower socioeconomic
class and pollution. In addition, the monitoring zones included in this study are not
the most polluted zones in the Los Angeles
Basin, and there may be even more of a
reduction in weight associated with
heavier pollution levels.

Until now, the health effects known to
be associated with pollution are increases
in respiratory illnesses and in adult mortality rates. Since adult mortality comes
after childbearing age, there is presumably
no selection pressure from _ pollution.

Air Pollution and Birth Weight . 9

However, if pollution is causing a reduction in birth weight, then there is evidence
of pollution as an agent of selection; and
certain subpopulations living in the less
desirable parts of urban centers may suffer
relatively more intensive selection due to
