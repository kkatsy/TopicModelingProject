A Monte Carlo Model for the Study
of Human Fertility under Varying

Fecundability

K. Venkatacharya

International Institute for Population Studies
Deonar, Bombay

Fertility is one of the complex phenomena that affect population change. In
an attempt to understand this phenomenon
more clearly, various efforts have been
made through sophisticated _ statistical
techniques (Perrin and Sheps, 1964). Recently computer facilities have been exploited to make the studies more realistic,
through increasing the complexity of the
models. For example, the Ridley-Sheps
(1966) micro-simulation model takes into
account marriage probabilities, conception
probabilities by age, and a number of
other biological parameters to simulate
births. In this model, fecundability (i.e.,
the monthly probability of conception,
given that a woman is currently susceptible
to risk of conception) is assumed to vary
by age, but women of the same age have
the same fecundability. Later Sheps and
her associates (1966) introduced the heterogeneity in fecundability among women
of the same age. They first chose a uniform
pattern of variation of fecundability with
the same coefficient of variation among
women from one age to the next.

In the present paper a slightly different
and probably a more general approach is
used to take into account the variation of

 

fecundability in two directions: (1) between different ages of the same women
and (2) among different women of the
same age. One of the purposes of the
present paper is to make an attempt to
define fecundability as a function of some
relevant biological variables which will
yield reasonable fertility rates for India,
and indicate methods of estimating them
from observed data.

Henry (1965) has stated that the curve
of fecundability follows a specific pattern
(shown in Figure 1), when the population
does not practice contraception.

It can be observed that this pattern may
be true in most of the noncontracepting
countries, except for small variations in
the parameters of the curve, which are
dependent upon the socioeconomic and
cultural patterns of the population in
question. The fact that fecundability is
not a directly measurable quantity makes
it difficult to verify the above pattern in
any particular real population. However,
it is possible to verify roughly whether
the above pattern is true in any specific
situation by working through a model
(Monte Carlo or Expected Values) where
observed values of all other parameters

Fic. 1.—Curve of fecundability in a population not practicing contraception: a, earliest age at which
fecundability is zero (but assumes positive values immediately after this age); 5, the age at which
fecundability attains a maximum value (e) (remaining constant or decreasing slowly for a period beyond this age); c, the age at which fecundability starts decreasing (or decreasing faster); d, the
terminal age from and after which fecundability is zero.

and assumed values of fecundability are
used as input, and the resultant fertility
variables, such as mean number of live
births, age-specific marital fertility rate,
and intervals between births of various
orders are analyzed through statistical
methods. If the end results of the model
agree with the observed ones, there will
be enough indirect evidence to believe that
the assumed pattern could be correct.

This equation is similar to one given by
Lah (1958) for fertility rather than fecundability. This equation has been chosen
to describe fecundability because of its
flexibility in fitting various fertility curves
and secondly for the presumed ease with
which the parameters can be interpreted.

IMPACT OF VARIATIONS IN @, J, e,
AND d ON FERTILITY

It can be easily shown by differentiating
f(x) with respect to a, that f(x) increases
as a decreases and vice versa, but the
mapnitude of variation is largest when x
is less than b. Similarly it can be shown
that f(x) increases or decreases as d in
In this paper, consideration will be given
to only four parameters, a, 5, e, and d,
while the parameter c will in effect be
treated as coincident with b so that the
plateau assumed by Henry between & and
c will be assumed nonexistent. It has been
assumed that the four parameters are
independent, The fecundability curve f(x)
will be defined in terms of these parameters
as follows:

creases or decreases, and here the magnitude of variation is large when x is greater
than J. Also a given amount of change in
a produces greater effect on f(x) than an
equal amount of change in d. An increase
in & increases f(x) when x is greater than
b and decreases it when «x is less than 6.

ESTIMATION OF VARIOUS PARAMETERS
OF FECUNDABILITY

The parameter a is the initial age up to
which fecundability is zero and after which
age fecundability assumes nonzero values
that increase gradually with age. One can
consider the distribution of the age at
menarche as the input for a. However, it
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

408

is not clear whether fecundability is zero
at menarche (or a little later due to anovulation) and then gradually increases, or
whether it starts with some small positive
value and then gradually rises.

It may be noted that the assumed form
of f(x) to some extent takes care of

‘ adolescent sterility which sometimes may

delay onset of fecundity (Talwar, 1965).
Various studies made in India on menarche
give a mean age of 13.5 years (Ministry
of Health, Govt. of India, 1964). The
distribution of menarche used for this
study is shown in Table 1.

For parameter d, the age at which
fecundability ultimately vanishes, a similar
problem arises. From available knowledge
it is believed that fecundability ceases
after menopause or earlier due to secondary sterility. But whether fecundability
gradually decreases and vanishes exactly

Venkatacharya

Social Biology

at menopause or vanishes abruptly is not
known. The results of the present paper
seem to indicate that fecundability does
not gradually decrease and vanish at
menopause. Accepting any distribution of
Menopause and assuming that fecundability gradually vanishes with menopause
it appeared impossible to reproduce agespecific marital fertility rates for age
group 40-44 of 69 per 1,000 married
women consistent with the age-specific
marital fertility rates for earlier age groups.
The initial input for d (distribution A in
Table 2) was based upon the data of a
sample of Indian women given by Saxena
(1965) in Table 2. The data are supposed
to reflect both menopause and secondary
sterility. When these data are found (in
the following section) to be on the low
side, a distribution (B) of menopause
observed by Dandekar (1959) has been
used which is also shown in Table 2. As
will be evident from the latter part of
the paper this distribution too appears to
be inadequate, because the assumed function for fecundability takes care of secondary sterility to some extent. In addition, a number of variations on the Saxena
data are also made to obtain fertility indices close to Indian experience. However
these adjustments are made to study the
impact of variations of the distribution of
d on fertility.

be estimated from observed distributions of
live birth intervals. Using the Gandhigram
data, Srinivasan (1966) has estimated the
parameters of a Beta distribution which is
assumed to represent the fecundability
distribution. The following values give

estimates of the Beta parameters as well
as the mean fecundability:

Birth Mean .
Interval tu v Fecundability
2-3 6.342 56,054 0.102
3-4 6.302 55.666 0.102

where « and v are Beta parameters.

Other studies also show that the maximum
fecundability is found near the age at
which the third live birth occurs (namely
shortly before age 25) and that the maximum mean fecundability is about 0.10.
The Khanna study reported a menstruating interval of about 10 months which
approximately corresponds to a fecundability (assuming women are homogeneous)
of 0.10 since mean fecundability is the
reciprocal of the mean menstruating interval in the homogeneous case without fetal
losses. If fetal losses of 20% are considered, the fecundability would be slightly
more than 0.10,

Now we are left with the final parameter, that is the age at which fecundability
attains a maximum value. This can be
estimated from the age at which the
fertility attains a maximum value. In Table
3 the age-specific marital fertility rates as
given by National Sample Survey (195859) (prorated) and Mysore Fertility
Study (United Nations, 1961) are given.
It is quite clear that the rates of Mysore
are quite close to the adjusted National
Sample Survey rates. The modal ages of
the two sets of age-specific marital fertility
rates are respectively 23.72 and 24.35. In
the present paper we shall use the National
Sample Survey rates as representative of
India.

maximum live-birth conceptions is about
nine months prior to the occurrence of
maximum live births (mean gestation period leading to a live birth) we can obtain
the modal age for the live-birth conception
rate using the live birth rate. If we assume
that age of maximum fecundability is halfway between the conception waiting time
we have: age of maximum fecundability
(in months) = age of maximum fertility
minus 9 minus 0.5/ (mean modal fecundability). In our case, by applying the above
relation to National Sample Survey rates
with mean modal fecundability of 0.10, we
have the ages of maximum fecundability as
22.55 years or 271 months,

It is sometimes possible that the age at
which the maximum fecundability is
reached may not be the same for all
women. A study of the age-specific fertility rates show that the rates for the
ages 20-30 could be assumed more or less
stable. Thus, one can assume the age of
maximum fecundability may be uniformly
distributed between women with a mean
moda! fecundability age of 271 months. It
can be assumed that women have their
modal fecundability ages uniformly distributed over ages (271—M%L, 271+
141). Here L could be taken as the extent
of the spread of the modal age. It can be
assumed to take a value of 60 months, or
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

410

near about that value, as the fertility in
the middle five-year age groups is stable.
However, a reliable estimate of Z can be
found from the single-year age-specific
fertility rates if they are available. The
true value of Z can be obtained by trial.
If Z is taken as one (in this case, the range
is x — %, x + Y, ie., x months) it implies that all women are assumed to reach
maximum fecundability at the same age.
(It is to be remembered that the unit of
time in the present study is taken as a
month, which corresponds to a menstrual
cycle). Thus, if y is the age of maximum
fecundability of a woman where 271 —
L/ 2<y9<271-+4L/2; then the corresponding probability, F4(v) = 1/Z. Thus
we have obtained possible probability distributions of the four parameters of the
fecundability curve.

Of the four fecundability parameters, ¢
and 5 can be estimated without much
difficulty from data on the onset of menarche and age-specific marital fertility
rates. Estimation of the mean value of the
modal fecundability can be made from
various types of demographic data on intervals between births, age-specific marital
fertility rates, and so on. The estimation
of d becomes somewhat difficult because
of lack of data on menopause. However,
data on age at the birth of the last child
can be taken as a first approximation. In
this paper the values for all parameters directly observed or estimated from data
have been found satisfactory except for d.
Hence some approximate values of d are
used so that the resultant fertility measures
are consistent with observed data.

Now the natural question one puts is
whether the use of all these input probability functions reproduce measures of
fertility such as age-specific marital fertility rates, mean number of live births for
women of completed fertility, intervals
between live births, and so on. To provide

Venkatacharya

Social Biology

an answer to this question one needs a
relationship of each one of the parameters
a, b, e and d of the fecundability curve,
and other biological parameters, such as
period of gestation, to the fertility indices
such as age-specific marital fertility rates,
intervals between births, and so on. Although certain mathematical relationships
exist between the above variables, in very
restrictive cases, there are no relationships
available for a set of general conditions.
As a result we have developed a Monte
Carlo model which can use fecundability
and other biological parameters as inputs
and produce most of the above mentioned
fertility measures.

MONTE CARLO MODEL (FERSIM)

The present model is similar to the
usual cohort simulation model developed
by Ridley and Sheps (1966) and also to
a model developed by the present author
earlier. However, in the present model, in
addition to the variation of fecundability
by age, which was used in the earlier
models, variation of fecundability among
women of identical ages is taken into
account. Other biological parameters used
in this model are quite similar to those
used in the earlier models,

The assumptions underlying the model
are: (1) marriage is considered as universal; (2) the unit of time is considered
as a month, which is nearly equal to the
mean inter-menstrum; (3) mortality is
ignored. The means and standard deviations of various inputs are shown in Table 4.

The model simulates fertility of married
fecund women from their marriage to the
end of reproductive life and records all
events necessary for the computation of
various fertility indices. It has been assumed that about 6% of women are primarily sterile. All events are generated on
the basis of the input probability density

functions corresponding to the specific
event.

At the outset, age at marriage and age
at onset of fecundity are assigned by the
Monte Carlo method. The age at marriage
is taken as the starting point of reproductive life so long as the age at onset of
fecundity is less than age at marriage. In
other cases, age at onset of fecundity is
taken as the starting point of reproductive
life.

Onset of menopause is taken as the end

F (1 a (: oe a’ — b’
xv’) —e’> ee ee — ——_— } exp ——_—
(x’) € b’ a’ d’ Bb’ ] b’ a”’

where a’, b’, d’ and e’ are randomly assigned to a woman through a Monte Carlo
method using corresponding probability
densities, explained in the previous section.
It can be seen that, just as age at marriage
or age at widowhood are assigned to a
woman at one time, the four fecundability
parameters are assigned to each woman at
one time. Once the four parameters are assigned to an individual woman the fecunda
of reproductive life. For the computation
of fecundability (Equation [2]) the age at
the onset of fecundity and onset of menopause are taken as the terminal ages of
fecundity. Starting from the age at marriage or age at onset of fecundity the
woman is exposed to the risk of conception
in every month till she either conceives or
reaches the end of reproductive life.

The fecundability of a woman is determined from the equation:

(2)

bility corresponding to any age can be
computed by Equation (2). Thus, the
occurrence of a conception in any month
is recorded if the inequality R < F,, where
R is a pseudo random number is satisfied.

Once conception occurs, the outcome of
a conception, i.e., live birth, still birth, or
abortion, is determined by the usual Monte
Carlo method. Depending on the outcome
of conception, the pregnancy periods as
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

well as the post-partum amenorrhea petiods are assigned, which will help updating the age of the woman. At the end of
the postpartum period the woman returns
to fecund state and the reproductive
process repeats.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In the second section, the impact of
changes in a, 0, e, and d on fecundability
pattern has been given. However, what
we are interested in is the impact of these
parameters on fertility, which not only depends on fecundability but also on a number of other biological variables. Since
there does not exist an explicit relationship
between these variables and fertility, the
Monte Carlo model described earlier has
been employed to obtain some idea of
these relationships. To this end, a number
of computer runs are made with various
numerical values of the fecundability parameters and resultant fertility indices are
analyzed. For want of space, only a brief
summary of the results is given:

1. It has been observed that the fertility generated by assuming equal fecundability for women of the same age is
larger than the generated fertility under
the assumption of unequal fecundability
for women of the same age, a fact illustrated by other authors also. The reason
for this is obvious if we consider the waiting time for conception which is larger
in the case of heterogeneous fecundability
than homogeneous fecundability.

2. Shift in the input distribution of @
modifies fertility rates in the age groups
15-19 and also 35-39 and 40-44. The
effect on the middle age groups is small.
The direction in which the changes are
brought about in fertility is the same as
in the case of fecundability. Shift in the
input distribution of d affects fertility
mostly in the last two or three age groups
and often the magnitude of this change

 

Social Biology

is of the same order as one could get if
the same shift is made in the input distribution of a. Small changes in these distributions do not make appreciable changes
in fertility, especially in the case of d, in
comparison with the built-in sampling
errors due to Monte Carlo (Roy and
Venkatachanya, mimeo).

3. The rates in general, and especially
for the middle age groups as well as the
upper terminal ages, are very much affected
by the three parameters 0, e and L. The
value of Z to a large extent determined
the curve of fertility in the three age groups
20-24, 25-29 and 30-34. For a fixed e,
changes in Z substantially affect the age
pattern of fertility.

4. The simulated age-specific marital
fertility rate for the age group 15-19 was
always found to be lower than the observed rate. This is because of assumption
in the model that marriages do not take
place before age 15, as a result of which
almost no birth occurred at age 15. In order to approximately take care of this situation, the rate is computed only on ages
16 to 19 and this rate is assumed for the
age group. These rates are shown within
parentheses in Table 5.

The above relationships greatly help in
adjusting the input values of fecundability
parameters in a Monte Carlo model in
order to yield the required pattern of
age-specific marital fertility rates.

Using a value of Z = 60, the age distribution of menarche, the mean modal age of
fecundability of 271 months and the assumed distribution A of terminal age
(Table 2) in the Monte Carlo model, agespecific marital fertility rates are generated
(shown in Table 5, col. 2). In the following
we refer to Table 5 unless otherwise mentioned. These rates are lower than the
observed rates at all ages especially for
age groups 35-39 and 40-44,

fertility rate for the age range 35-44 the
modal age of fecundability has been given
a shift of 15 months, which can be considered as a somewhat maximum permissible error in our estimate of modal fecundability age (col. 3). But even this
adjustment did not sufficiently inflate the
rates, especially for the last two age groups.
Other adjustments in Z and 8 around 60
and 271 respectively also did not yield
satisfactory results for the last two age
groups. This gave an indication that the
assumed distribution for d could be on
the low side. Therefore one set with the
earlier distribution of a, b = 276 and the
distribution B of menopause in Table 2
have been used to yield age-specific marital fertility rates (col. 4) which also did
not give results close to observed rates for
age groups 35~40 and 40-44. After these
observations, the earlier hypothesis that
fecundability gradually decreased and became zero with menopause appears doubtful. A value of age-specific marital fertility
rates of 69 per thousand married women

for age group 40-44 seems difficult to
achieve consistent with the earlier hypothesis.

In the light of the above comments, it
was found reasonable to assume that at
both terminal ages, fecundability possess
some nonzero values. However, in the
present case, since we are interested in
the age-specific marital fertility rates for
ages above 15, the assumption of zero
fecundability at menarche did not appear
serious; but the zero-fecundability assumption at menopause is more important.
In order to increase fertility at terminal
age, the distribution A of Table 2 has been
shifted to higher ages successively, the
values exceeding age 59 are excluded, and
the distribution is inflated to make total
probability one.

The amount of shift needed can be
approximately obtained. We can observe
in the single-year simulated age-specific
marital fertility rate pattern the age at
which the rate of 69 (observed for age
group 40-44) occurs. Suppose a simulated

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

414 Venkatacharya

age-specific marital fertility rate gives this
rate approximately at 39 years. Then we
need a shift of 2 = (42.5-39) years in the
distribution of d. This approximation (true
only for the present case) has been sufficient to reduce the trials needed to obtain
a close fit. One such set of rates are shown
in column 5.

Once we found the fit satisfactory we can
generate another replicate to see whether
this fit could be due to chance. Therefore,
a set of age-specific marital fertility rates
based on 2,000 simulated women has been
shown in column 6. From Table 5 we find
the mean number of live births for the
above parameter combination is 6.0, which
is close to the Indian experience. The interval between live births is 40 months,
also quite close to the Indian experience,
which is in the range of 40 months (Table
5, col. 1) However, when the simulated
mean live birth intervals of various orders
(based on women of completed fertility)
are compared with the corresponding observed means, they are found to be on the
high side. This could be due to the truncation effect (Venkatacharya, 1969). Taking
into account this aspect, the simulated
mean can be assumed to be reasonable.

From the above manipulation of parameters, it appears that more than one set of
parameters can be made to produce the
same fertility rates. Although a unique set
of parameters may not be obtained by the
above procedure, it is possible that the
various parameters found to yield a given
set of fertility rates may not be very different from one another for all practical
purposes. In such a case, if we can fix some
parameters as more firmly known than
others then the range of parameter sets
can be drastically cut down. Again, if
choice is made of such parameter sets that
give simultaneously a number of consistent
fertility measures, such as mean number of
live births, mean live-birth interval, age

close to observed data, the range of parameter sets will be brought down substantially.

Thus it is reasonable to assume the
following values for the four parameters
of fecundability for Indian women:

1, The distribution of onset of fecundity can be approximated by age at menarche with a mean around 13.5 years,

2. The modal fecundability value can
be assumed to be normally distributed with
a mean 0.10 and variance 0.0014.

3. The age of modal fecundability can
be assumed to be uniformly distributed
between ages 251-301 months.

4. The terminal age of fecundity appears to be higher than the observed distribution of menopause. The distribution
for this age shown in the last column of
Table 6 seems to be reasonable.
