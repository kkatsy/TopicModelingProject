ABSTRACT: The sex difference in perinatal mortality in developed countries is largely unexplained. The current study evaluated the differences in the impact of maternal smoking during
pregnancy on the risk of perinatal death between males and females. The analysis involved 11,469
and 9,404 newborns derived from two population-based birth cohorts in Northern Finland, for
1966 and 1985-86, respectively. The perinatal mortality rate was 23 per thousand in the 1966 cohort and 9 per thousand in the 1985-86 cohort. The rate ratio (RR) for mortality for males over
females is 1.15 and 1.60 in the two cohorts, respectively. Among children whose mothers smoked
during pregnancy, the RR was 2.2 (95% CI 1.0, 4.7) for the former cohort and 4.8 (95% CI 1.5,
15.2) for the later cohort; and among the children whose mothers did not smoke the corresponding RR was 1.2 (95% C1 0.9, 1.6) and 1.1 (95% CI 0.6, 1.9). Maternal smoking during pregnancy
could be an important determinant accounting for the excess perinatal death for males over fe
males. Our results encourage evaluation of the findings among other populations.

A higher sex ratio (males/females) in
perinatal mortality has been consistently
observed in the Nordic countries and
other developed countries (Bolander,
1984; United Nations, 1993). It appears
that because of inherent sex differences
male newborns have a higher risk of mortality due to difficult labor, birth injuries,
and disease and accidents affecting the
mothers (Lopez and Ruzicka, 1983). Females can be expected to experience
lower mortality than males by virtue of
their natural biological superiority
(Lopez, 1984; Wingard, 1984). However,
a substantial part of excess perinatal
death among boys over girls still cannot
be explained. We have less knowledge
about the roles of environmental factors
on the existing sex differentials in perinatal mortality in these countries. Maternal
smoking during pregnancy is believed to
be associated with the higher risk of

small-for-gestational-age births and low
weight at births (Cnattingius and
Haglund, 1997), which are the most important determinants for perinatal mortality (WHO 1984). Studies have also
showed that maternal smoking during
pregnancy has sex-specific effects on fetuses (Wertelecki et al., 1987). The aim of
the current analysis is to explore the associations between maternal smoking during pregnancy and the sex differences in
perinatal mortality.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The study was conducted on two population-based birth cohorts from Northern
Finland, one for 1966 and the other for
1985-86. The two birth cohorts consist of
12,231 and 9,479 births, respectively,
comprising 96 per cent and 99 per cent of
all births in the provinces of Oulu and

Lapland with their expected date falling
between January 1 and December 31 in
the former, and between July 1, 1985 and
June 30, 1986 in the latter (Rantakallio,
1969; Rantakallio and Oja, 1990). The
data on deaths were derived from the national deaths register. The definition of
perinatal mortality rate is the number of
stillbirths and deaths in the first week of
life per 1,000 live and still births (WHO,
1975). Cases of missing information on
sex, gestational age, and birthweight were
excluded. The numbers of births included
in this analysis were thus 11,469 and
9,404 in the two cohorts, respectively.
The gestational age used in the analysis was calculated as the interval between
the first day of the last menstrual period
and the day of delivery. In the later cohort, missing information on gestational
age based on menstrual period (for 365
cases) was supplemented with ultrasonic
findings. Information on mothers was obtained from questionnaires completed by
mothers’ antenatal visits to clinics. Maternal age was classified into groups of
=19, 20-29, and =30 years; maternal
smoking, as 0 if mothers did not smoke
before pregnancy or smoked but gave up
during pregnancy vs. 1 if they smoked
both before and during the pregnancy;
birth of child, 0 for primiparae, 1 for multiparae with 1 to 2 children, and 2 for
those with equal to or over 3 children;
birth weight, as =2500g vs. <2500g; and
gestational weeks, as =37 vs. <37.
Perinatal mortality rate, rate ratio
(RR), and corresponding 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) for males over females were calculated by each category
of the determinants under study. Logistic
regression models were employed to
evaluate the sex differences in mortality
by maternal smoking status after adjust

ing for the effects of other determinants
together in the same model.

RESULTS

The perinatal mortality rate was 23 per
thousand in the 1966 cohort and 9 per
thousand in the 1985-86 one. Both cohorts had an excess of male over female
perinatal deaths, with the RR being 1.15
and 1.60 in the two cohorts, respectively
(Table 1). In both cohorts, statistically
significant higher excess perinatal death
for males over females was observed
among mothers who smoked during pregnancy, the RRs being 2.1 (95% CI 1.1,
4.2) for the former one and 4.0 (95% Cl
1.4, 12.0) for the latter one, respectively.
In addition, substantial higher RR was
also observed among children whose
mothers had 3 or more children in the
former cohort, and among singletons or
low-birth-weight (<2500g) or preterm
births (<37 gestational weeks) children
for the later cohort. Among the determinants under analysis, maternal smoking
during pregnancy seemed to be the
strongest factor explaining the observed
sex differences in perinatal mortality.

Separate analyses were done for those
children whose mothers smoked and
those children whose mothers did not
smoke during pregnancy, after adjusting
for other determinants by logistic regression models (Table 2). The RR was 2.2
for the former cohort and 4.8 for the latter
cohort among those children whose
mothers smoked, and 1.2 and 1.1 among
the children whose mothers did not
smoke during pregnancy.

DISCUSSION
The current study shows that in both
Finnish cohorts males suffered higher

perinatal mortality than females; and maternal smoking during pregnancy seemed
to be an important determinant explaining
the observed sex difference. In the former
cohort, boys suffered a 2.2-fold higher
risk of perinatal death than girls if their
mothers smoked during pregnancy and
only a 1.2-fold risk if their mothers didn’t
smoke. The corresponding risks for the
later cohort are 4.8-fold and 1.1-fold, respectively. The above results are observed
after adjusting for potential confounders.
However, it is not clear what the biological mechanism is which can explain why
mothers who smoke during pregnancy
exerted a higher effect on excess perinatal
death among boys over girls than mothers
who do not smoke.

In animal studies, nicotine has been
shown to have sex-dependent effects on
the fetus (Levin et al., 1993; Fung and
Lau, 1989; Ribary and Lichtensteiger,
1989). Perters and Tang (1982) found that
prenatal nicotine treatment of dogs reduced both the number of male pups born
and male birth weight, but female pups
tended to be unaffected.

Human studies reveal that nicotine
causes a reduction in uteroplacental blood
flow and Jeads to hypoxia of the fetus (Pijpers et al., 1984). Mercelina-Roumans
and colleagues (1995) report that the
white cell and neutrophil counts in cord

blood are significantly decreased in male
newborns of smoking mothers compared
with those of nonsmoking mothers and
female newborns of smokers. The results
suggest that the consequence of the decrease in the total white cell and neutrophil counts might be a reduction in resistance to infection in the male newborn
infant of the smoking mothers, and this
effect may persist throughout the neonatal period (Smith and Landaw, 1978).

The lungs of male fetuses are believed
to mature more slowly during intrauterine
development due to the effects of testosterone (Nielsen et al., 1982). Studies show
that newborns have a less developed lung
function if they were exposed prenatally
to cigarette smoke than nonexposed newborns (Stick et al., 1996; Hanrahan et al.,
1992; Brown et al., 1995). One study indicates that a dose-response association of
maternal smoking with proportional reduction of birth weight and length appears
to be stronger in the case of a male fetus
(WHO, 1984). Size at birth is believed to
be an important determinant of perinatal
mortality.

By reviewing available studies, we
have the impression that male fetuses are
probably more sensitive to the adverse effect of exposure to maternal smoking
during pregnancy than females, which
may have predisposed male fetus and

newborns to experience higher risk of
perinatal death. Our results encourage
further evaluation of the impacts of maternal smoking during pregnancy on the

sex differentials in perinatal mortality and
exploration of a reasonable biological
mechanism underlying the association
observed.
