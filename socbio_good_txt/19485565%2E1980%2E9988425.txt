Inbreeding and Ecological Change: An Isonymic
Analysis of Secular Trends in a Tyneside Parish Over

Three Centuries

ABSTRACT: Marriage entries in the parish records of Whickham, near Newcastle in the North of
England, are analyzed by isonomy. Over the three centuries (1566-1866), a period including the
atrival of the industrial revolution in the region, secular changes occur in the level of inbreeding.
There is a general relationship of inbreeding level with demographic change and particularly with

socioeconomic pattern.

The elaboration by Crow and Mange
(1965) of the idea that the degree of inbreeding of a population could be calculated from the frequency of isonymous
marriages, i.e., marriages between persons of the same surname, led to aseries of
analyses of historical marriage records
(Hussels, 1969; Azevedo et al., 1969;
Morton and Hussels, 1970; Swedlund,
1971; Rawling, 1973; Bourgoin and
Khang, 1978; Fried] and Ellis, 1974;
Halberstein and Crawford, 1975;
Kashyap, 1978). Despite its drawbacks,
the method was shown to be particularly
useful in the estimation of inbreeding in
those situations where conventional
methods of analysis could not be applied,
for it provided important information impossible to obtain otherwise. Particularly
informative was its application within a
relatively restricted geographical area to
examine secular change in inbreeding in a
single population, because in this case the
extent to which the assumptions implicit in
the method are met is likely to vary less
than between samples from different
areas and cultures. Indeed, the secular
patterns revealed by isonymous marriages
in given localities appear to parallel trends

in demographic and biological development detectable in other historical sources
(Roberts and Rawling, 1974).

In the north of England the historical
records are particularly useful for tracing
the evolution of the local population in relation to its changing circumstances. The
present analysis relates to the parish of
Whickham in the Tyne valley, now a suburb of Newcastle (see map, Figure 1). The
analysis is interesting since it covers the
period of the arrival of the industrial revoJution and illustrates the effect of this major economic change on the genetic structure of the population.

HISTORY OF WICKHAM
THE CHANGING ECOLOGY

Whickham, as its name indicates, was a
Saxon settlement, the colonists being attracted by the rich agricultural land on the
lower slopes and valley bottoms, the
wealth of timber on the hillsides, the
abundance of fish in the river, and the access for their boats. The first written records of Whickham date from 1183, when
the entry in the Norman Boldon Book
notes that there were 35 tenants each

holding 15 acres of land, and one headman
with 24 acres, paying in return rent and appreciable services to the Bishop of
Durham. In the 1380’s Bishop Hatfield’s
survey listed 43 tenants; there had been
little change.

Thus it remained for several centuries,
a typical north-country rural area, experiencing the periodica] disasters of such
settlements. Border raids were endemic.
For example, in 1312 it is noted that the
goods of the church were wholly destroyed or carried away by the Scots, who
also burned and destroyed much of the
neighborhood. Mountain robbers continually descended on the rich village lands
for plunder. In consequence of the wars
with the Scots, in 1314 there was a dreadful famine, in which corn rose to an enormous price and the inhabitants of the villages are said to have fed on carrion and
human flesh, and this continued in 1315
on account of excessive rain during the
harvest period, leading to many deaths

Inbreeding and Ecological Change 231

through starvation. Famines continued
from time to time, for example in 1587
when many people starved on account of
the extortionate prices charged for the
small amount of grain available. Epidemics occurred every few years. In 1416,
1597, 1610, 1645, and 1647 occurred five
of the several epidemics of plague; in
1824, an epidemic of smallpox; in
1831-32, one of cholera, in which numbers of people died.

Civil disturbances also occurred, for
example, the unsuccessful rebellion of
1569 and the invasions by the Scots in 1640
and 1644. Between such episodes, however, the richness of life is apparent. In
1343 there was mention of the importance
of the Tyne for merchant shipping, richness in corn and other merchandise, and
fish. The traditional pattern of rural life,
enriched by the presence of a major waterway from the hinterland and the proximity
of a city, continued until the agrarian revolution, which reached Whickham in 1672
when the first of the divisions of the common fields occurred.

The shape of things to come, however,
was foreshadowed as long ago as the midfourteenth century, for in 1346 occurs the
first mention of the importance of the coal
mines, when the Bishop of Durham
granted a lease of the mine under the
manors of Whickham and Gateshead to
Sir Thomas Gray, laying down strict regulations as to the maximum amount of coal
to be extracted each day. Similar mention
of the coal mines occurs from time to time
through the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, conferring leases and,
unfortunately, recording deaths in the
mines. The pattern was that of a family
and domestic industry, but one to which
more and more importance was being attached. During the seventeenth century
the coal industry saw great expansion. The
shallow seams from the rising ground beside the river at Whickham were fully ex

ploited, and in the second half of the
seventeenth century the economic wealth
of Tyneside based on its coal was well established. |

Then came the industrial revolution
which left its mark on northern Britain,
and of which some of the earlier phases occurred in the northeast. An ironworks initiated within Whickham parish in 1691
was prospering by 1694. Here, and in factories later established elsewhere on Tyneside, were ‘“‘made by many hundreds of
smiths, all the tools for husbandry, for our
West Indies, mattocks, admirable spades,
hoes, etc. Here in huge furnaces are
formed axes of vast size, chains of prodigious magnitude for our ships of war, East
Indiamen, and all Europe; while useful
implements of household furniture are
here glancing to the astonished sight of the
curious stranger.’’ The conditions attaching to the Whickham development are
very interesting for their social concept.
The founder built a chapel, employed a
clergyman and physician, endowed a free

‘school for the education of children, built
a home for retired workers, established a
fund from which were drawn benefits for
the sick and old. It was expected that the
work force would give some loyalty in return, and in 1722 the following articles of
agreement were entered into: ‘Every
workman to give 6 months notice before
leaving his employment, and if before the
expiration of that time the workman is
found employed at any other place within
40 miles of Newcastle by which the agreement is broken, renders himself liable toa
penalty of £50” The works flourished, and
the high quality of its products attracted
an international reputation.

In the early eighteenth century the coal
industry ran into difficulties when the shallow seams began to be worked out. Coal
was sought at deeper levels and in localities further from the river. The deeper
mining depended upon the development

Social Biology

of new techniques and equipment, for example, stronger pumps, and on more capital than could be provided by the simple
family partnerships by which many pits
were still worked in the early eighteenth
century. This was the beginning of a
movement that continued into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As the
easily accessible local shallow deposits of
coal in the Whickham area were worked
out, coal mining moved eastwards towards the sea, broaching the deeper
seams. At the same time, industry moved
down river toward the deeper waters capable of accommodating the larger ships
and the larger amounts of iron brought in
from Teesside after 1850.

In the early eighteenth century also, as
a result of the agrarian improvements,
dairy farming was developed, a strong
butter industry established (with exports _
beginning in 1730), and sowing of barley,
oats, wheat, hay, and clover begun. Today
there is little heavy industry in Whickham,
and it is mainly a dormitory suburb of
Newcastle, though still with appreciable
agricultural interests.

Here then can be traced a distinct ecological progression, from simple coloniststyle farming and way of life of the early
Saxons and their antecedents, through the
peasant farming of medieval times, followed by the development, slow at first, of
domestic extractive industry and subsequently of heavy manufacturing industry,
initially using local and then imported materials, and finally the almost total departure of industry, leaving a partly agricultural and primarily dormitory suburb.

DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES

With this pronounced change in the ecological pattern of Whickham came major
demographic changes. Today the population consists of some 28,000 persons, in
comparison with the 35 tenants and one

headman with their families (say some 200
persons) of 1183 a.p. Detailed demographic records are not to be expected before the nineteenth century. There is an
estimate of the population in 1781 when it
numbered 3,750, and then from 1801 onwards the census every ten years showed a
population rising from 3,659 to 9,143 in
1891. Most of this rise, however, appears
to have occurred from 1831 onwards, for
in the preceding generations the figures
were fairly constant at about 3,700. Materials from which the earlier demographic
evolution of the population can be inferred
date from the institution of the parish registers in 1576. The entries are neither full
enough nor precise enough to allow details of demographic structure to be established, but they give some indication of
the changes that occurred over time.

The number of marriages per year (Figure 2) suggests a slowly increasing population, with a general level rising from
perhaps 12 to 18 marriages per year from
1580 until 1700. There were, however,
quite pronounced fluctuations about the
general level. There appear to be peaks at

approximately 38- to 40-year intervals, in
1609, 1646, and 1679, and corresponding
troughs in 1590, 1627, 1657, and 1694, suggesting some cyclic phases in the population. In some years, disaster appears to exert some effect, e.g., in the plague year of
1587 there were only three weddings recorded in comparison with the general
level in that decade of ten per year. In
others, known disasters appear to have
had little detectable effect. In the year of
the Covenanters’ invasion (1640) there
were 14 unions by comparison with the
general level of 17; but it is interesting that
in 1642, the year following the withdrawal
of the Scots, there were 40 unions, so
perhaps some had been deferred. In the
early eighteenth century, the number of
marriages continues to rise about the previous peak levels. After a further higher
peak about 1720-23 the following period
of decline in the number of marriages
proved to be short, and the numbers soon
continued to increase to a maximum in
1747. This period of steady increase in
numbers from the mid-1690’s to the 1740’s
coincided with the period of establish

ment, growth, and prosperity of the
ironworks factory. At the time of its foundation there were few skilled workmen in
the north of England, and it is reasonable
to think that men were brought in from
elsewhere. The increase in the number of
marriages then suggests an increase in total population size in which immigration is
likely to have played an important part;
yet it may also indicate better survival of
children in those prosperous times.

There follows a rapid decline in marriages to a trough in 1758-59, and a final
peak in 1776-78. It is of interest that this
occurs Only a few years later than a 35- to
40-year cycle would indicate and at approximately the same elevation as the
trend in the earlier peaks. There is a
strong impression that the 1746-47 peak ts
intrusive upon a preexisting and continuing cyclic system.

The decline in the number of marriages
per year from the mid-eighteenth century
is partly due to the rise of the nonconformists, who preferred to marry in their own
chapels outside the Church of England;
certainly there was a flourishing Methodist chapel in Whickham by 1759. But
there was also in the early nineteenth century a depression in the iron trade. There

was great distress among the work people
of Whickham, and indeed many were employed on the roads and in unskilled laboring to alleviate starvation. Part of the
decline therefore must represent an actual
decrease in the population as factories
further down river developed and the
workers moved to them, and it was these
rather than Whickham that responded to
the increased demand for iron brought by
the coming of the railways and the great
nineteenth century heavy industries.

Examination of the number of baptisms per year (Figure 3) shows a similar
picture. There is a steady expansion in
numbers with peaks at 1616, 1651, 1686,
1717-19, and 1744. The first three peaks of

practically coincide. Similar patterns are
shown by baptisms considered separately
according to sex.

analysis, provide sufficient information
for the isonymic method to be applied and
to give some indication of the breeding
structure and how it changed over time.

The method ts essentially that of Crow
and Mange (1965) which is based on the
constant relationship observed between
the probability of affinal relatives (persons
derived from the same stock) having the
same surname (P) and the inbreeding
coefficient (autosomal) of their possible
offspring (F), such that P/F is always equal
to 4. In the case of sibs, for example, the
probability of their having the same surname (P) is 1 and the inbreeding
coefficient (F) of the offspring of a sibunion is ¥%. Similarly, for first cousins
P=¥Y, (only father’s brother’s offspring
have the same surname) and F="e,
(father’s father’s brother’s son’s offspring)
and F = Ys, so that in all cases P/F is equal
to 4. Apart from rare exceptions that can
arise from gross cumulative inbreeding or
from ancestor-descendant marriages, the
majority of inbreeding situations encountered in human societies are covered by
this relationship and thus surnames can be
used, in cultures where they are transmitted in some regular (usually unilineal) pattern, to estimate the inbreeding
coefficients of the population. No exceptions were found in the present study.

In a randomly mating population ifp, is
the proportion of males in the population
with a particular surname and q, is the corresponding proportion of females, isonymous marriages will occur with a frequency of pq, The contribution these
make to the overall inbreeding coefficient
of the population is p.q/4; this function,
summed over all surnames, becomes
(Xpq)/4. This represents the random contribution to inbreeding in the population,
the equivalent of Sewall Wright’s inbreeding component F., which may be defined
as “‘the probability of identical homozygosity due to the chance union of relatives

Inbreeding and Ecological Change

235

under conditions of random mating in
finite populations” or, in terms of what it
actually measures in the population, as
‘the departure, from the amount of
homozygosis expected under conditions
of panmixia, caused by consanguineous
matings occurring at random in a finite
population.” This is represented by Allen
(1965) as F’ and it is this random component that isonymy specifically relates.
Crow and Mange (1965), following Allen,
show how F. may be used to calculate both
F, the nonrandom component of F
(Wright’s original F,.) and F itself, the total inbreeding coefficient of the population, using the following related formulae:

F. = (2pq)/4
, = (P-2pqy/4(— 2 pq),
where P represents the
proportion of isonymous marriages that
occur in the population,

F = F,+ (1~F/)F.

F and F are always positive values, but F
can be either positive or negative according to the mating pattern of the population
concerned—positive if more consanguineous unions occur than chance alone
would allow and negative if consanguineous unions are deliberately avoided.

To understand the genetic structure of
a population, this distinction between random and nonrandom components of inbreeding is important, for their effects on
genetic structure can be compared, and,
by implication, some understanding obtained of the ways (actual and potential) in
which changes in that structure are
brought about. It has been usefully applied in the examination of secular trends
in genetic structure in Northumberland
(Rawling, 1973; Roberts and Rawling,
1974).

The analysis of the Whickham material
was carried out using 25-year periods to

correspond with those used in the earlier
Northumberland study. The analysis was
carried out for a three-hundred—year period, 1586-1886, preceded by a seven-year
period 1579-86.

The numbers of marriages used in the
analysis are set out in Table 1, together
with the details of the numbers of names.
The number of marriages per 25-year period showed an increase reaching its peak
in the middle of the eighteenth century,
and declining thereafter. The total number of different surnames in each 25-year
period remained fairly constant until the
end of the seventeenth century, increased
rapidly again to the middle of the eighteenth century, then declined to its former
level. The increase coincides with the development of the ironworks and the immigration of labor suggested by the demographic analysis.

Isonymous marriages at the end of the
sixteenth century and the beginning of the
seventeenth occur approximately in the
numbers that were to be expected under
random mating, and in the period 1612-36
were slightly in excess. But thereafter they
are consistently below the numbers expected, particularly deficient in the 125
Social Biology

year period 1687-1811, which suggests
that the industrial immigration and the
families to which it gave rise greatly expanded the pool of potential spouses.
Only after active emigration had occurred
during the depressed period of the early
nineteenth century did the number of
isonymous unions (reflecting consanguineous unions) again approach those expected by chance, and only toward the end
of the nineteenth century do they again
exceed expected numbers. There is obviously a chance element in the number of
isonymous unions actually observed in
any one period. But certainly the general
pattern appears to be established, that the
number of isonymous marriages throughout most of the period under study was
consistently less than that expected under
random mating.

Atall periods, the number of marriages
and the distribution of male and female
names among them is such that under random mating a low inbreeding coefficient
for the population would be expected. In
the first 150 years (to 1711) the number of
names remains fairly constant, suggesting
that the umber of new names (i.e., newcomers to the population) balances the

few lost by wastage, for example due to
mortality of carriers of infrequent names,
or variation in sex ratio of offspring. The
number of marriages, however, increases.
The population appears to be growing
mainly by natural increase internally, with
not very much addition from outside. In
the next fifty years the increase of some
two-thirds in the number of names indicates immigration, and this increase
nearly balances the increase in the number
of marriages indicating the expanded population. The decline that follows in both
suggests a diminishing population, retaining a nucleus of families, looking into itself
more and more for marriage and continuity.

The inbreeding levels of the population
calculated from the marriage data are set
out in Table 2. Figures for F , the random
component of the total inbreeding, range
from 0.0023 in the initial period and a similar value in the final period of the study up
to 0.0059 at the beginning of the nineteenth century. There was a general trend
toward an increase for the first 150 years
compatible with that to be expected in a
fairly stable, slowly growing, not too isolated population. There follows a slight

dip, and then a peak toward the end of the
eighteenth century, that coincides with
the decline in population suggested by the
diminishing marriage numbers. Then
throughout the nineteenth century the
value of F declined rapidly (Figure 4).
The calculated nonrandom component
of inbreeding, F,, showed converse
trends. Values range from —0.0056 up to
+ 0.0028, the positive values occurring at
the beginning and end of the period studied. From the initial slightly positive
values there was a decline throughout the

. first two hundred years, to a minimum at

the end of the eighteenth century followed
by a quite rapid rise in the nineteenth century. Clearly there was no preference for
consanguineous unions during the period,
but indeed the reverse and especially during the decline in population in the late
eighteenth century. The overall inbreeding coefficient (F) which is made up of
these two components, random and nonrandom, is consistently low throughout
the period (Figure 5). There is a trend toward a slight increase in the first 50 years,
due to similar slight increase in both random and nonrandom components compatible with the fairly stable but slowly
growing initial population. This is followed by diminution to the end of the seventeenth century due mainly to the nonrandom component, a virtual plateau in
the eighteenth century, and a rise in the
nineteenth. The values are much below
those observed in the smaller remoter parishes of Alwinton, Felton, Rothbury, and
Warkworth along the valley of the River
Coquet in the centre of Northumberland
(see map, Figure 1) (Roberts and Rawling, 1974).

ulation are transmitted regularly, and that
possible deviations from regularity due to
illegitimacy, adoption, or change of name,
are of negligible effect; that the population is monogamous; that consanguineous
relationships occur through male and female ancestors in similar proportions, and
that there is no preference for cousin marriage either overall or of particular types;
that neither sex is disproportionately represented among migrants into or out of the
population; that isonymy necessarily indicates common ancestry; and that there is
no difference of fertility distributions between consanguineous and nonconsanguineous unions. It also assumes (Crow,
1980) the occurrence of no inbreeding
loops based upon half-sib matings, very
unlikely in the population studied here.
Satisfaction of all these assumptions is
very unlikely in any population. Indeed in
some instances comparison of estimates

from isonymy with pedigree data indicates
considerable inflation (e.g., Bourgoin and
Khang, 1978).

Since possible causes of deviation from
these assumptions may vary from one
population to another, simple comparison
of different populations has to be treated
with caution. Differences in deviation
from these assumptions is less likely
within a single population, however, so
that any bias that results is likely to be
fairly constant in direction and possibly
amount. In the present case, isonymy has
provided some indication of the level of
inbreeding for a local population, and its
changes over a long historical period for
which other methods of analysis, in the absence of specific pedigree data, seems impossible.

The lower values of inbreeding than
those observed in the Coquet valley parishes is as expected on account of the difDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

ference in population size and the greater
accessibility of Whickham, which is more
representative of part of a mainstream
population than are the more isolated parishes of central Northumberland.

As regards developments within the
parish, it is interesting that it is the period
of 1636-61, which covered the episodes of
civil unrest and military activity, that initiated the decline in both F, and F, and this
reduction in the inbreeding level was continued into the time of the establishment
and development of the ironworks, and
this trend was concomitant with a steady
slight increase in F_. The highest level of F
and the lowest of F in the period
1786-1811 appears to coincide with the
time of prosperity associated with the Napoleonic Wars and armaments for it. The
following period, which virtually removed
the negative component of nonrandom inbreeding and halved the random component, saw the great distress occasioned by
the depression in the iron trade and the
outflow of workers from Whickham to
employment further down river. There

appears then to be some association of the
inbreeding levels with socioeconomic developments.

Comparing the trends in inbreeding
with the trends of population inferred
from the records, there appears to be a
general relationship in that the population
size as indicated by marriage and baptism
numbers follows a convex course, as does
the random component of inbreeding F ,
but the nonrandom component and total
inbreeding show the opposite, a concave
curve. The correlation cannot be pursued
in detail on account of the errors attaching
to the estimates of F and its components,
but it appears unlikely to be exact. For instance, the highest values of F. or the lowest of F_ do not coincide with periods of either the greatest or least population
numbers. Examination of trends is more
useful, and here it appears that the
change in F’ from one period to the next is
independent of the demographic numerical changes occurring, except perhaps in
the period 1811-36; the changes in F , and
therefore in total F, appear generally con

trary in direction to the demographic
changes. Clearly, in a population of the
size observed in Whickham over the three
centuries of the present study, there is no
simple relationship between demographic
evolution and its genetic structure, and
the latter indeed seems to respond more to
socioeconomic events. Demographic evo

lution is closely linked to ecology—indeed
demography is the thermometer of ecological success. The suggested complexity
of the interrelationship of genetic structure, demography, and socioeconomic
variation will provide materials for study
for some time to come.
