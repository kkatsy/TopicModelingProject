Differential Childlessness
A Further Examination

In a recent article, Kunz and Brinkerhoff (1969) postulate that there exists a
general belief that the rate of childlessness
is higher among white than among nonwhite couples.1 They argue that in fact
childlessness is considerably higher among
nonwhite populations. In support of their
argument, Kunz and Brinkerhoff ignore
previous research in this area (Grabill and
Glick, 1959) and refer to 1960 American
census data concerning white and nonwhite wives, married once with husband
present, ages 35-54,

Kunz and Brinkerhoff attempt to introduce controls for some of the variables
which may affect their data. They break
the data down by age cohorts (comparing
first marriage at 14 to 21 with first marriage at 22 or older) and by husband’s
education. Taking these controls into ac
1Kunz and Brinkerhoff provide no evidence
for the existence of their postulated belief in the
lower childlessness of nonwhites, other than to
indicate that such is the perception of a sample
of university undergraduates. Certainly such a
position would not be endorsed by demographers
or sociologists concerned with the relationship of
race and fertility. All such “experts” who have
considered the phenomenon of childlessness at all
have commented upon its higher incidence among
nonwhites. See, for example, Grabill and Glick,
1959; Mitra, 1966; Campbell, 1966.

count, the data still support the essential
message of their article, namely that: “a
greater proportion of the nonwhite couples
are childless than are the white couples”
(Kunz and Brinkerhoff, 1969, p. 719).

The present article will be concerned
with three questions not dealt with in
Kunz and Brinkerhoff’s discussion. First,
how does the incidence of childlessness
among whites and nonwhites vary among
age cohorts? Second, what causal factors
may have contributed to the differential
childlessness? Third, what trends may be
anticipated in the future?

CHILDLESSNESS AND AGE COHORTS

Kunz and Brinkerhoff do not explain
why they choose to limit their attention to
women in the 35-54 age group, other than
to suggest that these women would have
completed their childbearing “for the most
part.” The use of completed family size
as an index of fertility is a common demographic convention and is justified by
the rationale that, until the completion of
the menopause at the age of about fortyfive or forty-nine, a woman can always
have more children. What seems to have
escaped Kunz and Brinkerhoff is the ob

vious fact that she cannot have fewer and
that when looking for indices of childlessness, it is equally logical to examine the
fertility behavior of all women evermarried. When rates of  childlessness
among younger women are also considered, it becomes apparent that the
conclusions of Kunz and Brinkerhoff cannot be generalized to all cohorts and that
if present trends continue the rates of

white childlessness may exceed those for
nonwhites.

The 1960 American census includes
data on the number of children ever born
to women married once, husband present,
based on a 5% sample. The relative proportion of childlessness for whites and nonwhites is shown in Figure 1. Although
whites generally have a lower incidence of
childlessness than nonwhites, for the

younger categories, ages 15~24, the incidence is actually higher and for the ages
25-29, the difference is relatively small.

The rate of childlessness is significantly
affected by the age at first marriage and
by marriage duration. When controls are
introduced for these variables, the incidence of childlessness is again different
than would be expected on the basis of
Kunz and Brinkerhoff’s conclusions. At all
ages, among couples who have been
married for a year or less, the proportion
of childlessness is much higher among
white than nonwhite couples (Table 1).
When marriages of two years or less are
considered, the difference is still large and
in the same direction (Figure 2).

In marriages of from three to five years

of the nonwhites remained childless.
Since it is quite possible that some of these
childless wives will have at least one child
during the twenty-five years remaining
before the end of their childbearing period,
we could expect the lifetime rate of childlessness to approach 3 or 4%.? Only in
marriages of eleven to fifteen years’ duration, with wives 35 years of age or older,
do we find the high rates of childlessness
and the consistent variations along racial
lines suggested by Kunz and Brinkerhoff
(Figure 5).

the relationship of color and childlessness
is inconsistent; nonwhites have lower rates
in the 20-24 age group, and only slightly
higher rates for teenagers and women in
their late twenties (Figure 3). In marriages of from six to ten years’ duration,
young nonwhites are only slightly more
apt to be childless than young whites
(Figure 4).

It is significant that of women in their

decision to use birth control and/or abortion to prevent all births or to the sterility

2 These rates of childlessness are exceedingly
low. For example, the 1961 Canadian census
provides data on rural-farm women in Quebec
who were married between the ages of 15 to 19.
This population is predominantly Roman Catholic, and the incidence of voluntary childlessness,
and the effective use of birth control and/or
abortion to prevent all births can be assumed to
be minimal. Even among such an extreme population, the rate of childlessness for women 20-24
years was 10%. The average rate for women 45
years and older was 2.93%.

or subfecundity of one or both of the

Involuntary childlessness is usually
used to refer to sterility or to subfecundity.
Sterility may be of one of two kinds:

problem caused by genetic defect, traumatic injury, or disease; or psychosomatic,
due to some psychological factors of tension, stress or strain which, in a process
not yet clearly understood, affect the
ability to reproduce. Voluntary childlessness is usually used to refer to the decision
not to have children, and to a preference
for the childless state.

Specific cases, however, may be very
difficult to classify. For example, a couple
may claim to be voluntarily childless and
use elaborate birth control techniques to
prevent conception even though, ironically
enough, they are unknowingly sterile. It is
possible that some of the psychological
factors which lead to a preference for the
childless state may be the same factors
which lead to psychosomatic sterility. Conversely, it is always possible that the
inability to conceive leads to the effective
rationalization that conception was not
desirable in any case. Sterility, except in
the case of surgical alteration of the
reproductive organs, is not usually an
absolutely definite state, but refers to
relative degrees of subfecundity. A number
of women who do not conceive could be
made fertile through relatively simple
medical techniques. If medical facilities
are available, and they choose to do
nothing about their subfecundity, they are
in a sense childless by choice.

In spite of the difficulty in making precise distinctions between these two types,
there is some consensus in the literature
that “Voluntary childlessness is virtually
extinct . . . and .. . fecundity impairments are now the chief cause of childlessness” (Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966, p. 163; Population Reference
Bureau, 1966, p. 279). This represents a
change from the recent past. During the
1940’s it was estimated that nearly onefifth of all white couples remained childless and that as many as one-half of these

may have been childless by choice (Whelpton and Kiser, 1950, p. 336). Compared
with whites, nonwhites were less effective
in their use of birth control and less
motivated to limit the size of their families.
The high rates of childlessness have
generally been attributed to the fact that
thirty years ago, urban nonwhites had a
relatively high rate of venereal disease.
Significant improvements in the control of
venereal disease were introduced in the
1940’s and were followed by a marked
reduction in nonwhite childlessness (Kiser,
1948; Lunde, 1965; Campbell, 1966; Farley, 1970; Williams, 1970).

TRENDS IN CHILDLESSNESS

Since the early 1940’s, the proportion of
wives remaining childless has steadily declined for all ages.? If the incidence of

8 Statistics concerning rates of childlessness are
relatively difficult to obtain, since most research

childlessness were relatively constant over
time, we would expect that the proportion
of wives who remain childless would decrease with age until about the age of 45,
at which time the proportion would remain
approximately constant. The longer a
woman was married and exposed to the
risk of pregnancy, the more likely she
would be to have at least one child. This
expectation is not supported by the data. It
will be noted in Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5 that
young women from ages 20 to 30 consistently have a lower rate of childlessness
than older women over 30, even when the
factor of marriage duration is held constant. Later census data provides even
more dramatic contrasts. For example,

on natality is concerned with group variation,

and presents results in terms of birth rates and
average family size. One exception is Natality
Statistics Analysis United States—1962, which
provides detailed information on selected cohorts
from 1876-1880 to 1944-1948 (National Center
for Health Statistics, 1964, p. 66-67).

among women ever-married aged 30-34
“the proportion of childlessness has
dropped by two-thirds from 23% in 1940
to 17% in 1950 to 10% in 1960 to
7% in June, 1964” (Population Reference
Bureau, 1966, p. 67).

Although all the rates of childlessness
are dropping, there is evidence that the
decline has been even more rapid for nonwhites than for whites and that this trend
will continue. For example: “In 1962,
childlessness among nonwhite women aged
30-34 was 22.6%. In 1964, the rate of
childlessness was only 9%, a sharp drop
of more than half in two years” (Population Reference Bureau, 1966, p. 70).

CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY

In the past, childlessness has been more
common among nonwhites than among
whites. There is some evidence that, although voluntary childlessness was not uncommon among whites, a large part of
nonwhite childlessness was attributable to
the relatively high incidence of venereal
disease. Since the 1940’s, the incidence of
all kinds of childlessness has declined

sharply. However, with the virtual disappearance of voluntary childlessness among
whites, and with increased control of venereal disease among nonwhites, the decline
in childlessness has been much more rapid
among nonwhite couples, until, for the
younger cohorts, childlessness is actually
more common among whites than nonwhites.

Kunz and Brinkerhoff support their
hypothesis of a cultural belief in lower
nonwhite childlessness by referring to the
perceptions of a group of university undergraduates. It seems possible that university
students would be most familiar with
young couples married for only a short
time and would tend to make their estimates of the incidence of a phenomenon
with reference to this group. If this is the
case, their perception that young nonwhites
have a lower rate of childlessness than
young whites is in fact accurate.
