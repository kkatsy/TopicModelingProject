ABSTRACT: The breastfeeding of U.S. infants born in 1974-76 is analyzed using data from the
1976 National Survey of Family Growth. It is found that the proportion of infants breastfed was
increasing rapidly, with the highest rates found among white, college-educated, western mothers and lowest rates among black mothers and mothers with less than a high-school education.
For children who were breastfed, the median duration was about 4.5 months and the mean 5.5
months, also with marked differences by ethnicity, education, and region. Data from other
sources confirm these differences and quantify subsequent increases in breastfeeding.

The 1976 National Survey of Family
Growth (NSFG II) solicited fertility and
family planning information for a
weighted, nationally representative
sample of 8,611 single and ever-married
women ages 15-49 (about 88 per cent of
identified eligible women). Part of the
information collected related to the duration that each of the respondent's children was breastfed. The proportions
breastfed among children born in 197375 were reviewed in a recent report by
Hendershot (1980). He found an overall
increase from about 25 per cent
breastfed in the 1973 birth cohort to 35
per cent in 1975, with the highest rates in
both periods among white children and
children whose mothers had completed
more than 12 years of schooling.

This report will examine the proportions ever breastfed in greater detail and
present life table estimates of the proportion of children breastfed by duration since birth (/,), and mean breastfeeding durations (e,). Some findings of
the Ross Laboratories studies from 1955
to 1981 (Martinez and Nalezienski,

53

1979, 1981; Martinez et al., 1981; Martinez and Dodd, 1983), and Hirschman
and Hendershot’s (1979) and Hirschman and Butler’s (1981) results from
two earlier national fertility surveys in
1965 and 1973 (NSFG I) will also be reviewed. Among its other contributions
the NSFG II provides an opportunity to
measure response biases in the Ross
studies which draw from larger samples
than NSFG II but employ mailed questionnaires with about a 40 per cent nonresponse rate.

The significance of breastfeeding for
infant health, its contribution to postpartum amenorrhoea, and conversely,
the-influence of oral contraceptives on
its continuance, are competently reviewed elsewhere (Baer and Winikoff,
1981; McCann et al., 1981). In the
United States breastfeeding is rarely
used as a means for prolonging birth intervals, and the questions of most concern are relationships between currently
used oral contraceptive regimens and
quality and quantity of breast milk for
which the evidence remains inconclusive.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The life tables reported are constructed by standard cohort table methods. The proportion of a sample of children still being breastfed at time x is

measured as the product of the series of

terms ,p, from birth to duration x,
where each term represents the proportion of children breastfeeding at durationa + n,!

To compare life tables for children of
mothers in various attribute categories,
generalized Wilcoxon tests are used, together with multiple classification analysis for continuation at selected durations, following Hirschman and Butler
(1981). Summary regressions combining
observations at durations 1-12 months
have also been produced, using
weighted least squares with dependent
variables

fOip = yiyg— P yy Mi =D bx + Cijs

where

. ={ 1;d;2i,0;>i
Mii 0;d;<i, 0;>i

The terms d; and 0; are the duration of
breastfeeding and observation time of
the j’th respondent, respectively, and n;
is the sample size at i. By including the
term /; = ¥ y;;/n; on the left hand side
of the model, the mean of the f(i;)
terms is made equal to 0 at all durations
i, avoiding the distorting effects of the
different magnitudes of the /; terms that
would otherwise be felt in combined in

terval regressions. Weights at each duration i are inversely proportional to the
variance of J, 07; = |; (1. —l) /n; to
correct for heteroscedasticity.

The variables that will be considered
include mother’s age at the birth, ethnicity, educational level, education by ethnicity, region of residence, size of place
of residence, and the child’s birth order.
The NSFG II also included information
on mother’s employment for most but
not all births, and on family incomes.
Neither is considered in this report since
reporting is less complete than for other
variables.” Findings are restricted to infants remaining with their mothers for at
least two months following delivery and
surviving as the survey date in January—
September 1976.

RESULTS
PROPORTION OF INFANTS BREASTFED

The Ross surveys, NSFG I and
NSFG II all point to an upturn in proportions of children ever breastfed, beginning in the early 1970's, after many
decades of slow decline. In the cohort
breastfeeding tables constructed by
Hirschman and Butler (1981), the decline is essentially continuous for mothers from the 1911-15 birth cohort to the
1946-50 birth cohort. Ross estimates are
similar to those of NSFG I for first births
(28 per cent in 1971 in the Ross studies,
as against 28 per cent in 1966~70 and 29
per cent in 1971-73 in NSFG I), but are
slightly above NSFG II estimates for
combined parities (for 1973, 29 per cent

Mothers were listed as employed if they
worked two or more months, a convention that
may distort employment/breastfeeding patterns.
Family incomes were not reported for about 40 per
cent of 1974-76 births.

versus 25 per cent; for 1974, 32 per cent
versus 31 per cent; for 1975, 36 per cent
versus 35 per cent). The closeness of
these figures suggests that any biases in
the Ross findings due to preferential
nonresponse rates among nonbreastfeeders are small.?

For 1974 through mid-1976 the proportion of surviving infants ever
breastfed from the NSFG II is shown in
Table 1, followed by life table continuation rates for women breastfeeding at
least briefly. Examining attribute categories, the proportion of infants ever
breastfed is more than twice as high
among white infants as among black infants (39 per cent versus 17 per cent in
1975-76), and three times as high for
mothers attending college as for those
with less than a high-school education
(56 per cent versus 19 per cent in 1975—
76). Differences are about equally sharp
by region, the highest rates being in
mountain and western states (56 per
cent) and the lowest rates in the south
(24 per cent). Northeastern and
northcentral states are intermediate. By
age, the highest proportions are mothers at ages 25-29 (44 per cent), followed
closely by mothers over 30 (39 per cent)

3Ross figures are for proportions of infants
breastfed while in hospital. Figures are slightly
lower at age 1 week, when most infants were at
home. The NSFG II figures are for children who
lived with their mothers at least two months following birth. These differences may have small effects on estimated rates for the two sources. The
NSFG II restriction of breastfeeding data to infants who lived with their mothers for two months
following the birth also precludes use of the Mosley estimate for mean breastfeeding duration,
found as the number of infants breastfed at interview divided by the number of births in the previous 12 months or the number of births restricted
to children who were breastfed at least briefly. The
Mosley formula was found to be quite robust in applications to World Fertility Survey data (Ferry
and Smith, 1983).

and more distantly by mothers under 25
(29 per cent). All of these differences
are statistically significant at the 0.01
level. By comparison with the proportions breastfeeding in 1974, only the
proportions among mothers with less
than a high-school education and southern mothers did not show an increase.
The overall increase, and subcategory
increases above 5 percentage points,
were significant with the exceptions of
increases for college-educated mothers,
those in the west, and those at parity
3+. Smaller changes were not significant. We caution that the 13 per cent
increase in the northeast from 1974 to
1975-76 is significant but probably also
exaggerated. Recognizing that categories overlap, the profile is one of high
breastfeeding rates among white, welleducated mothers, particularly in the
west, where two-thirds of white mothers
with some college education breastfed
both in 1974 and in 1975-76. In both
years rates among black and lesseducated mothers remained low.

The proportions breastfeeding were
also found to be higher in urban than in
rural areas (38 per cent versus 28 per
cent in 1975—76) and higher at parities 1—
2 (37 per cent in 1975-76) than at other
parities (29 per cent). The higher urban
than rural rates represent a turnabout
from the historical pattern (Hirshman
and Butler, 1981) of preferential abandonment of breastfeeding by urban
mothers.

A multiple classification analysis of
the factors most strongly influencing
breastfeeding in 1975 shows educational
level to be the strongest single predictor
of breastfeeding, followed by western
residence and white ethnicity, all with a
significance level of 0.001 or below.

levels for these variables remained stable with stepwise inclusion of additional
variables. The association of northeastern residence with breastfeeding was
also significant, at about the 0.02 level.
Remaining variables had probabilities
above 0.05. Age effects were found to
correlate strongly with education; the
simple correlation coefficient with educational level was r = 0.30. The absence
of an independent age effect in the regressions implies that age is significant
because the 25-29 motherhood cohort
was slightly better educated than younger or older mothers, a relationship supported by cross-tabulations of the two
variables.

The adjusted 7° for the regression was
14 per cent with education, western residence, and ethnicity included, rising by
less than 1 per cent with the introduction
of the remaining variables. The three
attributes—better education, western
residence, and white ethnicity—were
thus the principal predictors of the decision to breastfeed children born in the
1975 to mid-1976 period. Results for
1974 were similar. For comparison,
Ross studies found education also to
have been highly significant in 1971 and
1981, together with parity and urban/
rural residence. Findings from NSFG I
indicate that educational differentials
reversed around 1960, less-educated
women being more likely than bettereducated women to have breastfed their
children prior to that time. Ethnic differentials also reversed in the early
1960’s. By regions, the west had taken
the lead by about the mid 1950’s, though
proportions breastfeeding continued to
decline there as elsewhere to about 1980
(Hirschman and Hendershot, 1981).

In our regression analysis the effects
of residence were largely absorbed in regional effects. Sample sizes may have

 

 

Breastfeeding in the United States 57

been too small to separate parity effects
from those of education and ethnicity.

Reviewing 1971-81 changes, the proportion of mothers with less than a college education who breastfed their children increased from 19 per cent to 51
per cent over the decade, while the proportion among college-educated mothers rose from 42 per cent to 74 per cent.
The NSFG II figures for 1975 through
mid-1976 births are 26 per cent and 56
per cent, respectively, and imply that
the absolute narrowing of educational
differentials only began after middecade. A 1979 CDC survey of U.S.
Mexican border counties (Smith et al.,
1982) and unpublished data for west
Texas suggest that proportions breastfeeding also remain low among Hispanic mothers, about 25 per cent in 1983
among Del Rio mothers participating in
the regional family planning program,
and 10-25 per cent in the CDC sample.
The rates are below those for other U.S.
women, and far below the World Fertility Survey estimate of 80 per cent of
Mexican mothers breastfeeding (Ferry
and Smith, 1983). Rates for 1981 also remain substantially lower for blacks than
for whites (G. Martinez, personal communication). It is possible that both
blacks and Hispanics will largely catch
up in the current decade, a trend already
underway among low-income mothers
participating in the federal WIC food
supplement program (Martinez and
Stahle, 1982).

Regional differences in breastfeeding
were first examined by the Ross laboratory investigators in 1978 and 1979 and
were highly significant in both years,
though narrower than the earlier NSFG
II estimates. In NSFG II the 1975-76
disparity between the south, with the
lowest proportions, and the west, with
the highest, stood at 31 percentage

points; in 1979, it stood at 22 points. The
Ross 1979 proportions breastfeeding
were 45 per cent, 46 per cent and 51 per
cent in the south, northeast, and
northcentral states, respectively, and 67
per cent in the west.

DURATION OF BREASTFEEDING

Besides the proportions initially
breastfeeding, Table 1 shows the proportions continuing at various durations
among ever-breastfed children in the
NSFG II sample who were born in 1974—
76 and were alive at interview. Figure 1
displays proportions graphically for the
total sample and a high (collegeeducated mothers) and slightly overlapping low subgroup (black mothers).
Small sample sizes discourage parameterization of the distributions, although
in the total sample about the same proportion of mothers cease breastfeeding
in one month as in the next, which suggests that the exponential may be a tolerable approximation over the first 12
months following childbirth.

The mean and median durations
roughly follow the pattern of proportions ever breastfed, breastfeeding
tending to continue longer in groups
with the highest proportions of starters
than in groups with smaller proportions
starting. Mean durations are not long
for any attribute groups, however. The
mean for the complete sample is only
5.5 months, with a range from about 3.0
months among black mothers with less
than a high school education, to 6.0
months among college-educated white
women who breastfeed. Even among
white, college-educated, western mothers, scarcely half breasted beyond 7
months, the mean being 7.5 months.
These estimates are crude, as sample
sizes are uniformly small by about the
sixth month. Characteristic of concave

Social Biology

survival distributions, the median durations are somewhat below the means for
all groups. In only a few categories do
the medians reach the 5-6 months of
breastfeeding that pediatricians recommend (Fomon et al., 1979). In paired
comparisons of the life table distributions using the generalized Wilcoxon
test (Lagakos, 1982), only differences
between black and white mothers, and
between mothers with less than a highschool education and mothers (especially in the west) with more schooling
were significant at the 0.05 level. Few
other differences were significant even
at the 0.1 level.

By contrast, in regression analyses
for selected single durations, and in the
combined interval regression, several
variables were significant at the 0.01
level or better. Asin the paired distribution tests, probabilities of continuing
were consistently higher and significant
for white, better educated, and western
mothers than for black and less educated mothers or mothers in other regions. At relatively long durations, the
somewhat low continuation rates of
northcentral mothers and higher rates of
mothers ages 25-29 were also significant. Urban/rural residence was significant in the combined regression
though inconsistent across single
months, while birth order was significant in several single months but not in
the combined regression. These findings
suggest that variables other than ethnicity, education, and region may be relevant to breastfeeding decisions, but at a
lower order of importance. About 7 per
cent of the variance in breastfeeding durations is explained by the combined set
of variables.

The Ross findings with respect to
proportions breastfeeding at various
ages in 1971, 1980, and 1981 indicate

that educational effects on durations of
breastfeeding have remained strong
throughout the decade, but are convergent. Mean breastfeeding durations for
college-educated women appear to be
stabilizing at levels near those of the
mid-1970s, while mean durations for
women with less education have continued to lengthen. The Ross studies also
affirm the crossover by parity seen in Table 1, whereby firstborn children are
more likely to be breastfed than later
children but are breastfed for shorter
durations. As the complete breastfeeding distributions are not currently available for either the Ross studies or NSFG
I, we are not able to trace other duration
changes over the decade.

SUMMARY

The 1976 National Survey of Family
Growth was conducted at a fortuitous
time with respect to American breast
feeding behavior. Whereas much of the
analysis of the 1973 NSFG I focused on
the decline in breastfeeding across successive cohorts of women, by 1976 a
very clear reversal was underway. The
reversal has necessitated a shift from cohort to period analysis as ethnicity, education, and residence rather than mothers’ ages have been the essential
predictors of the new pattern. By
1974-6 the number of women breastfeeding had become large enough for
NSFG II data to be meaningfully analyzed with respect to these predictor variables. Equally important, the data have
permitted at least preliminary checks on
the quality of Ross Laboratory surveys
for the same years and affirm their
unique value as a source of current
breastfeeding information.

Analyzed together, the NSFG and
Ross studies trace the reemergence of
breastfeeding among white, bettereducated, and—initially—western
mothers, after decades of gradual de

cline. The continuing increase in proportions of mothers breastfeeding nationwide, and the apparent stability
over several years in breastfeeding durations among the vanguard, may point to
its future course: breastfeeding becoming again the norm in the United States,
but terminating at relatively short durations. The change may confer modest
health benefits on current generations of
youngsters, although not benefits that
are easily measured, since human milk
substitutes are routinely subjected to
rigorous testing for nutritional adequacy.

Internationally, the resurgence of
breastfeeding in Western Europe

Social Biology

(World Health Organization, 1982) as
well as the United States may have 1mportant repercussions for the developing world. Urban and better-educated
women in most of the developing countries are currently less apt to breastfeed
their children than rural and lesseducated women, or to breastfeed for
substantially shorter durations. If widespread abandonment of breastfeeding—following the earlier American and European pattern—can be
avoided, it will be because Western
countries are providing a better model
than was available to them in the decades when their own formula consciousness was becoming established.
