“ABSTRACT: Demographic transition theory expectations notwithstanding, empirical analyses
Chave often observed higher fertility among nuclear than among extended households. A similar

ding has been observed consistently at all stages of the reproductive career among a sample of
Ghouseholds in Maharashtra, India, in 1970. Neither differential levels of natural fertility nor of
‘family-size preferences and use of fertility regulation, nor differential socioeconomic levels, can
Cexplain adequately the higher fertility of nuclear households. On the other hand, the evidence
o@uggests that the direction of causation is reversed, that is, that household type is itself a funcction of fertility and other life-cycle variables and also of space constraints on the household, and
~as such, is a better determinant of household type than a function of the latter.

erally extended) or of more than one
generation (vertically extended), or
both. Unlike the WFS and other classification schemes, the distinction between household types is not based on
couples. In the present classification
scheme, stem families such as, for example, a couple residing with a widowed
parent is considered extended, whereas
such a household is considered nuclear
in couple-based classification schemes
(Dandekar, 1967; Rodriguez, 1981).
Since, for example, the presence of a
widowed parent is expected to affect
considerably the reproductive behavior
of the young couple, it is appropriate to
classify such a household as extended.

 

Social Biology

It is clear from Table 1 that the average household in Maharashtra in 1970
was extended. Almost 40 per cent of
married women aged 15-44 resided in
nuclear households, and this proportion
increased steadily with age’. These distributions are to be viewed cautiously,

2Using the couple-based classification scheme
discussed above, an earlier study of Maharashtra
(Dandekar, 1967) observed that as many as 70 per
cent of all households with at least one couple were
nuclear in 1960. On the other hand, Conklin
(1968), using a classification scheme similar to that
used in this survey, finds that nuclear households
comprise about 50 per cent of all households with
at least one couple in Poona, an urban area of Maharashtra in 1963. In this light, the figure of 40 per
cent for rural and urban Maharashtra seems reasonable.

since extended households may include
more than one currently married
women in the reproductive ages who
would be eligible for interview (Rodriguez, 1981).

One obvious limitation of relating
household type, as defined, with fertility
is that household type is observed at one
point in time, that is, the time of interview. We are forced then to relate current residential status with lifetime fer
=tility experience, which raises the
“question of direction of causality. This
analysis will attempt to provide more
scomparable data on fertility wherever
Apossible, providing then, both lifetime
ccand recent fertility measures.

S A second limitation of this classificaction of household types is that it 1s based
<only on coresidential status. Such essenrctial features of household interaction as
Seconomic, emotional, and decision‘omaking relations may not be adequately
represented in such a classification
‘scheme, and the possibility of a bias

RESULTS

FAMILY SIZE BY HOUSEHOLD TYPE

Downloaded b

Demographic transition theory expectations notwithstanding, empirical
analyses have often observed higher fertility among nuclear households than
among extended households in less developed countries (see, for example,
Nag, 1965; Rele, 1963; Rodriguez,
1981). A similar finding is observed in
Maharashtra and presented in Table 1.
It is clear, for example, that at all ages,
women residing in nuclear households
have higher lifetime fertility than those
in extended households. In particular,

 

Household Type and Family Size 93

among young women at the initial stages
of family building, nuclear households
have 59 per cent more births and 62 per
cent more surviving children than do extended households. At older ages,
women in extended households tend to
catch up and have about 15 per cent
fewer children born and surviving than
do women in nuclear households.

Recent fertility refers to the number
of surviving children born to married
women in the last five years. Among the
youngest women, those residing in nuclear households have had an average of
1.25 children in the last five years, about
38 per cent more than women in extended households. In contrast, among
the older women, there is essentially no
difference in recent fertility by household type.

In conclusion then, when all women
are considered, women in nuclear
households have significantly higher
lifetime fertility than women residing in
extended households. When this relationship is considered separately for
each broad age group, the distinction is
significant at all ages for lifetime fertility, but only for the youngest women
when recent fertility is considered.

The demographic literature has offered several explanations for the higher
fertility observed among nuclear households; four of these hypotheses are examined below along with the data available for Maharashtra.

1. Higher Natural Fertility—Nag
(1965) has observed that nuclear households have greater privacy and are more
likely to break down traditional abstinence taboos, resulting in increased frequency of intercourse and thereby
higher natural fertility than exists
among extended households. Since direct evidence regarding frequency of intercourse and abstinence are not availaDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

94 Jejeebhoy

ble, this hypothesis may be examined by
an analysis of natural birth intervals in
Maharashtra. Since the data include
only ages of surviving children, conventional birth intervals cannot be computed. Therefore the birth interval refers to the interval between two
surviving children and will include, by
definition, a component of infant and
child mortality.

Table 2 presents life table estimates
of the proportion of women at each age
entering surviving parities 1, 2, and 3
(see Hobcraft and Rodriguez, 1980).
Generally there are no consistent differences in the lengths of these birth intervals by household type at any age. When
a similar analysis is performed on the
most recent closed surviving birth interval, again there is little difference by
household type. In Maharashtra then,
there is no evidence that the natural fertility of nuclear households is higher
than that of extended households.

2. Family Size Preferences and Regulation of Fertility—The hypothesis may
be raised that while women residing in
extended households are expected to
have more traditional views regarding
large ideal family sizes, they are also
more likely to have experienced pressure in terms of space and resources
(Rodriguez, 1981) and are hence forced
to modify their family-size preferences.
Therefore, their lower fertility may be
explained by their lower desired family
size. Table 3 reveals that women in nuclear households are about as aware of
fertility regulation methods as those in
extended households; but, contrary to
the above hypothesis, are somewhat
more likely to have ever practiced and
currently practice deliberate fertility
regulation.

3. Socio-Economic Factors Underlying Both Household Type and
Fertility.—There is a great deal of evi
 

Social Biology

dence which suggests that household
type is a function of certain social and
economic variables, and therefore both
household type and fertility are jointly
determined by the latter. For example,
land holdings and caste were found to be
significant determinants of household
type in Mysore (Lakshmi Narayan,
1969), as well as of fertility. Similarly,
education of the head of household is
found to affect both household type
(Handwerker, 1973) and fertility. The
hypothesis is raised then that household
type and fertility may be related merely
as a result of their individual associations with other social and economic
variables.

Correspondingly, in this study,
household type by education of both
spouses, and by fertility, standardizing
for each spouse’s education level in
turn, are considered. Firstly, there is little difference in the levels of education
at each household type. For example, at
ages 15-24, 58 per cent and 57 per cent
of women residing in extended and nuclear households, respectively, have had
any formal education. The corresponding proportions for the 25-34 year olds
are 51 per cent and 50 per cent respectively; and for the oldest women, 45 per
cent and 40 per cent respectively. When
husband’s education is considered,
again, the distinction is minor, except
for the oldest women whose husbands
tend to be somewhat better educated if
they reside in extended households (79
per cent with any education) than if they
reside in nuclear households (70 per
cent with any education). Among younger women, the distinction again is minor (at ages 15-24, 82 per cent and 80
per cent; at ages 25-34, 80 per cent and
77 per cent respectively). As expected
then, when children ever born and surviving and recent fertility by household
type are standardized for education, the

standardized means essentially resemble the unstandardized means presented
in Table 1. The higher fertility of nuclear
families cannot then be explained by the
indirect effect of education.

4. Reverse Causality: Effect of Fertility on Household Type.—It has been argued that the effect of fertility on household type may be more powerful than
the opposite effect discussed thus far. It
is clear, firstly, that age patterns of mortality and fertility to an extent constrain
the availability of household type alternatives. In other words, an older
woman, who is on the average multiparous and has been married longer, is less
likely to have a surviving stock of vertical relations (Conklin, 1968) with whom
to reside and is therefore more likely to

reside in a nuclear household, merely on
the basis of her stage in the life-cycle.
Freedman’s (1981) approach minimizes
this problem by examining only those
families whose stock of vertical kin are
available.

Secondly, even among couples at
identical stages of the life-cycle, Rele
(1963) has argued that there will be a
tendency for those with more surviving
children to live in nuclear households, as
a result of physical constraints that is,
space and crowding. Consequently,
higher fertility couples will be motivated
to form a nucleus away from the extended household.

Rodriguez (1981) provides evidence
from four societies showing that current
coresidential patterns are associated
 

Vol. 31, No. 1-2

with the woman’s current stage in the
life cycle. In this pattern, nucleation of
families increases with parity and duration of marriage until later stages in the
life-cycle when women again tend to reside in extended families, possibly as a
result of married children joining their
parents’ household.
These arguments imply that life-cycle
components such as age, duration of
marriage, and family-size proxy for
= s availability of vertical and horizontal kin
‘and particularly for the mortality of the
2 vertical generation on the one hand, and
Ophysical constraints as determined by
Ahigher fertility or larger family size on
the other. Table 4 presents the distribuS tion of women by household type, brocoken down by age group, duration of
#gmarriage, and number of surviving children.
60 Firstly, a positive association is ob‘Oserved between age and the proportion
of nuclear households. At the youngest
2 ages, that is, among recently married
“= women, the majority reside in extended
© households (85.2 per cent); this propor‘Etion declines to 66.9 per cent among
women aged 25-34 and 45 per cent
among the oldest women. If the cross3 -2 sectionally observed age pattern is held
Eto approximate the life-cycle pattern,
5 the evidence supports the argument that
A the process of nucleation of households
is largely explained by mortality among
the available vertical kin (see, for example, Conklin, 1968; Ryder, 1975).
Secondly, within each broad age
group, women who have been married
longer and who have larger numbers of
surviving children are more likely to reside in nuclear households. Unlike Rodriguez’s results, there is a systematic increase in the proportion of nuclear
households, such that, for example,
among young, newly married women,

Michi

Household Type and Family Size 97

only 5 per cent reside in nuclear households, whereas a peak of 63 per cent nuclear households is reached among the
oldest women who have been married at
least 25 years and have five or more living children.

Finally, at each age, Table 4 shows
that even when parity is controlled,
women with longer durations of marrlage are progressively more likely to reside in nuclear households. Conversely,
even when duration of marriage is controlled, higher parity women are progressively more likely to reside in nuclear households. This is seen in a
somewhat different manner in Table 5S,
where children ever born and surviving
are presented by household type and
standardized for duration of marriage.
In this case, at each age, the differentials
between the fertility of extended and
nuclear households narrows but continues to be significant for the youngest
and oldest women, implying some independent selection of high parity women
into nuclear households.

In conclusion then, the evidence presented in Tables 4 and 5 supports the argument that household type is a function
of stage in the life-cycle. More specifically, fertility, which represents an index of both stage of the life-cycle as well
as space constraints on the household, is
a better determinant of household type,
rather than a function of the latter, as
defined in this study.

CONCLUSIONS

Within the limitations imposed by a
narrow definition of household type and
by the lack of a residential history, the
following conclusions may be drawn
from this analysis of household types
and fertility in Maharashtra. Firstly,
life-time fertility, measured in terms of

higher fertility of nuclear households. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

On the other hand, the evidence supports the hypothesis that the direction of
causation is reversed, that is, that household type is a function of fertility and
other life-cycle variables. More particularly, among couples at the same stage
of the life-cycle, that is, when both age
and duration of marriage are controlled,
higher fertility couples are more likely
to reside in nuclear households.

This paper is part of an IIPS supported
project on the determinants of fertility in selected Indian states. I am grateful to S.
Kulkarni, S. Mukerji, and K. Srinivasan for
comments; to Mahesh Naik for programming assistance; and to Rama Narayan and
Surekha Vaishampayan for typing. Thanks
are also due ICSSR for making the data
available.
