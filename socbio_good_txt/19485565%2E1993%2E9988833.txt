SS ABSTRACT: This paper considers the assumption that there are widespread sex differentials in the
‘<household allocation of food in South Asia. From primary field data and a critical review of the
Vexisting literature, it concludes that we have no reason to believe that girls in this region
Linvariably get an unfair deal in the matter of nutrition, even in those areas where sex differentials
ooin child mortality are the most acute. Too much of the research to support such a contention
© starts with the biased view that gender differences in nutritional status must exist. It is pointed
stout in this paper that a new look at this issue is essential if we are to use scarce resources most
“effectively to fight gender inequalities. By identifying more precisely the areas in which women
are worst discriminated against, action to affect these areas can be focused much better than by

‘=Spreading efforts into programs where the need is at best marginal.

ws
= In recent years, there has been a
S growing awareness that the household

“ais not necessarily the best unit of analpysis in social science research. This is
‘Zbecause, just as there exist intrasociSetal differences in various aspects of
Sbehavior and welfare, the household
‘>too is not homogeneous. Different
"members face very different opportunities and constraints depending on
Stheir status as defined by a range of
2 characteristics. Indeed, so powerful
Qhas been this new awareness that we
almost seem about to swing completely
the other way, denying the existence of
any kind of common family or household interests. While such a complete
swing would again be self-defeating,
this new focus on household members
as separate individuals has still served
an essential purpose in identifying
more clearly the high-risk groups, that
is, those most urgently in need of attention.

 

Gender is now held to be one important determinant of intrahousehold
differentials in welfare. Age is the
other factor most commonly considered, but on the whole it seems to be
the case that differences by sex are
more severe than those by age. Moreover, age differentials are less invidious in a sense because, at least in principle, all individuals go through the less
favorable as well as the more favorable
ages over their life cycle. Gender on
the other hand is not a life cycle stage,
and the disadvantages associated with
it are faced only by one group.

Differentials by sex have been demonstrated to exist in access to several
resources, ranging from those necessary for the leading of a full life to those
necessary for survival itself. Inequality
in the latter set of resources is particularly stark in South Asia, where sex
differentials in mortality fly against all
biological theories of sex-determined

hardiness (see, among others, Visaria,
1967; El Badry, 1969; D’Souza and
Chen, 1980; Kynch and Sen, 1983).
However, while mortality differentials
can be measured relatively easily,
there is less known about sex differentials in other aspects of physical well
being.

One of the factors related to physical welfare which has been regularly
suggested in the literature is a gender
differential in the intrahousehold allocation of food in cultures where
women have a generally subordinate
role. For example, UNICEF has a very
potent photograph in its files. It depicts
an Indian mother with two young
children—one a bonny smiling boy and
the other a wide-eyed girl ravaged by
extreme malnutrition. So powerful is
the visual impact of this photograph
that it has been used by several private
and official agencies in their attempts
to influence the serious gender imbalance in the nutritional treatment of
children which is believed to exist in
much of South Asia.

But how representative is this picture? The answer to this question is important for two reasons. In the first
place, we need to know where the focus of our attention should be in the
attempt the redress the several gender
inequalities which exist in the developIng countries in general and the South
Asian region in particular. Should we
concentrate most on the relative nutritional deprivation of girls? Or on the
inequality in their access to welfare services such as in health? Or on the rampant discrimination that they face in
the labor market? Resources being
limited, the more they are scattered,
the less effective they will be. There is
thus much to be gained at a practical

Social Biology

level by a greater confidence in the belief that girls invariably get the worse
end of the nutritional stick.

Second, and as important, we need
an answer to this question so that
blame can be more fairly placed. The
recipients of this blame are the parents
(and, by extension, other household
members) who are believed to acquiesce in, often even encourage, and
perhaps themselves act out a day-today discrimination in the allocation of
household resources to girls. While it is
true that it is being increasingly recognized that household behavior is an important determinant of health (see, for
example, Caldwell, 1979; Caldwell et
al., 1983; Basu, 1987), such behavior
has several manifestations and not all
of them are equally relevant in different situations. Accusing the household
of everyday and conscious denial of
enough food to a female child is a serious charge which deserves greater
support with actual evidence.

Discrimination in the use of health
services is one thing. One can attribute
less ulterior motives, such as a greater
panic in a male child’s illness or a
greater cultural inhibition about having a girl examined by a male doctor, to
the possibility of there being a callous
disregard for the girl child’s welfare
(Basu, 1990). Similarly, when girls are
kept out of school more often than
boys, a kinder explanation can include
the fears and insecurity felt about sending young girls to a faraway school. But
in the case of food allocation, one runs
out of such charitable excuses and must
conclude instead that callousness toward girls and/or the self-interest of
parents is/are such large considerations
that they allow girls to be consistently
underfed while their brothers gorge. It
Vol. 40, No. 1-2

is this kind of reasoning that prompted
Miller (1981) to conclude that ‘“‘nutritional and medical deprivation go hand
in hand with deprivation in love.”

In this paper I therefore attempt a
critical review of the evidence on the
relatively greater nutritional deprivation of girls in South Asia. I examine
both indirect and direct evidence and
rely on both primary and secondary

INDIRECT EVIDENCE

The literature abounds in this kind
of evidence. The usual practice is to infer from the well-established sex differential in mortality, especially in childhood, that there must be and are
corresponding sex differentials in feeding habits, especially in childhood.

But why should we accept this inference? Malnutrition is but one of the
possible precursors to death and, if

Nutritional Levels 27

recent research is to be _ believed,
not nearly as important as originally
thought. For example, I (Basu, 1989),
concluded from a review of the available data that it is not necessary to use
household discrimination in the allocation of food to explain sex differentials
in child mortality in India. The case
seems to be much stronger for household discrimination in the allocation of
health care once an illness has struck.
In the primary data employed in that
paper, North Indian children were
found to show marked differences in
favor of boys in both mortality and
health care, whereas in the case of nutritional levels, if anything, girls did
somewhat better than boys.

Similarly, Aaby (1988), in a thesis
which is gradually gaining acceptance,
pleads that we return to “transmission’”’ factors, as opposed to “‘host”’ factors, to explain differentials in the mortality risks faced by different groups
from several infectious illnesses. In recent years, with the increased stress on
nutritional status, factors such as overcrowding to explain illness severity
have gone unnecessarily out of fashion.
This variable can, for example, explain
a substantial link between fertility and
child mortality in poor populations.
Historically, Wrigley (1969) would attribute the higher urban mortality
during the Industrial Revolution in
Europe to the population density increases associated with urbanization
rather than to industrialization per se
or to worse nutrition; for instance, the
mortality in slums in large cities (which
were more often commercial rather
than industrial centers) was significantly higher than in industrial areas
where people lived in relatively small
villages and towns.

In the context of the role of the external environment in gender differentials in mortality, Aaby (1988) would
interpret the sex differential in measles
mortality in Bangladesh (with girls dying more often than boys) as being
caused at least partly by differences in
lifestyle between the two sexes. He
postulates that the severity of an infectious illness is affected by the intensity
of exposure, which in the traditional
South Asian context is likely to be
greater for girls. Girls are more likely
to stay at home and therefore more
likely to be what are known as secondary cases, that is, cases that have become infected from another household
member, as opposed to index or primary cases which have been exposed
to infection from a relative outsider
such as a school companion. Since one
spends more time with other household members than with outsiders, it is
hypothesized that secondary cases face
a greater intensity of exposure to and
thus severity of infection. And if this
greater severity is in turn also handled
less effectively than an illness in boys,
one can see that the chances of a disease being more often fatal in girls are
greatly increased.

Finally, we have the indirect evidence of the kind which reasons that if
some kinds of household discrimination (for example, in health care) by
sex exist, it 1s likely that other kinds
(for example, in nutrition) exist as
well. However, different kinds of discrimination can have their roots in
quite different motivations, as discussed earlier.

The point from the indirect evidence therefore is that we cannot make
any automatic connection between sex
differentials in mortality (or, for that

 

Social Biology

matter, in other aspects of welfare) and
sex differentials in nutritional status.
There are too many other more potent
possibilities and to draw any firm conclusions on unequal access to food by
boys and girls, we need more direct
data, to which I now turn.

DIRECT EVIDENCE

To look at the primary data first, Tables 1 and 2 suggest that there is little
reason to believe that severe malnutrition is significantly higher in girls than
in boys. The data are from a field study
of cultural influences on demographic
behavior conducted by the author
among a North Indian (from eastern
Uttar Pradesh) and a South Indian
(from Tamil Nadu) group living in the
common physical environment of a
Delhi slum (Basu, 1992). This study involved retrospective as well as longitudinal data collection from households,
with a special focus on the health and
mortality of children. Height and
weight measurements of children below the age of twelve were converted
into nutritional levels using the sexspecific standards of the U.S. National
Center for Health Statistics (World
Health Organization, 1983; for further
details, see Basu, 1989).

From Tables 1 and 2, it appears
that, on the whole, severe malnutrition
was greater in the North Indian boys
than in the girls, while in the Tamil
Nadu case, the boys had a slight edge
over girls. This result is in direct contradiction to that expected from indirect inferences in the literature. But
such an absence of clear gender differentials in childhood nutritional levels
has also come out in several other
studies (see, for example, Chaudhury,

1984; Chaudhury, 1987; Nutrition
Foundation of India, 1988; Visaria,
1988), and once it becomes less awkward to take this neutral stand, perhaps more such studies will gain publicity.

We also have some (though admittedly approximate) data on sex differ
 

entials in actual food consumption.
Since these data were obtained by the
method of previous day’s recall by the
mother, it would be unwise to set too
much store by them, but the overall
impression seems to be that in the Uttar Pradesh sample, girls did have a
slightly better diet than boys in the case

of some choice foods such as fruit and
eges (although they did somewhat
worse on milk consumption), while for
the Tamil sample, there was little to
choose from between the sexes as far as
food intake was concerned. Perhaps
one should add that this picture is not
the result of favoritism toward girls in
the northern sample but probably reflects circumstances such as a greater
presence at home, which increases the
access of girls to food, especially to
snacks.

Nonetheless, the researcher working with small intensive samples feels
more secure if secondary data support
(or at least do not contradict) the results obtained. I therefore now turn to
a critical review of the existing knowledge in this area and conclude that the
case in favor of the selective nutritional
deprivation of girls is far from made.

To begin with the ethnographic literature, Miller (1981) did an extremely
painstaking search of the literature in
this context, so I think that we can assume that her evidence is the best that
this literature has to offer. Her first
conclusion is that the subject of sex differentials in feeding patterns has been
virtually ignored by ethnographers.
While this could indeed reflect a preoccupation with other topics by ethnographers, one wonders if the scant
attention is at least partly because field
researchers have found so little to report. One hopes that the anthropologist who sees consistent underfeeding
of girls vis-a-vis boys in a society would
find this topic sufficiently interesting to
explore. I think that my argument here
is similar to Miller’s argument that
since the anthropological literature on
North India is replete with descriptions
about the joy experienced at the birth

Social Biology

of a son while that on South India is
not, this lack of descriptions means
that such excessive joy is less present in
the South.

The result is that although Miller
(1981) devotes much more space to
feeding differentials by sex than to differentials in health care, she is on much
weaker ground in the former case. For
example, the evidence on breastfeeding can affect both nutrition and mortality in either direction, depending on
the circumstances. For instance, the
(slightly) younger age at which girls
have the annaprasan ceremony (which
marks the introduction of solid foods)
in some parts of India could mean that
there is a greater hurry to get them off
the breast, but it must also be mentioned that this ceremony simply heralds the cessation of total breastfeeding
while partial breastfeeding still continues. Its practical result may well be that
girls now get a more balanced diet than
boys. For example, in the Morinda
study, Levinson (1972) found that in
upper-caste households, fully weaned
girls and semi-weaned boys showed little difference in total nutrient intake.

So many possible interpretations
means that the mother suspected of
discriminating against her daughters in
food often faces a no-win situation (for
example, see Pettigrew, 1986). If the
daughter is breastfed longer than the
son, it is because the mother (or parents, or grandmother) does not want to
spend money on other food; if she is
breastfed for a shorter while, it is because breastmilk is considered more
important for boys.

Finally, the anthropological studies
from South India which describe the
fine food given to girls at menarche
should really be treated more as the
 

Vol. 40, No. 1-2

observation of a ritual than overall
preferential feeding of girls over boys.

There are other pitfalls in giving too
much weight to such descriptive or anecdotal evidence, the main one being
the problem of biased samples. This
problem is well illustrated in Pettigrew

(1986), where the author talks of the

positive discrimination toward a son

and the negative discrimination against
‘° the youngest daughter in a family with
& one son and four daughters. But this is
surely an atypical case. In the kind of
& poor household she is describing, one
9 also suspects that the youngest would

< there is a birth-order effect and a sex— composition effect firmly entangled in
“the sex-preference effect we are con= cerned with.

Coming to more quantitative findings, the evidence is once more not as
I 2 inoguivocal as it appears at first glance
zor as it would appear if one went by a
z “WHO review of the area (World
2 Health Organization, 1986). Footnote

>the biased stand from which it prosg ceeds: “Studies cited in this review are
thus by definition limited mainly to
those that have found evidence of dise crimination; studies that have found no
A such differences are therefore not men
tioned here.” Apparently, this has

been done to “convey a sense of urgency of the problem.” The logic of
this stand is puzzling. You can hardly
point to the gravity of, say, a water
shortage in a region by singling out the
six homes with no water and ignoring
the dozens that have more water than
they know what to do with.

To take the quantitative evidence
of breastfeeding first, most studies re
Michigan

Nutritional Levels 31

port no significant sex differentials in
duration (for example, Wyon and Gordon, 1971; Huffman et al., 1980). Jain
and Bongaarts (1981), in an analysis
of World Fertility Survey data from
eight countries (including Bangladesh,
where sex differentials in mortality are
high), found no evidence of longer du
tation of breastfeeding of boys than of

girls, in spite of the fact that there is
some suggestion in the literature that
birth intervals are shorter after a girl
than after a boy. In fact, this finding
was used to infer (wrongly, as it appears from more direct data) shorter
breastfeeding for girls. In any case, it
must be stated that even if sex differentials in breastfeeding did exist, it
would be difficult to know how to interpret their connection with final nutritional levels.

The mean lengths of breastfeeding
in our field study are displayed in Table
3. I present durations separately for all
live births in the last ten years to female respondents in the study as well
as those for the current survivors of all
live births in the last ten years. Children under the age of one are not included in the calculations of mean
breastfeeding duration because so
many of them fall in the category of
“still breastfeeding,’’ as seen in the last
two columns of the table. It is interesting to note that, contrary to expectations, it is among the Tamilians that sex
differences in breastfeeding are more
heavily weighted against girls.

Next, there are field surveys which
take anthropometric measurements
and classify them with reference to a
standard such as the Harvard standard.
There is at least one more problem
with the interpretation of findings
from such field studies based on

be biased by the choice of reference

A Pradesh exhibit better nutritional status than boys. In fact, for most of the
age groups and for both measures
(weight for age as well as weight for
height), it is now the girls who seem
more severely deprived. And in the
Tamil sample, the earlier relatively
small disadvantage to girls is much
sharper now.

But there is at least one study which
used sex-specific standards to classify
its anthropometric measurements and

still found greater malnutrition in girls
than in boys in Matlab thana in Bangladesh (see Chen, 1982). Moreover,
an equally careful study on one subsample of this project even found that
females received less food than males
(Chen et al., 1981). While it may be
difficult to fault these findings on methodological grounds, one should consider the author’s cautionary note
(Chen, 1982) that the findings might
not be generalizable to other parts of
South Asia.

In fact, it is worth noting that once
the above food intake study had been
corrected for sex differences in dietary
requirements based on body mass,
physical activity, and the special needs
of the female reproductive cycle, it was
only for the age group 0-4 years that it
could be said with definiteness that the
shortfall in food intake was greater for
girls than for boys. This finding probably means only the group 1—4 years
fell short in food, since breastfeeding is
near universal and total in the first year
of life in these parts. Unfortunately,
this part of their finding has received

considerably less attention than their
demonstration of greater discrimination against girls in early childhood.
The little other evidence we have on
sex differences in the intra-household
distribution of food is again mixed (for
summaries, see Table 6 and also Harris, 1990 and Lipton, 1983). Two important points emerge repeatedly. The
first is that the more relevant distinction is probably the one between children and adults, although even the interpretation of the fact of greater
malnourishment among children has
problems given the overrepresentation
of children among the poor, that is,
among the malnourished (see Lipton,
1983). However, in our study, we
found that only in a small percentage of
cases were children not likely to be
among the first family members to be

fed (see Table 7). There was also a regional differential in this custom, and
in households from the southern state
of Tamil Nadu, children were given
first preference in virtually all cases.
Secondly, it appears that where actual discrimination against girls does
exist, it is more likely to begin in late
childhood or early adolescence as the
girl is socialized for the role of ideal
wife and mother (for Bangladesh, see
Rizvi, 1983). In India Appadurai
(1981) records that any sex discrimination in the gastropolitical roles prescribed for boys and girls tend to start
at about age five. But even at these
older ages, anthropometric data are
increasingly beginning to suggest that
we may be making an unduly strong
case in favor of a female disadvantage.
The actual evidence (see, for example,

strongly suggests that food imbalances
g are not a major part of the gender inE equalities in South Asia.

DISCUSSION

A variety of interlinked historical
and cultural reasons have been ad— vanced to explain the greater female
= disadvantage in survival, as well as in
- several other aspects of life, that char‘S acterizes the South Asian region in
‘= general and the north-western part of
this region in particular. These reasons
< include kinship patterns (for example,
E Karve, 1965; Dyson and Moore, 1983),
~ the nature of the bargaining position
of the sexes in the marriage contract
yz (Sen, 1987), women’s levels of eco"3 nomic activity (Schultz, 1978), and the
< extent to which wheat is the main ag= ricultural crop in a region (Bardhan,
© 1974; Miller, 1981).

The above factors explain some of
the conscious or unconscious motivations behind prevailing gender differences in welfare. At the same time, research attention in this area has tended
to be rather diffuse as far as the actual
inequalities are concerned. It is too
readily assumed that if women do
badly on one count, they must do badly
on all other counts as well. This as
n| at 13:45 08 Dece

sumption needs to be questioned for
more effective action against those
gender inequalities which actually exist
and which are amenable to change.

For example, because we start with
the assumption that food discrimination by sex does exist, much research
on this subject has been somewhat
overzealous in its attempt to document
such discrimination. In the process,
several methodological refinements
have been ignored which might suggest
that the situation is not quite so grim
after all.

The assumption that there is necessarily gender discrimination in the
household allocation of food in South
Asian societies has been questioned in
this paper. After a critical review of the
existing knowledge on this subject, it
has been concluded that there is no
clear picture. There may be a certain
amount of discrimination, but it is far
from being uniform even in those areas
which exhibit the largest sex differentials in child survival. In passing, it may
be mentioned that it would be interesting to do a similar review of the evidence on the greater nutritional deprivation of girls in the Middle East,
another region where gender differences in physical welfare are believed
to be marked.

If the analysis here has tended to
swing too much in the direction of

trying to suggest that sex differentials
in childhood nutritional levels are negligible or even nonexistent, it is perhaps the result of an attempt to redress
the balance in the existing literature.
The more accurate conclusion would
be that we do not know enough, and
that there is no uniform pattern of gender differentials in child nutritional status in South Asia. But a new look at old
data is essential so that we do not divert resources away from areas of life
and death where sex differences in welfare are genuinely important and urgently in need of change.
