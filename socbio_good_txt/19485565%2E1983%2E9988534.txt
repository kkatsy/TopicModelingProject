Age of Mother and Pregnancy Outcome in

the 1981 Arkansas Birth Cohort

ABSTRACT: The relationship between the age of mother and pregnancy outcome is examined
using the matched birth—infant death data for Arkansas. Indicators of pregnancy outcome are
examined in relation to measures of SES and access to health care. The hypothesis that the
elevated rate of newborn mortality and morbidity among infants delivered by adolescents as a
consequence of biologic immaturity is examined. The analysis suggests that the higher levels of
obstetric risk observed among teenage mothers is an artifact of lower SES and inferior access to
health care and not biological immaturity as previously assumed.

During the past decade a vast body of
research has been conducted that deals
with some aspect of pregnancy and
childbearing among teenagers. In nearly
every instance these studies conclude
that teenage pregnancy results in problems for the teenage mother, her child,
and the larger society. Demographically, teenage fertility is associated with
higher rates of population growth, even
if completed fertility remains constant.
Coale and Tye (1961), Keyfitz (1968),
and Coale (1973) demonstrate the
mathematical relationship between the
mean age at fertility and intrinsic rates
of growth.

Aside from higher intrinsic rates of
growth, early entry into childbearing
typically produces shorter birth intervals and higher terminal parities (U. S.
Bureau of the Census, 1978). Presser
(1971) argues that women experiencing
pregnancy as a teenager are more likely
to become fatalistic about their ability to
limit family size and therefore are less
effective contraceptors.

Another facet of motherhood at a
young age is the impact that early preg
nancy has upon status attainment. A series of studies (Pohlman, 1968; Freedman and Combs, 1970; Hofferth and
Moore, 1979) have illustrated that early
pregnancy has a sustained negative impact on the accumulation of income
throughout marriage. Baldwin and Cain
(1980) argue that adolescent pregnancy
is related to higher levels of marital discord. Cohen et. al. (1980) presented
some tentative evidence that mental development is positively related to the
age of the mother.

The health consequences of adolescent pregnancy include higher rates of
malnutrition and prematureity (Siegal
and Morris, 1970). Early studies of the
relationship between maternal age and
infant and maternal mortality concluded
that the higher rates observed at each
end of the age distribution were the
result of biologic factors. Recently,
however, a number of researchers have
suggested that teenage pregnancy may
be associated with lower not higher \evels of maternal and obstetric problems
than is true of older women (Rothenberg and Varga 1981; NCDC, 1980;

NCHS, 1980). Baldwin and Cain (1980)
and Morris (1981) have pointed out that
the observed rates of newborn mortality
among teenage mothers is probably an
artifact of the higher levels of poverty
and inadequate health care common to
teenage pregnancy. Once the social and
economic factors have been controlled,
higher rates of mortality among neonates of teenage mothers disappear. It is
felt that the observed levels of mortality
among teenage mothers stems from
their social, economic, and health care
inequalities and not from innate biological immaturity.

What is the relative importance of the
three sets of factors as a determinant of
pregnancy outcome? Specifically, how is
pregnancy outcome related to age after
controls have been made for differences
in social status and differential access to
medical care? What are some of the implications that these relationships may
have on population and public health
policies? These are the major issues to
be addressed in the following analysis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data upon which this study is
based consist of matched Arkansas
birth-infant death records for 1978.

Mangold

Social Biology

These data include all of the information
contained in the standard vital statistics
forms as filed with the Arkansas Department of Health. As the data consist of
matched birth and infant death records,
it is possible to relate characteristics contained on either record. The resulting
data permit a detailed analysis of information contained on the infant death record with information on birth record.
In 1978 there were 36,341 births to residents of Arkansas. There were 479
deaths to the members of this birth cohort and of these, 477 were successfully
matched. Of the total number of births
11,810 were nulliparious women. Due
to the strong relationship between age
and parity and the confounding effects
that parity has on pregnancy outcome,
the analysis that follows will be restricted to these 11,810 births.

RESULTS

Table 1 presents the means for several indicators of pregnancy outcome by
age. It is well established that infants delivered by adolescents have a lower birth
weight than is true of older mothers.
Since there is a fairly strong association
between birth weight and prematurity,
the lower birth weight among the new

born delivered by adolescents is typically regarded as an indicator of biological immaturity.

The importance of low birth weight
also stems from the fact that there is a
strong association between birth weight
and neonatal mortality. As can be seen,
the youngest women—those under 16—
have babies that are about 240g under
the mean birth weight for mothers of all
ages. The second indicator is the month
of pregnancy that prenatal care was initiated. Again, adolescents have a negative departure from the overall mean.
Once care is initiated, the teenager has
fewer prenatal visits than is true of older
mothers. For each of the last two indicators, there is a perfect inverse rank correlation between age and access to
health care.

Both one- and five-minute Apgar
scores show that newborns delivered by
the youngest adolescents—those 15 and
under—have the lowest scores. It appears that by age 16, age has little impact
on these scores. The scores shown
closely parallel those recently published
by the National Center for Health Statistics (1981). The final, and the most
important indicator is the infant mortality rate. The rate of 17.8 observed
among women 15 and under is nearly 45
per cent higher than is true for mothers
over the age of 20. It is noteworthy that
the Jowest mortality rate is found among
infants delivered to adolescents aged 18
and 19.

Based upon the preceding, it appears
that childbearing among teenagers is related to higher Jevels of prematurity, depressed Apgar scores, reduced access to
health care and, at the youngest ages, elevated newborn mortality. To what extent are these findings the result of biological immaturity versus the social and
medical environment in which the preg

nant teenager finds herself? In order to
examine these relationships further, a
series of multiple regression analyses
were made taking each of the indicators
of pregnancy outcome as the dependent
variable. The independent variables
were divided into two categories—those
indicative of social and economic status
(race, education and marital status) and
those indicating health access (month
that prenatal care started and number of
visits). The correlation matrix upon
which these analyses were carried out is
displayed in Table 2 but will not be discussed further here.

Table 3 presents the results from the
multiple regression analyses. The table
presents the partial regression coefficients for each independent variable,
the intercept, and multiple R? and F for
each model. An examination of the multiple regression equation for birth
weight reveals that race is the only variable inversely related to birth weight.
That this slope is inverse is understandable given the white-black birth weight
differentials. The only surprise among
the health indicators is the positive association between the month that care
started and birth weight. It was expected
that this relationship would be negative.
Examination of the dummy variables
that represent age reveals that the partial slope for each adolescent category is
positively related with birth weight, and
not negatively as demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2.

Both the one- and five-minute Apgar
scores reveal that once the effects of social and health care access are controlled
there is no significant association between age and the score. The oneminute measure is the only score lowered as a result of an age effect, and this
is only true for the youngest teenagers.

The relationship between mortality

mortality as a dichotomy, the measure
of mortality used here is the reciprocal
of the interval from birth to death during
the infant period or first year following
birth.

This measure can be thought of as the
“force of mortality” experienced in the
first year of life. Among infants surviving the infant period the force of mortality is 0. Infants dying in the first 24 hours
arbitrarily have a force of mortality of 1.
Of the variables indicating social
status—marital status, education, and
race—two are significant. The force of
mortality is higher among neonates delivered by single and nonwhite mothers.

The proxy variables for health care
are both inversely related to the force of
mortality and are significant at
p=0.001. The dummy variables for age
show that the force of mortality is significantly Jower among the youngest and
oldest adolescents after the effects of
SES and health care access have been
removed. The partial slope of the
dummy representing 16-17 year olds is
positive but fails to achieve statistical
significance. Although some explanation for the reversal of the sign of the
slope for the dummy representing 16-17
year olds is needed, none can be found.

DISCUSSION

It is clear from the preceding that the
strength of association for each of the regression models is weak. The largest
multiple R? is but 0.08 birth weight and
is 0.05 or less for the remaining variables. Taken as sets of predictors, the
proxy variables for health access (month
care Started and number of visits) have
the strongest association with each of
the dependent variables. The indicators
of social status (education, race, and
marital status) have a weaker associa

birth weight, is replaced by a slight advantage. This advantage is observed
through the use of statistical controls
and will not be observed in the population at large unless there are changes in
the policies governing access to contraception, abortion, and health care by
adolescents—especially those at the
youngest ages.
