_-ABSTRACT: Through a series of life table analyses, this paper describes the natural history of tu=berculosis mortality in a Mexican-origin community over five decades (1935-84) during which
Sthe disease underwent a transition from a major underlying cause of death to a disease condi‘2Ationed mentioned more often on death certificates as contributing to death than causing death.
€The decline in death rates from 1940 to 1950 was especially remarkable. Successive birth cohorts
cof Mexican Americans, separated by as little as five years of age, experienced distinctly lower
Crisk of death from tuberculosis as they entered young adulthood. There was a rapid convergence
odin age-specific patterns of tuberculosis death rates in Mexican Americans toward those of nonHispanic whites, so that by 1960 tuberculosis was primarily a cause of death in old age rather than young adulthood. The impact of changing environment, both through improvements of
—conditions within neighborhoods and through residential mobility, on birth cohorts at risk of tu‘berculosis needs to be examined in further research.

natural history of tuberculosis mortality
in a Mexican-origin community over five
decades (1935-84) during which the disease underwent a transition from a major
underlying cause of death to a disease
condition mentioned more often on death
certificates as contributing to death than
causing death. Comparable results are
presented for the non-Hispanic white
population.! Descriptive analyses are also
presented of multiple cause data on the
role of tuberculosis as a contributing
cause, rather than an underlying cause.
These data are especially useful in illustrating the long-term transformation of
the disease in the populations of interest.

PREVIOUS WORK

There is an enormous literature on tuberculosis, and no attempt will be made
to review it here except with respect to
the Mexican-origin population in comparison with other populations. The high
levels of tuberculosis morbidity and mortality in the Mexican-origin population
were recognized early in this century, but
the coverage in the literature is scant,
probably because the population was concentrated in a few southwestern states,
mostly in counties not far from the
Mexico-United States border. Problems
of ethnic identification in the census and
vital statistics also hampered the investigation of tuberculosis in this population.

'Data for the African-American population are included in our data set, but they are not included in this
analysis because the percentage of the population is
small (about 6 to 8 per cent) as are the numbers of
deaths. In addition, the literature on tuberculosis in the
African-American population is already substantial.

Social Biology

Local public health officials in border
states from Texas to California were well
aware of the problem of tuberculosis in the
Mexican-origin population. In Texas, in
the late 1930’s, the tuberculosis death rate
for Mexican Americans was more than
twice that of non-Hispanic whites, but in
urban areas, such as San Antonio and
Houston, the death rate was approximately
seven times as great (Dublin, 1942). The
border regions of Texas, with high concentrations of Mexican Americans, experienced tuberculosis death rates that were
two to three times those of other regions in
Texas. In California, the tuberculosis death
rate for Mexican Americans was four
times that of the total white population
(Dublin, 1942). Dublin’s findings are consistent with those by Burns, (1938), who
reviewed data for Texas in 1930 and 1935,
Lopez (1944), who reviewed data for California in the 1940’s, and Werner (1940),
who described tuberculosis mortality rates
in New Mexico from 1935-39.

Tuberculosis was still a major cause of
death in the Mexican origin population in
the 1950s, at least in San Antonio and
Houston, for which Ellis (1959 and 1962)
coded and tabulated mortality records. In
both cities in 1950, male Mexican origin tuberculosis death rates were three times the
Anglo rates, and among females the differential was even greater. Data for Texas in
1980 show little difference in death rates
from tuberculosis as an underlying cause
between Mexican-origin and Anglo males,
but mortality of Mexican-origin women
was twice that of Anglo women.* |

In the 1980’s morbidity and mortality
data became more universally available
for Hispanics. Rieder et al. (1989) reported that tuberculosis incidence rates
among Hispanics in the United States
were more than four times those of nonHispanic whites (18.7 compared with 4.3
cases per 100,000 population, respectively). The authors also show that the

.wnumber of cases of tuberculosis among
SHispanics and other minority groups was
increasing compared with the non‘eHispanic white. While Rieder et al. do
Snot treat persons of Mexican origin sepaArately, it may be assumed that trends in
the broader Hispanic population reflect
<tuberculosis morbidity trends in that pop“ulation reasonably well.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA

The source of the tuberculosis mortalty data is original death certificates for
ersons who died in Bexar County (San
ntonio), Texas, during the years 19354, All death records for those years in
“the files of the San Antonio Metropolitan
Health District were made available to
Sthis project. Excluding a few duplicate
F certificates, there were a total of 284,543
Avalid records. The data from the Metro
politan Health District include all deaths

that occurred in San Antonio from

1935-65 and _ all deaths that occurred in

the entire county from 1966-84. Prior to

1966, deaths that occurred within Bexar

County, but outside the San Antonio city

limits, were registered in other jurisdic
tions in the county. Because nearly all
hospitals and other health care facilities
were located in San Antonio, the majority
of deaths to Bexar county residents living

outside the city limits are also included in
our file.

To adjust for any underrepresentation
of deaths in Bexar County, tabulations by

_age, sex, ethnicity, and cause of death

were inflated to equal the totals published
in the United States vital statistics reports. The difference in the project and
published counts for San Antonio reflects
intercounty and interstate reallocation of
death certificates for residents of San Antonio who died outside the city. For
Bexar County, the relative number of certificates unavailable for coding ranges
from a high of 20 to 25 per cent in the
1930’s and early 1940’s to a low of 4 to 8
per cent from 1968 onward. The close
correspondence in later years between the
Bexar County and San Antonio differentials in the last two decades reflects the
extension of the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District registration jurisdiction within Bexar County.

Bexar County is a community in
which large Mexican-origin and AngloAmerican populations have interacted for
many generations. It was chosen for a
general study of Mexican-origin mortality because virtually all of the resident
Hispanic population is of Mexican origin
(93 per cent in 1980). Local social and
economic conditions and characteristics
which may affect trends in mortality, and
therefore data for the Mexican origin
population of Bexar County, may not
necessarily produce measures that would
be exactly consistent with measures that
might be based on data for the Mexicanorigin population in the United States as
a whole (were such data available).

The data were coded systematically
for both demographic characteristics and
causes of death. Coding of cause of death
was carried out according to the Ninth

Revision of the International Classification of Diseases by nosological clerks
trained by personnel at the National Center for Health Statistics to do multiple
cause coding. All cause-of-death coding
was In accordance with all NCHS standards of quality and quality control.

There is some discontinuity in death
certificate design and terminology over
the fifty-year study period. Of particular
concern are differences between the certificates used before and after 1949. Prior
to 1949, information on the “primary” or
“principal” cause of death was asked. The
older certificates also included questions
about “contributory” causes. “Primary”
and “principal” causes are analogous to
the “underlying” cause requested on later
certificates. Broadly speaking, the format
of cause-of-death information on _ the
older certificates is the inverse of that on
the modern ones. The primary (underlying) cause is listed first instead of last. To
simplify processing the early data, nosologists coded the primary and contributory
causes on the certificates as if they were
all entered on one line. By this means the
computer program used to select the underlying cause was forced (in general) to
select the first cause listed on the older
certificates. That would ordinarily be the
certifier’s selected underlying cause.

The changes in the death certificate
format during the study period are not a
major problem. The net effect of the certificate changes appears to be insignificant. There is no shift, for example, in the
ratio of total mentions of tuberculosis (or
other causes) to underlying cause mentions around 1949, or any other evidence
of discontinuity that might be attributable
to change in certificate design.

Persons of Mexican origin are identified as white persons of Spanish surname,

 

Social Biology

a procedure which past research has
shown to yield consistent and reproducible results that in some respects are
preferable to those obtained from data
on Mexican-origin decedents as identified ©
by survivors (Rosenwaike and Bradshaw,
1988). Furthermore, the Spanish surname
identifier 1s the only one available prior to
about 1980. The San Antonio mortality
data provide a unique source for investigating the natural history of causes of
death. To our knowledge, they are the
only source for detailed study of mortality of persons of Mexican origin over
such a long period of time.

METHODS

Most of the results presented in the paper are estimated from (a) multiple decrement life tables, which provide distributions of deaths by age and underlying
cause that would occur in a hypothetical
cohort of 100,000 newborns followed to
their deaths, and (b) cause-eliminated life
tables showing the distributions of deaths
as they would appear if tuberculosis were
eliminated. For both types of life tables,
conventional abridged life tables were
constructed using the Bexar County death
files and U.S. census populations and intercensal estimates.

For the multiple decrement life tables,
the ,d, terms of the abridged life tables
(life table deaths between ages x and x +
5) were distributed by cause.as a proportion of total deaths by age in each age im
terval (sD, j /,D,.), that is, where 5D,

s@,;, that were generated were then
summed to yield J, ,, the number of all of
those in the life table who would die of
tuberculosis beyond age x. The initial
terms /, ;, are the sums over all ages of

life table deaths due to tuberculosis.
From the J, ; j Semies, 15€0,j °F 60€15, terms
were computed, representing the life expectancy from birth to age 75 and from
age 15 to age 75, respectively, for persons
dying of the disease. The tables are restricted to ages under 75 because of the
relatively poor quality of age reporting
after that age. Also, selected tables for
Mexican immigrants were restricted to
sages 15 to 75 because of the small num“bers of persons under 15 who were born
Sin Mexico.

8 For the cause-eliminated life tables,
AsP,, and .q,; terms (5-year survival probabilities and death probabilities, respectively,
mbetween ages x and x + 5) were estimated
“by raising the life table ;p, terms to the
powers of 5D,.j/sP, (Greville’s formula).
‘she mortality probabjlities 5q,, found in
.cthis manner are probabilities of dying of
Seach cause after removing the effects of
Zcompeting risks due to all other causes.
‘These probabilities are used in preference
“to multiple decrement mortality probabiliSties because in the first decades of the
‘Sstudy period differences in life expectancy
between the Mexican-descent and Anglo
opulations were very large for several
causes of death. In such circumstances,
cause-eliminated probabilities provide a
Sbetter indication of the underlying mortalGity hazard than do the observed rates. Hazard and cause-eliminated mortality probabilities are linked through the approximate
relationship MU. , qi =In (1 fej ./5, where
MU,, is the mortality hazard for the cause
of interest and is related to the overall hazard MU, by MU, = &,MU,,. The overall
and single-cause hazards are typically
close to age-specific death rates which lend

them an intuitive interpretation.

RESULTS

1. Temporary Life Expectancy.—In
1940 (i.e., average 1938-42), temporary
life expectancy from birth to age 75
(759) Of the Mexican-origin population
in Bexar County was about 47 for both
males and females, or approximately the
same as life expectancy of the United
States population tn 1900 (Table 1). The
similarity of the male and female life expectancies is notable, and hints at the predominance of infectious diseases, such as

- tuberculosis, that tended to afflict both

sexes to about the same degree. Life expectancies of Anglos were much higher
(56.3 for males and 61.3 for females), but
nevertheless still lagged behind the
United States as a whole, being comparable to U.S. life expectancies of 1930. As
the data in Table 1 show, from 1940 to
1980 there was a steady trend toward
convergence of life expectancies of the
ethnic groups, so that by 1980, the differences had almost disappeared. It is also
noteworthy that during the secular tmprovement in Mexican-origin mortality,
females improved more rapidly, thus
leading to the familiar advantage of femates with respect to males.

The most rapid increases in life expectancy among either persons of Mexican origin or other white persons occurred during the 1940’s, but increases
among the former group were much
greater. Between 1940 and 1950, temporary life expectancy between 0 and 75 of
Mexican-origin women rose by 12.7
years, and of Mexican-origin men by
10.3 years. The comparable figures for

Anglo women and men were 5.7 years
and 7.0 years, respectively. There were
also very substantial increases (over 6.0
years) in life expectancy of MexicanOrigin men and women in the 1950’s, but
after that decade, improvement was much
slower. The 1950’s were also the last
decade of relatively rapid improvement in
Anglo life expectancy. Control of death
from tuberculosis was one of the major
reasons for the great increase in life expectancy between 1940 and 1950, especially for the Mexican-origin population,
but also for Anglos. The following -sections describe in some detail how age specific and cohort changes in tuberculosis resulted in these remarkable improvements.
2. Life Table Probabilities of Dying
from Tuberculosis —Among Bexar County
Mexican-Americans in the five-year period around 1940, the probability of dying
from tuberculosis between birth and age
75 was over 13 per cent (i.e., 13,571 of
100,000 total life table deaths) (Table 2).
The comparable life table figure for the
United States in 1900 was about 8 per
cent (Preston et al., 1972). In other words,
with respect to tuberculosis, the San An
tonio Mexican-origin population _presented the aspect of a mid-nineteenthcentury population. The probabilities of
tuberculosis death in the 1940 Anglo life
tables, on the other hand, were almost
identical to those in the United States life
tables for the same year (about 3 per
cent) (Preston et al., 1972).

The 1940 life table death rates corresponding to the probabilities of tuberculosis death between birth and age 75 were
about 290 per 100,000 for Mexican origin
men and women (Table 2). These rates
were five and seven times those of Anglo
males and females, respectively.

Five-year age-specific probabilities of
death for tuberculosis in 1940-60 (i.e.,
1938-42 to 1958-62), independent of
other causes, for the Bexar County Mexican-origin and Anglo populations reveal
the major ethnic differences to be qualitative as well as quantitative (Figures 1-4).
Note that Figures 1 and 3 for Mexicanorigin males and females are drawn on
different scales than those used in Figures
2 and 4 for Anglo males and females. The
maximum value in the former is 0.04000,
whereas in the latter it is only 0.00900.

SThe objective of the figures is to emphasize patterns of age-specific rates as well
Bs to convey values.
3 The age-specific distributions of probabilities in the 1940 Mexican descent
‘population (Figures 1 and 3) trace the
lassic pattern of tuberculosis as a disease
Avith heavy fatality in early adulthood,
when the cumulative damage produced
by the bacillus ceases to be offset by lung
growth. Among both males and females,
the probabilities rose sharply through the
teenage years and reached a peak risk of
over 3 per cent at age 20-24. Over the 20
years of age between 15 and 35 the unadjusted (conditional) probability reached 9
per cent and would have been 10 per cent
in the absence of other risks. In the Anglo

population, however, tuberculosis had by
1940 already largely become a disease of
old age, the only individuals still at high
risk being persons who may have contracted the disease before or near the turn
of the century when it was far more prevalent (Figures 2 and 4). Over the same
age interval 15-34, the unadjusted and
adjusted 20-year probabilities were not
above 1 per cent in the male and female
Anglo populations. In both Mexicanorigin and Anglo populations persons over
35 were survivors from periods of somewhat greater risk.

By 1945, the cumulative probability of
dying of tuberculosis between ages 15
and 35 had declined from 9 per cent to 5
per cent among Mexican-descent males

and from 10 per cent to 7 per cent among
Mexican-descent females, respectively (Figures 1 and 3). The peak ages of risk remained 20-24, but a shift toward becoming a disease of old age is clearly evident
by comparison with the 1938-42 distribution. For the Anglo population, the probability was under 0.5 per cent.

Mortality probabilities for ages 15 to 35
fell to 2 per cent for Mexican-descent
males and females in the 1950 (1948-52)
period, and for the first time fell below the
mortality probabilities for ages 55 and
above, the latter remaining near their previous levels.

The rapidity of the change in tuberculosis mortality is brought out particularly
sharply in the changing mortality prospects
of birth cohorts of Mexican descent reach
ing age 15 in 1938-42 (Figure 5) and in.

1943-47 (Figure 6). For the earlier cohort,
the figure displays the 1938-42 mortality
probabilities for the combined sexes, together with the actual probabilities the cohort experienced as members aged from
1940-80 (i.e., from age 15-19 to 50-54).
For both males and females, the mortality
probability had lessened by age 20 in 1945
(the first cohort for it to do so) and fell to
near zero by age 30. In the cohort reaching
age 15 in 1945, the mortality probability
was only half as great to age 20, in 1950,
and had fallen to near zero by age 25, in
1955. As in the earlier cohort, the cohort
probabilities fell immediately and sharply
below the period rates of 1943-47.

The completion of the transition in tuberculosis mortality in the Mexican-origin
population can be seen in the data for the
subsequent 5-year period around 1960. By
that quinquennium nearly all tuberculosis
deaths were probably due to the lingering

predated streptomycin, or from untreated

cases. A comparison of Figures 14 will
indicate the progressive aging of the tuberculosis death cohorts that was then occurring, and the near total absence of tuberculosis deaths prior to midlife in the 1960
data.

3. Life Expectancy of Persons Dying
from Tuberculosis and Added Years of
Life.-—Over the transition in tuberculosis
mortality in the Mexican-origin popula- ©
tion from 1938-42 to 1958-62, the life
table proportion of deaths due to tuberculosis fell approximately linearly. The
change represents both a large absolute
and a large relative decline in the contribution of tuberculosis to the ethnic mortality difference. For the Mexican-descent
population, the life expectancy for those
dying of tuberculosis rose by more than
20 years, from below age 35 to age 55
during the same period (Figure 7). The
change among Anglos was from about 50
years of age to about 60 years, or from a
15-year advantage to a 5-year advantage
relative to individuals of Mexican descent.

As would be expected from the above
results, the potential years of life that
would be added by elimination of tuberculosis as a cause of death diminished
sharply between 1940 and 1960, and by
1980, the effect of elimination would be
negligible (Table 3). In 1940, however,
because of the concentration of high mortality in young adulthood, the added years
of life would have been substantial—S.8
and 6.2 years, respectively, to temporary
life expectancy of Mexican-origin males
and females. In both the Mexican-origin
and the Anglo population, added years
of life were more than halved between
1940 and 1950. Subsequent to these
changes, by 1958-62 Bexar County Anglo
mortality from tuberculosis was on the order of 1 per cent of life table deaths, and by

County, 1938-42 to 1983-85.

1968-72, on the order of 0.25 per cent. Because of the burden of tuberculosis in aging cohorts, the rate continued higher in the
Mexican-descent population, remaining
near 0.5 per cent as of 1978-82. Because
the deaths came to be almost wholly concentrated at the oldest ages, they ceased to
contribute measurably to life expectancy
differences between the Anglo and Mexican-descent populations about 1970.

Of the total difference in temporary
life expectancy between Anglo and
Mexican-American males and females in
1940 (9.5 years and 14.3 years, respectively), a substantial amount can be attributed to differences in tuberculosis
mortality rates (Table 4). In 1940, 4.0
years, or 42 per cent, of the difference between the male populations was due to
tuberculosis mortality among MexicanAmericans. Mexican-American females

in 1940 had an even greater disadvantage
due to tuberculosis (4.7 years of life), but
the disease accounted for a smaller percentage of the overall difference in life expectancy (33 per cent). Over the 20 years
from 1940 to 1960, the disadvantage in
Mexican-origin years of life expectancy attributable to tuberculosis declined dramatically in both the male and female populations by over 94 per cent, and by 1980,
only a few hundredths of a year in life expectancy could still be attributed to that
cause.

4. Tuberculosis as an Underlying and
Contributing Cause of Death.—To this
point we have discussed tuberculosis as an
underlying cause of death. However, as indicated earlier, and as shown graphically
in Figure 8, a steadily decreasing percentage of persons in the life table cohort who
died with tuberculosis had that disease

both populations were similar, and therefore, are not displayed in Figure 8.

The shift from tuberculosis as an underlying cause of death to an associated
cause is due both to a reversal of ordering
for causes that were frequently mentioned
along with tuberculosis in the earlier
years of the study period (e.g., pneumonia
and influenza and other respiratory diseases), and to tuberculosis being mentioned in association with diseases of

aging (e.g., cancer and cardiovascular diseases) to which it was not formerly
linked. In both cases the ordering reflects
its waning significance as a cause of death
once chemotherapies were available to arrest it. These changes occurred in association with the increasing life expectancy of
persons who died from (or with) tuberculosis.

DISCUSSION

This paper describes the natural history
of tuberculosis mortality in one large urban
OMexican-origin population. The decline in
Odeath rates from this cause from the 1930’s
>.to the 1980’s, and especially from 1940 to
—1950 in San Antonio was indeed remarkable. Successive birth cohorts of Mexican<sAmericans, separated by as little as five
years of age, experienced distinctly lower
risks of death from tuberculosis as they en“stered young adulthood. As our data show,
zthere was a rapid convergence in ageZspecific patterns of tuberculosis death rates
Zin Mexican-Americans toward those of An~glo Americans, so that by 1960 tuberculosis was primarily a cause of death in old
‘gage rather than young adulthood. At the
gsame time it receded in importance as an
underlying cause and increasingly became
Ea condition associated with death in some
A other role.

As noted earlier, there has been extensive speculation about causes for the longterm decline in tuberculosis mortality in the
United States and Europe. Those declines,
however, while continuous, occurred over
several decades, not in the course of only
two, as in San Antonio. What accounted
for the exceptionally rapid improvement
in the city’s Mexican-origin population?

considered and will be the subject of future
research.

There is no question that housing conditions in San Antonio, at least for the
Mexican-origin population through the
early 1940’s, was as crowded and miserable as any in the United States (cf., Blackwelder, 1984; Garcia, 1991). A preliminary
mapping of the residential addresses of tuberculosis decedents in 1940 shows most
of them to have lived in neighborhoods
with minimal or no indoor running water
and sanitation, and with other indicators of
substandard living conditions. These conditions probably contributed to development
and spread of tuberculosis. Major housing
renewal, slum clearance, and code enforcement during the 1940’s and 1950’s very
likely contributed to a reduction in tuberculosis morbidity.

Certain intriguing questions have
arisen with respect to the possible reasons
for the extremely rapid improvement. in
tuberculosis mortality. These questions
need to be addressed not only for San Antonio, but also for other communities, and
they are broader than tuberculosis. The
membership of successive birth cohorts
comprising the population of any urban
community is not closed to migration as
the cohorts age. That is, as persons move
into and out of a community, membership
of cohorts and the characteristics of members may be different at the end of a
decade than would have been the case had
the community been closed to mobility
and subject only to mortality. For example,
in San Antonio, the Mexican-origin cohort
aged 20-29 in 1940, by the time surviving
members aged to 30-39 in 1950, had a different membership composition with respect to nativity (i.e., the proportion born
in Mexico), earlier living conditions, and

exposure to infection. Only a few of such
cohort-specific factors can be examined
with our data, including net migration by
nativity status. Some other facts can be investigated by linking birth and death certificates to census blocks and tracts of residence for purposes of examining changing
social, economic, and environmental characteristics of neighborhoods. Birth addresses especially are of interest in regard
to tuberculosis because they reflect the distribution of cohorts of young adults at
greatest risk of death at the beginning of
our study. Mapping of a sample of addresses of birth mothers in 1940 and 1950
shows an incipient movement of Mexicanorigin persons to areas of the city where
housing was better than in the old West
Side slums. The redistribution, of course,
may be a consequence of residential selection by new migrants to the community.
In either case, period mortality rates reflect
frequency of events at a specific moment,
regardless of changes in person-specific
characteristics within cohorts or broader
community-level changes that may affect
al] persons over time. The impact of changing environment, both through improvements of conditions within neighborhoods
and through residential mobility, on birth
cohorts at risk of disease needs to be examined in more detail.

Social Biology

For all of these issues, the 1940-54 period constitutes a critical window of opportunity for investigation. In the early
1950’s the importance of environmental
factors was diminished abruptly, as antibiotics erased the heterogeneity that had
characterized exposure and illness in the
Mexican-origin and Anglo populations up
to that time. The postwar changes in living conditions might have had the same
effect over a longer period and may
greatly limit the risk of a resurgence of tuberculosis in our own time, even with the
antibiotic resistance that the bacillus is
now displaying. The importance of living
conditions is not always appreciated, but
was the major contributor to the pre-1950
decline in tuberculosis in the Anglo population, and in the convergence that was already evident in the Mexican-origin popuJation when antibiotics came into use.
