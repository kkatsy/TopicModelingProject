ABSTRACT This paper examines the effects of kin access on prenatal health practices, birth
outcome, and postnatal health practice for infants born to black and white mothers ages 21 to 28
in the U.S. during 1984—86. The data used for this research were compiled from three sources:
(1) The Nationa! Longitudinal Survey of Youth; (2) The Children of the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth; (3) special kin access data files, which were created specifically for this study.
Logistic regression procedures are used to assess the effects of kin proximity, maternal
grandmother proximity, and presence of the child’s father on health practices(N = 1,030) and
birth outcome (N = 1,385), controlling for the mother’s educational attainment, work
experience, poverty, presence of the child’s father, and birth order of the child. We find no
evidence supporting the notion that kin access positively affects the prenatal and postnatal
health practices of young mothers. The results suggest that young mothers who reside with their
mothers or other adult kin, and those who are in close proximity to them, are no more likely to
seek prenatal care during the first trimester, or to avoid smoking or drinking during pregnancy.
Mothers who live with a sexual partner or husband are, however, somewhat more likely to seek
prenatal care and to avoid alcohol use during pregnancy. Closer kin access is associated with a
lower probability of breastfeeding. These results suggest that it will not be adequate to rely on
kin networks or kin assistance to improve the prospect of healthy birth outcomes.

of kin support and other family factors (Shadish and Reis, 1984; Institute of
on healthy birth outcomes have concen- Medicine, 1985; Singh et al., 1985). In

consumption during the pregnancy, the al., 1974). High-risk mothers include
timing of prenatal health care, those who are poorly educated, unmarbirthweight, and breastfeeding. In this ried, young at the time of conception,

care at all (Kessel et al., 1984). Also,
Gortmaker (1979) found that prenatal
care is associated with higher birthweight which in turn is related to a lower
risk of infant death.

In light of these research findings, the
Surgeon General has called for an increase to 90 per cent by 1990 in the proportion of women receiving care within
their first trimester (Golden et al.,

wn 1984). Also, the American College of
S Obstetricians and Gynecologists has
5 ‘g recommended a total of 15 prenatal vis€ its over the course of a pregnancy
S ° (American College of Obstetricians and
S Gynecologists, 1982).
2 Although the proportion of minority
ps women and adolescents seeking prena“ tal care increased during the past dec% ade, it remains substantially lower than
g 5 the national average. In 1986, only 76
5 = per cent of all women experiencing live

- their first trimester (National Center for
>Health Statistics, 1988). This figure was
‘2 even lower for blacks, of whom about 60

5 _ In addition, using the guidelines esplablished by the American College of
3 = Obstetricians and Gynecologists, we
3 find that in 1986 only 14 per cent of all
< women experiencing live births made 15
= or more visits for prenatal care. For
A blacks, only 11 per cent made the recommended number of visits. Adolescents are also less likely to receive adequate care. For those under 19 years of
age, only 10 per cent of white girls and 8
per cent of black girls made the recommended number of prenatal visits (National Center for Health Statistics,
1988). Other ‘research has shown that
young women, those of low income
backgrounds, minorities, those who are
unmarried, and those having completed
less than a high-school education are at

 

Family Networks 85

significantly increased risk of obtaining
inadequate prenatal care (Singh et al.,
1985). Thus, those groups of women at
the greatest risk of experiencing complicated pregnancies are exactly the ones
least likely to receive adequate prenatal
care.

Two causes have been hypothesized
as contributing to the unequal distribution of prenatal care. Gortmaker (1979)
suggests that inadequacies of the medical and welfare systems may be in large
part responsible. Other evidence suggests that women of these particular
backgrounds are less well integrated
into society, as indicated by their sparse
interactions with organizations, institutions, and agencies. Thus, they may possess fewer skills and less knowledge in
seeking prenatal care services. Regardless of the explanation one chooses, the
end result is that these women are not
receiving adequate prenatal care.

There is research, however, which
suggests that kin and friends may be able
to provide advice and support to these
women. It is thought that these support
networks may at least partially compensate for the lack of effective social integration and the inadequacies of the welfare and medical systems. In general,
kinship and friendship networks have
been found to affect an individual’s
definition of, and response to, illnesses
or life crises (Zola, 1964; Suchman,
1965). More specifically, it has been
shown that people involved in strong socia] networks are more likely to engage
in preventive health behavior and to receive more direct psychological support
(see summaries and critiques of this literature in Levin and Idler, 1981; Alcalay, 1983; and Berkman, 1984).

Kin support may be especially critical
for prenatal and postnatal care among
young, unmarried, and black women

having a child. Although no research
has specifically studied the relationship
between kin support and prenatal health
practices such as smoking and alcohol
consumption, some studies have examined the effects of kin support on the use
of professional prenatal care and on the
likelihood of breastfeeding. It has been
shown that mothers neglect such care
not only when they are poor and less
well educated, but also when they are
socially isolated from spouses, parents,
and friends (Morris, 1966a,b). Causes
range from the simple inability to find
time to go to aclinic when forced to tend
house by oneself (Smiley et al., 1972), to
the greater emotional support pregnant
mothers receive when others are at hand
(Berkman, 1984).

In another study, McKinlay (1973)
has shown that given the existence of kin
networks, the degree of social integration determines, in part, the form of the
kin network and whether or not a
woman seeks prenatal care. The study
shows that those women who are relatively independent and well-integrated
into society tend to be utilizers of prenatal care; they also have networks which
are more heavily constructed around
friendships, but need not rely on these
for health care advice. Women who are
not well integrated into society tend not
to be utilizers of prenatal care; they are
more likely to structure their networks
around relatives. These women tend to
rely on relatives as lay health care consultants.

Such advice from friends and relatives may not, however, adequately replace professional care. Although McKinlay (1973) found that those women
who were less effectively integrated into
society via institutions were more likely
to rely on kin for advice, he also found
that this advice did not necessarily lead

Social Biology

to better prenatal and postnatal health
practices. He reasoned that this was because consulting with friends and kin
may substitute for professional care
rather than complement it.

Evidence regarding how kin support
affects breastfeeding is mixed (see review of this literature in McCann et al.,
1981). Several studies have shown that
when adult relatives are present, mothers are more likely to breastfeed. Many
explanations have been offered in support of this finding. Some studies have
shown that women kin who have
breastfed provide advice and guidance
to the new mother, thereby alleviating
possible anxieties associated with
breastfeeding. Some studies suggest
that adult members of the household, by
taking responsibility for domestic
chores, free the new mother to breastfeed.

Other studies have shown that to the
contrary, kin presence in the household
can reduce the likelihood of breastfeeding (McCann et al., 1981). Here it is argued that the presence of other kin provides the new mother with an additional
incentive to forego breastfeeding because there are others available to feed
the baby.

Although no studies have been done
regarding the effects of kin support on
the smoking and drinking behaviors of
pregnant women, Berkman (1984) suggests that individuals in a network frequently feel constrained to behave like
other network members. In the case of
pregnant women, this could be interpreted to mean that if someone in the
woman’s network smokes cigarettes or
drinks alcohol, the woman may engage
in like behavior simply to maintain her
group identity. Alternatively, kin who
do not smoke or drink alcohol may be
more successful at imposing those be

haviors on young women during pregnancy, where such behaviors are viewed
as especially hazardous.

Other studies point to the overall importance of birthweight in assessing the
health ofa newborn. Cigarette smoking,
alcohol consumption, use of prenatal]
care, and nutrition have all been linked
to infant birthweight. Although no studies have specifically studied this relationship, in as much as kin networks in
vfluence these habits, they will have an
Smpact on infant birthweight.

© Thus, while some studies have found
of in support to be positively related to
‘prenatal health practices and breastFeeding, others have found the opposite
Go be true. Many of the studies of the efSfects of kin support networks on prena“tal care and breastfeeding have been
based on small and possibly unrepreSentative population samples. Often
‘these studies are limited to investigating
weffects as they pertain to one ethnic
“group or to single mothers. Many times,
psomparisons are made to an “‘idealized”’
‘ntact white family, rather than to famiies as they actually exist.

5 Most of these studies did attempt to

ake into account the effects of some of
$he background and control factors, ei“ther by matching comparison groups on
“key socioeconomic and race attributes
or by statistical manipulations, But none
Fof these studies adequately specified all
of the socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors which are considered to
be important, such as race, educational
attainment, income, household structure, birth order, labor force participation and age of mother at birth, even
though these factors are known to be related to prenatal care and preventive
health behaviors.
In addition, there is no one study
which has been concerned with the rela
 

Family Networks 87

tionship between kin and the wide spectrum of prenatal and postnatal behaviors that relate to healthy birth
outcomes. Although professional prenatal care and breastfeeding are indeed
important, they are not the only practices which significantly affect birth outcomes and the subsequent health of the
child. Other factors of importance include alcohol use and smoking behavior. In addition, although the child’s
birthweight is not a prenatal or postnatal
health practice per se, it is an important
indicator of a healthy birth outcome,
and as such, we include it in this study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STUDY DESIGN

The study design we employ to examine the effects of kin support on prenatal
health care, and on prenatal and postnatal health practices, is constructed to
eliminate many of the problematic aspects of previous research. First, we use
longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample, with oversamples of
young women in critical population subgroups. These sampling characteristics
provide for generalizable results and
permit the examination of the subgroups in which we are most interested.
In addition, the longitudinal aspects of
the data make it possible to specify the
correct timing of the independent variables. Second, the survey data provide
much more extensive information on
education, income, and prenatal and
postnatal health practices than were
available in previous studies. The availability of such data enables us to specify
models which adequately control for the
relevant background variables and
which examine the various aspects of
prenatal and postnatal health practices
and child’s birthweight that relate to a

88 Casper and Hogan

healthy birth outcome. Finally, the longitudinal design of the study lets us examine prenatal behaviors surrounding
individual pregnancies as they occur, as
opposed to examining them retrospectively.

HYPOTHESES

Findings in the majority of studies we
reviewed suggest a positive relationship
between kin support, prenatal care, and
positive health practices in general. We
will also incorporate prenatal and postnatal health practices and will postulate
that kin support will have a positive impact on these factors.

Furthermore, we expect that the
probability of a child’s mother practicing healthy behavior while pregnant will
be affected by many socioeconomic and
sociodemographic factors. It is likely
that such behavior will be affected by
the child’s race, the economic status of
the household in which the child resides,
maternal educational attainment, maternal labor force participation, the
birth order of the child, the presence of a
spouse or partner of the mother in the
household, and the age of the mother at
birth of the child. Specifically, we expect
to find the probability of risky prenatal
behavior to be highest among mothers
who are less highly educated, younger,
and who do not have a partner or spouse
in their household. Similarly, we expect
that children who are black, reside in
low income households, and are first
born will have a mother who was more
likely to exhibit risky behavior while
pregnant.

Finally, we expect the mother’s labor
force participation to have an impact on
prenatal health practices. It may be that
working mothers, because they have
more contact with individuals who can
influence their behavior, or because

Social Biology

they are more likely to have health insurance and thus to get prenatal care,
are more likely to have healthy prenatal
and postnatal practices. However, it
could also be that these women associate with others who encourage risky behavior. We therefore wish to control for
this variable without providing any specific hypothesis. When examining
breastfeeding, however, we expect maternal labor force participation to have a
negative effect because working women
are less likely to have the flexible time
that breastfeeding requires.

DATA

For our research we compiled a data
set from three sources: (1) the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth (hereafter, NLSY); (2) the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
(hereafter, the Children of NLSY); and
(3) special kin-access data files, which
were created specifically for this study.
Data from the three sources are
matched across mothers to provide social and demographic background information and characteristics of the women
during their pregnancies, on the birth
outcome and postnatal care, and on access of the mother to kin.

The NLSY data is based on a nationally representative sample of young
women aged 14—21 in 1979 in the United
States. The study design provided for
oversamples of blacks and economically
disadvantaged women who typically
have higher rates of premarital parenthood and mother-headed families.
These women were interviewed annually from 1979 to the present. Approximately 5,500 women, or 92 per cent of
the original sample, ranging in age from
21 to 28 remained in the sample as of
1986. Of these women, 2,922 had given
birth to a total of 5,876 children.

 
 

Vol. 37, No. 1-2

In 1986, each child of the NLSY
women respondents was studied, with
information about each child provided
by its mother and obtained from observation of the child by trained interviewers. The child data were merged with selected information collected about the
mothers in the 1979-86 NLSY. The resulting Children-of-NLSY data file includes about 3,000 variables with information on each child’s mother’s marital

wn and fertility history, family background,

The “‘kin-access” file was created
from previously unused machine readable data, gathered in 1983, 1984, and
1985, that permit the indirect reconstruction of residential proximity data.
Fach year the NLSY interviewers asked
a series of questions (found in the survey
locator sheets) designed to enable
NORC (the survey organization collect
nive

Family Networks 89

ing the NLSY data) to find respondents
who moved between interview rounds.
The interviewer first ascertained the
correctness of the respondent’s name,
address, and telephone number, the
permanent address of respondents living in dormitories, hospitals, or other
temporary quarters, and the name and
address of a spouse who lived apart. The
interviewer then asked for the name, address, and phone number of other people likely to know where the respondent
could be reached. These included both
parents, two other relatives with whom
they were in close touch, and two friends
with whom they were in touch frequently. This information is provided in
eight data fields.

Since the data are alphanumeric and
involve confidential respondent information, they cannot be directly used for
research purposes. Working with the
NORC survey staff and computer programmers, we developed procedures
for coding these data into usable information on kin and friend access. For
each of the eight data fields, we obtained
four variables: (a) the relationship of the
person comparing the respondent and
the person named in regard to (bd) city
and state, (c) zip code, and (d) telephone number. We used this information in conjunction with the data on coresidential living arrangements from the
household-roster component of the survey to develop measures of access to
kin.

The resultant data set contains information on social and demographic situations of women during their pregnancies
and at the birth of their children, the access of the mother to key kin during
these critical periods, and on prenatal
and postnatal health for the 5,876 births
that had occurred to the 2,922 mothers
interviewed in the 1986 NLSY.

StuDy POPULATION

Our research focuses on black and on
nonblack non-Hispanic children (hereafter referred to as “whites”) who were
born in 1984, 1985, and 1986. We select
only those children born subsequent to
the 1984 interview because kin access information for the prenatal period was
available for these births. Because one
of our dependent variables (breastfeeding) requires the mother and child to be
in the same household after the birth of
the child, we elected to focus only on the
births in which the children resided with
their mothers at least during the year after they were born. The subsamples on
which our analyses are based include
1,030 children born to 971 mothers for
those models referring to prenatal
health practices and 1,385 children born
to 1,226 mothers for the model examining breastfeeding. Because it was necessary to insure the temporal appropriateness of the kin proximity variables,
these samples resulted in the inclusion
of different cases. In addition, it should
be noted that this sample of births includes some siblings, resulting in the
slightly larger number of births than
mothers. Therefore, caution should be
exercised in generalizing these results.

OUTCOME VARIABLES

We measure prenatal and postnatal
health practices in a variety of ways. The
literature suggests that professional prenatal care is important for healthy birth
outcomes (Shadish and Reis, 1984).
Other literature indicates that for prenatal care to be the most effective in promoting healthy birth outcomes, it
should be initiated within the first tnmester. (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 1982). Therefore, we use a dichotomous variable to

Casper and Hogan

Social Biology

 

indicate whether prenatal care was obtained in the first trimester.

Research also shows that risky behavior during pregnancy can have adverse effects on the development of the
fetus. The Surgeon General has warned
that smoking slows fetal growth, doubles the chance of having a lowbirthweight baby, and increases the risk
of stillbirth. Studies also indicate that
babies of mothers who drink large quantities of alcohol may suffer from low
birthweight, birth defects, mental retardation, and patterns of abnormalities
called fetal alcohol syndrome (Office of
the Assistant Secretary for Health and
the Surgeon General, 1979). Based on
the questions asked, the coding of the
data collected, and the distribution of
responses, dichotomous variables were
constructed for these two indicators.
Risky drinking behavior is defined as the
consumption of alcohol more than three
days a month; any amount of regular
cigarette smoking is defined as risky behavior.

Research suggests that low
birthweight is associated with, and may
be a causal factor for, neonatal mortality, postneonatal mortality, hospitalizations during infancy, and serious illnesses (Jackel et al., 1975; Institute of
Medicine, 1985). Babies who weigh less
than 5.5 pounds at birth are considered
to be of low birthweight. In this study, a
dichotomous variable is used to indicate
whether the child was a low-birthweight
infant.

The last health practice we will consider is breastfeeding. Studies have
shown that breastfeeding is the best
form of nutrition for an infant (McCann
et al., 1981). In addition, breast milk
provides immunological protection
against diarrhea and respiratory disease. Here, we use a dichotomous varia
 

  
 

Vol. 37, No. 1-2

i

ble to indicate whether a child was ever
breastfed.

MEASURES OF KIN ACCESS

Ethnographic research has shown
that kin access is an essential component
of kin support networks. It has been
shown that nearby kin may provide

Family Networks 91

mothers insofar as distance is a key determinant of certain types of support
which require personal interaction
(Klatzky, 1972; Wilkening et al., 1972;
Clark and Gordon, 1979; Lee, 1980;
Litwak, 1981). We therefore use two
measures of kin proximity and a third
measure which indicates father proximity (see Table 1 for the coding of varia
daily support and advice to pregnant bles and their means).

*Standard deviations for continuous variables in parentheses.

The first measure is a set of dummy
variables which indicates the geographic
location of the child’s maternal grandmother. For this measure, we have constructed four dummy variables for five
categories: grandmother in the household, grandmother in the neighborhood, grandmother within 50 miles,
missing data on grandmother proximity,
and grandmother farther than 50 miles
away (omitted reference category). The
second measure of kin access indicates
the closest geographic access to any of
the child’s adult kin including the maternal grandmother. The construction of

this variable parallels that of the grandmother proximity measure, but takes
into account other adult kin as well. Father’s proximity is measured by a dichotomous variable indicating the presence
or absence of the spouse or partner of
the mother (whom we infer to be the father of the infant) in the same household.

CONTROL VARIABLES

There are several factors which have
been shown to relate to the likelihood of
practicing healthy prenatal and postnatal behavior. They include race of the

 
 

Vol. 37, No. 1-2

child, mother’s educational attainment,
birth order of the child, mother’s labor
force participation, the mother’s age at
the birth of the child, and household income. Most of these variables have been
coded as dichotomous with the exception of the mother’s age at the birth of
the child, which is a continuous variable
measuring the mother’s age in years.
Mother’s educational attainment is
measured by whether or not she graduwated from high school. Her labor force
participation is measured, for the prenaStal outcomes, by whether or not she
eworked when she was pregnant, or, for
Sthe postnatal outcome (breastfeeding),

= Special precaution was taken to enSsure that the timing of the independent
Svariables corresponded to that of the de= pendent variables. We measured spouse
Aor partner’s presence in the household,
kin and grandmother proximity, and
poverty status during the mother’s pregnancy, for the prenatal health variables.
For breastfeeding, the only postnatal
health indicator, these variables were
measured after the birth of the child,
corresponding to the time the child
would be most likely to be breastfeeding.

both during their pregnancies and directly after the birth of their children. In
about 40 per cent of the cases, the child’s
grandmother resided in either the same
household as the child’s mother or
within the same neighborhood, In over
half of the cases, a child’s mother was either living with an adult relative (other
than her spouse), or was residing in the
same neighborhood.

In general, the results corresponding
to access to the father are not so favorable. Table 1 shows that only a little over
one-half of the mothers had a spouse or
partner living with them while they were
pregnant. However, over two-thirds of
these women were living with a partner
or spouse after the birth of the child.

Table 1 shows that a majority of the
women in the sample were practicing
healthy prenatal behaviors. Eighty per
cent of the women sought early prenatal
care. Two-thirds did not smoke and 91
per cent did not drink while they were
pregnant. Ninety-one per cent of these
women gave birth to a child who
weighed over 5.5 pounds. However,
only 45 per cent of the infants were
breastfed.

METHODS

This research investigates the effects
of kin access on the prenatal and postnatal health practices described in the previous section while simultaneously controlling for the various socioeconomic
and sociodemographic factors known to
be related to these behaviors. Due to the
dichotomous nature of the dependent
variables, we employ logistic regression
as our method of analysis. For each dependent variable, we will have two
models, one for each of the measures of
kin access. The first model incorporates
the measure of kin access which indi

relative to the child. Anomalously, having the closest kin live outside of the
mother’s neighborhood, but within fifty
miles, is associated with a higher likelihood that the mother obtained prenatal
care, relative to those mothers whose
closest kin live farther away (p < 0.05).
While statistically significant, this may
be a chance outcome; closer kin access is
not associated with improved use of prenatal care.

The presence of a spouse or partner
of the mother in the household is significantly related to the probability that a
woman will seek prenatal care. Specifically, if there is a father in the household, a child’s mother is much more
 

Vol. 37, No. 1-2

likely to have received prenatal care
within the first trimester (p < 0.01).
There is but one other factor which is
related to the use of prenatal care. As
was hypothesized, mother’s education is
positively related to the probability of
obtaining adequate prenatal care (see
Models 1 and 2 of Table 2); that is,
women who are more adequately educated are more likely to receive prenatal
care within the first trimester of their

~pregnancy.

‘Swhether or not the father is present in

the probability that a woman will not use

Spouse or partner of the mother in the
household of the child is positively re‘gated to the probability that the mother
‘did not consume alcohol while pregfnant. The models in Panel A also indiate that the mothers of those children
who are not in poverty are also significantly less likely to drink during their
pregnancies (p < 0.05).

The geographic proximity of the
grandmother to the child has no significant influence on the probability that the
mother did not smoke while she was
pregnant. Kin access and father proximity are similarly irrelevant to the mother’s smoking practices during pregnancy
(see Panel B).

Family Networks 95

Controlling for the other variables in
the model, mothers of black children
and better-educated mothers are more
likely to abstain from smoking while
pregnant. Women in poverty were
much more likely to smoke during their
pregnancies than were mothers with adequate incomes.

CHILD’s BIRTHWEIGHT

Factors affecting birthweight outcomes have not been well specified as
evidenced by the poor fit of the models
(p =0.221) (see Table 4). Whether an
infant is born at an adequate birthweight
is not affected by grandmother, kin, or
father proximity. Children born to
mothers who are not in poverty are
much more likely to have normal
birthweights than children of poor
mothers. No other social or demographic variables in these models affect
the likelihood of an adequate birthweight.

BREASTFEEDING

Breastfeeding is the only outcome
variable for which grandmother and kin
proximity have any consistent effect.
Contrary to our hypotheses, however,
the closer the grandmother or other relative is to the child, the less likely the
mother is to breastfeed (Table 5). The
father’s presence in the household does
not appear to change the probability
that a mother will breastfeed.

As predicted, net of all other effects,
older mothers are more likely to breastfeed. Mothers who have graduated from
high school are more likely to breastfeed, but breastfeeding does not differ
between mothers in poverty and mothers with adequate incomes. White children are more likely to be breastfed than
are black children, net of all other effects. Finally, those children who are the

practices and the contrary finding regarding breastfeeding. We reasoned
that these results might possibly be
masking some interactions among the

kin access might be most important for

age years), replacing the kin and grandmother access variables with measures
indicating the presence or absence of
adult males and females in the household (discounting, of course, the child’s
mother and her partner or spouse). We
found no effect of kin and grandmother
coresidence on the likelihood that a
teenage mother will practice healthy
prenatal and postnatal behaviors.

CONCLUSIONS

None of our investigations produced
any evidence to lend credence to the notion that kin and grandmother networks, as indicated by geographic prox
 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 37, No. 1-2

imity, positively affect the prenatal and
postnatal health practices of young
mothers. In support of McKinlay’s findings, our results suggest that pregnant
women who reside with their mothers or
other adult kin, and those who are in
close proximity to their kin, are no more
likely than other women to seek medical
care during the first trimester of pregnancy, nor are they less likely to smoke
or drink while pregnant. Contrary to our
hypothesis, better kin access is not associated with an adequate child
birthweight. In fact, the only significant
relationship between kin access and
health practice was a negative one—
women with closer kin access are less
likely to breastfeed their infants.
Although these results were unexpected, we may speculate on some plausible explanations. In general, one may
question the adequacy of the proximity
of geographic residence as an indicator
of kin support. The presence of kin in
the same house or neighborhood as the
pregnant woman or new mother does
not necessarily mean that there is interaction between the woman and her kin.
Also, although there may be some form
of interaction, there may be no support
offered in the areas of prenatal and postnatal behaviors we have examined.
Likewise, one may suggest alternative explanations for the findings regarding birthweight and smoking and drinking behaviors. As was mentioned, the
model predicting birthweight was
poorly specified. To maintain a parallel
between this model and the others in the
analysis, several of the factors known to
be related to birthweight such as smoking, alcohol consumption, prenatal
care, and nutritional intake were excluded from the model. Although there
was no information available pertaining
to the nutritional intake of the mother,

Family Networks

 

99

we specified a model which included the
effects of smoking, alcohol consumption, and prenatal care on the birthweight of the child. Inclusion of these
variables did not significantly alter the
findings, however, and the resultant
model actually yielded a worse fit to the
data. There still remains a remote possibility that testing for the results of nutritional intake might alter these findings
somewhat.

The results pertaining to smoking
and drinking behaviors can also be reinterpreted. Although we found no evidence of kin influence on these behaviors among pregnant women, it could be
that these influences are dependent on
the kin’s own smoking and drinking
habits as was suggested by Berkman
(1984). To ascertain this relationship,
one would need information pertaining
to the smoking and drinking behaviors
of the kin in question. We have no such
data and cannot, therefore, draw any
specific conclusions.

There may be various reasons for the
contrary findings regarding breastfeeding. It might be that a grandmother’s
presence in the household is not positively associated with breastfeeding because she did not breastfeed and therefore, is unsupportive of her daughter
doing so. This interpretation is similar to
that offered by McCann et al. (1981).
However, given that the same pattern is
present when examining proximity of
kin and persists even when stratifying by
employment status, a more likely explanation is that the social taboo associated
with breastfeeding inhibits new mothers
from doing so. A new mother may simply be too shy to breastfeed her infant in
the presence of other family members.

Our results do, however, lend some
credence to the idea that the presence of
the father can be beneficial for the pre
 
 

100

natal and postnatal health practices of
mothers. Women with residential partners are more likely to obtain early prenatal care. They also are more likely to
abstain from drinking alcoholic beverages during pregnancy.

Such socioeconomic factors as maternal education and poverty are more salient for prenatal and postnatal health
than kin access as measured here.
Young mothers and those having their
first babies seemingly lack the knowledge and experience that lead to healthy
prenatal and postnatal behaviors. The
effects of these factors persist net of a
Q young mother’s access to her relatives.
& Kin access does not compensate for in© experience, ignorance, and poverty.
