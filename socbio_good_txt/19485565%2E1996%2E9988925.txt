Racial Fertility Differences: The Role
of Female Employment and Education
in Wanted and Unwanted Childbearing

ABSTRACT: This paper employs data from a merged sample of the National Surveys of Family
Growth to examine how female employment status conditions the relationship between education
and wanted and unwanted births among African American and white women. A rationale is
presented for why a minority group status hypothesis that posits lower fertility among more
highly educated African American women as compared to similar white women might find
support in the case of wanted births and among certain women, including earlier birth cohorts.
Our results provide some evidence for these ideas as well as evidence for a social characteristics
hypothesis that predicts convergence of childbearing with rising education. However, persistently
higher levels of unwanted births among African American women of all educational levels
suggest that the dynamics of racial fertility differences are more complex than either of the

hypotheses imply.

Studies of differential fertility between African Americans and whites
in the United States often focus on the
relationship between female education
and fertility. Investigations based upon
both survey and census data consistently find a stronger inverse relationship between education and childbearing among African American than
among white women (e.g., Bean and
Wood, 1974; Farley and Allen, 1987;
Johnson, 1979; Ritchey, 1975; St.
John, 1982; St. John and Grasmick,
1985). As we elaborate below, the research literature suggests this relationship might take any of three forms,
each of which corresponds to an alternative hypothesis about the social and
economic processes giving rise to racial
differentials in fertility by education.
The purpose of the present paper is to
examine whether the forms of the relationship depend on: (1) the kind of
fertility being examined (i.e., wanted

or unwanted fertility); (2) employment
status prior to the birth of their first
child; and (3) female education measured early in the life course as opposed to after childbearing is completed.

THE EDUCATION AND FERTILITY
RELATIONSHIP

Johnson (1979) has noted that a
more negative education/fertility relationship among African Americans
could in theory take any of three
forms. One would involve a “crossover” pattern in the data. This form
consists, ceteris paribus, both of lower
African American than white fertility
at high levels of education and of
higher African American than white
fertility at low levels of education. A
second form involves lower African
American than white fertility at high
levels of education, but insignificant

fertility differences between the two
groups at low levels of education, but
insignificant fertility differences between the two groups at low levels of
education. The former and the latter
patterns respectively provide support
for what Johnson (1979) has termed
the “strong” and the “‘weak” versions
of the minority group status hypothesis. While acknowledging the possibility that other forces also operate to
generate differential fertility, the hypothesis derives from the argument
that highly educated minority women,
in response to obstacles perceived to
the realization of mobility aspirations,
compensate by reducing childbearing
even below the level of highly educated
white women (Bean and Marcum,
1978; Goldscheider and Uhlenberg,
1969; Johnson, 1979).

The third form of the education/
fertility relationship involves higher
African American than white fertility
at low levels of education, but insignificant differences at high levels of education. In this case, which is the one
most frequently observed empirically,
it is generally argued that the pattern
results from greater similarity in the social and economic situations of African
Americans and whites at higher levels
of education. However, researchers
have differed concerning whether they
have emphasized social or economic
factors in this process. For example,
Johnson (1979) argues that the pattern
reflects more complete structural and
cultural assimilation among African
American women at higher as compared to lower levels of education. On
the other hand, Bean, Swicegood, and
Marcum (1985) suggest that it reflects
increasingly similar levels of earnings
and opportunity costs of childbearing

among highly educated African American and white women.

Because this form of the relationship involves fertility congruence only
at higher levels of education, Johnson
(1979) views it as providing support
for a “weak” version of the social characteristics hypothesis. In its ‘“strong”’
version, this hypothesis predicts that
fertility differences between African
American and white women can be
fully explained by differences in social,
demographic, or economic factors
known to influence fertility behavior
(Bean and Marcum, 1978; Farley and
Allen, 1987; Johnson, 1979). In Figure
1, we present graphic depictions of the
education/fertility relationships corresponding to the “‘strong” and ‘“‘weak”’
forms of both the social characteristics
and the minority group status hypotheses.

One of the difficulties that has
plagued attempts to test the minority
group Status and social characteristics
hypotheses has been that measures of
mobility aspirations and perceptions of
their likelihood of frustration have
never been available. Information has
not been available either in data sets
containing detailed information on
fertility or in data including sufficient
numbers of African Americans to permit reliable statistical estimates of fertility by educational level. Collecting
new data on mobility aspirations by
race for a nationally representative
sample would be inordinately expensive. Therefore, before collecting such
data, it is worthwhile first to examine
existing data in order to see which of
the various relationships between education and fertility predicted by the alternative hypotheses emerges from the
analyses.

It is also worth investigating the conditionality of these relationships. Uncovering the nature of any conditional
relationships, including those that
might suggest the circumstances under
which lower African American than
white fertility occurs among women of
higher levels of education could help
clarify the circumstances under which
the various mechanisms implied by
the alternative hypotheses might be
operating. With such considerations in
mind, this paper seeks to investigate
whether the pattern of African
American/white fertility differences by
education in the United States varies
depending upon (1) the wanted or unwanted status of births, (2) female employment status prior to first birth, and
(3) the time in the life course when education is measured.

RATIONALE

The nature and strength of the
education/fertility relationship may
vary depending on whether wanted or
unwanted fertility is being examined.
Researchers have consistently found
that African American women exhibit
higher levels of unwanted childbearing
than white women regardless of educational level (e.g., Eckard, 1980; Ryder and Westoff, 1972; Udry and Bauman, 1974; Williams and Pratt, 1990).
Studies comparing the cumulative fertility of African Americans and whites,
however, have often found little difference in the total numbers of births occurring to African American and white
women at higher levels of education
(e.g., Johnson, 1979). This finding
raises the possibility that more highly
educated African American women
might show lower levels of wanted

 

Fertility Differences

221

childbearing than more highly educated white women.

Comparisons of African Americans
and whites with respect to wanted and
unwanted births must be sensitive to
the possibility that measures of these
concepts may not indicate the same
thing for the two racial groups. Part of
the usefulness of the measures, however, is that variation in wanted and
unwanted childbearing undoubtedly
reflects the influence of both ‘“‘demand” and “supply” factors (Bulatao
and Lee, 1983). By demand factors we
mean variables that influence the number of births women want to have. By
supply factors we mean variables that
influence the number of births independent of the number desired. An example of a demand factor is desired
fertility, and an example of a supply
factor is fecundity (others are marriage, frequency of coitus, nutrition,
and breast feeding). It is difficult to ascertain that any factor is purely a demand or a supply factor, and thus it is
difficult to say that any measure of fertility unambiguously reflects the ‘“‘demand for births” and that any other
measure unambiguously reflects the
“supply for births.” _

Nonetheless, the number of wanted
births as measured in the data sets examined here (see below) seems likely
to correspond more closely to a measure of the “demand for births” than
does the measure of the number of
unwanted births. The number of unwanted births is more complex. While
it undoubtedly reflects the influence of
supply factors, it probably also reflects
the strength of motivation to contracept (the “demand for contraception’).
More specifically, unwanted births reflect situations where supply exceeds

222

demand. In any case, it is not unreasonable to think that variation in unwanted fertility reflects the influence of
supply of factors more so than does
variation in wanted births.

Measures of wanted births have
particular relevance for tests of hypotheses about racial differences in fertility which posit mechanisms involving
demand-related as opposed to supplyrelated determinants of fertility. This
would be the case, for example, with
the minority group status hypothesis,
which implies a demand-related mechanism of fertility reduction involving
actions consciously undertaken in order to compensate for the perception
of limited chances for mobility.

We also think female employment
may condition the education/fertility
relationship because of the different
employment experiences of African
American and white women. For example, levels of employment among
African American women have historically exceeded those for white women
(e.g., Bowen and Finegan, 1969; Herring and Wilson-Sadberry, 1993; Shapiro and Mott, 1979). Female employment has also constituted a more
important means of achieving mobility
among African Americans than among
whites, as is evidenced by the larger
fraction African American women
contribute to family income (e.g., Angel and Tienda, 1982; Sweet, 1973).
Moreover, results from the National
Longitudinal Surveys indicate that African American women manifest a
higher degree of work commitment
than white women, regardless of family
structure (e.g., Wallace, 1980). Whatever the reasons for the origin and
persistence of these differences in em

ployment patterns (see Herring and
Wilson-Sadberry, 1993, for a discussion of economic versus preference
reasons), they imply a greater normative commitment to work exists among
African American as compared to
white women. Interestingly, this finding parallels findings of less disagreement between African American husbands and wives compared with white
couples about definitions of appropriate sex role behaviors, including
whether or not the wife should work
(Scanzoni, 1979, p. 226-232).

Further insight into the importance
of African American female employment may be obtained by examining
the percentage of African American
men’s earnings constituted by African
American women’s earnings. For example, in 1981 African American
women with four years of college or
more earned 82.3 per cent as much as
similarly educated men, whereas comparable white women earned only 66.5
per cent as much as the white men
(Mellor and Stamas, 1982). In the
lowest educational category (8 years
or less), African American women
earned 71.1 per cent as much as African American men, whereas white
women earned 63.8 per cent as much
as white men. In short, the ratio of
female-to-male income is_ higher
among African Americans than among
whites, and it is highest at higher levels
of education.

The importance of these patterns
for our purposes can be seen in one of
the major theoretical bases for the relationship between female education
and fertility. Childbearing has been
hypothesized to decline with rising
female education because the value of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

women’s time (whether measured in
terms of wage rates or opportunity
costs) is greater at higher levels of education (Bean and Swicegood, 1985;
Mincer, 1963; Schultz, 1980). Among
minority women, including African
American women, the opportunity
costs of childbearing are thought to
increase disproportionately with rising
education, thus accounting for the
more inverse education/fertility relationship among African Americans.
To the extent that female employment plays a more critical role among
African Americans in contributing to
family economic well-being and to the
achievement of mobility aspirations,
working prior to the birth of the first
child may be selective of those African
American women with the highest social and economic mobility aspirations.
For this reason, the kind of fertilityreducing, compensatory behavior predicted by the minority group status hy
pothesis may be most likely to manifest

itself among women who work prior to
the birth of the first child. On the other
hand, it is possible to argue that African American women who are not
working at the onset of childbearing
have an even stronger motivation to
have fewer children.

A neglected aspect of the minority
group status hypothesis, but one that
follows from its emphasis on mobility
aspirations, is that social and economic
mobility aspirations for children may
play a role in generating African
American/white fertility differences.
The influence of this factor on fertility
in general, of course, has been incorporated into theories of fertility behavior through the idea of child quality
(Becker, 1981; Sanderson, 1976). The

Fertility Differences

223

notion is that couples with the highest
aspirations may have the lowest fertility in order to maximize child quality.
An important means of achieving
high child quality is the investment of
parental time in children, including
the time that is associated with the
mother’s not working. Among highly
educated African American women
especially, not working may thus be
selective to some degree of women
with the greatest mobility aspirations
(at least for their own children). In
this case, reduced childbearing, other
things being equal, might be most
likely among such women.

Another factor that may be important that has been neglected in previous research is the acquisition of additional education later in the life course.
Most studies have used years of completed education at the time of interview as the measure of female education. However, some women acquire
additional education after marriage.
Those who do may be especially disposed toward lower fertility in the first
place, or lower fertility may make the
acquisition of additional education af
_ ter marriage easier. In either case, ac
quiring additional education may be
associated with lower fertility, and this
possibility may vary by race, given the
greater importance of female employment for economic well-being in the
African American family.

To the extent that these kinds of
processes operate, we hypothesize that
a racial ‘“‘cross-over’’ pattern will be
most apparent when education is measured near the end of the reproductive
process. Because we include in the
analyses only women who have finished their wanted childbearing (see
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

224

below), this hypothesis means education can be measured later in the life
course as well as prior to childbearing.
(We acknowledge here that childbearing is increasingly occurring outside
of marriage.) In the case of female education measured at the time of first
marriage, we would not expect the
education/fertility relationship among
African American women to be so
strongly inverse, because the fertilityreducing effect of acquiring additional
education (or the education-enhancing
effect of having lower fertility) would
not yet have had a chance to operate.

Finally, we also investigate the possibility that improved opportunities for
African Americans in the 1970’s and
1980’s, perhaps reflecting declines in
discrimination occurring as a result of
the civil rights legislation of the 1960’s
(Harrison and Bennett, 1995), means
that the predictions of the minority
group status hypothesis may apply with
greater force to earlier birth cohorts
of women. That is to say, earlier birth
cohorts of African American women
may have been more subject to obstacles to the realization of mobility aspirations and may have been more likely
to compensate by reducing their fertility downward relative to comparable
whites than later cohorts which faced
less discrimination.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Our research objectives require a
data set large enough to accommodate
the detailed cross-classification of
women by race, employment status,
and education. As we explain in more
detail below, we treat education categorically in order to allow for the possibility of non-linear relationships and

in order to test for racial differences in
fertility by educational level. We also
need a data set containing the measurement of wanted and unwanted fertility. No single data source meets all
of these requirements. Consequently,
in order to conduct the analysis under
these constraints, we pool data from
the 1973, 1976, 1982, and 1988 National Surveys of Family Growth (hereafter NSFG).

The 1973 and 1976 NSFG cycles are
national areal probability samples,
each designed to be representative of
women in the reproductive ages for the
non-institutionalized population of the
coterminous United States who were
ever-married or were single with own
children living with them. The 1973
NSFG consists of 9,797 women and the
1976 NSFG consists of 8,611 women.
The 1982 and 1988 NSFG cycles have
very similar sample designs except
these later surveys did not exclude any
women based on marital status. The
1982 NSFG contains 7,969 respondents
and the 1988 NSFG contains 8,450 respondents.! The National Center for
Health Statistics over-sampled African
American women in each survey.

The sample for our analysis is restricted to ever-married women. We
concentrate on ever-married women in
order to capture the largest possible

1Swicegood, Morgan and Rindfuss (1984) examined the implications of pooling multiple national
fertility surveys, finding a high degree of consistency
both in variable measurement and in estimated relationships between variables across surveys. These
researchers concluded that it is appropriate to
merge these types of survey data sets into a single
data file for purposes of studying fertility (see
Mosher and Bachrach, 1982; Teachman and Schollaert, 1989 for substantive research examples pooling various years of the NSFG). We use unweighted
data throughout this analysis (see Teachman and
Schollaert, 1989, p. 413, for a rationale for this strat

sample of African American and white
women within the context of the idiosyncrasies of NSFG survey strategies.
For example, the 1973 and 1976 NSFG
cycles contained interviews of nevermarried women only if they had own
children living with them, meaning that
never-married women who had given
their children up for adoption or sent
them to live with relatives were not
covered in the survey. Because racial
differences in these propensities may
exist, it seemed to us preferable to reStrict the study sample to ever-married
women. Also, never-married women
(1982 and 1988 NSFG cycles) and single women with own children (1973
and 1976 NSFG cycles) were not asked
key questions necessary for a test of
our hypotheses.2 Because  postmarried women may confront different
employment constraints that might
modify the manner in which employment status affects the education/
fertility relationship, we estimated statistical models both for ever-married
and for currently-married women. The
results were similar for each marital
status sample; thus, we report only the
results for the ever-married group.
Women who had at least one child
were also selected for the sample. This
selection criterion was necessary because several of the theoretically important variables reference the birth
of the first child. We also selected only
women who said they intended to have

2The fraction of live birth events missed from the
pooled NSFG by not evaluating the fertility of never
married women is 8.4 per cent. We acknowledge the
importance of research aimed at understanding fertility occurring outside of legal marriages but constraints based on the wording of theoretically important variables (e.g., job before first marriage,
age at marriage, education at first marriage) makes
it unfeasible to examine the fertility of never married women in this study.

no more children (self-identified completed fertility), thus including in the
sample only women who were at risk of
having an unwanted birth.? This selection is necessary in order to study the
determinants of unwanted fertility
(Ryder and Westoff 1972). For the purposes of this study, we also assumed,
following Ryder and Westoff (1972),
that women have wanted births before
they have unwanted births. As a result,
we selected only women with temporally consistent birth (pregnancy) histories. This is a relatively small number
of events because in any given survey,
approximately 3 to 4 per cent of the
respondents indicated they had an unwanted birth before they had their
last wanted birth. In sum, our subsample consists of ever-married African
American and white women with consistent pregnancy histories who have
had at least one birth and had completed their wanted childbearing.
Restricting the study sample to
ever-married women who had at least
one child and who report having completed their wanted childbearing raises
obvious questions regarding the possibility of sample selection bias (Berk,
1983, p. 390). Because the study sample is significantly smaller than the
maximum possible sample available
from pooling all four surveys (13,738

3The “‘wantedness” of each birth is determined
by reference to each pregnancy interval. Respondents are asked a series of questions about the intentions, expectations, and plans regarding their
pregnancies. From this, we are able to establish
whether a given live birth was wanted or unwanted
at conception. We recognize that the wantedness of
a given pregnancy does not mean that a woman
wants or does not want a given child. In addition,
other researchers have disaggregated and have used
categories such as “intended” and “wanted” (e.g.,
Williams and Pratt, 1990). We do not make that distinction here.

226

respondents versus 34,827 respondents, respectively), we took several
steps to be sure that this selection did
not bias our results. Three preliminary
stages of analysis for selection bias
were undertaken, including (1) a comparison of the number of births for
ever-married women who had completed their fertility to the number of
births for ever-married women who
had not completed their fertility; (2)
the estimation of separate regression
models for ever-married women who
had completed their fertility and for a
larger sample including women regardless of their fertility completion status;
and (3) the estimation of a set of selection models, using Berk’s (1983)
techniques. We discuss the findings of
each step below.

First, note that the variables that
have the largest effect on the reduction
in sample size are future birth intentions and having at least one child (parity). The parity restriction does not affect the number of live birth events
captured in this analysis. Note also that
our study sample captures approximately 39 per cent of all women who
might have been in our sample from
the pooled data sets (see above). However, when we compare the number of
births to ever-married women who
self-report that they have completed
their childbearing to a similar sample
of women for whom self-reported completion of their childbearing was not a
selection criteria, we find that we have
captured in our sample 77.1 per cent of
all possible birth events. Thus, if the
issue is framed in terms of high events
in the sample instead of number of
women, the chance for bias is reduced.

Second, we estimated similar models for ever-married women who had

Burr and Bean

 

Social Biology

completed their childbearing and for
ever-married women without the completion criteria (Same two comparison
groups from Step 1). Our strategy was
to compare patterns of racial differences in wanted and unwanted fertility
by education level. The results (not
reported here but available from the
authors) show a very similar set of
outcomes, and indeed, the pattern of
fewer African American wanted births
as education increases is even stronger
than that reported below. However,
we report the results from the more restricted sample because this allows us
to include more of the relevant control
variables and follows more directly
from our theoretical arguments.

Third, following the logic of Berk
(1983, p. 394) and Jensen (1985), we
evaluated the potential impact of selectivity with a series of regression models
in a two-stage process (one set of selection models and one set of substantive models). In the first stage, we
estimated logistic regression models
designed to predict the probability of
sample selection. We assumed for this
analysis that the important characteristics for predicting whether a woman
had at least one child and reported having completed her childbearing (in
sample) versus whether she was childless or had not completed her childbearing (out of sample) was related to
her occupational status (professional
occupation or not), age, race, and marital disruption experience.

After estimating these models, we
saved the predicted probabilities of
sample inclusion for use as a covariate
(a type of instrumental variable) in the
second stage of the analysis for sample
selectivity bias. In the second stage, we
estimate a series of substantive OLS

 
Vol. 43, No. 3-4

regression models that include the
original variables as discussed in the
text and shown in Table 2 plus an additional instrumental variable that estimates each woman’s probability of
selection into the sample. Although
the ‘“‘hazard rate” variable was statistically significant in some cases, we
present the results of the substantive

In the NSFG from 1982 and 1988, the item on early
work experience is phrased as ‘‘work before first

to marriage in the earlier cycles is another reason
our analysis is limited to women who were evermarried. In addition, the question wording is not

treated as dependent variables. The respondent’s age, age at first marriage,
and exposure to the risk of an additional (unwanted) birth are considered
demographic control variables because
they are known to vary by both race
and education level and to be related
to completed fertility. In addition, we
control for racial differences in region
and residence patterns. Women living
in the South and women living in nonmetropolitan areas generally exhibit
higher fertility than women who live
in other areas, and African Americans
and whites vary in their tendency to
live in these areas. We also control for
religious affiliation in order to remove
fertility differences due to religious
composition.>

We estimate dummy variable regression models of the following form

for measures of education at two points

in the life course:

sDummy variables for year of survey are included in the regression equations to capture time
trends for the variables in the model. For example,
during the time frame of this study, it is well-known
that fertility was generally decreasing and female labor force participation was increasing. The reference category in the regression equations for the
time period dummy variables is 1988.

The means and standard deviations
of the variables included in the regression analyses are reported in Table 1.
On average, women who were not
working at the time of their first birth
report higher fertility than those who
did work, by almost one-third of a
child. Among women in the notworking group, 37 per cent were
African American as compared to the
working group in which 24 per cent
were African American. In terms of
higher education, a greater percentage
of women who worked before their
first birth reported at least four years of
college as compared to women who did
not work before the birth of their first

child. However, when comparing the
differences between education measured earlier in the adult life course
versus education measured at the end
of childbearing, not-working women
increased their representation in the
highest group by 250 per cent whereas
working women increased their representation by only 50 per cent. This
difference may be indicative of the notworking women delaying the completion of their education -as a result of
childbearing and child-rearing responsibilities.

The regression coefficients from the
models constructed to assess the race
by education effects on the fertility
measures among ever-married women
who worked and who did not work
prior to the birth of their first child
are presented in Table 2.° This table is
divided into two parts (Panel A and
Panel B). Panel A contains the regressions for our model with education
measured early in the adult life course.
Panel B contains similar regression
models with education measured later
in the life course.

The relationships among the independent variables and the measures of
wanted and unwanted fertility are generally as would be expected in both sets
of estimates (Panels A and B: the exceptions among the race-by-education
interaction effects are discussed in

6We have also estimated regression models of
the type reported here based on respondents’ current working status with education status measured
at two different points in the life course. It is interesting to note in the case of later employment
status (measured at the time of the interview) there
is no statistical difference for African American and
white fertility among highly educated women, regardless of whether total fertility or wanted and unwanted fertility are employed as dependent variables. Tables summarizing the estimates from these
analyses are available from the authors.

more detail below). For example, African Americans are characterized by
higher levels of both wanted and unwanted childbearing, as are Catholics,
and both of these patterns hold irrespective of whether the women worked
prior to the birth of their first child.
Also, levels of both wanted and unwanted childbearing generally decrease with rising education regardless
of when education is measured during
the life course, although the relationship is not always perfectly monotonic.
The contro] variables also behave as
would be expected. To take just two
examples, the number of wanted births
increases with age, reflecting the
higher fertility of earlier birth cohorts
of women. Also, net of exposure to
risk, the number of unwanted births
decreases with age, probably reflecting
the greater motivation of women in the
later stages of childbearing to prevent
unwanted fertility.

Our main interest is in whether the
pattern of educational differences in
fertility varies between the two racial
groups for the two measures of childbearing. We first tested for the significance of interaction effects on fertility
of race and education by adding the set
of race-by-education dummy variables
to an additive model containing terms
only for race, the control variables,
and the education categories. The results of these tests (for increments in
explained variance resulting from including the set of interaction terms)
are presented in Table 3. They reveal
that, for all three measures of fertility
among both women who worked and
those who did not work prior to the
birth of their first child, the education/
fertility relationship varies between
African Americans and whites. |

The race by early education (i.e.,
education at first marriage) interactions show a generally monotonic,
negative relationship with both wanted
and unwanted fertility, except among
unwanted fertility for women who did
not work before the birth of the first
child (Panel A).7 With this exception
in mind, these results are consistent
with much of the literature showing
that the fertility of African Americans
decreases with increases in higher education. A similar pattern of effects is
noted in Panel B except that when
measuring education later in the life
course (i.e., education after completed
childbearing) the negative pattern for
unwanted fertility also holds for
women who were not working earlier
in the life course. Thus, the effects are
more consistent across the two types of
fertility when education is measured
later in life. These effects are interesting but they do not in and of themselves show conclusively whether and
under what circumstances results involving wanted childbearing provide

7For the control variables and the education
variables, levels of statistical significance are estimated using a two-tailed test because we are not
testing specific theories regarding these relationships. However, for the race by education interaction effects, we are employing one-tailed tests of significance as we are testing specific hypothesis with
expectations about the direction of effects.

superior tests of the minority group
status hypothesis.

To more fully assess this possibility,
it is necessary to estimate the predicted
fertility of African American and white
women and compare the differences.
The nature of the patterns can be seen
in Figures 2 and 3, which present plots
of the relationships for ever-married
women by when education is measured
during the life course. For purposes of
comparison, we also provide plots of
predicted total fertility for each race
group. We see in the case of the total
number of births that the pattern for
both women who did and did not work
before the birth of their first child for
both measures of education involves
higher fertility among African American women at lower levels of education, with a steady diminished fertility
differential as education increases.

The total fertility of women of
higher education does not differ significantly between African Americans
and whites, as has been observed in
previous research. Interestingly, the
predicted total fertility occurring to
highly educated African American
women who did not work prior to first
birth falls below that of their white
counterparts when employing the early
education measure, although this difference is not statistically significant

(see Table 4 for a summary of the adjusted mean fertility differences along
with estimates of statistical significance). Thus, evidence based on the
kind of measure of total fertility used
in previous research instead of the
wanted and unwanted fertility components generally supports a “weak”
form of the social characteristics interpretation.

By contrast, the patterns of interaction effects for wanted childbearing
(presented in the middle graphs in Panels A and B of Figures 2 and 3) reveal
a “‘crossover” pattern among women
who worked, but this difference is statistically significant only when education is measured later in the life course.
African American women who worked
prior to the birth of their first child
have about one-tenth of a child less
than similar white women. This crossover occurs despite evidence from
other surveys that shows that collegeeducated African American women
on average experience their first birth
earlier in the life course than collegeeducated white women (Rindfuss,
Morgan, and Swicegood, 1988).

_ In addition, among women who did
not work prior to the birth of their first
child, an obvious cross-over pattern
occurs, and the differences are statistically significant regardless of when
education is measured. Hence, the
wanted fertility of highly educated African American women who did not
work prior to the birth of their first
child falls below that of comparable
highly educated whites. As shown in
Table 4, this difference involves a level
of wanted childbearing among highly
educated African American women
(as assessed by later education) that is
about one-third of a child per woman

 

Social Biology

less than that of a similar highly educated white woman. When education is
measured at first marriage, the difference is about four-tenths of a child.

We also tested for the greater likelihood that this pattern would characterize earlier birth cohorts whose
members undoubtedly faced greater
discrimination and barriers to the realization of mobility aspirations. We
found that this was indeed characteristic of the earlier but not the later cohort. Women born before 1945 showed
the race-by-education cross-over pattern in the case of wanted childbearing
whereas women born in 1945 or after
did not (these results may be obtained
from the authors upon request).

Turning to the pattern for unwanted
fertility, shown in the far right-hand
graphs of Figures 2 and 3, we observe
among African American women who
both did and did not work prior to the
birth of their first child that unwanted
childbearing remains higher at every
educational level than it does among
whites, although the differences tend
to decrease with rising education.
These differences are statistically significant and at the highest education
level range from one-tenth to one-third
of a child.

DISCUSSION AND
CONCLUSIONS

The results of this research hold a
number of implications for alternative
hypotheses about racial differences in
fertility by education. For example, the
results suggest the usefulness of taking
into account different fertility components when examining alternative hypotheses about the pattern of education effects on fertility. In some senses,

the results have implications similar to
those stemming from the research of
St. John and Grasmick (1985), whereas
their findings suggest that during the
early stages of the reproductive process
highly educated African American
women are more likely than similar
whites to engage in behaviors (e.g.,
earlier ages at first birth) that lead to
higher cumulative fertility, but that
during the later stages they are likely to
curtail fertility. It is important to note
that research examining cumulative
fertility, that is to say the number of
births at the end of the reproductive
process, may fail to detect such early
life course differences in fertility behavior between highly educated African American and white women.

Other research indicates that it is often useful to conceptualize each birth
interval as a separate point at which
couples make decisions about fertility
(e.g., Hout, 1978; Namboodiri, 1974).
In a similar vein, the results of this
study indicate different education/
fertility patterns by race depending
upon whether total, wanted, or unwanted fertility is examined. According to our definition, unwanted births
occur only after wanted births. This

‘means that the present findings support
the notion that African American and
white women not only confront constraints on childbearing that differ
across points in the reproductive process, but also that the two groups of
women confront different constraints

depending upon their levels of education.

What do these results imply for the
two major approaches—the minority
group status and the social characteristics hypotheses—that have most often been employed as explanations of
African American/white fertility differences by education? They provide
some support for each perspective.
Consider first the minority group status
hypothesis. The key and most interesting prediction of this hypothesis is that
African American women of higher
socioeconomic status will exhibit lower
fertility than white women of comparable socioeconomic standing (Goldscheider and Uhlenberg, 1969, p. 371).
The reason is not only because more
highly educated women have higher aspirations for social mobility than less
educated women, but also because African American women find their aspirations more difficult to realize owing
to societal patterns of discrimination.
To compensate, they lower their fertility in order to achieve and sustain socioeconomic goals. In the words of E.
Franklin Frazier (1957, p. 331), ““Men
and women who have struggled to
achieve a high position in the Negro
community are not inclined to have the
standards which they attempt to maintain lowered by the burden of children.”

In the present research, the finding
that wanted childbearing among highly
educated African American women
(regardless of whether they worked before the birth of their first child) falls
below that of similar whites indicates
that the mechanisms posited by the minority group status hypothesis may indeed operate to reduce the fertility of
some African American women below

that of similar white women. It is significant that a pattern consistent with
this hypothesis occurs in the case of
wanted rather than unwanted fertility.
Of the two components of childbearing
examined in this research, wanted fertility is more likely to reflect the influence of the kinds of demand-related
forces emphasized in the rationale behind the hypothesis. It is also noteworthy that highly educated African
American women who did not work
prior to the birth of their first child
show levels of wanted fertility that are
nearly a third to a half less than their
white counterparts. We theorized that
women who worked before their first
birth would be most disposed to behave in the manner predicted by the
hypothesis. Yet the general pattern
expected by the minority group status
hypothesis appears to be stronger for
women who did not work before the
birth of the first child. The appearance
of a race-by-education interaction effect among women from earlier birth
cohorts implies that the compensatory
processes posited by the hypothesis are
of greatest value for understanding racial fertility differences under the circumstance where greater discrimination may have occurred against African
Americans.

The verdict about the social characteristics hypothesis is similar. In its
“strong” version, the hypothesis predicts that differences in fertility between African American and white
women result entirely from differences
in other variables affecting fertility. In
its ““weak”’ version, the hypothesis predicts this finding only among women
of higher socioeconomic standing.
However, because it focuses only on
compositional effects, it provides little

basis on which to develop a priori expectations about where empirical support for it might be most likely to
emerge, thus illustrating one of its
fundamental weaknesses. The pattern
predicted by the “‘weak”’ version of the
hypothesis occurs only for total fertility, whereas the wanted and unwanted
components reveal different results.

It is of particular interest that the
unwanted childbearing of highly educated African American women remains (statistically) higher than it does
among highly educated white women
in three out of four cases, regardless of
early life work experience. In short,
even among highly educated African
American women we see evidence that
is inconsistent with the idea that such
African American women are completely ‘“‘assimilated,” to use the language of the social characteristics approach, into majority patterns of
reproductive behavior. Whether this
comes about because they practice
contraception less effectively (which
might be consistent with a ‘‘subcultural’’ hypothesis predicting higher African American fertility), or because
they have more limited access to the
full range of contraceptive options and
technologies available in the society,
is an important question for further
research. In either case, the pattern
suggests that the social characteristics
hypothesis is not fully adequate to explain patterns of differential fertility
between African Americans and
whites when the question is addressed
by taking into account separate components of fertility.

In sum, this paper adds to the understanding of race differences in fertility in five related ways: (a) we discuss
and test the two most common hypoth

239

eses in this area (minority groups status
and characteristics hypotheses); (b) we
combine data from four national fertility surveys, giving us adequate sample
size to allow confidence in the statistical differences among black and white
women at the highest education levels;
(c) we evaluate not only total fertility,
but we also provide a rationale for examining wanted and unwanted births
—defined at the time of conception,
not at the time of birth; (d) we generally find results consistent with our prediction that minority group status effects are most likely to emerge in the
case of wanted births; and (e) we push
the boundaries of this line of research
back in a modest fashion by introducing a straightforward birth cohort analysis, clarifying the findings of our original analyses.

Finally, we would note the policy
implications that follow from the results of this study. Socioeconomic status dampens fertility levels among all
race groups, but this research shows
that it is particularly salient for African
American women. Efforts to maintain
a level playing field with regards to educational and employment opportunities must be continued if African American women are to lower their overall
fertility to the levels of white women.
In addition, we have shown how differences between these two groups of
women are related to the higher rate
of unwanted fertility among African
American women of all education levels. To reduce the racial differences in
unwanted fertility, mechanisms for ensuring that contraceptive technology
continues to be relatively inexpensive
and widely available should be enhanced so that all women can better
control this aspect of their lives.
