Differential Fertility by Religious

Group in East Pakistan

The present study is an attempt to investigate differential fertility among Muslim, Caste, and Schedule Caste Hindus! in
East Pakistan. The existence of HinduMuslim differential fertility in the IndoPakistan subcontinent has been shown in
studies by Nag (1962), Davis (1951), Sinha
(1957) and Saxena (1965), all of whom
found higher fertility for Muslims than for
Hindus. A recent study in East Pakistan by
Stoeckel (1969) upholds these findings, although his data are for a limited area of
East Pakistan.

The one contradictory finding is that
reported by Duza (1967). In noting that the
fertility of West Pakistan which is predominantly Muslim is no higher than that
of East Pakistan which has a proportionately smaller Muslim population, Duza questions whether the positive relationship be

tween per cent Muslim and _ fertility
observed in previous studies continues to
hold. He suggests that social changes in
Pakistan during recent years have created
conditions which have affected the association between Islam and high fertility (see
Hashmi, 1963). Since his conclusion was not
based on a direct comparison of Muslim and
non-Muslim fertility and since he was unable to control for variation between East
and West Pakistan with respect to age at
marriage, infant mortality, and other relevant variables it is not possible to evaluate
his conclusion.

The present brief study examines the
level of Muslim natality in East Pakistan
relative to that of other groups, principally
Caste Hindus and members of the Schedule
Caste Hindus.

METHODOLOGY AND DATA

The study is limited to East Pakistan
and employs data provided by the District
Census of East Pakistan, 1961 (Government
of Pakistan, 1961). The greater religious
homogeneity of West Pakistan makes study

of religious differential difficult for that
province.

The ratio of children 0-9 years of age to
currently married and ever-married women
in the age group 20-39 has been used as an
index of fertility. Ratios of this type for
each religious group were computed for 17
districts of East Pakistan. The ratios were
two types: (1) Unadjusted and (2) Adjusted.
The Unadjusted ratios are those computed
directly from the census. The adjusted
ratios assumed a sex ratio of 1.06 for the
population aged 0-9, the adjustment being
for suspected underenumeration of children
below age 10. The logic of using the ratio of
children 0-9 years of age to ever-married
women in the age group 20-39 is entirely
dictated by the limitations of data. The
children in age group 0-9 are not the offspring solely of the ever-married women in
the age-group 20-39, but no finer classification of children simultaneously by age and
by religion is available. Similarly, the classification by age of ever-married women is
unsatisfactory, the alternative lower and
upper class limits being 10 and 59. The
ratios were computed in which the denominator was taken as ever-married women
aged 10-59 and 20-59, but the general
pattern of the results was not changed
appreciably.

FINDINGS

Mean child-woman ratios for 17 districts
calculated for Muslims and Hindus under
two different sets of data are provided in
Table 1. From Table 1, it is evident that
Muslim fertility is higher than Hindu
fertility under both unadjusted and adjusted sets of data, but the differences are
small and not statistically significant.”

In Table 2, the Hindus are subdivided
into Caste and Schedule Caste and their
respective fertility is compared with Muslim

2To test the difference in mean child-woman
ratios between religious groups, the Mann-Whitney
“uy” test was applied. The null hypothesis (H.) in

the test is that there is no difference in the mean
child-woman ratio between religious groups.

fertility. In Table 2, we find that the Caste
and Schedule Caste Hindus have the highest
and lowest fertility respectively, and the
Muslims have the intermediary position
under both sets of data.

We move a step closer to reality in Table
3 where the denominator is broadened to
include ever-married women and_ thus
makes allowance for a higher proportion
married among Muslims in the age group
20-39. Table 3 shows that the Muslim
child-woman (ever-married) ratio is higher
than either Caste or Schedule Caste Hindus
under both sets of data. The difference in
fertility between Muslim and Caste Hindus
is not statistically significant, whereas the
difference in fertility between Muslim and

DISCUSSION

Various reasons can be adduced for the
differences which have been observed, but
the question remains: How .can fertility
differences be detected separately from differences due to differences by religious
groups in the quality of the data or in
mortality? And if the data actually reflect
fertility differences, what factors produce
the differences?

The present study could not provide any
clue as to whether or not the differential
fertility is due to the effect of differential
mortality or differences in the quality of
data by religious groups. In the absence of
such knowledge, one would tend to accept
the data as reflecting fertility differences.
The findings showed the highest fertility
for the Muslims in comparison to Schedule
Caste and Caste Hindus when the childwoman ratio is confined to ever-married
women, and the Muslim fertility is found to
be the highest in comparison to Hindus as a
whole. The findings consistently showed
lowest fertility for the Schedule Caste
Hindus.

How can these differences be accounted
for? The present study could not provide

Social Biology

any empirically verified evidence as to the
explanation of lowest fertility for the
Schedule Caste Hindus, but it can provide
some evidence to explain the Hindu-Muslim
differential fertility as a whole. The Muslims
higher fertility can possibly be explained by
the following conditions: (1) higher proportion of women enjoying lengthy conjugal
life; (2) higher infant mortality; (3) unfavorable attitudes toward family planning;
and (4) less ritual abstinence.

The longer experience of married life by
Muslim women and shorter experience by
Hindu women has been shown in a study by
(Khan, 1964) in a rural area of East Pakistan. Khan found the average age of married
women in a Hindu village as 35 years with
22 years of married life; the corresponding
figures for the Muslim women are 40 and
27 years, respectively. This can also be
verified by the census data of 1961. Of the
ever married women among the Muslims
in the age group 20-39, only 5.2% are
widowed and 0.9% are divorced; the rest,
93.2%, are currently enjoying married life.
In the same age-group among the Caste and
Schedule Caste only 88.7% and 87.6%
respectively are currently enjoying married
life and the rest, 10% to 12%, are widowed
and divorced. Thus, a higher proportion of
Muslim women are exposed to pregnancy
for a longer period due to an extended
marital experience, which can partially
explain the higher Muslim fertility.

Higher Muslim fertility can also be explained in terms of higher infant mortality.
The infant mortality rate estimated from
the Population Growth Estimation Centre
data for Muslims in 1965 was 103 per
thousand, and for Hindus it was 90 per
thousand, Perhaps this high infant mortality rate leads Muslims to have more children
to compensate for loss or possible loss of a
child. Also, the Muslims may have less
favorable attitudes toward family planning.
A recent study in rural East Pakistan by
Stoeckel and Choudhury (1969) has found

Vol. 18, No. 2

that only 3.8% of the Muslims are currently
practicing family planning, while the proportion of Hindus currently practicing
family planning is almost three times as
great (10.4%). Also, 90% of the Hindus who
have ever practiced family planning are
still practicing, compared with only 60%
of the Muslims. In addition, the Muslims
observe less ritual abstinence than Hindus
(Kirk, 1965). These factors interacting with
others perhaps explain the higher fertility
of the Muslims.

The study could not provide any evidence to explain the fact that the lowest
fertility pertains to the Schedule Caste
Hindus. Some speculations or hypotheses
might be: (1) higher mortality at the
younger ages among the Schedule Caste;
(2) reduced fertility due to malnutrition or
dietary habits; (3) undercounting of younger children; (4) higher proportion widowed;
(5) adherence to traditional Hindu norms
such as observance of ritual abstinence, long
postpartum abstinence, and late physical
consummation of marriage. These factors in
part or in combination may explain the
lower fertility of the Schedule Caste Hindus,
but their validity is contingent upon empirical verification.

SUMMARY

According to child-woman (ever-married)
ratio, Muslim natality is found to be the

191

highest in comparison to Caste and Schedule
Caste Hindus. The relatively lower fertility
of Muslims in comparison to Caste Hindus
found according to child-woman (currently
married) ratio is due to a disproportionate
number of currently married women in the
age group 20-39 between Muslims and
Caste Hindus.

The findings throughout uphold the lowest fertility as pertaining to the Schedule
Caste Hindus, and this is the most significant finding of the study, The other important finding of the study is that the Caste
Hindus’ fertility does not differ significantly
from Muslim fertility.

CONCLUSIONS

The findings of this brief study do not
bear any testimony to the fact that the
Muslims show any change from their former
fertility behavior and do not therefore support the suggestion of Duza (1967, p. 115)
that “recent social changes in Pakistan have
created a condition in which the previous
findings of a positive association between
high fertility and Muslim population no
longer exists.”
