Age Differences Between Spouses in First Marriages

ABSRACT: Vital statistics data indicate that the age difference between spouses in first marriages
has narrowed for those born between 1931 and 1951 and married by age 25. It appears that the
largest declines have occurred at the older ages of marriage, although there have been reductions at all ages. The possibility that the narrowing of the age gap can be attributed to the recent
“marriage squeeze” is examined using data from the 1976 National Survey of Family Growth.
Insofar as it is adequately measured, the squeeze is found to be insignificant. It seems that age at
marriage of the wife is inversely related to a couple’s age difference. That this might simply be
due to the age distribution of available men is considered and rejected. It is speculated that the
relation between age difference and age at marriage is a consequence of changing preferences,
not of the supposed shortage of suitable single men.

That most men marry women younger than themselves is recognized, but
frequently ignored by many who study
nuptiality patterns in the United States.
Perhaps because this age norm of mate
selection is believed to be so strong, few
demographers have made it a focus of
their attention. Undoubtedly the absence of the appropriate marriage data
is an impediment to the study of this subject. Thus, many who have written on
the topic have resorted to aggregate census data on changes in differences between the median ages at marriage of
each sex over time, or a distribution of
differences at one point in time (Carter
and Glick, 1976; Presser, 1975).

This paper describes the trends in age
differences for those born between the
early 1930’s and early 1950’s and examines factors which might account both
for the apparent changes that have occurred during the period when these
birth cohorts were at risk of marriage

and for the differentials that exist at any
one point in time. Note that factors affecting age at marriage of each spouse
independently are not considered here.
That changes in the age difference do
not always parallel changes in age at
marriage suggests that it is reasonable to
examine factors affecting the age difference explicitly rather than factors affecting age at marriage (Presser, 1975).

To avoid any confounding effects,
the analysis is limited to those women
who have been married once to husbands who have been married once. The
fact that the size of the age difference
varies with the marital history of the
partners in part reflects the willingness
of older people—and the previously
married tend to be older than the
single—to choose a spouse from a wider
range of ages (Carter and Glick, 1976;
Presser, 1975). Also, the lower age
boundary of the previously married is
relatively high while the effective upper

229
230

age boundary for the never-married is
relatively low. Given that there aren’t
two clearly defined marriage markets,
one for those who have never been married and one for those who have, the restriction of the analysis to those couples
in primary marriages may be considered
somewhat artificial.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

= The 1976 National Survey of Family
‘. Growth (NSFG), a national probability
sample of 8,611 ever-married or single
© women with offspring of whom 6,066
A were married once to husbands married
© once, was the major data source. Other
> sources include the Vital Statistics from
co 1955, and 1963 through 1975, the 1970
= census, and the 1970 National Fertility
"= Study (NFS).
6 Problems emerge with much of these
"oO data. First, there is the complication
= that marriage data from the National
© Center for Health Statistics are incom“= plete and probably not representative of
© the United States as a whole (Carter and
‘= Glick, 1976; U.S. Department of
= Health, Education and Welfare, 1975).
= Prior to 1957, estimates and characteris© tics of marriages were only compiled by
& those states which had marriage report5 ing systems. Consequently, the figures
& for first marriage characteristics in 1955,
described later, cover only 23 states and
in 1975 cover 41 states.

The second problem is common to
analyses of survey data where temporal
change is the primary focus. Women
from the younger birth cohorts could
only be included in the survey if they
were married early. For example, a
woman born in 1955 who married at age
22 would be excluded from the sample
because she was married after 1976.
Thus, given the age limitations of the

higa

Social Biology

sample, the 1955 birth cohort was necessarily restricted to those who married at
age 21 or earlier, invalidating comparisons across cohorts. This censoring
problem was dealt with by establishing
an upper limit of 25 on the woman’s age
at marriage and then excluding those
birth cohorts for whom the limit was unattainable, i.e., those born after 1951.
The sample size was then reduced from
6,066 to 4,398. Only when comparisons
across birth cohorts were made, was the
sample restricted. Limitation of the
sample to women married at age 25 or
earlier is not without cost. Because age
at marriage has been rising, the women
who married at or before age 25 in the
1970’s are less likely to be representative
of the entire population of married
women than are those who married at
the same ages in the 1960's.

RESULTS
CHANGE IN AGE DIFFERENCE

The decline in age differences between spouses for couples where the
bride was no older than 25, can be seen
in both Table 1 and Figure 1 which summarize the NSFG data. (Short term fluctuations observed in Figure 1 are consistent with random sampling errors.)

Fic. 1.—Mean age difference by birth cohort.

Not only has the mean age difference
decreased by approximately one year
during this period, the variance has also
fallen. Moreover, the decline has occurred at all ages of marriage, although
the largest changes are at the older ages.
According to some demographers, the
decline in first marriage age differences
does not appear to be a recent phenomenon, but rather a continuation of a
trend that can be dated from at least the
turn of the century (Presser, 1975;
Carter and Glick, 1976). Those who argue that the age gap has been declining
for quite some time have cited the narrowing in the difference between male
and female median ages at first marriage
to support their contention. Although
the decline in the differences between
the medians is strongly suggestive of a
decline in the median or mean age difference, it is not conclusive. The difference between the medians only equals

the median difference when a distribution is symmetrical, in which case the
median equals the mean. Yet, it is the
median and/or the mean difference that
is of interest. Furthermore, the census
bureau in an attempt to furnish a cohort
measure of the median age of marriage
rather than one which is age distribution
dependent can only provide an estimate. It is this figure, calculated by estimating the proportion of young people
who are expected to get married, taking
half of this expected proportion and
then computing the age at marriage of
those who are at this halfway point,
which is offered as evidence for the
above arguments. An additional complication with the census figures on median age at first marriage is that first
marriages for the females may not be
first marriages for their spouses, and
vice versa (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1980).

Factors AFFECTING THE
DECLINE IN AGE DIFFERENCES:
THE MARRIAGE SQUEEZE

What has caused the narrowing of the
age gap described above? Demographers have speculated that an increase
in cohort size, resulting some twenty
years later in a deficit of men of marriageable age, might induce women to
marry men nearer their own age than
the norms or preferences prescribed
(Carter and Glick, 1976), or to produce
temporary changes in marriage rates
(Akers, 1967). Such a marriage squeeze
has been experienced by many of the
women in the NSFG. Table 1 indicates
that the cohorts which tend to have the
smallest mean difference are those of
the baby boom, 1946-51, the cohorts
which were supposedly the most
squeezed. Can the reduction in the age
differential between spouses be attributed to this marriage squeeze? Or, is it
an independent phenomenon indicative
of a change in social norms?

In order to measure the effect on age
differences of a surplus of women of
marriageable age, a squeeze ratio was
created using data from the 1955 marriage cohort, a cohort which because it
was not squeezed, was thought to reflect
the desired age difference preferences
(see Muhsam, 1974, for a similar type of
procedure). This ratio, based on the frequency distribution of age differences
for those in the 1955 marriage cohort
who married at age 25 or younger, was
calculated for each birth cohort. Table 2
displays the 1955 age difference relative
frequencies.

Due to the fact that the published
data from the 1955 Vital Statistics on age
at marriage of bride by groom, have
five- and ten-year age groups above age
34, approximately 1 per cent of the mar

riages of brides aged 25 and under were
excluded from the computation of age
difference frequencies. However, given
that few women who married between
the ages of 15 and 25 had spouses aged
34 and above, the resulting bias, if any,
is small.

For a given cohort the squeeze is
defined by the following equation:

1
S(t) = Clo (SWE)CU-B)

where S(t) is the squeeze measure for
cohort ¢, C(#) is the size of cohort ¢, 8 is
an age difference, and w(5) is the relative frequency or weight for that age difference. The squeeze measure then, is
the ratio of the size of the cohort in question to the weighted average size of its
neighbors, the weight being that fraction of women in the adjusted sample
who marry at the corresponding age difference.

Vol. 33, No. 3-4

A regression model was specified
with age difference as the dependent
variable and squeeze as the independent
variable. The following equation was
then estimated using the NSFG data:

AD =6.79-4.11S0Q,
(t=7.72)

where AD is age difference and SQ is
squeeze. The squeeze coefficient in this
model is significant at better than the
0.001 level. Moreover, both the sign and
the size of the coefficient are reasonable, given the range of squeeze from
0.90 to 1.22 and the range of age difference from 1.7 to 3.5. However, because
the squeeze was increasing during most
of the period under consideration (only
in the last three years does it take what
appears to be a true downward course)
and age differences were narrowing, it
was thought to include a time trend variable. Could the observed relation between squeeze and age difference be
due to a common dependence on time
rather than a causative association?
When time was included in the model

. the following regression equation was

estimated:

AD =126.33-0.95SQ—0.06TIME,
(t= 1.30) (t= 6.26)

where TIME is the year of marriage.
Once the time trend is extracted,
squeeze becomes insignificant.!

‘Note that throughout this paper regressions
are reported without R?. Values for R? are below
0.05. This is to be expected. An attempt is not really being made to explain the behavior of individual women; rather, reasons for the changes in aggregate data are sought. When cohort mean age
difference is regressed against squeeze and time,
the R? is over 0.7. However, the coefficients are
virtually unchanged. Individual data are used to
ensure the correct weighting in regressions.

Age Differences Between Spouses 233

It is conceivable that the marriage
squeeze was insignificant simply because of the way in which it was measured. The results obtained could be an
artifact of the measure used. The 1955
distribution of age differences used to
calculate the squeeze can be said to
reflect the preferences of those women
married in 1955, but not those married
since then. Ideally if social norms or
preferences are changing with regard to
age differences, the parameters in the
squeeze measure should change also.
Here they don’t. One has begun with
the hypothesis that norms are constant
and found this assumption to be inconsistent with the data: reductio ad absurdum.

However, even when the parameters
for the squeeze measure were altered either using spouse age differences for
those in the sample married between
1974 and 1976, or using the distribution
from the entire sample, the coefficient
for the squeeze variable hardly changed
(results not shown). Regardless of the
direction and the magnitude of modification, if the parameters are kept
within reason it is difficult to see how the
squeeze coefficient could become very
significant, or for that matter, significant
at all. Incidentally, Presser, who relied
on secondary data sources and did not
attempt to measure the effect of
squeeze, concluded that “the declining
trend in the difference in age at marriage
did not accelerate in the 1960’s when the
‘marriage squeeze’ developed”
(Presser, 1975, p. 191).

THE CHANGING STATUS
OF WOMEN

If the decline in age differences between spouses is not directly attributable to the marriage squeeze, then perhaps it is due to a more strictly social
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

234

rather than purely demographic phenomenon. The changing role of wornen
in society has been thought to have altered the norms about age differences
between spouses (Presser, 1975). Those
who hold more traditional attitudes towards women’s roles are said to be more
likely to marry older men than their less
conventional counterparts. Women
may inarry older men because of a desire for financial and emotional support
that could be more readily acquired
from a husband who had time to both
mature and to gain economic security.
The changing role of women in society
may have undermined these norms.

Ati increase in women’s educational
attainment is one indication of the transformation of sex roles. If at any one time
the size of the age gap between a husband and a wife is a function of the
amount of education the wife has had,
thertit is conceivable that the increase in
women’s education has led to the decline in age differences. Elder and
Rockwell (1976) found that welleducated women in the 1925-29 birth
cohort who married late were more
likely to marry younger men than were
less educated women. The desire for
these women to achieve educational
“homogamy” apparently overrides the
social pressure to marry an older man. Is
it late marriage which causes a woman
to marry a younger man or the amount
of education she has had? That is, 1s education significantly related to age differences after age at marriage is controlled
for? When age difference was regressed
on education, the following equation
was estimated:

AD =4.42-0.16EDUC,
(t= 10.73)

where EDUCis years of education. The

Mensch

Social Biology

estimated coefficient has the expected
sign and is significant at better than the
0.001 level. However, adding age at
marriage reduces the magnitude of the
education coefficient. With age at marriage included, the following regression
equation was estimated:

AD=7.16—0.07EDUC~—0.20MAR,
(t= 4.09) (t= 13.16)

where MAR is age at marriage. Clearly,
controlling for age at marriage minimizes the importance of education as an
explanatory variable. The main reason
it appears that highly educated women
marry men closer in age to themselves
than their less educated sisters is because women who stay in school marry
later. Cross-tabulations indicate that
those women who have not attended
college but have delayed marriage to
their middle or late twenties are barely
distinguishable from those who have acquired more education (results not
shown). Correspondingly, the age gap
between spouses is large for couples
where the woman married early regardless of how much education she has had..

WomMeEN’s ATTITUDES AND AGE
DIFFERENCES

In an attempt to identify a direct relation between women’s attitudes and age
differences, data from the 1970 National
Fertility Study, a national probability
sample of ever-married reproductiveage women, were examined. The study
included questions on women’s rights
and roles in addition to those on childbearing and marriage. The discussion
here is restricted to the 1,276 women
married between 1965 and 1970, in order to get at the attitudes which prevailed as close to the time of marriage as
was possible.

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

Vol. 33, No. 3-4

Each of the 17 questions on women’s
rights and roles was analyzed separately
to see whether the age differences of
those women who gave more, and those
who gave less, traditional responses varied in any consistent fashion. Three
questions which addressed the issue of
sexual equality, one which addressed
male/female roles and another male/
female behavior, provided some support for the hypothesis that the more
traditional the woman, the larger the
age difference (results not shown). For
example, respondents who strongly supported the notion that women should receive equal consideration for all jobs
had a mean age difference of 2.1, while
those who disagreed strongly had a
mean age difference of 2.5. The mean
age difference was 1.8 for those who
strongly agreed that young girls should
be allowed as much independence as
young boys and 2.3 for those who
strongly disagreed. However, for most
of the questions concerning family and
career conflicts and others directed to
the feminist movement and familial happiness, the relation was either very
weak, nonexistent, or reversed. Once
age at marriage is included, whatever relation there was disappears. Only because a greater proportion of those having nontraditional attitudes marry late,
does there appear to be an association
with age differences.

It may be that the questions asked do
not elicit the appropriate attitudes. Furthermore, women’s responses to these
questions may not correspond to their
marital behavior. Some may have embraced the slogans of the women’s
movements without altering their
actions. In addition, while an attempt
was made to get at the attitudes at the
time of marriage, this may not have
been achieved. Even six months of mar
Age Differences Between Spouses 235

Tiage may transform a woman’s attitudes.

AGE AT MARRIAGE

From the above discussion it is evident that those marrying late are more
likely to marry men closer in age to
themselves than those marrying early.
When age difference was regressed only
on age at marriage the following equation was estimated:

AD=6.85 -—0.22MAR.
(t= 16.54).

It appears that the rising age at marriage
is responsible for some of the narrowing
in age differences. But because age differences have declined at each age of
marriage, this is only a partial explanation. As can be seen in Figure 2, which
summarizes Vital statistics data, the relation between these variables has been
transformed between 1963 and 1975.
For the 1963 marriage cohort there is a
weak association between the two variables. Women who marry after age 20 are
not really distinguishable from each
other. By 1969 the relation between age
at marriage and age differences has become somewhat stronger. In 1975 the
age difference is very dependent on age
at marriage. The NSFG data display a
similar transformation but because of
the necessary age restrictions, and the
smaller sample, the graph is not as illuminating. The NSFG data do show that
the Pearson Correlation Coefficient between age at marriage and age difference for women married between 1960
and 1965 was —0.09, while for those
married between 1970 and 1976 it was
~0.22.

Why has there been a change in the
mate selection behavior among women
who marry at age 21 or later? Women

< weight is given to the results from the

above attitudinal questions, it can be argued that many women were affected—
either directly or indirectly—by the
movement’s claims. These women may
have thought it desirable to acquire their
own security and status independent ofa
man’s. As a consequence, a larger number began to postpone marriage. For
these women the decision of when to get
married occurred prior to meeting their
chosen mate. But once they decided to
marry, many were willing to wed men
very close in age or even younger than
themselves. They may not have needed
to marry considerably older men, because they may not have needed the

protection and support that an older
man can ostensibly provide. In contrast,
women who delayed marriage twenty
years ago probably had attitudes toward
men and marriage that more closely corresponded to those who married early
than to those who presently delay marriage.

Another explanation can be proposed for the transformation in the relation between age at marriage and age
differences. Given that men rarely
marry before age 18, the possibility for
change in age differences at the younger
ages is limited. Perhaps, then, an agespecific explanation for the decline
should not be sought. Earlier it was
claimed that the decline in age differences cannot be ascribed to the marriage
squeeze. Evidence for this is that the de
 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 33, No. 3-4

cline continued while the squeeze on
women diminished. However, the explanation may be more complicated. It
is possible that the squeeze did precipitate a narrowing in age differences. This
may have had the effect of undermining
the norms, and once weakened, there
was no reversion to larger age differences despite the appropriate men being
in much greater supply.

AGE AT MARRIAGE AND THE
AVAILABILITY OF MEN

It has been argued that the interval
between couples narrows as the age of
the bride increases, because the pool of
available older men becomes increasingly limited with the postponement of
marriage (Elder and Rockwell, 1976). Is
an older bride more likely to marry a
younger man because of this alleged demographic constraint, or is it that her
preferences have altered as she has
aged? These two possibilities are neither
mutually exclusive nor independent. A
woman may respond to a shortage of eligible older mates by modifying her
choices with respect to age differences.
This problem was not addressed here.
However, the more restricted question
of whether a woman’s choices have
changed irrespective of the cause was
examined.

An attempt was made to investigate
whether the inverse relation between
age differences and age at marriage was
simply due to the dwindling supply of
older men. If this were the case it could
be concluded that a woman’s preferences are independent of age at marriage, that is, they do not change as age
at marriage increases. A simplistic
model was developed based on the null
hypothesis that the probability of a
woman marrying a particular single man
that she knows depends only on the age

Age Differences Between Spouses

237

difference between them. Therefore,
the likelihood that a woman marries ata
certain age difference is proportional to
the number of single men at that age difference, weighted by a factor expressing
the woman’s preferences. This assumes
that all women meet the same age distribution of single men, that there is one
marriage market. For a given age at
marriage a theoretical mean age difference was calculated:

me =

ew (BM (a+ B)VEW (6) M (a+8))

where TAD(a) is theoretical mean age
difference, a is age at marriage, 8 is age
difference, Af(a+8) is the number of
single men at age a + 8, and W(8) is the
probability that a woman marries a man
at age difference 8, given that the same
number of single men are available to
her at all ages. Unfortunately the correct values of w(5) are unknown, and
the distribution of age differences for
the NSFG sample was used as a crude
approximation.

The calculation was then performed
using data from 1970. These data were
selected for two reasons. First, data
were needed on the number of single
men by age, and this was available from
the 1970 census; and second, by 1970 a
strong relation between age differences
and age at marriage had emerged. A regression model was specified with age
differences as the dependent variable
and theoretical mean age difference and
age at marriage as the independent variables. If the null hypothesis that choice
is independent of age at marriage
reflected reality and the true W(8)’s
were known, then the coefficient for the

theoretical mean age difference would
be one and that for age at marriage
would be zero. Given that the NSFG
distribution was used, the smaller age
differences were weighted more heavily, because for all women the number
of single men is greater at these smaller
differences. Therefore, the theoretical
mean age difference will be too small
and the regression coefficient will be
greater than one. However, it will be argued below that this does not undermine the conclusions drawn. The following equation was estimated for the
301 women in the NSFG sample who
married in 1970:

AD=2.59-0.14MAR + 1.64TAD,
(t=2.08) (t= 1.49)

where AD is age difference, MAR is age
at marriage and TAD is theoretical
mean age difference.

Given the values for theoretical mean
age difference, it is not surprising that its
coefficient is insignificant. As Figure 3
indicates, the relation between theoretical mean age difference and age at marriage is U-shaped. This is due to the fact
that the distribution of men which an
older woman faces is relatively flat,
whereas the distribution for somewhat
younger women falls off rapidly (see
Figure 4).

It is now clear what the effect of using
the correct W(8)’s would be. Since the
correct W(5)’s are weighted towards the
larger age differences, the age at marriage at which the flat distribution of

older men begins to be sampled will be
lower. Consequently, both the minimum theoretical age difference and the
upturn will be at a younger age at marriage. This will further weaken the argument regarding the supply of single
men.

There are two major criticisms of this
mode]. In the rea] world there are many
marriage markets differentiated by such
things as education, race, and residence.
Here, markets have been differentiated
only by age. There is the additional
problem of whether all single men are in
the marriage market. While here they
have all been considered eligible for
marriage, this may not be true. If these
ineligible men were removed, this might
dramatically reduce the theoretical age

differences at the older ages of marriage, thereby making the availability of
single men a plausible explanation for
the decline in age differences with age at
marriage.

CONCLUSIONS

Age differences have declined for
those born between 1931 and 1951 and
married by age 25 independently of the
marriage squeeze; yet neither the increase in education of women, nor their
change in attitudes as measured in the
NFS, appear to have induced the decline.

Age at marriage is the variable with
the greatest explanatory power. Age
differences narrow as age at marriage
rises. While age differences have fallen

at all ages, the largest declines have occurred at the older ages at marriage. The
relation between age differences and
age at marriage, while weak at the older
ages at marriage prior to 1970, is now
quite strong. Preliminary analysis suggests that the relation between these two
variables is a consequence of changing
preferences, not of the supposed shortage of suitable single men. That women’s choices change with age at marriage
is intuitively reasonable. A 24-year-old

man is more acceptable to a 26-year-old
woman than is a 17-year-old man to a
19-year-old woman.
