Comment on Sweet and Rindfuss

“Those Ubiquitous Fertility Trends: United States,

1945-1979”

Daniel R. Vining, Jr.

Sweet and Rindfuss report on fertility
trends that ‘“‘similar fluctuations were
found within every socially defined subgroup that we could examine” (Sweet
and Rindfuss, “Those Ubiquitous Fertility Trends: United States, 19451979,” Social Biology 30:127-139,
1983). So what were Coale (1965) and
Kirk (1969) saying when they wrote that
“During the long period when natality
was falling in the United States . . . for
most of that time or a good bit of it there
was a difference by socioeconomic class
in family size. People with higher education, incomes, and so on had smaller
families. During these 130 years the
trend looked like a statistical law, but
now that’s no longer true. During the
past 20 years or so, this situation has
been in the process of disappearing. Our
best estimate is that, quite likely, there
will be a positive association between
socioeconomic class and natality within
another decade or so. This is so partly
because everybody has access now to
means of controlling family size, and
even an unskilled, uneducated person
will be able to control it very well. So
that one could have come to possibly genetically significant conclusions after
possibly a century or more of experience, which would be by now wholly out
of date” (Coale 1965, p. 58) and “‘whatever the historical importance of fertility
differentials in the United States they

 

have been reduced since World War II
with the spread of birth control to most
segments of the population . . . by the
1960s there was not much difference in
completed family size by education and
hence little opportunity for dysgenic effect from this differential’ (Kirk 1969,
pp. 81-82).

J think they were talking about the
fertility rates of college-educated white
women. Completed fertility of U.S.
white women aged 35-44 with three or
more years of college education went
from 59 per cent of completed fertility of
the whole cohort 35-44 years of age in
1940 to 72 per cent in 1950 to 88 per cent
in 1960 to 89 per cent in 1970 but
dropped to 85 per cent in 1980 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1945, pp. 155~156;
1955, p. Sc-66; 1964, p. 100; 1973, p.
150; 1982, p. 49). These results do not
square with Sweet and Rindfuss’ (1983)
results. I am not sure why. Maybe, it’s
because Sweet and Rindfuss (1983) use
period fertility while Coale (1965) and
Kirk (1969) were thinking about cohort
fertility. They could be different but, in
any case, the results of Sweet and Rindfuss (1983) leave a different impression
from those of Coale and Kirk. I always
thought that the family size during the
baby boom was about the same between
college-educated women and noncollege—educated women, i.e., that
there had been a convergence. But
