Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico

ABSTRACT: The frequencies for the alleles I4, I®, 19, D, and d of the ABO and Rh blood groups
for populations from metropolitan Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, and from neighboring states in
northeastern Mexico were ascertained along with those from other populations thought to have
contributed to their genetic constitution, i.e., Mexican natives (Nahuas, Mexicas, and Tlaxcaltecans), Mestizos (from Mexico City), Western Europeans (Spanish, Portuguese, French,
and German), and eastern Mediterraneans (Sephardic Jews). Genetic admixtures and distances were estimated, and three dimensional diagrams were elaborated. It was found that the
populations that immigrated to the area area after 1940 are the ones that have received a greater
genetic contribution from Mexican natives. The populations thought descended from the immigrants that colonized northeastern Mexico four centuries ago were shown to have received a
high genetic contribution from Spanish, a lesser contribution from French, German and Portu
guese, and a low contribution from the Sephardic Jews.

The area of metropolitan Monterrey
in the state of Nuevo Le6n in northeastern Mexico was colonized between 1577
and 1596 by immigrants from Spain who
were a mixture of Spanish (31.7 per
cent) and Portuguese and Sephardic
Jews (68.3 per cent) from northern Portugal (del Hoyo, 1979), and they had almost no admixture with the nomadic native populations of that region (Cossio,
1925). During the next three centuries
there was some immigration of Spanish
and Mestizos from the central and
northeastern states of Mexico and of
some native Indians, mainly Tlaxcaltecans (del Hoyo, 1979). During the
French invasion, 1862 to 1867, some
Western Europeans arrived in the area
(Roel, 1958). At the end of the nineteenth century industrial development
was started in the Monterrey area, and
in 1910 the city had more foreigners than
any other city in Mexico, 2,366 of 78,528
residents. These foreign residents were

from the United States of America (53
per cent), France (13 per cent), Canada
(12 per cent), and Germany (6 per cent)
(Montemayor, 1971). During the Mexican Revolution, 1910-17, immigration
was from the northeastern states of
Mexico.

Immigration has increased since 1940
due to the industrial growth in the area.
During the decade 1960-70, nearly
400,000 immigrants arrived from states
of San Luis Potosi, Coahuila, Tamaulipas, Zacatecas, and from Mexico City
(Montemayor, 1971).

In order to determine the effect of
this mixed ancestral background on the
subpopulations inhabiting this metropolitan area, we calculated the genetic
distances for the various subpopulations
in the region and compared them with
each other; with other populations in
Mexico; and with populations from
other countries. In this way we assessed
the influence of differential ancestral

contribution on the degree of genetic diversity within a region and also evaluated the relative degrees of admixture in
specific subgroups with respect to a
defined ancestral population. Thus, the
impact of the demographic and political
history on the genetic structure of the region could be determined.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
YD
© In order to have genetic marker inQI ; ora
formation on a large number of individ
‘guals and avoid the problems of small
sample size, we electéd to utilize inforAmation about: the ABO and Rh(D)
blood groups which were already available from records. ‘We were able to ob‘tain information about ABO and Rh(D)

‘blood groups from the following popula‘stions:

1. 48,094 patients of both sexes who are
insured by the Instituto Mexicano del
Seguro Social (I.M.S.S.) of Monterrey, Nuevo Leén. Those persons and
their families work for different companies located in the metropolitan
area of Monterrey. Most of them belong to the middle and low-middle social class which constitute 66 per cent
of the population in the metropolitan
area. Most of them immigrated after
1940 and came mainly from the states
of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas.

2. 9,368 blood donors.

3. 3,561 blood donor candidates.

All persons in the last two groups are
registered in the Central Blood Bank
of the I.M.S.S. and recently immigrated to this area, coming from the
states of San Luis Potosi, Zacatecas,
and other states in the central and
south part of Mexico. They belong to
the lower social class which constitutes
18 per cent of the population.

4. 2,126 persons who had resided in the
area for more than 35 years and had
medical attention at a private hospital.
All of them belong to the upper

middle and upper social class which
constitute the 16 per cent of the metropolitan population.

5. 708 patients from the same private

hospital that were residents from the
states of Chihuahua, Coahuila and Tamaulipas. They belong to the uppermiddle and upper social levels.
It is thought that the last two populations are the most closely descended
from the immigrants who colonized
northeastern Mexico.

From these data, gene frequencies
for alleles D and d were calculated based
on the principles of Hardy (1908) and
Weinberg (1908) for population genetics, and the alleles of the ABO system
were computed with Bernstein’s
method (1925).

The gene frequencies from these five

populations give a good representation

of the diversity of gene pools of the subpopulations in the Monterrey area.
These five subpopulations were then
compared with six populations, selected
because they were thought to have been
historically important contributors to
the present-day population of Monterrey. These six populations, and the references from which the gene frequency
data were obtained, are as follows:

1. A combination of Nahuas (Rodriguez
et al., 1963), Mexicas (Arteaga et al.,
1952) and Tlaxcaltecans (Crawford et
al., 1974).

2. Mestizos from Mexico City (Arteaga et al., 1952).

3. Spanish (Rodriguez et al., 1963).

4, A combination of Portuguese from
north and central Portugal (Cunha and
Morais, 1956, 1959, 1960, Tavares,
1960; and SA, 1962) consulted in
Mourant (1976).

5. A combination of French (Khérumian et al., 1966a, b, 1967) and German (Helmbold, 1961) consulted in
Mourant (1976).

6. A combination of Sephardic Jews
(Hirszefield and Hirszefield, 1919;
Gurevitch et al. 1940, 1947, 1951;

Margolis et al., (1960) consulted in
Mourant (1976).

Using the data from these five derived subpopulations, and the six putative ancestral populations, admixture
estimates were calculated using the
techniques suggested by Adams and
Ward (1973). In addition, genetic distances between the populations are calculated using the method of CavalliSforza and Edwards (1967), and these
genetic distances were used to construct
diagrams which represented the threedimensional configuration of the eleven
populations. It should be noted that
with only three independent alleles in
the analysis, all the information can be
reduced to three dimensions and hence
can be readily represented on such a diagram. The use of such diagrams to investigate admixture was first outlined by
Pollitzer (1958). Both the admixture estimates and the distribution of genetic
distances were used to evaluate the relative contribution of the putative ancestral populations to the present-day subpopulations in the Monterrey area.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The gene frequencies of the alleles I“,
I, 1°, D, and d for the ABO and Rh(D)
blood groups of the populations included
in this study are shown in Table 1.

In this table it can be observed that
the alleles, frequencies in the populations from the metropolitan area of
Monterrey and neighboring states (Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Tamaulipas) are
intermediate between those of the native populations of Mexico and the
Spanish, Western Europeans, and Sephardic Jews, with the Mestizos from
Mexico City intermediate between the
northeastern Mexico populations.

the four major putative European populations which contributed to their
present-day gene pool. It was assumed
that the original gene frequencies in

can be approximated by the average
gene frequencies for the three native
Mexican populations (Mexicas, Nahuas, Tlaxcaltecas). The mean values
for these admixture estimates are given
in Table 2.

It appears that the Spanish population has been the most important contributor of foreign genes to the present

‘¢ Western European populations (French
8 and German) are similar and somewhat
Qless for most of the present-day populations. Conversely, it is clear that the

intermediate position with respect to
stheir relative degree of European ad‘mixture. By comparison, three of the

Le6n appears to have had a substantial
contribution from Sephardic Jews.

However, such individual admixture
estimates do not take account of the total information given by the relative genetic distances between world populations and thus can give misleading
results (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer,
1971; Adams and Ward, 1973). Accordingly, a more appropriate evaluation of
the total overall contribution of ancestral populations to the present-day population is afforded by comparing the distribution of genetic distances.

Pair-wise genetic distances were calculated for all populations and are presented in Table 3. With respect to the
presumptive ancestral population of
Mexico, represented by the three Mexican native populations, the most genetically similar populations are the Donor
Candidates and the Donors. Both of
these populations have recently immigrated to the northeastern region of
Mexico from the Central and southern
states, where the degree of European
admixture has been substantially less
than was historically the case for the
northeastern region. This genetic similarity between the two Donor popula

tions and Mexican native populations is
compatible with the results of the admixture estimates above.

The two most genetically similar populations are the Mestizo population and
the I.M.S.S. population, with the smallest genetic distances in the table. Hence,
the I.M.S.S. population can be regarded
as being representative of the “average”
Mestizo population, in terms of its genetic origin. The two private hospital
populations are also genetically similar
and are both substantially closer to the
European populations than any of the
other present-day populations. However, it will also be noted that these two
private hospital populations are substantially closer to the three European
populations than they are to the Sephardic Jewish population. This suggests
that the distribution of individual admixture estimates presented above is
somewhat misleading.

To resolve this issue, the genetic distances of the six present-day Mexico
populations were plotted onto a triangle
representing the genetic distances between three presumptive ancestral populations. One of these is always the presumed Mexican native population, the
second population being the Spanish, as
the most dominant contributor of foreign genes. The third population is one
of the other possible contributors, such
as Western European (French/German),
Figure 1A; Portuguese, Figure 1B, or Sephardic Jews, Figure 1C. After making
the plots, we observed that when the triangle is formed with the French and
German all the northeastern populations lie inside the triangle and the
private-hospital population from Nuevo
LeGn lies almost directly on the line connecting Mexican natives to French and
German, suggesting that these populations have genetically contributed in a

high degree to both populations from
the private hospital. This observation
can be supported when Figure 1B is analyzed, in which the Portuguese are considered as the third contributor population. In this triangle the two
private-hospital populations lie outside
and to the right of the Portuguese.
If the Sephardic Jews are considered
as the third contributor population, Fig
ure 1C, all populations lie very close to
the line connecting Mexican natives to
Spanish, suggesting that the Sephardic
Jews have had little contribution to the
northeastern Mexico populations.
Overall, these findings do not suggest
that the Sephardic Jews made a substantial contribution to the gene pools of the
various northeastern Mexican populations as was suggested by historical inDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

formation. It is fairly clear for the populations which have experienced smaller
levels of European admixture that the
Sephardic Jews have had little influence.
For the two private hospital populations, where European contribution to
the gene pool has predominated, the situation is somewhat more ambiguous.
The combined information from the
admixture estimates and the genetic distance estimates suggest that, while
southern European populations (Spanish and Portuguese) have had a predominant influence on the genetic constitution of these populations, another
ancestral population was also important. Judging from Figure 1A, it is quite
likely that the third contributor to the
gene pool of the two private-hospital
populations was from the Western European population, represented by

lations. On the other hand, it is possible
that the gene frequencies of Sephardic
Jews who participated in the early history of northeastern Mexico were different from the present-day gene frequencies used in this analysis. Hence,
the possibility of a genetic contribution
by Sephardic Jews to the private population can not be ruled out, though on the
whole, it appears unlikely.
