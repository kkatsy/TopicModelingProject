S ABSTRACT: Correlation between parents for a given characteristic substantively affects estimates of both genetic and environmental parameters. Spouse similarity for biological, adop© tive, and nonadoptive parents was examined in a study using a full-adoption design. With re5 gard to isophormic comparisons, moderate assortment was found for age, educational
© attainment, performance on tests of verbal ability, family background, and habits such as alcoe hol and current smoking behavior. The effects of cross-assortative mating on population covari& ance and cross-correlation between relatives are discussed. Although of considerable theoretical
= interest, little cross-trait assortative mating for personality and cognition was found in the
co present study, suggesting that its effects will not be large, at least for these variables. Because
"_ “assortative mating” may differ from “assortative marriage,” comparisons among estimates of
& ~~ homogamy for birth, adoptive, and nonadoptive parents were made. Results indicated differen
g tial assortment among the three types of parents for some of the variables examined.

oN
& It has been established that assorta=tive mating influences the correlation
‘Cbetween relatives and the genetic variance in a population (Fisher, 1918;
5 Wright, 1921; Crow and Felsenstein,
£1968). Because most adoption studies
have usually obtained little or no data
Sfor birth fathers, estimates of heritabil‘ity have been based entirely upon the
scorrelation between birth mothers and
‘etheir adopted children (Plomin et al.,
©1977). These estimates, however, may
be inflated if birth parents mate assortatively, since the parent-offspring correlation is a function of mate correlation.
Thus, the degree that birth parents mate
assortatively can influence estimates of
genetic parameters in adoption studies.
Similarly, the extent to which adoptive
parents marry assortatively will influence estimates of environmental parameters in adoption studies (DeFries
and Plomin, 1978).
Because most of the birth parents in
adoption studies were not married at the

 

time of testing, one might expect their
mating to be more at random or that
there is less assortment than in adoptive
or nonadoptive parents (i.e., a control
group of parents who are rearing their
own children). In addition, because
adoptive parents, for medical reasons,
did not conceive, “‘assortative marriage” may differ from “‘assortative mating” with respect to certain traits. For
these reasons, the degree of spouse similarity based on isomorphic (same trait)

_ as well as cross-trait comparisons was

examined in birth, adoptive, and nonadoptive parents who participated in the
Colorado Adoption Project (CAP), a
longitudinal study of behavioral development utilizing a full-adoption design.

CROSS-TRAIT ASSORTATIVE
MATING

Previous studies on assortative mating have focused almost entirely on iso- morphic comparisons (i.e., relating hus

band’s measure on x with wife’s
measure on x). Since assortment may
take place across traits (i.e., character x
{e.g., verbal ability] of the husband may
be related to character y [e.g., sociability] of the wife), cross-trait assortative
mating is also considered in this study.
Because the theoretical implications of
cross-trait assortative mating, to my
knowledge, have not previously been
addressed, the effects of cross-trait assortative mating on additive genetic covariance and on cross-correlations between relatives will now be briefly
considered.

EFFECTS OF CROSS-TRAIT ASSORTATIVE
MATING ON ADDITIVE GENETIC
COVARIANCE

It has been shown that the additive
genetic covariance between two traits
increases as a function of the cross-trait
assortative mating. It has been derived
(Ho, 1980) that for the bivariate case,
the additive genetic covariance at equilibrium is inflated according to the formula,

1—ry.p,

where Cov (A,A,) is the additive genetic
covariance of two traits x and y, ry - is
the cross-assortative mating correlation
between character x of the mother and
character y of the father, and v1 is the
number of relevant gene loci. These deviations parallel those of Crow and
Felsenstein (1968) for the univariate
case. For large n, the additive genetic
covariance at equilibrium is inflated according to the formula

Cov (A,Ay)
Cév (AA) = .
1—ry,F,

Ho

Social Biology

If the heritability of either x or y is less
than one, r (the phenotypic spouse
cross-correlation) must be substituted
by Ay,-, the spouse cross-correlation
with respect to genetic values, where

Ax,F, = (ry,F) (hy) .

Thus, the greater the extent of crossassortative mating, the greater the increase in additive genetic covariance between two traits.

EFFECTS OF ASSORTATIVE MATING ON
Cross-CoORRELATIONS BETWEEN
RELATIVES

It has been shown that the crosscorrelations between parent and offspring (e.g., father’s or mother’s x and
offspring’s y) is a function of cross-trait
assortative mating (Ho, 1980). Considering only the additive genetic values
(A) in a path diagram shown in Figure 1,
where m, and my, refer to isomorphic assortative mating correlations; m,,, to
nonisomorphic assortative mating correlations; r, , to additive genetic correJation between two traits; A, to the additive genetic value of father (Ar), mother
(Ay) or offspring (Ag); and m, to the
genetic correlation m, 4 =h,h,r,,.
That is, the additive genetic correlation
between mates is equal to the cross-trait
assortative mating coefficient weighted
by the square root of the heritabilities of
each trait. From the figure, it can be
seen that the cross-correlation between
additive genetic values of parent and
offspring is a function of cross-trait assortative mating. That is,

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Assortative mating coefficients were
calculated for 55 pairs of birth parents,
116 adoptive parents, and 76 nonadoptive parents. The latter is a control
group of parents who are rearing their
own children. These parents are predominately Caucasian and representative of the Denver metropolitan area.
The nonadoptive families were matched
to the adoptive families on the basis of
sex of the proband (the adopted child),
number of children in the family, and
age, occupational rating, and educational rating of the father. The parents

‘completed a battery of tests of specific

cognitive abilities as well as questionnaires incorporating personality assessments, background, and medical information about themselves and their
families. Descriptions of subject recruitment, testing procedures, and general

characteristics of the sample have been
previously reported (Plomin and DeFries, 1985). Pearson product-moment
correlations were computed for continuous and ordinal variables for both isomorphic and cross-trait comparisons.
Cramer’s V statistic was computed for
nominal variables, and their significance
was evaluated by a chi-square test. A
test of differences among the three correlations (see Snedecor and Cochran,
1967) was employed to examine differential assortative mating among the
birth, adoptive, and nonadoptive parents.

Although technically the terms assortative mating, assortative marriage,
spouse similarity, and parental similarity are not applicable to all three types of
parents (birth, adoptive, and nonadoptive), these terms will be used interchangeably in this report.

RESULTS

AGE, EDUCATIONAL AND OCCUPATIONAL
STATUS OF PARENTS

Table 1 presents demographic characteristics of the parents in the sample.
Note that the birth parents are considerably younger than either adoptive or
nonadoptive parents. It may also be
seen that the education and occupational status is on the average lower than
those measures for the adoptive and
control parents. These differences may
be due to the age differences among the
three types of parents or it may be due to
a sampling bias. The average education
and occupational status of the birth
grandparents, however, are comparable
to those measures for the control grandparents and actually greater than those
for the adoptive grandparents. Thus, according to these measures, there is no
evidence that the birth parents of the
adopted children in the sample are from
disadvantaged homes.

ASSORTATIVE MATING FOR AGE,
HEIGHT, AND WEIGHT

Table 2 presents the assortative mating coefficients for the birth, adoptive,
and nonadoptive parents with respect to
age, height, and weight. By far the largest parental correlation for any variable
under investigation is that for age. Because many traits, both physical and behavioral, change with development as
well as show secular trends, the effects
of age on other estimates of homogamy
was taken into account. Spouse correlations for age in the birth and adoptive
parents are well within the range reported in the literature (ranging from
0.50 to 0.99). A comparison of the correlations for age indicates that parental
similarity differs for the three types of
parents (p < 0.05).

The higher assortative mating for age
in birth parents may be because many of
the younger birth parents were classmates or met in school, and thus were of
similar ages. The higher age correlation

for the adoptive parents may be because
one of the criteria for adoptive parents is
that their combined age not exceed 75
years of age. These two descriptions are
not typically relevant to the nonadoptive parents and may in part explain the
lower age correlation for the nonadoptive parents when compared to birth or
adoptive parents. The correlations for
height for birth parents are lower than
those usually reported, although not
significantly so. Weight for the adoptive
and nonadoptive parents are similar to
other reports on American couples
(e.g.,0.14 as reported by Price and Vandenberg, 1980).

to find assortment with respect to grandfather’s (i.e., the relationship between
maternal and paternal grandfather of
the adopted or nonadopted child) edu

cation and occupation. There seems to
be some assortment with respect to size
of the home town for birth parents. Parental similarity for grandfather’s occupation is significantly different among
the three types of parents. The coefficient for adoptive grandfather is much
lower than that for birth or nonadoptive
grandfather. This difference cannot be
due to differences in variance since variance estimates among the birth, adoptive, and nonadoptive parents are homogeneous with respect to grandfather’s occupation.

ASSORTATIVE MATING FOR
OCCUPATIONAL STATUS, EDUCATION,
AND SPECIFIC COGNITIVE ABILITIES

Spouse similarity for the birth, adoptive, and nonadoptive parents with respect to occupational status, education,
general cognitive ability, and four specific cognitive factors are presented in
Table 4. With respect to their educational Jevel, there is moderate assortment for these parents. Note that these
correlations have been adjusted for parents’ ages. This magnitude of assort
Ho

ment is comparable to other studies. For
example, Johnson et al. (1976) reported
an age-adjusted coefficient for education of 0.46 for Americans of European
Ancestry. Price and Vandenberg (1980)
reported 0.48 for a sample of American
couples. The assortative mating coefficients for the five cognitive composite
measures (adjusted for age and educational level) are in general low, although
a few are significant. The higher degree
of homogamy found for verbal ability
compared to the other composites of
specific cognitive abilities is consistent
with previous reports. It has been speculated that verbal ability may be a more
socially visible skill than the other cognitive abilities and that those skills that are
most socially visible may be those for
which there occurs the greatest degree
of homogamy (Zonderman, 1974).

ASSORTATIVE MATING FOR PERSONALITY
MEASURES

of assortment with respect to the selfreported (age-adjusted) EASI personality measures and general mood (see Ta

ble 5). These results corroborate
previous findings of low assortment with
respect to personality measures (Price
and Vandenberg, 1980). It is interesting
to note, however, that the correlations
based on an individual’s report on her
(his) spouse tend to be higher than correlations based on each spouse’s selfreport. Moreover, these significant correlations are negative, giving some
support to the notion that “opposites attract.” Differential assortment exists
among the three types of parents for
measures of sociability and activity
(based on spouse’s report). This may

reflect some divergence with respect to
these personality traits in adoptive and
nonadoptive couples who are married
and likely to have cohabitated for more
years than the younger unmarried birth
parents.

hol consumption. The correlations for
adoptive and nonadoptive parents are
comparable to those reported for a sample of American couples examined by
Price and Vandenberg (1980). Differential assortment among parental types for
wine consumption may reflect convergence in adoptive and nonadoptive parents due to length of marriage. This explanation, however, does not hold for
current smoking.

CROSS-TRAIT ASSORTATIVE MATING

Assortative mating across traits was
examined for measures within as well as
between cognition and personality domains. In general, there is not much
cross-trait assortment. Several low correlations were significant, but the number of significant correlations was no
more than that expected by chance.

In addition, a canonical correlation
analysis was performed on 13 cognitive
tests to account for an underlying dimension of general cross-assortment for
cognition by maximizing the relationship between father’s set of cognitive
measures and mother’s set of cognitive
measures. There were no significant canonical variates resulting from analyses
performed separately on the three types
of parents.

DISCUSSION

This study examines assortative mating for various physical and behavioral
traits in a sample of birth, adoptive, and
control parents. Evidence for homogamy with respect to grandfather’s education and occupation indicate some assortment for social class. Significant
mate correlations found for educational
attainment and general cognitive ability, to some extent, also reflect assortment for social class. Since schools tend

Social Biology

to select persons largely with respect to
their intellectual abilities, the educational system may be most instrumental
in assortative mating. Individuals are
brought together in terms of aptitude
and family background which influenced the choice of a school.

The assortative mating coefficients
for the personality variables (based on
ratings by an individual’s spouse) provided some support to Winch’s theory
(1955) of complementary needs in mate
selection. That the estimates of homogamy varied with respect to the rating
method (self-rating vs. spouse’s rating)
was not surprising, particularly for personality measures. Because most of the
spouse correlations on personality in
past studies are based on self-reports
rather than on perhaps other more objective methods of rating, this may, in
part, explain why homogamy was not
usually found for personality measures.

The evidence for assortative mating
with respect to present smoking and alcohol consumption may be due in part
to the tendency for spouses to participate in these activities at the same time.

Besides examining assortative mating in the three types of parents because
of its influence on genetic and environmental parameters, the parents in this
study also provided an interesting data
source to examine differences in assortative mating and assortative marriage.
One might expect assortment among
birth parents to be lower than that for
adoptive or control parents if the pregnancies were resulting from casual relationships. With respect to the social
worker’s report, this generally seems
not to be the case. Nevertheless, differences with respect to the basis of assortment may exist since the birth parents at
the time of testing were not married; the
adoptive parents, for medical reasons

 
Vol. 33, No. 1-2

were not able to conceive; and the control parents have married and conceived. These analyses indicated differential assortment among the birth,
adoptive, and control parents for some
of the variables examined.

As previously discussed, assortative
mating can lead to increases in homozygosity and population variance, as well
as influence the correlation between rel
i, atives (Crow and Kimura, 1970). Since
= most of the variables examined in this
S study are probably polygenic, effects of
2 assortative mating on homozygosity are
® likely to be slight, whereas effects on
A variance could be large. If assortative
co mating for a highly heritable character is
= about 0.25, the genetic variance will be
co increased by one-eighth after one generation and will eventually be increased by
eg one-third at equilibrium (Crow and Kico mura, 1970).
As discussed, cross-assortative mat2 ing can likewise lead to an increase in
© population covariance and can influence
= the cross-correlation between relatives,
© Although of considerable theoretical in‘S terest, little cross-trait assortative mating for personality and cognition was
© found in the present study, suggesting
. that its effects will not be large at least
6 for these variables.
© If the heritability of a character in a
Srandom mating population is 0.6, the
single-parent/single-child correlation (in
the absence of common-family environmental influence) is expected to be 0.30.

Assortative Mating 85

However, if the spouse correlation is
0.25, the expected parent/child correlation is 0.375. Naively doubling this correlation would result in a substantia]
overestimate of heritability. Thus,
knowledge of the spouse correlation is
of considerable importance for estimating genetic parameters. Path models
that account for assortative mating have
been developed to estimate genetic and
environmental paremeters in a fulladoption design (Fulker and DeFries,
1983). Moreover, these models allow
for differential assortative mating
among the three types of parents.

Estimates of genetic and environmental parameters based upon correlations between relatives often assume
equilibrium conditions. Although equilibrium may be reached in a relatively
few generations under some conditions
(Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971), it
should be emphasized that models that
assume equilibrium for assortative mating are oversimplified. Further research
on the change or stability of estimates of
assortative mating and genetic variance
over several generations will be useful
with regard to this issue.
