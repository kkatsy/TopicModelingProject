Propensity of White Women in the United States
to Adopt Children

Dudley L. Poston, Jr., and Ruth M. Cullen

Department of Rural Sociology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York; and Department of
Sociology, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona

ABSTRACT: Demographically, adoption is a relatively rare event. In 1982, only 2.3 per cent (or
about 650,000) of ever-married white women aged 15 to 44 had adopted one or more children.
Adoption is an important and very relevant means of family formation for many women,
particularly those for whom biological childbearing is difficult or impossible. Although there is a
modest literature on adoption behavior, we have very little information about women who have
shown a propensity to adopt children. How should the phenomenon of adoption propensity be
conceptualized? How many women are there in the United States with such a propensity? How
different is this number from the number of women who eventually adopt children? What are
the characteristics of women with a propensity to adopt? The objectives of this paper are (1) to
estimate the numbers of U.S. women at three different points in time (1973, 1976, and 1982)
who have a propensity to adopt, according to various socioeconomic and demographic
characteristics; and (2) to compare via log-linear analysis the major characteristics of these

women with women who have not shown such a propensity.

Demographically, adoption ts a relatively rare event. Out of an estimated
26.1 million ever-married white women
between the ages of 15 and 44 in the
United States in 1982, only 2.3 per cent
(or about 650 thousand) had adopted
one or more children. The percentages
adopting children in the 1970’s were
very similar to the percentage in 1982.
Although relatively few women adopt,
adoption is an important and very relevant means of family formation for
many women, particularly those for
whom biological childbearing is difficult
or impossible.

While a modest literature has developed over the past decade about the
numbers and characteristics of women
who have adopted one or more children
(Bonham, 1977; Bachrach, 1983a,b,
1986; Poston and Cullen, 1986), this is
not the case with regard to adoption pro
pensity. We have very little information
about women who have shown a propensity to adopt children.

How does one conceptualize the phenomenon of adoption propensity? How
many women are there in the United
States who have such a propensity?
How different is this number from the
number of women who eventually adopt
a child? What are the characteristics of
women who have a propensity to adopt?
How similar are their characteristics
compared to women who have not
shown such a propensity, or to women
who have actually adopted one or more
children?

The purposes of this paper are (1) to
estimate the numbers of women at three
different points in time (1973, 1976, and
1982) who have indicated a propensity
to adopt, according to various socioeconomic and demographic characteristics,

167

and (2) to compare via log-linear analysis the major characteristics of these
women with women who have not
shown such a propensity. Research on
the characteristics of women who have
adopted has indicated that these women
usually are childless, noncontraceptively sterile, and in their late 30’s to
early 40’s. But similar studies have not
been conducted of women who have a
propensity to adopt.

To date we also do not have very
good estimates of the numbers of
women in the United States who are inclined to adopt a child. We do know that
in 1982 there were an estimated 51,000
adoptions in the United States by unrelated petitioners, a considerable reduction from the approximately 89,000
adoptions in 1970 (National Committee
for Adoption, 1985, p. 121). But to what
extent is the supply of babies available
for adoption different from the demand
for babies? Are there more women
showing a propensity to adopt than
women who actually adopt? Our objective in this paper with regard to estimating the potential demand for adoption is
an important and very relevant one, particularly because we will show that the
number desiring to adopt is quite a bit
higher than the supply of babies available for adoption. For example, we will
show in a later section of this paper that
in 1982 there were about 3.5 million
women who wanted one or more children but were biologically unable to
have these children. If only one-third of
these women eventually make actual
adoption plans, well over one million
women will be seeking children for
adoption. The supply of babies available
each year for adoption comes nowhere
near to meeting this demand. We turn
now to a discussion of the data and
methods to be used in our study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In order to estimate the levels and examine the characteristics of women in
1973, 1976, and 1982 who have shown a
propensity to adopt a child, we draw on
data from three cycles of the National
Survey of Family Growth (NSFG-I,
NSFG-II, and NSFG~III). In 1973 and
1976, these data sets were based on interviews administered to nationally representative samples of ever-married
women and single women (with children) between the ages of 15 and 44, and
in 1982, to a nationally representative
sample of all women in these ages. The
samples numbered 9,797 in 1973, 8,611
in 1976, and 7,969 in 1982. The interviews were administered “‘to produce
data on factors influencing trends and
differentials in fertility (and) contraceptive practice. ... (The interviews focused) on the woman’s marital and
pregnancy history, her use of contraception, future birth intentions, and a range
of social and demographic background
characteristics’? (Bachrach, 1983a,
p. 860; see also Pratt, 1977, Hendershot
and Pratt, 1979, and Bachrach et al.,
1985, for descriptions and technical documentation).

In both the 1973 and 1976 surveys, selected groups of women were asked
whether or not they would consider
adoption if they were unable to have a
child (or additional children) of their
own. The 1982 survey did not include a
direct question on adoption propensity,
but we have constructed a proxy propensity variable by drawing on questions in the 1982 survey pertaining to future birth intentions and desires for a
child (or additional children). As we did
in our earlier study of adoption behavior
(Poston and Cullen, 1986), we restrict
our samples in this study to currently

married non-Hispanic white women between the ages of 15 and 44 because of
the racial and ethnic differences in adoption behavior and voluntary and involuntary childlessness (Grindstaff, 1976;
Bonham, 1977; Poston and Gotard,
1977; Davis, 1982; Bachrach, 1983a,b).

In the 1973 survey (NSFG-I), approximately 6.6 million currently married non-Hispanic white women between the ages of 15 and 44 who
intended to have a child or additional
children of their own, were asked if they
would consider adopting a child in the
event they were unable to have their
own biological children. Women who
were sterile (either contraceptively or
noncontraceptively), menopausal, contracepting, intending to have a sterilizing operation, or who were pregnant at
the time of the interview, were not
asked this question. Almost 70 per cent
of these women, or about 4.6 million
women, were favorably inclined toward
the possibility of their adopting a child.

The 1976 survey (NSFG-II) asked a
comparable group of about 6.0 million
women the same question. Almost 71
per cent of these women, or about 4.3
million women, answered that they
were favorably disposed to the possibility of their adopting a child. In addition,
the NSFG-II survey also asked another
group of about 2.8 million women,
namely those who were noncontraceptively sterile, the following question:
“(Since/if) you and your husband are
unable to have a(nother) baby, do you
intend to adopt any children?” More
than 21 per cent of this second group of
women, or more than 600,000 women,
answered that they were favorably inclined to adopting a(nother) child.

As we have already noted, the 1982
survey (NSFG-II]) did not include a direct question on adoption propensity.

Propensity to Adopt Children

169

We thus developed a proxy measure by
constructing a single indicator from
questions dealing with future birth intentions and desires. Those married
white women who were sterile (contraceptively or noncontraceptively) at the
time of the interview were asked: “If it
were possible for you to have a({nother)
baby, would you, yourself, like to have
one?” Another group of women who
had not had a sterilizing operation, had
little or no indication of difficulties in
conceiving or bearing a child, and who
did not intend to have a sterilizing operation, were asked: “Do you and your
husband intend to have a(nother) baby
at some time?” This population includes
mainly fecund women, with much
smaller proportions of subfecund and
“long interval” women.! In our use of
this second group of women for the construction of the “propensity” variable,
we excluded the fecund women. Our
proxy “propensity” variable therefore
applies to all contraceptively and noncontraceptively sterile women who were
asked if they wished to have a(nother)
child, as well as to all subfecund and
“long interval” women who were asked
if they intended to have a(nother) child.
Combined, the two groups equalled
about 10.2 million women. Almost 34
per cent of these women (about 3.5 million) responded affirmatively, that is,
they either wanted or intended to have
a(nother) child.

Our proxy “propensity” indicator is
indeed a proxy because the adoption
process per se is not mentioned in either
of the questions used in its construction.

1A “long-interval” woman is one who has been
married for at least three years, has not used a contraceptive method, and has not been pregnant in
the three years prior to the interview.

However, we are assuming that if
women who themselves are unable biologically to have a child indicate a want
or intention to have a child, it is not unlikely that many of them are visualizing
adoption as the main mechanism for
achieving this goal. If they are biologically unable to have their own children,
how else could such an objective be attained, other than through adoption.
These descriptions of the three data
sets suggest that rather sizable numbers
of U.S. white women are at least somewhat inclined to have one or more children through adoption. In 1973, about
4.6 million women were so inclined; in
1976, the two groups of women indicating a propensity to adopt comprised 4.3
million women, and another 600,000
women; in 1982, our proxy measure of
adoption propensity identified about 3.5
million women who wanted to have another child but were unable to do so biologically. In the next section, we examine some of the general characteristics of
these women. These descriptive accountings will be followed by log-linear
analyses of a selected number of characteristics on adoption propensity.

RESULTS

Because of differences in the composition of the groups of women in the
three cycles of the national fertility surveys, and variations in the wording of
many of the questions asked in the interviews, we discuss, first, the characteristics of similarly constituted groups of
women in the 1973 and 1976 data sets
who reported that they would have little
or no difficulty in bearing a(nother)
child. These women were asked
whether or not they would consider
adoption in the event they were unable

Social Biology

to have children of their own. We then
describe the characteristics of the second group of women in 1976 who reported it would be difficult or impossible
to have a(nother) child. Since it was unlikely that they would have a(nother)
child, they were asked if they intended
to adopt any children. Lastly, we describe the characteristics of women in
1982 who wanted or intended to have
a(nother) child but who reported that it
would be difficult or impossible for them
to bear their own children.

DESCRIPTIVE CHARACTERISTICS

Selected characteristics of the groups
of women in 1973 and 1976 who would
have little or no difficulty bearing children (we refer to these women as
“Group 1” women) are presented in Table 1. In 1973 there were an estimated
6.6 million such women, and in 1976 an
estimated 6.0 million women; both
groups of women were asked about
their propensity to adopt. In both years,
about 70 per cent of these women responded favorably to the question, although the percentage answering “‘yes”’
rather than ‘‘maybe” declined from 51
per cent in 1973 to 44.4 per cent in 1976.
These total percentages indicate an
overwhelmingly favorable attitude toward adoption. However, there is some
variation in the percentages according
to certain characteristics.

With respect to demographic characteristics, potentially adoptive women in
both survey years tended to be young,
childless, and to have married at late
ages. Equally high percentages of fecund and subfecund women were favorably inclined with regard to adoption in
both 1976 and 1973, while in 1976, only
48.6 percent of women classified in the
“long interval” category of fecundity

Vol. 36, No. 3-4

status indicated a propensity to adopt
(in 1973 “long interval” women were included in the “fecund” category).

In addition to demographic characteristics, data are also presented in Table 1 for geographic characteristics (region and residence), woman’s education, family income and religion. Although there are variations in the percentages of women responding favorably to the question on adoption
propensity among the categories of all
these variables, the differences are not
great, suggesting that socioeconomic
differences are not as important in determining adoption propensity as differences dealing with age, parity, and fecundity. This, by the way, is a finding
similar to that for women who had already adopted a child or children (Poston and Cullen, 1986, p. 242).

Table 2 presents descriptive characteristics for those women in 1976 who
were asked whether they intended to
adopt since they were unable to have
children of their own (we refer to these
women as “Group 2” women). Of the
2.8 million women in this group, more
than 2 out of every 10 women, or an estimated 607,000, indicated a willingness
to adopt. For these women, the following characteristics appear to be important determinants of their propensity to
adopt: age at interview (women in their
late twenties and early thirties had
higher percentages willing to adopt);
biological parity (childless women were
more than twice as favorable as women
in other parities); and fecundity status
(noncontraceptively sterile and longinterval women tended to be more favorable than subfecund women). With
regard to social and economic characteristics, education and family income appear to have some influence. Substantially higher percentages. of

Propensity to Adopt Children 171

college-educated and higher-income
women were more favorable toward
adoption than were less-educated and
lower-income women.

Comparisons between the two
groups of women in 1976 who were
asked about adoption propensity indicate that, overall, “Group 1” women
tended to be more favorable toward the
idea of adoption than “‘Group 2”
women. This difference may well be
reflecting the hypothetical wording of
the question to women who had little
reason to think they would have difficulty bearing their own children, i.e.,
the “Group 1” women. Despite differences in question wording and the composition of the two groups, however,
younger, childless women in both
groups had the highest percentages favorable toward adoption, suggesting
that these characteristics may be important determinants of willingness to consider adoption.

As we noted earlier in this paper, the
1982 NSFG did not ask women whether
they would consider adoption if they
were unable to bear children of their
own. We therefore constructed a proxy
measure from questions dealing with future birth intentions and desires. Table 3
presents data on the characteristics of
these women identified in the 1982
NSFG. Of the 10.2 million women who
responded, almost 34 per cent, or an estimated 3.5 million women, answered
affirmatively. As was the case with
women in the 1973 and 1976 surveys, the
highest percentages of women who
wanted or intended to have a(nother)
child were the younger, childless
women. Within categories of fecundity
status, 55 per cent of noncontraceptively
sterile women, and almost 65 per cent of
subfecund women, wanted or intended
to have a child or additional children.

"This question was restricted to women for whom it would be difficult, if not impossible, to have a(nother) child: “(Since/If)
you and your husband are unable to have a(nother) baby, do you intend to adopt any children?” In the text we refer to these

women as ““Group 2” women.

Moreover, 21 per cent of the contraceptively sterile women, and more than 30
pe. cent of women in the long-interval
category of fecundity status, also responded affirmatively. Regarding age at
first marriage, the percentages wanting
or intending a(nother) child were highest for those married in their early or
mid teens, declined for those married in
their late teens and early twenties, then
increased again for those married in
their late twenties and thirties.

Data on region and area of residence
indicate that about one-third of the
women, irrespective of their region or
area of residence, wanted or intended a
child or children of their own. There was
considerable variation in family income
levels in the percentages of women responding favorably to future birth intentions. Women who reported family income levels between $5,000 and $9,999
had the highest percentage (59.1 percent), while women reporting family incomes over $25,000 had the lowest percentage (29.7 percent). With respect to
education, the 1982 data reveal a pattern that is the reverse of that found in
the 1973 and 1976 surveys. In 1982, 56.9
percent of those women with less than a
high-school education wanted or intended a(nother) child, with the percentage declining substantially at higher
levels of educational attainment. Only
23.8 per cent of college-educated
women wanted or intended a(nother)
child. Among religious groups, almost
70 per cent of Protestant women wanted
or intended to have children, compared
with 24.9 percent of Catholics, 2.3 per
cent of Jewish women and 3.2 per cent
of those who reported no religious affiliation.

Comparison of the characteristics of
women in the 1982 NSFG with those in
1973 and 1976 indicate that younger

Poston and Cullen

 

Social Biology

women, and those who have no biological children, are most favorable toward
adoption (in 1973 and 1976) or, in 1982,
want or intend children. What is important with respect to the 1982 data, is that
these women are, for the most part, unable to bear children of their own. AlIthough these women were not asked
about adoption plans, we believe that
the fact that substantial numbers of
them want or intend to have children
provides a good proxy measure for
adoption propensity. We now turn to
log-linear analyses of the characteristics
of women with a propensity to adopt.

Loc-LINEAR ANALYSES

Each of the characteristics described
in the previous section was first examined for its overall association with the
propensity to adopt (tables of associations of these characteristics with adoption propensity not shown, but available
from the authors). Of the various characteristics, age at interview and parity
have the highest chi-square values for
women in 1973, and for both groups of
women in the 1976 survey. Among the
women in 1982, age at interview, parity,
and fecundity status have the highest
chi-square values. As we have already
noted, these three characteristics are
also highly relevant with respect to actual adoption behavior (Poston and Cullen, 1986). Since fecundity status is such
an important determinant of actual
adoption behavior, and because of the
high association with adoption propensity in the 1982 data, we opted to include
it in our log-linear analysis for all three
survey years. The results of the loglinear analyses follow.

The best-fitting log-linear model for
each of the NSFG samples is one examining the effects on propensity of the

Vol. 36, No. 3-4

three variables of parity, fecundity status, and age at interview, as well as the
effects on propensity of two interaction
terms (parity with fecundity status, and
parity with age at interview). This model
accounted for 97.4 per cent of the baseline chi-square for “Group I’ women in
1973, and 92.3 per cent of the value for
them in 1976. This model accounts for
93.9 per cent of the base-line chi-square
value for “Group 2”” women in 1976;
and it accounts for 91.2 percent of the
variance in propensity for women in
1982 (tables of log-linear models not
shown, but available from the authors).

Tables 4, 5, and 6 present the expected odds-ratios for each category of
the three independent variables, as well
as for the categories of the interactions
between parity and fecundity status, and
between parity and age at interview. Table 4 contains the odds-ratios for those
women in 1973 and 1976 who would
have little difficulty in having a child of
their own (the “Group 1” women). Table 5 presents odds-ratios for those
women in 1976 for whom it would be difficult or impossible to have a child (the
“Group 2” women). And Table 6 shows
the odds-ratios for the proxy adoption
propensity variable for the groups of
women in 1982. Note also that the categories of fecundity status differ somewhat for each group. The first group of
women in 1976 contains subfecund,
long-interval, and fecund women, but in
1973, long-interval women were included in the subfecund category. Only
noncontraceptively sterile, subfecund,
and long-interval women in the second
group in 1976 were asked the question
on intention to adopt, thereby excluding
contraceptively sterile and fecund
women. In 1982, contraceptively and
noncontraceptively sterile women were
included, as were subfecund and long
Propensity to Adopt Children 177

interval women. Only the fecund

women were excluded in 1982.
Expected odds-ratios provide a pre
cise method of evaluating the greater or

lesser likelihood of adoption propensity

for women in a particular category of an
independent variable versus other categories. For a trichotomous dependent
variable such as propensity to adopt (response categories of “‘yes,” “maybe”
and “no” in the 1973 and 1976 surveys),
an expected odds-ratio provides the
odds of being in one category of the dependent variable, for contrasting categories of one or more independent variables. In the case of a dichotomous
dependent variable such as desire/intent
to have children (response categories of
“ves” and “‘no”’) asked of women in the
1982 survey, the expected odds-ratio
provides the odds of being in one or the
other category of the dependent variable.

Odds-ratios are computed following
the methodological procedures set out
by Daymont and Kaufman (1979). Tables 4, 5, and 6 present odds-ratios for
the groups of women in the 1973, 1976,
and 1982 NSFG’s, based on their respective tau parameters. Looking first at
the parity variable for the comparable
groups of women in 1973 and 1976 (Table 4), the odds-ratios for childless
women in the category “‘yes versus others” (Table 4, Row 1, Cols. 1 and 4) are
3.51 and 2.64, respectively. These values indicate that the odds of childless
women in both survey years are threeand-a-half (1976) and more than twoand-a-half (1973) times greater toward
favoring adoption as against not favoring adoption, compared to women in all
the other parity categories. A similar
pattern is found for the “Group 2”
women in 1976 (Table 5, Row 1, Col. 1).
In 1982 (Table 6), the odds of wanting or

intending to have a(nother) child are almost eight times greater for childless
women than for women with children.
In addition, women with one child in
1982 were more than two times more
likely to want children than women in

the other parity categories. In 1973 and
1976, the odds were less than one among
both “Group 1” and “Group 2” women
that women at higher parities would respond “yes” to the question regarding
the likelihood of adoption.

It is important to remember that the
odds-ratios discussed control for the direct effects on adoption propensity of fecundity status, of age at interview, and
of the interactions between parity and

fecundity status and between parity and
age. That is, the odds apply even after
considering the effects on adoption propensity of the other independent variables and the two interactions.

Analysis of the odds-ratios for the fecundity status variable in the 1973 and
1976 surveys indicates the generally
weaker influence of fecundity status on
adoption propensity. No clearly discernible pattern emerges, reflecting, in part,
differences in the criteria used to determine which groups of women were
asked about their attitudes toward
adoption, and the wording of the questions asked of these groups of women
(see our earlier discussion for a description of these criteria). Looking first at
those women who would have little or
no difficulty bearing children (Table 4),
subfecund women in 1973 were two
times more likely to have answered
“yes” rather than “maybe” or “no” to
the question on adoption propensity. In
1976, subfecund women were four-anda-half times more likely to have responded “yes.” These results are not
surprising, since by definition, these
women had already experienced difficulties in bearing children of their own.
When we turn to the results for the
“Group 2” women in 1976, which included the noncontraceptively sterile
category of fecundity status as well as
subfecund and long-interval women
(Table 5), the expected odds-ratios
reflect only a weak association between
fecundity status and adoption propensity. The odds of noncontraceptively
sterile women were only slightly more
than even to be most favorable toward
adoption (“‘yes’” versus all others) and
those of subfecund women less than
even. Moreover, subfecund women
were almost three-and-a-half times
more likely to have responded ‘“‘no” to
the question on adoption propensity.

Turning now to those women in the
1982 NSFG for whom we constructed
the proxy measure of adoption propensity (Table 6), we see that noncontra
Propensity to Adopt Children 181

ceptively sterile women are almost fourand-a-half times more likely to desire or
intend a child or children than are
women in the other categories of fecundity status. In fact, the odds of women in
these categories wanting or intending
children are less than one, indicating little influence of these other categories of
fecundity status on desire or intention to
have children. In contrast to our findings
regarding the effect of fecundity status
on adoption propensity for 1973 and
1976, the 1982 results show a much
stronger influence of fecundity status on
adoption propensity.

The direct effect of the third independent variable, age at interview, on adoption propensity reveals no consistent
pattern of influence among the groups
of women in the 1973 and 1976 surveys,
but in the 1982 survey, younger women
are clearly more favorable toward desiring or intending a(nother) child.

Turning now to the interactions, the
second panels of Tables 4, 5, and 6
present expected odds-ratios for the categories of the interaction of parity with
fecundity status for the first groups of
women in 1973 and 1976 (Table 4), the
second group in 1976 (Table 5), and
women in the 1982 survey (Table 6).

Looking first at the comparisons of
the first groups between 1973 and 1976,
the odds of women being at least somewhat favorable toward adoption tend to
decrease with increasing parity. When
examining categories of fecundity status
within levels of parity, however, no
clearly discernible pattern emerges. In
1976, childless long-interval women had
the highest odds of being most favorable, and childless subfecund women,
the highest odds of being somewhat favorable. In 1973, there are only slight
differences between subfecund and fecund women in the odds of being either

182

favorable or somewhat favorable toward adoption. Similar variations in the
odds of being favorable or not toward
adoption are apparent at higher levels of
parity, suggesting that within the parityfecundity interaction, there is a tendency for the odds-ratios to vary from
high to low more on the basis of the parity categories than on the basis of the fecundity categories. At least with respect
to this group of women, parity appears
to be a more influential predictor of propensity to adopt than fecundity status.
Similar results are found for those
women in 1976 who would find it difficult or impossible to have a(nother)
child (Table 5). In general, the odds favoring adoption decrease at higher levels of parity. The one exception to this
pattern occurs among two-parity, longinterval women (the second panel of Table 5, Row 9, Cols. 1 and 2), but this disparity is more likely to be a result of the
relatively small number of cases in these
categories than to any tendency for
longer-interval women at this parity
level to be more favorable toward adoption. When categories of fecundity status are examined within categories of
parity, childless noncontraceptively
sterile women and subfecund women
have the highest odds of being favorable
toward adoption than all other
women—5.56 and 5.71, respectively.
Parity one, noncontraceptively sterile
women are almost as likely to favor
adoption as to be negative toward it, and
in all fecundity status categories within
parity levels, the odds are substantially
less than one that these women are favorable toward adoption. Conversely,
the odds of women being negative toward adoption tend to increase with increased parity—women with three or
more children in the long-interval fecundity category are almost five times more

Poston and Cullen

likely not to consider adoption, and
long-interval women with one child almost eight times more likely to be negative toward adoption than all other
women. As is the case with women for
whom having a(nother) child would not
be difficult, parity rather than fecundity
status appears to be more influential in
determining adoption propensity.
When odds-ratios for the parityfecundity status interaction are examined for women in 1982 (Table 6, Panel
2), the overall pattern is similar to that
found in 1973 and 1976, that is, the odds
of women wanting a(nother) child tend
to decrease with increasing parity.
When odds-ratios for categories of fecundity status within levels of parity are
examined, there are differences. At
zero parity, it is subfecund and longinterval women who have the highest
odds-ratios favorable toward having
children (the size of the odds-ratios
reflects the relatively small number of
women in these categories). Among
women with one child, subfecund
women are nine times more likely to
want an additional child than women in
all other categories of fecundity status.
Women at parity levels of two and
higher, regardless of fecundity status,
are least likely to want more children, as
evidenced by odds-ratios of less than
one in all parity-fecundity status categories. Thus, we can conclude that parity is
the greater influence on adoption propensity in 1982, as it is in 1973 and 1976.
We turn now to an examination of
the parity-age interactions, i.e., the
third panel of Tables 4, 5, and 6. The expected odds-ratios of the interaction of
parity with age at interview in the 1982
data suggest a somewhat greater influence of age on intention to have children than in 1973 and 1976, although
parity also exerts a strong influence. The

odds of wanting a(nother) child decline
at successively higher parity levels, particularly among younger women. Thus,
while parity is clearly an important influence on the desire to have children,
age also appears to exert an effect. Unlike the results in 1973 and 1976, it is the
younger, childless and one-child women
in the 1982 survey who are more likely
to express the desire or intention to have
children. We believe that these results
lend strong support for the use of our
proxy measure of adoption propensity
since, for all these women, having a
child or additional children would be either difficult or impossible. We now turn
to a discussion of the implications of the
results.

CONCLUSIONS

The major finding of this study is that
parity appears to be the most important
determinant of the propensity to adopt,
although fecundity status and age also
have noteworthy effects. The differences in fecundity status between the
two groups of women interviewed in
1976 reflect differences in the categories
of fecundity status in each group. With
respect to comparisons between 1973
and 1976, the inclusion of long interval
women in the subfecund category may
have masked differences between these
two categories in 1973. Differences in
age—younger women being more favorable in one group and older women
more favorable in the second—may
refiect differences in the wording of the
questions on propensity to adopt or differences in age composition between the
two groups of women in 1976. Women
in the second group (those for whom
pregnancy is difficult or impossible)
were asked if they intended to adopt,
and among this group, older childless

 

Propensity to Adopt Children 183

women had the highest odds favoring
adoption. It is possible that these
women were more actively considering
adoption, since by definition most of
them would not expect to have children
of their own (more than 80 per cent of
these women were noncontraceptively
sterile). In contrast, of those women
who would have little or no difficulty
having biological children, 83 per cent
were fecund, and their response may
well reflect a more hypothetical positive
attitude toward adoption rather than a
specific intent to adopt.

The results of our analysis of the 1982
data are similar to the results using data
from the earlier surveys with respect to
parity, but vary somewhat for fecundity
status and age at interview. The women
in 1982 were most similar in composition
to the second group in 1976, because by
definition it would be difficult or impossible for them to have biological children. Unlike the women in 1976, however, contraceptively sterile women
were included in the 1982 group, and
since they comprised 62 per cent of the
total, may well have affected the results
of the analysis. Moreover, as we pointed
out in the introduction, the women in
1982 were not directly questioned about
adoption propensity, and we can only
speculate as to their attitudes toward
adoption as a strategy for having children.

What, then, are the implications of
this analysis on the potential demand for
adoption? That is, can we assume that a
favorable attitude toward adoption will
trarislate into actual behavior? Based on
the results of our study, it seems clear
that childless, noncontraceptively sterile, subfecund (and perhaps longinterval) women would be those most
likely to consider adoption, just as
women with these same characteristics

184

are most likely to have actually adopted.
The greater likelihood for younger
women in the 1982 data set to want children, keeping in mind that they would
find it difficult or impossible to have children of their own, suggests that age may
be less of a factor now than it was in the
1970’s. To the extent that our proxy
measure of adoption propensity in 1982
captures a potentially adoptive population, younger women may make up a
larger proportion of those seeking to
adopt in the 1980’s.

Unfortunately, we can only speculate
as to whether or not those women who
indicated a propensity to adopt will try
(or have already tried) to adopt a child.
Just as we have no firm estimates of the
number of babies available for adoption, we have no firm estimate for 1982
of the number of women who report a
propensity to adopt. But given the fact
that, in general, women who are childless, especially those who are childless
because of involuntary sterility or subfecundity, tend to show a high propensity

to adopt, our results are at least suggestive of a high demand for adoption relative to a small supply. Two factors lead
us to suspect that demand may be fairly
high relative to the actual numbers of
babies available to adopt. One is the increasing trends of involuntary childlessness and subfecundity (Bachrach,
1983a), and the second is the declining
number of babies available for adoption
(Bachrach, 1985).

One additional point needs to be
made. The 1982 NSFG did not ask a
question on propensity to adopt, but did
ask, for each adopted child, whether or
not the child had been born outside the
United States. Slightly more than 10 per
cent of all reported adoptions were of
foreign-born children (Bachrach, 1985).
All of these factors are merely suggestive. However, they do point toward a
greater demand for adoption, and to an
increased demand in the future, that is,
to the extent that present trends of increased childlessness persist.
