PTC Tasting in Two Social Groups

The purpose of this brief note is to add
support to the view that cultural factors,
such as racial and social discrimination, can
affect the genetic composition of human
groups by selective membership criteria.

A sample of University of California introductory physical anthropology students
was tested some time ago on a volunteer
basis for their ability to taste PTC (phenylthiocarbamide) by the 5% paper-impregnation technique. Students in these large introductory classes are from nearly every de

partment, and the sample can be viewed as
effectively random for this student population. All geographical and many local races
are represented on campus and in these
courses, although the majority in both instances are Caucasian (white). At the same
time the above sample was obtained, members of a Greek-letter social fraternity and a
sorority were tested by the same method.
This group is largely white American.

The results of the two sets of tests are
shown in Table 1. What is obvious by simple
inspection is that the two samples (random
and fraternity) are different in their fre
quency of non-taster/taster phenotype ratios. A chi-square test shows that the difference is statistically significant (x? = 4.88; P
is between 0.05 and 0.01). There is little dif-.
ference between the male fraternity nontaster frequency (38.7%) and that of the
female sorority (37.2%), so the difference in
Table 1 cannot be attributed solely to sex
influence on the PTC polymorphism.

The fraternity sample is significantly different from that of the random sample
largely because of de facto and/or overt racial discrimination, which at the time these
data were collected was a major campus
issue. The PTC nontaster phenotype frequency of the fraternity group is more like
that of Europeans (c. 25 to 45%) and American whites (c. 30 to 35%) than like that of
American Negroes (9 to 23%), African Negroes (c. 6%), Mongoloids (7 to 10%), or
American Indians (<3%) according to
Montagu (1960, p. 222). Further, these PTC
data suggest that the genetic effects of social selection may be more pervasive than
commonly supposed, making the evaluation
of natural selection on human variation all
the more difficult.
