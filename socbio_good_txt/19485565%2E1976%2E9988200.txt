Reservation Population

ABSTRACT: Methods derived from stable population theory are employed to estimate the effect
emigration is exerting upon the capacity of a Southwest Indian reservation population to
develop economically. This capacity is measured by age-structure-dependent demographic
indices which have been shown to affect the availability of development funds. Emigration is
found to be absorbing all of the current positive growth of the population, decreasing and aging
the available labor force and increasing the dependency burden upon nondependent members
of the population. It is concluded that emigration affects the population structure in a way
that could hinder economic development of the reservation population.

The capacity of a population to evolve
economically or otherwise is not independent of its demographic structure. The
available labor force, the dependency burden imposed by the very young and the
very old, and the rates of reproduction and
population growth and emigration all condition structural changes of economic, political, and social institutions to accommodate the changing population structure
(Retherford, 1972). Demographic change
and response can affect the nature and extent of social controls on individual behavior (Hardin, 1968), mate selection patterns
(Matsunaga, 1966; Rele, 1965), land use
and technological change (Boserup, 1965),
ritual and political roles (Netting, 1972;
Dumond, 1972), and social organization
(Lee, 1972; Davis and Combs, 1949). Ordinarily, demographic changes responsible
for structural changes of these kinds ultimately result from changes in values which
are rooted in economic conditions of exis
21

tence and the social status which these conditions bestow on the individual (Davis,
1963).

The most dramatic recent demographic
change has been the rapid decline in death
rates in less developed countries causing
rapid population growth (Davis, 1956).
While this change was externally induced
by Western medical and health administration, new values favoring lower fertility
have emerged in some non-Western societies in response to new economic conditions imposed by rapid growth and the
social and economic structures of urban
centers (Kirk, 1971). For other societies,
unfavorable demographic conditions and
the time lag required for value reorientation may already have obviated this demographic response because the degree of economic development required to provide the
economic incentives for lower family size
is itself hindered by rapid growth (Davis,
1963).

When reproduction greatly exceeds mortality, maximum growth and greater youth
dependency require heavy public service
outlays, so-called “demographic investments,” which divert funds from net investment and economic development programs (Coale and Hoover, 1958). Populations with higher growth rates require
proportionally greater investments of national income to produce a given level of
increase in per capita income and hence,
under certain conditions, also in savings,
reinvestment, productivity, and development.? Although the youthful and expanding labor force of rapidly growing populations is often receptive to new value orientations conducive to rapid social structural,
political, and economic changes which better facilitate modernization (Davis and
Combs, 1949), it may be unable to effect
these changes because of lack of funds.

On the other hand, when reproduction
and growth are low, elders form a larger
portion of both the dependent population
and the labor force. As such a population
ages, it may become tradition-bound and
less receptive to value reorientations associated with modernization (Kuznets, 1960).
France is often cited as a case in point
(Davis and Combs, 1949). However, since
persons aged sixty-five and older form a
minority in all populations, the greater oldage dependency may require less demographic investment. In addition, although
the labor force is smaller, the slower
growth and the low youth dependency
release demographic investments, thus improving productive capabilities.

While the rapidly growing young population may be more receptive to change, it
may lack funds to initiate change. The slow
growing older population may have the
necessary funds, but may resist change by

the strengthening of the existing traditional
institutions. Both conditions constitute two
different types of demographic constraint
upon economic modernization.

Emigration and immigration are forces
which can either augment or diminish the
advantages of both demographic regimes.
Since migration typically involves younger
individuals, the effect of emigration in the
community of origin should be to age the
residual population (Valores, 1949), unless
reciprocal immigration occurs. If young
members of the labor force emigrate from
a population showing rapid growth, high
dependency might continue and indeed increase through time as the labor force
grows smaller and old-age dependency increases. The advantages of a youthful progressive labor force could be lost as the
labor force ages and the remaining nonmigrant population increasingly represents
a residual traditional population. Such a
population, then, will be subject to both
forms of constraint opposing modernization.

The Sells Reservation Papago of southern Arizona, a residual tradition-bound
population whose natural rate of population increase (birth minus deaths) is high,
might represent such a population. Young
upwardly mobile Papago acquire tastes for
modern conveniences which can only be acquired either off the reservation or with
wages supplied by wage-labor jobs which
are not available on the Sells Reservation
(Hackenberg, 1972). Since at least the
turn of the century, a progressively deteriorating land base (Schulman, 1956;
Glendening, 1952) has provided an additional incentive for emigration to achieve
economic success. Analysis of a sample of
emigrants from a restricted area of the
Sells Reservation indicated that the average emigrant today leaves prior to marriage, slightly below the age of twenty
(Hackenberg and Wilson, 1972).

The purpose of this study is to estimate

the effects of emigration upon the demographic constraints on economic modernization of the Sells Papago population by
posing the following questions: (1) Has
emigration alone increased the dependency
load upon the adult labor force? (2) Has
emigration diminished and aged the available labor force? (3) Has emigration altered the replacement capacity of the population? Further, since the data required
to answer these and other questions using
formal demographic techniques are usually
unavailable for folk societies (Petersen,
1975), we shall determine whether answers
to these questions can be obtained through
an ordinary census of the population. It is
from the analysis of the census population
alone that the anthropologist must ordinarily draw inferences regarding the significance of demographic indicators as
cause or effect.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Our sample for analysis consists of all
Papago living on the Sells Indian Reservation at the end of the year 1959 (slightly
over 4,000 individuals) and all births and
deaths occurring between the years 1955
and 1959. These data are contained within
the Papago population register, based on
the genealogical reconstruction of an ancestral population of 1875 together with all
descendents to 1960 (Hackenberg, 1967).
We have used vital events occurring within
the five years prior to the benchmark date
of 1960 because precise dates of birth and
death, which are required for determining
vital rates, are often unavailable or unreliable at earlier dates. The register records
all founders of 1875 and their descendents
who were born on the Sells Reservation but
emigrated, and all who ever immigrated
onto the reservation from off-reservation
locations, but it does not indicate the age
at or date of migration.

Our method is to construct a partial
synthetic (cohort) abridged life table
(using ten-year age groups) under observed conditions of emigration and immigration and another under the hypothetical
condition excluding migration. Finally, such
a life table will be constructed using census
data alone, and intrinsic rates of birth and
growth and the stable population age structures (female dominant) they determine
compared with those of that table under
observed conditions of migration.

If the census is a reliable indicator of the
demographic characteristics of the population (i.e., if no recent changes in fertility
and mortality have occurred), the two
stable age structures should agree closely
since both reflect the effects of migration.
When either of these stable structures is
compared with the stable structure ignoring the effects of migration, the effects that
migration is exerting upon the age structure of the population can be inferred.
Given relatively constant death (14,) and
birth (6,) rates (the vital rates) over a
period of time, a population approaches its
stable form unless otherwise perturbed.

Once stable, the population either remains stationary or increases or decreases
at a constant rate. Even when perturbed,
it returns to relative stability within two
or three generations (Coale, 1972). Since
the rate of growth, 7, can never differ
greatly from zero (otherwise the population would rapidly either exceed the maximum which resources can support or would
become extinct), the vital rates, barring
external perturbations, can indeed change
only slowly, if at all. As a result, a population will never stray far from the unique
age structure intrinsic to these current vital
rates upon which the age structure totally
depends (excepting migration). If the population is unstable, as all probably are, the
stable age structure, in the absence of any
marked perturbations in recent decades,

24.

can indicate the direction toward which the
observed age structure is changing.

While there is some evidence that mortality declined from just over 30 per thousand
in 1940 (Jones, 1953; Joseph et al., 1949)
to about 15 per thousand in 1960 (Smith,
1973), the earlier death rates were estimated for only small selected areas of the
reservation, some of which contained migrant labor camps where infectious diseases
were endemic due to poor living conditions.
Mortality declines since 1940, for the population as a whole, were probably less dramatic than the earlier mortality estimates
would indicate. Even were they not, mortality declines, unlike changes in fertility,
affect the entire age distribution (albeit,
not equally at all age levels) and hence
only minimally affect its overall stability.
While fertility changes usually have pronounced effects upon stability (since the
entire effect is exerted upon the 0-1 age
group), fertility of the Sells Reservation
Papago has not changed since at least the
turn of the century (Uhlman, 1972). Recent changes in vital rates are unlikely,
then, to have appreciably affected either
the approach of the population toward stability or the nature of the stable age structure intrinsic to vital rates prevailing between 1955 and 1959. Further, our analysis
will develop so as either to remain unaffected by recent changes in vital rates or
to provide means to detect such effects.

The effect of emigration can be included
in life tables by treating each emigrant (or
each member lost through the combined
forces of emigration and immigration) as
a death (Cox, 1970). A comparison of the
stable distribution under current birth,
death, and migration rates with that distribution intrinsic only to the observed death
and birth rates, ignoring migration, will
indicate the effect which migration is exerting on the population.

deaths to those aged x to x + 10 between
1955 and 1959 and 49P, is the total population aged x to x + 10 at midpoint of the
time interval during which the deaths occurred (the midterm population). These
and other rates were calculated for tenyear age groups since this is often the most
reliable census grouping to which the anthropologist can aspire. The probability of
not surviving from exact age x to exact
age x -+ 10, 10g, can easily be shown to be

(Barclay, 1958), if deaths are equally
spaced throughout the time interval 1955~

from age x to age x + 10, is 1 — 10gz. Agespecific fertility rates are: 400, = 210B:/
10F’, where 3 0B, is the number of births
between 1955 and 1959 to mothers aged x
tox -+ 10 and ,P,—‘ is the midterm female
population aged x to x +- 10. Of the hypothetical population, 7) in number, which
experiences the observed vital rates of each
group as it moves through the age distribution, the number of each age group
which survives to exact age x -+ 10 is given
by lz+10 == Pele where I, the radix, is arbitrarily set at 100 (i.e., everyone ever
born survives to exact age zero). The fraction of a person-year lived by an average
individual during the average year is approximated as J, =I, + le410/2lo. Using
only census data, /, can be determined as
follows: 10fc, the probability of surviving
from exact age x to exact age x-+ 10, is
set equal to 19P2410/10P2 Which represents
the ratio of the numbers of individuals in
the observed census population in two adjacent age groups (Stolnitz, 1956). A conDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

venient radix is assigned and 11) = lp(10f0).
More generally, Ip439 =le(10P2) and l, =
L, + 1p439/2lo as before.

The stable age distribution determined
by the observed vital rates is given by
e(x) = e-"l,. We have followed Keyfitz
and Flieger (1971) in constructing this
distribution, the statistical expression for
which was elaborated by Bourgeois-Pichat
(1968). If rates of birth (&) and population increase (rv) do not change, and the
number of births in some benchmark year
is B, the births during the next year will
be e’B. The total population after 100
years can be written as: P= Bhoo +
Be'lyg +- Be*"Igg +... + Be!°, where the
four terms give the number of individuals
in the stable population aged, respectively,
100, 99, 98, and 0 (below I year of age).
This equation reduces into c(x) = be~"l,
where c(x) is the proportion in each age
group x to x-+ 10 and # is the mid-point
of the age group (i.e., 5, 15, 25,... 75).

The value of r is determined by equating
it with In Ro/(Ri/Ro — r’o7/2) where

Ro = X1,b,, R, = S4,band

> (2 i)
o* = Ro

A trial value is set for 7 to estimate r.
The latter is then set equal to ” and the
procedure reiterated until r and 7’ converge. The intrinsic birth rate, b, can be
estimated as 1/Se—"l,. The value of r is
then substituted in the term c(x) = e-"7l,
for each age group and the proportion of
each age group in the stable population is
c(x)/Xc(x). A comparison of the stable
and observed populations indicates the relative stability of the observed population.
An index of dissimilarity (ID) between
any two age structures can be calculated
by summing the absolute percentage points
over all age groups by which the two age

structures differ. By comparison, the ID
for the comparison of the observed and
stable populations for England and Wales
in 1881 was 1.4 (the lowest ID known for
any population), 6.2 for the United States
in 1967, 26.3 for Japan in 1966 (Keyfitz
and Flieger, 1971), and 10 and 13 for male
and female Yanomama Indians in Brazil
(Neel and Weiss, 1975).

The adequacy of the life table derived
from census data is itself a function of the
stability of the age structure of the population. To determine the stable structure
of the census population, the proportion of
the total population represented by each age
group, ¢(x), is first calculated. C(x), then,
is equivalent to be—"(*+5)/, where 6 and r
are the intrinsic rates of birth and growth
(i.e., the rates observed for the stable population having the same vital rates as the
census population) and x-+ 5 is the median age of the age interval. Rearranging
terms, the log transformation of c(x)/l, =
be-"(@+5) is In ce/ly = Inb — r(x +5) =
In 6 — 5r+ (—r)x. This last expression
should be recognized as an equation of the
linear form y == mx +- 6’ where in c(x) /I,
is y, y (the slope of the regression line) is
m, x is the beginning year of the age interval (0, 10, 20,... , 80) and the expression
l, b- 57, the » intercept of the regression
line, corresponds to 0’. If ln b —5r= 0’,
then Inb = b’ +- 5r and 6 = e® +5", which
is computed once the slope is known. Substituting b and r into y0¢z = i10/zbe-™ and
dividing 39°%x by 2X 40¢, gives the stable age
proportions.

Since this technique requires that the
census numbers in each ascending age
group progressively decline, so that 30Pz is
always less than 1.0, it is often necessary
to smooth the age distribution. Used with
discretion, smoothing does not affect the
general shape of the age pyramid and is
especially justified when errors in aging the
population are likely to be responsible for

26

marked differences in the numbers in adjacent age groups. Adjustments can be
made by simply summing the P, which is
out of sequence with that preceding and
that following it (i.e., Pr-190 + Pe + Pei10)
and assigning to P, the new value obtained
by dividing that sum by three (Benjamin
and Haycocks, 1970). The excess or shortage of the adjusted over the actual population of this age group is then equally divided between the preceding and following
age groups.

The stable age distribution under emigration is derived from the life table constructed with g, values which include agespecific frequencies of net migration loss
(emigration — immigration). Since neither
age at nor year of emigration is known,
age-specific migration rates were estimated
by assuming that the proportion lost to net
migration and the age distribution of these
has not changed in recent decades. Since
emigration to locations where wage-labor
jobs are available has been an economic
alternative exercised by Papago since at
least as early as the seventeenth century
(Hackenberg, 1964), the proportion of
Sells Papago who emigrate could not have
changed greatly during this century. Since
immigration rates are less than one-tenth
of those for emigration, even substantial
changes in numbers of immigrants or their
age distributions will have little effect upon
age-specific migration loss. Since the turn
of the century, immigration rates have,
on the average, been below one immigrant
per thousand population per year, and
emigration rates have been roughly ten to
fifteen emigrants per thousand population
per year (Smith, 1973).

The total population at risk of ever emigrating was determined by reverse-surviving the entire population alive at the end
of 1959 through all age groups through
which each individual would have passed,
given complete survival. This task required

Smith

calculating rates of survival (s,) from each
successive age group to the next by s9 =
slo/lo and Sz = y0l2+10/1olz. Since the midterm population at risk, used to arrive at
gz and /,, is affected by age-specific net
migration loss, which is yet unknown, it is
necessary to obtain a first approximation
of M, as (10D2)/(10P2) and Ie410 aS Pale.
This calculation assumes only that mortality has not changed since the time that
individuals of that age where emigration
is completed were born. Since all emigration was found to be effectively completed
by age 30, we must then assume that mortality has been relatively stable only since
1930.

The resulting hypothetical nonmigrant
population that would have been observed
at the end of 1959 under complete survival,
P., can be approximated by:

n—1
P, = P| 1/s;

i=1

where IT is the sum product, 7 denotes each
ten-year age group through which the individual would have passed during his life to
1959, is the age group in which he would
now fall whether or not he lived, and 5; is
the survival function for the 7th age group,
where each of the age groups is numbered
sequentially beginning with the number 1
for the age group 0-4.

Each age group of the total hypothetical
1959 population under complete survival
was then augmented by the number who
would have fallen in that age group of the
reservation population had they not emigrated (less those who immigrated) and
this total (which we will call the potential
population) becomes the denominator for
the proportion of those at risk who ever
emigrated. Since, for example, 0.1497 of
the potential 1959 population aged 0-4 was
lost to net migration, the proportion of the
population lost to net migration, gem, before

Vol. 23, No. 1 Effect of Emigration on an Indian Population

reaching exact age 5 is taken to be 0.1497.
Since 0.1498 of the potential population
aged 5—9 was ever lost to net migration,
0.1498-0.1497 or 0.0001 is taken as the
proportion lost between ages 5 and 9.
This procedure was first conducted upon
five-year age groups, since the ten-year age
groups 0-9 and 20-29 were each found to
combine two five-year age groups which
would have differed considerably in their
emigration rates. The method was continued through successive age groups until
the ratio of the number ever lost to the
potential 1959 population failed to increase,
indicating the cessation of net migration
loss. The fact that loss is heavy for the
first five-year age group and almost nil for
the second, implies that these emigrants are
offspring of young adults who probably
leave in their early twenties (i.e., an age
where few parents have offspring whose age
is greater than five years). The fact that
the figures for dem for the three five-year
age groups spanning ages 15 through 29
are, respectively, 0.027, 0.195 and 0.006
supports the premise that adult emigration
effectively ends by about age 25. The gem
proportions were then collapsed into tenyear age groups and were, respectively,
0.1498, 0.0891, and 0.1973 for the first
three age groups and 0.0000 for all others.
Only changes in vital rates and their
distribution occurring since 1930 can affect
the accuracy of our methods. If mortality
has declined since 1930, emigration rates
for age groups beyond age ten would be
overestimated. But if emigration has increased since 1930, these rates would be
underestimates. We have argued that

changes of such recency will be both minimal and offsetting, such that our estimates
of age-specific emigration rates cannot be
too far off.

To obtain the midterm population with
which to calculate corrected J, values, the
1955 population was estimated by:

27

5P,}955 — 5Pp 45199 + 5Dz
+ (Gem 5P’x'**)

where 5D, is the number of deaths occurring between 1955 and 1959 to those aged
x to x + 5. An arbitrary value is first assumed for 5P’,!% 5 to obtain ;P,19** and the
estimation reiterated, setting the acquired
5,195 value to 5P’,)°5 until sP’,)9 and
5P,1°°> converge to give the true estimate
of ;P,1955, The midterm population is then
obtained as 5P, = 5P,19 4+ 5P,19°9/2 and
the corrected 6, and M, values calculated
using ;P, as the new denominator.

To construct the stable population without emigration, the g- values were used to
obtain 7, in the manner previously described. To construct the stable population
under emigration, gq’; values were used to
arrive at 1, where g’s = G2 + Gem. The two
stable structures were then compared, an
ID calculated, and various age-structuredependent demographic indices that affect
the adaptive capacities of economic structures computed for comparison.

Finally, the stable census population was
constructed, and the statistical significance
of the linear regression used to estimate 7
and & was determined using the variance
ratio (F), the regression sum of squares to
the mean of the within sum of squares. The
derived age structure was next compared
with the stable population without emigration to again estimate the effects of emigration upon the age structure. The results
obtained from the stable forms of the census and observed populations were then
compared for consistency.

Since any changes in vital rates will affect
the two stable age structures constructed
from vital registration data equally, such
inferences derived from the comparison of
these two structures will be valid even
under conditions of recent demographic
change. While a decline in mortality can
affect the comparison of the stable popula

tion ignoring migration with that constructed from the census population alone,
we can detect such an effect by contrasting
the comparisons of the stable structure including migration with both that structure
ignoring migration and that structure constructed from the census data alone. If the
variation of the two stable age structures
which reflect the effects of migration from
the observed age structure are in the same
direction and if the variation of these two
structures from that excluding the effects
of migration are also in the same direction,
then recent changes in mortality and emigration can be assumed not to have influenced inferences drawn from census data
alone regarding the effects of emigration
upon the direction of demographic change.

ID of 7.46, showing reasonably close concordance.

The stable population under emigration
contained an excess of individuals over age
60 and too few under age 10 when compared with the stable structure of the census
population. Since adjusted P, values were
required only for ages 30 through 60, our
smoothing of the census population cannot
have significantly affected the stable age
distributions. A slight trend since 1930
either toward emigrating at younger ages
and before marriage or toward emigrating
at later ages with nuclear family units containing young offspring could be partially
responsible. The age distribution of gem
values would seem to support the latter
explanation, since the great majority of

when individual emigration seems unlikely.

The principal cause of the difference in
the two stable forms, however, is probably
an initial decline in mortality in the early
part of this century causing underestimates

of the decline in person-years-lived with
advancing age in the census population.
While /, values for age groups below age 50
are similar in both stable structures, for the
last three age groups of the stable census
population they are overestimated, with respect to the stable population based on current vital rates, by 20, 31, and 43 per cent,
respectively. Since this finding implies that
the major decline in mortality occurred
near the turn of the century, our assumption of relatively constant mortality since
at least 1930 would appear justified.

The ID comparison of the observed and
stable census populations, 9.0, reveals that
departure from stability results from an
excess of those under age 20 and too few
members over age 30. As the observed
population approaches stability, its proportions of youths will decline and those of
members over age 30 will increase. As a
greater and greater proportion of the population becomes exposed at all ages to those
vital rates currently prevailing at each age
group, the stable census population will
change in the direction of the stable population under emigration (as it loses young
members and more elders survive).

Since that direction is identical to the
one in which the observed census population is now changing, it seems clear that
while the age-specific vital rates we have
calculated for younger age groups may not
have applied to older members of the population alive in 1959, this lack of perfect
stability does not obscure the inferences we
can draw from comparing the stable with
the observed populations. The observed
population, when compared with both the
census and the stable population, under
current vital rates is changing in the direction of fewer members under age 20 and
more members over age 30. The intrinsic
rates of population increase (rv) and birth
(6), which should be observed when the
population reaches stability, for these two

 

29

stable structures also agree closely; r is
—0.0021 and —0.0053 for the stable populations under emigration and for the census
population, respectively, and b, 0.0257 and
0.0262. If current vital rates continue, the
population, when stability is reached, will
begin to decline at a low constant rate.

tion to ID for both the stable register (including migration) and the stable census
populations compared to the stable population ignoring migration. The minus and
plus signs indicate that the effects of emigration upon the age structure are, respectively, to diminish and increase numbers in
that age group. Results of the register data
show that emigration is proportionally diminishing the population under age 40 and
increasing that over age 40. Excepting the
0-9 age category, the same results obtain
from the census data. The most striking
similarity between the two data sets is the
effect of emigration in diminishing the proportion of young members of the labor force
(aged 20-39) while increasing that of older
members (aged 40-60).

for the observed population, for the stable
population both excluding and including
migration, and for the census population.
The approach to stability is increasing the
proportion of Papago in the youthful labor
force (ages 20-29), but most of the increase will be absorbed by current emigration rates. While the older component of
the labor force would decline slightly without emigration, emigration would increase
their proportion in the stable population by
almost 2 per cent. The proportion of the
population in the total labor force would
increase, but emigration will counteract
this trend.

While without emigration the proportion
over age 70 would decline, emigration will
increase this proportion. The dependency
ratio, the ratio of those aged under 10 and
over 70 to the remaining population (defined in this manner for convenience of
ten-year age groups) should decline as stability is approached; but emigration will
minimize this decline by increasing the
representation in the population of those
over age 70 and by retarding the growth
of the total labor force.

Emigration has little effect upon the
youth component of dependency which will
decline with or without emigration, and the
effect of emigration upon the birth rate is
also minimal. While the birth rate should
decline somewhat as stability approaches,
emigration will decrease the birth rate only
slightly more than would occur in its absence. The greatest effect of emigration will
be upon the growth rate. The current
annual growth rate of almost 1.5 per cent
should, regardless of emigration, decline at
least to just over 1 per cent, where it would
stabilize if vital rates did not change. If
current emigration and other vital rates
continue, however, the growth rate will
continue to decline, until, at stability, the
population is declining at a constant rate
of somewhat less than 0.5 per cent per year.

CONCLUSION

Overall, the effect of a net migration loss
of 13-16 per 1,000 per year is to decrease
the natural rate of population increase and
youthfulness of the population. With or
without emigration, dependency would decline, and the proportions in the young and

the total labor force would increase. However, emigration minimizes both of the
above, by increasing the proportion of
population over age 70 and decreasing the
proportion aged 20-39.

If development potential is viewed in
terms of available capital outlays which
are proportional to the size of the labor
force, progressive mindedness of a youthful
labor force, and minimization of demographic investments, the effect of emigration upon the Sells Papago will be to hinder
economic development of the residual reservation population.

With structural instability yielding an
ID as high as 9.0, the census data alone
led to conclusions which differed only in
magnitude, not in direction, from those
obtained with the register data. Both cases
indicate that the advantage of a youthful
labor force which results from rapid population growth is counteracted by heavy

31

emigration of the young members of the
population.

Answers to questions posed in this study
appear to be relatively insensitive to errors
caused by lack of perfect structural stability in the Sells Papago population. Since
the ideal of the stable population is seldom
if ever observed in the real world, and the
census is often the only demographic data
accessible to the anthropologist, it will be
paramount to identify other types of questions whose answers can be usefully approached through stable population theory
under various conditions of approximate
stability.
