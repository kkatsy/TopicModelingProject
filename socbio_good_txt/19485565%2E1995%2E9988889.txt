-. ABSTRACT: We used NCHS natality and linked-birth/death certificate tapes to compare
-© birthweight-specific neonatal and postneonatal mortality risks for Native Americans and whites
in 1960 and in 1984. The birthweight distributions for the two groups were similar both years.
© Native American neonatal mortality risk dropped from 20.2 in 1960 to 5.2 in 1984, and the
relative risk for Native Americans with respect to whites fell from 1.31 in 1960 to a nonsignificant
© difference in 1984, Postneonatal mortality risks for Native Americans fell from 27.5 in 1960 to
© 6.2 in 1984, with a drop in the relative risk from 5.2 to 2.1. Although the relative improvements
co for Native Americans were highest in postneonatal survival, Native Americans still had over
"_ twice the level of white postneonatal mortality. Birthweight was positively associated with
__survival for both groups, but the odds of Native American neonatal death were affected less by
& low and very low birthweights. For both groups, improvements in neonatal mortality were
-rhighest at the lower birthweights, while the gains in postneonatal survival benefitted normal and
.Y high birthweight infants most.

explanatory variables to these three
factors to provide a parsimonious interpretation of infant mortality trends
for these two populations and to highlight the interrelations among the three
explanatory factors.

Another advantage of this paper is
the utilization of linked national birth
and death certificate information to
provide an aggregate view of infant
survival for these two races. Other research has focused on subgroups of Native Americans, especially those living
in IHS service areas or states with high
concentrations of Native Americans.
We examine the 1960 and 1984 cohorts
because of the remarkable improvement in infant survival during this period and the availability of linked birth/
death datasets.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for this study come from
national linked birth/death certificate
registries provided by the National
Center for Health Statistics. The 1960
natality tape includes 98.9 per cent of
births occurring in the United States
and 96.4 per cent of births in the
“other’’ race category (National Center for Health Statistics, 1962). The
1984 natality tape includes 99.3 per
cent of births occurring in the United
States and 98.6 per cent of births in
the ‘“‘other” race category (National
Center for Health Statistics, 1988). Of
deaths to the 1960 cohort, 97.4 per
cent were successfully linked to the
corresponding birth certificate (National Center for Health Statistics,
1970), and 97.8 per cent of the deaths
to the 1984 cohort were successfully
linked to their corresponding birth certificates (Becerra et al., 1991).

Social Biology

Race identification is extracted from
the birth certificate information. A
higher likelihood of identifying a child
as Native American in 1984 is apparent, as there were nearly twice as many
Native American births in 1984 as in
1960.2 While general IHS benefits to
Native Americans have not improved
over the study period, the increasing
tendency to identify one’s infant as Native American may be due in part to
harsh economic conditions in many
states with large numbers of Native
Americans during the early 1980’s and
to the fact that Native Americans can
receive free medical care at IHS hospitals (IHS, personal communication,
10-23-90). Also, there were differences
in the procedures used for the two cohorts to assign race for cases when racial background was unknown for both
parents, probably resulting in a slightly
greater number of Native American
births classified in 1984 than in 1960
(National Center for Health Statistics,
1960; National Center for Health Statistics, 1988).

The net effect of this changing likelihood of Native American identification on the study results is unclear. If
relatively advantaged individuals are
more likely to be identified as Native
Americans in 1984 than in 1960, the actual improvements for Native Ameri
'The 1960 data provide more detailed breakdowns of Native Americans than do the 1984 data:
We consider infants born in 1960 and coded as Indian, Aleut, and Eskimo to be Native American.
Snipp (1986) advocates combining race and ancestry
information to identify Native Americans, but our
data only include information on race.

?The increase in reported Native American
births was not the result of increased fertility. Native
American crude birth rates were 33 per cent lower
in 1984 than they were in 1960 (IHS, 1989). Eschbach (1993) uses census data to show that the extent
of this higher propensity to identify oneself as Native American varies by region.

cans over the time period are probably
overstated. On the other hand, if less
advantaged individuals are more likely
to be classified as Native Americans in
1984 than in 1960, the improvement
would be understated. _

excluded from the analysis. This includes 3 per cent of the Native Americans born in 1960 and 0.2 per cent in

very poor fit. Adding the factors birthweight, cohort, and race in a stepwise
fashion gives a significant reduction in
the deviance at each stage, resulting in
an additive model with significant effects of all three factors and a deviance
of 495 with 10 degrees of freedom,
which is still a poor fit. Adding a
birthweight x cohort interaction gives
a significant reduction in the deviance,
indicating that the effect of birthweight
on survival is different for each cohort,
as expected. The same is true for the
birthweight X race and cohort xX race
interactions. The extent to which birthweight affects survival differs for the
two races, and the extent to which race
affects survival depends upon the year
of birth. Furthermore, this model with
all three main effects and all three twoway interactions fits the data, with a
deviance of 4.1 on 3 degrees of freedom. The parameter estimates for this
model are displayed in Table 1.
Taking antilogs of the statistically
significant parameter estimates gives
the effect of each factor category on
the odds of neonatal death with respect
to the reference group: white children
of normal birthweight born in 1960.
Native American infants in this same
birthweight-cohort category have 81
per cent higher odds of neonatal death.
In 1960 high birthweight whites
experience only 83 per cent of the
odds of neonatal death the reference
group faces.4 However, low birthweight whites experience over 17 times
the odds of neonatal death as the

‘The high birthweight x race term is insignificant, indicating that the effect of high birthweight
on Native American neonatal survival is about the
same as the effect of high birthweight on white neonatal survival. The high birthweight x cohort term
is also insignificant, indicating that the effect of high
birthweight is similar for the two cohorts.

reference group. This odds ratio for
low birthweight Native Americans
(with respect to normal birthweight
Native Americans) is attenuated somewhat, but is still quite high at 10.6.5

The disadvantage of low birthweight for neonatal survival was somewhat less in 1984 than in 1960.

510.6 is obtained by multiplying (17.4 x 0.61).
17.4 is the main effect of low birthweight and has as
its comparison group normal birthweight white infants born in 1960 (Table 1). The low birthweight x
Native American race interaction term is significant
(e® = 0.61), indicating that low birthweight affects
Native Americans differently (i.e., to a lesser extent) than whites.

The improvement in survival
chances for very low birthweight infants over the 24-year period was even
more dramatic. The odds of neonatal
death for these infants fell much more
than they did for other birthweight categories (e8 = 0.58). Again, the general
disadvantage for Native American survival is not nearly as severe at the very
low birthweight level compared to normal and high birthweight infants.

The parameter estimate for the cohort X race interaction indicates that
while normal-birthweight whites born
in 1984 experience only 30 per cent
 

Vol. 42, No. 1-2

of the odds of neonatal death of the
reference group, the improvement for
Native Americans was even more striking. Native American infants of normal
birthweight born in 1984 experienced
only 20 per cent of the odds of neonatal
death of their normal birthweight
counterparts born in 1960. In fact, Table 2, which presents neonatal mortality risks stratified by race and birth—weight, shows that while the overall
“risk of neonatal death was higher for
Native Americans than for whites in
—1960 (20.2 versus 15.3, RR = 1.3), and
substantially higher in the normal and
ohigh birthweight categories (RR = 1.8
cand RR = 2.53), there was no signifi=cant difference in the risk of overall
‘neonatal death between Native Amer—icans and whites by 1984 (5.2 versus
S»-0) or in any birthweight category.®

puischepancies in survival probabilities.

‘Our measures of infant mortality in 1984 are
higher than those reported by the Indian Health
Service (1989) but there are important differences
between these two studies. The IHS limits their 1984
estimates to Native Americans living in thirty-two
“reservation states.” Our data include births from
all states, but are limited to singleton births. Finally,
our measures come from linked birth/death certificates, while the IHS computes their rates by dividing the number of infant deaths in 1984 by the number of live births in that year.

 

Infant Mortality 87

POSTNEONATAL MORTALITY

The null regression model for the
log-odds of postneonatal death for
these data gives a deviance of 13,213
on 15 degrees of freedom and clearly
does not fit the data. Adding the factors birthweight, cohort, and race in
the same manner as in the neonatal
model also gives a significant reduction
in the deviance at each stage. The postneonatal additive model does not fit
the data with deviance of 424 on 10 degrees of freedom. Adding the two-way
interactions in the same manner as in
the neonatal analysis also gives a significant reduction in the deviance at
each step, but the postneonatal model
with all main effects and all two-way
interactions does not quite fit the data
(deviance = 8.2 on 3 degrees of freedom), indicating that the effect of
birthweight on survival differs not only
for the two cohorts and for the two
races, but that the change in the effect
of birthweight over time differs for the
two races, 1.e., the three-way interaction term has a significant effect. However, since this three-way interaction is
significant for only the very low birthweight infants, and then just barely so,
this three-way interaction effect (and
the associated saturated model) will
not be utilized in the interpretation of
the results.

The parameter estimates given in
Table 3 are for the model with all main
effects and all two-way interaction effects. The parameter estimate for cohort indicates the improvement in
postneonatal morality for white normal birthweight infants was not as
great as the decline in neonatal mortality. Still, normal birthweight whites
born in 1984 experienced only 51 per

Low birthweight infants are at a distinct disadvantage for survival during
the postneonatal period, though the
magnitude of the effect is not nearly as
high as in the neonatal period. And
while the greatest improvements in the
odds of survival occurred for the lower
birthweight categories in the neonatal
period, the opposite was true for the
postneonatal period, i.e., the odds of
postneonatal survival for normal birthweight infants improved more during
the period than did those for lower
birthweight infants.

The attenuation of the Native
American disadvantage at relatively
small birthweights seen in the neonatal
data also holds for the postneonatal period but only at the very low birth

Table 4 gives the relative risks and
confidence intervals for the risk of Native American postneonatal death relative to whites for each birthweight/

the reduction of the overall Native
American postneonatal mortality risk
from 27.5 (RR = 5.2) in 1960 to 6.2
(RR = 2.1) in 1984. Though these
relative risks remained significantly

except the lowest in 1984, the magnitude of the difference was substantially

butions makes little difference in the
relative risk of postneonatal death for
Native Americans. The birthweight
distributions again played little role in
the divergent mortality risks for whites
and Native Americans in months two
to twelve.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Our stratified and multivariate analyses have shown that while the odds for
survival improved dramatically for
both Native American and white infants between 1960 and 1984, the extent of the improvements differed for
these two ethnic groups, for the neonatal and postneonatal periods, and for
the four birthweight categories used in
this study. Native American neonatal
mortality risk dropped from 20.2 in
1960 to 5.2 in 1984, and the corresponding relative risk for Native
Americans with respect to whites fell
from 1.31 in 1960 to a nonsignificant
difference in 1984. Postneonatal mortality risks for Native Americans fell
from 27.5 in 1960 to 6.2 in 1984, with a
corresponding drop in the relative risk
from 5.21 to 2.10. Though the odds for
survival improved within almost every
age/birthweight category over the period,” the improvement of neonatal
survival occurred more at the lower
birthweights, while improvements of
postneonatal survival occurred more at
the higher birthweights.

In 1960, Native Americans experienced substantially higher odds of

7The only exception was for postneonatal survival for very low birthweight infants. This could be
the result of improved survival of very frail infants
during the first month of life, who may then live on
in a weakened state and experience relatively high
risks of mortality during the rest of the year (see
London 1993).

death than whites in both the neonatal
and postneonatal period. Between
1960 and 1984, the odds of both neonatal and postneonatal survival for Native American infants improved more
than did the odds for whites, but this
gap in the odds of survival narrowed
more in the postneonatal period. Still,
Native Americans experienced over
twice the risk of postneonatal death as
whites by 1984, while the risks of neonatal death for the two ethnic groups
were about the same. Furthermore,
while the majority of white infant
deaths occurred during the first month
of life during both years, most Native
American infant deaths occurred during the postneonatal period in both
1960 and in 1984.

As found in earlier research, birthweight was positively associated with
survival (Rogers, 1989; McCormick,
1985; Eberstein and Parker, 1984) for
both groups, but low and very low
birthweights had less of a deleterious
effect on Native American infants than
for whites during the neonatal period.
This pattern was maintained only for
very low birthweight Native Americans during the postneonatal period,
but the magnitude of the effect was
substantial.

These results also confirm other
studies that find excessive postneonatal
mortality risks for Native Americans.
We conclude that this discrepancy between the risks of white and Native
American postneonatal death has not
been due to disparate birthweight distributions between the two groups, nor
has the birthweight distribution played
a major role in former disparities in
neonatal mortality. This finding belies
Eberstein and Parker’s (1984) promotion of birthweight distribution as a

major indicator of “risk and/or patterns of infant mortality within a population” (p. 316).° i
Further research should develop
and test hypotheses to explore the reasons for Native Americans’ postneonatal disadvantage to give policy makers
the tools they need to design programs
to combat this persistent health problem. Since most Native American in‘© fants deaths still occur during the post& neonatal period (when environmental

8Their data analysis only distinguishes ethnic differences between white and nonwhite, and the majority of nonwhite infants in their study are black.
Black patterns of infant mortality are quite distinct
from Native American patterns (Task Force on
Black and Minority Health 1986). Their study is also
limited to infants born in the state of Florida in 1975.

Though Eberstein and Parker question the utility of a neonatal/postneonatal conceptual approach
and instead opt for an analysis of cause-specific
death rates, this difference in approach is unlikely to
affect conclusions about the importance of birthweight in the aggregate, since several of the most
important causes of Native American infant death
(see Honigfeld and Kaplan, 1987) are precisely
those that are unaccounted for by birthweight in
Eberstein and Parker’s study.

The attenuation of the Native
American disadvantage at low and
very low birthweights’? also warrants
further attention to determine whether
this is a problem of data quality (are
the most frail Native American low
birthweight infants least likely to be reported?) or the result of heavy investment in intensive care technology for
low birthweight infants at hospitals
that serve Native Americans.
