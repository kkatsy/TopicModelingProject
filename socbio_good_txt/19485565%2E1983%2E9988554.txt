Religion and Intensity of Inbreeding

in Tamil Nadu, South India

ABSTRACT: A representative random sample of 11,628 rural couples and 8,998 urban couples
from North Arcot District of Tamil Nadu in South India are under follow up since 1969 in a
study of inbreeding effects. This paper describes the level of inbreeding and its relationship to
religion of the couples. Wright’s F for autosomal genes in the rural and urban areas were 0.0371
and 0.0205, respectively. The F for sex-linked genes was significantly higher than that for autosomal and was 0.0411 in the rural areas and 0.0228 in the urban. Hindus had the highest inbreeding coefficients as compared to Muslims or Christians for both autosomal and sex-linked
genes, but there were significant variations among the different castes. The level of inbreeding
among Muslims and Christians was similar and fairly high. Significant rural-urban differentials persist in all religions. There is no appreciable change in the level of inbreeding over the
past few decades in any religion, although minor declines are observed in certain castes in the

urban areas.

The institution of marriage and the
prohibition of marital alliances among
persons of certain kinship categories are
both conditioned by religion (Lorimer,
1954). However, cultural practices may
at times transcend religious barriers and
marriage regulations may be relaxed as
in the case of consanguineous marriages
in South India (Sastri, 1976). Several authors have described the high degree of
inbreeding prevailing in South India and
have examined broadly its relationship
to specific demographic and socioeconomic variables (Sanghvi, 1966; Centerwall et al., 1969; Reid, 1973; Roychoudhury, 1976, 1980).

Studies in and around the town of
Vellore in North Arcot District, Tamil
Nadu, have shown that the proportion
of consanguineous marriages constituted nearly 47 per cent of the total mar
riages in the rural areas and 29 per cent
in the urban (Rao and Inbaraj, 1977).
Although the per cent of consanguineous marriages was the highest for Hindus, it was nevertheless high in Muslims
and Christians as well.

Further, in more than 80 per cent of
the consanguineous marriages, regardless of religion, the spouses were first
cousins or more closely related. However, there were marked differences by
religion in the preferences for different
varieties of first-cousin marriages. The
intensity of inbreeding, especially in the
case of sex-linked genes, would therefore vary by religion. In most of the current literature, inbreeding levels are
computed for autosomal genes and data
based on sex-linked genes are rather
rare. In the present paper, the variations
in inbreeding levels based on both auto

somal and sex-linked genes among various religious groups are described and
discussed,

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The population and samples for this
research were taken from the North Arcot District of Tamil Nadu in South India, the demographic characteristics of
which are fairly typical of that prevailing
in other parts of the State (Rao and Inbaraj, 1977). Fifty per cent of the rural
community development block and
one-third of the town of Vellore, the
headquarters of North Arcot District,
constituted the areas for the study.

All the married women in the selected areas were contacted by qualified
women investigators to collect relevant
data on socioeconomic, demographic,
and inbreeding levels. For each marriage, a family pedigree was drawn extending upward to two earlier generations on the side of each spouse in order
to determine the existence and type of
consanguinity involved. This procedure
was followed uniformly for all marriages. The investigators were trained
adequately in interview techniques for
drawing pedigrees and their approaches
standardized. Every pedigree was
checked with at least one other adult
member of the family. Five per cent of
all married women were reinterviewed
by supervisory personnel to check the
validity of the pedigrees, and misclassifications were very rare (Rao and Inbaraj, 1977).

The frequency of consanguinity was
expressed as a proportion of all such
marriages among total marriages contracted during a given time period of
study and the coefficient of inbreeding, f
(Wright, 1922), computed. The value of
f would be 0 in the absence of consanguinity and 1 when there was complete

Rao

 

Social Biology

inbreeding. The inbreeding coefficient,
jf, was determined in each case assuming
autosomal as well as sex-linked transmission of genes. Thus, while the value
of f (autosomal) for the first-cousin matings would be uniformly !/16 or 0.0625,
the value of f (sex-linked) will vary between 0 and 0.1875 depending on the
type of transmission through males in
the pedigree.

A weighted mean F, taking into account the relative frequencies of various
values of F, was determined for the total
population and for the subgroups thereof, separately for autosomal and for sexlinked genes.

Although Fis a parameter characterizing offspring and not the mated couples, for the purpose of this paper, the
number of couples and not the number
of offspring are used in the various computations.

For each marriage, the value of F and
other relevant data were coded and
transferred to 80-column punch cards.
An IBM-370 computer was used in tabulations and statistical analysis.

RESULTS

A total of 20,626 couples were studied, of whom 11,628 were from the rural
area and 8,998 from the urban. The
analyses were carried out separately for
women born prior to 1940 and for those
born thereafter, as given in Table 1.

in the urban areas, while in the younger
cohort the coefficients were 0.0369 and
0.0202, respectively. These differences
in the two cohorts were not statistically
significant. Similarly, the inbreeding
coefficients for sex-linked genes did not
reveal statistically significant differences. The rural-urban differences as
well as the difference between autosomal and sex-linked coefficients, however, were statistically significant (P <
0.001).

The inbreeding coefficients according to religion are given in Table 4.

In every religion, the inbreeding
coefficients for the sex-linked genes
were higher than those for the autosomal
genes, but the difference attained statistical significance (P < 0.05) only among
the Hindus and Muslims. In both the rural and urban areas, the Hindus had a
higher inbreeding coefficient (P <
0.001) for autosomal as well as for sexlinked genes.

The trends in the levels of inbreeding
by birth cohorts of women in the three
religions groups are depicted in Figure 1.

The differences between the two
birth cohorts fail to attain statistical
significance.

The inbreeding coefficients by caste
grouping among Hindus are shown in
Table 5.

The coefficients for sex-linked genes
were significantly (P < 0.05) higher
than those for the autosomal genes
among all the three caste groups in the
rural as well as in the urban areas. The
autosomal and sex-linked coefficients
were highest for the backward castes in
both rural and urban areas; they were
lowest for the forward castes in the rural
and for scheduled castes in the urban areas. The differences between the highest
and lowest values are statistically significant (P < 0.001).

statistical significance (P < 0.05) for
both autosomal and sex-linked genes for
Mudaliars and Reddiars and for autosomal genes only for Brahmins.

The inbreeding coefficients among
the selected backward castes are shown
in Table 7.

As in the case of forward castes, there
are significant variations among the
backward castes (P < 0.05). In the rural
area, the inbreeding coefficient for autosomal genes was highest for the Barbers
(0.0547) and lower for the Dhobis
(0.0369); the sex-linked inbreeding
coefficient was highest for the Barbers
(0.0580) and lowest for the Acharis
(0.0381). In the urban area, the coef

the Naickers (0.0253). The urban inbreeding coefficients were generally less
than those in the rural areas, such differences attaining statistical significance ( P

Naickers, and Naidus and for autosomal

cantly less than those in rural areas for
the castes (P < 0.001). Further analysis
of these castes did not reveal any significant changes in the autosomal or sexlinked inbreeding coefficient between
the women of the two birth cohorts.

In the rural area, both autosomal and
sex-linked inbreeding coefficients were
significantly higher among the Cobblers
as compared to the Harijans (P <
0.001), while in the urban area the reverse seems to be the case, these differences attaining statistical significance (P
< 0.01).

DISCUSSION

The average inbreeding coefficient,
F, in most human populations is found
to be generally less than 1 per 1,000
(Cavelli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971). The
situation that prevails in South India
may therefore be considered exceptional. The frequency of consanguinity
in a population depends not only on the
population structure but also on social
customs and religious sanctions. While
Marriages between blood relatives are
preferred for economic or political reasons, such marriages were also tabooed
for sociological reasons and in some
cases due to a recognition that there was
a greater chance a malformed child
would result if the child’s parents were
close relatives. These must have led to
the enactment of the early social laws
prohibiting consanguinity.

Very close consanguineous matings,
such as parent-offspring and brotherSister marriages, are considered incest
and forbidden in all societies. Marriages
with a sib’s progeny (uncle-niece or
aunt-nephew) are incestuous and illegal
in some societies, permissible under
specific dispensation in some others,
and permitted or even considered desir

able as in South Indian communities. In
Jewish religious law 43 kinds of marriages of relatives are prohibited, 17 are
mentioned in the Pentateuch (Lev.
18:6-18), and 26 added in the Talmud
(Stine, 1977). The Roman Catholic
Church requires a special dispensation
for marriages as close as first cousins but
many religions such as Orthodox Judaism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and
Shintoism do not prohibit first-cousin
marriages.

The actual impact of religion and
marriage and fertility has been much
discussed in social circles and has several
biological implications. In an attempt to
study the effects of Buddhism and Catholicism on an island population in Japan, Schull et al. (1962) demonstrate
differences not only in the incidence of
inbreeding but in several biological features between individuals of a common
race isolated from one another only by
religion. On the other hand, Chamie
(1977) while admitting significant fertility differentials among Muslims and
among Christians in Lebanon, cautioned that it would be misleading to
speak of Muslim-Christian fertility differences. Religion was an important
characteristic in differentiating fertility
behavior, but only at certain socioeconomic levels. For example, at low levels
of wife’s education, the differentials
were great; at high levels of wife’s education, religious differentials were insignificant.

Such generalizations are invalid in India too. Muslims and Christians in Bombay practice all four types of first-cousin
marriages, while these two religious
communities did not permit the two
types of parallel cousin marriages in Andhra Pradesh (Sanghvi, 1966; Basu,
1975). The local customs of Andhra Pradesh had deeper roots than could be

420

modified by religious influence that
came at a later stage. The fact that inbreeding is practically nonexistent in
Hindus of northern India, whereas it has
the highest incidence of all religions in
the south, speaks of the dominance of
local culture over religion. Likewise, a
significantly high level of inbreeding is
reported in a small group of Bhatias anda
few other North Indian Hindu communities at present settled in North India, owing perhaps to prolonged cultural contact with the predominant
Muslim population of the area they had
inhabited (now in Pakistan) prior to
their displacement (Bhalla and Bhatia,
1974). In the 1961 census survey on the
incidence of inbreeding in India, the inbreeding levels of Christian tribals in
Northeastern parts were shown to be
lower than those of their counterparts
elsewhere, mainly due to their higher
social and educational status (Roychoudhury, 1976).

As among Muslims and Christians,
wide variations are observed between
the various castes among Hindus in both
the extent of inbreeding and in the types
of matings preferred. This seems more
in line with the caste-cluster concept of
Karve (1961) rather than with the classical interpretation of the Indian caste system where each Hindu by birth belongs
to one of the four Varnas (color)—
Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and
Shudras; each Varna then is broken into
several castes and subcastes, each caste
normally being present in one linguistic
area. The classical model thus assumes a
continuous process of fragmentation,
whereas Karve’s model suggests that the
subcastes are not invariably derivable
from caste, but are patterned through
migration. A group moving from one
place to another perhaps entrenches itself in the caste structure by assuming a

Rao

 

Social Biology

caste name to indicate its status, at the
same time retaining its group character
through endogamy (Malhotra, 1976).
The caste system was an experiment on
a grand scale that attempted to breed varieties of men genetically specialized in
the performance of different functions.
To all appearances, such a specialization
has not been achieved (Dobzhansky,
1967).

The inbreeding coefficient, F, as
defined by Sewall Wright (1922), is the
correlation between uniting gametes. In
dealing with the contributions to inbreeding by a particular form of consanguineous mating, Wright’s F will also
denote the probability that a pair of alleles are autozygous or identical by descent (Malecot, 1948; Reid, 1973). Most
studies on consanguinity have reported
inbreeding coefficients for autosomal
genes only. In view of the hemizygosity
of males for X-linked genes, the probabilities of transmission of an X-linked
trait would depend on the type of consanguineous mating involved and differ
from that of autosomal genes. Where inbreeding coefficients for sex-linked
genes are reported, they are shown to be
invariably higher than that for autosomal (Sanghvi, 1966; Veerraju, 1973).
This is not surprising because of the
higher incidence of matrilateral crosscousin marriages as compared to other
varieties of first-cousin marriages as
shown in the present study. However,
the range of differences varied from one
religion to another, and among the variOuS Castes.

Genetic effects of inbreeding can be
traced to the fact that the inbreeding individual may carry a double dose of a
gene that was present in a single dose in
the common ancestor. A recessive gene
carried in a single dose in a common ancestor may remain hidden until it comes

 
Vol. 30, No. 4

to light for the first time in an inbreeding
descendent. Intuitively we expect,
therefore, that a recessive trait will occur with increased frequency in the
progeny of consanguineous mates.
Thus, consanguinity is important in the
study of recessive inheritance and of recessive traits. With a high level of inbreeding still prevailing in South India,
and with large populations of any reli, gious group resorting to specific prefer= ences of blood relatives, it should be in
