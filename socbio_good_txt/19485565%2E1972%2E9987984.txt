The Effect of Fecundity on Fertility
in Rural East Pakistan (Bangladesh) *

The relationship between fecundity (the
biological capacity for reproduction) and
fertility has been neglected in population
research. Several studies have focused upon
a component of fecundity, fecundability,
usually defined as the monthly probability
of conception (Jain, 1969a, 19695; Potter
and Sakoda, 1967; James, 1963; Tietze,
1959). Others have attempted to identify
the fecund segments of a population (Badenhorst and Higgens, 1962; Whelpton,
Campbell, Patterson, 1966). However,
only one study (Harter, 1970), conducted
in the United States, has attempted to
answer the fundamental question, “What
is the effect of fecundity upon the fertility
of a population?” This question is basic
to all fertility research since the level of
fecundity obviously places limits on the
actual reproductive performance of a population.

The objectives of the present investigation are, first, to assess the level of fecundity and its variation between selected
segments of a population and, second, to

have maintained throughout this paper the designations of areas and agencies as they were at the
time of the investigation.

assess the effect of fecundity upon agespecific birth rates, total fertility rates, and
estimates of completed family size.

The investigation was conducted under
the auspices of the Pakistan-SEATO
Cholera Research Laboratory (P-SCRL)
on a rural population located in Matlab
thana (an area of approximately a hundred square miles) in the south central
portion of East Pakistan. The P-SCRL was
established in 1960 to develop, improve,
and demonstrate measures for the prevention and eventual eradication of cholera. A
major component of the program is the
conduct of controlled field trials of cholera
vaccines, The basic design of these field
trials involves taking a complete census
in the area under study and assigning an
identifying census number to every individual. The vaccines to be tested are
randomly assigned to the population and
administered by vaccine teams. In order
to detect all cholera cases, field workers
visit every household daily to make inquiries about the occurrence of acute diarrheal illnesses. Since 1963 the population
under study has been expanded from
28,000 (23 villages) to 225,000 (243 villages). From 1966 to the present, the field
staff has maintained a regular registration

of all births, deaths, and migrations in
addition to conducting their regular surveillance for actual diarrheal diseases.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Data on fecundity were obtained by interviewing all ever-married women in 132
villages of Matlab thana in January and
February, 1968. Forty field assistants conducted the interviews on 30,155 evermarried women of all ages. These same
assistants had conducted a census of all
the households in the same villages in
1966. The census data together with the
registration of all new persons in the area
provided the information needed to identify all of the ever-married women in each
household.

Two fecundity status groups were defined: (1) fecund—women who had given
birth during the year or had been pregnant
and those currently pregnant, lactating,
experiencing post-partum amenorrhea, or
“regularly” menstruating. “Regularly”
menstruating was defined as a woman who
had menstruated for six or more months
in the year; (2) subfecund—women who
were definitely sterile due to operation or
disease, had reached menopause, had not
attained menarche, or who menstruated
‘trregularly.” “Irregular” menstruation
was defined as the absence of menstruation
during the last six months of the year
without pregnancy.

Six months was designated as the criterion for “regularity” of menstruation for
the following reasons. It was assumed that
women who had not menstruated for a
shorter period within the six month interval could still be fecund since they may
be pregnant and not know it or could have
been pregnant and aborted and were experiencing amenorrhea at the time of
interview. In addition, a six-month interval allowed for women in the older age
groups who were just reaching menopause

Social Biology

during mid-year to be counted as subfecund and girls who were attaining menarche at mid-year to be counted as fecund.

Admittedly this classification scheme
can provide only a rough estimate of
fecundity and its shortcomings should be
made clear. First, this definition is intended to yield an estimate of the fecundity status in the previous year so that its
effect upon the fertility of the present year
can be assessed. Hence, the major assumption is that the fecundity of 30,155 evermarried women in the year under study
would not have altered significantly from
the previous year. It should be noted,
however, that the part of the estimate
this affects most specifically is the category
defined by “regularity” of menstruation.

Second, the scheme does not measure
couple fecundity, but only female fecundity. Hence, husbands who are sterile are
not included. This produces an overestimation of actual reproductive capacity when
a fecund woman has a sterile husband. In
the present situation, however, this effect
is assumed to be minimal since preliminary
survey results have indicated that fewer
than 1% of the males in the area were
sterilized (Ahmad, 1970).

Third, women classed as “regularly”
menstruating may have fecundity impairments due to physical disorders which are
not reflected by irregular menstruation,
e.g., endometriosis! This could result in
overestimating the number of fecund
women, particularly in age groups where
such disorders are more prevalent. The
medical examinations required to diagnose
these disorders are beyond the scope of
the present investigation.

Finally, those women who have had a
“relatively” long interval since last birth
or a history of high fetal wastage are not .
identified and could still be considered

associated with subfecundity.

Vol. 19, No. 2

fecund under the present definition. Although such women may still be fecundable, their inclusion in the fecund segment
could tend to overestimate actual reproductive capacity. In the classification of
fecundity used in the Growth of American
Families (GAF) study (Whelpton, Campbell, Patterson, 1966) and in a South African study (Badenhorst and Higgens, 1962)
such women were categorized as “probably sterile’ and ‘“semi-fecund,” respectively, and not included as fecund. It is
possible that a portion of these women
were included as subfecund in the present
study because some may menstruate irregularly. However, in sum, it would appear that the present definition of fecundity generally tends to overestimate actual
female reproductive capacity.

The data for births used in the calculation of fertility rates were obtained from
the birth reports for all births registered
in the area for the period January 1 to
December 31, 1967. Collection of these
data involves the following. A local female
resident (field worker) of each village
visits each household daily to check for
any births (or deaths). Her work and
record keeping is supervised by male field
assistants. (Each field assistant has from
3 to 5 field workers under supervision.)
These assistants visit each family an
average of once weekly to record the vital
events on standard forms which are
checked against the information collected
by the female resident. Supervision of the
work of the field assistant is conducted by
sanitary inspectors who visit each household twice a month to check on the
completeness of the registration. These
workers in turn are supervised by the
field surveillance supervisor and his deputy
who are responsible for the coordination
of the field work.

Record linkage with the interview data
was used to match the registered births

with their mothers. Of the 5,151 births
recorded for the year, 96% were matched.
The remaining 4% were not matched due
to the temporary or permanent out-migration or death of the mother.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

As shown in Table 1, slightly over 70%
of all ever-married women were fecund.
Their fecundity, as would be expected,
exhibits a close association with age. The
proportion fecund is relatively low in the
age group 10-14 and rises abruptly in the
15-19 group where the level of 96-99%
is maintained through ages 25-29. From
this point on, however, the proportion
fecund exhibits a steady decline through
the remaining portion of the age structure.

Table 1 also provides the basis for a
comparison of levels of fecundity between
various marital statuses. First, the proportions fecund for “divorced or separated” women are slightly lower throughout the age structure than the proportions
fecund for women “living with husband.”
A possible explanation for this finding for
the age structure 15 years and older is
that one of the reasons for divorce and
separation in this society is the inability
of a wife to bear children. Hence, this
could operate as a selective factor to increase the proportion of subfecund among
the divorced or separated women. In the
youngest portion of the age structure,
10-14 years, the “separated” group may
include premenarchal girls who have been
contracted for marriage but as yet the
marriage has not been consummated. This
would also tend to reduce the proportion
fecund.

Secondly, the proportions fecund among
“widowed” women are consistently lower
throughout the age structure (with differences as great as 16 and 12 points in
the age groups 40-44 and 20-24 years,
respectively) than the proportions fecund

among women “living with husband.”
This could be due to the tendency of
widowed women (Muslim) to underreport
their age to increase the possibility of
remarriage. If this occurred throughout
the age structure, then widowed women of
a given age group would actually be older
than women within the group who are living with their husbands. Since fecundity
is related to age, the result would be as
indicated: lower proportions fecund among
“widowed” than among women “living
with husband.”

Another factor which may contribute
to this difference is widow remarriage.
Perhaps those widows who have already
remarried represent a more fecund group,
since a factor which aids remarriage could
be past performance in childbearing. That
is, a “young widow” who has demonstrated
her ability to bear children would be more
desirable than a widow who hasn’t. This
would reduce the proportions fecund
among those widows who remain unmarried.

A final explanation centers around the
age differential between the deceased husband and the widow. As would be expected,
widowed women had husbands who were,
on the average, older than husbands of
currently married women. A reason for
this difference could be that something
was initially wrong with the woman which
made her undesirable for marriage. In this
society, where arranged marriage is the
norm, these women may have been married to the last possible alternative, a man
older than usually desired by the family.
Further, if the undesirability was related
to potential inability to bear children
(e.g., irregularity of menstruation) this
could result in a higher proportion of
widows who are subfecund.

The relationship between fecundity, age,
and number of living children is presented
in Table 2 for women living with hus

bands.* The results indicate that among
younger women (15-29 years old), the
proportion fecund shows little or no variation with number of living children. A
slight variation occurs in this pattern in
the following age group, 30-34, where the
proportion fecund for women who are
childless is almost 8 points lower than the
proportion fecund for women who have
one or more living children.

A distinctive break with previous patterns occurs in the next two age groups.
At ages 35-39, the proportion fecund increased between no living children and
2-4, then increased again for women with
5 or more living children. The relationship
at ages 40-44 illustrates the pattern suggested in the previous group with a direct
association between the proportion fecund
and the number of living children. This
pattern is not as evident in the 45-49
year group where there is a decrease in the
proportion fecund between women who are
childless and those with 1 or 2 living children. However, the proportion does increase from this point on, with the 4-6
living children group having about equal
proportions and the 7-++ living children
group showing the highest proportion.
Generally, in the remaining age group, 50
years and older, the proportion fecund
shows little variation with number of
living children.

These results seem to indicate that the
primary factor influencing fecundity for
those women below 35 years is age. However, women with larger families generally
have higher proportions fecund than those
with smaller families.

Table 3 illustrates the results of calculating age-specific and total fertility rates
for all women living with husband and

for the portion of those women who are
fecund. The findings indicate that subfecundity operates to reduce the total
fertility rate by about 0.8 births per
woman. Between the ages of 15 and 34 the
reduction is rather small. The major reductions occur in the age groups 10-14
and 35-49 where subfecundity is high.
Since subfecundity is lowest in the age
groups making the greatest contribution
to total fertility, its overall impact is
minimized. Hence, in the absence of contraception, subfecundity could not be expected to reduce total fertility beyond one
birth per woman, assuming that the women
reproduced throughout their childbearing
period according to the current fertility
schedule.

Another important aspect of the effect
of fecundity upon fertility is the impact
that current family size has upon this relationship. As seen in Table 4, the reduction in total fertility due to subfecundity
begins at a low of 0.2 births for childless
women and increases to 0.4 births for
women with 2 or 3 living children. The

Fecundity and Fertility

199

largest reduction occurs for women with
4 living children at 0.9, then drops to
0.6 and 0.5, respectively, for women with
5 to 6 and 7-+- children. Thus, the major
impact of subfecundity upon fertility occurs in the larger family sizes. However, it
should be pointed out that the differences
in fertility rates with the exception of
women with 4 children are generally small.

Table 5 provides another estimate of
completed family size for women “living
with husband” and for the portion of those
women who are fecund which takes into
account the mortality conditions omitted
in the total fertility rate. If the rates of
infant and childhood mortality which
would occur to the children as they aged to
the end of the mothers reproductive period
are applied (life-table technique), the
expected completed family size of fecund
women (holding female mortality constant) is slightly over 6 children as compared to about 5.5 children for all women
‘living with husband”.

Including the female mortality which
would occur to the women as they aged
to the completion of childbearing, as well
as the mortality conditions for births,
yields a completed family size of almost
7 surviving children for each surviving
fecund woman and slightly over 6 children
for all women “living with husband”.
Obviously these results are also hypothetical since the mortality conditions applied
refer to current rates. However, the measure does provide a more realistic estimate of potential completed family size
than the total fertility rate.

SUMMARY

An analysis of fecundity and its effect
upon fertility in a rural area of East
Pakistan in 1968 indicates that of 30,155
ever-married women over two-thirds were
fecund. Their fecundity varied inversely

(V = 592) who are fecund show a similar
relation with age, but their proportions
fecund are generally lower than those for
married women “living with husbands”.

Fecundity of women “living with husbands” was also related to total number of
living children; that is, those women with
larger families had higher proportions
fecund than those with smaller families.
This relationship was most apparent in
the older age groups.

The effect of subfecundity on the total
fertility rate was found to account for a
reduction of about 0.8 births. The major
reduction in age-specific fertility due to
subfecundity occurred in the age groups
making the lowest contribution to total
fertility. In addition, an estimate of completed family size taking into account the
mortality which would occur to all births
and women indicated that irrespective of
subfecundity, if current fertility and mortality conditions persisted, completed
family sizes would be of the order of 6
surviving children per surviving woman.
