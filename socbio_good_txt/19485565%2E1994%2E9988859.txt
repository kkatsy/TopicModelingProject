ABSTRACT: Data from the First and Second Malaysian Family Life Surveys in 1976 and 1988,
respectively, are analyzed to examine long-term trends in breastfeeding in Peninsular Malaysia,
educational and ethnic differences therein, and the quality of retrospective data on infant
feeding. The steady decrease between the mid-1950’s and mid-1970’s in breastfeeding was
reversed to become a nearly monotonic increase since 1975. Part of the change is attributable to
the changing composition of the Malaysian population. Over time, the percentages of births to
subgroups with higher rates of breastfeeding—particularly Malays and more highly educated
women—have increased. However, there is also evidence of changes in rates of breastfeeding
within these subgroups. Many Malaysian infants have a total duration of breastfeeding (including
with supplementation) considerably shorter than WHO’s recommended four months of exclusive
(unsupplemented) breastfeeding. Moreover, nearly aj] breastfed infants are first given supplementary food or beverage shortly after birth. Breastfeeding promotion efforts in Malaysia need
to emphasize the appropriate timing of and types of supplementary feeding.

Breastfeeding has been advocated
as the optimal form of nutrition for infants. In developing countries, the benefits of breastfeeding have been shown
to be life-saving (Habicht et al., 1986;
Martorell and Ho, 1984; Martorell et
al., 1984), especially in areas where
water and sanitation are poor (Habicht
et al., 1988). Furthermore, in some
parts of the world, breastfeeding is still
the major means of birthspacing, especially among the poorest women
(Short, 1987; World Bank, 1984). The
World Health Organization (WHO)
and the American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommend that infants
be fully breastfed (without any supplementation) for four to six months
(WHO, 1989; American Academy of
Pediatrics, 1980). |

In the 1970's and early 1980’s there
was a widespread perception that
breastfeeding incidence and duration

 

 

61

were decreasing in many developing
countries, causing considerable concern about the possible health consequences (Berg, 1973; WHO, 1982),
and leading to efforts by WHO and
UNICEF, among others, to promote
breastfeeding (Grant, 1988). However, comparative analyses have found
very wide variation in both the proportion of infants ever breastfed and typical durations of breastfeeding, with no
evidence of a universal decline (Popkin
et al., 1982; Thapa and Williamson,
1991; Trussell et al., 1992; Popkin, et
al., 1989). In several countries and regions in which breastfeeding declines
had been recorded, more recent reports have shown an end and even reversal to that trend (Joesoef et al.,
1989; Millman, 1986).
Documentation of trends in breastfeeding in developing countries, however, has been limited by the lack of

comparable data for several points in
time. The First Malaysian Family Life
Survey (MFLS-1) in Peninsular Malaysia in 1976-77 was one of the few
datasets to include a complete retrospective history of women’s breastfeeding experiences, permitting a documentation of the long-term trends in
breastfeeding initiation and duration.
Those data revealed a general decline
in the proportion of infants breastfeeding from 92 per cent in 1953 to under 78
per cent in 1977 (Haaga, 1986). However, the data also suggested a reversal
of the long-term trend in the 1970’s,
with breastfeeding rates being significantly higher in 1975-77 (79 per cent)
than in 1970-74 (75 per cent) (Haaga,
1986). Haaga investigated whether this
apparent reversal could be due to biases, such as Hawthorne effects, selection bias, or recall error, and concluded that those were not likely.
The purpose of this paper is to use
new data, from the Second Malaysian
Family Life Survey (MFLS-2) in
1988-89, to examine whether the
breastfeeding upturn that was detected in the mid-1970’s continued, or
whether it was simply a temporary fluctuation around the long-term trend.
We also examine the trend in the duration of breastfeeding. Like MFLS-1,
the MFLS-2 data contain complete
retrospective histories on the initiation
and duration of breastfeeding for several thousand women, enabling us to
update breastfeeding trends for Peninsular Malaysia through the late 1980’s.
The retrospective life history was administered both to a new group of
women of reproductive age (the
“New” sample) and to the same
women who were the respondents to
MFLS-1 in 1976-77 (the “Panel” sam

ple). Since both the MFLS-1 and
MFLS-2 surveys asked virtually the
same questions about breastfeeding,
data from the Panel sample provide the
unique opportunity to assess the quality of long-term recall.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA

Data for this study are from the
MFLS-1 in 1976-77 and from two
samples (the ““New” and the “Panel”
samples) of the MFLS-2 in 1988-89.
The samples for each survey consist
of randomly selected private households in Peninsular Malaysia. In the
MFLS-1, households that contained at
least one ever-married woman 50 years
old or younger were included in the
sample frame. A total of 1,262 households (88 per cent of the eligible probability sample) completed Round 1 of
the survey. These households are contained in 52 primary sampling areas in
Peninsular Malaysia, of which 49 were
randomly selected; the other three
were purposely selected to give additional representation to Indian households and households in fishing communities.! Our analysis of MFLS-1
data in this paper excludes women living in the three purposively selected areas and weights to adjust for the number of ever-married women in each
household.

The MFLS-2 collected data on the
breastfeeding (among many other topics) of all births to women covered by
MFLS-1 (the “Panel” sample) and a
“New” sample of women of reproductive age (ages 18-49 plus ever-married

women under 18). There are 889 respondents in the Panel sample (a
follow-up rate, after 12 years, of 71 per
cent of the women interviewed in
MFLS-1) and 2,184 respondents in the
New sample (just over 90 per cent of
those presumed eligible) (Haaga et al.,
1993). The analyses of the New sample
presented here are weighted to adjust
for the oversampling of Indians (who
comprise only 10 per cent of the Peninsular Malaysian population) and for
the fact that if there was more than one
eligible woman in a household, only
one was selected at random to be the
main respondent.

In both MFLS-1 and MFLS-2, a
Female Life History questionnaire was
administered to each selected woman.
This instrument collected complete
pregnancy histories, including information on the initiation of breastfeeding and durations of unsupplemented
and supplemented breastfeeding of all
of the woman’s births. Virtually the
same questions about breastfeeding
were asked in both surveys.

MEASURES

We consider both the initiation of
breastfeeding (percentage of babies
who ever breastfed) and the percentage who breastfed at least four months.
As noted above, WHO and the American Academy of Pediatrics currently
recommend that infants be fully breastfed (without any supplementation) for
four months. Clearly a child who is
completely weaned before four months
is not conforming to these recommendations. In Malaysia, babies are typically given some food or liquid other
than breast milk very soon after birth.
In these data, the durations of unsupplemented breastfeeding (defined as

 

Breastfeeding in Malaysia

63

breastfeeding with no regular [daily]
supplementation of any food or liquid,
including water?) are extremely short;
the median durations of unsupplemented breastfeeding that are reported in the MFLS—2 New sample are
one day for every ethnic and educational subgroup for all years considered. Breastfeeding rates (percentage
of babies who initiated breastfeeding
or who breastfed at least four months)
are reported here as three-year moving
averages to smooth some of the yearto-year variation in the data.

The questions asked about duration of breastfeeding were identical
in MFLS-1 and MFLS-2 (“How
long did you breastfeed (NAME
OF CHILD)?’’). However, the explanations of the question that asked
whether the child ever breastfed
(which immediately preceded the
question about duration of breastfeeding) differed slightly between the two
surveys. In both surveys, women were
asked “Did you breastfeed (NAME
OF CHILD)?” However, in MFLS-1
this question was followed with “I want
to know even if it was for a few days,”
while in MFLS-2, in an effort to pick
up more unsuccessful attempts at
breastfeeding, the qualification was
changed to “I want to know even if you
just tried once or twice.” Hence,
women who breastfed for only a day or
two might report that they didn’t
breastfeed in response to the MFLS-1
wording but that they did breastfeed in
response to the MFLS-2 wording.

This definition of full, or unsupplemented,
breastfeeding was used in the MFLSes because research has shown that even minimal supplements
have an adverse effect on the morbidity, nutritional
status, and mortality of infants (e.g., see Labbok
and Krasovec, 1990).

SAMPLES

The samples used here contain information on 4,824 births reported in
MFLS-1 for the 1953-1977 period and
on 5,907 births reported in MFLS-—2
New sample for the 1961-88 period.
(Only those births recorded in the
MFLS-2 sample which occurred after
1964 are used in analyses comparing
MFLS-1 and MFLS-2 data; ethnic
and educational subgroup analyses use
only MFLS-2 data and utilize all births
in that sample from 1961 to 1988.) The
ever-married portion of the New sample is comparable to the MFLS—1 sample, which consisted of ever-married
women under the age of 50 in 1976.

Because the MFLS-1 sample and
the MFLS-2 New sample are cohorts
of women under the age of 50 (in 1976
and 1988, respectively), as one uses the
data to refer to earlier years the samples do not represent the full range of
Malaysian women of reproductive age.
For example, in 1970, the oldest
woman in the MFLS-1 sample was 43
and the oldest woman in the MFLS~2
sample was 31. (This age difference
will cause relatively little problem for
the ten years before the interview dates
because the rate of childbearing 1s relatively low above age 40.) However,
there is relatively little variation in
breastfeeding with mother’s age in
these data. We adjust for changes over
time in the age composition of the sample primarily by limiting our analysis of
trends for the entire population to the
24 years preceding each survey. We
have also compared MFLS-1 and
MFLS-2 data on women from the
same birth cohort for the time period
covered by both of the surveys and

found that this does not affect any of
the results reported here.

Analyses of ethnic and educational
differentials use only data from the
MFLS-2 New sample, and include all
births back to 1961. All subgroups
cover the same age range in a given
year; hence, comparisons of rates
among subgroups are valid, with the
caveat that in the earlier years they
only refer to the younger segment of
the population of married women of
reproductive age. (However, as noted
above, differences in breastfeeding
among mothers of different ages are
not especially pronounced in these
data, especially relative to the ethnic
and educational differences.)

To assess the reliability of women’s
reports about breastfeeding, responses
reported by Panel sample women in
1988 (i.e., in MFLS-2) about 4,094
pre-1977 births are compared to responses in 1976 (1.e., in MFLS-1) by
these same women about these same
births. We compute the Kappa coefficient, a widely used statistic measuring
retest reliability (Cohen, 1960).3

Results are presented graphically.
In all figures, points are not graphed if
the sample sizes are less than 25. (Most
sample sizes exceed this lower limit
considerably. For example, the average number of births on which the
points in Figure 1 are based exceeds
700.) All statements about statistical
significance are based on a level of
p <0.05 or better.

3Kappa_ coefficient = (observed _ proportion
agreement-expected proportion agreement)/(1expected proportion agreement) (Cohen, 1960).

RESULTS
OVERALL TIME TRENDS

Figure 1 shows the long-term trends
in the percentage of Malaysian infants
who ever breastfed, as reported in
MFLS-1 and in the MFLS-2 New
sample. Both data sets show a steady
decrease in the breastfeeding rate until
the mid-1970’s, after which the rate increased. The last two points for the
MFLS-1 curve show the same upturn
that Haaga (1986) reported. The
MFLS-2 curve shows that this increase
indeed continued over the following
decade. The MFLS-2 breastfeeding

 

rates for the later 1980’s are significantly higher than the MFLS-~2 rates
for the mid-1970’s.

In Figure 2, we consider the percentage of infants who breastfed for
at least four months. Both data sets
show decreases in this indicator
through at least 1976. The MFLS-2
data show that this percentage increased in the 1980’s. The rate for
1987-89 is significantly higher than
for 1975-77. However, in the most recent years considered, just over onehalf of all babies were breastfed for at
least four months. That is, nearly half
of all babies had a duration of any

breastfeeding that is less than WHO’s
recommended four months duration of
exclusive breastfeeding.

Although MFLs-1 and MFLS-2
generally show similar trends for the
years covered by both surveys, the
rates from MFLS-1 are generally
lower than those from MFLS-2 for
both initiation of any breastfeeding
and for at least four months duration
of breastfeeding. For breastfeeding
initiation, the difference between the
MFLS-1 and MFLS-2 rates may be
due to the fact, noted above, that
MFLS-1 qualified its question with
“even if it was for a few days,”’ whereas

_ MFLS-2 instead said “‘even if you just

tried once or twice.’ Another possible
reason for the differences in both the
initiation and _at-least-four-months
measures is reporting bias. Breastfeeding was more popular and given more
attention in 1988 than in 1976 (Kandiah, 1992), and women may have
been more likely to report that they
breastfed in the later survey. Sudman
and Bradburn (1974) note the tendency of respondents in face-to-face interviews to over-report socially desirable behaviors and to under-report
socially undesirable behaviors. The
unique data that we have for the Panel
(re-interviewed) sample, where we
asked the same women 12 years later

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

about the same births, enables us to
look at these possibilities.

In the vast majority (93 per cent) of
the cases, women reported the same
answers in both surveys regarding
whether or not they breastfed a particular child. The Kappa coefficient has a
value of 0.70, which is considered to be
an ‘‘excellent’” degree of agreement
(Fleiss, 1981). However, Panel respondents in 1988 reported a higher average
breastfeeding rate for their pre-1977
births (87.2 per cent) than they had reported in 1976 for those same births
(84.3 per cent), a difference that is statistically significant (using a matched
pair test). That is, the 7 per cent of
women who reported different answers
in 1976 and 1988 were more likely to
have changed their answers from “‘did
not breastfeed” to “did breastfeed”’
than the reverse. Of the cases who reported in MFLS-1 that they did not
breastfeed but in MFLS-2 that they
did, the majority reported a fairly short
duration of breastfeeding in MFLS-—2
(though many of these are longer than
the “few days” mentioned in MFLS1): 13 per cent reported a duration of 3
days or less in MFLS-2; 25 per cent reported a duration of a week or less; 50
per cent reported a month or less; and
75 per cent reported four months or
less.

For the measure of whether the
child was breastfed for at least four
months, women’s responses are consistent between the two surveys for 85 per
cent of all infants. The Kappa coefficient in this case is 0.68, which is also
considered to be an “excellent” degree
of agreement. Again a higher percentage for pre-1977 births is reported
in MFLS-2 (63.2 per cent) than in
MFLS-1 (61.8 per cent), and this

difference, though smaller than for
breastfeeding initiation, is statistically
significant. This suggests that, although some of the difference between
MFLS-1 and MFLS-2 in breastfeeding initiation rates may be due to differences between the two surveys in
the way initiation was defined, for both
initiation and the at-least-four-months
measure the difference may also be
due to the fact that breastfeeding was
more socially acceptable in 1988 than
in 1976.

Overall, the trends in breastfeeding
from these two reports about the same
breastfeeding events are remarkably
similar, despite some disagreement between MFLS-1 and MFLS-2 concerning the proportions breastfed at all and
the proportions breastfed at least four
months. Furthermore, the extent of
disagreement is generally small relative to the ethnic and educational differentials discussed below. We now
disaggregate the data by mothers’ ethnicity and their educational attainment, to discern whether the breastfeeding upturns we see in Figures 1 and
2 also characterize subgroups of the
Malaysian population. The remaining
graphs present data from the MFLS-2
New sample for births during the period 1961-1988.

ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN
BREASTFEEDING

Figure 3 shows trends in the percentage of infants who initiated breastfeeding for the three main ethnic
groups in Peninsular Malaysia—
Malays, Chinese, and Indians, who
comprised about 58, 30, and 10 per
cent of the population, respectively, in
1988. Malays maintained high rates of

any breastfeeding over the entire period examined, with rates exceeding
95 per cent in every year. In contrast,
breastfeeding initiation rates for Chinese and Indians declined substantially
until the mid-1970’s, after which the
sustained decline ceased. Breastfeeding of infants born to Chinese women
fell from well over 70 per cent in the
early 1960’s to only 46 per cent in the
mid-1970’s. Thereafter, the rate fluctuated between 48 and 54 per cent.
Among Indian mothers, the rate of
breastfeeding declined from an average around 90 per cent in the mid1960’s to about 75 per cent in 1974.

 

Since then, the breastfeeding rate
among Indian women has fluctuated
between 72 and 82 per cent and generally increased in the 1980's.

The patterns are similar for the percentage of babies who breastfed for at
least four months (Figure 4). There
was little if any decline among Malays;
over the period considered, around 70
per cent of Malay infants breastfed for
at least four months. Among Chinese
and Indians, rates declined; moreover
these declines were nearly in parallel
since about 1970. For this measure, the
Indian rate ts closer to the Chinese rate
than to the Malay rate. (For the first

measure [ever breastfeeding] the Indian trend line was almost equidistant
between the Malay and Chinese lines.)
By 1986-88, only 18 per cent of Indian
infants and a remarkably low 8 per cent
of Chinese breastfed for at least four
months. The Indian and Chinese percentages in the 1980’s are significantly
lower than those in the 1960's.

Some researchers have noted that
cultural and religious differences may
account for these ethnic differences
in breastfeeding, which remain large
even when other socioeconomic variables associated with ethnicity are controlled (Haaga, 1984). For example, all

Malays are Muslims, and “Islam commands mothers to breastfeed” (Chung
et al., 1991, p. 131). In explaining the
low breastfeeding rate for Chinese,
Chung et al. note: “Chinese have traditionally considered it degrading to
have to breastfeed personally their
babies. Only the poorest mothers in
China used to breast-feed their own
babies; well-to-do mothers almost invariably employed a wet nurse to do
it. Ethnic Chinese throughout Southeast Asia are poor breast-feeders”’
(p. 131). It is interesting that differential use of oral contraception (which
may interfere with lactation) does not

70 DaVanzo et al.

seem to be the reason for ethnic differences in breastfeeding, since both
Malays and Chinese have a high rate
of use of oral contraceptives (DaVanzo
et al., 1989).

Within ethnic groups we do not see
in Figure 3 the same extent of upturn in
the percentage of infants who ever
breastfed as we saw in Figure 1 for the
entire sample, and in Figure 4 we see
no evidence of the increase in the percentage of infants who breastfed for at
least four months that we saw modestly
in Figure 2. This difference can be explained by changes in the ethnic composition of births in Malaysia. Because
fertility rates have declined more for
Chinese and Indians than for Malays
(Hirschman, 1986), the proportion of
all births that are to Malays has increased, from about 45 per cent in
the mid-1960’s to around 65 per cent
in the mid-1980’s. As a result, Malays’
breastfeeding rates exerted an increasing effect on the overall breastfeeding
rate. At the same time, declining
trends in Chinese and Indian breastfeeding rates were attenuating.

EDUCATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN
BREASTFEEDING

Figure 5 shows markedly different
trends in breastfeeding initiation for
women of different educational attainment levels. Among women who had
no formal education or attended only
primary school, the proportion ever
breastfeeding their infants fell from
above 90 per cent in the early 1960's to
just below 80 per cent in 1977, and has
increased somewhat since then, stabilizing at around 85 per cent in recent
years. By contrast, rates of breastfeeding among women with some second
 

Social Biology

ary education increased substantially
over the entire period, from under 60
per cent to nearly 90 per cent.

Before 1980, more educated women
were significantly Jess likely to initiate breastfeeding than their less educated countrywomen; similar negative
associations between education and
breastfeeding had been noted in most
developing countries (e.g., Grant,
1988; Trussell et al., 1992). After 1982,
by contrast, Malaysian women who
had attended secondary school were
significantly more likely to initiate
breastfeedng than those with less education. Chung et al. (1991) report a
similar reversal between “‘poor” and
“well-to-do”’ mothers in Singapore,
Malaysia’s neighbor. This positive association between education and
breastfeeding initiation is consistent
with the pattern that has existed in the
United States since at least the 1960’s
(Starbird, 1991).

These educational trends, together
with the changes in the educational
composition of the sample, contribute
to the overall pattern of decline and
upturn shown in Figure 1. Over the period considered, the proportion of
births occurring to women with at least
some secondary education increased
markedly from only 12 per cent of
the sample in 1967 to 55 per cent by
1986. This increase reflects increases
in educational attainment in Peninsular Malaysia (World Bank, 1990).
Hence, educated women increased
their breastfeeding initiation rates, and
there was an increase in the “weight”
given to those higher rates in defining
the population percentages.

The trends are similar for the percentage of infants who breastfed for at

least four months (Figure 6), though
for this measure the less educated
women have higher rates of breastfeeding throughout the period examined and have experienced a greater increase in the 1980’s than the more
educated women.

DIFFERENCES BY EDUCATION AND
ETHNICITY

Next, we investigate whether these
educational patterns in the rate of
breastfeeding are consistent across ethnic groups in Peninsular Malaysia (Figure 7). For Malay women, there is little
difference in the propensity to initiate

breastfeeding between the two educational groups; a high rate characterizes
both groups in all years considered.
However, when we consider breastfeeding for at least four months (Figure
8), in every year less educated Malay
women are significantly more likely
to have breastfed for four or more
months than more educated women.
The percentage of Malay infants who
breastfed for at least four months generally increased over the period considered for both maternal educational
groups.

The trends in breastfeeding initiation for educational subgroups of Chinese women in Figure 7 are similar to

those seen in Figure 3 for the total sample. Breastfeeding initiation rates declined constantly and precipitously for
Chinese women with less than secondary education until the late 1970's, after which they have been erratic. More
educated Chinese women had very low
rates of breastfeeding initiation in the
early 1970’s (around 30 per cent), but
have shown a steady and rapid increase
in their propensity to initiate breastfeeding since the mid 1970’s. Since
1982, more educated Chinese women
have been more likely to initiate
breastfeeding than Chinese women
with less education. As in the total
sample, the relative increase in the

proportion of Chinese women with secondary education gives this educational group increasing weight through
time. Thus, the arrest of the overall decline in breastfeeding initiation trends
for Chinese women noted in Figure 2
is the net effect of differing trends between the two educational groups.
The percentage of Chinese infants
with less educated mothers who breastfed for at least four months declined in
the 1960’s and 1970’s and remained
fairly constant, at a low level (around
9-10 per cent), in 1980’s (Figure 8).
However, there is no evidence of an increase in this measure for Chinese infants with more educated mothers as

there is for breastfeeding initiation for
this subgroup.

The trends in breastfeeding initiation for educational subgroups of Indian women have been erratic, due in
part to the smaller sample sizes for this
group. The rate generally declined until the early 1980’s for the less educated
group. After 1983, the average breastfeeding rate of the more educated
group was greater than the rate of the
less educated group, though, because
of small sample sizes, the difference is
not statistically significant. Here again,
the increasing proportion of the total
sample that these more educated
women comprised gave them an increasingly greater influence on the
overall trend among all Indian women
shown in Figure 2. However, when we
consider the percentage who breastfed
at least four months, as for the other
two ethnic groups, for Indians also we
see less indication of an increase in the
1980’s in breastfeeding for infants born
to more educated mothers.

DISCUSSION

Retrospective data from MFLS-~1 in
1976, and from the MFLS-2 New sample in 1988 provide independent samples of information on births occurring
in and before 1976. Both datasets show
similar trends for this period of time,
but the data collected in 1988 show
higher average reported breastfeeding
rates. We have compared reports in
1976 and 1988 by the same women (the
Panel sample) about the same pre-1977
births. Although there is an “excellent” degree of agreement between
1976 and 1988 responses about
whether a particular child was breast
 

Social Biology

fed, these data also show lower breastfeeding rates reported in MFLS-1 than
in MFLS-2. For initiation, some of
this difference appears to be due to the
fact that MFLS-1 defined ever breastfeeding (‘‘for a few days’’) more conservatively than did MFLS-2 (‘‘even if
you just tried once or twice’’). The remaining difference for breastfeeding
initiation and the difference for the
percentages breastfeeding for at least
four months may be due to a tendency
for women to underreport previous
breastfeeding if asked at a time when
breastfeeding is less popular and/or to
overreport if asked at a time when it is
more popular.

The MFLS-1 and MFLS-2 data reveal that, following the sustained decline in breastfeeding that began in the
1950’s, there has been a sustained increase since the mid-1970’s in the percentage of babies in Peninsular Malaysia who initiated breastfeeding. We
find that the cessation of the decline in
breastfeeding that Haaga (1986) reported for the MFLS-1 data does indeed seem to represent a long-term
change. We have examined breastfeeding trends for ethnic and educational
subgroups and find that part of the observed change in overall breastfeeding
rates 1S attributable to the changing
composition of the Malaysian population. Over time, the percentages
of births to population subgroups
with higher rates of breastfeeding—
particularly Malays (and more highly
educated women for breastfeeding
initiation) —have increased. However,
there is also evidence of changes 1n women’s rates of breastfeeding within
these subgroups.

The greatest increases in the initiation of breastfeeding occurred for
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

Vol. 41, No. 1-2

women with at least some secondary
education. By contrast, the breastfeeding initiation rate for women with less
than secondary education actually decreased slightly over this period. As a
result, the nature of the educational
differentials reversed. Whereas in the
earlier period less educated women
were considerably more likely to
breastfeed, the opposite was true in the
1980’s. Hence, the women who are
now less likely to initiate breastfeeding
—less educated women, whose infants
are at generally greater risk of illness—
are those whose infants would probably benefit most from doing so.

The reversal in the direction of educational differentials in breastfeeding
initiation in Malaysia produces a pattern similar to that which has prevailed
in the United States for several decades. The turnaround in overall
breastfeeding prevalence began in Malaysia only a few years after a similar
turnaround (from a much lower rate)
in the United States. The Malaysian
experience suggests that the pace of
change in infant feeding practices in
developing countries may be different
from that in Europe and North America; the revival of breastfeeding need
not wait until rates reach the very low
levels that characterized the United
States in the 1960’s and early 1970's.

On the other hand, we do not see a
reversal in educational differences
when we consider the percentage of
babies who breastfed for at least four
months. Among Malaysian women
who initiated breastfeeding, durations
of breastfeeding were shorter for more
educated women than for the less educated throughout the entire period
considered here. While it is recognized
that the WHO recommendations re
 

 

Breastfeeding in Malaysia 75

garding optimal breastfeeding behavior apply to all mothers, regardless of
ethnicity, education, or other characteristic, from a public health viewpoint
there is some encouragement from
the fact that the group which would be
expected to benefit the most from
longer breastfeeding (children of lesseducated mothers) are indeed being
breastfed longer. Nonetheless, the duration of exclusive breastfeeding in
Malaysia falls considerably short of
the WHO recommendation of 4-6
months. In fact, for many subgroups of
the Malaysian population, the duration of any (including supplemented)
breastfeeding is less than the WHO
recommended duration of exclusive
breastfeeding.

In some respects, it is surprising that
there has been an upturn in the rate of
ever-breastfeeding in Malaysia. Many
of the socioeconomic changes in Malaysia over this time period that may
affect women’s breastfeeding decisions
would lead us to expect /ess breastfeeding rather than more. For example,
greater labor market opportunities
for women increase their opportunity
costs of breastfeeding; higher incomes
increase their ability to afford breastmilk substitutes; better water supply
and sanitation and increased availability of health care reduce the need to
breastfeed to shield against health
problems; and a greater availability of
effective contraceptives reduces the
need to breastfeed to postpone the
next birth.

We hypothesize that the increases in
breastfeeding initiation in Malaysia are
not due to reductions in the “‘costs” of
breastfeeding, but rather to increases
in the perceived benefits. Over this period, scientists, policymakers, and the

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

76 DaVanzo et al.

general public have become increasingly aware of the health and nutritional advantages of breastfeeding. We
hypothesize that this information became available to women through the
popular press, through encouragement
by medical personnel and family planning workers, and through the national
breastfeeding campaign, which began
in Malaysia in 1976 (Kandiah, 1992)
and influenced infant feeding decisions. Studies in other countries (e.g.,
Popkin et al., 1991) have suggested
that breastfeeding promotion programs can lead to increases in breastfeeding. The fact that the increase in
breastfeeding initiation rates seen in
the MFLS data is concentrated among
the more educated lends credence to
this information-diffusion hypothesis,
as more educated women would presumably have better access to and
understanding of this information.
However, we see less evidence of this
hypothesis when we consider a minimum duration of exclusive breastfeeding (four months), and we find that
nearly all babies in the data analyzed
here received supplementary food or

Social Biology

drink within a day after birth. These
findings suggest that information about
the length of breastfeeding and the
timing of supplementary feeding is
either not being disseminated and/or
not being incorporated into breastfeeding practices, particularly among
women most likely to have access to
and understanding of this information
(the more educated). Breastfeeding
promotion efforts in Malaysia should
now give more emphasis to the appropriate timing and types of supplementary feeding.
