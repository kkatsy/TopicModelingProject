The Relationship Between Legal Abortion

and Marriage

Unmarried women who became pregnant
prior to 1967 in the United States could
avoid an illegitimate birth by having an
illegal abortion or legitimizing the pregnancy through marriage. Beginning in
1967, legal abortion became a new option
in some states. That many unmarried
women have taken advantage of the less
restrictive policy on abortion is suggested
by research showing that 67 per cent of
legal abortions are performed for unmarried women (Center for Disease Control,
1972) and that there appears to be an
association between legal abortion and declines in illegitimate births (Sklar and
Berkov, 1974; Bauman et al., ms.).

The relationship between legal abortion
and marriage rates has not been studied,
although postponement of marriage could
be an important consequence of the change
in policy on induced abortion. If many
women who become premaritally pregnant
terminate their pregnancies through legal
abortion and as a result delay marriage,
then the marriage rate could decline as a
consequence of Jegal abortions. Two
studies infer that legalized abortion might
cause a postponement of marriage for some

individuals. Sklar and Berkov (1974) reasoned that the decline in the legitimate
birth rate among teenagers in states with
legal abortion between 1970 and 1971
might have been produced by fewer marriages forced by premarital pregnancy.
Bauman, Udry, and Noyes (ms.) studied
the relationship between legalized abortion
and fertility trends in 17 United States’
cities and expected to find a reduction in
legitimate births among high- but not
low-parity women since, among the married, legal abortion-birth ratios were substantially higher among the higher parity
women. However, the reverse was true.
Parity-one legitimate births declined more
in cities with legal abortions than in cities
without legal abortion, and legitimate
birth trends were identical in cities with
and without legal abortions for higher
parity women. From that, they inferred
the high incidence of legal abortions
among the unmarried might have produced
fewer marriages forced by premarital
pregnancy, and hence a decline in parityone legitimate births.

The purpose of this paper is to present
our analysis of the relationship between

legal abortion and trends in the crude
marriage rate among states in the United
States. Our hypothesis is that trends in
marriage rates declined more in states
with large numbers of legal abortions
than in states with relatively few legal
abortions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Abortion-birth ratios (number of legal
abortions to residents per 1,000 live
births) for the second half of 1970 and
for all of 1971 for residents of each state
in the United States were provided by the
Center for Disease Control (see Table 1).
We assume that all states had negligible
legal abortion-birth ratios prior to 1967
and that no state moved from a higher to
lower legal abortion-birth ratio category
during the 1967-71 period. Thus, the
ranking of states according to their legal
abortion-birth ratios in 1970 or 1971 is
an acceptably accurate reflection of each
state’s stability or total increase in legal
abortions between 1967 and 1971. Crude
marriage rates (number of marriages per
1,000 population) for the years 1967
through 1971 are from publications by the
National Center for Health Statistics,
U.S. Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare (1972a, 1974). We excluded
Nevada from the analysis due to the extremely large number of nonresident
marriages.

We would have preferred age-race specific marriage rates and abortion rates
standardized for race and age which included only the unmarried, because they
would allow us to determine more precisely whether abortions to the unmarried
influenced their marriages. The data necessary for those rates are not available. We
assume that the use of more general rates
work against a relationship between legal
abortion and marriages and therefore that

we are making a conservative test of the
hypothesis that legal abortions reduced
marriages. Moreover, it is possible that
some legal abortions considered to have
occurred to residents were actually performed for nonresidents. The extent of
that measurement error is unknown, but
we presume it would also work against the
hypothesis that legal abortions reduced
marriages.

We used two different approaches to
analyze these data: (1) We categorized
states according to four levels of legal
abortion-birth ratios—less than 50, 5099, 100-149, and 150 and higher. Within
these categories, we averaged the crude
marriage rates of the states for each year
1967-71 and compared trends. (2) We
calculated rank-order correlations (Kendall t.) between legal abortion-birth ratios and the differences between crude
marriage rates for each combination of
years 1967-71 for the states. The correlation analysis did not require our establishing cutting points to group states
according to level of legal abortion as was
the case for the first analysis and provides
tests of statistical significance. Both of
these analyses were done using the 1971
legal abortion-birth ratios and were repeated with the 1970 ratios.

RESULTS

The averages of the crude marriage
rates for 1967~71, for the states categorized according to the four levels of
abortion-birth ratios in 1971, are shown
in Figure 1. The states with the lowest
legal abortion-birth ratios exhibited a
linear increase in average crude marriage
rates from 1967 to 1971. In states with
higher legal abortion-birth ratios the
crude marriage rates increased from 196769, with trends generally paralleling the
states with the lowest ratios during that

 

Legal Abortion and Marriage 119

period, but they began to level off in 1970.
The states with the highest abortion-birth
ratios declined more than other states
between 1970 and 1971, Those trends are
consistent with the hypothesis that there
is a relationship between legalized abortion-birth ratios and trends in crude marriage rates among states between 1967
and 1971, in the direction of reduced
crude marriage rates for the states with
the relatively high abortion-birth ratios.
We repeat the analysis in Figure 2, but
this time we use the 1970 legalized
abortion-birth ratio rather than the 1971
ratio for categorizing states. The same
conclusion is derived.

Some discussion is in order prior to presenting our second analysis. Now that we
have seen an association between legalized
abortion and the crude marriage rate, we
were not surprised to see it appear toward
the end of the 1967-71 period rather than
earlier. Although 1967 was the first year
that a few states enacted a less restrictive
policy on induced abortion, we expected
some lag between enactment and implementation of the policy; and many of the
states with high legal abortion-birth ratios in 1970 and 1971 did not achieve
those levels until closer to the end of the
five-year period, since they enacted policies after 1967. One final comment on our
findings. It is of interest to note that the
crude marriage rate for the United States
exhibited an increasing trend from 1959
to 1970, and in 1971 and 1972 began
levelling off (U.S. Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, 19725). Although there could be numerous explanations for that change in trend, the preceding analyses suggest one hypothesis
should be that it might be in part attributable to the change in policy on induced
abortion.

In our second analysis, we hypothesize
that the ranks of states on legal abortionDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

with ranks of states on changes in the
crude marriage rates. Having already seen
the trend analysis presented above, we
expected to see the correlations appear for
the later but not earlier years during the
1967-71 period. The correlations were sig

predicted direction, when associating the
ranks of the 1971 abortion-birth ratio
with the ranks of the differences between
the crude marriage rate in 1971 and the

data are consistent with the hypothesis
that there is a relationship between implementation of a less restrictive abortion

analyses. Different denominators might
yield different conclusions. Therefore, we
calculated different measures to rank
states on legal abortions by retaining the
number of legal abortions for the numerators and substituting the following for
the numbers of births in the denominators: (1) the number of women age 1544; (2) the number of single women age
15-44; and (3) the number of legal abortions plus number: of live births. The
rank-order correlations for the relationships of each of these measures with the
differences in marriage rates between 1971
and each year 1967-70 are shown in Table
4, along with the comparable correlations
derived when using the 1971 legal abortion-birth ratios. The results using the
different ratios and rates are virtually
identical. As was the case in Tables 2 and

Social Biology

3, none of the correlations of these different legal abortion measures with differences in marriage rates prior to 1971
were statistically significant (not shown).
We conclude that all rates and ratios we
used to rank states on legal abortions produced the same results when correlated
with the ranks of differences in marriage
rates.

Although we demonstrated an association between legalized abortion and crude
marriage rates, we cannot be certain it is
a causal relationship. One reason for our
uncertainty is that both legalized abortion
and marriage rate trends might be related
to a common variable which produced a
spurious association. For example, major
federal support for family planning services
began early in the 1967-71 period. If many
recipients of those services were unmarried, their participation might have reduced forced marriages. A_ correlation
between the state’s abortion-birth ratios
and use of family planning services by the
unmarried could have produced the association between legal abortion and trends
in the crude marriage rate. Or, perhaps
the unmarried are increasingly finding
such substitutes for early marriage as
professional careers and find the social
milieu of states with legal abortions more
conducive to delaying early marriage to

pursue professional careers than that of
states without legal abortions, and that,
rather than a decline in marriages forced
by premarital pregnancy, explains the
relationships we observed above. Data
are not available for testing these possibilities.

In addition to the analyses presented
thus far, we derived crude estimates of
how many marriages might have been
delayed by legalized abortion. Such estimates not only provide a measure of the
magnitude of the relationship between
legalized abortion and marriage rates, but
evidence as to whether we can infer there
is a causal relationship. For example, if
our estimates revealed there were many
more marriages delayed by legalized abortions than there were legal abortions, we
might not be able to infer from our earlier
analyses that there was a causal relationship between legal abortions and marriage
rates. If our estimates suggested that each
legal abortion delayed a marriage, we
would also suspect the value of our earlier
analysis for inferring causation, since we
find it difficult to imagine that ratio would
be so low since the ratio of legal abortions
to live births prevented is not that low
(Bauman et al., ms.).

We estimated the number of marriages
delayed for at least one year by the following procedure. (1) We estimated how
many marriages would have occurred in
the states with abortion-birth ratios of 150
or more in 1971 if the 1970-71 trend in
the crude marriage rate for those states
had paralleled the trend for the states with
abortion-birth ratios less than 50. The result was 577,678 marriages. (2) That
number Jess the actual number of marriages in states with abortion-birth ratios
of 150 or more in 1971 (558,545 actual
marriages) yields our estimate of the number of marriages delayed for at least one
year by abortions: 19,133. We then esti

mated the total number of legal abortions
performed for the unmarried in residents
of the states with abortion-birth ratios 150
and higher by multiplying the total number of legal abortions to residents of those
states (293,549) by the proportion of
legalized abortions performed for the unmarried among those states that provide
information on marital status (p = 0.67).

This procedure yielded the estimate
there were 196,678 legal abortions performed on the unmarried in the states
with abortion-birth ratios of 150 or higher,
which gives us a ratio of 10 legal abortions
to the unmarried per delayed marriage
(196,678 -—- 19,133 = 10). We repeated
the analyses, except we substituted the
states with abortion-birth ratios of 50-99
for those with abortion-birth ratios less
than 50 to estimate what the trend in
crude marriage rates would have been in
the states with the highest abortion-birth
ratios in absence of legal abortion. This
procedure yielded the estimate that every
9 legal abortions to the unmarried delayed one marriage one year. Of course,
these estimates are crude. However, the
ratios appear realistic and not inconsistent
with the hypothesis that there is a causal
relationship between legalized abortions
among the unmarried and marriage.

Our estimates of marriages postponed
per legal abortion might be underestimates
because, as discussed above, the rates we
used in our analysis are general, and rates
specific to race, age, parity, and marital
status might have produced sharper differences in marriage trends for states with
different numbers of legal abortions. Moreover, it is possible that data after 1971
will show greater differences in marriages
between states with varying levels of legal
abortions if many legal abortions are now
replacements for what would have been
illegal abortions, and the number of legal
abortions eventually begin to outpace the

number of illegal abortions that might
have occurred.

SUMMARY

We hypothesized a relationship between
legal abortion-birth ratios and crude marriage rate trends among states in the
United States. Our rationale was that
many legal abortions are performed for
the unmarried; thus legal abortion might
be preventing marriages forced by premarital pregnancy. Our analyses suggested
that there was an association between legal abortion and changes among crude
marriage rates for the states with the
highest abortion-birth ratios. Our crude
estimates suggested that, if there is a causal relationship, it takes 9-10 legal abortions for the unmarried to delay a marriage
one year. Put another way, about one abortion in ten delays a marriage if all the

Social Biology

decline in marriage rates is due to increases in abortions and if no legal abortions are replacements for previously
illegal abortions.

The results were obtained using general
measures for the variables, and more refined measures which account for race,
age, parity, and marital status might produce stronger relationships between legalized abortion and marriage trends than
we observed here. We believe this analysis
justifies a more refined analysis when the
data become available.
