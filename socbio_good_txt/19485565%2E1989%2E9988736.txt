A Regression Approach
to the Projection of U.S. Fertility
Based on Past Fertility Data

ABSTRACT: The method of fertility projection used by the U.S. Bureau of the Census involves
assumptions about the ultimate cohort total fertility rate and the ultimate cohort mean age at
childbearing based on recent levels of fertility and women’s birth expectations. This paper
provides an outline of a general regression approach to fertility projection based on past data
which would generate these two ultimate cohort characteristics. The technique is illustrated by
using the U.S. single-year age-specific fertility rates up to 1986 for total women and projecting
them indefinitely into the future until they become stable for both calendar years and cohorts.

For the past twenty-five years, the basic steps involved in the projection of
fertility by the U.S. Bureau of the Census have been as follows: (1) assume an
ultimate cohort total fertility rate consistent with recent levels of fertility, women’s expectations of future births, and
social and economic trends that affect
fertility; (2) assume an ultimate cohort
mean age at childbearing consistent with
the assumption in Step 1; (3) generate a
set of ultimate age-specific fertility rates
by studying the past shapes of the cohort
fertility schedules which is consistent
with assumptions in Steps 1 and 2; and,
finally, (4) obtain the age-specific fertility rates between the base year and the
year when they are assumed to have
reached stability by interpolation and
other means to make sure that the generated fertility schedules maintain unimodal shapes and converge smoothly to
the ultimate values for both periods and
cohorts.

In its recent published report on projection, the Census Bureau assumed ultimate cohort total fertility rates of 1.5,
1.8, and 2.2 per woman for the low, middle, and high series, respectively, and an
ultimate cohort mean age at childbearing of 26.92 for all three series (Bureau
of the Census, 1989, p. 23). Although
the total fertility rate rose to as high as
3.7 in 1957, it has been under two children since 1972. Therefore, any value of
ultimate fertility outside the range of 1.7
to 2.1 would hardly be acceptable to demographers at the present time. The assumption of an ultimate cohort mean
age at childbearing consistent with the
ultimate cohort total fertility rate has
never been easy for the Census Bureau
because of an apparently unclear relationship between these two variables.
Over time, they are sometimes positively (e.g., 1957-1964, 1982-1990) and
sometimes negatively (e.g., 1964-1982)
correlated (compare the dashed curves

in Figures 1 and 2). The problems with
the precise assumptions about the ultimate total fertility and the ultimate
mean age at childbearing call for the investigation of alternative approaches
that might produce such values based on

past data and not provide them exogenously.

tility rates for successive years, and
hence the ultimate total fertility and the
ultimate mean age, are obtained from
the estimated regression equations by
repeated applications of them with new
sets of values for the independent variables as the projection proceeds. The
technique is illustrated by using the U.S.
single-year age-specific fertility rates up
to 1986 for total women and projecting
them indefinitely into the future until
they become stable for both calendar
years and cohorts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The method of projection proposed
in this paper is a multiple linear regression technique, where the fertility rate
In an age is the dependent variable, and
the independent variables are one or
more variables created from the past
age-specific fertility rates.

For the purpose of illustration, we
choose three independent variables
which can represent, in a very crude
sense, the age, period, and cohort effects in fertility (Hobcraft et al., 1982).
Fach of the 36 equations for the 36 ages
14,15,... , 49 has the general form

AX, = A + BoX. + B3X3 + BX, (1)

where the dependent variable X; is the
fertility rate at age a in year t, and the independent variables X2, X3, and_X, are,
respectively, the total fertility rate in
year t— 1 (period effect), the cumulative fertility of the cohort in the preceding ten years (cohort effect), and the
sum of six fertility rates, viz., those at
ages a— 1, a, and a + 1 in years t— 1
and t — 2 (age effect).

While the period effect X2 is an objectively defined variable, subjective elements are involved in the definitions of
X;3 and X,. The fertility of a woman at

 

Das Gupta

Social Biology

age 32, for example, is expected to depend more on her cumulative fertility in
the preceding few years rather than on
her fertility at age 31 or on her life-time
fertility up to age 31. However, there is
no obvious reason why this cumulation
should be done over the preceding ten
years (and not, say, over the preceding
nine or eleven years). This problem in
the definition of the cohort effect X3
may be resolved easily by computing the
actual correlation coefficients between
X, and X3 (eliminating the effects of Xz
and X,) corresponding to various possible cumulation periods. Again, the fertility rate at the same age a in the preceding year t — 1 may be a good choice for
the age effect X, on theoretical grounds.
However, the error in this individual
rate relative to the rates at other ages
around it and at other years preceding it
calls for the use of several rates centered
at age a in the definition of X,. The use
of six rates that we have chosen is just
one such possibility. We should emphasize that the names given to the effects of
the variables X2, X3, and X4 as period,
cohort, and age effects may not be
purely scientific; but no matter how we
describe them, the real test for the variables lies in how acceptable they are in
terms of the correlations and the goodness of fit of the regression equations.
The single-year central birth rates in
ages 14 through 49 for all women from
1917 through 1986 are available from
Heuser (1976) and from the National
Center for Health Statistics (published
and unpublished). The period total fertility rates fluctuated relatively smoothly
over time starting from the late 1940’s
(Figure 1). We, therefore, discarded the
data for the earlier years. In order to test
the sensitivity of the method to the beginning and end of the years of data
used, we obtained nine sets of projec

tions with the corresponding ultimate
cohort total fertility rates and mean ages
at childbearing as shown in Table 1.
Since the numbers in Table 1 are virtually identical for all nine sets, the detailed results are shown only for one of
the sets, viz., when the data used are
from 1949 through 1986.

RESULTS

Since the independent variable X3 involves the fertility rates in the preceding
ten years, the data for 38 years (19491986) provide 28 sets of values of (X;,
X2, X3, X4) for fitting the 36 regression
equations for ages 14 through 49. In
computing the variables X3 and X,4, it is
assumed that the fertility rate in any age
outside the childbearing ages 14-19 is
zero (for example, X3 = Ofora = 14,so
there is no cohort effect in the regression
equation for age 14). Obviously, for
fitting the regressions for earlier ages,
more than 28 data points (X1, X2, X3,
X4) are available from the fertility rates
for 38 years 1949-1986. However, for
the sake of uniformity, 28 points are
used for all 36 regressions.

Table 2 gives the correlation and regression coefficients for the 36 regression equations. The high absolute values
of riz, 713, and 714 suggest that, throughout the reproductive span, the dependent variable is highly correlated with

each of the three independent variables.
Relatively high absolute values in genera) of the partial correlation coefficients 712.34, 713.24, and 714,23 also suggest
that each of the independent variables is
contributing significantly to the regression equations. The values of 1234 are
mostly positive which means that higher
(lower) values of the total fertility rate in
the preceding year tend to make the current fertility rates in most ages higher
(lower). This positive period effect is
more evident in the peak reproductive
ages 20-31. The exclusive cohort effects, as revealed by the values of 713.24,
change from positive to negative somewhere around age 23.

In other words, when fertility passes
the peak age, the effect of the cumulative cohort fertility in the preceding ten
yeas on the current fertility, uninfluenced by the period and age effects,
would be negative, although the corresponding rj3 is positive. This negative cohort effect is more predominant in the
ages 27-38. The pattern of the age effect, as indicated by the values of 714.23, is
somewhat opposite to that of the cohort
effect. When the period and cohort effects are eliminated from the data, the
age effect is negative in the twenties (although ry, is highly positive), and then
turns positive for the rest of the reproductive ages. The concentration of the
relatively high positive age effect is in

the ages 32—44. The multiple correlation
coefficients R;.234, which may be regarded as the overall measures of the
goodness of fit, are extremely high for
all 36 regression equations. The last four
columns of Table 2 give the coefficients
of the 36 regression equations in (1).
Table 3 gives the observed agespecific fertility rates for the years 19501986 and the projected rates for the
years 1987-2200. It also shows the corresponding total fertility rates and mean
ages at childbearing for both periods
and cohorts. The projected rate X; for
1987 at age 31, for example, is obtained
from Equation 1 and Tables 2 and 3 as

X, = 0.0233 + (0.0246 x 1.8388) —
(0.0259 x 1.1085) + (0.0842 x
0.4764) = 0.0799.

The same regression equations are used
without change for projections of the
fertility rates successively for 1987,
1988, etc., each time first computing the
new sets of values for the independent
variables X>, X3, and X%.

The stability of the total fertility rates
for both periods and cohorts (correct to
four decimal places) is reached in the
year 2155 at the level 2.0028. The stability of the mean ages at childbearing both
ways (correct to two decimal places) is
reached much earlier, in the year 2085,
at the level 26.27. The fertility rates in
individual ages reach stability at different points in time.

The results are shown diagrammatically in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 gives
the total fertility rates for periods and
cohorts for the years 1930-2030. It
shows how the period and cohort rates,
starting at very different values in 1986
(1.8388 and 3.0346, respectively), come
very close to each other (at values
1.9994 and 2.0538) in 2030, and eventually converge to the common value of

2.0028 in 2155 (not shown in Figure 1).
The cohort total fertility rate, starting
with a peak value of 3.2200 in 1982,
smoothly declines to a trough of 1.9339
in 2007, then slowly rises to a value of
2.0884 in 2023, and finally comes down
to stabilize at the value 2.0028. On the
other hand, the period total fertility rate
continually rises from the 1986 base year
rate of 1.8388 to a value of 2.1497 in
1999 and then falls to settle eventually at
2.0028. As expected, the cohort curve is
much smoother than the period curve.

Figure 2 shows the mean ages at
childbearing for periods and cohorts for
the years 1930-2030. From the base
year value of 24.99 in 1986, the cohort
mean age continues to decline to reach a
bottom at 24.65 in 1990 and then rises
monotonically to a peak value of 26.65
in 2012. After damped oscillations, the
mean age finally stabilizes at 26.27. By
contrast, the period mean age at childbearing rises slightly from the base year
value of 26.37 in 1986 to a peak value of
26.43 in 1996 to finally converge to a stable value of 26.27.

DISCUSSION

Although demographers may find
the present results acceptable, the main
thrust of the paper is not the results but
rather providing a sketch of an alternative approach to fertility projection that
would make more use of past data in a
relatively objective way. More research
is needed to decide how many independent variables should be used in the multiple linear regressions and what should
be their precise definitions.

The characterization of the three independent variables in this paper as the
age, period, and cohort effects is arguable. A more important consideration,
however, is to make sure that the fittings

of the regression equations are satisfactory and that each of the independent
variables contributes significantly to
these fittings.

A prudent choice of the variables in
the multiple regressions should lead to
convergence of the age-specific fertility
rates to some stable values, although
this cannot be proved mathematically.

in mind that we would like to see as the
ultimate total fertility rate, that number
can be generated, at least approximately, by varying the number of years
of data as our input. This opens up the
possibility of providing three sets of projections (low, middle, and high), as does
the Census Bureau, by using past data
for three different lengths of the period
