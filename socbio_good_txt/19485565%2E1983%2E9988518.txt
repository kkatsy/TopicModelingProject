ity, from increases in mortality, or from
quantitative differences in the magnitude of male and female rates both moving in the same direction? These three
basic questions, phrased somewhat
more obliquely, were addressed by Enterline (1961) in his analysis of trends in
American mortality from 1920 to 1958.
The purpose of the present paper is to
provide more contemporary answers to
these three questions, using Enterline’s
approach and drawing on data from the
United States for 1963 and 1976.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ASSESSING SEX DIFFERENCES IN
MORTALITY

The first step in examining mortality
differentials is simply to look at crude
death rates in a given population over
time. In 1963, among the white population of the United States, the death rate
per 100,000 was 921.1 for men, compared with 546.0 for women. The sex
mortality ratio was therefore 1.69. By
1976, the rates for men and women were
798.8 and 439.6 respectively, with a consequent increase in the sex ratio to 1.82.

Since mortality varies importantly
with age, it is also necessary to assess Sex
mortality ratios using age-specific data.
When this is done, two generalizations
emerge. First, it is apparent that, other
things being equal, sex mortality ratios
are lowest at the extremes of the life cycle, among the very young and the very
old. Second, when one examines
changes over time, it is apparent that not
all age groups contribute equally to the
increasing mortality differential. From
1963 to 1976, the sex ratio increased by
13 per cent. For the purposes of analysis, we will examine the three age categories which showed the highest degree

of change: youths and adolescents aged
15-24 (39 per cent); young adults aged
25~34 (36 per cent) and old persons (22
per cent). Among babies and among
persons in late middle age, there is actually a slight reversal of the dominant
trend (Table 1).

The observation of a sex mortality
differential by age immediately suggests
a discrepancy in cause of death. It is to
be expected that the old and the young
die of different causes. What contribution to the whole change in the death
rate is made by any one cause of death?
The answer to this question must take
into account not only the rate of changes
in death rates by cause of death, but also
the importance of each cause of death in
contributing to deaths in toto.

Calculations of the relative contribution to change made by specific causes of
death are based on the formula used by
Enterline (1961, p. 316):

Estimates. . . are based upon the derivative of the ratio of male to female death
rates (calculus):

It should be noted that for long time intervals, such as are being considered
here, this formula: “. . . is approximate, and contributions by individual
causes do not add exactly to the total increment in the sex mortality ratio” (Enterline, 1961, p. 316).

The proportionate contribution of
various causes of death in the three
groups showing the most marked
change are given in Tables 2, 3 and 4,
based on causes of death which accounted for at least 2.5 per cent of the
total deaths in each age group.! The
changes occurring in each age group are
described and discussed separately.

RESULTS

MorTALITY DIFFERENTIALS AMONG
YOUTHS

In the forty-year span examined by
Enterline, the largest increases in mortality differentials were found among
young persons 15-24, among whom the
sex ratio increased from 1.16 in 1929-31,
to 2.65 in 1956-58 (Enterline, 1961, p.
315). In the period subject to our attention, 1963 to 1976, the sex ratio again increased markedly, from 2.52 to 2.91,
with the result that the death rate for
young men is nearly three times that of
young women (Table 1).

The relative contributions of various
causes of death to changing sex ratios
among young persons are presented in
Table 2. The most obvious of these is the
decline in maternal mortality among
young women, which accounts for 17.43

‘In assessing changes over time, an inevitable
problem is the variation in the available statistics.
A certain lack of comparability exists in the data
presented due to the revision of the classification of
causes of death. The data for 1963 were based on
the Seventh Revision of the Internationa! List of
Causes; for 1976, on the Eighth Revision.

per cent of the change. Both sexes
showed declines in deaths due to cardiovascular disease and malignant neoplasms, but these were more marked for
young women than for young men.

The most important changes relate to
violent deaths. Although homicide
deaths are generally rare, they increased
disproportionately among males. More
important was the increase in male suicide, which alone accounts for almost
one quarter (23.44 per cent) of the variance. Counterbalancing these trends to
some extent was the increase in accidental deaths among women. Although
mortality from motor vehicle accidents
increases for both sexes, it increased
proportionately more for women, as did
other accidents.

MORTALITY DIFFERENTIALS AMONG
YounG ADULTS

From 1963 to 1976, the sex mortality
ratio in the age group 25-34 increased
from 1.94 to 2.30, an increment (36 per
cent) almost as large as that among
youths. The causes of death responsible
for this change, and their relative contributions, are given in Table 3. The pattern is similar to that of younger persons, but is not identical. Since women
in this age group are more involved in
childbearing than their younger counterparts, it is not surprising that the largest factor (19.61 per cent) is due to the
reduction in maternal mortality. Falling
rates due to cardiovascular disease
showed greater gains for women, as did
those for malignancies, accounting respectively for 15.5 per cent and 9.45 per
cent of the observed change. As with
younger persons, suicide continued to
increase and to increase disproportionately for males, but the discrepancies
were not as great and accounted for only
16.09 per cent of the change. Rates of

homicide are lower than for suicide, but
they are higher among young adults
than among youths. The rates for
women increased only slightly, but
those for males nearly doubled, thereby
accounting for 14.90 per cent of the
change. Counterbalancing these advantages for women were changes in their
involvement in accidents. In contrast to
younger persons, mortality among
young adults due to automobile accidents declined, but more so for males
than for females. Involvement in other
accidents rose slightly, but proportionately more so for women.

MORTALITY DIFFERENTIALS IN
SENESCENCE

The mortality rates of middle-aged
persons have made relatively slight contributions to the overall change in sex ratios. However, after the age of 65, relatively large changes again occur. For
example, if we look at persons 75-84,
we find that the ratio increased from
1.38 in 1963 to 1.60 in 1976, an increment of 22 per cent (Table 1). The
causes of death associated with this
change are different from those most
important for younger persons, in that
maternal mortality and violent deaths
are no longer major concerns (Table 4).
For almost all major causes of death
among senescent populations, death
rates in 1976 are lower than they were in
1963, reflecting improvements in medical technology and in access to medical
resources. However, the improvements
which are manifest have more impact on
women’s rates than they do on men’s.
For example, male deaths due to stroke
fell from a rate of 1,482.8 in 1963 to a
rate of 1,094.4 in 1976. During the same
period, rates for women changed from
1,358.4 to only 953.6, an accelerated de

cline which accounts for 14.55 per cent
of the total variation. The only exception to this generalization is in deaths
due to malignant neoplasms, which
have systematically increased. Women’s
mortality due to malignancies is not increasing as rapidly as is men’s, but it is
increasing among old persons.

DISCUSSION

Returning to our initial questions, it
is clear that the age groups which contribute most to the changing sex mortality ratios are very young and very old
adults. In response to the question of
whether these ratios are due to biological or to social factors, it is suggested
that quite different answers pertain to
these two groups. In the past among
young adults, major factors contributing
to the demise of young women were the
perils associated with pregnancy and
childbearing. During the last several
decades, control of these hazards has
significantly improved women’s life
chances. However, since maternal mortality is now very low, and since the general decline in average family size places
women at less and less risk, 1t seems unlikely that this factor will continue to be
a major component in future changes.
Excluding dangers from reproduction,
young women seem to have a clear biological advantage over young men and
thus achieve greater gains from fewer
deaths due to cancer and heart disease.
However, these degenerative diseases
are not major killers among the young.
The prognosis in terms of violent
deaths, however, is somewhat different.

Among young persons, the largest
single cause of death is motor vehicle accidents. The rates for men are much
larger than for women. In 1961, Enterline reported that deaths due to motor vehicle accidents made an important

contribution in the widening of the sex
mortality differential at the young ages.
Since that time, however, the trend has
been reversed, and motor fatalities now
serve to narrow the gap in mortality
level by sex. Changes in gender roles
have made driving less exclusively a
male activity. More women are now
learning to drive, and among women in
their thirties the proportion licensed is
_2Pproximately equal to that among men
a(Veevers, 1982, p. 173). Although
‘women are driving greater distances
Sthan they did, they still drive only about
ohalf as many miles as men do. ControlAling for miles driven, they do not have
comore accidents than do men, and are
aless likely to have fatal accidents
ca(Veevers, 1982, p. 175). Nevertheless,
as women take to the roads, their mor‘gtality from accidents increases. In 1963,
othe sex ratios for traffic accident mortal“Sity among persons 15-24 and 25-34 were
23. 62 and 4.02 respectively; by 1976,
‘Sthese ratios had declined to 3.23 and
+=3.64 (Tables 2 and 3).
5 In addition to fatal motor vehicle ac‘<cidents, men are consistently more in—volved in other fatal accidents than are
women. In 1963, among youths, the raU,- .
2tio of male accidental death rates to feSmale rates was 6.27; among young
Fadults it was 6.08. By 1976, these ratios
Awere reduced to 5.27 and 5.45 respectively, a significant reduction but one
still leaving a substantial discrepancy between the risks to men and to women.
Presumably these circumstances relate
directly to the aggressive and risk-taking
components of the male role. As gender
roles begin to change in many areas of
life, including attitudes towards dangerous activities, will women’s involvement
in accidents continue to increase? More
systematic research is needed on the relationship of gender role expectations to

accidental deaths, especially those
among young people.

Two other forms of violent deaths,
suicide and homicide, both show increasing rates among young persons.
Although male rates are increasing
faster than female rates, it is noteworthy
that more young women are involved in
these forms of violence. In summary,
among young persons, the widening gap
in sex mortality ratios seems (with the
exception of maternal mortality) to be
due mostly to social factors which relate,
in as yet unspecified ways, to the propensity to be involved in violent death.

Among older persons, there is clear
evidence that the medical advances
which benefit the old have had a more
salutory effect for women than they
have had for men. For all causes of
death, except malignant neoplasms, the
death rates for both sexes declined.
However, they declined more precipitously for women than for men, suggesting support for the hypothesis that
women simply have a relatively superior
constitution. The increase in malignant
neoplasms among the total population is
in part due to the increase of carcinogenic agents in the environment, a circumstance which affects everyone but
which women may be able to resist more
effectively.

Part of the discrepancy between male
and female cancer deaths is due to the
marked success which has been experienced in detecting and in treating uterine cancer, thereby reducing a major
hazard for women which has not been
paralleled by men. In 1963, the sex ratio
in the death rate due to cancer of the
genitals was 1.25; by 1976, the ratio was
2.1.

A major source in the discrepancy of
mortality rates appears to be related to
the use of tobacco, especially as it perDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

tains to respiratory cancer, and to other
associated pathologies such as cardiovascular disease (Waldron, 1976). Retherford (1975) estimates that approximately 75 per cent of the increase in the
male-female differential in life expectancy (between the ages of 37 and 87)
over the period from 1910 to 1962 can be
accounted for by the effects of smoking.
Traditionally, American society has accepted cigarette smoking for men and
discouraged it for women. While smoking has never been culturally prescribed
as part of the male gender role, the differential use of cigarettes by men and
women is, nevertheless, related to our
system of gender roles with its resulting
double standard. Older women in 1976
enjoyed a mortality rate favorable, to
that of older men in part because most
of them had not smoked or had not
smoked heavily. However, the proportion of young women who smoke cigarettes has increased in recent years
(U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1976; U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1978), and as this occurs it
seems likely that the rates of tobaccorelated pathologies of women will increase as women who smoke reach midlife.

IMPLICATIONS

The male role includes many aspects
which, if not exactly “lethal,” are at
least potentially dangerous to one’s
health (Jourard, 1974). The emphasis
on being strong may lead men to interpret signs of illness as signs of weakness
and therefore to suppress or to ignore
them as long as possible, rather than
making an immediate effort to seek
help. The discouragement of selfdisclosure, together with an emphasis
on the pursuit of instrumental goals at

the expense of emotional ones, may
lead to undue levels of stress, some of
which may lead to suicidal tendencies
(Jourard, 1974). The privileged enjoyment of tobacco and of alcohol carry
with it well-known health hazards to
lungs and liver. In addition, what David
and Brannon (1976) call the “Give ’em
Hell” dimension of the male sex role
guides men to present a self which contains an aura of aggression, violence,
and daring. The resulting proclivity for
violent death is especially manifest
among young men.

If the male role is indeed dangerous
to one’s health, it is not as dangerous as
it used to be. Except for young men in
their prime “Give ’em Hell” years, male
death rates have systematically declined
at all ages. If society is becoming more
androgynous, as many persons contend
that it is, it may be that some men are
becoming more feminine in their behaviors and outlook. However, the move
toward androgynous behavior is less
likely to involve men becoming more
feminine than it is to involve women becoming more masculine. Changing gender expectations emphasize the ways in
which women can come to act like men
more than the alternative of men coming to act more like women. In health
terms, this may well constitute a significant factor in changes in the sex mortality ratios. It seems unlikely that female death rates will ever exceed or
even equal male death rates, at least in
the forseeable future. However, it is
possible that the biological advantage
enjoyed by women may be substantially
modified if they do indeed come to act in
more masculine ways and to enjoy masculine privilege in terms of smoking,
drinking, driving, and other forms of
risk taking. Analysis of mortality of
