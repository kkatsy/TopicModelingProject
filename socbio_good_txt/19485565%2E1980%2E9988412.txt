Altitude and Fertility: The Confounding Effect
of Childhood Mortality—A Bolivian Example

ABSTRACT: Demographic studies undertaken in several Andean countries have found that women residing at high altitudes have significantly fewer live births than do their low altitude counterparts. This
reduction has been explained as being due to various factors: the debilitating effects of hypoxia upon the
reproductive system; the effects of sociocultural factors which vary with altitude and which affect reproductive behavior; and errors in data collection. In order to examine the validity of some of these hypotheses, the fertility of a group of 906 Bolivian women residing at low, medium, and high altitudes was
examined. The women were selected from the lower socioeconomic strata and reported never having
used any method of contraception. A detailed analysis of the fertility of these women showed no
significant altitude-related differences in the number of live births. However, as a result of significantly
higher childhood mortality rates at altitude, there was a significant reduction in numbers of living
children. The results of this study suggest that the collection and analysis of census data that ignores
socioeconomic differences within a population or differences among census units in neonatal or early
childhood mortality may bias or complicate the study of the impact of altitude on human fertility. Although the present research does not prove that hypoxic stress does not affect the reproductive system,
the results suggest that if altitude does reduce fecundity, the reduction is not great and is likely to be

shown only through studies of reproductive physiology.

During the past two decades researchers analyzing census data from several Andean countries have reported that women
residing at altitudes over 3,000 meters
have significantly fewer offspring than do
women living at sea level. These findings
have been supported by the results of
several detailed demographic studies of
specific Andean communities. A variety
of hypotheses have been put forward to
explain these fertility differentials. As
there is evidence that the hypoxic stress
associated with altitude affects various aspects of reproductive physiology (Clegg
and Harrison, 1971; Clegg, 1978), some
researchers have suggested that the lower
fertility found among highland women isa
direct effect of residing at altitude. However, there are also data indicating that infant mortality is increased at altitude, and

it has been suggested that the relatively
crude estimates of fertility available from
census data do not take into account the
mortality differences. Other researchers
feel that the fertility differentials are related to sociocultural factors which vary
with altitude.

It is the purpose of the present study to
investigate further the relationship between altitude and human fertility by analyzing the fertility of a large sample of Bolivian women. In particular, the effects of
sociocultural variation and differential
early childhood mortality are examined.

BACKGROUND

Ever since the Spanish arrived in the
Andes in the sixteenth century there have
been reports that fertility was reduced at

101

102 Dutt

high altitude. As early as the 1630’s the
Spanish reported having difficulties in
producing offspring in Potosi, a mining
community located at an altitude of more
than 14,000 feet. At the same time the native population did not appear to suffer
any such reduction (de la Calancha, 1639,
quoted in Monge, 1948). On the basis of
such historical reports and folklore concerning altitude and human fertility,
Monge (1948) analyzed data from the
1940 Peruvian national census and found
that highland women did report fewer offspring than women living at lower altitudes. Subsequently, a number of investigators have analyzed census data from
several Andean countries and have reported altitude-related fertility differentials.

Information on fertility is also available
from demographic studies of several Andean communities: Cruz-Coke and his
colleagues (Cruz-Coke et al., 1966; CruzCoke, 1967) have studied five Aymara
communities in an environmental gradient from high to low altitude in northern
Chile; Baker and his coworkers (Hoff,
1968; Baker and Dutt, 1972; Way, 1972)
have made detailed studies of the fertility
of women residing in a highland community in southern Peru; and Abelson et al.
(1974) have examined the fertility of
highland natives who have migrated to a
low altitude valley located on the southern
Peruvian coast. These studies generally
support the concept of a smaller completed family size among highland natives
as compared to lowland natives.

A variety of explanations have been offered for these observations, and they can
be summarized as follows:

1. Highland women have fewer offspring due to the direct effect of hypoxic
stress upon the reproductive system reducing fecundity, i.e., reproductive potential
(James, 1966; Abelson et al., 1974; Baker
and Dutt, 1972).

Social Biology

2. The smaller numbers of offspring reported by high altitude women are the result of increased infant and early childhood
mortality at high altitude (Whitehead,
1968). In a number of cases fertility has
been measured using data on number of living children; differences in mortality will
bias such estimates.

3. The differences in number of live
births are related to sociocultural factors
which vary with altitude. For example, Stycos (1963) suggests that the differentials are
due to increased marital instability among
the rural highland Indian population. Heer
(1964) indicates that the differences between the high and low altitude population
in terms of the adult sex ratio and the proportion of working women are the primary
factors responsible for the fertility differentials.

4. The reduced fertility levels found at
high altitude are artifacts of the methods by
which the census data were collected. Bradshaw (1969) reports evidence indicating
substantial underenumeration in the primarily Indian highland areas.

Due to a variety of methodological
problems associated with the past research, it is difficult to evaluate these hypotheses. The census data allow the use of
only crude measures of fertility. In many
instances the child/woman ratio, the number of living children less than 5 years of
age in a census unit divided by the total
number of women ages 15 to 45 in that
unit, has commonly been used. Such an
estimate can be biased by differential mortality or migration. Furthermore, since
the census data are of an aggregate nature,
it is difficult to control for the effects of a
variety of social factors which also vary
with altitude. The detailed community
studies do permit a more precise measurement of reproductive performance and allow the simultaneous consideration of
many related variables. However, due to
the relatively small sample sizes, the limited number of communities studied, and
the lack of comparable data on low alltitude communities, it is difficult to deter

mine whether the findings are representative of the larger population. De Jong
(1970) indicates that the relative contributions of sociocultural factors and altitude
to fertility remain unclear.

Recently, as part of a study of the sociocultural foundations of fertility in Bolivia, detailed sociocultural information
and complete fertility histories were collected from a large sample of women who
resided at altitudes ranging from 500 to
more than 4,000 meters. In addition to the
sociocultural data, information was also
gathered on contraceptive usage and
whether the offspring were alive at the
time of the interview. The fact that the
same questionnaire and survey methods
were used to gather information on the
fertility of women residing at low, medium, and high altitudes and the nature of
the data gathered made this an appropriate sample for the further study of the relationship between altitude and fertility.
The detailed fertility histories permit precise measurement of fertility, and the individuals can also be characterized in terms
of a variety of sociocultural attributes, attitudes, and values.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
RESEARCH STRATEGY

If hypoxic stress does reduce the fecundity of native high altitude populations
and thus lowers their fertility, the reduction does not appear to be substantial
(Dutt, 1976). If this is the case, it will be
difficult to demonstrate an altituderelated reduction among those segments
of the population who are consciously
controlling the number of offspring they
have. On the other hand, such a reduction
should be most apparent among those
women who are not regulating their fertility. In addition, many sociocultural varia

bles which may indirectly affect reproductive performance such as education,
occupation, age of marriage, etc., vary
with altitude, and it is often difficult to determine if the fertility differences associated with altitude are related to the effects of hypoxia or to sociocultural
differences between high and low altitude
populations. Therefore, the research
strategy utilized in the present study was
to compare the fertility experience of selected samples of women who reside at
different altitudes and who do not use any
method of contraception. By limiting the
study sample to women who had similar
socioeconomic backgrounds, sociocultural differences between the samples which
might have influenced fertility were minimized.

The primary data bank from which the
present samples were drawn was composed of detailed socioeconomic and fertility information for 2,524 Bolivian
women. Preliminary analysis of these data
by the Centro Nacional de la Familia
(C.E.P., 1969) and Dutt (1976) indicated
that the original sample was composed of
women who varied greatly in terms of
marital status, educational attainment,
knowledge and use of contraceptives, etc.
There were significant relationships between a number of these soctocultural variables and both altitude and fertility. In order to reduce the effects of this cultural
variability, women were selected for inclusion in the study sample only if they
met the following criteria: They had been
or were married (including consensual unions), had no more than five years of education, worked at an unskilled craft if employed, and had never used any method of
contraception. A woman was included
only if her husband had a similar educational level and unskilled occupation. Asa

homogeneous group (with respect to these
cultural characteristics) of some 900

women from various altitudes was selected.

Stupy AREAS

Questionnaires were given to a sample
of the rural and urban populations of the
Departments of La Paz, Cochabamba,
and Santa Cruz. A brief description of
each area follows.

The Department of La Paz is located in
the northwestern part of Bolivia and has a
population of over one milion, most of
whom reside in the city of La Paz or on the
altiplano to the west and north of the city
and live at altitudes of from 3,000 to 4,500
meters. The altiplano is populated primarily by Aymara Indians who have little or
no education and who subsist on agriculture and/or herding or work in mines. This
rural population lives for the most part in
small nucleated settlements of 50 to 1,000
people, with occasional dispersed households found in the vicinity of Lake Titicaca.

The Department of Cochabamba, located in the center of Bolivia, is situated
on the eastern slopes of the Andes. The
majority of its population lives in the Cochabamba and Cliza valleys at altitudes
from 2,000 to 3,000 meters. Most of the inhabitants of the department are Quechua
Indians and are nonliterate subsistence
agriculturalists.

The Department of Santa Cruz, the
largest of Bolivia’s nine departments, is
located in the southeastern section of the
country. Generally the terrain is low and
flat, rangingfrom 400 to 1,500 meters in altitude. Most of the population lives within
a hundred kilometer radius of the city of
Santa Cruz. The basis of the local
economy is agriculture; but unlike the Departments of La Paz and Cochabamba,
much of the agriculture in Santa Cruz is
mechanized and market oriented. The
population of the department is also distinct, including racially mixed groups as

well as recent Quechua and Aymara migrants from the highlands. Nearly everyone speaks Spanish, and most have had
some formal education.

DATA COLLECTION

The data used in the present study were
collected by a Bolivian governmental
agency, the National Center for the Family (Centro Nacional de la Familia—
C.E.P.). The study was one of a number
of studies of the sociocultural basis of fertility conducted by the Latin American
Center for Demography (CELADE). The
questionnaire utilized in the collection of
the data was based on an instrument developed by CELADE and CELAP (Centro Latino America de Poblacion) for use
in Latin America and had been translated
into Quechua and Aymara and extensively tested for use in Bolivia. The questionnaire consisted of some eighty questions, took between one and two hours to
administer, and was given by trained bilingual college-educated women. During the
interviews, information of the following
types was collected: (1) basic biological
and socioeconomic characteristics of the
woman and her family of orientation and
family of procreation; (2) ideals and
norms relating to fertility; (3) norms and
attitudes toward life in general; (4) knowledge and use of methods of contraception;
and (5) acomplete fertility history that included data on abortions, stillbirths, and
age at death of offspring who had died.

Samples were obtained from the rural
and urban populations of the three departments previously described. These departments were selected because each
represented one of the three major ecological zones in Boliva: the altiplano, La
Paz; the high mountain valleys, Cochabamba; and the eastern plains, Santa
Cruz. Each department had the largest
population of any department within that
particular ecological zone, and together

they constituted nearly three-fifths of the
country’s population. For the purposes of
the study, urban residence was defined as
living in a community with a population of
at least 10,000, which had running water,
electricity and public transportation,
while rural residence was defined as residing in the country or in acommunity of less
than 2,000 having none of the public services previously mentioned. In order to increase the probability that the women interviewed were representative of the total
population of each of the departments, a
relatively complex sampling strategy was
developed. Briefly, this strategy involved
dividing the area to be sampled into a
number of units and interviewing women
selected at random from a random selection of these units. A detailed discussion
of the strategy used is given in C.E.P.
(1969) and Dutt (1976).

THE STuDY SAMPLES

Based on the preliminary analysis relating socioeconomic variables to fertility
control, 906 women were selected for the
study sample. They were grouped according to department of residence, and thus
altitude, and according to whether they
lived in a rural or urban setting. During
the analysis, the rural and urban components for each altitude were generally not
grouped together but treated separately.
The finding of significant rural-urban differences would suggest the presence of sociocultural differences which could
otherwise go unnoticed and which might
be important in interpreting any observed
altitude-related differences in the study
samples. Similarly, the medium altitude
sample was included as an additional
check. If hypoxic stress is an important
factor affecting fecundity, then mediumaltitude natives would most likely show an
intermediate response. The finding of
highly disparate results for this group

Altitude and Fertility 105

would again suggest the presence of important sociocultural differences between
the samples.

The size of each of the six samples is
shown in Table 1. Sample sizes ranged
from 45 for the urban Santa Cruz sample
to 326 for the rural La Paz sample. The differences in size of the samples reflect differences in the numbers of women interviewed originally and sociocultural
differences between the departments.

BIOLOGICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC
CHARACTERISTICS

Data on age, age at marriage, and
schooling are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
Women in the samples ranged from 17 to
50 years of age; the mean age of women in
each sample is shown in Table 1. Means
ranged from 30.0 years for rural Santa
Cruz women to 34.4 years for urban Cochabamba women. While there were no
significant differences in the means,
analysis of the distribution of women in
five-year cohorts indicated that there were
signficantly more women in the younger
age groups in the low altitude samples
than in the high altitude samples
(P<0.05).

Summaries of marital and educational
characteristics of the women are provided
in Table 2. The typical woman in each
sample was married and living with her
husband or was a partner in a consensual
union. There were some differences between the samples, however. Significantly
more Santa Cruz women were part of consensual unions (P<0.05); and twice as
many urban women as rural women reported that they were not living with a
man at the time of the interview. Fewer
than 5 per cent of the women in each sample reported having had more than one
mate. Data on age at first marriage are
given in Table 1. Although women from
Santa Cruz married somewhat earlier than

did women from the other two departments, the differences were not
significant.

Examination of the educational characteristics presented in Table 2 indicates that
the samples differ significantly with respect to literacy, language, and education.
Women from Santa Cruz were more likely

to have had some formal education, to
speak Spanish in the home, and to read

and write than were women from the De
partments of Cochabamba and La Paz.
These differences are also reflected in differences in the mean number of years of
primary education (see Table 1).

Samples were also distinct from one

another in the prime language, that is, the
language commonly used in the home (see
Table 2). The majority of women in La
Paz spoke Aymara at home. Quechua was
the most commonly spoken language in
Cochabamba. Nearly all Santa Cruz
women spoke Spanish at home.

The data presented above indicated
that while the study samples were similar
there were considerable differences between them, in particular with respect to
education. To determine whether these
differences were significantly related to
fertility and thus might confound the effect of altitude on fertility, the relationship of these variables and fertility as
measured by number of live births was

Altitude and Fertility 107

analyzed within each sample and between
samples using a variety of statistical techniques including correlation and multiple
regression analyses. None of these variables was found to be significantly related
to the number of live births.

RESULTS
GENERAL REPRODUCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS

women. Statistical analysis indicated that
the rural-urban differences were
significant (P<0.05) and that there was a
significant interaction between altitude
and rural-urban residence (P<0.05). A
covariance analysis with age as the covariate indicated that the differences were not
associated with differences in the age composition of the samples. Further analysis
indicated that both the rural-urban effect
and the interaction were related to the
greater number of live births reported by
urban Cochabamba women. There was
little variation in the mean number of live
births for women in the other samples,
and the means were nearly identical when
the effects of age differences among the
samples were controlled through the
analysis of covariance.

Table 3 also provides data on the mean
number of children living at the time of the
interview. Means ranged from nearly
three living children among urban La Paz
women to more than four among urban
Cochabamba women. While rural-urban
differences were not significant, there was
a significant altitude effect (P<0.05)
which remained when the effects of age
differences among the women were controlled through an analysis of covariance.
There was also a significant interaction
(P<0.05) between altitude and ruralurban residence which was related to the
relatively higher fertility of the urban Cochabamba sample. Since there were
significant differences in the mean number
of living children, a measure of child survival, the survival ratio, was calculated.
The ratio of the number of living children
to the number of live births was computed
for each woman reporting at least one live
birth. The mean survival ratio for each
sample is given in Table 3. While there
was no significant rural-urban effect, the
differences between the samples from the
three altitudes were significant at the
0.001 level.

Social Biology

The mean age at menarche for women
in each sample is presented in Table 4.
Means ranged from slightly less than 13
for urban Cochabamba women to slightly
more than 13 for the urban Santa Cruz
women. The differences were not
significant.

The mean age at first live birth is also
given in Table 4. The first pregnancy occurred slightly earlier among women residing at low altitude. The differences
were Significant at the 0.05 level. A
significant interaction between altitude
and rural-urban residence was also noted
(P<0.05). This appeared to be the result
of an older age at first live birth among
rural Cochabamba women.

COMPLETED FERTILITY

Completed fertility is generally defined
as the total reproductive performance of
women who have completed the childbearing period, women 45 or more years
of age. In the present analysis, women 40
to 44 years of age were also included in the
analysis of completed fertility. This was
done because there were relatively few
women between the ages of 45 and 50 and
because the age-specific fertility rates
during the period from 40 to 45 were quite
low. The addition of these women increased the sample sizes substantially but
did not significantly reduce estimates of
completed fertility.

A summary of the mean number of live
births, mean number of living children,
and the mean survival ratio for women age
40 or older are presented in Table 5. The
data show a pattern similar to that found
for the complete sample. The mean number of live births ranged from slightly
more than five for rural Cochabamba
women to slightly more than seven for urban Cochabamba women. The ruralurban differences were significant at the
0.05 level, while there was no significant
altitude effect. Further analysis indicated

that the significant rural-urban difference
was associated with the relatively high
number of live births reported by urban
Cochabamba women.

A different pattern appears when the
number of living children is examined.
The mean number of living children
ranged from slightly fewer than 4 for urban La Paz women to more than 5.5 for urban Santa Cruz women. Women residing
at high altitude had significantly fewer living children than did women residing at
low altitude, and rural women had fewer
children than did urban women (P<0.05).

Since there were significant differences
in number of living children, the survival
ratio, the ratio of living children to total
live births, was calculated for each woman
(see Table 5). Analysis of variance indicated that the altitude differences were
significant at the 0.0001 level.

CHILD MORTALITY

It was noted during the analysis of the
fertility data that although there were no
significant differences in numbers of live
births, women residing at altitude had
significantly fewer living children, suggesting that there were important differences in the mortality of offspring. In
addition to the date of birth, the age at

death was available for all live offspring
who had died. These data were analyzed
to determine how the mortality experience of the three groups differed.

Age-specific mortality rates were calculated for several age groups for each
sample. These rates are given in Table 6.
Mortality was higher among the offspring
of the high altitude women for al] age
groups with the exception of ages 5-10,
when low altitude children had a slightly
greater mortality rate. Urban children had
a slightly higher mortality rate than did
rural children during the first year of life,
while the reverse was true for the period
from 1-4 years of age.

The significance of these differences
was tested using multidimensional contingency analysis (Fienberg, 1970).

tionship between education and child
mortality, a series of analyses were performed. These analyses indicated that although there was a small negative correlation between the years of education and
the survival ratio, it was not significant
when the effects of age were controlled.
No significant effect of educational level
upon the survival index was found in a covariance analysis, while altitude was
found to have an highly significant effect
(p<0.001).

DISCUSSION

Due to the wide variety of biological,
cultural, and environmental variables
which affect fertility, research studying
the effect of altitude on fertility is likely to
be complicated by a number of factors
which may reduce either the accuracy of
the results or the generality of the conclusions. During the course of the present research, several such problems became evident.

The data analyzed in the study were
collected as part of one of the KAP
(Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices)
studies of human fertility sponsored by the
United Nations. These studies have been

criticized because of their total reliance on
questionnaires to obtain data and the retrospective nature of the data gathered. In
the present study it was impossible to verify independently the information collected in the interviews.

A second major concern involved differences between the samples with respect
to ethnic background and sociocultural
characteristics. Although all samples were
composed of women from the lower socioeconomic level, there were important
differences in ethnic affiliation. In addition, the women in the Santa Cruz samples
were generally better educated than
women in the other samples. However,
analyses indicated that these differences
were not associated with variations in fertility, and they would not appear to
present a problem in interpreting the data.

Finally, the study can be criticized because information is lacking on several
factors directly related to fertility. No data
were collected on the frequency of intercourse or the amount of temporary abstinence due to either cultural taboos or
the temporary absence of the woman or
her mate. Given the differences among
the samples, such factors may vary from

one group to the next and could affect fertility.

Despite these limitations, the present
study represents an improvement over
past research in this area. Because the
samples were drawn from the population
of a large geographic area rather than the
population of a single community whose
similarity to the larger area is unknown,
the samples should be representative of
the total population. Detailed socioeconomic data and information on
childhood mortality as well as a fertility
history were available for each woman.
The samples could be compared with respect to many factors known to influence
fertility and analytical techniques could be
used to reduce the effects of confounding
variables.

While reduced levels of fertility for
highland areas have been found in previous studies of census data from Peru and
Bolivia (Monge, 1948; Heer, 1964; James,
1966), no significant altitude-related differences in numbers of live births were
found in the present study. These contradictory results appear to reflect differences in the types of data analyzed by
the various researchers. In the present investigation reproductive histories were
available for each woman, and reproductive performance was measured by the
number of live births. Demographers analyzing census data have of necessity used
relatively crude measures of fertility such
as the child-woman ratio of a census unit.
In comparisons of such fertility estimates,
differences in the percentage of single
never-married women or differences in
early childhood mortality rates among the
populations being studied will affect the
fertility estimates and limit their comparability.

One of the most important findings of
the present study is the increased childhood mortality among the offspring of the
high altitude women. Early childhood

Altitude and Fertility 111

mortality, here defined as mortality
during the first four years of life, was positively correlated with altitude. More than
25 per cent of the offspring of the highland
women died before the age of five, 20 per
cent of the offspring of the mediumaltitude women died, while only 15 per
cent of the low altitude offspring died
during the same period. These findings are
supported by those of Mazess (1965) who
reported that in Peru neonatal mortality
was positively correlated with altitude.
The reasons for the increased child mortality at altitude are not clear. A variety of
factors may be responsible, among them
medical care, sanitation, child care, nutrition, and hypoxic stress. The lack of a
significant relationship between years of
education and the survival ratio and the
lack of important rural-urban differences
in mortality suggest that hypoxic stress
may be an important factor.

In the present study while there were
no significant differences in the number of
live births, the number of living offspring
and the survival ratio were significantly
lower for high altitude women as a result
of the increased childhood mortality.
These results suggest that some of the fertility estimates obtained from census data
for highland areas may significantly underestimate actual reproductive performance
and that fertility differences reported from
analyses of census data actually may reflect
differences in infant and child mortality and
not differences in the numbers of liveborns.

The higher neonatal and infant mortality rates among the offspring of high altitude women add another dimension to the
relationship between altitude and fertility
and further increase the difficulties in
assessing the impact of altitude on fertility
and fecundity. There is increasing evidence that lactation reduces fecundity,
particularly during the first year after the
birth of the child (Jain et al., 1970). An
early death of the newborn ends lactation

and lactation amenorrhea, ovulation begins again, and the woman is once more
susceptible to becoming pregnant. As a
result of a high infant death rate, intervals
between pregnancies may be shortened,
possibly increasing the total number of
births relative to the total number expected if early deaths had not occurred. If
infant mortality is increased at high altitude, then one might expect a slightly
greater increase in completed fertility
among high altitude women if all other
factors were the same. There also may be
built-in sociocultural responses to child
mortality, i.e., the concept of reproductive compensation. Sociocultural factors
related to reproduction may act to increase the probability that a dead child is
“replaced.” .

Urban Cochabamba women had
significantly greater fertility (number of
live births) than that reported by women
in the other five samples. The factors responsible for these differences are unclear, but may be related to the small size
of the sample or perhaps to specific socioeconomic conditions not measured
during data collection. This difference illustrates some of the problems inherent in
the study of individual communities. It is
often assumed with little or no supporting
evidence that the population of the community sampled is representative of the
larger population of which it is a part.
Generalizations about the larger population are then made on the basis of the
study of the specific community. In comparison, the strategy used in the present
project, that of obtaining a random sample of women from a number of communities rather than relying on the study of a
single small population, is more likely to
produce results which are representative
of the population of the larger geographic
area.

It should be stressed that these results
are not offered as proof that hypoxic stress

has no affect on human fecundity, 1.e., reproductive potential. There is strong evidence that various aspects of the reproductive system of low altitude natives are
affected by migration to high altitude, and
the reproductive system of highland natives may also be affected (Clegg and
Harrison, 1971; Clegg, 1978). The fact
that no significant reduction in fertility
was found at altitude may reflect developmental or genetic adaptation to the high
altitude environment or cultural practices
which act to reinforce reproduction and
thus compensate for the effects of hypoxia.
Although no evidence of different normative values relating to fertility was
found in the present study, it is possible
that such differences are subtle and were
not measured in the process of data collection.

It is suggested, however, that if altitude
does affect fecundity, its impact on the reproductive performance of the highland
population of Bolivia is relatively minor.
Given the wide variety of cultural variables which are known to be related to human reproduction and the cultural and ecOlogical differences between the
highlands and lowlands, it is questionable
whether analyses of census data or even
individual reproductive histories such as
those used in the present study are an appropriate method for studying the effect
of hypoxia on human reproduction. On
the basis of the present research it is felt
that the impact of hypoxia on human fertility can only be determined by the detailed study of the reproductive physiology of native highland populations.
