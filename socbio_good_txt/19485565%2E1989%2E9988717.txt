Ethnicity, Sibling, and Family Correlates
of Young Adults’ Status Attainment:

A Follow-Up Study

ABSTRACT: Longitudinal data were used to examine relationships among sibling variables, perceptions of family environments, and measures of educational attainment, occupational status,
and occupational aspirations. The analyses involved 21-year-old Australians from AngloAustralian, Greek, and Southern Italian families. Regression surfaces were plotted from
models that included terms to test for possible linear, interaction, and curvilinear associations
among the variables. The study indicated that sibsize and birth order continued to have many
significant associations with young adults’ status attainment even after taking into account the
mediating influence of perceived family environments. Also, the investigation suggested that
there are ethnic-group differences in relations among sibling variables, perceived parents’ support for learning, and young adults’ status attainment.

In a previous study, Marjoribanks
(1985) examined relationships between
sibling variables and perceptions of family learning environments for adolescents from different Australian ethnic
groups. Generally, the investigation revealed that (a) there were ethnic-group
variations in the associations between
sibling variables and adolescents’ perceptions of their parents’ support for
learning, and (b) within the ethnic
groups the relations between sibling and
family environment variables differed
depending on whether the perceptions
of fathers’ and mothers’ support for
learning were being considered. It was
suggested, therefore, that our understanding of the impact of sibling variables on individuals’ outcomes might be
enhanced by studies that take into account individuals’ perceptions of their
family environments. That is, perceived
family influences might act as an impor
tant mediating variable between sibling
and outcome measures.

This study was generated from that
suggestion of the earlier investigation.
Data from the prior analysis were used
to examine relations among sibling variables, perceptions of family environments, and measures of educational attainment, occupational status, and
occupational aspirations, when the subjects were 21-years-old. There have
been few longitudinal analyses that have
examined relations between sibling variables and status-attainment measures.
In a review of research on birth order
and sibsize effects, for example, Heer
(1985) concludes that relations between
such sibling variables and measures of
educational attainment and occupational status need further investigation.
Also, Hauser and Sewell (1985) suggest
that for a more complete understanding
of social inequality, studies are required

that examine associations between sibling variables and outcomes such as occupational status.

Moreover, the study was designed to
examine the admixture model of sibling
relations. The model suggests that the
significant relationships found in many
sibling investigations may be an artifact
of the pooling of social groups (see Page
and Grandon, 1979; Laosa, 1984; Valencia et al., 1985). It is proposed, therefore, that analyses of sibling correlates
of individuals’ attributes should be conducted within different subpopulations
such as ethnic groups. In this longitudinal study, relationships were examined
among sibling variables, perceived parents’ support for learning, and statusattainment measures, for young adults
from different Australian ethnic groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The sample included 180 AngloAustralian, 88 Greek, and 72 Southern
Italian young adults. When the subjects
were 11-years-old, birth order and sibsize data were collected during parent
interviews, for an analysis of the sibling
correlates of children’s academic
achievement (Marjoribanks, 1981).
From those interviews, families were
classified as Greek or Southern Italian if
both parents had migrated to Australia
before or just after the birth of their 11year-old child and if Greek or Italian
was the language typically spoken in
their respective homes. In AngloAustralian families both parents were
born in either Australia or England, and
English was the only language spoken in
the home.

In a follow-up analysis, five years
later, a structured questionnaire was
used to gather data about the 16-year

olds’ perceptions of their parents’ educational and occupational aspirations
for them, the encouragement they received from their parents for staying on
at school, and their parents’ general interest in their education. From the responses, two factor scales, each of eight
items, were constructed. The environment dimensions were labeled as adolescents’ perceptions of their fathers’
and mothers’ support for learning, and
they had theta reliability estimates
greater than 0.75.

In the final collection of data the subjects were 21 years old, and measures
were obtained of their educational and
occupational attainments as well as their
occupational aspirations. A 7-point
scale was used to construct educational
attainment scores while occupational attainment was coded using a prestigerating index that ranks approximately
300 occupations in the Australian context (Broom et al., 1980). Occupational
aspirations were measured by the same
scale that was used to gauge occupational attainment.

RESULTS

Because of the relatively limited sample size in each ethnic group for undertaking multivariate analyses, the data
were not examined separately for females and males, which is a restriction of
the study. Also, findings from the investigation need to be interpreted within
the limitation that the sample was not
random. Throughout the analyses, however, adjustments were made for the design effects of the sample. Significance
levels were adjusted using the formula:
standard error of sample estimate =
(design effect) '* x simple random
sample standard error (Ross, 1987).

zoe ble curvilinear associations. That is, the

models were of the form: Z = aX +
bY + cX:Y + dx? + eY* + constant,
where Z, X, and Y represented measures of the young adults’ outcomes, sibling variables, and perceptions of parents’ support for learning, respectively.
If the addition of interaction or squared
terms was not associated with a significant increment in the amount of variance in outcome scores, then the terms
were deleted from the particular model.

When interaction and curvilinear
terms make a significant contribution to
the variation in dependent measures, it
is necessary to interpret with caution the
regression weights in the resulting full
regression model. Once such higher order terms are added to a regression
model, the coefficients of linear forms of
the related variables become unstable.
In Table 2, therefore, if interaction or
curvilinear terms were significant, then
only the regression weights associated
with those variables are designated as
being statistically significant. The implication is, of course, that the related linear term was significant before the addition of the higher order term and that its
continued significance is reflected in the
addition of the associated later term.
Also, in order to reduce multicollinearity in the regression models, each variable was transformed by subtracting
means from the raw scores of the relevant measures.

In Table 2 the results show that, in
each ethnic group, the sibling and family
environment variables combined to
have moderate to strong associations
with the outcome measures. The raw regression weights also indicate the possible complexity of relationships among
the variables with the presence of significant curvilinear relations in a number
of the regression models. In three of the

 

Social Biology

models, the sibling impact on outcomes
was mediated by the addition of the
family environment measures. These relations involved sibsize, fathers’ support, and Southern Italians’ educational
attainment; birth order, fathers’ support, and occupational aspirations in the
Anglo-Australian group; and birth order, mothers’ support, and AngloAustralians’ occupational aspirations.
In nearly half of the models, however,
the sibling variables continued to have
significant associations with the outcome measures after the addition of the
family perception measures.

In the Marjoribanks (1985) study the
results indicated that sibling variables
continued to have some significant associations with adolescents’ perceptions of
their parents’ support for learning, even
after taking into account the impact of
earlier environment variables. There
was, for example, a significant negative
relationship between sibsize and fathers’ support, holding constant social
status, for Anglo-Australians. Also,
there was a statistically significant negative association between sibsize and
mothers’ support, holding constant social status, for Greek Australians. It
needs to be emphasized, therefore, that
the present findings in Table 2 represent
only the direct effects of the sibling variables, holding constant either fathers’ or
mothers’ support. That is, the total effect of the sibling variables on status attainment also includes an indirect effect
of the sibling measures on status outcomes through their effects on adolescents’ perceptions of parents’ support
for learning.

From the regression weights shown
in Table 2, regression surfaces were
plotted to explore further the nature of
group variations in the relationships

among the variables. Because of space
limitations it was not possible to present
all the surfaces that were constructed.
Instead, six surfaces that depict the nature of the different associations among
the variables have been chosen and presented in two figures. Scores for the
figures were standardized with means of
50 and standard deviations of 10.

In Figure 1, the surfaces show the
regression-fitted relations among birth
order, perceptions of mothers’ support,
and the young adults’ occupational status. The surface for Anglo-Australian

young adults is representative of those
regression models in which the sibling
variables were not related significantly
to outcomes but where the perception
measures had significant associations
with the status attainment measures. In
contrast, the surface for Southern Italian young adults indicates significant relationships between occupational status
and both the birth order and perception
variables. At each birth order level, for
example, increases in mothers’ support
scores from 30 to 70 were associated
with increments of approximately 14

mothers’ support, increases in birth order from one to six were related to decrements of approximately eight
regression-fitted points in the occupational status scores of the Southern Italians.

The shape of the surface for Greek

curvilinear relationship between perceived mothers’ support and occupational status. Mothers’ support tended

there were sizeable increments in
occupational-status scores at each birth

approximately 50, further increases in
perceived mothers’ support were not related to changes in occupational status.
Also, increases in birth order from one

size, perceptions of fathers’ support,
and the young adults’ occupational aspirations. The shapes of the surface for
Anglo-Australian and Greek young
adults indicate that sibsize was not related significantly to aspirations. In contrast, at each sibsize level, perceived fathers’ support had moderate to strong
associations with aspirations. Across the
range of fathers’ support scores, for example, there were regression-fitted increments of 9 and 20 points in aspirations for Anglo-Australian and Greek
young adults, respectively. For Southern Italians, sibsize had a curvilinear association with occupational aspirations.
Successive increases in sibsize were associated with increased decrements in
occupational aspirations, at each value
of perceived fathers’ support.

DISCUSSION

The present analysis has indicated
that sibsize and birth order continued to
have many significant associations with
young adults’ status attainment after
taking into account the mediating influence of family perception measures.
Also, the study suggested that there are
ethnic-group differences in relations
among sibling variables, perceived parents’ support for learning, and status attainment. That is, by using longitudinal
data, refined family environment varia
Social Biology

bles, and regression surface analysis, the
investigation has provided support for
the proposition of Blake (1985, 1986)
and Mare and Chen (1986) that sibling
variables need to be incorporated into
research and theory building about social stratification.

Much of the family environment research that is undertaken concentrates
on an examination of between-family
factors. As McCall (1983) suggests, such
factors might be expected to influence
all children in a family approximately to
the same extent. There is a need in family research, however, to consider in
greater detail those environmental factors such as sibling variables and perceptions of parents’ support that might, in
their effects on outcomes, be specific to
individuals. This present study has built
upon the earlier investigation by Marjoribanks (1985) and has revealed the
importance of examining such withinfamily environment factors for a more
complete understanding of differences
in status-attainment outcomes. Also,
the investigation has supported the admixture model which suggests that analyses of sibling relationships should be
undertaken within different subpopulations. It is likely, therefore, that our understanding of sibling influences will be
enhanced by further investigations that
include other within-family environment measures for individuals from different social groups.
