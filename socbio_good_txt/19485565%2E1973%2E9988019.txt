Differentials in Fertility Among
Black Doctorates

Kent G. Mommsen

Depariment of Sociology
University of Utah
Salt Lake City, Utah

Recent demographic studies of black
Americans have indicated that the growth
of this population will be most influenced
by fertility trends (Farley, 1970). In light
of this observation, it is somewhat puzzling
to discover a fairly substantial gap in the
literature with regard to the determinants
of black fertility. Although the negative
association between socioeconomic status
(SES) and black fertility has been well
documented (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1971a), possible determinants within the
various SES levels have been unexplored.
Most studies have examined the influence
of a number of demographic variables on
the fertility of the total black American
population. The present study explores the
hypothesis that these traditional demographic fertility determinants may have a
differential impact within SES levels of the
black population.

Previous investigations (Farley, 1970;
U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1971a, b) have
found that the number of children a woman
has in her lifetime will be influenced by
various social and economic characteristics
including rural-urban residence, educational
attainment, labor force status, the occupation of her husband, and the income of her
family. In the present study, these and

 

other variables previously found to be
associated with black fertility are examined
for a national sample of blacks with a high
level of educational attainment.

This procedure has the effect of controlling the impact of education, one indicator
of SES, on fertility. The research question
may be stated as follows: After the influence of high education on fertility has been
controlled (black doctorates only), will
traditional demographic variables continue
to exert an influence on black fertility? If
so, how much? Variables to be examined
include: parent’s fertility, region of birth,
rural-urban origins, father’s occupation,
father’s education, present income, region
of present residence and religion. Although
in the present study, SES does not vary,
this third variable is assumed to intervene
between the independent variables mentioned above and fertility, except in the
case of income, residence, and religion
where the temporal ordering is not clear.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Data for the present study were collected
as part of a larger investigation into the
career patterns of black American academic
doctorates (Mommsen, 1970). Black professionals are represented in the present

study by a national nonprobability sample
of black American doctorates, which constitutes approximately one-third of the
known population.?

The initial methodological problem of
the present research was the accurate identification of a population from which to
draw a sample. Since no current listing of
all living black American doctorates existed,
a variety of methods were employed in developing a master mailing list.? A master
mailing list of 2,305 names and addresses
of persons believed to be in the population
was compiled. After two waves of mail
questionnaires, 1,384 responses were obtained. Of these returns, 317 were undeliverable,? 281 (20.3%) were not in the
population being studied,* and 785 were
usable questionnaires. The overwhelming
reason for a respondent’s eliminating him
1Bond (1967) estimated that there were approximately 1,600 to 1,800 living blacks who held
the doctoral degree (yearly production of about
160 or 1% of the annual American output). The
Ford Foundation survey (1969) identified 2,280
living black American doctorates, excluding M.D.,
D.D.S. and D.V.M. degrees. The present sample
of 785 is 34% of this estimate.

2Letters were sent to various persons and organizations known to have partial lists of the
population to be studied. The author is indebted
to Drs. Horace Mann Bond, Thomas D. Jarrett,
and Mack Jones, all of Atlanta University and
James E. Conyers of Indiana State University for
their generous cooperation in this regard. The primary source used was a list maintained for many
years through 1959 by the late Dr. Rufus E.
Clement, former president of Atlanta University.
Several sources were used to verify, update, and
supplement the Clement list: American Men of
Science: A Biographical Directory (1968), The
World of Learning 1968-69, Directory of Americon Scholars: A Biographical Directory (1969),
Who’s Wko in American Education (1968), James
E. Conyers’ list of black doctorates in sociology,
Mack Jones’ list of black doctorates in political
Science, and the available college catalogs of the
85 institutions listed in the Directory of Predominantly Negro Colleges and Universities in the
United States of America (1969).

8 These questionnaires were undeliverable because the addressee was either deceased or his
current address was unknown.

4If any respondent was not in the population
being studied by virtue of his race, citizenship, or
academic achievement, he was requested to return
the unanswered questionnaire.

self was that he was Caucasian.5 It was
therefore reasoned that a similar percentage
of the nonrespondents would also have been
eliminated from the study had they responded. Hence, it was estimated that some
187 nonrespondents (20.3%) would not
have been in the population. The rate of
response for the present study using an adjusted® base figure was 52%.

Since the parameters of the total population of black American doctorates are unknown, the representativeness of the
present sample cannot be established. The
possibility, however, that the present
sample is grossly atypical has been shown
to be unlikely by establishing “comparability” with the recent and more extensive
Ford Foundation survey (Bryant, 1969) of
the same population.’ Two possible biases,
older respondents age “60 and over” and
respondents from the South, have been discussed elsewhere (Mommsen, 1970, pp. 3941), Although it is unlikely that either bias
would have much impact on fertility, if it
did, the tendency would be to reduce the
over-all fertility of the sample (see Table 2
and 4), since the oldest respondents and

5 The procedure of obtaining the names and
addresses of all doctorates listed in black college
bulletins is responsible for this outcome. Although
persons of obvious non-Negroid ethnic origin
could be excluded immediately (e.g., Chinese),
Caucasians were difficult to eliminate.

8 The original base figure of 2,305 was reduced
by 317 undeliverables, 381 respondents not in the
population, and 187 estimated nonrespondents not
in the population. The adjusted base figure is
1,520. Although a 52% rate of return may appear
low, this should probably be compared with other
recent attempts to survey this same population.
Using extremely short questionnaires and more
“legitimate” bases for research, Bond (1967) obtained a 57% return and Bryant (1969) a 48%
return. The present questionnaire was more Sensitive and longer (16 pages) than either of these
studies (see Mommsen, 1970).

TDetails of this argument can be found in
Mommsen (1970, pp. 40-41) where data on five
common variables are presented: age at time of
survey, time for completing degree requirements,
age at which doctorate was received, sex, and field
in which degrees were conferred.

those from the South reported the lowest
fertility.

Fertility, the dependent variable in the
present investigation, was measured by
asking respondents: “How many children
have you had?’’® Respondents who were
separated, divorced, or widowed (10.4% of
the sample) did respond to the fertility
question and were included in the final
analysis. Twenty never-married singles reporting children, however, were eliminated
from the sample along with other nevermarried singles.® Only 1% of the total
sample (V = 785) failed to respond to the
fertility item.

RESULTS

Black doctorates report smaller families
than do either whites or all black Amer
8 One possible problem with the wording of this
item is its failure to clearly distinguish between
biological and adopted children. The census uses
the following wording to overcome this difficulty:
“How many babies have you ever had, not counting stillbirths?” This question was asked of
women who were reported as married, separated,
widowed, or divorced. Single never-married
women were presumed to be childless (U.S. Bureau of the Census, November 1969, p. 4).

® This decision is based primarily on convention.
Since reliability comes into question with regard
to self-reported illegitimate births, it is probably
unwise to use such data. The possibility of coding
error is also a consideration. The number of
never-married singles reporting children was quite
small (N == 20). A total of 44 children, however,
was reported by these respondents: 8 reported one
child; 4 reported two; 5 reported three; 2 reported four; and 1 reported five children,

icans (Table 1). The median number of
children for this sample of ever-married
black professionals is 1.76, compared with
2.49 for all blacks and 2.15 for whites.
Black doctorates were found to be less
likely than other black Americans to have
four, five, or more children. Where 8% of
these black professionals have had four
children, almost 12% of the general black
population reported this number. Even
more striking is the low incidence of five
or more children: 5% among black doctorates compared with 11% of the white
population and 25% of all blacks, Further,
black doctorates report a greater incidence
of childlessness (19%) than either whites
(15%) or other blacks (13%). Finally,
more black doctorates have one or two children than other Americans. Although the
evidence is indirect, strong support for the
upward mobility hypothesis is suggested by
these data. That is, black professionals, like
their white counterparts, seem to consciously limit fertility in an effort to consolidate financial resources and maximize
upward mobility.

Table 2 examines the relationship between age and fertility in the present
sample of black American doctorates. Using
Goodman and Kruskal’s (1954) gamma, a
weak negative association (G = —0.20) between age and fertility of the respondents
was found. Median number of children by

age categories reflects more precisely the
nature of this relationship. With the exception of the youngest age category in which
small numbers is a problem, the median
number of children is found to be inversely
related to age. This mild negative relationship was to be expected since a similar relationship is found in the general black
population between the ages of 35 and 44
years (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969) .!°

In order to control for this effect of age
on fertility, a standardization procedure
was employed using the full sample as the
standard population (Rosenberg, 1962).
Hence, in standardized tables 4 through 9,
fertility percentages have been weighted
according to the proportions of the sample
in the several age intervals.

REGION OF RESIDENCE

Since persistent and substantial regional
differences in childbearing have been found
in the black population in general, this
variable was examined for the present sample. Examining ratios of children ages 0 to
4 to women 15 to 44, Farley (1970) reports
that black women who live in the South
have been more fertile than women outside
the South at each date for which information is available from 1880 through 1967.

This regional differential, however, did
not hold for the black professionals examined in the present study. Table 4 pre

median number of children by parents’
fertility revealed no apparent relationship.

had, no stable pattern emerged with regard
to how many children they would have

between region of residence and fertility.
With age controlled, the fertility of black
doctorates was not found to be greater in
the South than in other regions. On the
contrary, the median number of children
was found to be lower for residents of the
South (1.71) than for residents of the
Northeast (1.93), North Central (1.96) or
Western (2.67) regions. It appears likely
that increased geographic mobility of the
present sample, compared with all black
women, might account for the disappearance of this relationship.

RURAL-URBAN ORIGINS

Demographers have observed (Farley,
1970) that women who are reared in rural
areas have different fertility patterns than
those raised in cities.

In the present sample, respondents were
asked to indicate the approximate size of
their hometown: “Before reaching eighteen
years of age, where was most of your life
spent?” These data are somewhat unique
since United States censuses have not asked
women if they were reared in rural or
urban areas.

The influence on fertility of being raised
in a rural background is examined in Table

5. Interestingly, the traditional rural-urban
(hometown before 18 years of age) differential is upheld for the black professionals
in the sample. Respondents raised in “large
urban” communities had the fewest children (1.64) followed by “medium urban”
(1.79) and “rural” (1.83). It should be
noted, however, that the differences are
quite small.

SOCIOECONOMIC ORIGINS

The effect of the respondents’ original
SES on fertility was examined by using
father’s occupation (Table 6) and father’s
education (Table 7). Neither of these SES

variables appeared to be strongly related to
fertility of the respondents when age was
controlled. A comparison of medians in extreme categories, however, does reveal a
slight inverse relationship as might be expected: 0.11 of a child less in the case of
high occupations and 0.13 of a child less
in the case of a college education.

PRESENT SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS

Two frequently used indicators of SES
are a man’s income and his educational
attainment. Since, for the present sample,
no variation exists with regard to education
(all respondents had doctorates), analysis
was restricted to examining differentials in
fertility by annual income for 1970. Table 8

presents the relationship between annual
income (1970) and fertility, with age controlled. Data here are again unique since
the variation being examined is all at the
upper end of the income distribution
($7,000 or more). Previous studies (Farley, 1970) for example, have lumped all
blacks earning “five thousand dollars or
more” into one category. Table 8 shows
that when only high income black professionals are examined, the inverse relationship between income and fertility is not
obtained. An interesting pattern, however,
does emerge with regard to childlessness.
Farley (1970) has reported that childlessness was not linked to socioeconomic
variables in any systematic manner. That

is, in 1960, the proportion of black wives
who were childless was pretty much the
same regardless of the husband’s income
(about 18-20%). For the present sample,
about this level of childlessness is maintained for incomes of less than $17,000 in
1970. A fairly sharp drop in childlessness,
however, is noted for those black professionals earning more than $17,000 dollars.
Less than 12% of those couples earning
$25,000 or more were childless, a rate considerably lower than the general black
population in 1960 (19%). It is not known
if a comparable drop in childlessness exists
for whites with incomes exceeding $17,000
since the top category for census tabulations is “$15,000 and over.”

RELIGION

Three-fourths of the black doctorates in
the sample were affiliated with Protestant
religions. The effect of religion on fertility
was examined in Table 9 by comparing

sionals, the median number of children was
found to be 0.38 of a child greater for
Catholics than for Protestants. Further,
Catholics were much more likely to have
large families of five or more children
(13%) than any other religious affiliation
represented (3-4%).

DISCUSSION

This investigation into the fertility of a
national sample of black doctorates has
provided fairly strong, although indirect,
support for the notion that black professionals, like their white counterparts, consciously limit fertility (upward mobility
hypothesis). Although direct evidence of
this link is not provided, the lower fertility
of black professionals compared with other
blacks and whites is clear. Black professionals in the sample averaged 1.76 children, almost one full child less than blacks
in general (0.73 of a child). Childlessness
was found to be greater among black pro

sample with census tabulations involve
several limitations that should be mentioned. First, ever-married black doctorates
of both sexes are compared with evermarried women only (21% of the sample
were females). This comparison is rationalized by assuming that each male respondent
represents the fertility of his wife. The fact
that some male respondents were married
more than once may introduce some distortion, but this problem is believed to be
slight.

A second and perhaps more severe limitation involves the ages of both samples.
Black doctorates in the sample vary in age
from 25 to 83 years, whereas census data
report age-specific fertility on women between the ages of 15 and 44 years only.
Almost three-fourths of the total sample in
the present study are over 44 years of age.

Third, fertility data collected from April
through June of 1970 (black doctorates)
are compared with January 1969 data for
all blacks and all whites. Although more
recent census data are available, the January 1969 data were used due to their
greater proximity in time to the present
study and the fact that the two census reports did not vary a great deal.}?

Finally, the problem of external validity
in the present study should be mentioned.

12 Both census reports were collected about fifteen months from the present study. Percentage
distribution on children ever born for black
women between 15-44 years are as follows:

January 1969 June 1971

Acc ew wen ennnes 11.8 11.8

Total ........ 100.0 100.0

Although changes are small, the data do indicate
that increasing proportions of black Americans are
having two or three children (4% increase) rather
than larger or smaller families,

Social Biology

The present sample of black American doctorates, although large for this particular
universe, is a nonprobability sample. The
parameters of the universe are unknown.
Possible biases with regard to region and
age have been mentioned.!* Strong generalizations, then, to the universe of black
American doctorates would be severely constrained due to problems of possible sampling bias and the unknown status of
nonrespondents. Further, only academic
doctorates were sampled. Other black
professionals such as lawyers, physicians,
and businessmen may have yet different
fertility patterns. Nevertheless, the present

study is believed to be the first intensive
investigation into the fertility of a fairly
large sample of black professionals of any
kind.

Hopefully, further studies can take these
methodological problems into account. Future studies are needed also to explore the
degree to which relationships examined
here are “attenuated.” The degree of attenuation has remained problematic since comparable data for all blacks on these same
relationships were not obtained.
