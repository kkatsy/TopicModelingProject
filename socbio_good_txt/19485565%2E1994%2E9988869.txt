Sexual Activity of Women in Taiwan

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we calculate a base line of statistical data on the frequency of sexual
activity at various ages of Taiwanese women. A cross-sectional study using questionnaires
administered during personal interviews was conducted on more than seventeen thousand
women who attended family planning clinics in the Taipei metropolitan area in 1991 and 1992.
Of the women surveyed, 2.8 per cent were sexually inactive in the previous month, 83.67 per cent
had intercourse one to nine times in the previous month, and 13.56 per cent had intercourse ten
times or more. The mean frequency of sexual activity was 6.8 times a month. Age-specific mean
coital frequencies for the age groups of less than 25 years, of 25-34 years, and of 35-44 years
were 10.3, 7.3, and 6.6 times per month, respectively. Increased sexual frequency was associated
with the following factors: young age, unmarried, lower educational level, fewer years of
marriage and being on the pill. When logistic regression was used to control for confounding
variables, we found that a woman’s age is the most significant factor in predicting her sexual

frequency.

Sexual activity may be the most central of all human activities. It is also
important to a number of medical and
social issues (Smith, 1991), such as sexually transmitted diseases, abortion,
contraception, reproductive problems,
marital difficulties, and divorce. Information about sexual activity is essential
for dealing with these issues, yet accurate information on means of women’s
sexual activity remains incomplete
(Mulligan et al., 1991). Udry and Morris (1982) conducted a study on married American white women between
the ages of 15 and 44 in 1974 and found
a mean sexual frequency of 9.5 times
per month. Data on Thai women
(Udry et al., 1982), based on interviews conducted with a sample of 900
currently married women between the
ages of 15 and 44 in an area just outside
Bangkok in 1969, showed a mean Sexual frequency of 6.4 times per month.
In a Japanese study (Udry et al., 1982)
conducted on 1,020 married female pa
tients under the age of 45 at eight hospitals in Tokyo and Yokohama between 1975 and 1976 mean sexual
frequency was 8.3 times per month.
Unfortunately, data from the above
three nations may not be applicable to
older or unmarried women, because
they are based only on married participants under the age of 45.

Since there had not been any systematic and scientific research on the
sexual activity of women in Taiwan,
our country has called for a base line,
or standard data for the comparison of
the sexual frequency of various ages of
women. In order to acquire such data,
a large scale cross-sectional survey was
conducted in the metropolitan area of
Taipei between 1991 and 1992. This paper attempts to provide information on
the contemporary evaluation of sexual
frequency among Taiwanese women as
well as to delineate social and demographic characteristics related to differences in sexual frequency.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The study used questionnaires administered during personal interviews
with 17,047 consecutive women who
visited family planning clinics at twelve
local health centers in the metropolitan
area of Taipei between July 1991 and
December 1992. Contents of the questionnaire included demographic and
social data, focusing especially on reproductive history and sexual behavior. The data on the frequency of intercourse were collected through a
question which asked each woman to
report how many times she and her
sexual partner had intercourse in the
previous month.

Women interviewed ranged from 16
to 92 years with an average age of 35.24
years. Of the 17,047 women, 15,249
were married, 1,108 were unmarried,
298 were widowed, and 392 were divorced or separated.

Interviewers were public health
nurses at the twelve local health centers in the Taipei area who received a
minimum of eight hours of training
about the data collection and interviewing techniques. One of the authors
(Wang) supervised the work to ensure

‘the consistency of the interviews.

Using a SAS package, we analyzed
how sexual frequency varied with social and demographic characteristics.
The major factors included in the anal
_ ysis were age, ethnicity, current mari
tal status, duration of marriage, and
contraceptive methods. By logistic regression, we controlled for confounding variables and determined which
factors were important in explaining
sexual frequency. In addition, we used
the .Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test
for trends, when applicable.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows sexual frequency during the one month prior to the interview. The mean number of acts was
6.8. Among the women interviewed,
2.8 per cent were sexually inactive;
83.64 per cent had intercourse 1 to 9
times in the previous month; and 13.56
per cent had intercourse 10 times or
more in the previous month. As was
expected, sexual frequency varied in
direct relation to age. For example,
women who had intercourse once or
more during the previous month segmented by age as follows: under 25
years old, 99.65 per cent; ages 35-39,
98.94 per cent; ages 45-49, 94.75 per
cent; ages 55-59, 68.15 per cent; ages
60-64, 58.6 per cent; and ages 65 and
over, 40 per cent.

A more marked difference in sexual
activity between different age groups is
apparent for those having intercourse
10 times or more during the month: under 25 years old, 38.02 per cent; ages
35-39, 10.47 per cent; ages 50-54, 5.55
per cent. While the per cent is practically nil for 10 times a month for
women aged 65 and older, 40 per cent
of women in the 65 and older age group
were still having intercourse, although
at varying frequencies.

By 45-49 years of age, about 5 per
cent of women had become sexually
inactive, and by ages 50-54, 12.21 per
cent were inactive. This proportion
rose to 31.85 per cent in women 55-59
years old, and to 41.40 per cent in
women 60-64 years old. About 60 per
cent of women more than 65 years old
had no sexual activity. Both the differences and the trends were significant at
P<0.0001.

reported a slightly higher sexual frequency than women in urban areas, on
average, but this relationship is not significant. There was also not any difference in sexual frequency by ethnicity.
In this study population, 64.55 per
cent of widowed women were sexually
inactive, as were 21.28 per cent of divorced or separated women. Women
who had intercourse ten or more times
in the previous month represented only
9.88 per cent of married women, but
54.15 per cent of unmarried women
and 38.91 per cent of separated or
divorced women. The percentage of
women who had coitus frequently was
actually higher among unmarried
women than among married women.
However, a far higher percentage of
married women (88.18 per cent) than
of unmarried women (35.47) had sexual intercourse 1-9 times in the previous month. Few married women had
been abstinent (1.94 per cent). The difference was significant at P< 0.0001.
Education level was also related to
coital frequency. Few women in the
“college & over” group had been sexually inactive (1.14 per cent). In fact, a
very high percentage of the “‘college &
over” group (89.36 per cent) had sexual intercourse 1-9 times. The difference is significant at P< 0.0001.
Within our survey, occupational status had little apparent bearing on sexual activity. Employed and unemployed women participated in coitus to
a comparable degree. However, no
clerical workers had been abstinent
during this period, and a much higher
percentage of clerical workers (14.08
per cent) had coitus 10 or more times.
The difference is significant at
P<0.01. This finding may be due in

Social Biology

part to our study with a sample of
17,047 women, where small differences in coital frequency are statistically significant.

There is a fairly regular decline in
the frequency of intercourse by the duration of marriage, from 7.8 acts per
month among those in the first year of
marriage to 3.7 acts among those married for more than 26 years. Both these
differences and trends are significant
(P < 0.0001).

It will be noted that average coital
frequency is associated with the contraceptive method. The highest frequencies are reported by women who are
using the pill or sterilization method,
whereas the lowest frequencies are associated with the use of the rhythm
method (P < 0.0001).

Table 2 presents the logistic regression analysis, which indicates that
women’s age, marital status, years of
marriage, educational attainment, and
contraceptive method all independently affect the frequency of intercourse. In particular, women’s age is
the most important contributor to the
decline in frequency of intercourse
(P < 0.0001).

DISCUSSION

Our data show that, on average,
women under the age of 45 reported
engaging in sexual intercourse 7.2
times in the preceding month, and
that the age-specific mean frequencies
for the age groups of 25 years and
younger, 25 to 34 years, and 35 to 44
years were 10.3, 7.3, and 6.6 times
per month, respectively. These agespecific mean frequencies are moderate figures when compared with those

effects and cohort effects absolutely. It
is well established that sexual frequency roughly halves between the
ages of 20 and 40. The decline has been
attributed by Kinsey et al. (1953) to
waning physiological capacity, and this
view was also supported by Runciman
(1981), Udry et al. (1978), and Udry
(1980). However this point has been
challenged by Persky et al. (1978) who
reported that sexual frequency correlates with women’s testosterone level.
This idea was disputed by James (1981)
and Gartrell et al. (1977), who suggested that sexual frequency approximately halves during the first year of
marriage and then takes perhaps another 20 years to halve again. They
claimed that such a decline seems unlikely to reflect a biologically based
decline in hormone levels.

On the other hand, culture plays an
important role in shaping sexual frequency in two ways. First, marital status always affects a person’s frequency
of sexual intercourse. Second, social
conventions and accepted practices
have changed during recent generations. This change in behavior has been
accompanied by increased social acceptance of premarital sex (Greeley
et al., 1990; Niem et al., 1989; Smith,
1990). Also, the general literature on
the “sexual revolution” (Cannon and
Long, 1971; Chilan, 1978; Clayton and
Bokemeier, 1980) suggests that since
sexual behavior grew more permissive
over time, women of a younger cohort
are more sexually active than older cohorts were at the same age. These social behavior studies, when combined
with the biological and hormonal studies reviewed above, suggest that any
interpretation of the decline in sexual

Social Biology

frequency with age must be taken with
caution. However, we believe that the
most probable explanation is a combination of sociological processes interacting with biological processes to produce the observed patterns.

Coital frequency was also found to
be higher among women with less educational attainment and among those
who are likely to want considerably
more children. In contrast, the cause of
the apparent decline among those
whose educational attainment was college or more was that they intended to
have no more children (Westoff, 1974).
These results remained relatively unaffected when we adjusted for age. In addition, it is often presumed that women
who are engaged in “physical occupations” indulge in sexual activity more
frequently than women who have
“clerical” occupations (Finkle et al.,
1959). Our data do not support this assumption. Clerical workers had a maximal frequency of 7.3 times monthly.

A factor which might influence coital frequency is the amount of interference with sexual intercourse that
the method of contraception causes.
A classification system for contraception employed by Gough (1973)
was whether the method was coitusindependent (the pill, IUD, sterilization), coitus-dependent (condom), or
coitus-inhibiting (rhythm, — withdrawal). This classification produced
some illuminating results. The highest
frequencies occurred in pill users (9.4
acts), and the lowest frequencies in
rhythm users (5.8 acts). Users of
coitus-independent methods reported
higher-than-average coital frequencies
with the single exception of users of
IUD’s who reported a lower coital

frequency (6.3 acts). This finding is influenced by the fact that Taiwanese
women electing the IUD method
tended to be in the older, married
group (Wang, ms.).
