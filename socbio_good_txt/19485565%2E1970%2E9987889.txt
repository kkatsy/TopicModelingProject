Reed (19698) has reviewed studies which
attempt to estimate the amount (Af) of
Caucasian gene flow to American Negro
populations, These studies provide information about the genetic heterogeneity among
various populations, and M values for different loci may indicate genes which have
been subject to the action of natural selection during the past 250 to 350 years (Hertzog and Johnston, 1968; Reed, 19695, 1970;
Workman, 1968, 1970; Workman et al.,
1963). The basic argument for detection of
selection by comparison of M values for different loci is that although selection pressures may be too weak to be detected with
data covering only two generations, directional changes in gene frequencies accumulated over 10 generations or so should be
detectable.

Both Reed and Workman as well as
Hertzog and Johnston have discussed the
problems inherent in the genetic data and in
the statistics of estimation. Their discussions should be consulted for details and
criticisms (see References at end of article).
I will summarize some of the results in order

to indicate the complexity of population
structure which one attempts to describe by
the single statistic,

M = (Gn - ga) / (Ge — qa) ’

where g, represents the frequency of a given
gene in the African ancestral population, g,
is the frequency in the ancestral Caucasian
population, and gn is the frequency in a
present-day American Negro population.
Thus, M is a measure of total Caucasian
admixture for a given gene in a specified
hybrid population of biracial origin. Most
studies are concerned primarily with static
and historical aspects of hybridization (with
the exception of studies attempting to detect
the operation of natural selection); few admixture studies emphasize the rate of racial
intermixture and the establishment of dynamic equilibria (see, for example, Glass and
Li, 1953; Roberts, 1955; Roberts and
Hiorns, 1962).

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT GENETIC STRUCTURE
OF HYBRID POPULATIONS

One of the basic assumptions inherent in
any attempt to describe the genetic structure of a hybrid population as the result
solely of intermixture or of both intermix

Vol. 17, No. 4

ture and selection is that the ethnic compositions of the ancestral populations are
known. Basically, the equation for M given
above describes the situation wherein only
two genetically different populations have
contributed to the formation of the hybrid
population, and gene flow is in one direction
only. In the present case it is assumed that
gene flow has been unidirectional from Caucasian to American Negro populations.
With regard to the probability of triracial origin of United States Negro populations, Herskovits (1930), on the basis of
limited information reported in genealogical
questionnaires, concluded that a significant
proportion of American Negroes had some
American Indian ancestry. However, Glass
(1955) was unable to demonstrate any significant proportion of American Indian admixture in blood group samples composed
predominantly (or exclusively) of urban Negroes. As Glass pointed out, this is not surprising under the assumptions of an originally small contribution of Indian genes and
no differential fitness in favor of IndianNegro matings and their descendants. Herskovits (1930, p. 41) recognized that “‘crossing with the Indians is a matter of some
generations ago, and today is an exceptional
occurrence.” Pollitzer (1958) commented
that some physical and verbal evidence for
Indian admixture exists in Negro populations surveyed in the sea-island area of
South Carolina and Georgia. Furthermore,
he noted that serological studies of tribes
most likely to have been involved in intermixture with Negroes were not available in
the 1950’s. In subsequent work, Pollitzer
(1964) has described a tri-racial isolate in
North Carolina. This group, and probably
others of this kind, consider themselves Indian rather than Negro, although estimation
of the amount of admixture from the putative contributing populations for this group
indicates more Caucasian and Negro ancestry than Indian. Thus, not only would these
isolated populations not be considered “Ne
Gene Flow

317

gro” for most studies, but they are also rare
today and quickly dissolving.

Undoubtedly there was gene flow from
Indians as well as Caucasians to some American Negro groups. The fact that the American Indian component is not detectable in
any given Negro sample is partly a reflection
of true historical] differences in the genetic
composition of various hybrid populations,
of difficulties in detection of a small amount
of gene flow, and of difficulties defining and
obtaining samples from the correct ancestral
components. Furthermore, genetic samples
of Caucasians, Indians, and Negroes are
rarely, if ever, mutually exclusive with regard to the allelic states at any given locus.
Finally, it must be pointed out that almost
all of the studies of North American Negro
populations tacitly assume the absence of
gene flow from American Indians.

Given the model of bi-racial origin of
American Negro populations, Pollitzer
(1958) and Reed (19690) have used information on the distribution of slaves from the
major slave-trading areas to attempt a reconstruction of the ethnic composition of
the African ancestral component. Coupled
with the assumption that gene frequencies in
present-day African populations in the slaving areas have not changed, mean gene frequencies can be obtained weighted by the
proportionate contribution to the slave
trade. In order to obtain estimates of the
gene frequencies in the ancestral Caucasian
component, it must also be assumed that
these frequencies are the same as in presentday descendants. It has been pointed out to
me by Pollitzer (personal communication)
that knowledge about the ethnic composition of slaves imported to the United States
is applicable with confidence only to Negro
populations with a long history of residence
in the Charleston, South Carolina, area. In
other words, we know little about the actual
ethnic composition of the African component for Negro groups which have had a long

history of residence in other areas of the
United States.

An additional set of assumptions must be
met which requires that the samples be
drawn from the correct present-day descendants of ancestral Caucasian and African
populations, and from the Negro population
under study; and that these samples be
unbiased and with as small standard errors
of gene frequencies as possible. Both Glass
(1955) and Reed (19698) have excluded certain series of American Negro blood-group
samples on the basis that they were biased
by attempts of the investigators to preferentially include individuals of darker skin
color and/or exclude individuals with physical traits indicative of white admixture (for
examples, see Table 1). Pollitzer (1958) detected an association between some morphological traits indicative of more or less negroidness and the frequency of the genes for
hemoglobins S and C, the Duffy blood

Social Biology

groups, and the B allele of the ABO blood
group system when he divided the Charleston Negro sample (composed predominantly
of Gullah Negroes) into two moieties according to morphological measures. Since even
unlinked genes can be correlated in hybrid
populations which have not reached equilibrium for gametic phase, and since the
approach to gametic phase equilibrium—
although rapid under most conditions, in the
absence of selection—is retarded by assortative mating within the population (see Crow
and Felsenstein, 1968), it is not entirely
unexpected that some Negro isolates have
yet to reach equilibrium for all gametic
combinations.

There is evidence that a complex pattern
of assortative mating has been practiced in
the past within some urban, nonsouthern
American Negro populations. From data on
the skin color of 174 pairs of husbands and
wives from the Harlem district of New York

City investigated in 1925-26, Herskovits
(1926, 1930) concluded that the darkest
women tend to marry men of their own or
lighter color while the lighter women marry
men decidedly darker than themselves.
However, the overall association which I
computed by the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient was r, = 0.43 (corrected
for tied ranks). This positive association for
skin color among Harlem couples is significant at the 0.001 level (for a two-tailed test).
Herskovits also noted positive correlations
for lip thickness (r = 0.22) and width of
nose (yr = 0.13) among these couples. However, his method used in calculating these
latter two correlations may not be entirely
valid. Pollitzer (1958) suggests that mate selection in favor of those Negroes with indications of Caucasian admixture may have operated among Negroes in close association
with a dominant white society in large numbers, whereas among Negroes long isolated
in the coastal counties of lower South Carolina, and of distinctly more negroid appearance, mate selection was against those showing signs of Caucasian admixture. This
latter process may have been strong enough
to impede Caucasian gene flow to or to lead
to differential migration of hybrids from
Negro isolates of the coastal area.

As Reed (1970) has reiterated in his reply
to comments by Workman (1970), both ethnically correct as well as statistically accurate gene frequencies are needed for proper
estimation of the amount of genetic admixture in any defined population. Glass and Li
(1953) first pointed out that one should
choose genes which exhibit the maximum
divergence in frequency between the two
putative ancestral populations in order to
reduce the standard error of the estimate M.
Furthermore, since the exact ethnic composition of the African component cannot be
known, the chosen gene should be uniformly
distributed over the entire slave-trade area.
Ideally, one would like to have a gene, selectively neutral, which can be shown to be

absent or rare in the ancestral African populations which contributed slaves to the New
World, but common in Caucasians. The Gm
alleles Gm!, Gm?®, and Gm5 may be of this
type (Reed, 19692), An even stronger case
has been made for the Fy* gene of the Duffy
blood group system (Reed, 19690). Workman (1968, 1970) has argued that it is
mainly the consistency of the magnitude of
M values among different Negro samples
which indicates those genes which may have
been subject to stronger or weaker selection.
Furthermore, there is corroboration from
other lines of evidence to suggest that some
of the genes detected by this method are
under the action of natural selection.

It is curious, however, that although effort and discussion have been devoted to
obtaining reliable African and American Negro gene frequencies little has been said
about the accuracy of gene frequencies used
in representing the ancestral Caucasian component. Surely most of the gene flow must
have occurred early in the history of rural
Negro populations. Nevertheless, inspection
of early censuses of the United States by
state and by country of origin suggests a
large degree of variation in European origin
of nineteenth-century residents of the
United States. To what extent this heterogeneity extended further into the past and
to what extent it represents effective genetic
heterogeneity with respect to admixture
with African slaves and American Negroes
probably cannot be determined (see Roberts, 1955).

It is necessary to consider, then, that the
genetic heterogeneity as revealed by estimates of gene flow among various United
States Negro populations represents different histories of amounts of admixture with a
Caucasian gene pool as well as the operation
of other evolutionary factors which have
modified the genetic composition of the
hybrid populations, With regard to the last
point, one must recognize the possibility of
founder effects occasioned by the extreme

mortality suffered by slaves prior to their
arrival in the United States and by their
segregation into more or less isolated populations on large plantations in the South.

GENETIC HETEROGENEITY AMONG
HYBRID POPULATIONS

Estimates of the total amount of Caucasian admixture in different American Negro samples reviewed by Reed (19695) are
not strictly comparable with regard to
sample size, chosen gene, and estimated ancestral gene frequencies. Nevertheless, two
patterns of consistency emerge which have
biological significance. First of all, some authors have suggested that higher than average M values, of the order of 0.34 to 0.70,
indicate the operation of natural selection on
the gene in question. Thus, Workman (1968;
Workman et al., 1963) was able to conclude
that there is evidence for selection acting
against the T, Tf?!, Hb8, Hb°, Hp’, and G6-PD deficiency genes and the A; allele (of
the ABO system) in United States Negro
populations. In addition, M values indicate
that selection has acted in favor of the Ag
allele of the ABO blood groups and against
the Gc? gene in American Negro groups, and
that it is the haptoglobin subtype Hp'¥
which is under strong selective pressures.
Hertzog and Johnston (1968) using a simiJar approach conclude that there is evidence
for strong selection favoring the Rh-negative gene, r, which is more than enough to
offset the effects of incompatibility selection.

The second pattern, which is most obvious among the series of genes other than
those just mentioned, is the smaller average
M values (0.04 to 0.12) for various southern
samples as compared to higher M values
(0.13 to 0.31) for nonsouthern, urban samples. Estimates of the maximum MM derived
from the frequency of the Fy gene in three
nonsouthern samples, presumably unbiased,
yield values in the range of 0.189-0.260;
while the predominantly Gullah Negro sample from Charleston, South Carolina, pro
Social Biology

vided M = 0.037 and another, less isolated,
group sampled from this area yielded M =
0.106 (Table 1). The same Caucasian frequency of the Fy* gene—that of Oakland
Whites provided by Reed (1968) and equal
to 0.4286—was used in all of these estimates. Furthermore, since the ancestral
African gene frequency was assumed to be
zero, the formula for M reduces to M =
Qn/ deo

The low estimates of Caucasian admixture for both series from the Charleston,
South Carolina, area accord well with comparisons based on anthropometric data. Furthermore, the Gullah isolate also evinces a
linguistic distinctiveness akin to languages
of West Africa. Pollitzer (1958) has also
noted the survival of magic and other practices from West Africa among the coastal
Negroes. The predominantly Gullah sample
from Charleston is not only closer biologically to African populations but is also qualitatively different from other American Negro samples from outside of the Charleston
area. Pollitzer concludes that differences in
ancestral components as well as in the degree of Caucasian admixture are responsible
for the divergence of Charleston from other
American Negroes. It is also probable that
genetic drift has played a role in contributing to the variation of gene frequencies
among various Negro populations in the
Charleston area (Pollitzer et al., 1964).

FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO
GENETIC VARIATION

Differences in the amount of Caucasian
admixture must be the major factor responsible for the regional variation in M values
demonstrated for United States Negroes.
However, it was also suggested that various
American Negro populations may well have
differed in the genetic composition of the
ancestral African and Caucasian components. For example, with respect to African
mean gene frequencies for alleles of the ABO
blood group system which is polymorphic in

Vol. 17, No. 4

the seven major slaving areas, Reed (19695)
concludes that there is an overall uniformity. It is possible that considerable variation
existed at the tribal or intratribal level within each of these regions and that this heterogeneity of subpopulations would not be apparent at the level of inter-regional comparisons. In order to illustrate these points, the
amount of differentiation of tribal samples
for certain loci was computed and the results are presented in Table 2.

Variation in gene frequencies in a large
population which is subdivided can be measured by the relation

b= Lwi(pix — px)?
P(l — px)

for the &-th allele at a given polymorphic
locus where w,; is the contribution of the 7-th
isolate to the total population. Nei (1965)
shows that for the case of a di-allelic locus,
¢, is identical with Wright’s (1951) inbreeding coefficient, Fsr, which measures the
amount of differentiation of subpopulations.
Yasuda (1968) suggested combining the ¢;

321

into a single measure, ¢, for a given multiple
allelic locus according to the relation

d = Zprdx 
Additional weighted or unweighted measures have been given by Li (1969), and
Workman (1969) has given some valuable
comments basic to the construction and interpretation of such measures (see also
Morton, 1969).

Data on tribal differentiation for different
African regions and for certain Joc} given in
Table 2 refer to groups which are either
within or outside of the major slave trade
areas. The Liberian and Nigerian tribes did
contribute significantly to the slave trade.
By comparison, the ¢azo value calculated
from seven surveys of the major slaving
areas is 0.002 and therefore considerably
smaller than the intertribal values. The apparent uniformity over the larger regions
may be a spurious result of combining heterogeneous samples into larger categories
and obscures the variation which exists at
the level of local populations. Morton (1969,

p. 69) has concluded from studies on two
different major hybrid populations and the
descendants of their ancestral populations
that “polymorphisms are more sensitive to
local selection, and therefore on the average
over a large area or long period of time
closer to neutrality, than are idiomorphs.”’
Clearly, the larger ¢ values for the HbS gene
reflect the ecological heterogeneity of the
primary selective agent, malaria and its
vector, and the dynamics of gene flow for
this balanced polymorphism in West Africa
(see Allison, 1964).

It is doubtful that the procurement of
Africans for the slave trade was operated on
the basis of random sampling of individuals
within a very large major region. Probably
sampling was closer to the level of the tribe
with entire villages or subtribes being captured. Additionally, related individuals and
groups suffered together the same dire circumstances of transportation to the New
World and high mortality. Thus, from all of
these causes combined, a sufficient amount
of variation in gene frequencies was already
available among the Africans arriving at
different times for the formation of different
Negro populations. The slave trade had a
long history, on the order of two hundred
years. It is doubtful that the slave owners in
the United States were able to effect the
formation of various Negro populations
which were not biased genetically by the
method of procurement of slaves and temporal heterogeneity of ethnic composition.

SUMMARY

A review of basic assumptions and results
of studies designed to estimate the total

Social Biology

amount of Caucasian admixture in various
populations of United States Negroes and
for different genes illustrates a large degree
of genetic heterogeneity among the various
samples. Most of this variation can be attributed to differences in the degree of Caucasian admixture where the studies have
satisfied certain criteria of historical, ethnic,
and statistical nature. Also, there is evidence
to suggest that sufficient variation of gene
frequencies existed among African tribal
units to contribute to variation among ancestral components for the formation of
different hybrid populations.

Intertribal differentiation for a strongly
selected gene like that for sickle-cell hemoglobin in African samples is shown to be
greater than that for some blood group
genes. Founder effects and other types of
sampling biases may have played important
roles in the sampling of polymorphic loci
subject to strong local selective pressures
in Old World populations. Thus, although
not conclusive, comparisons of the magnitudes of the estimates of Caucasian gene
flow for different genes suggest that the following genes have been selected against in
United States Negro populations: T, Tf,
Hb8, Hb°, Hp!, G-6-PD-, A;, and possibly
Gc*, Similar evidence exists for strong selection in favor of the Rh-negative gene, r.
