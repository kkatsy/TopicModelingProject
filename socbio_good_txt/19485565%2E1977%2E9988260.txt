ABSTRACT: The authors criticize past studies for concluding that the relationship between socioeconomic status and infant mortality has declined in modern industrial societies to the degree that
it is almost nonexistent. Such studies computed infant death rates utilizing small numbers of
births and deaths, resulting in unreliable rates. In this study, social area analysis is employed in a
fairly large city with vital data from the early 1970’s. The findings indicate a rather strong
relationship still exists between SES and infant mortality. Limitations of social area analysis are
discussed, and suggestions for future research are given.

The infant mortality rate in the United
States has declined steadily from 99.9 per
1,000 live births in 1915 to an estimated
rate of 16.1 in 1975 (Bogue, 1959, Tables
9-17; U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1976, Table 6).
Conflicting evidence exists, however, regarding the degree to which this reduction
has characterized all socioeconomic
groups and the degree to which an inverse
association between socioeconomic status
and infant mortality still holds in modern
industrial societies such as the United
States. While some recent evidence still
supports the existence of a strong inverse
association (Brooks, 1975a, 1975b, U.S.
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare, 1972, 1975; Shapiro et al., 1968),
some studies have argued that the relationship has been steadily declining to the
degree that it is virtually nonexistent.

The principal argument offered in support of a declining association between
socioeconomic status (SES) and infant
mortality has been centered around the
rapidity of the decline in infant mortality

in the twentieth century and the accompanying shift that has taken place in the
relative importance of the neonatal and
postneonatal components of infant mortality. While, for example, neonatal
deaths (infant deaths occurring during the
first 27 days of life) represented about 44
per cent of all infant deaths in 1915; in 1971
they represented about 74 per cent. In
other words, the proportion of postneonatal deaths (deaths occurring at the
ages of 28 days to 364 days) has dropped
from 56 per cent to only 26 per cent during
this period (Brooks, 1975a, p. 291). As the
argument goes, one would expect a decline
in the inverse association between SES
and total infant mortality since the association has historically worked primarily
through postneonatal mortality (Donabedian et al., 1965, p. 1084). Stockwell
(1962, p. 108) notes that deaths occurring
during the neonatal period are primarily
caused by biological rather than socioeconomic factors, while postneonatal deaths
are more sensitive to socioeconomic differentials since they are removed from

38

Vol. 24, No. 1 Infant Mortality and
the “physiological processes of gestation
and birth.” Since the postneonatal rate is
such a small part of the total infant rate
and most deaths are therefore related to
biological rather than socioeconomic factors, it would not be surprising to find a
rather weak (or nonexistent) association
between SES and total infant mortality in
a modern industrial society such as the
United States (Stockwell, 1962, p. 111).

There have been primarily two important studies offering the above argument
to explain their findings of a weak association between total infant mortality and
SES. Both studies employed social area
analysis with data on census tracts in
middle-sized Northeastern cities. Willie
(1959) analyzed infant mortality data for
the years 1950-56 on 59 tracts in Syracuse,
New York; Stockwell (1962) examined, in
a similar manner, data for the years
1949-5 1 on 36 tracts in Providence, Rhode
Island. Both studies employed socioeconomic measures on census tracts from the
1950 census of population.

In a recent study, Brooks (19755, p.
292) has criticized both Willie and
Stockwell for concluding that the historical association between SES and infant
mortality has been on the decline mainly
because they did not analyze historical
data directly. In his study, Brooks employs a path analysis model with data on
states for 1938 and 1968 and finds no support for the hypothesis of a declining relationship. While Brooks’ criticism deserves
some merit, he still fails to comment on the
lack of a significant association found by
the two studies. Part of the purpose of this
study is to investigate that question. Do the
findings of the two studies represent the
actual situation in Syracuse and Providence, or do they perhaps reflect weak
methodological procedures? We believe
that the latter is probably the case. We
think that both Willie and Stockwell employed social area analysis in rather small

Socioeconomic Status 39
areas, thus rendering their calculated infant mortality rates quite unstable, especially when broken into their neonatal and
postneonatal components. We believe that
this method can be useful only if employed
in rather large cities where the tract groupings by SES provide a large enough number of live births (and infant deaths) for
the calculation of meaningful infant death
rates.

We would also like to emphasize that
the utility of social area analysis is still
limited even when used with data from
large cities. First, it always entails the risk
of an “ecological fallacy”; second, it does
not permit multivariate analysis of infant
mortality rates. If a variable in addition to
SES is introduced, for example, the subsequent calculation of rates becomes less
stable since they are measured with fewer
deaths and births. This is a serious limitation given the development and refinement of multivariate techniques during
the last two decades. In other words, infant mortality differentials can be better
investigated employing such multivariate
techniques as multiple regression and path
analysis.

Before we dismiss social area analysis,
however, we would like to demonstrate
that when it is employed in a rather large
city, a strong relationship between SES
and infant mortality can still be found despite an inability to control adequately for
other factors. In order to examine this hypothesis, we chose San Antonio, Texas, a
large city with a 1970 population of
654,153 (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1972, Table P-1). Infant mortality rates
analyzed are for the five-year period of
1970-74, approximately two decades later
than the data used by both Willie and
Stockwell. If one notes the fact that sharp
declines in infant mortality have taken
place during these two decades, then following Willie’s and Stockwell’s reasoning
and conclusions one would expect us to

find even weaker associations between
SES and infant mortality in the 1970’s.
Our findings are presented below after a
brief description of our data and methods.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

After excluding census tracts not
primarily in the city of San Antonio, we
analyzed data on 115 tracts which include
almost all of San Antonio’s population. In
a somewhat similar manner to that of
Willie and Stockwell, we ranked the census tracts according to three socioeconomic variables using a modified version
of an index supplied by Shevky and Bell
(1955).

The three variables we chose from the
1970 census are: median family income,
median number of years of school completed by persons 25 years old and over,
and the percentage of persons 16 years old
and over who were professionals, technicians, and kindred workers, managers and
administrators (except farm), and sales,
clerical, and kindred workers. Pearson’s
zero order correlations between the three
variables indicate that they are highly intercorrelated: for income-education, r =
0.76; for income-occupation, 7 = 0.82;
and for education-occupation, r = 0.89.
While data on other indicators of SES are
published, we felt that an index capturing
income, education, and occupation is conceptually more meaningful.

The 115 census tracts were ranked on
each variable according to the formula Xv
— Iv /Hv — Lv X 100, where Xv is the
census tract value of each of the three SES
variables, and Hv and Lv are the highest
and lowest value of each variable among
all 115 tracts. The resulting three scores
for each census tract were subsequently
added and divided by three in order to
yield a composite score of census tract
SES. This method of ranking census tracts
assigns equal weight to each of the three
SES variables. The scores yielded by the

index may range from 0 to 100. The 115
tracts were then divided into four socioeconomic groupings: High (scores 75-100),
Medium-high (scores 50-74), Medium-low
(scores 25-49), and Low (scores 0-24).
With this division, 21 tracts fall in the
High group, 30 in the Medium-high, 44 in
the Medium-low, and 20 in the Low
group.

Data on infant deaths and live births by
census tract were obtained from the usual
official sources for the years 1970-74. We
felt that using a five-year period would
make our calculated infant death rates
more stable. After adding all live births
and all infant deaths for each of the four
SES groups, we calculated, in the usual
manner, three measures of infant mortality for each group: total infant mortality
rate (deaths at ages 0-364 days/number of
live births X 1,000), neonatal infant mortality rate (deaths at ages 0-27 days/live
births xX 1,000), and postneonatal infant
mortality rate (deaths at ages 28-364
days/live births X 1,000). The results are
presented below.

RESULTS

The three calculated infant mortality
rates for each of the four SES groups of
census tracts are presented in Table 1. In
addition to the calculated rates, Table 1
presents the number of deaths along with
the number of live births during the fiveyear period by SES group. The data show
a definite relationship between the total
infant mortality rate and SES. The rate
rises steadily from a low of 13.8 for the
High SES group to about 20.8 for the Low
SES group. While the relationship between neonatal mortality and SES is not
as strong, it still exists. The strongest relationship is found between SES and postneonatal mortality; the postneonatal rate
rises from 2.3 to 6.3 as SES decreases.
This stronger relationship between postneonatal mortality and SES gives support

to the hypothesis that postneonatal mortality is more sensitive to socioeconomic
status variations (Stockwell, 1962, p. 106).
However, as previously mentioned, our
findings also indicate the existence of a
strong relationship between tota] infant
mortality and SES, and a mild relationship between neonatal mortality and SES.

In order to shed additional light on our
findings, we calculated infant death rates
for groups of census tracts delineated by
each of the three SES variables separately.
The calculated rates for the various groups
of tracts are shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4
along with the number of deaths and live
births in each group.

The data for the census tract groups
according to the individual variables indicate that all three infant mortality rates
are more sensitive to income differentials
than to occupational or educational differentials of census tracts. The relationships
with “occupation” and “education,” while

they do not disappear, seem much less
clear than the relationships with “income.” This is evidence supporting the
suggestion by both Willie and Stockwell
that income seems to be the most important socioeconomic variable related to
infant mortality (Willie, 1959, p. 227;
Stockwell, 1962, p. 110).

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Total, neonatal, and postneonatal infant
mortality rates were calculated for four socloeconomic status groups of census tracts
delineated by a composite index for San
Antonio, Texas for the years 1970-74. The
data indicate a strong relationship between SES and total infant mortality and
an even stronger one between SES and
postneonatal mortality. Neonatal mortality was also found to be related to SES,
but only mildly. When the census tracts
were separated by the three individual

variables comprising the composite index,
it was found that infant mortality rates
were much more sensitive to income differentials than to occupational and educational differentials.

We believe that our findings of strong
negative relationships between socioeconomic status and infant mortality indicate
that, despite improvements in medical science and public health, much tmprovement can still be made. We also believe
that both Willie (1959) and Stockwell
(1962), who utilized data about two decades earlier than ours, were premature in
concluding that medical and helath improvements have made socioeconomic
variations in infant mortality virtually
nonexistent. Their findings of weak associations refiect, we believe, the application of their methods to rather small cities.

When small cities are divided into four
or five socioeconomic areas, the numbers of
live births (and of infant deaths) occurring
in each area are too small to permit the
calculation of reliable infant death rates,

especially when such death rates are broken into smaller components. An example
is Willie’s calculation of a postneonatal
mortality rate for a socioeconomic group
of tracts with a total of only 646 live
births and just 5 deaths (1959, Table 5).
Stockwell does not publish numbers of
births and deaths by socioeconomic area,
but a similar situation is likely to have
existed, especially since he computed rates
for only a three-year period. The unreliability of their computed rates, we believe,
is the cause of their findings and not improvements in medicine and public health.
It should be noted that both Willie and
Stockwell computed infant mortality rates
for individual tracts and subsequently correlation coefficients as part of their analysis. However, census tracts are much too
small to permit calculation of meaningful
rates. These methodological problems do
not seem to have been discussed in the
literature during the many years since the
publication of their studies.

Vol. 24, No. 1 Infant Mortality and
about two decades later would not have
been expected if Willie’s and Stockwell’s
conclusions had been correct. Our findings, of course, refer to one city. But
other studies, such as Brooks’ two recent
papers using states and counties as units of
observation, have found strong relationships between socioeconomic differentials
and infant mortality.

A further comment regarding our analysis is required. San Antonio is a city with
a very large minority of Mexican Americans. We computed the proportion of persons of Spanish surname or language for
the four SES groups. As expected, this
proportion rises from 16.9 per cent in the
High SES group, to 37.7 per cent in the
Medium-high, 60.0 per cent in the
Medium-low, and 92.9 per cent in the
Low SES group. The question arises of
whether Mexican Americans experience
higher infant death rates than Anglos regardless of their SES. We computed separate total infant death rates for the period
1970-72 for persons of Spanish surname
and for Anglos in San Antonio, which are
19.0 and 17.4 respectively. This relatively
small difference leads us to suspect that
Mexican Americans, unlike Blacks, do not
experience higher rates of infant loss when
SES is controlled. The difference in the
rates can be attributed to their lower SES
as the previously mentioned relationship
between the percentage of persons of
Spanish surname or language and SES of
census tract groups indicates.

While we believe that there is no inde
43

Socioeconomic Status

pendent effect of ethnicity on infant mortality in San Antonio, one should introduce ethnicity as a variable before this fact
can be clearly established. This point
brings us to one of the serious limitations
of social area analysis of infant mortality.
The introduction of another variable, such
as the percentage of Mexican Americans,
would require calculation of rates with
much smaller numbers of births and
deaths, thus rendering those rates much
less stable. While this limitation of social
area analysis does not seem to influence
the relationship between SES and infant
mortality in San Antonio, it could pose a
serious problem for studies in other cities
with a large proportion of Blacks. The
possible contaminating effect of this variable was not examined by Stockwell (1962)
and Willie (1959) in Providence and Syracuse.

We hope to have demonstrated that social area analysis of infant mortality is
rather weak methodologically. While it
can have some utility in some cases, its
serious problems limit its utility in most
urban areas. Infant mortality differentials
can better be studied from a multivariate
and multistage perspective following
Brooks’ examples (Brooks, 1975a, 19750).
