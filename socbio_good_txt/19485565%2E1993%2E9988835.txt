Marital Assortment and Phenotypic
Convergence: Longitudinal Evidence

ABSTRACT: This study provides a direct test of whether the observed similarity of spouses is due
to initial assortment rather than to convergence of phenotypes. With data from three well-known
longitudinal studies, phenotypic convergence is examined using both variable- and personcentered analyses. The longitudinal evidence does not support the hypothesis that couples
increasingly resemble each other with time. Spouse correlations most likely reflect initial assortment at marriage and not the convergence of phenotypes.

People tend to marry partners who
are similar to themselves. Indeed, positive marital assortment has been documented for physical characteristics,
cognitive abilities, values and _attitudes, and personality traits (Epstein
and Guttman, 1984; Jensen, 1978;
Vandenberg, 1972). Moreover, it appears that similarities between spouses
reflect active personal preferences and
are not simply the outcome of social
homogamy (Mascie-Taylor and Vandenberg, 1988).

Assortative mating has important
genetic consequences (Thiessen and
Gregg, 1980). For example, assortative
mating for a trait with a genetic component will produce a population distribution for that trait that differs from
the distribution that would obtain under conditions of random mating.

Assortative mating also has social
consequences (Mare, 1991). Thus,
even if there is no genetic component
to the traits for which there is assortative mating, couples will, on average,
differ more from other couples than
they would under conditions of random mating. Moreover, to the extent
that parent-child resemblance is re
48

lated to environmental factors associated with these traits, entire families
will differ from each other (Willerman,
1979),

Assortative mating may also have
important implications for the course
of personality development in adulthood. In particular, similarities between spouses might create an environment that reinforces initial tendencies
(Buss, 1984a). Newcomb’s classic
study of students at Bennington College provides an example of this process in the domain of attitudes. The
political liberalism acquired by the
women while at Bennington in the
1930’s was sustained over the subsequent 25 years of their lives, in part because they selected liberal friends and
husbands who continued to provide social support for their politically liberal
attitudes (Newcomb, 1943; Newcomb
et al., 1967). More recently, Caspi and
Herbener (1990) have argued that by
selecting environments that are correlated with their dispositions people
may set in motion processes of social interchange that sustain their
dispositions across time and circumstance. They demonstrated this active

genotype-environment effect (cf. Plomin et al., 1977; Scarr and McCartney,
1983) by showing that marriage to a
similar other promotes consistency in
the intraindividual organization of personality attributes across adulthood.
One problem, however, continues
to plague behavioral genetics research
on assortative mating for psychological
characteristics. Most studies measure
realized assortment—the degree of
similarity that is present after some
years of marriage—rather than initial
assortment (Price and Vandenberg,
1980). Realized assortment may reflect
initial assortment, but it may also reflect the convergence of phenotypes
during marriage as a result of reciprocal influences or of shared living
conditions and other common environmental experiences (Rowe and Plomin, 1981). In addition, the extent to
which phenotypic convergence occurs
has important methodological and conceptual implications for family studies
which investigate parent-offspring resemblance (Zonderman et al., 1977).
To date, the only information on
changes in spouse resemblance has
been obtained indirectly in crosssectional studies. In this article, we offer a more rigorous examination of
phenotypic convergence using three
longitudinal studies of marital dyads.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cross-SECTIONAL STUDIES OF
PHENOTYPIC CONVERGENCE

Previous investigations of convergence have proceeded indirectly by
asking whether couples who are married longer are more similar than those

Phenotypic Convergence

49

who have been married briefly. Price
and Vandenberg (1980) recommended
using a hierarchical multiple regression
analysis to test the hypothesis that
husband-wife pairs may resemble each
other increasingly with time. In this
procedure, years of marriage is entered
in the first step, one spouse’s score on
a given variable is entered in the second step, and the interaction term is
entered in the third step. The statistical
significance of the interaction term
provides a test of whether older couples are more or less similar to each
other than are younger couples. Convergence is indicated by a positive sign
associated with the interaction term;
divergence is indicated by a negative
sign associated with the interaction
term.

With data on their American sample, Price and Vandenberg (1980) estimated 44 such models. Only eight
variables showed convergence, and
these were confined to “plastic variables” such as time spent in social activity, and alcohol and food consumption. Buss (19845) carried out a similar
analysis with 93 married American
couples in their mid-20s to mid-30s.
Eighty-nine multiple regressions were
performed on scales from a large battery of personality tests. Significant
interaction terms were found in 13
models; of these only 2 showed convergence and the remaining 11 scales
pointed to divergence. If anything,
longer married spouses appeared to be
less similar to each other than spouses
married only briefly. However, members of this sample were relatively
young and had been married for a short
period of time. An examination of a
sample with a less restricted range
might provide more reliable evidence.

Guttman and Zohar (1987), with a
sample of 138 Israeli couples, examined the distribution of mean absolute
spouse differences with length of marriage for the seven Comrey Personality
Scale dimensions. The couples had
been married from between 1 to 22
years. There is little evidence in their
scattergrams to support the conclusion
that spouses converge (or diverge)
over the course of marriage.

To examine convergence in IQ
scores and personality traits during
marriage, Mascie-Taylor (1989) correlated the absolute difference scores between husbands and wives with years
of marriage. This analysis, carried out
with two British samples, did not provide any evidence pointing to convergence. In addition, Mascie-Taylor
(1989) performed the hierarchical regressions recommended by Price and
Vandenberg (1980) and found a significant interaction effect in only 1 of the
26 regression models examined. Finally, Watkins and Meredith (1981)
compared spouse correlations on tests
of specific cognitive abilities from their
sample of 215 newlywed spouses with
the correlations from other samples of
American couples to explore the possible effects of cohabitation on spouse
similarities. The results revealed no
consistent differences between newlyweds and couples who had been married for longer periods of time. Whatever resemblance is present in abilities
appears to be present in initial stages of
the marriage as well.

The single demonstration of phenotypic convergence has been reported in
a clever experiment. Zajonc and his
colleagues (1988) asked subjects to
judge the physical similarity of couples
on the basis of photographs taken

Caspi and Herbener

Social Biology

when the couples were first married
and again 25 years later. The results
showed that the physical resemblance
of spouses, as judged by the subjects, was significantly greater after a
quarter-century of cohabitation. Compelling though this analysis may appear, some caution ts in order for the
experiment also revealed that the
spouses, when first married, were not
perceived as more similar to each other
than randomly paired couples. This
finding contradicts Spuhler’s (1968)
data and a substantial body of social
psychological research on physical attractiveness (Berscheid, 1985).

In sum, the hypothesis that spouses
converge over the course of marriage
has received little support in crosssectional studies. It appears that initial
assortment may be the probable cause
of obtained spouse correlations. Crosssectional studies, however, provide
equivocal approximations of longitudinal trends (Nesselroade and Baltes,
1979). Thus, it remains important for
behavioral genetics analysis to determine whether spouse similarities are
due to initial assortment or to convergence over time.

We shall examine this question with
data from three well-known longitudinal studies: (1) the Kelly Longitudinal Study, (2) the Berkeley Guidance
Study, and (3) the Oakland Growth
Study. The first data set affords a test
of phenotypic convergence for values
and attitudes across twenty years beginning with engagement. The latter
two data sets permit us to examine phenotypic convergence in interpersonal
dispositions across middle adulthood.
In addition, the Berkeley and Oakland
studies enable us to employ a personcentered analysis as an alternative

Vol. 40, No. 1-2

to more traditional variable-centered
analyses in order to examine whether
couples increasingly resemble each
other across middle adulthood.

RESULTS

STUDY I. SPOUSE SIMILARITY FOR
VALUES AND ATTITUDES:
ENGAGEMENT AND 20 YEARS HENCE

Data for this analysis were obtained
from the Kelly Longitudinal Study.
The KLS is an especially appropriate
data set with which to examine the hypothesis of phenotypic convergence. It
is a relatively large longitudinal study
of marital dyads, spanning twenty
years beginning with engagement (see
Kelly, 1955).

Three hundred couples were initially contacted when they were engaged. The initial assessment program
thus took place before marriage. A
twenty-year follow-up was conducted
in 1953-54. One hundred and sixty-five
couples whose marriages had remained
intact provided complete data during
the second assessment program.

At both time periods, subjects completed the Study of Values. This instrument aims to measure six basic interests or motives in personality: the
theoretical, economic, aesthetic, social, political and religious. Although
the revised (1951) form increased the
reliability of the test (especially the social value), the original (1931) form of
this instrument was used on both measurement occasions in the KLS in order
to ensure the comparability of scales
across time (cf. Allport et al., 1970;
Vernon and Allport, 1931). Because
the social value on the original form
had unacceptable reliability we have

excluded this scale from our analysis.

Attitudes toward marriage were assessed in both 1935-38 and 1954-55
with the ““Views about the Ideal Marriage” questionnaire (Kelly, 1955).
Factor analyses with oblique rotation
were performed on the 33 5-point scale
items (1 = very essential; 5 = not desirable) separately by sex and assessment period. Four reliable factors
emerged from these analyses: Fidelity
(“After marriage the wife should be
100 per cent faithful to her husband
in regard to sex”; “After marriage
the husband should be 100 per cent
faithful to his wife in regard to sex’’);
Premarital Sex (“Wife should not
have had sexual intercourse with any
other man before marriage”; ‘“‘Husband should not have had sexual intercourse with any other woman before
marriage”); Companionship (‘‘Husband and wife should have similar
intellectual interests’; ““Husband and
wife should engage in the same outdoor sports”; “Husband and wife
should like the same types of amusements’’; “Husband and wife should be
about equally fond of social gatherings’); and Daily Activities (“Children
should be given religious instruction’’;
“Household affairs should be run in a
neat and orderly manner’; “Children
should be held to strict discipline’;
“Husband and wife should frequently
express their love for each other in
words”; ‘‘Husband and wife should
each respect the other’s religious, political, or ethical convictions and not
strive to change them”; “The wife
should be allowed a definite budget for
the household and for her personal expenditures’’).

this study was to assess the degree of

spouse similarity at two points during
the course of marriage. Tables 1 and 2
shows these results.

The magnitude of the spouse correlations for the five values on the
Allport-Vernon Scale is low-to-moderate and positive at both time periods
(Table 1). These correlations are similar to those reported by Schooley
(1936) 1n the only other study of marital assortment which included the
Study of Values. Moreover, the spouse
correlations are similar at both time
periods in the present study. The mean
spouse correlation across the five values is 0.36 on the first measurement occasion and 0.39 on the second measurement occasion.

The magnitude of the spouse correlations for the four attitudinal factors is
generally low and positive at both time
periods (Table 2). Moreover, the cor

relations are similar at both time periods. The mean spouse correlation
across the four factors is 0.21 on the
first measurement occasion and 0.23 on
the second measurement occasion.

The hypothesis that obtained
spouse correlations are due to convergence over the course of marriage receives no support in these data. Initial
assortment in personal values and attitudes toward marriage is comparable
in magnitude to the phenotypic similarity that is realized twenty years
later.

STUDY 2: SPOUSE SIMILARITY FOR
INTERPERSONAL DISPOSITIONS ACROSS
Mrpp_LE ADULTHOOD

Data for this study were obtained
from the archives of the Institute of
Human Development (IHD) at the
University of California, Berkeley (see
Eichorn, 1981). In the present analysis,
we focus on members of two longitudinal studies: (1) Berkeley Guidance
Study females (N = 22) and males
(N = 20), both groups with birth dates
in 1928—29, and their spouses; (2) Oakland Growth Study females (N = 17)
and males (N = 23), both groups with
birth dates in 1920-21, and their
spouses. In all, data are available on
82 couples. These couples have provided data on two occasions, in 1970
and in 1981. All the couples remained
married to each other over this time
period.

At both time periods, participants
completed the California Psychological
Inventory (CPI). The CPI was designed to assess normal personality
characteristics important in everyday
life (Megargee, 1972). The 1987 edition of the CPI contains 20 folk scales,

across middle adulthood. The mean
spouse correlations across the CPI
scales are 0.19 and 0.13 on the two
measurement occasions, respectively.
None of the correlations differ significantly from each other. These results
provide independent confirmation of
low positive spouse correlations in the
personality realm obtained in previous
research with different instruments. In
addition, these results confirm our previous finding of little change in spouse
correlations across time.

Table 3 also shows the spouse correlations for the 18 CPI scales reported
by Buss (1984b). A comparison of
the mean spouse correlation obtained
in his study of 93 couples (average
r = 0.22), whose average age was 28,

54 Caspi and Herbener

with the mean correlations from the
longer-standing marriages of the older
Berkeley and Oakland couples (average r= 0.20 and 0.14) reveals strikingly similar results.

A comparison of these independent
investigations may buttress the evidence against phenotypic convergence, but it may also reveal important
secular change in marital assortment
or the equally important absence
thereof. Indeed, noteworthy patterns
emerge when the CPI scales from the
two studies are grouped into more
global domains (cf. Gough, 1987). The
mean spouse correlations for scales
that index “internalization and endorsement of normative conventions”’
(Responsibility, Socialization, Selfcontrol, Good Impression, Communality, Tolerance, Well-being) and, to
a lesser extent, “thinking and behavior’ (Psychological-mindedness, Flexibility, Femininity/Masculinity) remain
relatively constant across time in our
study (average r = 0.24 and 0.26 for
each domain on the first occasion, and
0.25 and 0.11 for each domain on the
second occasion) and are similar to
those calculated in the cross-sectional
study by Buss (average r = 0.16 and
0.27 for each domain). Similarly, the
spouse correlations for scales that assess “cognitive and intellectual functioning” (Achievement via Conformance, Achievement via Independence,
Intellectual Efficiency) remain stable
across time in our study (average
r = 0.24 and 0.22) and are similar in
magnitude to the mean spouse correlation calculated in the Buss sample
(0.22). This latter finding appears to
support the claim that there has been
no secular decline in marital assortment for variables related to cognitive

 

Social Biology

abilities and educational attainment
(Heath et al., 1985; Johnson et al.,
1980; Mare, 1991; Rockwell, 1976).

However, important differences
between the two studies emerge on
CPI scales that assess “interpersonal
style and manner of dealing with
others” (Dominance, Capacity for
Status, Sociability, Social Presence,
Self-acceptance). Whereas the mean
spouse correlations for these five scales
are 0.12 and —0.01 in our study, the
mean spouse correlation in the Buss
sample is 0.30. The most striking differences between the two _ studies
emerge on Dominance, Capacity for
Status, and Social Presence. It is unlikely that these differences are merely
attributable to differences in educational attainment as the couples in both
studies are quite well-educated. It is
more likely that shifts in marital preferences have accompanied more recent and egalitarian times with a
commensurate trend toward positive
assortment on traits that measure
poise, ascendancy, and self-assurance.

In sum, the longitudinal data across
middle adulthood provide no evidence
that couples increasingly resemble
each other with time. Furthermore, the
spouse correlations among middleaged couples are similar to the correlations reported among newly-married
couples. In combination, these findings
support the view that spouse correlations are most likely not due to the convergence of phenotypes.

Traditional correlational indices of
spouse similarity, however, do not afford inferences about the specific similarity of any couple in the sample; they
only reflect the relative position or
rank order of couples in a sample. To
accurately reflect the similarity of each
Vol. 40, No. 1-2

couple, as well as to address the question of whether specific couples increasingly resemble each other with
time, we turn to an explicitly dyadic
mode of analysis.

STUDY 3: A “PERSON-CENTERED”’
ANALYSIS OF MARITAL ASSORTMENT
AND PHENOTYPIC CONVERGENCE

Most investigations of assortative
—marriage assess spouse similarity for
“each variable by calculating a correlation coefficient across all husbandowife pairs in the sample for each variSable studied. In contrast to this
o‘‘variable-centered” approach, in this
wstudy we take advantage of an alternacjtive method and employ a “person‘=centered” approach which permits separate and independent measurement
sof similarity for each couple studied.
= In the traditional variable-centered
Sapproach to the study of spouse simi‘Clarity, investigators have asked whether there is resemblance in the relative
srank-ordering of couples in terms of
‘Etheir tendency to display a similar re“sponse or attribute. In the personcentered approach to the study of marZital assortment we seek to identify each
‘Sperson’s attribute repertoire and then
"eto evaluate the similarity and dissimiolarity of the intraindividual organization of these attributes within couples.

This latter approach has two attractive
features. First, it enables us to conceptualize similarity as an attribute of each
dyad rather than a Statistic characterizing the sample. More importantly, it
enables us to examine whether members of a marital dyad are likely to increasingly resemble each other with
time.

Method and Procedure.—Data for

this study were again obtained from

Phenotypic Convergence SS

the archives of the Institute of Human
Development (IHD) at the University
of California, Berkeley. In this analysis, we focus on the original members
of the Berkeley Guidance Study (37 females and 38 males) and their spouses,
as well as on the original members of
the Oakland Growth Study (24 females
and 27 males) and their spouses. In all,
data are available on 75 and 51 couples
from the Berkeley and Oakland samples, respectively.

The Q-sort method, an ipsative assessment procedure that seeks to describe the comparative salience of attributes within each person, was used
to assess the participants’ personality
at two time periods: 1970 and 1981
(Block, 1961/1978). The California Qsort consists of 100 descriptive statements about personality, each typed on
a separate card. The judge’s task is to
sort the items into a forced, normal,
Q-category distribution that ranges
from (1) not at all characteristic to
(9) highly characteristic of the person
judged. The methods and standards
for Q-sorting at the Institute of Human Development have been described in detail elsewhere (Block,
1971; Eichorn, 1981; Haan et al.,
1986). Q-sorting has been done by experienced clinicians on data from intensive clinical interviews conducted
with the participants during the adult
assessments. The rule was established
that a judge should only have knowledge of a study member’s current status, thereby avoiding any bias introduced by knowledge of his or her past
functioning. At each time period, multiple judges independently described
each of the participants. For each participant, a composite Q-sort description was obtained by averaging the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

56 Caspi and Herbener

independent judges’ placements of
each of the 100 items. The average reliability of the case composites for the
males and females included in this report is 0.74.

To assess the personality similarity
of couples, we correlated the Q-sort
description of each husband with the
Q-sort description of his wife from the
same measurement occasion. These
correlations are descriptive indices of
similarity between two persons on one
occasion, with possible values ranging
from —1 (complete dissimilarity) to
+1 (complete similarity).

The advantage of these indices is
that they reference the similarity of
each couple within the sample. Unlike
assessments of similarity in traditional
variable-centered research, these indices do not require reference to other
sample members to derive their meaning. The disadvantage of these indices,
however, is that they do not yield information about the similarity of couples along any single attribute (Buss,
1985). Indeed, Cronbach and Gleser
(1953) noted long ago that we can only
discuss similarity as a general quality of
personality with respect to a set of
complex characteristics. Thus, if we
find people who are similar to each
other we can assume that they are generally similar only if the original measurement covered a large proportion
of the significant dimensions of personality. The 100 California Q-set items
arguably capture most of the fundamental dimensions of interest to personality psychologists (cf. McCrae et
al., 1986).

It should be noted, in addition, that
similarity scores based on standard
Pearson product-moment correlations
ignore both the elevation and scatter

Social Biology

components of profile similarity. However, this shortcoming is obviated in
the present analysis by the Q-sort
methodology where the number of descriptive statements placed in each category is fixed so the resultant distribution is normal in form.

Results. —Table 4 reports the distributions of the correlations between
Q-sort descriptions of couples in the
Berkeley and Oakland samples on two
measurement occasions. These correlations represent the similarity of each
couple’s personalities. As the Table
shows, the mean correlations of 0.32
and 0.40 are similar for the couples in
both samples on both measurement occasions.

Do these profile similarities differ
reliably from similarities that would
emerge under conditions of random
assortment? It should be noted that
the dyadic correlations cannot be interpreted in the same way as assortative mating coefficients obtained in
variable-centered analyses. In particular, their expected value is not necessarily zero and their sampling distribution is not known (Ozer and Gjerde,
1989). In order to establish a criterion
for significance, we created the elements required for a significance test
within our own samples. Specifically,
within each time period, each subject’s Q-sort profile was correlated
with the Q-sort profiles of all oppositesex subjects. This procedure yields a
matrix in which the diagonal values are
the actual profile similarities between
couples and the off-diagonal values
represent the similarity between subjects’ Q-sorts with unrelated, oppositesex subjects’ Q-sorts. The means of
random samples taken from the offdiagonal values can be compared with

; In each time period and for each

= sample, Berkeley and Oakland, we

_ generated 100 random samples for
—comparison with the profile similarities

‘3 1970 and 3 values that exceeded the

"= pointing to a modest degree of spouse

Do married couples increasingly resemble each other across time? To address this question we first corrected
the profile similarities by an estimate of
the dyadic correlation that would be
obtained in random assortments. This
procedure is critical, as the baseline for
the random correlation of any two
Q-sorts is not 0.00, but probably closer
to 0.2. In the present study, positive
base values are expected, given the

sample and raters. In addition, it is
possible that the base values may fluctuate as a function of the age of the
sample being rated (Ozer and Gjerde,
1989).

To estimate the base correlations in
the two samples, Berkeley and Oakland, we correlated each female subject’s Q-sort description with the
Q-sorts of all male subjects (cf. Ozer
and Gjerde, 1989). This operation was
performed four times, separately for
each measurement occasion in each
sample. For example, the 75 Berkeley
female Q-sorts were each correlated
with the 75 Berkeley male Q-sorts
from the 1970 assessment. The average
of the 5,625 (75 x 75) similarity profiles represents the base profile. The
base similarities obtained from this matrix, as well as from the T, Berkeley
matrix (75 Xx 75), the T,; Oakland matrix (51 x 51), and the T, Oakland
matrix (51 xX 51), were then used as
the divisors in correcting the actual
profile similarities in each sample.

To test for phenotypic convergence,
the corrected profile similarities were
used in a one-way repeated measures
analysis of variance with time as the
repeated factor. The results do not
support the hypothesis that couples

become more similar over time. This is
true in both Berkeley, F(1,74) = 1.96,
p=0.17, and Oakland, F(1,50) =
0.13, ns. In neither sample do couples increasingly resemble each other
across the course of their marriage during middle adulthood.

CONCLUSION

This study makes two contributions
to the study of marital assortment. It
offers a direct test of phenotypic
convergence and presents a personcentered alternative to traditional
variable-centered analyses of spouse
similarity.

Previous cross-sectional studies
have provided little support for the hypothesis that obtained spouse correlations result from increased similarity
over time. The present study substantiates these claims with longitudinal
data by demonstrating that spouse correlations are unlikely to change (a)
across a span of twenty years beginning
with engagement and (5) across a tenyear period during middle adulthood.
The results generally support previous
studies that show low but consistently
positive correlations between spouses
and suggest, in addition that these correlations are unlikely to change as a result of cohabitation and the convergence of phenotypes.

Importantly, these conclusions are
supported by both variable- and
person-centered approaches to the
study of spouse similarity. Variablecentered approaches to the study of
marital assortment reflect only one
facet of spouse similarity—the relative
position of husbands and wives in a
sample of couples. In contrast, the
person-centered approach affords in
Social Biology

ferences about the similarity of any
specific couple in the sample. Although
the two approaches are conceptually
distinct, they merit parallel examination. Thus, the person-centered approach employed in the present study
supplements the variable-centered approach and provides convergent evidence that obtained spouse correlations are most likely not the result of
the convergence of phenotypes over
time.

In conclusion, two cautionary notes
are issued. Although the present study
has failed to identify significant phenotypic convergence for values, attitudes
toward marriage, interpersonal dispositions, and the organization of personality attributes, it is possible that
convergence is simply restricted to
malleable role behaviors as well as to
relatively plastic variables (e.g., eating
habits, social activities) that are more
likely to be altered in the course of an
ongoing relationship (Price and Vandenberg, 1982). In addition, this study
has not addressed the processes that
contribute to spouse similarity. Although the estimates of spouse similarity remain relatively constant across
the course of marriage, it remains to be
determined whether the psychological
and environmental processes that produce initial assortment are identical to
those processes that produce enduring
similarities between couples (Caspi et
al., 1992).
