ABSTRACT: The “‘New World syndrome” is comprised of disorders that are hypothesized to have
resulted from an interaction of the Amerindian genotype with an environment that includes
marked changes in lifestyle and diet. The principal component of the syndrome is adult-onset
(noninsulin dependent) diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this paper is to describe the emergence
of diabetes in a Mexican-origin population. Using a unique file of multiple-cause mortality data,
we have computed standardized mortality ratios and relative standardized mortality ratios for
Mexican-origin individuals and for other white persons age 30 and over from the 1930’s through
the middle 1980’s. Results for the study population residing in Bexar County (San Antonio),
Texas, show that diabetes mortality for Mexican-origin individuals did indeed increase in a
pattern consistent with the New World syndrome hypothesis. This study is the first description
of the emergence of diabetes using a data set with consistently defined causes of death and
demographic characteristics.

become common with the exposure of
the genotypes to contemporary cultural and environment (including nutritional) conditions. The susceptibility
is expressed to a greater extent among
females than males because of females’
childbearing role (Neel, 1962, 1982). °

The purpose of this paper is to trace
the emergence of adult-onset diabetes
mellitus in a Mexican-origin population by examining trends in mortality
associated with diabetes from just before World War II through the early
1980’s. None of the earlier research
pertaining to adult-onset diabetes encompasses this entire period, and the
pattern of development of mortality
from diabetes in the Mexican-origin
population has never been documented. This study uses a unique collection of “‘multiple cause” death data
for Bexar County (San Antonio),
Texas, for estimating mortality associated with diabetes. These data offer
the longest uninterrupted series of
systematically coded death records
available for any Mexican-origin population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

There are major difficulties in investigations of long-term trends in health
status of the Mexican-origin population. No longitudinal health survey
data exist for studying the emergence
of a disease phenomenon like the New
World syndrome or its component conditions. The United States National
Health Interview Survey began including a separate identifier for persons of
Hispanic origin only since the mid1970’s. The first National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey aimed

37

specifically at Hispanics was not undertaken until the early 1980’s. Mortality data provide the best continuous
source of information about disease
conditions in a population and are useful for indicating long-term trends and
describing the natural history of a disease (Finch and Zimmet, 1988). However, even mortality data are rarely
available over extended periods for the
Mexican origin (or other Hispanic)
population in the United States.
Mortality data are not ideal for studies of disease etiology, prevalence, or
morbidity in a population. Death certificates usually only contain information about conditions judged to be
causes of death. Unless they are perceived to have contributed to death,
conditions such as obesity, diabetes, or
“silent” gallstones (even if diagnosed)
would rarely be included on certificates. A “cascading series’ of conditions ending in diabetes (or gallbladder
cancer), therefore, would ordinarily
not be described on death certificates,
unless a condition in the series were
present at the time of death and was
considered to have been associated
with death. Depending on the circumstances and causes, a certifying physician may or may not ascertain or perceive that diabetes played a role in a
death. It has been estimated to be reported on only 40 per cent of death certificates for persons who were otherwise known to be diabetic (U.S. Public
Health Service Centers for Disease
Control, 1991, p. 741), and diabetes is
selected as the underlying cause of
death in only about 25 per cent of the
certificates on which it is recorded
(Finch and Zimmet, 1988; U.S. Public
Health Service Centers for Disease
Control, 1989). Other problems with

using cause-of-death data, especially
for secular trend studies, are introduced by the major periodic revisions
in the classification of diseases which
can result in disconcerting aberrations
in death rates. Despite these problems,
which are by no means unique to diabetes, mortality data remain the best,
and in many cases the only, source for
historical studies of disease processes
in a population.

For present purposes, ‘multiple
cause” death data are most useful.
Such data include all conditions listed
by the certifying physician as contributing to or associated with a death. For
example, all decedents who died with
diabetes, as well as from the disease
can be included for study—whether
the disease was the underlying cause
or an associated cause contributing
to or merely present at death. Multiple cause data, therefore, give a more
complete picture than underlying
cause data of the role of a disease in the
morbidity and mortality of a population.

Although the data for the present
study pertain to a single community,
most of the problems with using death
data have been overcome. The analysis
is based on original death certificates
filed in Bexar County, during the years
1935-85, which represent approximately 284,000 deaths. All records
were coded according to a single causeof-death classification (ICD-9) (U.S.
Public Health Service, 1991) throughout the 51-year period. Every condition recorded on each death record
was coded in accordance with National
Center for Health Statistics nosological rules by NCHS-trained nosologists. About 12,400 certificates included a mention of diabetes. Because

Social Biology

all records were coded with a single
cause-of-death classification, the five
decades of data are not affected by the
disjunctures in codes that are introduced by periodic classification revisions. The data are, of course, influenced by changing medical knowledge,
fashions, and diagnostic techniques,
but no more so than other data covering the same period of study.

Demographic information on the
death records was also consistently
coded according to a single set of
codes. Persons of Mexican origin are
identified as white persons of Spanish
surname, a procedure which past research has shown to yield consistent
and reproducible results that in some
respects are preferable to those obtained from data on Mexican origin
decedents as identified by survivors
(Bradshaw and Frisbie, 1987; Rosenwaike and Bradshaw, 1988). Furthermore, the Spanish surname identifier is
the only one available prior to about
1980. For comparative purposes, the
non-Spanish surname white population
is also included, and separate analyses
are conducted for males and females.
Spanish surname population data were
obtained from the decennial censuses
of 1940 through 1980, from published
reports, public use samples, and special tabulations by the Bureau of the
Census. Because of small population
size, ethnic groups other than the
Spanish surname and non-Spanish surnames whites were excluded.

The subject area of this study—
Bexar County (San Antonio), Texas
—is a community in which large
Mexican-origin and Anglo-American
populations have interacted for many
generations. It was chosen for the
more general study of Mexican-origin

mortality because virtually all of the
resident Hispanic population is of
Mexican origin (93 per cent in 1980).
Local social and economic conditions
and characteristics which may affect
trends in mortality, and therefore data
for the Mexican origin population of
Bexar County may not necessarily produce measures that would be exactly
consistent with measures that might be
based on data for the Mexican-origin
population in the United States as a
whole (were such data available).
However, it is likely that such local
variation in living conditions would
have a greater effect on trends in infectious diseases than on those of a genetic origin. There is no reason to believe that changes in diet and other
factors associated with the emergence
of the New World syndrome diseases in
Bexar County would be significantly
different from other large metropolitan communities in the United States.

All decedents aged 30 and over who
died with diabetes mellitus (ICD-9,
code 250), whether or not it was the
underlying cause of death, are included
in this study. ICD~9 allows for several
categories of diabetes according to
complications (codes 250.0—250.9).
The disease may be further distinguished clinically between noninsulin(adult onset) or insulin-dependent
diabetes, but these codes are not routinely used in coding death certificates,
and they are not available in our data
set. Noninsulin-dependent diabetes,
the form associated with the New
World syndrome, accounts for about
90 per cent of clinical cases (Kuller et
al., 1986). However, it is very rare for
physicians to make such distinctions on
death certificates, regardless of age or
other characteristic of the decedent.

 

 

Diabetes Mellitus 39

As a means for partially excluding
insulin-dependent cases for present
purposes, only decedents aged 30 and
over were included. Undoubtedly,
some insulin dependent cases died at
ages beyond 30, but the numbers of
such persons would be small compared
to those who died with the non-insulin
dependent form of the disease.

METHODS OF ANALYSIS

Standardized mortality ratios
(SMR’s) and relative standardized
mortality ratios (RSMR’s, 1.e., the ratio of the cause-specific SMR’s to the
SMR for all causes) were computed for
diabetes for persons of Spanish surname and other white persons by sex.
Because of the relatively small annual
numbers of cause-specific deaths in the
early part of the study period, the number of observed deaths was averaged
over the ten years around the decennial census dates. The standard rates
are the average cause, age, and sexspecific rates for the United States
white population, 1979-81. A SMR of
1.00 implies that the number of observed deaths in the study population
equals the number that would be expected if the study population experienced the specific rates of the standard
population. The same standard rates
were used for computing SMR’s for
both underlying and multiple cause.
Multiple cause SMR’s, therefore, are
“inflated” relative to the underlying
cause SMR’s by the ratio of total mentions to underlying cause mentions.
The latter ratio is also presented because it suggests (but does not necessarily measure ) the relative “lethality”
of the disease in the different populations over time.

40 Bradshaw et al.

SMR’s alone are useful indicators of
mortality. However, their primary usefulness for present purposes is in illustrating trends over time, not in their
absolute values in comparison with the
United States white population of
1980. As Kupper et al. (1978) suggest,
the major interest may lie in the relative importance of a specific cause, particularly in comparing populations that
have much different overall death
rates. Thus, the ‘“‘correction’”’ for relative importance of a specific cause
demonstrated through the RSMR is of
considerable utility (Kupper et al.,
1978), especially for illustrating the
changes in disease patterns as overall
mortality declines. The RSMR for total mentions of diabetes can be interpreted as a measure of the relative
prevalence of the disease in the deceased population.!

Males and females were standardized separately with the respective
U.S. male and female age and underlying cause-specific rates. For this reason, the standardized measures presented for males and females are not
comparable except with respect to
trends, 1.e., comparisons are possible
within sex, but not between sex categories. For each sex, a SMR of 1.00 indicates that mortality due to a cause
was equal to the United States white
population mortality from that cause in
1980.

Separate measures were initially
computed for Mexican Americans and

1The RSMR is equal to the observed prevalence
divided by the expected prevalence of a cause. In
this instance, observed prevalence is measured by
the ratio of total mentions of diabetes as a cause
of death to the total number of deaths (i.e., deaths
due to all causes). Expected prevalence is the ratio
of expected mentions to expected deaths from all
causes.

Mexican immigrants (i.e., persons
born in the United States and Mexico,
respectively). However, there was essentially no difference between the two
throughout the study period in either
trend or magnitude, and therefore,
separate measures are not presented.
The subject of nativity is discussed further in the results section.

Because the focus of this paper is on
the emergence of diabetes as a cause of
death, primary emphasis is placed on
measures based on total mentions of
diabetes. Nevertheless, there is considerable interest in the role of diabetes as an underlying, as opposed to an
associated cause of death. Ratios of total mentions to underlying cause mentions of diabetes are also presented and
discussed.

RESULTS

Trends in standardized mortality ratios for persons of Spanish surname
(without regard to nativity) and other
white persons are illustrated for females and males in Table 1 and Figure
1. Measures are restricted to persons
age 30 and over. The table presents
SMR’s for all causes, SMR’s and
RSMR’s for diabetes (total mentions),
and ratios of total mentions of diabetes
to underlying cause mentions. The figures show some of the same data in
graphic form. The graphs provide a
better perspective for examining the
emergence of mortality from this component of the New World syndrome.

As described elsewhere, general
mortality levels in the Spanish surname
population converged with those for
other white persons from 1935-84
(Bradshaw and Frisbie, 1992; Carey et
al., 1992). Overall mortality trends, of

per cent higher than the SMR for other
white women at the time. Nearly all of
the improvement in all-cause mortality
among other white males and females
occurred from 1935-44 to 1945-54. In
general, there was little difference in
adult Spanish surname and other white
male mortality throughout the study

period, a finding repeatedly made in
the studies cited earlier which focused
on more recent periods. The similarity
in male mortality arises from offsetting
differences in death rates from different causes. Non-Spanish surname
white males have consistently been
found to have higher mortality from

heart disease and cancer, while Spanish surname males have had higher
mortality from diabetes, homicide,
motor vehicle accidents, and other
causes.

Unlike mortality from all causes,
standardized mortality ratios for total
mentions of diabetes increased in each
population—other white as well as
Mexican origin—reaching a peak in

= 1970, the central year of 1965-74 (Ta“ ble 1 and Figure 1). The graphs dem8 onstrate the widening gap in diabetes

® and other white populations. The difoo ferences in total mention SMR’s were

S By 1970, however, the total-mention
‘6 SMR’s for Spanish surname women

~~ the 1980 United States age-specific
3 death rates for diabetes as an underly"= ing cause. The corresponding 1970
= measures for other white females and
© males were 3.69 and 4.19, respectively.
Between 1970 and 1980, diabetes
SMR’s for all four groups declined to
levels below the 1970 peak—a trend
which is consistent with that in the
United States white population. The
widening gap between the two populations in diabetes SMR’s is attributable
to a more rapid increase in Spanish surname diabetes mortality. The annual
rate of change from 1940 to 1970 averaged 3.8 per cent for Spanish surname

 

Diabetes Mellitus 43

females and 4.4 per cent for males,
compared with 1.1 and 2.8 per cent for
other white women and men.
Nativity—i.e., whether a decedent
was born in the United States or
Mexico—is a variable that was expected to be important in studying an
emergent disease pattern associated
with population exposure to changing
environmental (in this case nutritional)
conditions. In fact, the diabetes SMR’s
of persons born in Mexico and the
United States are nearly identical, and,
therefore, as noted earlier, are not presented separately. These results were
not expected. Though we have no data
that tell us how long Mexico-born decedents had lived in the United States,
we had expected that U.S.-born persons would have had higher diabetes
mortality because they would presumably have had more time to become acculturated to United States nutritional
customs. A differential was expected,
especially for the early decades of the
study period, on the assumption that
nutritional patterns in Mexico and the
United States on average were probably less similar then than in later times.
The measures presented in this paper
are period-specific rather then cohortspecific. Further research may indicate
that different birth cohorts have followed somewhat different mortality
trajectories with respect to diabetes.
Available information suggests that diabetes mortality has also been increasing in Mexico, at least since the 1970s
(Zarate, 1991) and probably earlier.
Trends in relative standardized mortality ratios (RSMR’s) are depicted in
Figure 2. Only RSMR’s for total mentions of diabetes are shown because the
primary interest is in the changing
prevalence in diabetes in the deceased

population. The results are instructive.
Diabetes was of approximately equal
relative importance as a cause of death
in all four sex and ethnic groups until
1950, after which it rose rapidly for the
Spanish surname population, and to a
much smaller degree in the other white
population. Among Spanish surname
women the 1980 RSMR for diabetes

was over 5 times that of 1940. The
RSMR for other white women increased only 1.9 times during the same
period. Even though the mortality
level of diabetes, as measured by the
SMR, fell for all groups after 1970, the
relative importance of the disease in
the Spanish surname population continued to increase. The latter finding is
 

Vol. 42, No. 1-2

probably the result of reduced mortality from heart disease, which occurred
in all four populations (Stern et al.,
1987); that is, as death rates from heart
disease fell, the relative importance
of diabetes increased. However, it is
noteworthy that the relative importance of diabetes declined in the nonHispanic population.
A different view of the “preva2 lence’’ of diabetes in the deceased pop& ulation is presented as percentages of
8 decedents with a mention of the disE ease on their death certificate (Table
© 1). These figures are not standardized
«© for age, or expressed in relation to ex© pected deaths, but they are straightfor>. ward and informative with respect to

TM/UC ratios would be expected for
all groups assuming that all would have
benefitted from better medical management of diabetes (though not necessarily to the same degree). Independent of such a secular trend these
measures suggest the relative “‘lethality” of diabetes. In a population in
which diabetes is more commonly the
underlying cause of death the ratio is

nearer 1.0 compared with a population
in which the disease is more often listed

diabetes may be more often fatal in the
Spanish surname population. These results are consistent with the hypothesis
that attrition through mortality would
be higher among genetically susceptible persons who are exposed to an adverse environment that is conducive to
the development of the disease (Dowse
et al., 1991). It is noteworthy that the
ratio of total mentions to underlying
cause mentions is always higher for
non-Spanish surname men_ than
women, and this is usually the case in
the Spanish surname population. This
finding is to be expected based on earlier work on sex differences in diabetes
(Neel, 1982).

DISCUSSION

A consistent finding from research
on Mexican Americans is that the burden of diabetes as a cause of disability
and death is very high. In an early
study, Ellis (1962) listed diabetes mellitus as one of the leading causes of
death among the Spanish surname
population of San Antonio in 1950.
More recent studies of mortality and
morbidity have confirmed this finding
in several other populations, as well as
San Antonio (Flegal et al., 1991; Hazuda et al., 1988; Stern et al., 1991;
Diehl and Stern, 1989; Bradshaw et
al., 1986; Bradshaw and Frisbie, 1992;

al., 1992; Mitchell et al., 1990; Rosenwaike and Bradshaw, 1989). The importance of diabetes in Mexico has
also been documented. Interestingly, it
is in those areas of Mexico that are
linked most closely with the United
States that death rates from the disease
are highest (Zarate, 1991; Bradshaw,

1991). In both Mexico and the U.S.
Mexican-origin population the cost of
medical management and disability
from diabetes will undoubtedly remain
disproportionately high and is likely to
increase.

The results presented in this article

previously published work on diabetes mortality in the Mexican origin
population. They show that diabetes
emerged as a major cause of death in
the Mexican origin population relative
to the other white population after
1940, both in terms of risk of death as
measured by the SMR and in relative importance as measured by the
RSMR. The results also suggest that
the disease is more lethal in the
Mexican-origin population, as indicated by the ratio of total mentions
to underlying cause. The decline in
SMR’s after 1970 in all groups is
probably attributable to better medical
management of diabetes, though there
are indications from _ studies of
diabetes-susceptible populations elsewhere that declines may be the result
of mortal attrition of the more susceptible of the subgroups (Dowse et al.,
1991). Also, the susceptibility of the
Mexican origin population may be declining because changing genetic composition of the birth cohorts represented successive decades of data.
The results described here appear to
support the New World syndrome hypothesis insofar as they are consistent
with expectations based on that hypothesis. The hypothesis of the emergence of the New World syndrome
would lead us to expect that there
should be a more or less steady increase in mortality from the component diseases in the Mexican origin
population, particularly in females,
and that the mortality differential between them and other white persons
would tend to increase over time. Corollaries of the New World syndrome
hypothesis predict that the effect of the
“thrifty” genotype is stronger for females in general because of their child
 

Diabetes Mellitus 47

bearing role and that this effect is
stronger still for females with the longest exposure to contemporary environmental conditions. As expected, the
mortality data support these corollaries. The diabetes mortality of the Spanish surname females is higher than the
diabetes mortality of any other group
whether considered by sex or nativity.

The finding that diabetes mortality
(as measured by the SMR) was essentially similar among persons born in
Mexico and in the United States is inconsistent with the hypothesis of the
New World syndrome. Assuming that
Mexican Americans would have had
virtually lifelong exposure to mainstream U.S. dietary patterns, the New
World syndrome hypothesis suggests
that their mortality should be higher
than that of Mexican immigrants.
However, recent mortality patterns in
Mexico itself show that those regions
of the country where contacts with the
United States are likely to be closest
are precisely those areas with the
highest diabetes mortality (Bradshaw,
1991; Zarate, 1991). While the present
study does not establish a clear link between the nativity of Spanish surname
decedents and death from non-insulin
dependent diabetes, the association of
human migration with diabetes will
remain an interesting one for future
research as diabetes-susceptible populations move into different social environments or otherwise interact and acquire the nutritional habits of other
populations.

Finally, this article addresses only
one component of the New World syndrome. The syndrome construct has
been used here primarily as a guide to
research and to give meaning to the results for diabetes mortality. However,

we have not dealt with the syndrome as
a pattern of diseases, except in a cursory fashion. Further work remains to
be done in relation to the syndrome as
a pattern of diseases leading to death.
The syndrome is described as a series
of etiologically linked chronic diseases.
For example, gallbladder disease predisposes some persons to diabetes.
Since both conditions are chronic—
1.e., gallbladder disease would continue as diabetes developed—both diseases should be present at death. If
the syndrome exists, one would expect
to find at least some persons who died
with a mention of at least two of the
component conditions present at
death. In our database such a combination of conditions is very rare. Less
than 1 per cent of persons who died
with either disease had both diabetes

and gallbladder disease recorded at the
time of death. The implications of this
finding for the hypothesis of the New
World syndrome as a syndrome are unclear. The absence of the combination
of conditions may be an artifact of the
timing of cholecystectomies, a problem
in cause of death reporting, or the
dominance of diabetes among the New
World diseases.
