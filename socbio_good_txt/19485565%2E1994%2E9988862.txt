ABSTRACT: Accidents, injuries, and outcomes from adverse effects have been identified as the
second leading cause of death for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). However, no
studies have been done which analyze violent deaths (homicides, suicides, and other accidents)
for this population with a focus on time trends. For this study, overall and gender-specific
mortality rates due to violent deaths were computed for 1973-88. The results indicate that
overall and gender-specific mortality rates for violent deaths in AI/AN have been decreasing on
average per year: homicide, 4.3%; suicide, 2.7%; other accidents, 5.6%. Similarly, age-adjusted
rates have been declining, and at faster rates than those of the U.S. general population:
homicide, 4.5% vs. 1.4%; suicide, 2.5% vs. 0.6%; other accidents, 6.2% vs. 2.6%. However, the
male-female ratio for homicides and other accidents has remained unchanged, and the ratio for
suicide has been increasing. While the gap between age-adjusted rates have been narrowing, the
age-adjusted rates for AI/AN have remained consistently above those of the U.S. general
population.

Violence-related mortality, and vio- population, American Indians and
lence in general, has been identified as Alaska Natives (AI/AN). In general,
a major public health problem for the the AI/AN population is younger than

cumstances, intentionality, and conditions that cause injury, poisoning, and
other adverse effects. Given the time
period of the study, 1973-88, both the
eighth revision (ICD-8-CM) and
ninth revision (ICD—-9-—CM) were utilized. Concerning the issue of comparability between the two coding
schemes, prior work looked at this issue in depth and concluded that for the
three categories of mortality being
studied there were no major problems
associated with the transition from the
ICD-8-CM to the ICD-9-CM (Holinger and Klemen, 1982).

The denominator data for the estimated mortality rates were the annual
population estimates of AI/AN based
upon the 1970 and 1980 decennial U.S.
census. These yearly projections were
available from the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, Indian
Health Service (IHS), Office of Program Statistics. The population estimates reflect AI/AN living on and off
reservations and are projected through
linear regression techniques using birth
and death data provided to the IHS
from the National Center for Health
Statistics.

To analyze trends across the observed mortality rates, linear regression was done on both the estimated
annual mortality rates and the natural
logarithm of the annual mortality rates
relative to a time-trend index (Sokal
and Rohlf, 1969). This technique allows for evaluating both the average
absolute change and the average yearly
percentage change in mortality rates.
This methodology was applied to both
the overall rates and the genderspecific rates.

Lastly, estimated annual overall
mortality rates for homicide, suicide,

and other accidents for AI/AN were
compared to the rates for the U.S. general population. For purposes of comparison, rates were age-adjusted to the
U.S. population enumerated in 1940
and simplified by expressing the 1940
U.S. population on a standard million
basis (National Center for Health Statistics). In addition, estimated rates for
both groups were analyzed using linear
regression techniques to assess both
the average absolute change and the
average yearly percentage change in
age-adjusted mortality rates.

RESULTS
OVERALL AND GENDER-SPECIFIC RATES

Figures 1, 2, and 3 present a graphical overview of the observed behavior
of the three categories of mortality.
Table 1 summarizes the findings of
the trend analysis done on these respective time-series. Specifically, the
overall homicide mortality rates for the
AI/AN population have been declining
by 4.3 per cent per year on average,
with males experiencing an absolute
decline in rates on average by approximately 1.16 per 100,000 population
per year. For both males and females,
the percentage rate of decline on average per year has been comparable—4.2
per cent and 4.6 per cent respectively.
Similarly, for the period under study,
the overall suicide mortality rates have
been declining by 2.7 per cent per year
on average. For this category of mortality, females experienced a percentage rate of decline twice that of males,
4.6 per cent vs. 2.3 per cent. However,
in absolute terms, the decline in the
suicide mortality rate of males was
twice that of females—a decline of 0.63

Social Biology

verses 0.31 per 100,000 population per
year. Regarding the behavior of the
overall mortality rates due to the allother-accidents category, there has
been a decline on average by approximately 5.6 per cent per year. This decline was comparable across both genders. In the absolute change in rates on
average per year, the rate of decline for
males was almost three times as large
as that observed for females.

Lastly, while the overall and
gender-specific mortality rates for the
three categories have been declining
on average per year, a similar trend
was not observed in the behavior of the
male-to-female (M/F) ratio. Figure 4
presents a graphical representation of
the observed M/F ratios for the sixteen
years investigated. For the period under study, the M/F ratio for mortality
due to both homicide and the all-otheraccidents category has not seen significant changes either in the absolute
value or in the percentage rate of
change in the value. For homicide mortality, the M/F ratio has been about 3.2
with a standard deviation of 0.51; for
the all-other-accidents category, the
ratio has been approximately 2.8 with a
standard deviation of 0.17.

However, for suicide mortality,
there has been an observed increase in
the M/F ratio. Specifically, the ratio
has been increasing by approximately 2
per cent on average. In absolute terms,
this increase in the ratio converts to approximately 0.09 per year on average.

populations. A comparison of the
overall age-adjusted homicide mortality rates for AI/AN relative to those for
the All U.S. is shown in Table 2, Parts
A and B. The percentage rate of
change per year on average for AI/AN
was slightly less than four times greater
than that for the All U.S.; —4.5 per
cent vs. —1.4 per cent. In looking
at the absolute change in the ageadjusted rate, we see that this per cent
difference converts to a decline on average per year which is seven times
greater than that observed for the
All U.S. rates, —0.85 vs. —0.12 per
100,000 population per year.

For the overall age-adjusted mortality rate due to suicide, the All U.S. rate
declined less than 1 per cent per year
on average. For AI/AN, the ageadjusted rate declined on average by
over 2.5 per cent per year, approximately four times greater than the observed decline in the All U.S. rate;
—2.4 per cent vs. —0.6 per cent. Sim
ilarly, in absolute terms, the decline in
the age-adjusted rate for AI/AN was
over six times greater than the absolute decline in the All U.S. rate, —0.4
vs. —0.07 per 100,000 population per
year. For the overall age-adjusted rates
for the all-other-accidents category of
mortality, the All U.S. rate declined
on average per year by 2.6 per cent or
about 1.7 per 100,000 per year. For AI/
AN, the age-adjusted rate for this category of mortality declined approximately 6.2 per cent on average per
year, or about 6.9 per 100,000 per year.

An analysis of the difference, over
time, of the age-adjusted rates for both
the All U.S. and AI/AN populations
was done for the three categories of
mortality. For both the overall ageadjusted homicide and suicide rates,
the observed gap was estimated to
be shrinking by approximately 7 per
cent per year on average. Similarly,

DISCUSSION

In a study that utilizes national level
mortality data, it is important to recognize that certain limitations exist in
the data. Specifically, when dealing
with mortality data for suicides, homicides, and accidents in general, there
are always the issues of misclassification in the cause of death and of
changes in the coding scheme over
time. Misclassification refers to both
the intentional and unintentional miscoding of the cause of death on the
death certificate. Intentional underreporting of suicides or homicides may
be related to family influence, insurance benefits, religious reasons, and
social stigma, to name but a few. Unintentional underreporting may result
because there simply is not enough evidence available to support a final de
termination of the cause of death. It
has been suggested that reported mortality rates due to homicide and suicide
may be at least two or three times
lower than the actual numbers (Seiden,
1969; Toolan, 1975). Concerning the
other mortality grouping, all other accidents, overreporting is most likely to
occur. There would seem to be more
intentional overreporting of suicides
and homicides as accidents, again due
to the lack of available information to
support a final determination of death
or any of the other mentioned reasons.
In regard to changes in the coding
scheme, it has been documented elsewhere that there has been no apparent
change in the respective ICD-CM coding scheme over the sixteen-year period investigated (Holinger, 1987; Holinger and Klemen, 1982).

Given the limitations in the data, insights can still be gained from this analysis. While the literature has shown
that other minorities are experiencing
an epidemic increase in mortality due

108 Hisnanick

 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

to violent episodes (Griffen and Bell,
1989; Baker, 1990), AI/AN are experiencing the opposite. However, while
overall and gender-specific rates have
been dropping and the gap has been
narrowing between the age-adjusted
rates, the rates for AI/AN are still consistently above the benchmark of the
All U.S. population. It has been argued that the consistently higher rates
in AI/AN are a unique sociological
phenomenon centered around acculturation stress, potential weak family
ties, and inadequate social support systems (Shore, 1975). Similarly, it could
be argued that the higher rates are
largely due to the AI/AN overall economic situation. Given that AI/AN are
generally less educated and have
higher unemployment rates, and that
AI/AN households are more likely to
be below the poverty level than those
of the general population, AI/AN will

 

Social Biology

be more sensitive to the life stresses of
economic fluctuations (Brenner, 1979)
which may result in more episodes of
violent behavior leading to death.

However, no matter which paradigm is used in addressing this phenomenon, the observed declining rates
for AI/AN should raise questions
about what is being observed. Are
AI/AN becoming being more risk adverse in their behaviors or have specific programmatic changes occurred?
Such inquiries can only be addressed
through additional investigation and
study. While most studies of the health
status and conditions of AI/AN find increasing mortality and morbidity relative to the general population (U.S.
Dept. of Health and Human Services,
1992; Newman et al., 1990; Rhoades,
1990), the results from this study go
against this trend.
