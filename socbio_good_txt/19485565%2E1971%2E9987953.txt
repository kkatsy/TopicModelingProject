Information on Current Biomedical Research

Advance information on more than
31,000 current biomedical research projects is being made available for the first
time in dual-media format by the Science
Information Exchange of the Smithsonian
Institution and Walker-Carrollton Associates of New York and Washington.

As explained by SIE Director, Dr.
Monroe E, Freeman, “There are numerous
publications and services which report,
abstract, and index research results after
they have been described in the scientific
literature, but Biomedical Research in
Progress, 1970 is the first and only comprehensive, computer-based information
system which reports on biomedical research projects while they are still underway.” In effect, it hopes to fill the prepublication data gap in the biomedical
research literature.

Biomedical Research in Progress, 1970
is offered in dual-media format, with 31,
000 full text project summaries on 16mm
microfilm plus three computer generated
indexes in full-size book form. Each project appears in the Subject Index under an
average of eight separate hierarchical index terms, with each entry listing the
other descriptors used in indexing the
project. This is an important feature
because of the growing number of interdisciplinary research projects. Other alphabetical indexes include arrangements
by receiving contractors and by the names
of some 50,000 active investigators.

Purchasers of the 1970 edition also receive special prices on SIE’s new reference
service whereby telephone inquiries to
SIE specialists activate specific computer
searches of the complete data base.
