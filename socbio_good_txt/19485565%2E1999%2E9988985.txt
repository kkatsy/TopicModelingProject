ABSTRACT: Using data from the 1993 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, this study explores the relationship between ethnicity and sexual behavior: having sex before age 17 and premarital sexual experience. All ethnic groups show substantial sexual experience before age 17
and premarital sexual engagement. Logistic regression analyses reveal that in general ethnicity
influences the behaviors studied, especially for ever-married women. The data suggest that
groups that practice matrilineal and patrilineal systems show differences in the likelihood of
having sex before age 17. Contrary to expectation, there is an inverse relationship between education and sexual experience before age 17. The findings highlight the importance of group
specific programs in Africa.

The greatest health challenge facing
African countries is how to contain the
spread of the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) that causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS). According
to a United Nations country-by-country
analysis of the disease in 1997, thirty million people world-wide were infected
with HIV, of which twenty-one million
were in Africa. There is increasing awareness that most HIV infections in Africa
are transmitted through heterosexual intercourse (WHO, 1994; Goncalves, 1994;
Obbo, 1993; Padian et al., 1991).

In Africa an increasing number of
younger unmarried adolescents are having premarital sex and multiple sexual
partners (Buga et al., 1996; Lagarde et
al., 1996; Renne, 1993; Pillai and Yates,
1993; Anarfi, 1991; Orubuloye et al.,
1991). The consequences of these sexual
activities are high incidence of pregnancies, births, and abortions among young
unmarried women (Ajayi et al., 1991;
Castle et al., 1990; United Nations,
1989). Also accompanying these shifts in

17

adolescent sexual activities and fertility
has been sharp increase in the incidence
of HIV infection in Africa (WHO, 1994).
Longitudinal studies suggest that HIV
prevalence among women of childbearing
age increased at a near-exponential rate
during the 1980’s, with a doubling time
of one to three years in some urban areas
(Gregson et al., 1994). Given the high
prevalence of HIV infection through heterosexual intercourse, it is important to
understand the factors shaping sexual onset.

Ethnographic and other literature show
that sexual behavior customs vary from
prohibition to permissiveness across cultural groups in Africa (Murdock, 1967,
1964; Westbrook, 1963). Epidemiological
studies have identified sexual promiscuity
as the most important cultural factor contributing to HIV transmission in Africa
(Caldwell et al., 1989; Johnson and Laga,
1988; Clumeck, 1988; Mann et al., 1988;
Hrdy, 1987). In addition, certain cultural
practices may elevate the likelihood of
HIV infection among young women in

 
18 Addai

Africa (Meekers and Calves, 1997; Network, 1997; Weiss et al., 1996; EsuWilliam, 1994). For instance, the practice
of marrying daughters at earlier ages, often to older polygamous men, prevalent
among various ethnic groups, particularly
in west Africa, increases the likelihood of
infection (Network, 1997).

Studies have also documented that
each cultural group in Africa had unique
cnorms and practices that regulated sexual
‘activities with relevant sanctions when

ores were breached (Feyisetan and PebBoy, 1989; Richards, 1982; Sarpong, 1977;
AKabwegyere, 1977; Weekes-Vagliani, 1977;
Fortes, 1954; Kenyatta, 1938; Leaky,
21931). Despite the repeated reference in
cOAIDS literature to cultural practices and
miorms such as non-monogamous rela‘cfions (Caldwell et al., 1989; Anonymous,
1988; O’Reilly, 1986), there are few studYes, if any, which have systematically assessed whether cultural background per
Sse is an important predictor of sexual be‘havior in Africa. The extent to which speQific cultural background predicts sexual
‘behavior is almost an unknown. This

A
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

Most studies on sexual activity in
Africa have used one of three approaches
to explain female sexual behavior. The
first, the “subcultural hypothesis,” holds
that female sexual behavior is shaped by
subgroup expectations, customs, and
norms (Mutambirwa, 1990; Schlegel and
Barry, 1986; Broude, 1981; Goethals,
1978; Goody, 1976, 1973, 1971, 1969;

Social Biology

Eckhardt, 1971; Murdock, 1967, 1964;
Coleman, 1966). This explanation maintains that group variations in sexual behavior are primarily due to cultural norms
and practices specific to particular groups.
Based on anthropological studies three
main theses can be subsumed under the
subcultural hypothesis.

The first thesis associates female sexual behavior to her social role in a particular group or society (Schlegel and Barry,
1986). According to Schlegel and Barry,
there is an association between the female social role and sexual permissiveness. The basic proposition of this explanation is that societies with high female
contribution to subsistence are likely to
allow a higher level of sexual permissiveness. Therefore, high level of sexual permissiveness will characterize groups with
high female contribution to subsistence.

Assuming that in Africa women’s contribution to subsistence is higher in rural
areas than in urban settings, then the expectation is that women born and raised
in rural areas should demonstrate a higher
level of sexual permissiveness, such as
early sexual intercourse and premarital
sexual experience, than their urban counterparts. Studies from Africa do not support this proposition (Meekers, 1994;
Orubuloye et al., 1991; Anarfi, 1991). For
instance, in Ekiti, Nigeria, Orubuloye et
al. (1991) reported a higher level of premarital and extramarital sexual activity
among urban residents than their rural
counterparts.

Another variant of the subcultural hypothesis is “the diverging devolution thesis” (Goody, 1969). At the center of this
explanation is the relationship between
property ownership, the lineage, and sexuality. The basic premise of this thesis is
that if property belongs to lineage rather

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

Vol. 46, No. 1-2

than to individuals or nuclear families,
then there will be less need to control
women’s sexuality. According to the logic
of this explanation, groups in which property belongs to lineage should display a
high incidence of premarital sexual activities and out-of-wedlock birth (Lesthaeghe,
1986). In the context of the diverging devolution perspective, Goody (1969) has
suggested that female sexual behavior in
Africa is shaped strongly by poor farming
techniques that do not generate surplus
and wealth and by the lack of diverging
inheritance.

The third variant of the subcultural hypothesis is the “patrilineal bias thesis”
(Goethals, 1978; Eckhardt, 1971; Coleman, 1966; Murdock, 1964). This explanation associates type of kinship system
with sexual behavior among women. The
basic supposition is that where males are
in a position of power and authority, that
is, where the kinship system is patriarchal,
sanctions against female nonmarital sexual behavior tend to be more severe than
where females have authority, as in a matriarchal situation (Goethals, 1978). Murdock’s (1964) study of 180 societies
around the world found that patrilineal societies are more restrictive about female
sexual freedom than matrilineal societies.
Based on this patrilineal bias thesis, the
incidence of early sexual initiation and
premarital sexual experience should be
higher among matrilineal groups.

The second hypothesis is termed the
“rational adaptation hypothesis” (Philipson and Posner, 1995; Barker and Rich,
1992; Schoepf, 1988). This hypothesis
links the level of female sexual activity to
gender inequality in the distribution of resources in a particular society. It argues
that keeping women poor gives prosperous men ready access to multiple sexual

Ethnicity and Sexual Behavior

19

partners because it keeps the “price” of
women’s sexual services low.

Proponents of the rational adaptation
hypothesis explain the current sexual behavior of women, especially the unmarried in Africa, in terms of economic benefits (Barker and Rich, 1992; Schoepf,
1988). For example, in their study of adolescent sexuality in Nigeria, Barker and
Rich (1992) have reported that poverty
was partly the cause of sexual intercourse, particularly among students.

“Social disorganization” is the third
hypothesis. This perspective is grounded
in the social control theory (Hirschi,
1969). It relates female sexual activity to
change in traditional social control. This
hypothesis attributes the current level of
female sexual activity to a breakdown of
the social control that older persons had
over younger ones (Enel and Pison, 1990;
Bauni, 1990; Ocholla-Ayayo et al., 1990;
Cherlin and Riley, 1986). A study by
Ocholla-Ayayo et al. (1990, p. 67) in
Kenya reported that 60 per cent of the respondents did not believe that traditional
norms restricting premarital and extramarital sexual relations were applicable
in contemporary society. In other African
societies, studies have shown that premarital virginity is no longer considered
important, particularly in urban settings
(see Orubuloye et al., 1991; Anarfi, 1991;
Ochalla-Ayayo et al., 1990).

The social disorganization hypothesis
suggests that education, urbanization, and
Western media work to erode the basis of
the traditional social control of female
sexual activities in sub-Saharan Africa.
These forces of modernization, according
to the social disorganization theory, have
armed youth with knowledge with which
to challenge the wisdom of the traditional
control of sexual behavior.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study uses data from the Ghana
Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS)
conducted in 1993. The GDHS is a nationally representative, stratified, selfweighting, probability sample of women
aged 15-49. Households were identified
using a three-stage cluster sampling pro
cedure based on census enumeration arSeas (ecological zones as well as rural and
urban localities). One hundred and fifty
=census enumeration areas were selected
Sfor the survey, with probability proporAtional to the number of 1984 census
households. Ninety-eight per cent of all
Celigible women (women within the
costated age range of the study who spent
the previous night in the selected houseshold) were successfully interviewed, rezsulting in a final sample of 4,562 women
.2(Ghana Statistical Services, 1993).

= The data on age at first intercourse in a
developing country like Ghana deserve
“ssome comment (Weiss et al., 1996). Given
Ythe sensitive nature of sexual behavior, it
‘may be reasonable for people to be skeptiStal about the quality of data gathered on
sexual behavior. It is noteworthy that
¥Blane and Rutenberg (1990, 1991) have
reported that response rates on questions
Fon first sexual intercourse were very good
Ain the GDHS questionnaire.

Blanc and Rutenberg (1990) documented that if age at first intercourse was
greater than age at first marriage by more
than one year, then the age at first intercourse was decreased by one year to
make the two dates consistent. Such an
adjustment is a common procedure to
correct the order of events (Kahn et al.,
1988). In order to reduce the extent of
mismatch between age at first intercourse
and age at first marriage, a code indicat

ing that the respondent initiated sexual
intercourse at the time of her union was
added to the question on age at first intercourse in the 1993 GDHS based on the
Phase II model questionnaire.

ANALYSIS

Dependent variables.—Two measures
of sexual behavior, having sex before
age 17 (as an indicator of early sexual
onset) and premarital sexual experience
(proxy for multiple sexual partners), are
used in this study. Based on measures of
sexual behavior, the dependent variables
used in this paper are: (1) sexual intercourse before age 17 (coded: sexual intercourse at exact age 16 and younger =
1; sexual intercourse at any age = 0);
(2) premarital sexual experience (coded:
sexual experience before marriage = 1;
sexual intercourse at time of marriage =
0). The analysis is carried out for nevermarried and ever-married women separately.

These measures of sexual behavior
have been selected for two reasons. First,
the physiology of the developing cervix is
likely to increase the vulnerability of
young women (age 16 and younger) to
sexually transmitted diseases, including
HIV (NAS, 1996). Second, studies in
Africa have found that most women have
their premarital sexual experience with
men other than their husbands (Djamba,
1995; Anarfi, 1991; Orubuloye et al.,
1991). Although what proportion of the
increase in susceptibility to STD’s observed among teens is behavioral, social,
or biological in nature is unclear, what is
certain in the literature is the association
between increased infection of STD’s, including HIV, with early sexual onset and
multiple partners (McCauley and Salter,
1995; Strobino, 1987).

Independent variables.——This — study
cannot directly assess the impact of subgroup norms and practices on sexual behavior because such information is not
available in the data set. Ethnic heritage
is used as a proxy for cultural norms and
practices. Ethnic heritage refers to the
broad categories of ethnic groupings respondents identified during the survey.
Seven cultural groups are used in this
study: Twi, Fante, Other Akans, GaAdangbe, Ewe, Guans/Others, and MoleDagbani.

The Twi (Ashanti and Akwapim),
Fante, and Other Akans are Akan people
with a matrilineal kinship system. The
Ga-Adangbe, the Ewe-speaking people,
the Guans/Others, and the Mole-Dagbani
are patrilineal. The likelihood of engaging in sexual behavior for Fante, Other
Akans, Ga-Adangbe, Ewe, Guans/Others,
and Mole-Dagbani women is contrasted
with that of their Twi counterparts.

Control variables.—Contro] variables
have been selected because of their theoretical importance and availability in our
data set (Djamba, 1997; Meekers, 1994;
Brewster et al., 1993). Some variables
such as parents’ education and income
are not included in the analysis because
such predictors are not available. In the
present study, the following variables are
used as controls: (a) respondent’s education categorized into (1) no education,
(2) primary/Jss, (3) secondary/higher; (b)
childhood place of residence, (1) urban,
(2) rural; (c) age cohort, (1) 15-24, (2)
25-34, (3) 35-49; and (d) age at marriage
(continuous variable, for ever-married
women).

Statistical Procedure-——The dichotomous nature of the dependent variables
suggests that logistic multiple regression
is the most appropriate technique for

Ethnicity and Sexual Behavior 21

analysis (DeMaris, 1995). Regression coefficients, level of significance based on
the Wald statistic, and associated odds ratios for all the variables are presented for
each contrast of the independent and control variables. The logistic regression
equation takes the form:

In (q,/1 —q,) = bg + 5;X;

where q; is the estimated probability of a
particular event occurring to an individual with a given set of characteristics, X,;
by is a constant that defines the probability; and bs are the estimated coefficients.

The ratio (q,/]—g,) is the ratio of
women with the given set of characteristics engaging in sexual behavior versus
not engaging. The estimate of b, for a
particular covariate X, is interpreted as
the difference in the predicted log odds
between those who fall within that category of characteristics and those who fall
within the reference or omitted category
for that characteristic. If each estimated
b, is exponentiated, (exp[D,]), the result
can be interpreted as giving the relative
odds of engaging in sexual behavior for
those individuals with characteristics X,
relative to those individuals in the reference group.

The Mole-Dagbani women are the least

no education is about 63 per cent, with
6.6 per cent having secondary/ higher education.

Over 50 per cent of Twi, Fante, GaAdangbe, and Ewe women were raised in
rural areas. The majority of Guans/Others
and Mole-Dagbani women were raised in
rural settings. The average age at marriage among the ethnic groups does not
vary much from 18.18 among Guans/
Others to 18.88 among Ga-Adangbe
women.

SEXUAL BEHAVIOR

Percentage distributions of measures

Table 2. As Table 2 indicates, 58 per cent
of never-married sexually experienced
women had their first sexual experience

systems. This finding lends some support
to the patrilineal bias thesis.

experience for never-married women. GaAdangbe women reported a higher incidence of sexual experience (69.9 per
cent) than all the other ethnic groups. The
lowest level of sexual experience is observed among Mole-Dagbani women.
Eight of every ten ever-married Twi

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS

Sexual intercourse before age 17.—
Table 3 shows results of the logistic regression analysis of sexual initiation before age
17 for never-married and ever-married
women separately. In Model I only GaAdangbe background emerges as a significant predictor of sexual experience before
age 17. The probability that a Ga-Adangbe
woman had sex before age 17 is 50 per
cent lower than her counterpart in the

24 Addai

reference group. When relevant correlates
of sexual behavior are controlled, the importance of ethnic background on the
likelihood of sexual initiation before age
17 among never-married women does not
change (Model ID).

Among ever-married women, Fante,
Other Akans, and Mole-Dagbani ethnic
backgrounds significantly influence sexual
experience before age 17 (Model II). The
likelihood of having sex before age 17 is
positively associated with Fante and Other
Akans backgrounds (odds = 1.216 and
1.199, respectively). Women belonging to
the Mole-Dagbani group show a lower
likelihood of sexual initiation before age
17 (odds = 0.726). Controlling for selected predictors of sexua] behavior, we
find the impact of ethnic background on
the odds of sexual experience before age
17 continues to persist for the same three
groups as in the reduced model. Also, for
the first time, Guans/Others background
emerges as a significant predictor of having sex before age 17 in Model IV.

Premarital sexual intercourse.-—The
relationship between ethnic background
and premarital sexual experience is investigated by modeling four separate logistic
regression equations (Table 4). Model V
shows that Ga-Adangbe background increases the odds (odds = 1.726) of sexual
experience for never-married women. In
contrast, Mole-Dagbani background induces lower odds of sexual experience for
never-married women. Model VI shows
that even after controls, the relationship
between ethnic background and sexual
experience does not change.

Model VII shows the relationship between ethnicity and premarital sexual experience among five of the six groups for
ever-married women. Other Akans, GaAdangbe, and Ewe women exhibit a higher

 

Social Biology

propensity for premarital sexual experience. On the other hand, Guans/Others and
Mole-Dagbani women show a lower likelihood of sexual experience before marriage.
Model VIII indicates that after other predictors of sexual behavior are controlled,
the impact of Other Akan background on
premarital sexual experience vanishes.
However, the influence of Ga-Adangbe,
Ewe, Guans/Others, and Mole-Dagbani
backgrounds on the likelihood of sexual
experience before marriage persists.

DISCUSSION

The GDHS 1993 data suggest that sexual intercourse often starts at an early age
among women in Ghana. Almost 60 per
cent and 53 per cent of never-married and
ever-married women respectively started
having sex before age 17. The level of .
premarital sexual experience is not different. About 58 per cent of never-married
women were sexually experienced at the
time of the survey. Seventy-two per cent
of ever-married women acknowledged
having sex before marriage. The high incidence of sexual behavior reported here
might suggest that cultural norms and
controls do not strongly influence socialization, particularly adolescent sexual behavior in Ghana.

However, findings from this exploratory
study suggest the possible effect of cultural
values and norms in predicting sexual behavior. The likelihood that specific subgroup norms, customs, and practices would
influence a woman’s sexual behavior is related to her marital status. Cultural background is more likely to influence sexual
behavior among the ever-married women
than their never-married counterparts.

Ga-Adangbe is the only ethnic background that influences sexual experience

before marriage. What is interesting here
is that although all the groups are patrilineal, the direction of the impact of ethnicity varies. These findings contradict the
basic proposition of the patrilineal bias
thesis.

Why does ethnic background affect a
woman’s decision-making about sexual
behavior as reported here? Although difficult to test directly because of the limitation of our data set, we can speculate that
some of the findings may be related to the
kinship system practiced by the various

ethnic groups. What appears to distinguish the sexual behavior of matrilineal
from patrilineal groups is the level of tolerance of adolescent sexual activities and
births (Fortes, 1978; Gessain, 1971). The
matrilineal Akans from central and coastal
Ghana are relatively liberal about sexual
behavior, especially out-of-wedlock births.

For instance, among Twi-speaking
Akans, particularly the Ashantis who are
the largest Akan group in Ghana, the maternal lineage is the “permanent and fundamental institution which permeates
 

Vol. 46, No. 1-2

every aspect of life” (Bleek, 1987, p. 139),

including sexual behavior. The most im
portant determinant of a child’s identity,

rights, and status is the maternal lineage.

This situation has created a cultural norm

where children are welcome to the

mother’s lineage with less concern about
mother’s marital status at the time of birth.

Therefore, young girls may enter into sex, ual relations with less concern about the
= consequences of such behavior (Caldwell
‘et al., 1989; Sarpong, 1977, 1974; Fortes,
1954).

In contrast, the patrilineal Ewe, GaA Adangbe, Mole-Dagbani, and Guans/
ce Others are more conservative ethnic
oo groups. They observe more sexual taboos
co than matrilineal groups (Huber, 1993;
3 Nukunya, 1992; Dery, 1987). Because
"= heritage is traced through the father, mar.oital status of a woman at birth is critical.
5 The patrilineal groups impose more rea strictions on premarital sexual relations.
© Girls are given less latitude when it

© and marriage is very important in such
‘= groups (Huber, 1993; Nukunya, 1992).

— The other correlates of sexual behavior
© deserve some attention. For never-married
8 women, having a secondary/higher educaS tion results in a lower propensity to en= gage in sex before age 17. This finding
& does not support the popular notion that
education promotes teenage sexual experience. The general explanation of this
observation is that the perceived access to
future options in life may deter early onset of sexual activity and unintended parenthood. This finding has been corroborated by earlier studies based on data
from other African countries (see Gage

and Meekers, 1994; Nichols et al., 1987).

There is an inverse relationship between

cembe

 

 

Ethnicity and Sexual Behavior 27

fore age 17 for ever-married women. This
finding implies that the high incidence of
sexual experience before age 17 for evermarried is potentially related to early age
at marriage.

The propensity to engage in premarital
sex 1S positively associated with education
and age at marriage. These findings are
not as contradictory as they may appear.
Similar observations have been reported
in Africa (Twa-twa, 1997; Kiragu, 1991;
Feyisetan and Pebley, 1989). For instance,
Feyisetan and Pebley (1989) have documented higher rates of premarital sexual
experience among women with secondary
or post-secondary education than women
with lower levels of education. In the context of declining age at first menarche in
Ghana (Adadevoh, et al., 1989), the risk
of premarital sexual activity is likely to
increase as young girls stay in school
longer and delay marriage.

As expected, the older age-cohort
women display lower odds of sexual initiation before age 17 as well as premarital
sexual experience. Also, women raised in
rural areas show lower odds of premarital
sexual experience. These findings may be
explained in the context of social control
over sexual behavior when the 35-49
years olds were growing up as well as the
conservative culture and traditionalism
dominant in rural areas. These findings
support an earlier study using data from
Ghana (Addai, forthcoming).

In another context, the higher odds of
premarital sex among women who have
attained a secondary/higher education
may be related to deteriorating economic
conditions facing most African countries
which tend to place young women at risk
of sexual encounters. Reports abound, particularly in countries of sub-Saharan Africa
undergoing structural adjustment programs,

of young women conceding to pressures
from older men and trading sexual favors
for school fees, food, transportation, and
clothing in order to continue their education, to support their families, or simply to
survive (Hawkins et al., 1992; Barker and
Rich, 1992; Standing, 1989).

While suggesting an association between ethnic background and sexual behavior, the findings of this study leave a
number of important issues unresolved.
The extent to which relationship between
ethnic background and sexual behavior observed in this study support delineated hypotheses is not clear. Recently, studies have
found gender differences in sexual behavior in Africa (Anarfi, 1991; Orubuloye et
al., 1991). Whether the impact of cultural
norms, values, and practices vary between
women and men can not be answered by
this study because of lack of data on men.
Another issue concerns the omission of potentially key predictors of sexual behavior.
Limitations imposed by our data call for
caution in generalizing the findings.

CONCLUSIONS

Nothwithstanding the above issues,
the findings of this study are important to
African population programs, particularly
in the context of increased efforts by international donors to target their family
planning and reproductive health programs at subnational areas and groups.
The main policy implication of the study
is the need to develop culturally relevant
reproductive health and family planning
programs for various groups.

The differential impact of ethnic background on sexual activities studied in this
paper suggests that for reproductive
health and family planning programs to
achieve a respectable measure of success

Social Biology

in the fight against HIV/AIDS and teenage
pregnancies, programs have to take into
account the cultural milieu. The programs
must be African and particularly directed
to the different ethnic groups. International, nongovernmental organizations and
national policy makers should not regard
all Africans as alike, but rather should determine the unique situational and cultural
environments of the many different ethnic
groups.

The need for group-specific programs
is reinforced by the fact that cultural beliefs in many African societies promote
female sexual submissiveness, polygamy,
male dominance, and sexual violence. All
these factors reduce the possibility of a —
young girl refusing sexual relations
(NRC, 1997). Understanding of groupspecific norms, values, and beliefs which
tend to put young women at risk can help
address the HIV and STD’s problems.

The economic and sociocultural environments of African societies are such
that the only programs likely to make a
difference in efforts to contain HIV infection in Africa are ones based on the ethnic groups’ norms and practices. For example, the ritualized forms of conduct
which acknowledge a young person’s
postpubertal status may be a useful tool
for minimizing the likelihood of early
sexual onset, teenage pregnancies, and
hence the risk of HIV infection. An empirical study of initiation rites in the various cultural groups in Africa might provide a key to designing programs and
strategies acceptable to different ethnic
groups. For instance, girls’ initiation ceremonies in Ghana such as Bragro among
Ashantis and Dipo among Krobos (Huber, 1993; Sarpong, 1977, 1974), can provide a medium for diffusing knowledge
about risks in various traditional sexual
 

Vol. 46, No. 1-2

practices as well as the need for family
planning. Such strategies have the potential to be successful because they preserve unique aspects of a group’s culture
and at the same time introduce changes in
behavior and attitudes.

This study also suggests that another
way to minimize early sexual onset, the
risk of HIV infection, and pregnancies in

_,Africa is to promote education for women
sto at least the secondary level. This sugges“tion has been echoed in the literature for
ages. What is required now is for health
YXand population experts to be less concerned
Aabout mechanisms through which education effects population and health change.
Efforts should be geared toward undercostanding correlates of women’s educational
attainment in Africa. Educational policies

lates into higher educational opportunities for women may be misleading. International nongovernmental organizations
and governments trying to address health
and population problems in Africa need
to come to terms with how women can be
encouraged to attain at least a secondary
education. The most baffling thing is the
on-going decline in school enrollment,
especially for girls in Africa. The supposed free-education policy in most
African countries may not be enough to
bring women into the educational system
and to keep them there without taking
into account cultural factors preventing
women from going to school.

In an era when African countries are
challenged to find the right mix of policies and programs to bring about
progress, particularly in reproductive
health, the significance of group-specific
strategies in dealing with health problems
such as HIV infection prevention as well
as women’s educational issues cannot be
neglected.
