+. ABSTRACT: Births while on public assistance has been one of the central topics in the welfare de© bate in Maryland because the welfare grant increases with the number of children, and there is
E debate about whether or not to continue the increased income provision. Based on the Quality
© Control (QC) data for the period from July 1991 to June 1992, this study examined differentials

in the incidence of births conceived and borne while the mothers were on welfare. The results in© dicate that about one-quarter of recipient children were born on welfare and that higher inci& dences of these births occur among mothers with less than high-school education, never-married,
cn young, Baltimore residents, and with fewer children at entry on welfare. The presence of parents
* of welfare mothers or of any adults in the household is found to reduce the incidence of births.
— Disallowance of the increased welfare grant for additional children may increase the number of
5 families in poverty and the number of children in foster care unless efforts are made to reduce
‘< unintentional births and school drop-outs and to fill the gap between mothers’ schooling and the

.= needs of the job market.

Controversy still continues on the is> sue of fertility of welfare mothers in gen
_
=

c eral, and the occurrence of births while
‘ on welfare in particular. Policymakers
and the public in general tend to assume
>that women on welfare have large numz bers of children, and many contend that
because benefits increase with the in= crease in the number of children, mothers
= on welfare have a financial incentive to
A bear more children.

Contrary to this assumption, research
findings in Wisconsin demonstrate reverse
results, that welfare mothers have lower
fertility rates than nonwelfare mothers
(Rank, 1994, p. 74; 1989). A similar study
by the Washington State Institute for Public Policy (1992) demonstrated that family
income fell further below the federal
poverty line as the number of children in a
household increased, and that there was

no statistical difference in the birthrates of
women receiving public assistance and
women not receiving public assistance.
Schultz (1995), with break-down by race
and age, observed a significant negative
relation of AFDC benefits with fertility
for white mothers of ages 12-24 and an
insignificant relation with black mothers.
The AFDC families with unemployed parents for both races, except at ages 15-—
24, showed a negative but insignificant relation with fertility, which was even
stronger among blacks.

As noted by Phillips and Fronstin
(1993), for mothers who are already on
Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the promise of receiving more benefits does not enter into any decisions they
make about having another child. Acs
(1993) argues that the cost of raising a
child is substantial, and the amount of

92 Ahmed and Hill

money a mother would receive would
hardly defray that cost. High benefits may
instead influence a mother’s decision to
participate in AFDC, but not her decision
to have a child.

On the other hand, Lundberg and Plotnick (1995) provided a mixed picture of
economic incentives of public policies in
relation to becoming a teenage unwed
mother. White teenagers were found to be
positively responsive to the changes in
welfare, abortion, and family planning
policies; black teenagers were found indifferent to such changes. Although they
did not advocate a strong causal relation,
they did argue that economic incentives
influence adolescent premarital childbearing in addition to social, cultural, and attitudinal factors. Thus, a great deal of controversy exists among planners, policy
makers, and researchers on this issue.
However, the issue here is not whether
welfare mothers have higher fertility than
others, rather it is the issue that births increase public expenditures.

In Maryland, as in many other states,
the issue of additional births while on public assistance continues to be one of the
central topics in the welfare reform debate.
In the existing system, the amount of the
AFDC grant increases with additional
children, which in turn increases the state
expenditures for welfare. If the present
system, for instance, remains unchanged, a
mother with two children receives $162
more a month than a mother with one
child, which includes AFDC, food stamps,
and energy/heating (Code of Maryland
Department of Human Resources, Title
07, Chapter 02; Staveley, 1994). The grant
starts at the birth of a child and continues
until the child starts earning or reaches age
18. This large public expenditure certainly
explains the gravity of the problem.

Social Biology

To reduce such expenditures, the Govermor’s commission on welfare and the
Maryland State administration reviewed
two proposals among others—one was
not to increase the AFDC grant for any
additional children while on public assistance, and the other was to relax the abortion laws for mothers on welfare and to
promote knowledge and practice of family planning (Governor’s Commission on
Welfare Policy, 1994). The underlying intention of the former was to provide a
disincentive to having births while on
welfare by not increasing the monthly
grant. The latter one was to facilitate the
former strategy of reducing unwanted
births by providing adequate means and
services for abortions. Under the existing
system, a woman qualifies for terminating a pregnancy with Medicaid funds
only when she is the victim of rape or incest or that pregnancy poses a serious
threat to her mental or physical health
(Frece, 1995). Consequently, abortions
for unwanted births other than those reasons are not permissible by law, which
limits access to the relevant facilities, in
turn resulting in higher numbers of unwed mothers and unwanted births among
low-income women.

Obviously, additional births of children of AFDC mothers increase public
expenditures. We need to see the problem
from different angles. Why did these
mothers decide to have additional babies
while they were on welfare? Was the decision voluntary or involuntary? If the decision was voluntary, was it for completing a desired family size when there is no
immediate prospect of getting off welfare? Was it with the intention of fostering as well as sustaining strong interpersonal relationship between the partners
through having additional births? Or, was
Vol. 44, No. 1-2

it for obtaining a larger monthly grant? If
the decision was involuntary, did the recipient mothers have adequate knowledge
about the use and availability of contraception and adequate means to purchase
contraception? Without clear understanding of these issues, it is difficult to pin
down the potential points where policy
interventions are likely to curb the likelihood of births to women on welfare.
To have a clear understanding of such
decision-making processes, we need a
specially designed survey with a focus on
® these issues. The available sources of
A data preclude such in-depth analysis.

2 Within the limitations of the given data
& source, this study attempts to evaluate the
co prevailing incidence of births on welfare
< and its socioeconomic differentials. It also
g attempts to evaluate the timing of first
9 birth after entry on welfare and the major
‘9 rtsk factors for having births after entry on
2 welfare. Specifically, we intend to test the
© following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1.—The higher the level of
education, the lower the likelihood of hav
= ing births while on welfare. Education is
> negatively related to age at first childbearing (Weeks, 1993) and to family size.
oa.
8 Since better-educated mothers are -more
& likely to get off welfare, they tend to re= frain from having additional children
& while on welfare and look forward to a
life off welfare and self-dependency. In
addition, educated mothers have better
knowledge about available methods of
contraception, sources of their supply, and
their appropriate and effective uses. This
knowledge reduces their chances of unintentional births.

Hypothesis 2.—The larger the number
of children at entry on welfare, the lower
the likelihood of having births on welfare.
Mothers with large number of children at

mber 2015

Births While on Welfare

entry on welfare are less likely to have additional children while on welfare. Having
additional children is likely to prolong
their stay on welfare and incur more discomfort which is usually not compensated
by the amount of enhanced grant for additional children (Rank, 1994). Besides,
many of these mothers may already have
completed their desired family size.
Hypotheses 3.—The lower the age at
entry on welfare, the higher the likelihood of having births on welfare. Mothers entering welfare at younger ages are
likely to be less endowed with human
capital (such as years of schooling, training, etc.), which is likely to be a strong
hindrance to getting jobs which in turn
prolongs their stay on welfare. Perceiving
less chance of immediately getting off
welfare because of poverty, uncertain
economic conditions, and low prospects
for achtevement, young mothers often become discouraged about making transitions to adulthood through educational
and career achievement (Hogan and Kitagawa, 1985). As a result, some mothers
might consider completing their desired
family size, if they have one, despite their
chances of becoming more impoverished.
Hypothesis 4.—Household composition
is likely to have some influence on the likelihood of having births. Some have argued
that having another adult in the household
facilitates childbearing by providing childcare and financial support, while others
suggest that the presence of parents reduces childbearing by increasing adult
supervision. Hogan and Kitagawa (1985)
found that the presence of parents significantly reduced the likelihood of daughters becoming pregnant because parents
supervised their dating. We hypothesize
that the presence of parents in the household is likely to reduce the chances of a

woman having additional births on welfare. In addition to providing necessary
services, as in a time of need, parents do
provide motivational support to their
daughters toward becoming self-reliant;
and to a certain extent their presence reduces sexual promiscuity and the chances
of unintentional births, which in turn enhances the welfare mothers’ participation
in education and job-training programs.
The presence of any unrelated adults, if
they are live-together partners, has two
possible influences on the chances of
additional births. On the one hand, the
live-together partners may increase the
chances of having births if they desire to
foster a strong bond in their relationship.
On the other hand, live-together partners
are evidently more rational in their reproductive behavior than partners not living
together and are more likely to have
strong motivation to be self-reliant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA

The data used for this study are the
Quality Control (QC) data collected by
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the period from
June 1991 to July 1992. The primary use
of this data is for HHS to check errors in
the AFDC grant assessment. Very few
analyses of this data have been done for
scientific purposes. Despite some basic
limitations of the QC data, it is a useful
source for examining characteristics of
AFDC recipients that have important significance for policy formulation.

~. METHODS

(a) Current Duration on Welfare.—
The current duration on welfare has been

Social Biology

estimated from the date of most recent
opening and the date of review (sample
month and year). While the date of recent
opening has day, month, and year, the
date of review has only the month and the
year. Consequently, the estimates of current duration on welfare suffer from an
underestimation of an amount ranging
from 1 to 29 days. However, this has little
impact on our analysis since the duration
has been used in years.

(6) Births on Welfare.—In the existing
system of Quality Control data, there is no
direct information on births that occurred
while recipients were on the welfare rolls.
However, using an indirect method, this
variable has been created. To create it, we
used date of most recent opening, date of
sample review, and ages of children. First,
we estimated the current duration on
welfare, and then we matched this information with the ages of children. If the
duration is greater than the age of any
own-children, we considered that child
was born on welfare. In this method of estimation, the births that occurred while on
welfare but were conceived before receiving welfare (before the date of most recent
opening) were not considered as births on
welfare. In other words, births that occurred during first nine months since the
most recent opening were not considered
as births on welfare. In doing so, we encountered some problems because of using zero as the code for the ages of children under one year. Thus, children who
were older than nine months but less than
one year were considered as births not on
welfare because there is no way we could
identify their status.

(c) Parity Progression Ratio.—The
parity progression ratio (PPR) is the proportion of women who proceed from one
parity to the next higher parity, that is, the

proportion of women who have ever borne
N+1 children among those who have ever
borne N children.

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS:
LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL

The logistic regression mode] is considered here to assess the influence of various socioeconomic characteristics while
simultaneously controlling for other variables on the likelihood of births occurring
while on welfare. The dependent variable
is whether a recipient gave birth to a child
while she was receiving public assistance.
The variable is coded “1” for “yes” and
“0” for “no.” Since our primary interest
was to analyze whether any births occurred while the woman was receiving
public assistance, we did not consider the
issues Of multiple births on welfare. The
independent variables are current age of
AFDC mothers, race, region, education,
marital status, and number of children at
entry.

The logistic regression model used in
the present study’ may be expressed as:

p=P(Y=1)
In(_?_)=a+BX

I-P
where Y is the dependent variable, which
is odds for having additional children
with response categories “1” for yes and
“0” for “no,” a is an intercept, and B ts a
coefficient vector corresponding to the
vector of socioeconomic and demographic factors, X.

RESULTS
BIVARIATE ANALYSIS

The results indicate that about onefourth of the families (23.3 per cent) had

Births While on Welfare

 

95

at least one birth while on welfare, and
about 6.5 per cent had more than one
birth (not shown in tables). Blacks differ
substantially from whites. While 26.2 per
cent of blacks had births on welfare,
whites had a lower percentage at 15.2.
The percentage of one birth among blacks
(19.2 per cent) was much higher than
whites (11.9 per cent), as were the corresponding percentages for two or more
births at 7.8 and 3.4 per cent, respectively.

To avoid the complexity of the relationship between household heads and
dependent-child recipients, we focused
our analysis on AFDC mothers who were
also household heads which reduced our
working sample size from 1,383 AFDC
families to 1,178 AFDC mothers. The
subsequent analyses are based on these
mothers. Table 1 presents socioeconomic
differentials in incidence of births. These
birth rates are estimated as the ratio of
AFDC mothers who had at least one birth
while on welfare to the total AFDC mothers. It appears that the incidence of births
does not change until the mothers’ ages
reach about 30, and after that it starts declining, which is true for both racial
groups. Regarding the regional difference,
the residents of Baltimore show almost
two-times higher birth incidence than the
other regions. Mothers with high school
or more education have about 25 per cent
lower incidence of births than mothers
with less than high school education. This
difference appears to be larger among
blacks than whites. Never-married mothers tend to have more than two-times
higher incidence than the ever-married
mothers. Although marital status does not
make much difference between blacks
and whites in terms of relative risks, the
incidence for having additional births is
much higher among black never-married

among whites than blacks. Notable differences are also observed with respect to
the status of receiving prior assistance.
The birth rate appears to be much higher
(about 24 per cent) for those with no experience of receiving public assistance.
This difference is because part of the reproductive period of mothers having prior

considered as births on welfare. There
may be other contributing factors for such
differences.

We have also examined the differentials with respect to family composition.
Two basic indicators were used—presence of parents of AFDC mothers and
presence of any unrelated adults in the
households. Presence of parents as well
as presence of any unrelated adults in the
household appear to contribute to lower
birth rates. These differences are even
stronger among whites than blacks.

The parity progression ratios of Table
2 give more insights on the dynamics of
the growth of family size by the socioeconomic characteristics of mothers.
Comparing the parity progression ratios
(PPR’s) of mothers having births on welfare with those who have not, the ratio at
each parity, in general, is higher for
mothers having births on welfare. This
w finding indicates that these mothers have
S higher chances of having larger numbers
+ Of children than others. Blacks tend to
‘2 have higher likelihood of having larger
family sizes than whites. Among other
factors included in the table, mothers in
Baltimore, with less than high-school education, with prior experience of receiving public assistance, and of ever-married
marital status have higher likelihoods of
having larger family sizes.

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS:
LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS

Table 3 presents the results of logistic
regression analysis. From the estimated
coefficients for all, it appears that all the
variables have significant roles on the
likelihood of births on welfare. Mothers
", of younger ages, not married, black, with
4 less than high-school education and with
s fewer children at entry are more likely to
5 have births on welfare. The effect of age
& on the likelihood of births is quadratic.
That is, the odds of having births increase
until age 30,! which is about one year
less for blacks than whites. After that
point, the odds of having births significantly decrease as women get older.

The peak of the parabola (30.1 years) for the quadratic-relationship of age and the likelihood of birth is
derived from the following equation:

dP/dAge = .601 —.02 (Age) = 0

Births While on Welfare 97

Never-married mothers have stronger
likelihood of having births than their evermarried counterparts. However, the difference in incidence of births between the
marital statuses seems to vary between the
panels. In the regions outside Baltimore,
never-married mothers are two-and-a-half
times more likely than ever-married
women to have births while this difference is insignificant in Baltimore. This
finding may have resulted from the disproportionate number of ever-married
women living in Baltimore. As observed,
the percentage of ever-married women in
Baltimore was only about 18 per cent
compared to about 35 per cent in other regions in the sample under study. These
percentages were 20 and 41 for blacks
and whites, respectively. Since the majority of AFDC mothers in Baltimore were
black, the lower incidence of marriage
among blacks is perhaps a primary factor
for such discrepancies. High unemployment, Jow educational attainment, and
high poverty in Baltimore may have contributed to the low incidence of marriage
and high incidences of births out-ofwedlock and those on welfare. Unmarried
white mothers are 83 per cent more likely
than ever-married white mothers to have
births while the corresponding difference
for blacks is about 56 per cent.

With varying strength of relationships
across the panels, education shows an inverse relationship with the likelihood of
having births. Mothers with a high-school
education have 40 per cent less chance of
having births. The control of other factors
has widened the difference due to education
than what was found earlier in bivariate settings. Having a high-school or more education makes a substantial reduction in the
likelihood of births for blacks compared to
whites.

“The number of cases is less than 20.

As it appears, the number of children
prior to welfare is by far the strongest determinant of the likelihood of births. For
each additional child born prior to wel
fare, the likelihood of having births on

welfare decreases by 3.1 times, which are
6.3 and 2.6 times for whites and blacks
respectively. That is, mothers entering on
welfare with more children are less likely
to have births on welfare, and whites
have a much stronger negative relation
than blacks.

Presence of parents and any unrelated
adults show similar relationships as observed earlier. Even after controlling for
other factors, we find their presence
seems to have significant effects on the
likelihood of births. The presence of parents reduces the likelihood by about 40

negative effect appears to be significantly
stronger among whites. Again, beyond
the dichotomy of presence or absence, the
parental characteristics, which is not in
the purview of this study, are likely to
make profound impact on the mothers’
likelihood of having births. A similar type
of effect is also observed with the presence of any unrelated adults, but the effect is somewhat lower than that of the
parents’ presence. It may be noted that
prior assistance was included in the initial
model, but the result was found statistically insignificant although there was an
indication of higher likelihood of births
for mothers who did not have prior assistance. It is also relevant to mention that

was about 28 months, which was found
to be low for mothers with younger ages,
unmarried, fewer children, and blacks
(not shown in the table).

CONCLUSIONS

This analysis shows that about onefourth of the AFDC families (assistance
units) had at least one birth while they
were on welfare. Blacks had a substan
tially higher incidence of births, about 68
per cent, than whites. The incidence of
births was almost two-times higher
among the mothers in Baltimore than
those in other regions of Maryland, which
is partly attributable to the disproportionately higher percentage of blacks living
in Baltimore. High unemployment, low
educational attainment, and high poverty
in Baltimore may also have contributed
to such a large difference. Mothers with

less than high-school education, nevermarried, and at younger ages had higher
incidences of births. Education appears to
have a stronger negative effect on births
for blacks. Family composition and status
of receiving prior assistance also had a
strong influence on the likelihood of
births. Households with parents of AFDC
mothers and with unrelated adults were
found to have lower incidences of births
as did families who received prior assistance. Of the selected characteristics, the
mother’s age and the number of children
at entry were stronger determinants of the
likelihood of having births on welfare.
However, the likelihood had significant
relations with race, marital status, education, and place of residence. The analysis
also showed that the average interval between entry on welfare and the occurrence
of first birth on welfare was about 28
months. Whites appear to have a longer

interval than blacks. This interval is
strongly influenced by the age at entry on
welfare, marital status of mother, and number of children at entry.
