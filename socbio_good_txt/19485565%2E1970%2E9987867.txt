Valparaiso, Chile

As a preliminary to a broad genetic study
of the population of Valparaiso (PintoCisternas and Figueroa, 1967), we thought
it necessary to examine the available data
on consanguinity. On the basis of these data,
we have tried to establish zones with different inbreeding coefficients and have compared the values found with those observed
in other regions of Chile and elsewhere. We
have also attempted to determine how certain variables—especially social, economic,
and cultural ones—influence these coefficients and the frequency of consanguineous
marriages in space and time.

The province is located in the central
zone of Chile (long. 33°, lat. 71°5’) and
has a surface of 5,118 sq. km. and a population of 737,355 inhabitants (Geografia
Econémica de Chile, 1950, 1966). After
Santiago, it is Chile’s most densely populated province. Valparaiso’s topography is
very irregular due to the coastal mountains
which run from North to South in the eastern part of the province and whose altitude
exceeds 2,000 meters at some points. From
the main mountain range, smaller hills run
transversely toward the coast, leaving
valleys in between with steppe characteristics. These valleys have an average altitude
of around 200 meters above sea level, with

the exception of the Aconcagua River valley,
which is lower and very fertile. These territorial characteristics have made it difficult
to build good roads between different points
in the province, thus permitting the persistence of geographic isolates.

The high population of the province reflects the presence of the cities of Valparaiso
and Vifia del Mar, and the existence of other
nuclei with populations between 25,000 and
50,000 inhabitants (Quilpué, Quillota, Limache, Villa Alemana, Calera). These centers
also account for the predominance of the
urban population over the rural one.

Economic activity is mainly commercial.
Valparaiso is the principal port of the country and the most important of the South
Pacific. There are, however, significant
industrial and mining developments and
intensive agriculture in the valley of the
Aconcagua River.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The data were obtained directly from
the files of the diocese of Valparaiso, which
registers the dispensations for consanguineous marriages given by the priests of the
55 parishes of the diocese. Catholic canon
Jaw requires such dispensations in order to
permit marriages between related persons.

The period 1917-1966 was chosen for
two reasons: First, a shorter lapse of time
seemed unlikely to permit thorough analysis, particularly of the changes in the frequency of consanguineous marriages which
may have occurred with time. Second, centralization of the records of the Archbishopric of Valparaiso did not occur until 1916;
prior to that date the pertinent records
were maintained at the different parishes of
the diocese, and access to them is difficult.

Lists were made of all of the dispensations
granted in every parish each year; these
lists recorded the names of the contracted
parties, their degree of consanguinity, and
the reason for the dispensation. The following code was used to classify the degree of
consanguinity by marriage types:

Type 12—uncle-niece (aunt-nephew),

Type 22—first cousins,

Type 23—first cousins once removed,

Type 33—second cousins,
Type M—other degrees of consanguinity,

In order to classify these marriages further, the geographic area and the boundaries
of every parish were determined, and the
fusions and divisions which have occurred
were noted; these latter data were provided
by the Secretary of the Archbishopric of
Valparaiso.

To determine the total number of marriages, of which the consanguineous ones are
merely a subset, civil data based on the
present administrative division of the province was needed. We have therefore used
official census sources to obtain the following data on each subdivision (commune)
for each year: (1) area in sq. km., (2) total
number of inhabitants, and (3) total number of civil marriages. We have also recorded
the nuptial rate within the province for each
year (Direccién de Estadistica y Censo,
19642, 19645, 1964c, 1965).

Because of the small number of consanguineous marriages within each year and
parish, the different parishes have been
grouped into areas which coincide, as nearly

Social Biology

as possible, with communal area groupings
made according to certain specific socioeco- .
nomic characteristics of the province (Matterlart, 1965).

In all, four zones were formed, which
due to their essential characteristics were
named: Urban, Dry-agricultural, Miningagricultural, and Urban-agricultural.

The zones and the communes which comprise them are listed below and shown in

Zone IV
Urban-agricultural

Zone I, the Urban Zone, includes the
principal population centers, the cities of
Valparaiso and Vifia del Mar. Both are
situated on a steeply ascending coast. The
altitude of this zone ranges from sea level to
600 meters. Outside the urban radius the
topographically irregular territory is not
agricultural.

Zone II, the Dry-agricultural Zone, although divided into two subregions, is
essentially rural, and its population has
existed until recently as a series of geographic isolates. Its altitude reaches 1,000
meters in the northern part and 600 meters
in the southern. Cultivation is mainly dry
farming, which is done at the lower altitudes
which are close to the coast and in Casablanca.

Zone III, the Mining-agricultural Zone,
consists mainly of a single valley, less than
200 meters in altitude. It is irrigated by the
Aconcagua River, which permits intensive
agricultural cultivation. The nonagricultural territory is about 40% of the zone,

and it is formed by mountain ranges 600
meters high where there is some mining
activity.

Zone IV, the Urban-agricultural Zone,
has had a rapid population increase because
of its proximity to Valparaiso and Vifia del
Mar, The altitude of this zone ranges between 100 and 1,500 meters, and the topography is very irregular. The major urban
centers are situated at lower altitudes (100
to 200 meters) and around them extensive
agriculture and dry farming occurs. However, no more than 20% of the soil is under
cultivation.

Once the zones were determined, the
total data for fifty years were divided into

  

Consanguinity in Chile 169

intervals of five and ten years. For each
group we determined: (1) total area of the
zone; (2) mean population; (3) mean population density; (4) total number of civil marriages; (5) number and type of consanguineous marriages; (6) percentage of consanguineous marriages among the total number
of civil marriages; (7) mean value of endogamy.

To study the bases for dispensations, the
data were grouped by decades, considering
only two zones (I and IT), two types of marriages (22 and 33), and seven groups of
motives (moral, geographic, economic, psychological, social, chronological, and judicial

motives), according to canon law (PintoCisternas and Moroni, 1967).

As other authors have already indicated
(Moroni, 1962), the use of ecclesiastic data
may lead us to conclusions of limited validity because of the various errors they may
incorporate. While the present observations
may not be error-free, it seems unlikely that
such errors as may exist are sufficiently
numerous or important to invalidate the
results obtained.

It may be supposed that there are some
errors in the total number of consanguineous
marriages, as the data were taken from
transcriptions which could contain errors
due to omission or to the incorrect recording
of parish, for example.

The fact that the ecclesiastic and the
civil divisions do not coincide exactly introduces an element of approximation as do
the interpolations made with the civil data
in those instances where the total data
could not be used. It must also be noted that
the civil division of today derives from a less
complex division, thus making necessary
calculations according to area, density, and
population.

As there are 97 consanguineous marriages
that were not registered in parishes but in
the jurisdiction of the Castrense vicarage,
we decided to distribute them proportionally in space and in time. This fact may have
an influence on our findings.

Last, the endogamy coefficients were
obtained by establishing a relation between
the consanguineous Catholic marriages and
the total civil marriages; these values might
be somewhat lower than the real ones, because of the possibility of non-Catholic
consanguineous marriages. However, since
a high percentage of the Chilean population
professes the Roman Catholic faith (96%
according to the census of 1929, and 91.4%
according to the census of 1960), the number of non-Catholic marriages will be so low
that they will not significantly influence the
total results.

RESULTS

The analysis of the data proceeded in
the following manner: (1) analysis of the
province considered as a whole and divided
into zones; (2) comparison between these
data and those of other regions of Chile and
of other countries; (3) analysis of the different types of consanguineous marriages; (4)
analysis of the bases for dispensations.

Table 1 shows the total population, the
number of civil marriages, the nuptial rate,
and the number and percentage of consanguineous marriages for each year in the
whole province, Figure 2, where the data are
shown in the form of percentages based upon
moving three-year intervals (Croxton and
Cowden, 1965) clearly illustrates the extent
of the variation in consanguineous marriages
and nuptial rate. Analysis reveals that while
the nuptial rate remains relatively constant
(excepting the period following the first
world war) the number of marriages increases with time, whereas the frequency of
consanguineous marriages fluctuates, tending to decrease continuously after 1959.
Nevertheless, there are three periods (191720; 1931-34; 1944-48) which show a remarkable rise in consanguineous marriages and
a relative decrease in nuptiality. The causes
for this situation, also encountered by other
authors (Sutter and Goux, 1962; Tweisselmann, Moreau, and Francois, 1962; Moroni,
1964), may be essentially socioeconomic and
reflect a period of war. Although Chile was
not involved in either World War I or II,
the turmoil elsewhere had an indirect influence, which in concert with the economic
crisis of 1930 brought about a fall in nuptiality, caused by the economic restrictions,
and a rise in consanguineous marriages
which often serve to maintain or even increase a family’s economic holdings.

To estimate the degree of heterogeneity
of the observed fluctuations in the consanguineous marriages, a chi-square analysis
was made, grouping the data by decades

(Table 2); the resulting value of 89.69 is
highly significant. Chi-square analysis of
each individual decade confirms the heterogeneity in time. The chi-square values are:
1917-26, 47.27; 1927-36, 16.92; 1937-46,
16.08; 1947-56, 8.48; and 1957-66, 27.91.

Table 3 gives the general data, separated
by zones and by decades. From their analysis, high values for the rural zone and lower
ones for the remaining regions could be
deduced. In any case, the high values of

distribution of the types of marriages during
these periods, should be noted.

On comparing the relation of population
density to the mean value of endogamy
based on the data given on the Table 3, it
can be observed that only one decade (192736) shows in all zones the inverse relationship of these two variables as was already
indicated by other authors (Freire-Maia,
1957; Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1960; PintoCisternas and Moroni, 1967). Another
decade (1937-46) shows almost the same
relationship, while the other two decades

way, referring to the zones, only Zone II
clearly shows this inverse relation, while
in the others the relation is not constant.
These facts could be due to different demographic, social, and economic characteristics

these characteristics throughout time.

estimated number of consanguineous marriages with the total number of marriages.
This comparison is given in Table 4, Their
analysis indicated that Zones I and III and
Zones II and IV show similar tendencies.

A comparative study discloses in general

shown that the chi-square value of Zone I
is very similar to that of the whole province;
this may be explained by the fact that this

In general, it should be expected that in the
zones of greater density (I and III) the observed number of consanguineous marriages
should be lower than the estimated number
and that the inverse should occur in the
zones of less density (II and IV). Table 4
shows that this does occur in all the zones,
with only three exceptions: in Zone I during
the first decade, in Zone III during the
second decade, and in Zone IV in the fifth

decade. The possible causes may be the
high percentage of consanguineous marriages in the first decennial, socioeconomic
causes produced by the 1930 crisis, and the
notable rise of density with a slow breakdown of the geographic isolates.

We thought it necessary to compare the
general data of this paper with those given

Thus, zones or regions which might have
some similarities with the one here studied
were chosen, as it did not seem useful to do
so with regions or isolates which show
remarkable differences to those of our paper.
Table 5 has been constructed in such a way
that years and periods correspond exactly
to ours. This was feasible because the data

done at three different levels: with data of
the same zone, with those obtained in other
zones of the country, or with data of other
countries. It must be said that any comparison of this kind can only reveal very general
differences or similarities; for different
reasons—different methodologies, data, conditions, and demographic characteristics,
etc.—the results are not always homologous.

1951-55. The only other known data for
Zone I are those resulting from a survey of
Pinto-Cisternas and Figueroa (1967), who
found for marriages contracted between
1940 and 1950, 0.84% of consanguineous
marriages with a mean endogamy value of
0.00047. These values are not very different
from those mentioned in the present paper.

the whole province, for the reasons already
mentioned. At the same time, Zone II is
very heterogeneous in the diverse cousin
marriages, showing a slightly higher frequency of marriages between second cousins
and first cousins once removed than in the
other zones. This fact, which also coincides
with the data given by other authors (Valls,
1960, 1966), who even indicate that in
purely rural zones, the frequency of con

consanguineous marriages for the whole
province and for the most contrasting zones
(Urban and Dry-agricultural), when the
data are grouped into decades. From the
three graphs of this figure, one observes that
the highest frequency corresponds to first
cousins, then to second cousins, and that the
lowest one corresponds to uncle (or aunt) and
niece (or nephew) marriages which agrees
with the data found in the literature (Tweisselmann, Mourant, and Francois, 1962;
Barrai and Moroni, 1965). The figure clearly shows the similarity between Zone I and

highest of all. The differences between Zones
I and II were to be expected, considering
the demographic disparity and the different
socioeconomic evolution of each one during
the last fifty years.

The last analysis was directed toward the
reasons for dispensations, in order to determine which factors agree with the distribution of a determined type of consanguineous
marriage in a particular region, and thus
with the mean values of endogamy. It must
be noted that the most efficient way to do

this would be through an analysis of the
genealogies of each type of marriage (Barrat,
1961); but this could not be done because
the genealogical data available to us were
not complete. An analysis of the reasons for
dispensation can only be viewed as a first
approximation, as the ecclesiastical legislative reasons may not always agree with the

are interesting; in the first and third decade
the observed number is lower than the
expected, while the inverse occurs during
the fifth decade, especially in the urban
zone. The number of moral reasons observed is higher than expected, but without
predominance of one zone over the others.
On the other hand, economic and geographic

real causes determined by the social and
biological environment (Pinto-Cisternas
and Moroni, 1967.)

For these reasons, the analysis (Table 7)
was restricted to a comparison of the
observed and expected numbers of reasons
for dispensations in only three decades and
by distributing these reasons according to
their frequency from high to low. The frequency of psychological and judicial reasons

reasons predominate in the rural zone where
the observed number is clearly higher than
the expected one.

This behavior may stem from the fact
that judicial and psychological reasons are
given generically as causes for dispensations,
while the moral motives used more by
urban residents and economic and geographic ones used by rural residents reflect causes
linked more intimately to the particular

characteristics of an urban or rural population.
CONCLUSIONS

Analysis of the values of endogamy and
of the percentage of consanguineous marriages reveal these values to be decreasing
with time in the province of Valparaiso as
a whole. The same considerations can be
applied to each zone of the province. Further, these values are lower in the urban
zones than in the rural ones, thus pointing
to the urban and rural as the most contrasting zones.

The frequency of consanguineous marriages and the mean endogamy values are
very similar to those found by other authors
in South America and are in general lower
than Europe, especially Spain.

The more frequent type of consanguin

eous marriages involve first cousins or
second cousins; the lowest values are found
for the multiple type and for marriages
between uncle (or aunt) and niece (or nephew).

Judicial and chronological motives for
dispensation are more frequent in the urban
zone, while geographic and economic ones
have a higher incidence in the rural zone.
