Effects of Unstable Sexual Unions on

Fertility in Guayaquil, Ecuador

There have been many arguments among
students of Caribbean and Latin American
demography on whether the instability of
sexual unions enhances or suppresses fertility. A comparison of various countries
reveals that the directions of difference in
fertility by type of union often conflict
(Miro, 1966). For some populations, fertility is higher for the consensually married
(Caracas, Mexico City, and Rio de Janeiro). For others, it is lower (Bogota, San
Jose, Buenos Aires). Mortara (1961) finds
that differences in proportions of consensual
unions among Latin American countries
have little explanatory value for intercountry fertility differences. He concludes
that no consistent overall fertility differences exist between different types of sexual unions.

In 1955, Blake hypothesized that the instability of reproductive unions may affect
fertility in two opposite ways. On the one
hand, it may reduce the rate of reproduction by decreasing the total time of exposure to pregnancy. This reduction is the
result of interunion periods of celibacy and
periods with infrequent sexual relations as
the union is nearing its end. On the other
hand, it may increase the rate of reproduc
tion because there is often a desire to have
children born of each new union (Blake,
1955), or simply because coitus is more frequent at the beginning of each new union.

This hypothesis, if true, may account for
the seemingly conflicting results of Miro
(1966), Mortara (1961), and others. The
net effect of union instability on fertility
would be a balance of these two counteracting forces. Although there have been
many studies on the subject of union instability in relation to fertility, the two components of instability have never been studied independently. In this paper, we present
independent measurements of the effects
on fertility of these two components of instability, in order to test a modified form
of Blake’s hypothesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The source of data for this analysis is
the Urban In-Migration and Fertility Survey conducted in Guayaquil, Ecuador, in
1971 (Scrimshaw, 1973). Traditional ethnographic research preceded and contributed to the design and testing of questionnaires for a survey of approximately two
thousand urban families in the lower socioeconomic stratum. Although moderate vari

ations exist in the income level, education,
housing, etc., generally speaking, it is a
relatively homogeneous sample.

The data from the survey include information from a probability cluster sample
of women, ages 15 to 49, single and married, concerning their reproductive history,
sexual union history, employment history,
knowledge, attitude and use of contraceptives, nutrition and beliefs about food, and
migration history for urban in-migrants.
The survey also collected similar information from men currently involved in a sexual union with a woman in the sample. Of
particular importance to the present study,
the survey obtained complete sexual-union
histories of all women and men in the sample, including data on the dates of the initiation and dissolution of all their sexual
unions as well as number of children born
in each union. Our analysis was confined
to the subsample of women who were currently in a sexual union at the time of the
survey, and their spouses, if interviewed.

In previous studies on this subject, differential stability was frequently measured
by the type of current union: legal marriages were considered the most stable;
common-law unions were considered less
stable; and, visiting relations were considered the least stable (Stycos, 1955; Onaka
and Yaukey, 1973). There are several
limitations in using type of union to indicate union stability.

Usually the data differentiate between
legal, common law, and visiting relations
only for the person’s most recent sexual
union, Thus, a woman who entered more
than one union is placed in the consensualunion category if her last union was consensual even though her preceding union
may have been legal. In fact, a number of
studies have indicated that an adult may
typically pass through three types of mating relationships: visiting, common law,
and marriage (Nag, 1971; Yaukey and

Chen, Wishik, and Scrimshaw

Social Biology

Thorsen, 1972). Thus, a person classified
as married may have gone through a number of sexual unions and suffered from significant loss in reproductive time. Therefore, it would be misleading to study the
fertility differentials among the three types
of union and draw inferences on the relationship between union stability and fertility.

In the present study, we consider a person’s mating career as less stable if she (he)
passes through many unions in her (his)
lifetime and suffers from heavy loss in reproductive time. Hence, we measure the
stability of unions by the number of unions
a person has had and by the years of reproductive time he or she has lost. If Blake’s
hypothesis is true, we expect that (1)
among people who have had the same number of unions, those who experienced more
loss in reproductive time will have a lower
fertility; and (2) among people who have
lost the same amount of reproductive time,
those who entered more unions have a
higher fertility.

Fertility is measured by the number of
children ever born and children ever fathered for women and men respectively.
Since members of the study population are
all currently in union, those who had been
in only one union by definition have been
in an uninterrupted union and hence have
had no loss in reproductive time. Among
those who have ever had two unions, a
sizable portion entered the second union in
the same year the first union dissolved.
Their interunion time loss was negligible
(less than one year).

People who have had two unions suffered from an interunion reproductive time
lost. The effect of such a loss on fertility
obviously is strongly linked to when the loss
occurred. A one-year loss at the age of 20
may have the similar effect on fertility as a
three-year loss which occurred at the age of
35, depending on the age-specific marital

fertility rates of the women in the population. For the purpose of our study, we
weighted the interunion time loss by a factor denoting the relative fertility rate at the
time the loss occurred (Table 1). Therefore,

for a 40-year-old woman, loss of one year at
the age of 19 would give her a weighted loss
of one year; loss of one year at the age of
26 would give her a weighted loss of 0.78
year.

The interval between marriage and the
first birth is considerably shorter than the
intervals between subsequent births. Reproductive time lost occurs after the first
union, and on the average, after the first
birth. Hence it is the interval for subsequent births that we should apply. Knowing the proportion of first births among
women at different age groups, we were
able to remove the disturbing effect of the
uneven distribution of first births on agespecific marital fertility before we constructed the weights (Wolfers, 1974).

A small number of people professed to
have had three or more unions. They are
excluded from Tables 2 and 3 since there
are not enough cases for the breakdown

RESULTS

Tables 2 and 3 show the fertility of Ecuadorian men and women by the number of
sexual unions they have had and by the
weighted years of reproductive time lost.
All the tabulations are controlled for the
number of years elapsed since a person entered into the first sexual union, which we
shall call the “alliance span.” All the averages of children ever born are standardized
by the alliance-span composition of the

pared with people with two unions and
negligible loss in reproductive time (less
than one year). Our assumption is that the
difference in fertility between these two
groups is due to the number of unions they
have had. The first column in Table 2
shows that the average number of children
a man has is increased by 0.5 children
(from 4.6 to 5.1) when a second union is
formed. Controlling for the loss in reproductive time and the alliance span, one
additional union brought the fertility up
11.2 per cent. The experience of women is
somewhat different from that of the men
(Table 3, Column 1). Fertility is not significantly different between those with one
union and those with two. The average
number of children born is 4.66 for the
former, and 4.5 for the latter.

Another attempt is made at examining
the impact of additional unions on fertility.

unions (alliance span minus interunion
waiting time) and by the number of unions
they have had. Table 4 shows that when
the duration of pregnancy exposure is controlled, the first additional union increases
the average number of children ever born
by 14 per cent (or 0.5 children). The subsequent additions increase the fertility by
15~16 per cent (or 0.6 children). The remarkable consistency between male and female data lends us confidence in our conclusion that there is a positive relation
between fertility and the number of unions
a person has had when the duration of
pregnancy exposure is controlled.

To analyze the relationship between fertility and reproductive time lost, we have
limited our observations to men and women
with two sexual unions only, since all those
with one union have not suffered any reproductive time lost. The lower half of Table
2 shows that among the men with two
unions, increasing reproductive time lost
consistently has a negative effect on fer
tility. Those losing less than one year, 1-3
years, and 3-6 years of their reproductive
time have an average number of 5.1, 4.5,
and 3.7 children, respectively. Therefore,
for every weighted year of loss in reproductive time, there is an average loss of
0.35 children. These data seem to suggest
that factors leading to increased fertility
when new unions are formed could compensate approximately 1.4 years loss in reproductive time for the Ecuadorian men.
This relationship between fertility and
reproductive time lost among the female
population is not clearly observed. While
there is a negative correlation between reproductive time lost and number of children born among the high-loss groups, such
a correlation does not appear among women
who suffered little loss in reproductive time.
Women with 1~3 years of loss have 5.2 children, which is 0.7 children more than
women with negligible loss in reproductive
time (Table 3). We find no single satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Union instability manifests itself through
increased reproductive time lost and a
greater number of unions entered into by
an individual during the course of a lifetime. We have examined independently the
impact of each of these factors on fertility
in Guayaquil, Ecuador.

When we control for the number of
unions, we find among men a negative correlation between fertility and years of reproductive time lost. However, the evidence
among the female population is not conclusive. Women with less than one year of
loss have 0.7 children fewer than women
with 1-3 years of loss. This is a significant
difference which cannot be explained by
sampling error. One possible explanation
lies in the possibility that women with time
loss of less than one year stayed in an unhappy union, toward the end of which sexual intercourse had become infrequent,
until they were ready to enter another
union. As our data show, the fertility rate
per exposure year during the first union
(births divided by the duration of that
union) is significantly lower among these
women than the rate among those women
who have lost more reproductive time.

When we control for years spent in union
(Table 4), people who have had two unions
have a fertility 14 per cent higher than
those who have had only one. People who
have had three or more unions have a fertility 15 per cent higher than those who
have had two. Similar results are observed
among both the male and female populations. These findings support the hypothesis
that multiplicity of sexual unions has a
positive effect on fertility.

The multiplicity of unions would have a
positive effect on fertility if there is a desire for children in each new union. Insofar
as the Ecuadorian man desires any of the
rewards for parenthood, he must have children in his present union because the chil
Social Biology

dren born in past unions are normally not
attached to him. Although the law requires
economic responsibility for all children,
including those from a previous union, men
sometimes evade this by deserting their
mates. They do not experience the pressure
of too many offspring as frequently as
women do. Because they do not wish to be
childless, and because children are a convenient and effective means of assuring a
woman’s fidelity and dependence, men tend
to desire children in the current union.

Women also view offspring as a means
for promoting constancy and fidelity in
their spouses. However, the desire for children in the current union seems to be
stronger among men and is initiated by
them. After the dissolution of unions,
women have to worry more about the financial burden of childrearing. Therefore, it is
not surprising that they are more in favor
of family limitation than men; their desired family size is smaller than that of
men, and a larger proportion of them
wished they had had fewer children
(Scrimshaw 1973). However, they do have
to accommodate themselves to the men’s
desire for children and comply with it,
since women are by no means independent
of men for support and status (see Blake,
1961 for a similar situation in Jamaica).

However, the effect of a desire for children on fertility is potential rather than
actual. If women in the study population
habitually used contraception or abortion,
the wish to have children in each new union
would tend to increase fertility. If contraception or abortion was not widely practiced, the role of multiple unions in bringing
about such a result may be quite limited.
It is necessary for us to examine the prevalence of these practices in the study population.

Five per cent of the women admitted to
having had induced abortions. A quarter
of the women are currently using some

form of contraception. The four most
popular methods are the pill (6.5 per cent),
tubectomy (5 per cent), coitus interruptus
(5 per cent), and rhythm (5 per cent).
In view of the large portion of women who
are not using any or are using ineffective
methods of contraception, we think it is
doubtful that a desire by couples to have
children within the current union has an
observable effect on fertility. The positive
effect of multiple unions on fertility we
observed possibly is a result of increased
coital frequency when new unions are
formed. Unfortunately, data directly
bearing on this hypothesis are not available.

Union instability is not a single concept,
but rather two. It manifests itself through
the multiplicity of unions and through

reproductive time lost. When one talks
about the effect of union “instability” on
fertility, one should speak separately of the
opposing effects on fertility of these two
manifestations. In societies where people
enter new unions soon after the dissolution
of a previous union, instability will have a
positive effect upon fertility. In societies
where people spend a long time in interunion or postunion celibacy, instability will
tend to reduce fertility.
