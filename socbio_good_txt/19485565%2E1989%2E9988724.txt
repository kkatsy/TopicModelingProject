Mean Age and Life Expectancy at Birth
in Stationary Populations: Research Note

The aim of this note is to show the
conditions under which mean ages and
life expectancies at birth in stationary
populations stay in different order.

Let’s assume that the mean age of a
stationary population A is greater than
that of another stationary population B.
Does it mean that the life expectancy at
birth for A 1s also greater than that for
B?

The aim of this note is to show the
conditions under which the above questions would have a negative answer.

In 1977 Stephen W. Salant demonstrated that for unemployment spells in
a situation of stationary unemployment
(what he calls “‘stable economic conditions”, page 40):

 

 

“E(T,) > E(T»)
and
Var(S,) Var(S)
— ———— > E(T,) — E(7»)
2E(S,)  2E(S»)
This would imply that

E(S,) < E(S»)”’ (page 43, Note 10)
where T is the duration of the inter
 

 

rupted spells of unemployment and S of
the complete spells.

In the demographic chart, T corresponds to the age of individuals at a given
moment (census) and S to the age at
death of that individuals. E(7) would
then be the mean age of the population,
E(S) the life expectancy at birth and
Var(S) the variance corresponding to
the ages at the time of death.

If the mean age in A is greater than
that in B and the difference in the variation coefficients at the time of death in
stationary populations A and B is more
than double the difference of the age averages, the order of life expectancy at
birth would then be reversed.

Salant’s analysis is a far cry from the
techniques and the language usually employed in demography. However, I believe that this result could be of some interest for demographers.
