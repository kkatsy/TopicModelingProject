ABSTRACT: This study examines trends in proximate determinants of fertility in Zimbabwe and
Kenya. Findings from the four Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in these countries
show that the dramatic fall in fertility in these countries is consistent with the underlying trends
in the most important proximate determinants of fertility. In Zimbabwe, contraceptive use far
exceeds other proximate determinants in influencing fertility levels and trends. The results show
that the fertility inhibiting effects of contraception are more important than the effects of postpartum infecundability, marriage patterns, or sterility. The results also show that contraceptive
use has its greatest suppressing effects in the middle and younger age groups. However, in
Kenya, the dominant fertility inhibiting effect is postpartum infecundability, with contraception

coming in second.

The dramatic decline in fertility in
Zimbabwe and Kenya in the last few
years has been well documented and has
prompted both scholars and policymakers
to ask why the decline has occurred. Besides the well-known correlates of fertility
decline, such as high levels of education,
low levels of infant and child mortality,
and reasonably sound economies, a strong
family planning program which has resulted in substantial contraceptive use in
these countries is also a popular explanation (Kirk and Pillet, 1998; Caldwell et
al., 1992). In Zimbabwe, use of modern
contraceptives among married women has
steadily increased from 27 per cent in
1984 to 36 per cent in 1988, and then to
42 per cent in 1994 (CSO and Macro International Inc., 1995). In Kenya, use of
modern methods rose from 11 per cent in
1977-78 to 14.1 per cent in 1984, to 24.1
per cent in 1989, and peaked at an all
82

time high of 34 per cent in 1993 (National
Council for Population and Development,
1994). A series of national surveys conducted in Kenya show that the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 8.1 births per
woman in the mid-1970’s (Kenya Fertility
Survey) to 7.7 in 1984 (Kenya CPS) and
then to 6.7 and 5.4 in 1989 and 1993
(Kenya DHS I and II, respectively). In
Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Reproductive
and Health Survey of 1984 estimated a
TFR of 6.5, and two rounds of DHS surveys conducted in 1988-89 and 1994
yielded TFR’s of 5.4 and 4.3, respectively.
In both countries, it appears that the fertility decline gathered momentum beginning
in the early 1980's.

The fertility decline that has taken
place in Zimbabwe and Kenya makes
these countries interesting case studies
for examining the role of the proximate
determinants of fertility in sub-Saharan

Africa. This study will identify the factors
which have had the greatest impact on fertility. For instance, is the sharp fall in total
fertility in these countries consistent with
the underlying trends in the most important proximate determinants of fertility,
like a rise in contraceptive use and postponement of marriage? In addition, this
paper offers us the opportunity to identify
important sign posts which point toward a
sustained fertility decline in these countries. According to van de Walle and Foster (1990, p. 9), if one wishes to identify
the beginning of a sustained decline in
completed family size, distinct from mere
short-term fluctuations in fertility or reporting errors, then one should examine a
variety of indicators for evidence. In particular, one should look for (1) a conclusive drop in the level of fertility using
comparable surveys; (2) a significant rise
in the use of efficient contraceptives, particularly among age groups experiencing
fertility decline; and (3) a conclusive drop
in fertility intentions.

Historical studies of fertility transition
have shown that as societies begin to undergo the transformation from natural to
deliberately controlled fertility, significant changes in the overall levels of total
natural marital fertility (TN), total marital
fertility (TM) and total fertility (TFR) begin to occur. Such changes can be traced
to one or several proximate factors such
as an increase in contraceptive use for
stopping and spacing purposes, a rise in
age at first marriage, a decline in the proportion married, prolonged breast-feeding,
and increased induced abortion. Unfortunately, because of data limitation, it is not
always possible to examine changes associated with these proximate determinants
of fertility over time. In the cases of
Kenya and Zimbabwe, however, we are

Reproductive Change 83

able to examine the relative changes over
time in the effects of the proximate determinants of fertility because the two
rounds of DHS surveys conducted in each
country provide us with the necessary
data. However, the analysis is restricted
to the time period 1988-1994.

This study focuses on three of the four
primary proximate determinants _ that
Bongaarts (1982) and Bongaarts and Potter (1983) identify as having a significant
effect on fertility, namely, marriage patterns, contraceptive use, and postpartum
infecundability. A fourth proximate factor, primary sterility, will also be analyzed. Aside from the main determinants
named above, Bongaarts and Potter
(1983) include permanent sterility, frequency of intercourse, and spontaneous
intrauterine mortality as factors of secondary importance. Fertility levels are
not very sensitive to changes associated
with these later proximate determinants
because they do not vary much across
populations. In this study, the effect of
induced abortion is not examined because
induced abortion has a negligible effect
on fertility levels and because of rare
and unreliable statistics for induced
abortions in Zimbabwe and Kenya or
anywhere else in sub-Saharan Africa
(Bongaarts et al., 1984). I will therefore
study primary sterility instead. Because
of the well-established pattern of pathological sterility in certain countries like
Cameroon, Congo, and the Central
African Republic, and because the levels
of sterility vary markedly between these
countries and other parts of the subcontinent, this proximate determinant is
therefore a potentially important fertility inhibitor (Page, 1988; Romaniuk,
1968; Frank, 1983; Larsen and Menken,
1989).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for this analysis are drawn
from the 1988-89 and 1994 Zimbabwe
DHS and the 1988 and 1993 Kenya DHS.
The samples for these four surveys were
national in scope. By using these four
data sets, we will be able to examine how
the four proximate determinants influenced fertility levels during the first
round of DHS surveys and compare these
results to the effects in the second round
of DHS surveys. This comparison will allow us to illustrate the different effects of
each factor on fertility over time in each
country.

In order to quantify the effects of each
proximate factor on fertility, Bongaarts
developed the following formula:

TFR =TF*Cm*Cc*Ci*Ip — [1]

In the original model, Bongaarts has
an index of induced abortion (Ca) instead
of Ip, the index of sterility. The calculation of Ip is based on a 3 per cent standard rate of childlessness in developing
countries that was established by Frank
(1983) and Bongaarts et al. (1984). This
rate refers to the lowest level of natural
fertility (3 per cent), which occurs in
women’s early 20’s. Hence, this figure
provides us with the lowest proportion of
women one would expect to be childless
until menopause in societies with universal marriage. Jolly and Gribble (1993)
note additionally that if the rate of childlessness exceeds 3 per cent, Jp will have a
value less than 1, indicating that it reduces fertility. However, if less than 3 per
cent of women age 40-49 are childless,
Ip will have a value greater than 1. If the
last condition holds, it indicates that levels of primary sterility will be lower than

Sibanda

 

Social Biology

would be expected in a developing country. The index of sterility is to be estimated as

7.63 — 0.11 *s
7.3

a (2]

where s is the proportion of women aged
40-49 who have never had any children.
The lower age limit for probable levels of.
infertility is set at 40 in sub-Saharan
Africa since it is widely assumed that
most women in sub-Saharan African fertility regimes would have had their first
birth by the time they turn 40 years (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983; Bongaarts et al.,
1984). This contention is based on the
observation that at older ages, most
women tend to have irregular and infrequent ovulation which is coupled by the
aging of the reproductive system and increasingly lower frequencies of intercourse.

Cm is the index of marriage which is
intended to measure the effect on fertility
of the proportion of women in a sexual
union. The effect of marriage on fertility
is captured as the ratio of the average
number of children a woman _ bears
throughout her life to the number she
would have if she first entered union at
age 15 and stayed in that union until she
reached menopause. Cm equals 1 if all
women of reproductive age are in union
and 0 when none are in union. However, it
is important to note that the value of Cm
can be greater than 1 if there are many
births that occur outside union. For example, the value of Cm is likely to be greater
than 1 in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa
since an appreciable proportion of births
occur to unmarried women (Bongaarts et
al., 1984; Jolly and Gribble, 1993). If
these nonmarital births are excluded in

Vol. 46, No. 1-2

the calculation of Cm, the TFR would be
underestimated while the total marital
fertility rate would be accurately estimated. On the other hand, the total marital fertility rate would be inflated if these
nonmarital births are included, thereby
giving a false impression that marriage
patterns reduce fertility by a larger fraction than they actually do. To avoid this
problem and to maintain a consistent definition for the other variables in Bongaarts’ model, Jolly and Gribble (1993)
propose the addition of another variable,
Mo. This new variable captures the effect
on total fertility of nonmarital births. It
relates total fertility calculated by using
all births to total fertility calculated by
using births only to women in marriage.
Cm*, a modified version of Cm, captures
the effect on total fertility of the specific
observed union pattern under the assumption that no births occur outside marriage.
The product of Mo and Cm* is Cm,
which captures Bongaarts’ definition of
the effects of marriage patterns on fertility. The index of marriage is to be calculated as follows:

CM = total fertility rate (TFR)
total marital fertility rate (TMFR)

[3]

where TFR is the average number of children that would be born to a cohort of girl
babies who survive to the end of their reproductive period and are subject at each
age to the observed age-specific rates of
bearing children and TMFR is the average
total number of births a woman in union
from age 15 to 49 would have at current
age-specific marital fertility rates. The total marital fertility rate is estimated for
women currently in union. The two fertility rates are estimated for the 5 years
prior to the survey.

The estimation of TUFR is complicated by the fact that the DHS data for
Zimbabwe and Kenya do not have complete marriage histories, making it impossible to estimate lengths of marital disruption. To overcome this problem, Jolly
and Gribble suggest that we assume that
there is no marital disruption from the
date of first union if the woman is still
married at the time of the survey. This assumption is based on the fact that most
marital disruptions in sub-Saharan Africa
are fairly short since most women remarry quickly; hence they do not spend a
lot of time without being exposed to the
risk of getting pregnant (Bongaarts et al.,
1984; Mhloyi, 1988). Thus, if there are
any births that occur during a period of
marital disruption, there will not be a serious overestimation of the TUFR. On the
other hand, the effect of childbearing outside union on fertility (fo) can be estimated if we assume that births to women
whose status at the time of the survey is
divorced or widowed occurred outside,

and this assumption also leads to an underestimation of TUFR.

The index of contraception, Cc, measures the effect of contraception on the
risk of conception. The index equals 1 if
no form of contraception is used and 0 if
all fecund women use modern methods
that are 100 per cent effective. This index
will be calculated as follows:

Cc = 1— 1.08 *u*e [7]
where u is the current contraceptive use
prevalence rate among women in sexual
union and e is the average use-effectiveness
of contraception which is calculated as the
weighted average of the following methodspecific use-effectiveness levels:

Contraceptive Use-effectiveness
method rate (e)

Pill 0.90

IUD 0.95
Sterilization 1.00

Other modern methods 0.70
Traditional methods 0.30

These use-effectiveness levels are

adopted from Bongaarts and Potter (1983).
These weights are, in effect, equal to the
proportion of women using a given
method. Bongaarts and Potter introduced
a coefficient of 1.08 to Equation 7 to adjust for the fact that if women know that
they are sterile, they will not use any
form of contraception. In other words,
the 1.08 coefficient adjusts for the proportion of women who are fecund, a phenomenon which varies with age.

The index of postpartum infecundability, Ci, measures the effects of postpartum amenorrhea and abstinence on fertility. The index equals 1 in the absence of
lactation and postpartum abstinence and

 

Social Biology

0 when infecundability is permanent. The
index of postpartum infecundability is
calculated as

20

[8]
18.5 +i

Ci =

where i is the average number of months
of postpartum infecundability for currently married women, which is estimated
as the number of mothers either amenorrheic or abstaining at the time of the survey (prevalence) divided by the mean
number of births per month over the last
three years (incidence). Bongaarts and
Potter contend that in the absence of
breast-feeding and sexual abstinence, the
four components of a typical birth interval
would add up to 20 months, made up of
the following components: postpartum
anovulation (1.5 months), the waiting
time to conception (7.5 months), spontaneous intrauterine mortality (2 months),
and the average length of a full-term pregnancy (9 months). However, the average
length of a birth interval can be shortened
to 18.5 months in the presence of breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence.

This study will provide estimates of
these proximate determinants across age
groups for Kenya and Zimbabwe using
the four DHS surveys. Age-specific estimates will allow us to identify where the
greatest reductive effects of each proximate determinant have occurred.

OF FERTILITY

As demonstrated in Equation 1, the
observed levels of fertility in a population
are a product of the relationship of proxi

mate determinants and the biological
maximum level of fertility (7FR =
TF*Cm*Cc*Ci*Ip). The total fecundity
rate (TF) has been observed to vary from
13 to 17 births per woman, with an average of about 15.3 (Bongaarts, 1982).

Table 1 presents the estimates of the
proximate determinants derived from the
1988 and 1994 Zimbabwe DHS surveys
while Table 2 presents similar results for
Kenya for the years 1988 and 1993.
These estimates for various age groups of
the population allow one to examine how
changes in the levels of fertility over time
in a population are caused by changes in
one Or more proximate determinants.

MARRIAGE

A comparison of the estimates for
Zimbabwe and Kenya reveals that at the
national level, the fertility-inhibiting effect of marriage increased between
1988-94 and 1988-93. In Zimbabwe, Cm
was 0.81 in 1988 and 0.79 in 1994, and in
Kenya, Cm also dropped from 0.86 to
0.83 between 1988 and 1993. Similar
changes are also noted for the adjusted
index of marriage, Cm*. In Zimbabwe
the values for Cm* are 0.71 (ZDHS-1)
and 0.68 (ZDHS-II), while in Kenya, the
values are 0.72 (KDHS-1) and 0.67
(KDHS-II). These indexes imply that if
childbearing was confined to marital
unions and if all women marry and stay
married between the ages 15-49, the TFR
would have increased by 29 per cent and
32 per cent in 1988 and 1994 in Zimbabwe. In Kenya the TFR would have increased by 28 per cent and 33 per cent in

1988 and 1993, respectively. On the other.

hand, a comparison of the effects of marital patterns by age shows that in both
countries, the greatest fertility reducing
effect of marriage patterns (both Cm and

Reproductive Change

87

Cm*) is found at the younger ages
(15~19 and 20-24), and the effect is low
at the middle and older ages where most
women are expected to be in some kind
of marital or sexual union.

A look at the effect of births outside
union reveals an interesting trend in both
countries. At the national level, the TFR
in Zimbabwe was 14 per cent higher in
1988 than it would have been if all childbearing was confined to the institution of
marriage. By 1994, the effect of Mo was
1.16, implying that the 7FR would have
been 16 per cent lower than it would have
been if only births in union were used instead of using all births regardless of
marital status. In Kenya, a similar trend is
also observed. In 1988 the TFR was 19
per cent higher that it would have been if
all childbearing was a privilege enjoyed
by women in unions only. By 1993, the
TFR had increased by 24 per cent. What
this finding seems to suggest is that more
and more women are having children outside marriage, a transformation which
normally accompanies change in the institution of the family as it relates to societal approval (expectations) of marital
fertility as opposed to nonmarital fertility.
In most parts of sub-Saharan Africa,
childbearing is sanctioned mostly through
marriage.

A look at the age groups offers us
some important clues as to where these
increases in non-marital births have been
occurring. It is very clear from the surveys in both countries that the increase in
nonmarital fertility occurred across all
age groups. However, the biggest effects
of these non-marital births to total fertility can be noted for women aged 15-19
(which is a reflection of increased teenage pregnancy and not necessarily teen
marital fertility) and age 20-24. Because

of the large Mo values we have in Zimbabwe and Kenya, fairly substantial variations are noted when we compare Cm*
and Cm. This finding means that when
one estimates the fertility inhibiting effect of union patterns using births in
union only, the potential to underestimate
the overall effect of Cm on total fertility
is huge. For example, in Zimbabwe Cm is
0.81 as compared to a Cm* value of 0.71
(1988), and in 1994 Cm was 0.79 as compared to a Cm* value of 0.68. In Kenya,
Cm was 0.86 versus a Cm* value of 0.72
in 1988, and by 1993 these two indexes
had dropped to 0.83 and 0.67, respectively. Thus, in both countries the lower
values of Cm* as compared to Cm suggest that union patterns have a fairly large
effect in reducing fertility. A rise in age at
marriage and an increase in the number
of women not in union are the primary
causes for the lower Cm’s.

CONTRACEPTION

Analysis of change associated with
contraceptive use helps us examine in
some limited way whether any increase
in the fertility-inhibiting effects of contraception constitute evidence of what
Coale (1973) postulated as the necessary
conditions for a fertility decline to start:
(1) fertility is within the calculus of conscious choice; (2) lower fertility is seen
as advantageous; and (3) effective means
of birth control are readily available and
couples are willing to use them. The idea
of using contraception to achieve certain
family targets also ties in nicely with van
de Walle’s (1992) concept of numeracy.

The DHS surveys done in Zimbabwe
and Kenya have shown that women in
these countries have easy access to means
of limiting their fertility (contraception)
and that they are using these contracep

tives either to space or limit births unlike
women in other parts of sub-Saharan
Africa. The motivation to limit family
size has been growing and this has to do
with the increasing costs of raising and
educating children and the need to improve women’s health (Kelley and
Nobbe, 1990; Jolly and Gribble, 1993;
Mhloyi, 1994). In addition, large numbers of women in these societies seem to
understand the concept of numeracy
since the majority of them can express
the number of children they desire to
have in terms of numbers. In other words,
women in these two societies have the
frame of mind and a clear numerical standard that gives them the leverage necessary to make “sense of small families and
the means to obtain them” (van de Walle,
1992, p. 496). The fact that more and
more women in these societies can express the number of children they would
like to have, coupled with the fact that
women in places like Kenya have greater
control of their reproductive behavior and
preferences than their husbands, can be
interpreted as evidence of the fact that
fertility is now within the calculus of
conscious choice (Ezeh, 1993). For instance, of the women who gave numeric
responses to questions on ideal family
size (93 per cent and 99 per cent in
ZDHS-I and ZDHS-I, respectively, and
96 per cent and 94 per cent in KDHS-I
and KDHS-I, respectively), the average
ideal number of children dropped from
4.9 to 4.4 between 1988 and 1994 in
Zimbabwe, and in Kenya it declined from
4.4 in 1988 to 3.7 in 1993 (CSO and
Macro International, Inc., 1995; National
Council for Population, 1994). It can also
be argued that numeracy about children
can lead to effective spacing of births,
which could lead to declines in fertility.

This effect is conceivable if numeracy
can help women set desired or ideal family size and use efficient contraceptives to
attain that size.

Table 1 clearly shows that, at the national level, contraception has the
largest fertility inhibitive effect in Zimbabwe when compared to the other
three proximate factors. Between 1988
and 1994, the index of contraception increased in strength from 0.63 to 0.58.
On the other hand, in Kenya contraception is not as effective in limiting fertility when compared to the effects of
postpartum infecundability. Between
1988 and 1993, the index values of contraception dropped from 0.80 to 0.73. A
comparison of the two countries shows
that contraception is playing a bigger
role in the fertility transition in Zimbabwe. It is surprising to note that the
fertility-inhibiting effect of Ci observed
for women aged 15-19 in Zimbabwe in
1988 was even stronger than that for
any age group of women in Kenya in
1988. In fact, the national Cc index was
higher (weaker) in Kenya than the Cc
index value at age 15-19 in Zimbabwe
in either 1988 or 1994.

The strong fertility-inhibiting effects
of contraception we note among women
in their prime childbearing ages are due
to the use of contraception for spacing,
while at the older ages (40-49) the
strengthening Cc values suggest that
women are using contraception for stopping child bearing. It is important to note
here that the inhibitive effects of contraception have been gaining strength across
all age groups which helps to explain
why declines in fertility noted in these
two countries appear to be pervasive
across all age groups, especially among
recent birth cohorts (Sibanda, 1997). One

Reproductive Change

91

can argue that such changes can only occur after people become amenable to the
idea of spacing and limiting their fertility
through use of effective contraceptives
which are readily available.

POSTPARTUM INFECUNDABILITY (PPI)

In both Kenya and Zimbabwe, the period of postpartum amenorrhea is longer
than the period of postpartum abstinence.
As a result, the period of postpartum
amenorrhea is used as the principal determinant of the length of postpartum infecundability. Table 3 presents median durations, in months, of breast-feeding,
postpartum amenorrhea, abstinence, and
their combined effects for insusceptibility. The duration of breast-feeding is
longer in Kenya than in Zimbabwe by
about two months. However, median durations of breast-feeding have changed
very little between the two rounds of
DHS surveys in each country. Thus, we
seem to have the coexistence of long median breast-feeding durations with declines in fertility. This finding strengthens
the contention that “fertility declines
are not necessarily associated with significant changes in breast-feeding behavior”
(Casterline, 1994, p. 75). On the other
hand, women in Zimbabwe are postpartum amenorrheic for slightly more than a
year, while women in Kenya are postpartum amenorrheic for less than 11 months.
The table also shows that in both countries the median durations of postpartum
abstinence are very short (less than 5
months), although women in Zimbabwe
have slightly longer periods of abstinence
than their counterparts in Kenya. Lastly,
in terms of the overall period of insusceptibility, the median durations show that
this period is longer in Zimbabwe than in
Kenya.

An examination of PPI values in Tables 1 and 2 show that PPI plays a very
important role in determining levels of
fertility in these two countries. The fertility transition that is underway has been
accompanied by the strengthening of the
fertility-inhibiting impact of PPI. This
pattern is different from that suggested by
Bongaarts and Potter (1983) who contend
that a typical movement from natural to
controlled fertility is usually accompanied by a shortening of PPI. However, in
the case of Zimbabwe and Kenya, the relative importance of PP/ has not decreased between the periods of 1988-94
and 1988-93 respectively. A Ci index of
0.56 in Kenya in 1993 indicates the
strong effect of long postpartum insusceptible periods on fertility. Table 2 also
shows that in both rounds of KDHS
surveys, Ci had the largest fertilityinhibiting effect of all proximate factors
in the country. In other words, the relative
importance of postpartum infecundability
in reducing potential fertility was substantially larger than that of any proximate determinant in Kenya. This finding
is consistent with results from other parts
of sub-Saharan Africa where marriage
has been shown to be more important
than contraception in restricting potential
total fecundity when fertility levels are
still high (Rutstein, 1991). In contrast,
postpartum infecundability was second in
importance as an inhibitor to contracep
tion in Zimbabwe in both 1988 and 1994.

The results presented in Tables 1 and 2
also show that in the late 1980’s, Ci was
less important as an influence on lowering
fertility, while in the early 1990’s the Ci
index gained significance. It is important
to note that this gain occurred at a time
when use of modern contraceptives was
on the increase in these two societies. The
only difference between Zimbabwe and
Kenya is that the fertility-inhibiting effects of breast-feeding patterns appear to
be strong at the youngest ages in Zimbabwe, while in Kenya breast-feeding
patterns have their greatest reductive effect in the older age groups.

PRIMARY STERILITY

The values of the index of sterility, Jp
shown in Tables 1 and 2 only take into
account the incidence of primary sterility.
Since Ip ts based on a 3 per cent standard
rate of childlessness in developing countries (Frank, 1983; Bongaarts et al.,
1984), the value of Jp will be less than 1
if the proportion of childless women at
age 40-49 exceeds this standard rate. Under such circumstances, /p has the potential to inhibit fertility. By contrast, if the
value of Jp is greater than 1, the proportion childless at age 40-49 will be less
than the standard childlessness rate of 3
per cent. Such a scenario is normally
taken as evidence of the underestimation
of the proportion of women childless in a

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

Vol. 46, No. 1-2

developing society. Jp values greater than
1 are therefore difficult to interpret in the
broader context of the Bongaarts and Potter proximate determinant framework. A
value greater than 1 implies that fertility
can be increased by low levels of pathological sterility. As a solution, if the Jp index is greater than 1, it is simply reduced
to 1 so that it can conform with the general interpretation of the other indexes of
the proximate determinants framework.
Thus, an /p value of 1 indicates that the
level of sterility does not inhibit fertility
while an Jp value of 0 means that pathological sterility does inhibit fertility below its theoretical maximum. In situations where the value of /p is less than
the 3 per cent standard rate, it is most
likely due to substantial under-reporting
of childlessness or pathological sterility.
The stigma associated with childlessness
is well documented in many African societies, so it is possible that the incidence
of this phenomenon might be under reported (Caldwell and Caldwell, 1987;
Larsen, 1989). On the other hand, it is
also possible that improvements in reproductive health and diet could have lowered the levels of pathological sterility to
levels lower than the suggested 3 per cent
standard rate.

A comparison of Jp values in Tables 1
and 2 clearly shows that in both Kenya
and Zimbabwe (with the exception of
ZDHS-II), the proportions of women
childless at age 40-49 were less than the
3 per cent standard rate. In 1988 and
1993, 2.3 per cent and 1.8 per cent of
ever-married women aged 40-49 were
childless in Kenya, and in Zimbabwe the
percentages for 1988 and 1994 were 2.7
per cent and 1.7 per cent, respectively.
Thus, the results (Jp values greater than
1) suggest that pathological sterility did

Reproductive Change

93

not play a significant role in determining
the overall level of fertility in Kenya and
Zimbabwe at the time that these surveys
were taken since it did not inhibit fertility
below its theoretical maximum.

Having looked at the fertility-inhibiting
effects of these proximate determinants,
the following section tries to quantify the
effects of these proximate factors in terms
of births averted per woman.

EFFECT OF PROXIMATE DETERMINANTS
ON FERTILITY

Much of the credit for the decline in
fertility in Kenya, Zimbabwe, Botswana,
and South Africa has been attributed to
increased contraceptive use by women of
reproductive age (Caldwell et al., 1992).
This is because the marked increases in
contraceptive use seem to have gained
momentum at a time when fertility began
to decline in these societies. This section
will allow us to compare the overall effects of contraceptive use vis-a-vis other
proximate determinants toward the decline of fertility from the theoretical maximum (Jotal Fecundity) to the observed
level (Total Fertility Rate). To determine
the extent to which the four proximate
determinants outlined above account for
the decline in fertility in each country and
also for the difference in fertility between
Zimbabwe and Kenya, this section will
utilize a series of models developed by
Bongaarts and Potter (1983).

At the national level, fertility declined
in Zimbabwe by 21.8 per cent between
1988 and 1994 (from a TFR of 5.5 to
4.3). In Kenya, the TFR declined by 19.4
per cent between 1988 and 1993 (from
6.7 to 5.4). Thus, in these populations,
the fall in TFR’s is well above 10 per
cent, a figure that is usually cited in the
literature on historical fertility transitions

“The following equations are used to compute the percentage change in TFR between ZDHS-1 and ZDHS-II: Pm = C,,2/C_1 — 1 (proportional change in TFR due to change in the index of marriage); Pe = C_2/C,1 — 1 (proportional change due to a change in the index of contraception); Pi = C,2/C,1 — 1 (proportional change due to a change in the index of postpartum infecundability).

as a key threshold for entry into nonreversible decline (Coale and Watkins,
1986). In terms of the overall TFR decline in Zimbabwe, Table 4 shows that
7.9 per cent of this decline was due to an
increase in the use of contraception; 7.5
per cent, to an increase in postpartum infecundability; and 2.5 per cent, to a decrease in the proportion of women in a
sexual union. Table 5 shows the percentage of change in 7FR that was also due to
matriage or union changes, contraception
and postpartum infecundability in Kenya.
The decline in 7FR between these two
rounds of KDHS surveys was due to a 3.5
per cent decline in the proportion of
women in a sexual union (especially at
age 15-19), an 8.75 per cent decline due
to a fairly marked increase in contracep
tive use in the country, and an 18.8 per
cent decline due to an increase in the
length of the postpartum insusceptible
period. These declines can be further decomposed to establish the overall contribution of each proximate factor to the
overall reduction in fertility from its theoretical maximum to the current total fertility levels in terms of number of children per woman.

First, the following series of equations
developed by Bongaarts and Potter
(1983) will be used to calculate the effects of each proximate factor following
the specific order in which they are laid
out. This specific order is very important
because the number of births estimated
can vary if the order of these equations is
reversed (Jolly and Gribble, 1993):

Since Jp is greater than 1 in both Zimbabwe and Kenya, the effects of this index are not shown.

EFFECTS OF MARRIAGE

Tables 4 and 5 show the effects of each
index in births per woman in Zimbabwe
and Kenya. At the national level, marriage
patterns reduced fertility by about 1.3 and
by 1.2 births in Zimbabwe in 1988 and
1994. In Kenya, marriage patterns also re
duced fertility by about 1.1 births at the
time of KDHS-1 and KDHS-Il. Thus, at
the national level, marriage patterns led to
a slightly larger decline in fertility in Zimbabwe than in Kenya.

Looking at the age-specific contributions of marriage patterns to fertility decline in these two populations, we see
that the largest fertility-inhibiting effects
of union patterns are exhibited at the
youngest ages, that is, 15-19. Although
the effects of marriage patterns appear to
have slightly weakened at this age by this
time (1993, Kenya and 1994, Zimbabwe),
these patterns reduced fertility by more
than 1 birth at the time of all the 4 DHS
surveys in these countries. Tables 4 and 5
also show that the effect of union patterns
tends to diminish with age. This result is
expected at these ages because there is a
large proportion of ever-married women
in union at these ages, a feature typical of

96 Sibanda

most African societies (Mhloyi, 1988;
Bongaarts et al., 1984).

EFFECTS OF CONTRACEPTION

The effects of the very high levels of
contraceptive use in Zimbabwe are clearly
shown in Table 4. Contraceptive use
reduced fertility by about 4 births per
woman at the time of ZDHS-1 and ZDHSII. In contrast, the low levels of contraceptive use in Kenya led to a rather modest reduction in fertility by about 2 births in
1988, and by 1993 the increase in contraceptive use in the country led to a reduction of fertility by 2.5 births. In terms of
the age-specific effects of contraception, it
is also clear that the fertility-inhibiting effects of contraceptive use were at their
strongest at ages 20-24 and 25-29 in Zimbabwe and at ages 25-29 and 30-34 in
Kenya. In Zimbabwe, women who were
exposed to on-time fertility (that is, those
in the prime child bearing ages 20-24 and
25-29) reduced their fertility by slightly
more than 1 birth through contraceptive
use. In contrast, the effects of contraception were quite low at these ages in Kenya.
In 1988, there was no one group of
women in Kenya that reduced its fertility
by half a birth through contraceptive use;
and by 1993 contraceptive use only led to
a slight change in the number of births per
woman prevented (about half a birth).

It is important to note that at these
young and middle ages, there was a reduction in fertility because young women
were resorting to longer spacing durations.
At the older ages (40+), the very low
numbers of births reduced per woman due
to use of contraception seems to indicate
that contraceptive use effects for stopping
purposes have been minimal in these two
populations when compared to what has
been going on at young and middle ages. If

 

 

Social Biology

the effects were large, we would expect to
see more births being averted or sacrificed.

EFFECTS OF POSTPARTUM
INFECUNDABILITY

The negative effects of an increase in
the postpartum insusceptible period on
fertility in Kenya and Zimbabwe is also
shown in Tables 4 and 5. In Zimbabwe,
observed fertility would have increased
by about 5 births in 1988 and by about 6
births in 1994 in the absence of postpartum infecundability. In Kenya, observed
fertility would have increased by about 4
and 7 births in 1988 and 1993 in the absence of postpartum infecundability. The
age-specific patterns of postpartum infecundability show different trends in these
two societies. Table 4 shows that in Zimbabwe the effect of this index was
strongest at young and middle ages
(15-34) where it reduced fertility by more
than 1 birth at each age group. On the
other hand, the index of postpartum infecundability appears to be stronger at age
15-19 only at the time of KDHS-I where
we have a reduction in fertility of about 1
birth. However, at the time of KDHS-II,
Ci had gained in strength among women
aged 20-39 where it reduced fertility by
more than 1! birth at each age group.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, I applied the Bongaarts
and Potter model to assess and compare
changes in the relative importance of four
proximate determinants of fertility between two sets of DHS surveys conducted in Zimbabwe and Kenya. The results show that the fertility-inhibiting
effects of contraception are more important than the effects of postpartum infecundability, marriage patterns, or sterility
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 46, No. 1-2

in Zimbabwe. The results also show that
contraceptive patterns have their greatest
fertility suppressing effects in the middle
and younger age groups. However, in
Kenya, the dominant fertility-inhibiting
effect is postpartum infecundability, with
contraception coming in second. In the
case of Kenya, use of contraception
seems to inhibit fertility more at the older
age groups than at the middle and
younger age groups. It is also surprising
to note that in both countries, there was
no erosion of postpartum practices over
time. On the contrary, the inhibiting effects of postpartum infecundability on
fertility increased between the two
rounds of DHS surveys in each country.

Turning to marriage or union patterns,
the above results have also shown that
substantial changes in the suppressing effects of marriage or union patterns on fertility have been underway in Zimbabwe
and Kenya. The impact is more pronounced at the younger ages, 15-19 and
20-24, which means that early marriage—one of the most important cultural
props in the sustenance of high fertility in
sub-Saharan Africa—has been weakening. There is undoubtedly a move toward
later marriage and the timing of the first
birth in these two populations. On the
other hand, Mo increased in both countries between the surveys, indicating an
increase in nonmarital fertility.

Regarding sterility, the analysis in this
paper has shown that this proximate factor
has not inhibited fertility below its biological maximum in Zimbabwe and Kenya.
The proportions of women aged 40-49
who are childless are below the 3 per cent
standard rate of childlessness in developing countries, making the index of sterility
(Ip) above 1. However, declining trends in
infertility are not causing any apparent rise

Reproductive Change 97

in overall fertility in these two countries
because the fertility-promoting effects of
such declines are being more than offset
by the movement in the negative direction
in the other primary proximate determinants like contraception, postpartum infecundability, and marriage patterns.

This study has also attempted to quantify the effects of these proximate determinants in terms of the number of children contributed by each factor to the
decline relative to TF and the overall percentage change in TFR’s. In terms of the
latter, the above results have shown that
the single biggest drop in fertility is attributable to contraception in Zimbabwe
(accounting for about 8 per cent), while
in Kenya the largest decline in fertility
between 1988 and 1993 is due to postpartum insusceptibility (19 per cent). However, in terms of births per woman, postpartum infecundability has the largest
effect in both countries, (5.2 and 5.6
births in Zimbabwe in 1988 and 1994,
and about 4.3 and 6.8 births in Kenya in
1988 and 1993, respectively). The effects
of contraception came in second in the
two countries.

Another important finding is the fairly
marked extent to which observed levels of
fertility in Kenya and Zimbabwe can be attributed to concomitant variations in postpartum lactational infecundability, contraception, and nuptiality. Major changes in
these proximate determinants over time
will undoubtedly contribute to a clear understanding and explanation of fertility
transitions that are already underway in
these societies. Data on proximate determinants, which have become a key feature of
DHS surveys, will also allow us to monitor
the magnitude and nature of differences in
fertility in various parts of sub-Saharan
Africa as they enter the fertility transition.

We began this analysis looking for evidence of a sustained decline in fertility.
This study has shown that there was more
than a conclusive drop in fertility levels
in these two countries as evidenced by
the huge drops in total fertility rates. Fertility intentions also changed, and more
importantly there was a marked increase
in the use of efficient contraceptives, particularly at the young ages where women
are now more likely to be spacing their
births. Thus, the fertility declines currently underway in Kenya and Zimbabwe
are not mere short-term fluctuations in
fertility or reporting errors.

The findings in this paper have important policy implications. The strengthening fertility-inhibiting effects of contraception, marriage patterns (especially
changes at the young ages), and consistent prolonged breast-feeding durations
between the surveys clearly demonstrate
the positive side of having good family
planning programs like those in Zimbabwe and Kenya. The promotion of prolonged breast-feeding durations should
continue to be endorsed by governments
and program administrators since long
durations inhibit fertility and also because of the nutritional benefits of breast
milk to children. The changes in marriage
patterns at young ages are evidence of the
contribution of rising schooling levels,
especially of girls, to increasing ages at
first marriage and first birth. In addition,
the fact that pathological sterility had no
significant effect on fertility is also due to

Social Biology

the fact that there have been marked improvements in the overall health of
women. Although any declines in sterility
may cause a rise in fertility, such declines
are being offset by movement in the other
key proximate determinants of fertility.
Above all, the striking pervasive fertility
declines across all groups indicates the
dominance of birth spacing practices over
stopping. This observation should not
dampen the spirits of family planning
providers working toward the attainment
of near replacement fertility levels in
these countries or elsewhere in subSaharan Africa. I contend that in the long
run, it will be easier to convince these
women to switch from using contraceptives for birth spacing to using contraceptives to stop childbearing. The experience
gained using modern contraceptives to
space births will be invaluable to couples
who decide to stop childbearing after attaining their desired family size.
