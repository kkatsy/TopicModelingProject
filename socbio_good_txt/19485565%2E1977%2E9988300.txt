Mormon Mortality Rates in Canada

ABSTRACT: In the United States, Mormons have been shown to have lower incidence and
mortality rates of cancer and other diseases than the general population, a fact which has been
attributed to the life style prescribed by the Mormon Church, including abstinence from tobacco,
alcohol, coffee, and tea. This study examines Mormon cause-specific mortality rates in Alberta,
Canada, compared to rates for the general population of Alberta and of all Canada. Mormon
death rates for most causes were lower than those for Alberta, which are themselves lower than
Canadian rates. Mormon death rates for males were higher than for females for most causes, but
male and female death rates were more similar among Mormons than in the general population.
Causes of death for which Mormons have an average or higher than average risk are either less
frequent causes or are less clearly related to dietary habits. Mormons have disproportionately low
death rates for many causes which are not clearly related to the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, or
tea. Further research is needed on the specific effects of different life-style components and on the

possible biological selectivity of the group.

Recent studies in the United States
(Smart et al., 1974; Enstrom, 1975; Lyon
et al., 1976) have shown that members of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints (Mormon) have lower incidence and
mortality rates of cancer and other diseases than the general population. The
superior health and longer life which these
findings document are attributed to the life
style prescribed by the Mormon Church:
abstinence from tobacco, alcohol, coffee,
and tea; maintenance of a balanced and
regular diet, including roughage foods
such as whole grains; moderation in the
eating of meat; strong emphasis on regular
family life, including prohibition of multiple sex partners; regular and frequent
social contacts with programs that include
emphasis on music, dancing, drama, and
athletics. They believe that the human
body is the temple of God and subscribe to
the idea that it should be preserved in fit
condition. It is implied that if others
looked after their bodies with the care

suggested by Mormon teachings and were
the beneficiaries of such a supportive social structure, they would enjoy the same
level of good health.

Similar findings emerged from earlier
research on two other religious groups,
Jews and Seventh Day Adventists. After
Newhill (1961) showed Jewish males in
New York City to have unusually low
rates of lung cancer mortality, Seidman
(1966) and Wynder and Mantel (1966) in
New York as well as Horowitz and Enterline (1960) in Montreal produced data
which confirmed this finding and which
also showed heavy smoking to be less frequent among Jewish males than among
Catholics and Protestants. They concluded that Jews had less lung cancer because
they smoked less.

Seventh Day Adventists, a group which
forbids tobacco, alcohol, and to some extent the eating of meat, were found to
have unusually low rates of cancer,
myocardial infarction, and other serious

294.

diseases (Wynder et al., 1959; Lemon et
al., 1964; Lemon and Walden, 1966).
Again it was concluded that a life style
relatively free from tobacco and alcohol
was responsible for their lower health and
mortality risks. Although these studies
claimed to establish a link between smoking and cancer, in every study Jews,
Seventh Day Adventists, and Mormons
were found to have low incidence and
mortality rates for a wide range of diseases, not only those diseases believed to
be related to tobacco and alcohol use. It is
possible, though untested as yet, that
other aspects of life style besides smoking
and drinking may be significantly related
to the good health enjoyed by Mormons
and other groups with superior health
(Enstrom, 1975; Lyon, 1976).

This study examines mortality patterns
of Mormons in the province of Alberta,
Canada, and is the first research on Mormon mortality in a setting outside the
United States. It examines a broader range
of causes of death than did earlier studies,
which tended to focus on cancer and toa
lesser extent on coronary artery and respiratory diseases. It should be noted that
the results of the study are contaminated
by the fact that not all Mormons of record
are practicing Mormons. There is little
published information on Mormons’ observance of their church’s teachings. Enstrom (1975) estimates that from one-half
to two-thirds of Mormons adhere to Mormon regulations forbidding the use of alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea, but that in
other aspects of diet they may not be much
different from the rest of the population.
Further research is required to ascertain
differential health risks experienced by
Mormons at various commitment and
participation levels.

Mormons have lived in Alberta since
the 1890’s. In 1971 the census of Canada
counted approximately 31,000 members of
the church in Alberta, about half of the

total for the country as a whole. They
constituted less than 2 per cent of the Alberta population in that year. Although
they were originally concentrated in the
rural south of Alberta, they now are distributed more than 50 per cent in the
major centers of Edmonton, Calgary, and
Lethbridge. They have become urbanized
in approximately the same proportion as
the rest of Alberta’s population. According to the studies of Mormons conducted
in the United States (Enstrom, 1975),
Latter-day Saints are about average in socioeconomic status, as opposed to Seventh
Day Adventists and Jews who are markedly above average. This fact allows the
research to avoid the confusing effect of
higher socioeconomic status on health. In
Studies of Seventh Day Adventists and
Jews we do not know whether their better
health is due to life style related to their
religion or to the advantages of higher income, education, and occupational status.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study examines all Mormon deaths
occurring in Alberta during the years 1967
through 1975. They were located by examination of annual reports of all Mormon
ecclesiastical units in the province of Alberta. Names and identifying information
such as date and place of death were then
linked with vital statistics records in Alberta. The number of deaths which occurred during this period was 1,169, of
which all but 4.2 per cent could be linked
with official death certificates so as to obtain the cause of death. For calculations of
rates, the base population was reduced
proportionately by the proportion that
could not be linked. Of the 49 deaths that
could not be linked, 26 are known to have
occurred outside the province. Provincial
reporting of cause of death is understandably less likely if the death occurred
out of the province, although some deaths
are reported from other jurisdictions.

A particular advantage of this study is
that the census of Canada includes religious membership. Thus, one can compute an accurate age and sex composition
of the Latter-day Saint population in Alberta. The 1971 reported population of
Mormons from Latter-day Saint records is
slightly smaller (29,356) than the census
Latter-day Saint population (31,085). The
difference can be explained in two ways.
First, the Latter-day Saint category as
compiled by the census of Canada includes
certain separate smaller sects not organizationally under the direction of Salt Lake
City but historically related to the origins
of Mormonism. They do not follow exactly
the same dietary rules as the larger church
nor do they live precisely the same life
style in other ways. In Alberta they constitute a very small proportion of the total
Latter-day Saint group, but they could account for the difference between reported
and census Mormon populations. Their
inclusion should not create substantial
proportional shifts in the age and sex
structure of the population. Second, in any
given year there may have been a small
proportion of Latter-day Saint units which
did not report either population or death
totals. For these two reasons, the smaller
reported population was used, which
necessitated a proportional reduction of
census sex and age categories to conform
to the reported total Mormon population.
There may also have been a few individuals who are not listed on church records
but who respond in the census that they
are Latter-day Saints. As their names are
not recorded as church members, their
deaths will also not be recorded.

RESULTS

The results of the analysis are presented
in two tables. In Table 1 crude death rates

berta, and the Latter-day Saints (in Alberta) per 100,000 population. Because
the Mormon birth rate is higher than that
for the rest of the population, with corresponding alterations in the age structure,
indirect standardization was performed on
the Alberta population so as to generate
age-standardized mortality ratios for the
major causes of death for the Latter-day
Saint population. Many diseases are selective by age, as is death in general. As
there are major differences between the
age structures of the Alberta and the
Mormon population, the crude death rates
are biased by age-structure differences,
and standardization is necessary.

Some categories of death include very
small numbers of Latter-day Saint deaths.
For this reason, chance fluctuations may
have affected the results. Although statistical significance was calculated, the small
numbers also make statistical significance
difficult to attain. Therefore, special attention should be given to the general pattern of results.

Canadian crude death rates are higher
than Alberta rates for almost all causes of
death reported here except for cancer of
the prostate, endocrine and metabolic diseases, diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissues, causes of
perinatal mortality and morbidity, accidental deaths and suicides for men; and
cancer of the rectum, diseases of the nervous system and sense organs, perinatal
mortality, and accidents for women. Most
of the results hold up when the rates are
standardized (see Table 2).! The differences are largely unexplained and reflect
the generally more favorable pattern of

1 In Table 2 are found standardized mortality rates
for various causes of death. If the ratio is 1.00, then
the observed deaths among Mormons are exactly the
same as would be expected when age-specific rates of
death from a particular disease are applied to the
Mormon age distribution. The ratio indicates the
proportional under- or overrepresentation of deaths
from a specific cause among Mormons.

mortality and longer life expectancy in the
prairie provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba. These provinces, in
that order, have lower rates of death from
the major killer diseases and longer life
expectancies than the other provinces. It is
important to show these differences in
order to understand that the Alberta population, from which the Mormons in our
study have been selected, is a low-risk
population compared to the country as a
whole. Further comparisons should be be

tween the Latter-day Saints and the Alberta population from which they are
drawn.

The contrast between Mormon death
rates and those for the Alberta population
is even more striking than the difference
between Canadians and Albertans. Rates
of death from cancer of all sites except
leukemia are drastically lower for Mormon men. Even cancer of the prostate,
which Enstrom (1975) found to be higher
than average for Mormon men, was lower

than average for Alberta Mormons. Although Mormon men contrast more sharply with the balance of Alberta men than
do Mormon women, Mormon females also
have lower rates of cancer death for all
sites than other women in Alberta. Mormon standardized mortality ratios are low
for all cancers except leukemia among
men, following the pattern for crude death
rates. Deaths from all cancers are only 64
per cent of the expected number for
Latter-day Saint men and 78 per cent of
expected deaths for Mormon women. Not
all of these sites of cancer are identified

with the effects of tobacco and alcohol.
The low rates of death from cancer at
these other sites suggest the need for further investigation of the effects of Mormon
life style on health.

Mormons also enjoy a preferential risk
position with regard to diseases of the circulatory system. Latter-day Saint men and
women do not die as often from these diseases, although again Mormon males are
more different from other Albertans than
are Mormon women. Mormon women
have lower rates of death from circulatory
disease than Mormon men, but the differ

ence in favor of Mormon women ts much
less than that for the Alberta population as
a whole.

Among specific circulatory diseases, the
most notable difference may be in the leading cause of death, ischaemic heart disease. Mormon crude rates for both men
and women are just over half the Alberta
rates. When age structure is taken into
account, Mormon men have 62 per cent
the risk of death in any given year from
ischaemic heart disease, and Mormon
women die 71 per cent as often as Alberta
women of the same age. When one reflects
that the Alberta population has substantially lower rates of death from ischaemic
heart disease than the rest of Canada,
these findings are all the more remarkable.

Crude death rates for cerebrovascular
disease are lower for Latter-day Saints
than for other Albertans, although when
standardized, rates for Mormon women
are about average. Mormon males die of
strokes only 71 per cent as often as do
other males in Alberta. Results for other
forms of circulatory diseases are more
equivocal.

Respiratory diseases such as emphysema, bronchitis, asthma, and to a lesser
extent, pneumonia and influenza should
be less frequent among a population that
smokes less than average. Although crude
death rates for respiratory diseases for
Mormon males are substantially lower
than Alberta rates, they are only slightly
lower than average for Mormon females.
Standardized ratios operate to decrease
the Mormon advantage in this regard.
Mormon males die of respiratory diseases
73 per cent as often as expected, and female Mormons actually have a slightly
greater than average risk. Among specific
ailments in this category, Latter-day
Saints enjoy the greatest protection from
bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Males
(SMR = 0.63) show a greater deficit of
deaths than do females (SMR = 0.84),

Mormon Mortality Rates

299

probably related to their greater propensity for smoking and their longer smoking
histories.

Diseases of the digestive system are also
slightly underrepresented among Mormons. One such disease, cirrhosis of the
liver, is quite rare among Mormons. Only
44 per cent as many Mormon males as
would be expected died of this disease,
and no Mormon females died of cirrhosis
during the nine years of the study. It is
well known that cirrhosis of the liver is
closely related to heavy alcohol consumption.

Mormons also fall prey less often than
others to endocrine and metabolic diseases
(male SMR = 0.78; female SMR = 0.87),
such as diabetes mellitus, which is not
likely to be due to not smoking but is
probably due to some other life-style factor
such as drinking or diet.

Other causes of death present patterns
not so clearly in favor of Mormons. It can
be argued that all persons must die of
some cause. If a group avoids some of the
causes of death that kill in early life or in
middle age, then sooner or later its members must die of other causes, which may
explain in part the propensity of Mormon
males (SMR = 1.63) to die of genitourinary diseases such as hyperplasia of the
prostate. Female Latter-day Saints are not
similarly afflicted, indicating a lower than
average (SMR = 0.54) risk of dying of
genitourinary diseases.

Mormons have somewhat greater than
average risks of death from infective and
parasitic diseases and musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases. The
causes for these higher risks are not
known, although the numbers involved
are small; and as with all of the minor
causes of death, chance variation may be a
factor. Diseases of the nervous system and
sense organs show slightly greater than
average risks for Mormon males but low
rates of death for women.

Deaths among infants present an unusual picture. Mormons have a substantially higher than average birth rate.
Moreover, Mormon women continue to
have children longer than other women.
Although these factors may contribute to a
lower incidence of breast cancer, they may
increase the chances of birth defects for
Mormon children. Assuming a proportionate number of these are fatal birth defects, Mormons should have a greater than
expected number of deaths due to congenital anomalies. The findings do not provide
clear support for this hypothesis. Deaths
due to congenital anomalies are more frequent than average for Mormon females
(SMR = 1.51), but less frequent for Mormon males (SMR = 0.53). For both sexes
combined, the rate of death due to congenital anomalies is about average. For
other causes of perinatal morbidity and
mortality, such as birth injury and various
anoxic and hypoxic conditions, Mormon
infants of both sexes are substantially protected from fatality. All causes of death
considered, the fatal-risk position of
Latter-day Saint infants is as good as
average and probably better, a fact which
runs counter to the hypothesis indicated
by the fertility patterns of the group.

Accidental and other violent deaths are
the principal cause of death for children
and young adults in Canada. One would
expect Mormons to have lower rates of
death from these causes if only for the
reason that many of them abstain from
alcohol. Alcohol is well known as a contributory factor in many accidental
deaths. In this case, however, the findings
are contrary to expectation. Mormon
males were killed in motor vehicle accidents at approximately the same rate as
other Alberta males. Mormon females
died in such accidents at higher than average rates (SMR = 1.33), although this result is not statistically significant at the
0.05 level. However, the rates may be

Jarvis

Social Biology

even higher than reported here. Mormon
records indicate that a substantial proportion of untraceable and out-of-province
deaths occur as the result of motor vehicle
accidents. The reason for these unexpectedly high rates is not known. Although
further research would be necessary to
move beyond conjecture, it is possible that
Mormons drive automobiles more than
others. The extensive commitment to
meetings during the week, several times
on Sunday, trips to the temple on a regular
basis, and rather frequent trips to Salt
Lake City for conferences and other reasons would all subject the Latter-day Saint
population to increased risk, especially as
these trips are made at all times of the
year. When accidents other than motor
vehicle accidents are considered, the high
rates are somewhat reduced.

Mormon males have a lower than average risk of committing suicide (SMR =
0.72), but the same is not true for Latterday Saint females (SMR = 1.07). As in
many other causes of death, the mortality
advantage experienced by Mormon males
is greater than that enjoyed by Mormon
females. The finding is reminiscent of the
work of Gove (1972) who found that men
benefit more than women from the preferential mortality risks associated with being
married. These results suggest that with
higher mortality and greater numbers of
preventable deaths, males are more likely
to benefit from any environmental or social condition which improves mortality in
general.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Mormon cause-specific mortality rates
were calculated and standardized by age
for both males and females by compiling
lists of Mormon deaths from Latter-day
Saint church records and linking them
with province of Alberta death certificates
to obtain the official cause of death. A

greater proportion of deaths was traceable
than in previous studies. The research was
also aided by the availability of census
information on religion which permitted
the computation of a relatively accurate
sex and age distribution of the Alberta
Mormon population. Cause-specific death
rates for Mormons in Alberta were compared to those for the general population
of Alberta and of all Canada.

In general, the findings were as follows:

1. Mormon death rates for most causes
are lower than those for Alberta,
even though the Alberta rates are
lower than those for all Canada.

2. Mormon death rates for males are
higher than those for females for
most Causes.

3. Male and female death rates are
more similar among Mormons than
among the general population.

4. Causes of death for which Mormons
have an average or higher than average risk are either less frequent
causes of death or are less clearly
related to dietary habits of Mormons.

5. Mormons have disproportionately
low rates of death for many causes of
death which are not clearly related to
the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, or
tea.

These findings suggest the need for further research on what actually constitutes
the life style of Mormons, as well as what
the specific effects of different life-style
components are. For instance, more research is needed to ascertain the effects of
the use of meat, coffee, tea, and other
dietary elements as well as the possible
effects of athletic fitness programs, family
solidarity, extensive social participation,

amine health and mortality of Mormons at
various church-activity or participation
levels rather than in gross mixed populations as have all Mormon studies to this
date.

A possible explanation of decreased
Mormon mortality risks lies in the biological selectivity of the group. Many Mormons in Alberta are related to each other,
claiming descent from the small number of
families that colonized southern Alberta
over eighty years ago. It is conceivable
that these families were markedly healthy
and that modern Mormons have only inherited those characteristics. The biological explanation must contend with the
fact, however, that a substantial but unknown proportion of Mormons in Alberta
have migrated from elsewhere or have
joined the church as converts through
missionary activity. In the future, studies
need to relate Mormon health and mortality to the years of exposure to Mormon life
style. For example, it would be interesting
to compare the mortality of converts to
those who are descended from early Mormon families.

The above considerations aside, the
findings of this research strongly indicate
the possibility of saving a great many lives
from cancer, heart disease, respiratory
diseases, and other illnesses by alteration
in life style. Such alteration could be
begun by a combination of childhood education discouraging the use of alcohol and
tobacco and by changes in the advertising
of such commodities. Moreover, social
structural changes may be required in
order to alter the social meanings of contexts in which such commodities are regularly used.
