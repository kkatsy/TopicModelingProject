The Estimation of Natural Fertility:
A Micro Approach

ABSTRACT: The estimation of natural fertility has heretofore been confined to population aggregates. This paper presents a technique for estimating natural fertility at the household level for
developing countries with some practice of deliberate family size limitation and applies it to
micro-level WFS data for Sri Lanka and Colombia for females aged 35—44 in intact marriages.
The technique is based on a proximate determinants equation estimated as part of a model that
takes account of the interdependence between use of fertility control and natural fertility. To
evaluate the results, the mean and household level estimates of natural fertility for each country
are first compared with actual fertility; then mean estimates for each country are compared
with macro-level estimates of natural fertility based on three other methods. Finally, the implications of the analysis for the proximate sources of intercountry and intracountry variations in
natural fertility are examined. The results suggest that the present approach yields plausible
quantitative estimates of natural fertility and reasonable analytical results.

Although the concept of natural fer- _ tions of the analysis for the proximate
tility has gained growing acceptance _ sources ofintercountry and intracountry
(Henry, 1953; Leridon, 1977; Leridon variations in natural fertility are examand Menken, 1979), its empirical esti- _ ined.

fertility in that it refers to the fertility a
population would have experienced in
the absence of a family planning program; in consequence it tends to be
lower than natural fertility and may be
confined to program clientele alone
rather than the general population
(Bongaarts, 1982).
The estimation here of natural fertility, defined as fertility in the absence of
family planning practices, whether or
= — not those practices are due to a family
“ planning program, is based on a model
é 8 of fertility determination (see Appendix

— A). The model starts with a fertility
® equation in which the number of chil6 dren ever born per woman is expressed
S as a function of various ‘“‘proximate de
>. terminants,” whose selection is gov
“= emed primarily by the nature of the

‘S duration of marriage, including consen‘S sual unions; first and second birth inter= vals; secondary sterility (NSS); length of

Sone would expect that the cumulative
3 fertility of a continuously married
s% woman near the end of her reproductive

—

wnload

& (1) ifthere is no use of fertility control by
her or her husband;

(2) the longer her period of exposure, as
measured by duration of marriage;

(3) the more rapid her early rate of childbearing, as measured by first and second birth intervals;

(4) the shorter her period of secondary
sterility;

(5) the shorter her duration of breastfeeding and consequent lactational
amenorrhea;

(6) the lower her rate of fetal wastage
(miscarriages, spontaneous abortions, and stillbirths), and hence

physiological problems of reproduction;

(7) the higher the couple’s rate of child
mortality and consequent shortening
of the nonsusceptible period.

In terms of Bongaarts’ (1980) proximate
determinants classification, the contraceptive use variable can be thought of as
an approximate measure of deliberate
fertility control. The other variables
comprise collectively a set of natural fertility determinants with duration of marriage reflecting the extent of exposure to
intercourse; first birth interval, fecundability; pregnancy wastage, spontaneous
intrauterine mortality; ““NSS,” secondary sterility; and the combination of second birth interval, breastfeeding in the
last closed interval, and child mortality,
the duration of postpartum infecundability.

One might simply fit Equation (1) to
the data and use the resulting regression
coefficients to estimate natural fertility,
setting the use variable equal to zero, as
we have in fact done previously (Easterlin and Crimmins, 1982). An objection to this procedure is that the contraceptive use vartable in Equation (1) is
itself partly dependent on a household’s
natural fertility. For example, as between two households that are in other
respects the same, the one with higher
natural fertility has a greater prospect of
unwanted children and hence will be under greater pressure to adopt deliberate
control. Equation (2a) specifies the relationship between use and natural fertility, based on the synthesis framework of
fertility determination (Easterlin, Pollak, and Wachter, 1980). There are
three new variables in this equation: (1)
potential family size, the natural fertility
of a couple adjusted for child mortality
(Cn); (2) desired family size (Cd); and
(3) the costs of fertility control (RC),

which is approximated here, quite inadequately, by the number of fertility
control methods known by a respondent. In general, use of fertility control
is more likely, the greater the prospect
that unregulated fertility will lead to a
family size considerably in excess of that
desired (that is, the greater the excess of
Cn over Cd), and the lower the costs of
fertility regulation (RC).

A two-stage procedure is used to estimate the resulting simultaneous equation model. First, the reduced form
Equation (2b), in which contraceptive
use appears as a function only of exogenous variables, is estimated by logit and
used to construct an instrumental variable, predicted probability of use. This
instrumental variable is then used along
with the natural fertility determinants to
estimate the coefficients of Equation
(1), which, in turn, provide the basis for
household level estimates of natural fertility.

This model was arrived at after considerable experimentation—with other
proximate determinants (e.g., frequency of intercourse, age at marriage,
classification of method used by efficiency), nonlinear formulations, and
alternative estimation procedures.

RESULTS

The estimated fertility equation,
Equation (1), is presented in Table 1. In
both countries, the expected directions
of relationships hold, and all of the coefficients except one are significant. Note,
for example, that fertility varies inversely with such proximate determinants as use of fertility control and
length of breastfeeding, and directly
with duration of marriage and fecundity
(NSS). The coefficients on use imply
that, on the average, slightly over three

 

Social Biology

births are averted by users of fertility
control.

The high mean values for the first and
second birth intervals in Table 1 result
from the values assumed for these variables for women with no child or only one
(see Appendix B). For women with at
least two births, first and second birth intervals were, respectively, 21.4 and 29.2
months in Sri Lanka and 16.6 and 23.7
months in Colombia (Easterlin and
Crimmins, 1982, p. 11). (These figures
also exclude women with premarital
births or who used fertility control prior
to the second birth.)

To estimate a household’s natural
fertility, its values on the X, through X7
variables of Equation (1) are multiplied
by the corresponding coefficients and
the resulting products summed. Thus, a
household’s estimated natural fertility
will be higher, the longer its duration of
marriage, the shorter its first and second
birth intervals, the shorter its duration
of breastfeeding, and so on. In Sri
Lanka the mean value of natural fertility
yielded by this procedure is 6.8 births;
this compares with an average actual
fertility of 5.2 (Table 2, Line 1). The implied average number of births averted
through deliberate fertility control is
1.6. For Colombia the mean values are
somewhat higher: natural fertility, 8.2;
actual fertility, 6.2; births averted, 2.0.
At the household level, estimated natural fertility in Sri Lanka ranges between
values of —1 and 12, with over eighttenths of the population falling between
values of 5 and 10 (Table 2, Col. 1). In
Colombia the range is from —2 to 13
with over three-fourths of the population between 7 and 12 (Table 2, Col. 4).
Negative estimates of natural fertility
are, of course, implausible. Fortunately, almost all of the negative estimates are only —1, and the percentage

of the total that is negative is very low—
1.6 in Sri Lanka, 3.2 in Colombia.

In comparison with the distribution
of actual fertility, that of natural fertility
is somewhat more concentrated (Table
2, Cols..1, 2, 4, and 5). Although the
mean of natural fertility is higher than
that of actual fertility, both the highest

and lowest values of natural fertility are
lower than those of actual fertility. This
implies that there are more households
whose actual fertility exceeds their estimated natural fertility than is suggested
by the negative estimates of natural fertility in Columns 1 and 4. Differencing
natural and actual fertility, one finds

that in Sri Lanka about 13 per cent of the
households are in the implausible situation of actual fertility greater than natural fertility; in Colombia, about 17 per
cent (Table 2, Col. 3 and 6). Put positively, this means that estimated natural
fertility equals or exceeds actual fertility
in the great bulk of the cases—over
eight-tenths of the households in both
countries.

The comparison just given of the
household level natural fertility estimates with actual fertility provides one
test of the natural fertility estimates.
Another test is to compare the average
level of natural fertility obtained from
the micro-level approach with that
yielded by macro-level estimating procedures adapted to estimate cohort natural fertility for the actual duration of

marriage. The details of the macro-level
procedures are given in Appendix C.
One, developed by Srinivasan and Jejeebhoy (1981), is based on the CoaleTrussell (1974) model of fertility. The
other two are suggested by Bongaarts’
work (1978, 1980). The Bongaarts ‘‘C;”
method adjusts downward an assumed
total fecundity rate of 15.3 births for
length of exposure, prevalence of sterility, and duration of breastfeeding; the
Bongaarts “C,”’ method adjusts upward
observed age-specific fertility to allow
for contraceptive use and effectiveness.

Table 3 shows that for both Sri Lanka
and Colombia the mean value of the
micro-level estimate of natural fertility
is of the same order of magnitude as that
obtained by the other methods. For Sn
Lanka, however, the micro-level esti

mate is higher than the alternative estimates, whereas for Colombia it falls
within the range of the alternatives. One
hint that the Sri Lanka micro-level estimate is on the high side is that the Sri
Lanka coefficient on the fertility control
variable, U, in Table 1 implies almost
the same number of births averted by
contraceptive use as in Colombia, despite the fact that the length of use in Sri
Lanka is only about six-tenths that in
Colombia (Easterlin and Crimmins,
1982, p. 11).

One final test can be made of the
micro-level approach—in terms of the
plausibility of its analytical implications.
Bongaarts (1983, p. 26) has analyzed the
contribution of various proximate determinants to variations among countries
in natural marital fertility and concluded
that “‘variations in the duration of postpartum amenorrhea are the main cause
of variations in levels of natural marital
fertility among different populations.”
Although our set of proximate determinants is imperfect, the present approach
can be used to explore the sources of
natural fertility variations both among
and within countries. As has been seen,
the mean level of natural fertility is
higher in Colombia than Sri Lanka. To
identify the reasons for this in terms of
the present set of proximate determinants the following procedure is used.

 

Natural Fertility

165

For each of the natural fertility determinants X, through X7 the excess of Colombia’s mean value over that of Sri
Lanka’s, as derived from Column 3 of
Table 1, is multiplied by the average of
the two countries’ corresponding regression coefficients in Column 1. This calculation yields the following contribution in number of births of each
proximate determinant to Colombia’s
higher natural fertility:

Second birthinterval ...... +0.18

Duration of breastfeeding,

last interval ..........0005 + 0.26
Pregnancy wastage ........ 0
Infant and child mortality .. +0.03
Total .cscvveossesannasee +0.90

The total of all contributions, 0.90,
compares with a difference in natural
fertility between the two countries of
1.43 shown in Table 2. The discrepancy
is due to differences between the countries in the regression coefficients in Table 1. Examination of the contributions
of the individual proximate determinants shows that differences between
the countries in the proximate determinants related to postpartum amenorthea (second birth interval, duration of
breastfeeding, and child mortality) account for about half of Colombia’s
higher natural fertility. The somewhat
smaller role of postpartum amenorrhea
here than in Bongaarts’ analysis may be
due to deficiencies in the measurement
of this magnitude. The other important
proximate determinants accounting for
the natural fertility difference are the
secondary sterility variable (NSS) and
first birth interval. Repetition of the
above analysis for females with two or
more children reduces considerably the
contribution of first birth interval. This
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

166

suggests that in the present results for all
females, first birth interval is primarily
capturing a sterility effect due to the
long first birth intervals assumed for
childless women (Appendix B).

One would suppose that the importance of sterility factors vis-a-vis postpartum amenorrhea would be more important in affecting natural fertility
variations within populations than
among populations, and the present natural fertility estimates give some hint of
this. The simple correlations within each
country of estimated natural fertility
with each of the proximate determinants
look as follows (an asterisk indicates not
significant at the 0.05 level):

Sri
Lanka Colombia
Duration of marriage 0.53 0.66
First birth interval —-0.49 -0.41
Second birthinterval -0.43 —0.36
Not secondary sterile 0.54 0.48
Duration of
breastfeeding;
last closed interval -—0.03* —0.04*

Pregnancy wastage —0.30 -0.10
Infant and child mor
tality 0.15 0.19

Note the sizeable coefficients for NSS
and first birth interval compared with
those for the three variables related to
postpartum amenorrhea—second birth
interval, infant and child mortality, and
duration of breastfeeding. (As in the intercountry comparison, first birth interval here largely reflects sterility. The
correlation coefficient drops sharply
when the population is confined to those
with two or more children.) Indeed, the

Crimmins and Easterlin

 

Social Biology

simple correlation on the breastfeeding
variable is not significant, perhaps indicating that the last closed interval is a
poor indicator of a woman’s typical
breastfeeding behavior. Note also the
sizeable positive correlation between estimated natural fertility and duration of
marriage, which again seems reasonable.

In summary, our general impression _
is that the micro-level approach to estimating natural fertility presented here
yields, for the most part, plausible quantitative estimates of natural fertility and
reasonable analytical results.

METHODOLOGY FOR MACRO-LEVEL
ESTIMATES

All of the methods described below
have been adapted to provide cohort
rather than period estimates of natural
fertility, and are estimated for the observed mean duration of marriage rather
than for a hypothetical marriage period
such as age 15 to 45. The first method was
used by Srinivasan and Jejeebhoy (1981)
to compare natural fertility among Indian
states and by Jejeebhoy (1979) to examine the trend in natural fertility over time
in Taiwan. It is based on the Coale and
Trussell (1974) formula,

r(aj=n(a)* Me e@
where,.

r(a) is the age-specific marital fertility
rate at age a;

n(a) is the natural fertility rate at age a,
from the standard schedule;

M _ isthescaling factor of natural fertility;

m is the factor representing the relative use of fertility regulation at age
a; and

v(a) is the standard schedule by which
the age-specific marital fertility
rate is reduced because of regulation.

Setting 7 =0, this reduces to

r(a)=n(a)*M

It is possible to estimate M from the observed age-specific marital fertility schedule, using the procedures of Coale and
Trussell. Applying this to the n(a) values
suggested by Coale and Trussell (1975, p.
572), one obtains estimates of r(a), the
natural fertility schedule applicable to the
population being studied.

The other two methods are derived
from the work of Bongaarts (1978, 1980).
The first method is based on Bongaarts’
formula,

TNM=TF « C,,
where

TNM is the total natural marital fertility
rate,

TF isthe total fecundity rate, and

C; _ is the index of lactational infecundability,

except that TNM and TF are estimated
here for the observed mean duration of
marriage (Bongaarts, 1978, p. 122).

The calculation of TF follows the ‘‘direct estimate’”’ procedure described by
Bongaarts (1978, p. 118). Potential reproductive years were converted to actual reproductive years by adjusting for
the proportion fecund at each age as estimated from the Pittenger sterility formula (Trussell, p. 57). The latter was

then converted to an estimate of the total
fecundity rate by dividing by 20 months
(1.667 years), Bongaarts’ estimate of the
typical mean interval in the absence of
lactation.

The index of lactational infecundability, C;, is based on Bongaarts’ formula,

20
18.5 +1

where / is the mean duration of postpartum infecundability (in months) (Bongaarts, 1980, p. 26). The latter was estimated from the median duration of
breastfeeding using the model relationship between lactation and infecundability from a study by Lesthaege and Page
(1980, p. 27). The average median from
current status breastfeeding data as well
as data from the last closed birth interval
were used as input to the model. Before
averaging, both distributions were
smoothed in order to produce medians
corrected for response heaping. This
smoothing was done using the technique
demonstrated by Lesthaege and Page
(1980) on the closed interval data and a
nine-month moving average on the current status data.

The second method derived from
Bongaarts’ work is based on the formula

TNM = TMI(C.« C,),

C; =

where

TNM is the total natural marital fertility
rate,

TM isthe total marital fertility rate,

C, is the index of noncontraception,
and

C, 1s the index of induced abortion.

TNM is estimated for the observed duration of marriage (Bongaarts, 1980, p. 23).
To do this the calculation is performed
for each group and the resulting values
are summed across age groups.

To the cohort age-specific marital fertility rates the index of noncontraception

Natural Fertility

C.is applied. This index is defined as
C,= 1-1.1leeeu

where e is the average use effectiveness
and u is the prevalence of contraceptive
use among married women. Because
complete cohort contraceptive histories
were unavailable, the age specific schedules of e and u were estimated from the
distribution of age at first use of contraception and the method of contraception
first used. The distribution of age at first
use was cumulated to obtain the number
of ever-users in each age group. Age specific rates of ever-use for the cohort were
converted to current use (u) by applying
the ratio of current-use to ever-use obtained in the survey from 35—44 year olds.
Examination of this ratio for younger
women indicated it varied little by age.
To calculate average use effectiveness
(e), the distribution of women by age at
first use was cumulated for each method
of first use to construct a distribution of
women by method of use for each age
group. An average effectiveness rating
(e) was then obtained by weighting this
distribution by the method-specific effectiveness levels for developing countries
given by Bongaarts (1980, p. 25). This
procedure could underestimate effectiveness if women switch from less effective
to more effective methods as they age.
The age-specific values of C, were
then applied to the age-specific values of
Ty to adjust for contraceptive use. These
age-specific natural marital fertility rates
were then adjusted for the proportion of
the cohort that was exposed as it passed
through each age group, to obtain a duration of marriage-specific TNM. Since
very little induced abortion is reported in
Colombia and no information is gathered
on this topic for Sri Lanka, the index of
abortion, C,, is assumed to equal 1. This
procedure was followed by Bongaarts in
his own application of the method to Sri
Lanka and Colombia (Bongaarts, 1980,

p. 12).
