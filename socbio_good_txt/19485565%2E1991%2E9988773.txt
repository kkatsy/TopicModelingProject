Voluntary Childlessness
Among American Men and Women
in the Late 1980’s

ABSTRACT: Most studies of childlessness in the United States have relied on unrepresentative,
opportunistic samples collected in a variety of ways. Thus, the relationship of various correlates
to childlessness is not well known. Some studies have focused on demographic variables, but
have not examined attitudinal factors associated with childlessness—something the
opportunistic samples have been able to do. In this paper we examine both attitudinal and
demographic factors associated with childlessness in the United States. The data used in this
paper are from the National Survey of Families and Households collected in 1987 and 1988. The
data set includes both demographic data, perceived advantages and disadvantages of having
children, and attitudinal data about related social issues. Overall, the rate of voluntary
childlessness was not high. Only 3.5 per cent of the men and 2.8 per cent of the women reported
that they were childless and did not expect to have children. Only one category of people
(unmarried men and women over the age of 35) had rates that exceeded ten per cent. A
combined variable of age and marital status was the best predictor of childlessness. A scale of
reasons or justifications for having children was the next best predictor. In addition, attendance
at religious services, number of hours the respondents desired to work and education (for
women only) were related to childlessness. Those who scored highly on measures of support for
traditional families and support of extended families also tended to have lower rates of
childlessness. Occupational status, religious denomination, and race, on the other hand, were
not significantly related to childlessness. Measures of gender equality, religious
fundamentalism, and support for mothers working were also not related to childlessness.

Changes in American society have
dramatically altered the nature of family
life (Bumpass, 1990). Rising female labor force participation and growing
ideals of gender equality have challenged traditional gender roles. In addition, early initiation of sexual activity,
increased cohabitation, and delayed
marriage have further weakened the
tenuous relationship between sexual activity and marriage. Increased use of effective contraceptives has separated
sexual intercourse and childbearing.
These changes and others have resulted
in delayed childbearing, a long-term decline in fertility, and an all-time low family size.

Despite greater tolerance of alternative family forms, however, most people
in the 1980’s still expected to marry and
have children (Thornton, 1989).
Though some have expressed concern
over the falling fertility rate (e.g.,
Tietelbaum, 1985; Wattenberg, 1987),
elements of pronatalism documented by
Blake (1966) at the end of the baby
boom remain prevalent in America.

The purpose of this paper is to update
and extend our understanding of one
deviation from traditional familial
norms, namely, voluntary childlessness.
Despite predictions that a substantial
portion of American couples might opt
for childlessness (see, for example,
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

80 Jacobson and Heaton

Veevers, 1979), past research has demonstrated that relatively few people
have actually remained childless. Furthermore, the rate of childlessness has
remained relatively low (see Houseknecht, 1987; Jacobson et al., 1988), although there are some indications that it
may have risen recently (Rindfuss et al.,
1988). Thus, the changes in the demographic composition of American society, trends toward gender equality,
changing attitudes about familial issues,
and delayed childbearing may yet result
in increased rates of childlessness.

Several researchers have investigated
voluntary childlessness in America over
the past few decades, including its incidence, correlates and predictors, and its
effects. The most common articles simply describe the rate of total childlessness or demographic predictors of childlessness. Less commonly, articles focus
on “statements of motive,” or reasons
for childlessness. Examination of total
rates of childlessness, however, confounds two separate phenomena, infecundity and voluntary childlessness.
Voluntary childlessness is defined as
having no children and not expecting to
have any. In the present paper, we focus
on demographic, attitudinal, and motivational correlates of voluntary childlessness.

Few of the previous studies have relied on systematic national samples.
Most have been descriptive or exploratory and have utilized opportunistic or
purposive samples. Such studies have
examined a variety of correlates of
childlessness. Unfortunately, such studies have limited generalizeability. Both
the estimates of the rates of childlessness and the relationship of the correlates are unreliable.

A review of 47 studies of voluntary
childlessness in the United States published prior to 1986 found only five stud
Social Biology

ies based on representative samples
(Houseknecht, 1987). Of the five, four
were published in the late 1970’s; the
fifth was published in 1954. And, the
sample sizes were small since the childless constitute only a small proportion of
all married women. The five representative samples ranged in size from 18 to
119.

Roughly a dozen studies have been
published in the years since the
Houseknecht review, but the lack of
good, recent, and representative samples persists. Only four of the published
studies done recently utilized representative samples. One (Poston and Kramer, 1986) examined only Catholic and
non-Catholic differences and their data
were collected in 1976. Catholic women
were less likely to be voluntarily childless even after controlling for marital
status, religious attendance, age, and
educational attainment.

The second representative study (Jacobson et al., 1988) had a larger sample
of voluntarily childless women—363
women aged 20-44. Voluntarily childless women were those who had no children and did not expect to have any.
The data included good measures of the
demographic variables but no attitudinal questions or questions about perceived value or problems associated
with having children. Thus, comparisons about the relationship of these variables along with the demographic variables could not be made.

The third study (Heller et al., 1986)
developed social-psychological profiles
of voluntarily and involuntarily childless
individuals in the General Social Survey
in 1977 and 1978. They developed good
measures of social-psychological variables, but did not control for any demographic characteristics, and they did not
compare their sample to couples with
children. They did not make clear

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

whether their sample was composed of
women, men, or both. The respondents
were simply those who were in childless
couples. One hundred and six were voluntarily childless while 107 were nonvoluntarily childless.

The findings from this study (Heller
et al., 1986) were contrary to those that
most previous researchers, using nonrandom samples, had found. For example, the voluntarily childless were less
tolerant of deviant behaviors, less politically liberal, less liberal toward women’s
rights, and less involved with nonrelatives than the nonvoluntarily childless.
They were, however, more liberal in
their lifestyle, more confident about
earning a living, and less involved in interaction with relatives than the nonvoluntarily childless. These types of factors need to be examined further with
representative samples. In addition,
males and females need to be examined
separately and compared to individuals
with children and not just to the nonvoluntarily childless.

Finally, Rindfuss et al. (1988), utilizing various data sets primarily from the
1970’s as well as earlier data from the
Current Population Surveys, have completed a massive study of the decision to
have children. Although their model is
the most elaborate to date, including
family background, adolescent characteristics, time trends, and cross-cultural

variations, they do not examine as many ©

variables simultaneously as will be reported here. They follow a cohort of
high-school students from 1972 to 1979
and examine trends through only 1980.
We will examine the social and demographic correlates of childlessness in a
recent national sample.

In sum, earlier studies have exhibited
several basic problems. First, some have
confounded infecundity and voluntary
childlessness. Second, most samples

Voluntary Childlessness 81

have been unrepresentative and small.
Thus, predicted rates and correlates of
voluntary childlessness were not always
reliable. Thirdly, most of the data were
gathered at least fifteen years ago. Many
previous studies also lack a broad coverage of variables assessed with multivariate analysis. The relative strength of
predictor variables has not generally
been assessed. The relationship of some
variables may be negligible or even nonexistent once other correlates are controlled. Moreover, the relationships between a full range of attitudinal
variables and childlessness have not received sufficient attention.

The analysis will be done separately
for men and women. Little work has
been done with males. Only 20 of the 47
studies reviewed by Houseknecht
(1987) examined males. Some had as
few as 11 respondents. Only 3 studies
had more than 74 males, and two of
those studies were done before World
War II. When results were reported for
both sexes, some important differences
in reasons for remaining childless were
found. Females were more likely to express concern about population growth
and express doubts about ability to parent; males were more likely to admit toa
general dislike of children or talk about
the economic advantages of being childless (Houseknecht, 1987, p. 378). Moreover, Rindfuss et al. (1988) found that
economic activity and a desire for success in one’s work have different influences for men and women.

The correlates of childlessness to be
examined in the present study can be divided into three general categories: demographic variables, reasons or motives
for having (or not having) children, and
social attitudinal variables. The demographic variables included in the present
study are age and marital status, occupational status, education, religious deDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

82 Jacobson and Heaton

nomination, attendance at religious
services, race or ethnicity, and number
of hours respondents prefer to work.

Age has been shown to be related to
childlessness since older women who are
still childless become involved in other
activities such as careers. Furthermore,
they come to realize that the opportunities for children are decreasing. Decisions to delay fertility are often modified
and couples may decide to remain childless (Rindfuss et al., 1988). Marriage is
still associated with childbearing for
most people and thus single individuals
are more likely to indicate that they expect to remain childless.

Childless men and women in the past
have typically been those of high occupational and educational status. Commitments in these endeavors seem to
preclude large family size and often
result in delayed childbirth. The result is
significantly higher rates of childlessness
among these groups. A desire for
fulltime employment (hours worked)
also reflects career commitment and is
expected to be associated with higher
rates of childlessness.

Cultural norms of ethnic and religious subgroups may also influence
childbearing. Those who are religiously
affiliated and attend church frequently
are more likely to be in the mainstream
of American society and thus are less
likely to remain childless. Pro-natalist
norms among Catholics have resulted,
until recently, in higher rates of childbearing among them than among Protestants. Blacks tend to marry younger
than whites, have first intercourse at a
younger age, and are more likely to
have children out of wedlock. For these
reasons, researchers have tended to find
lower rates of childlessness among
blacks than whites. Previous research
has shown these variables to be related

 

 

Social Biology

to childlessness (for reviews of this literature, see Houseknecht, 1987; Jacobson
et al., 1988).

Most social scientists assume that behavior is the product of social structure,
and also motivation. Thus, many researchers have examined reasons or
“statements of motive” individuals give
for having children or remaining childless. The respondents in the current data
were asked about a series of reasons for
having children. “Reasons” that were
related to childlessness included: “my
age,” “having someone to love,” “uncertainty about my ability to support a
child,” “‘the stress and worry of raising
children,” “having time for leisure and
social activities,” and “having time and
energy for my career.’” Houseknecht
(1987), in her comprehensive review of
articles on voluntary childlessness,
found 29 studies that had examined rationales for not having children.
Twenty-three of them had found freedom from childcare responsibility or
greater opportunity to be related to
childlessness, Sixteen had found female
career considerations and monetary advantages to be related to childlessness.
Only nine had found early socialization
experiences or doubts about ability to
parent related to childlessness. Though
not all of the studies examined all the rationales or reasons we have included,
most of the reasons have been at least
mentioned in the literature.

Given the current changes in gender
equality and family composition in
American society, we would expect several attitudinal variables to be related to
childlessness. The attitudinal variables
included in the analysis are: gender
equality, attitudes about premarital sex,
support for mothers working, belief in
traditional family arrangements, belief
that extended families should support

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 38, No. 1~2

each other, and religious fundamentalism. In essence, we would expect those
who score high on support of the first
three attitudinal scales to have higher
rates of childlessness than others. Belief
in traditional family arrangements, belief in extended families, and religious
fundamentalism would all be expected
to be negatively related to childlessness.
They all reflect traditional opinions and
would be supportive of the norm of having children. Since being childless is not
normative in society, we would expect
those scoring high on these last three
scales tc have lower rates of childlessness.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data are drawn from the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH). The survey consisted of
interviews with a national probability
sample of 13,017 respondents 19 years
of age and older. A main interview conducted by the interviewers was supplemented by several self-administered
questionnaires. Most of the basic demographic information was obtained in the
interview portion (for more details of
the survey, see Sweet et al., 1988).

By standard definitions, the childless
are those who have no children and report not intending to have any. The
scale measuring reasons for having children was not given to all respondents.
Only females age 39 or younger and
males who were married or cohabitating
with a woman age 39 or younger were
asked to fill out the questionnaire that
asked about reasons for having children.
Males 45 or younger who were not married or cohabitating were also included.
A separate category was created for
those older respondents selected out by

Voluntary Childlessness 83

age, and they are listed as “not ascertained” in the tables.

The attitudinal measures were also
obtained from the supplemental questionnaires. The items for several different scales were intermixed. The items
had a Likert-type format to which the
respondents could: strongly agree,
agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree. The items
selected for each scale were factor analyzed separately. Factor loadings for
each of the scales were generally of simiJar magnitude and all were larger than
0.4.

The demographic variables and the
reasons-for-children variable were regressed against the childless variable using multiple classification analysis. The
attitudinal variables were included as
covariates. Multiple classification analysis evaluates whether the predictor variables distinguish between the childless
and the childed. The procedure is similar to regression analysis in that multiple
variables can be assessed and effects
controlled for all other independent variables simultaneously. The independent
variables are not required to be interval
level, however, and the rate of childlessness in each discrete category of the predictor variables can be ascertained.

MEASUREMENT OF VARIABLES

Education was measured as the number of years completed, but grouped as
less than high-school graduation, highschool graduate, some college, college
graduate, and more than college graduate. Race was grouped as black, white
non-Hispanic, and other. Occupation
was grouped as professional, managerial, sales and clerical, crafts, operations
and service and labor, and not employed. The responses to the hours preferred to work variable were grouped as

84 Jacobson and Heaton

zero, less than 20, 20-34, 35-40, and
more than forty hours per week. Religious affiliation was grouped as Catholic, Baptist, other mainline Protestants,
fundamentalists, and other. Church attendance was grouped to reflect weekly
or more frequent attendance, attendance several times a month, a few times
per year, and never.

Marital status and age were combined as follows. Those who were in a
first marriage were grouped separately
as were those who were in a second or
higher marriage. Those who were divorced, widowed, or separated were
grouped together. The never-married
were then separated by age: 18-24, 2534, and 35 or older.

The scale measuring reasons for having children asked respondents (on a

_ scale of 1 to 7) “how important you feel

each (consideration) is to you at present
time.” As indicated earlier, the important considerations were: age, uncertainty about ability to support a child,
the stress and worry of raising children,
having time for leisure or social activities, having someone to love, and having
time and energy for their careers. When
run in a separate analysis, however,
some items did not scale in the expected
direction. If the respondents thought
age, stress, having leisure time, and time
for career were important, they were
more likely to be childless. These were
scored negatively on the reasons scale.
On the other hand, those who said ‘“‘ability to support a child” and “needing
someone to love’’ were important were
less likely to be childless. These items
were scored positively such that higher
scores indicate a more pronatal attitude
structure and low scores indicate a more
antinatal one.

The responses from three questions
were combined to obtain the measure of

 

Social Biology

support for mothers working (eigenvalue = 2.37, per cent variance = 59).
The respondents were asked if they approved or disapproved of mothers
working part-time and full-time when
the youngest child is under age 5, and
whether they approved or disapproved
of children under 3 years old being cared
for all day in a day care center.

Five items constituted the sexual liberation scale: whether they approved or
disapproved of “women having a child
without getting married,” whether or
not “it is all right for an unmarried
couple to live together even if they have
no interest in considering marriage,”
and whether or not “‘it is all right for unmarried 18-year-olds to have sexual relations if they have strong affection for
each other.” The final two items for the
scale were: “Married couples ought to
overlook isolated occasions of sexual
unfaithfulness,”’ and “It is all right for an
unmarried couple to live together as
long as they have plans to marry.” The
eigenvalue for the scale was 2.53 and the
factor accounted for 51 per cent of variance in the items.

The measure of religious fundamentalism was composed of similar Likerttype items (eigenvalue = 2.24, 75 per
cent variance). The three items were:
“The Bible is God’s word and everything happened or will happen exactly as
it says,” ‘“The Bible is the answer to all
important human problems,” and “TI regard myself as a religious fundamentalist.”

Five similar items composed the
measure of support for traditional family lifestyle (eigenvalue = 2.11, percent
variance = 42). The items were: “It is
much better for everyone if the man
earns the main living and the woman
takes care of the home and family,” “It’s
better for a person to get married than to
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

go through life being single,” “Marriage
is a lifetime relationship and should
never be ended except under extreme
circumstances,” “It’s better for a person
to have a child than to go through life
childless,’ and “Children have fewer
problems with two natural parents than
with one natural parent and one stepparent.”

An additional five items measured
support for extended family arrangements (eigenvalue = 1.96, per cent variance = 39). These items, in the same
format, were: “Parents ought to help
their children with college expenses,”
‘Parents ought to provide financial help
to their adult children when the children
are having financial difficulty,” ‘‘Children ought to let aging parents live with
them when the parents can no longer
live by themselves,” “‘Children ought to
provide financial help to aging parents
when their parents are having financial
difficulty,’ and “Parents ought to let
their adult children live with them when
the children are having problems.”

Finally, three Likert-type items were
used to measure gender equality. The
items were: “Parents should encourage
just as much independence in their
daughters as in their sons,” “In a successful marriage, the partners must have
freedom to do what they want individually,” and “If a husband and wife both
work full-time, they should share household tasks equally.” The eigenvalue was
1.49; the factor accounted for 50 per
cent of the variance in the items.

RESULTS

The percentage of respondents who
are childless for each category of the independent variables is presented in Table 1. Also, results from the multivariate
model are shown. Overall, only 3.5 per

Voluntary Childlessness 85

cent of men and 2.8 per cent of women
have never had children and say they do
not want any. Pronatalism appears to be
alive and well in American society. Nevertheless, childlessness does vary across
subgroups of the population.

MULTIPLE CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS

The MCA analysis shows a slight curvilinear effect for education for male respondents. The overall effect is not statistically significant, however. For females, education shows a direct linear
trend with childlessness. The more educated females tend to have higher rates
of childlessness. These differences are
reduced, but not eliminated, once other
characteristics are taken into account.
Higher education may provide greater
chances for socioeconomic success, but
the demands for socioeconomic
achievement may compete with family.
Higher education may also be associated with less traditional value orientations. Despite this tendency, only a
small minority of even the most educated women are childless by our definition.

Preliminary analysis (not shown) indicated that age and marital status have
an interactive influence on childlessness. Age of the respondent is important
for never-married respondents, but not
for the married population. Thus, these
two variables were combined. Married
persons are unlikely to be childless, regardless of whether they are in their first
marriage, between marriages, or in a
subsequent marriage. The young nevermarried respondents are a little more
likely to be childless than the married
groups, and childlessness increases dramatically with age. About one out of
five never-married people over age 35
are childless, and expect to remain so,
even after all other variables are taken

into account. This is by far the highest
percentage of childlessness observed in
any subcategory of the population considered in this study. The results for the
males and females were similar, though
the rates of childlessness were slightly
higher among the males than the females.

Although non-Hispanic whites are a
little more likely to be childless, ethnic
differences are relatively small and are
not statistically significant.

Surprisingly, occupational differences in childlessness are relatively
small. Professionals and managers of
both genders are a little more likely to
be childless, but the differences are neither large nor statistically significant.
Control for other variables also reduces
the magnitude of occupational differences. This was true for both males and
females. These results are somewhat
surprising since most studies have characterized both the male and female
childless as an occupational elite (see
the summary review by Houseknecht,
1987, p. 381).

People who prefer to work a great
deal (more than 40 hours per week) and
those who prefer not to work at all are
the most likely to be childless. A strong
commitment to career appears to be incompatible with family life for some
people. This effect is stronger for
women than men. Why those who do
not want to work have higher rates of
childlessness is not clear. Both work
preference and childlessness could
result from disability, depression, an unusual response pattern in the survey, or
some other factor. One possible pattern
may be that these are among the poorly
educated who also had slightly (though
not statistically significant) levels of
childlessness.

In combination, the differences for
occupation, education, and preferred

 

 

 

Social Biology

hours of work indicate that greater human Capital and a stronger career orientation may compete with family formation for some people, but the relatively
low rates of childlessness in all categories suggest that only a small minority
see work and family as mutually incompatible roles.

Those with no religious preference
are more likely to be childless, but denominational differences are not very
large, and overall this variable is not
significantly related to childlessness.
Frequency of church attendance has a
stronger relationship with childlessness
than denominational affiliation. Those
who never go to church are more likely
to be childless, and the beta coefficient
remains statistically significant once
other variables are included. Caution
must be used in attributing cause and effect, however, because many people
may attend church for the benefit of the
children they already have.

Reasons people give as important
considerations in the decision to have a
child are also correlated with childlessness for both males and females. This
variable actually increases in importance after other factors are controlled.
This relationship demonstrates the intuitive notion that people who do not have
or want children have several reasons
for their decisions. The not-ascertained
category is included here because many
respondents were not asked the reasons
questions, but we wanted to keep these
respondents in the analysis. Results for
the not-ascertained are a consequence
of the types of people who were not
asked the questions and are substantively uninteresting.

Because attitudinal variables approximate continuous variables rather than
categorical ones, they are entered as
covariates in the MCA. The factorscores are standardized such that the re

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

gression coefficient can be interpreted
as the expected increase in the per cent
childless given a change of one standard
deviation in the independent variable.
For example, men who are one standard
deviation below the mean on traditional
family values would have a rate of childlessness 5.2 percentage points lower
than men who are one standard deviation above the mean (2 X 2.606).

Correlations of factor-score variables
are generally in the expected direction.
Those who are less in favor of gender
equality, who believe in traditional family values, who oppose sexual liberalism, who believe in stronger norms of intergenerational support, and religious
fundamentalists are less likely to be
childless. But, with the exception of the
bivariate relationship for men, those
who are opposed to mothers working
also have a slight tendency toward childlessness. Only the coefficients for traditional family values and extended family
support are in the predicted direction
and statistically significant for both men
and women, however.

In combination, these variables explain 9.1 per cent of the variation in
childlessness for men, and 7.5 per cent
for women. These low values are partially due to the low overall variation in
childiessness. In other words, because
most people want or already have children, it is not easy to account for variation in this variable. The low explained
variance also points to violation of statistical assumptions when the dependent
variable is dichotomous and suggests
that other statistical approaches should
be considered.

LOG-LINEAR MODELS

In order to avoid the violation of statistical assumptions created by dichotomous dependent variables, we also conducted a log-linear analysis. Log-linear

analysis is limited, however. A large
number of categories and/or a large
number of variables results in extremely
large tables with no cases in several
cells. To minimize this problem, variables which were not found to be statistically significant in the MCA were excluded, and categories of other variables
were collapsed to show only the largest
differences. Various models were estimated to evaluate the possibility of interaction effects. A logit model was estimated with childlessness as the
dependent variable. Only interactions
statistically significant at the 0.01 level
were retained. The final model has a
likelihood ratio X? value of 531.02 with
866 degrees of freedom and a probability level of 1.00, which indicates that the
model provides a good fit of expectedto-observed frequencies of childlessness. Coefficients for this model are reported in Tables 2 and 3.

Sex or gender of the respondents did
not have a large or statistically significant (at the 0.05 level) effect in the
analysis, and so this variable was excluded. In other words, once other characteristics are taken into account, gender differences in childlessness are
minimal.

Coefficients in Table 2 show the multiplicative effect of each category of the
independent variable on the odds of being childless. For example, respondents
with less than a college degree are 0.766
times less likely than average to be childless, and those with sixteen or more
years of schooling are 1.306 times more
likely to be childless. It is often easier to
interpret the effect on the relative odds
of being childless, so the second column
reports effects on the relative odds. For
example, those with sixteen or more
years of schooling are 1.7 times more
likely to be childless than those with less
education, even though the rates of

low.

Patterns observed in Table 2 parallel
those obtained from the MCA. Those
who have never married are about 6.7
times more likely to be childless than the
ever-married population. Those who
never attend church are over twice as

' likely as church attenders to be child
less. Childlessness is also high for those
over 35, for those who prefer no work or
long work weeks, for those with antinatalist attitudes about having children,

and for those who disagree with traditional family values and norms of intergenerational support. Of these, marital status shows the greatest effect,
followed by the traditional and extended family scales. Effects of other
variables are in the 2.0 range.

matried who cannot work or who are

The second interaction indicates that
the effect of the reasons variable is accentuated in the married population.
Because interpretation of the ‘‘notascertained” category of the reasons
variable is difficult to interpret substantively, coefficients for this category are
not presented. Never-married people
may give less thought to what should be
considered before having children because childbearing is not assumed to be
an integral part of their lifestyle. On the
other hand, married persons who score
on the antinatalist end of the reasons
scale are much more inclined to be childless. They may also be rationalizing and
justifying their deviation from the norm
of having children which characterizes
the majority of the married population.

The last two interactions indicate that
the influence of the reasons variable is

contingent on traditional family values
and belief in intergenerational support.
Respondents who believe in traditional
family norms and extended family support have a strong normative framework for childbearing such that stated
reasons for childbearing have little impact on childlessness. Those who are
moderate or low on the measure of traditional values and extended family support lack normative pressures, and so
their personal preferences play a greater
role in childbearing. In other words, values supporting traditional families and
intergenerational support seem to supersede more personal reasons for having or not having children.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We defined and operationalized voluntary childlessness as not having children and expecting not to have any. By
this definition, only a small proportion
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

92 Jacobson and Heaton

of the total population is childless: 3.5
per cent of the men and 2.8 per cent of
the women. The combined variable of
age and marital status was clearly associated more closely with childlessness
than any of the other variables included
in the analysis. The second strongest
correlate of childlessness was a variable
we called reasons or motives for having
children. In general, those with an antinatalist set of reasons were more likely
to be childless. We found some significant interactions and variations from
this general pattern, however. Personal
reasons for having children had a
greater influence among the married
and those with less traditional beliefs
about family values and extended families. .

In addition to these variables, hours
of work desired and church attendance
were related to childlessness. Education
was related for women, but not for men.
Positive attitudes toward traditional
families and toward extended family
support were also related as we would
have expected.

Occupation, surprisingly, was not related to childlessness for either men or
women. Race, religious denomination,
support for gender equality, support for
women working, and religious fundamentalism were not.

Race and religious denomination
have been found by a number of previous authors to be related to childlessness. This may be changing, however.
Studies utilizing recent data have found
no differences on these two variables
(Jacobson et al., 1988). Pronatalist
norms for having children are pervasive
across racial and denominational
groups. However, religious involve
Social Biology

ment is still negatively associated with
childlessness.

Houseknecht has emphasized the necessity to examine childlessness separately for men and for women. Surprisingly, we found very little difference, by
sex, in the predicting value of the variables in our analysis. Moreover, gender
was not significant in our analysis, once
other attributes were taken into account. In general, the same variables
that showed differences for women, also
showed significant differences for men,
and those that did not predict for men
did not predict for women.

The main conclusion to be drawn
from the present study is that the norm
in American society is still to have children. Moreover, the frequency of being
childlessness in the United States is
probably not increasing dramatically.
Most people, both males and females
expect and desire to have children. Our
conclusion is in agreement with
Houseknecht (1987, p. 375) when she
states: “the long-term (her emphasis)
trend in the voluntary childless rate appears to be downward, or at least not
upward.” These statements may seem
to contradict the common notion that
childlessness is increasing, but the data
clearly show that rates of childlessness
are low. The rates of childlessness, even
in the highest subgroups rarely exceed
10 per cent. The only exception is for
men and women who have never marnied and are over age 35. Even then, the
strength of pronatalism is revealed.
Even though marriage prospects are diminishing and biological clocks are running out of time, about 80 per cent of
this group either have or still want to
have children.
