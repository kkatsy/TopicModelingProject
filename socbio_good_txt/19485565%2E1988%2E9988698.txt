Conference on Convergent Questions in Genetics and

Demography

The Population Studies Center, Departments of Biology and Economics
and Genetics Training Program at the
University of Michigan announce a conference on “Convergent Questions in
Genetics and Demography,” October
6-8, 1988 in Ann Arbor.

The conference is made possible by
funds from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The goal is to increase communication among the biological, mathematical
and social sciences in the field of population.

Sessions will consider the use of historical materials in genetics and demography; the treatment of variation and
heterogeneity in the two fields; the ge
netic component of major demographic
processes; and the interrelationship of
genetics, demography and epidemiology. Invited speakers include Elizabeth
Thompson, Massimo Livi-Bacci, James
Trussell, Warren Ewens, W.J. Schull,
Samuel Preston, Robert May, Roy Anderson and Burt Singer. An open poster
session is also planned.

To enhance discussion, attendance
will be limited to 150. For further information and registration materials please
write to Genetics/Demography Conference, Population Studies Center, University of Michigan, 1225 South University Ave., Ann Arbor, MI 48104-2590.
