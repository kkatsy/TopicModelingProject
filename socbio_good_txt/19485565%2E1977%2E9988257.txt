ABSTRACT: A multivariate model was built to investigate the effect of ethnicity on suicide in
Hawaii. To provide the model with enough flexibility, both linear and nonlinear functions were
employed. The three ethnic groups studied were Japanese, Caucasians, and Filipinos. The results
show that Japanese have the highest tendency to commit suicide while the Filipinos have the
lowest. However, the suicide rates of the three groups appear to be approaching a common value.
While age and sex proved to be highly significant in explaining suicides, the magnitude and the
form of their effect differ between one ethnic group and another. The trends of suicide rates for
each ethnic group seem to be the least uniform. Suicide rates are decreasing for Japanese males
and females and for Caucasian males. They are increasing for Caucasian females and Filipino
males, while not changing for Filipino females.

Suicide rate variations have been attributed to a large number of variables such
as age, sex, income, environment, marital
status, dependence on alcohol and drugs,
and ethnicity (Stengel, 1973). Investigating the effect of ethnicity on suicide rates
by comparing these rates among nations
has been confounded by the difference in
reporting and registration methods. In
countries where social mores strongly condemn suicide such as Ireland and Egypt,
the rates are likely to be underreported.

Since Hawaii has experienced an influx
of racially distinct groups over the last
hundred years, it provides an excellent
ground to assess the effect of ethnicity on
suicide rates and to determine whether the
disparity in these rates (if it exists) will
narrow within the boundary of a new environment. In addition, the fact that the
same registration procedures apply to all
ethnic groups would increase the reliability of reported suicides.

Kalish (1968) reported the rates of
suicide among the different ethnic groups
in Hawaii. While the other variables such

as age or sex were considered independently, their effects were not incorporated
in one model. Furthermore, appropriate
tests for statistical significance were not
provided.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the
influence of ethnicity on suicide rates using
a multivariate model that enables us to
isolate the effect of other variables that
affect suicide. The model utilizes data on
five-year intervals, beginning in 1920 and
ending in 1965, comprising a sample of
504 observations. Such a span of time is
necessary to estimate trends in suicide
rates as well as to evaluate the effect of
Hawaii’s environment on such rates
among the groups investigated.

Three racial groups were selected on the
basis of their numerical dominance in
Hawaii and certain cultural characteristics
that increase the variability of the data:
Japanese, Caucasians and Filipinos.! The

Caucasians were chosen as a reference
group because of their influence on every
aspect of Hawaii’s culture, such as the
language, the economy, the arts, etc.
Hawaiian Caucasians and mainland U.S.
Caucasians may be considered culturally
similar since the majority of Hawaiian
Caucasians originated from the mainland.
For instance, in 1970 only 34 per cent were
born in Hawaii and 3.3 per cent were
foreign-born, the rest coming from the
mainland (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1971). Japanese, especially the elderly, are
believed to commit suicide more often
than Caucasians, while Filipinos, governed by a strong Roman Catholic
influence, are expected to commit suicide
less often.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A simple regression of the suicide rate
on ethnicity is not a useful procedure for
assessing its effect. Excluding a significant
variable that is correlated with ethnicity
would cause its coefficient to be biased.
For example, if age is excluded and if
Japanese live longer than the other two
groups, the effect of their ethnicity on
suicide would be overestimated. Below is
a brief discussion of some of the variables
that affect suicide.

VARIABLES

Ethnicity.—In discussing ethnicity and
suicide some investigators attempted to
isolate the racial effect. This effort is a
hazardous task that may not lead to valuable conclusions. Stengel (1973) studied
the South African populations and was not
able to assess the effect of race on suicide
because he could not control other relevant cultural factors. Hence, most comparative suicide studies concentrate on the
cultural parameters rather than on the
narrower issue of racial differences.

were racially mixed, and this percentage is increasing
with time (State of Hawaii, 1973).

Ethnicity and Suicide in Hawaii 11

The fact that reported suicide rates vary
greatly between one country and another
is at least suggestive of real ethnic differences. Sainsbury’s (1968) findings indicated that differences in suicide rates between nations and between districts
within a nation are real and do not confirm
the view that these differences can be attributed to reporting methods. Great differences have been reported in various
parts of the world (Barrett, 1967). In 1952,
the rate was around 18/100,000 in Japan
compared to 10.8/100,000 in the United
States. In 1963, the rate was still higher in
Japan, although the gap had narrowed
somewhat (Kramer et al., 1972).

In a classic study, Guernsey (1883)
stated that in some Oriental countries
suicide was not only legal but was considered meritorious. “Hara-kiri” in Japan
was for many centuries an honored traditional form of suicide, particularly among
the nobility and military castes. Until the
practice was prohibited by law in 1868,
convicted criminals in Japan used to disembowel themselves to save family name
and property. The history of Japan is full
of famous figures who committed suicide.
Mass suicide was frequent in the caves of
Okinawa during World War II.

Western religions, on the other hand,
took a strong stand against suicide. Early
Christians thought of suicide as being a
product of “diabolical inspiration,” believing those who committed suicide died
with a mortal sin. Ultimately, canon law
decreed in the sixth century that a suicide
would not be buried on church territory,
i.e., consecrated ground. This attitude,
according to Virkkunen (1974) may have
stemmed from the belief that God has a
sovereign power over life and man cannot
therefore interfere in any way.

Porterfield (1965) maintains that religion acts as a sort of prophylactic against
suicide. He explains that it is not specific
dogma but rather the belief phenomenon
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

12 Ibrahim et al.

that guards against tendencies toward
suicidal behavior. According to Porterfield
(1965), social cohesiveness, which is strong
in Roman Catholic societies, contributes
to the fact that the suicide rate in Protestant
cantons in Switzerland is four times higher
than that in Catholic cantons. Stengel
(1973) maintained that it is religious devoutness, not specific religions, that is the
decisive factor in countries with low
suicide rates.

Age.—Age has been correlated positively with suicide. Sainsbury (1968) introduced various studies conducted by
him and by others that shed some light on
the nature of the relationship between
suicide and age. This relationship is attributed to social and biological factors. Loss
of socia] and economic status and lack of
employment were reported to have a positive effect on suicide. The author suggests
that social isolation may be the common
denominator of these variables. He adds
that social variables are related to depressive illness which in turn entails a high
risk of suicide. The risk of committing
suicide from depression is even higher
among the elderly. The term “endogenous
depression” implies that the disorder is
caused by biological factors. For the elderly, this depression would increase during the involutional period. Furthermore,
such factors as physical illness and bereavement cause a higher incidence of
suicide with age.

Kramer et al. (1972) presented data on
suicide rates in 1954-61 by age, sex, and
race in the United States. The data indicate a steady increase with age for both
males and females up to the age group
45-54, Thereafter, the rate continues to
increase for men while it starts to decrease
for women.

In highly developed countries, where
the life span on the average is long, the
suicide rate is expected to be relatively
high. Thus, the difference in the suicide

Social Biology

rates among nations, mentioned earlier,
may be partially explained by the difference in life expectancy.

The effect of age on the suicide rate may
be dependent on ethnicity. Such social factors as isolation and loss of status and
employment that contribute to suicide differ in degrees between one culture and
another. If this happens to be true with
regard to the ethnic groups investigated in
our study, breaking the-general model explaining suicide rates into different models, one for each ethnic group, may improve the results.

Sex.—Males commit suicide more often
than females. Many explanations have
been given to explain this disparity, such
as differences in male-female roles in society and longevity. Hartelius (1957) reported that the suicide rate differential between males and females is decreasing. He
attributed the decreasing disparity in
Sweden to the modernization of the female
image, i.e., urbanization, secularization,
and emancipation. Burvill (1972) also
found a recent decline in the male-female
suicide ratio. His studies of nine countries
showed that this ratio decreased between
1944-45 and 1964-65 due to the increase
in the suicide rates of females in all age
groups.

Time.—As was stated earlier, a large
number of variables may correlate with
suicide rates, such as living standard, urbanization, population, density, divorce
rates, etc. Most of these variables exhibit a
time trend; thus, including them in a time
series model such as ours creates a serious
multicollinearity problem. For this reason,
we chose to use time as a proxy. This
treatment does not account for the separate effect of each variable, but deals
with their combined effect. The procedure
is needed to avoid statistical bias in the
estimated coefficients of the variables included.

Sainsbury (1968) reported that, in gen
 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 24, No. 1

eral, female suicide rates are increasing
with time due to an increase in the rates
for elderly women while those of males are
decreasing due to a decrease in the rates
for the younger age group.

The above discussion enables us to develop the following hypotheses about these
variables which will be tested empirically:

1. Ethnicity: Suicide rates vary among
different groups. More specifically, in
Hawaii, Japanese commit suicide more
often than Caucasians who in turn commit
suicide more often than Filipinos.

2. Age: Suicide rates increase with age,
and the effect of age is dependent on
ethnicity and sex. The effect of age on the
Japanese suicide rate is greater than its
effect on the rate of the other two groups.

3. Sex: Males commit suicide more often
than females. The degree of this variable’s
dependency on ethnicity is unknown.

4. Time: Male suicide rates are decreasing with time while those of females
are increasing.

RESULTS

The estimated general equation for the
suicide rate is given below:

S = 19.93 + 0.7A ~ 21.1FE
(10.8) (—9.3)
+ 17JA ~ 1SFI — 2.2T, (1)
(6.2) (—5.3) (-2.8)

R? = 0.44, and F = 63.92, where S is the
number of suicides per 100,000, A is a
midpoint of a ten-year age class interval,
FE, JA, and FI are dummy variables?
representing females, Japanese, and
Filipinos respectively. 7 is time for fiveyear intervals and the numbers in
parentheses are Student’s t-values. “Male”
is used as a reference for the sex variable,
and “Caucasian” for ethnicity. A qua

dratic relationship in the form y =a +b, X
+ 62 X? was tried for the age and the time
variables but did not improve the model.

A glance at the ? values in Equation (1)
shows that all the variables included were
statistically significant. The signs of the
coefficients, as expected, indicate that the
suicide rate increases with age, that it is
lower for females than for males, and that
Caucasians commit suicide less often than
Japanese and more often than Filipinos.
More specifically, other variables in the
model remaining constant, Japanese on
the average commit 17 more suicides per
100,000 population than Caucasians,
while Filipinos commit 15 less. Males, on
the other hand, commit 21.1 more suicides
per 100,000 people than females. The
model also shows that the suicide rate is
decreasing with time. The reasons behind
this result are not readily apparent since
time represents the net effect of quite a few
variables.

To gain more insight into the nature of
time and other variables in the model, we
estimated separate equations for each
ethnic group investigated. In addition to
being more informative, such a treatment
should improve the model on two other
grounds. The first is that Equation (1) assumes that the influence on each variable
is independent of the other variables
while, as mentioned before, this may not
be the case. The second is that plotting age
and time on suicide rates indicates that the
form of their relationship differs with
ethnicity and sex. Thus, combining those
different groups in one model conceals
significant information. Table 1 is extremely illuminating and enables one to
draw the following conclusions:

1. A quadratic relationship between age
and suicide improved the results for each
of the ethnic groups investigated. These
results imply that suicide does not increase
with age at a constant rate. For the
Japanese, suicides increase with age at an

increasing rate while for the Caucasians
and Filipinos, it increases at a decreasing
rate as shown by Equations (3), (5), and
(7). Between the last two ethnic groups,
the rate of increase appears to decrease
with age faster for Filipinos than for
Caucasians. This finding is consistent
with prior expectations that the influence
of age on suicide is dependent on ethnicity.

2. For each ethnic group, females
commit suicide less often than males.

3. The suicide rate of Filipinos is increasing with time while those of Japanese
and of Caucasians are decreasing. A
statistical test for the difference between
two means showed that the Japanese
suicide rate is decreasing with time much
faster than Caucasian rate. This result is
rather interesting. Considering the fact
that the Filipino suicide rate is lower and
the Japanese suicide rate is higher than the
Caucasian rate, the findings suggest that
the difference in suicide rates among the
three ethnic groups will disappear in the
future.

4. Three variables, age, time, and sex,
explain 72 per cent of the variation in the
suicide rate for the Japanese, 60 per cent
for the Caucasians, and only 28 per cent
for the Filipinos.

Table 2, where suicide rates were re
gressed by ethnicity and sex, reveals further information. Firstly, age is significant
in each equation of Table 2. However, its
effect on suicide varies between one group
and another. A quadratic relationship improved the model for each group except
for Caucasian males, as shown in Equations (7), (8), (9), and (10), for example.
The results show that suicides increase
with age at an increasing rate for both
male and female Japanese (Equations [8],
[12]). For Caucasian males, the fact that
a quadratic relationship did not add more
information to a linear one suggests that
suicides increase with age at a constant
rate. For Caucasian females and male and
female Filipinos, suicides appear to increase with age at a decreasing rate
(Equations [11], [13], [14].

By maximizing the function S = 6, A +
b, A2, we can determine the peak of the
suicide rate (if it exists) for each group. For
instance, this function in Equation (13) is

0.754 — 0.00942,

and maximizing it leads to

0.75 — 0.018A = 0,

respectively

This result means that the suicide rate
for female Caucasians peaks at age 42
and is consistent with Kramer’s findings
concerning females in the United States.?
Similar derivations from Equations (14)
and (12) show that the suicide rate for
female Filipinos peaks at an earlier age (33
years) while that for female Japanese
reaches no peak, that is, it continues to
increase with age. As for males, only the
suicide rate of Filipinos reaches a peak.
Secondly, the results, except for the
Filipinos, indicate that the gap between
suicide rates of males and females is narrowing. Our findings, however, confirm
the fourth hypothesis for Caucasians only.
The gap between male and female suicides
is narrowing for the Japanese, not because
the female suicide rate is increasing but
because it is decreasing less than that of
males (Equations [8], [12]). On the other
hand, the disparity between Filipino male

derived is based on point estimation, and any reasonable confidence interval would include an age of
more than 45 years.

and female suicide rates appears to be increasing with time (Equations [11], [14]).

Thirdly, given the same ethnic group,
age and time explain a higher percentage
of the variation in suicide among males
than they do among females. These variables explain 83 per cent of the variation
in the suicide of male Japanese compared
to 65 per cent of the suicide of Japanese
females (Equations [8}, [12]}), 70 per cent of
male Caucasians to only 25 per cent of
Caucasian females (Equations [10],
[13]), and 27 per cent of Filipino males
to 10 per cent of Filipino females (Equations {11], [14]).

Other interpretations may be derived
from Table 1 and Table 2 and are left to
the interested reader.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

The patterns of suicides among
Japanese, Caucasians, and Filipinos in
Hawaii are extremely different. In general, Japanese exhibit the highest tendency
to commit suicide while Filipinos exhibit

the lowest. However, the suicide rates of
the three groups appear to be approaching
a common value. While age and sex were
demonstrated to be highly significant in
explaining suicides, the magnitude and the
form of their effects vary between one
ethnic group and another. The trends of

suicide rates seem to be least uniform. On
the average, suicide rates of Japanese
males and females and of Caucasian males
are decreasing with time. Those of
Caucasian females and Filipino males are
increasing, while that of Filipino females
is not changing.
