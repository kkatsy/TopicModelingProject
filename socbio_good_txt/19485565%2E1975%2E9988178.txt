Mormon Fertility and the Americanization

Hypothesis: Some Further Comments

A recent article in this journal by Spicer
and Gustavus (1974) pointed out and discussed the continuing high fertility of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints (Mormons). This brief report
will further develop and comment on some
of the points of the Spicer and Gustavus
paper.

In spite of the fact that the United States
census does not collect data on religion, a
variety of census and vital statistics data
from the state of Utah can serve to document the high level of Mormon fertility in
the United States relative to the national
population since over 70 per cent of Utah’s
population could be found on the church
membership rolls in 1970. As Spicer and
Gustavus pointed out, the crude birth rates
of Utah have traditionally been substantially higher than the overall U.S. rate as
far back as accurate vital statistics data for
states have been available. Utah has always
had one of the highest crude birth rates of
any state in the Union. Indeed, in the last
ten years, Utah has often been the state
with the highest crude birth rate. In 1970,
Utah had the highest fertility rate (number of children born in a year per 1,000
women aged 15-44) of any state (US.
Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare,

1974, p. 9). The 1970 census also showed
that Utah had the highest number of children ever born per 1,000 married women
of any state.

Spicer and Gustavus pointed to a series
of statements by top church leaders of the
Mormon church expressing opposition to
the use of contraception as a main factor
supporting and maintaining the high level
of Mormon fertility. While these statements
undoubtedly have influenced some Mormon
couples not to use birth control, it is questionable if Mormon theological objections
to contraception is the major factor behind
the high level of Mormon fertility. There is
substantial evidence that Mormon couples
have used contraception extensively in spite
of the opposition of church leaders. As
Spicer and Gustavus pointed out, the fact
that the crude birth rate reported by the
church has followed the same general trends
as the national rate in and of itself is strong
evidence for the extensive use of birth control by Mormon couples. A number of
studies since World War IT have indicated
that there is substantial acceptance and use
of contraception by Mormons (Christensen,
1947; Westoff and Potvin, 1967; Miller,
1972).

One of the reasons that church leaders’

282

Vol. 22, No. 3

opposition to contraception has not had
more influence on church members’ behavior is that the church has never exercised any real sanctions against members
who practiced birth control. The most obvious way to discipline church members
who used birth control would be to deny
members who do practice birth control access to Mormon temples. To enter a temple
where important religious rites, includjng
marriages are performed, Mormons must
have an interview with a local lay leader
(a “bishop”) to obtain a “recommend.” In
this interview, the bishop determines if the
person desiring to go to the temple meets
certain standards of orthodoxy and behavior (making contributions to the church,
abstaining from tobacco, alcohol, coffee,
and tea). It is church policy not to deny
temple recommends to individuals who use
birth control, and bishops are not authorized to inquire about this matter in a recommend interview.

Furthermore, the church’s statements
against birth control have been sufficiently
open-ended (“the mother’s health should
be preserved”) so that members of the
church who have practiced contraception
have been able to claim some justification
for their actions. A comprehensive historical
review of Mormon attitudes toward birth
control concluded that while church leaders
have continued to oppose birth control in
principle, the church has in practice increasingly tolerated the use of contraception
by its members (Bush, in press).

If one wishes to explain the high level of
Mormon fertility, one should not look so
much at specific teachings by church leaders
opposing contraception, as at the overall
emphasis placed on the role of marriage and
the family in Mormon culture. Mormons
believe that marriages performed in one of
their temples will endure after death. It is
considered a religious duty to marry and
‘raise an eternal family.” It is taught that

an individual’s greatest earthly and heavenly satisfactions will come from family
relationships. The socialization of Mormon
girls into wife and mother roles is explicit
and extensive.

Even though Mormons have increasingly
accepted the use of modern contraceptive
techniques, it is clear that Mormons continue to have larger families than Americans
as a whole. What of the future? Can the
Mormons be expected to maintain a higher
level of fertility than the nation as a whole?
While Mormon cultural norms emphasizing
the role of marriage and the family seem
strong and secure enough to maintain a high
level of fertility, a comparison of census
data in 1960 and 1970 on number of children ever born to women from Utah and
the general United States population provides some insight into future trends in
Mormon fertility.

Table 1 compares the number of children
ever born per 1,000 married women in

* There are almost no blacks in the Mormon Church.
Therefore, a comparison between Utah whites and whites in
the general U.S. population is the most meaningful comparison in terms of differences between Mormons and nonMormons. In 1960, however, the census did not break down
Utah fertility data for whites and non-whites. Nonetheless,
since nonwhites comprise less than 1 per cent of Utah’s
population, the 1960 comparison between U.S. whites and
the total Utah population is for all practical purposes a
comparison between whites,

various age categories for Utah whites and
whites in the overall U.S. population. Utah
women in both 1960 and 1970 had more
children than the national average in every
age category but the very youngest. However, the difference between the number of
children ever born to Utah women and
white women in general in their 20’s and
early 30’s declined sharply between 1960
and 1970. The difference between the number of children born to Utah women and
white women in general in their late 30’s
and 40’s did not change substantially between 1960 and 1970. These data would
suggest that while Mormon women may
continue to have more children than the
national average, they are not having their
children as early in their marriages as in
the recent past.

This trend can be seen as resulting from
a number of distinctive features of Mormon
culture. First of all, Mormons tend to marry
young. In 1970, the median age at which
married persons in Utah had been married
was 22.8 years for males and 20.2 years for
females. The comparable figures for the
total U.S. population were 23.4 years for
males and 20.7 years for females. The

Social Biology

church also places a great emphasis on
higher education, particularly for males.
Thus, many Mormon couples marry in their
late teens or early twenties and face years
of relatively low income while the husband
completes school, which often involves obtaining some sort of graduate degree. The
introduction of improved contraceptive
techniques in the sixties, such as the pill
and the I.U.D., seems to have enabled
many Mormon couples to postpone having
children until the husband’s education was
completed. During the 1960’s, a number of
high church leaders made statements taking
the position married couples should not
wait until the husband’s education was complete before starting a family. The fact that
these leaders felt a need to make these
Statements is an indirect indication that
this tendency did exist among young Mormon couples. However, the fact that the
overall level of Mormon fertility has remained high, particularly among women in
the later part of their reproductive years,
would seem to be an indication that when
Mormon couples do have children, they are
still likely to have more children than the
national average.
