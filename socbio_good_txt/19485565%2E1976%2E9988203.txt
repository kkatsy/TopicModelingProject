Contraception and Pregnancy After
Dropping Out of Family Planning Clinics:
A National Interview Survey in Jamaica

ABSTRACT: A random national sample of 299 clinic dropouts from the Jamaica National Family
Planning Program were interviewed at least five months beyond their first missed clinic appointment. Correlates of early (after 1 or 2 visits) versus late (3+ visits) dropping out, continued
contraceptive practice, and pregnancy since visiting the clinic were identified. The Health
Belief Model of “compliance” behavior is proposed as an appropriate theoretical basis for

future studies of clinic dropouts.

To estimate the relative success or failure
of national family programs, it has been
proposed (Bracken and Kas}, 1973) that
three groups of clients deserve our attention. These are: (a) women who continue
to attend family planning clinics versus
those who become “clinic dropouts”; (0)
women, including dropouts, who continue
to use their contraceptive versus those who
become “contraceptive dropouts”; and (c)
women who use their contraceptive but become “contraceptive failures” (measured
by unplanned pregnancy) because of incorrect use or some inherent imperfection
in the method itself. Over recent years a
considerable body of information has appeared on contraceptive dropouts, or on
what is also called contraceptive discontinuation or noncompliance (Whelan, 1974),
and on contraceptive failure, often somewhat misleadingly called contraceptive effectiveness (Segal and Tietze, 1971).

The clinic dropout, on the other hand,
has been the subject of much less intense

55

research interest. This is unfortunate since
a considerable proportion of all women
admitted to clinic programs become clinic
dropouts. Furthermore, not all women who
drop out of the clinic discontinue using contraception, and it would be useful to understand not only the correlates of dropping out but also of continued contraceptive practice after dropping out. It would
also be of interest to ascertain what influence even a brief exposure to a family
planning clinic may have on subsequent
fertility and contraception.

Dropping out shows some association
with the contraceptive used. Intrauterine
device users tend to drop out less often
than pill users (Keeny and Cernada, 1969;
Population Council, 1968; Hall, 1969), although in Mexico City this difference disappeared as the observation period increased (Keller, 1971). In Jamaica, rural
clients given the IUD had higher dropout
rates, while urban clients had higher rates
with jelly, cream, foams, diaphragm, and

condoms but not the pill (Bracken and
Kasl, 1973). In some studies, dropouts
have been found to be either very young
or of relatively older age (Kanagaratnam
and Kim, 1969; Gordis et al., 1970;
Bracken and Kasl, 1973). In Mexico City,
however, no differences were found on demographic variables between dropouts and
active clients (Keller, 1971).

In Jamaica, other demographic variables
were also significantly associated with an
increased likelihood of dropping out of the
program. These variables included: being
single; having 2 or over 7 living children;
having experienced no miscarriages; and
having been most recently pregnant over
a year before joining the program. The
effects of union, age, and number of children were relatively independent and additive. Thus, women in legal or commonlaw marriage, between 20 and 39 years of
age who had between 2 and 7 living children were most likely to stay in the program. The effects of having experienced a
miscarriage were especially strong among
married women of intermediate age with
few living children. The effect of a recent
pregnancy was particularly strong among
single clients of intermediate age. The
higher dropout rates among single clients
and those last pregnant over a year before
joining the program were found principally
among rural clients (Bracken and Kasl,
1973).

In Mexico City, dropping out occurred
most frequently in the period immediately
after the initial clinic visit (Keller, 1971),
while in Jamaica over half the dropouts
did so after one or two visits. Factors differentiating early from late dropouts in
Jamaica were similar to those discriminating dropouts from active clients. Thus,
young women were not only more likely
to drop out but also to drop out earlier
rather than later (Bracken and Kasl,
1973).

Social Biology

Two other observations should be made
about previous studies of family planning
clinic dropouts. First, the calculation of
dropout rates is influenced by the operational definition of dropout and by the
length of observation period. These factors
have differed between studies and may account for the considerable variation in reported dropout rates. Second, the interrelationships of variables found to be associated with dropping out need to be articulated into a more substantial theoretical
frame work that also accounts for other
factors, such as motivation and personality.

In this paper, the results of a national
interview sample of Jamaican clinic dropouts are reported. The discussion is organized around the Health Belief Model
(Rosenstock, 1960, 1966, and 1974) as recently modified to account for ‘“compliance” behavior which considers factors associated with continuing medical treatment
(Becker et al., 1974; Becker, 1974). Since
the model is used here ex post facto, it
serves only as a framework for discussing
the study findings. At the same time, it
suggests what may be a suitable theoretical
framework for the a priori selection of
variables in future studies of clinic dropouts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The population of Jamaica is approximately 1.9 million, the birth rate 31.5, and
the death rate 7.2 (all rates are per 1,000
population), giving a rate of natural increase of 24.3. This increase has led to
40 per cent of the population being under
15 years of age (Nortman, 1974). As a result, large numbers of women still have
their whole reproductive life ahead of them
and any reduction in population growth in
Jamaica must come from a reduction in
individual fertility.

The need for family planning was recog

nized early in Jamaica, and the first voluntary program, the Birth Control League,
was established in 1939 (Gold, 1967; Harewood, 1968). In 1967, the National Family
Planning Board was established to coordinate all government efforts in family planning, and the National Family Planning
Act of 1970 gave the Board full statutory
powers in this area.

During its first year, the Jamaica National Family Planning Board enrolled
29,892 clients who represented 6.4 per cent
of the estimated 470,000 women aged 1544 in Jamaica. During the same period,
there were 28,471 occasions when a client
missed a single appointment. Of clients
who had missed one visit, about 70 per
cent went on to miss a second visit, and
62 per cent missed a third consecutive visit.

A two-stage sampling technique was utilized to obtain clients for the study. Clinics
were randomly selected from four parishes:
the major urban one (Kingston) and one
from each of three strata of rural parishes
grouped according to their average dropout rate during the preceding twelve
months, The urban parish was disproportionately oversampled because it had significantly more new admissions than any
other parish. Within selected clinics, cases
were identified as every tenth client whose
third consecutive month of absence was
reported during June, July, and August,
1969. Clinic records were checked for accuracy and to exclude clients who had returned to the clinic in the two months between the three-month period of delinquency and sampling. A five-consecutivemonth period of delinquency was selected
because clients could not be interviewed
as soon as they were sampled and also
because it increased the observation period
for examining contraceptive practice and
pregnancy experience of clients after dropping out,

All interviewers were women: 6 Jamai
Family Planning Dropouts in Jamaica 57

cans and 2 Trinidadians—3 nurses, 3 social workers, and 2 graduate students.
Training sessions followed those developed
during a previous Jamaican fertility survey
(Back and Stycos, 1959; Stycos, 1954 and
1960; Stycos and Back, 1964) and included: interviewing techniques, family
planning methodology, and the organization of the Jamaican family planning program. Interviewers were not told the project specifically concerned clinic dropouts.
The interview lasted from 10 to 35 minutes
per respondent, No one refused to be interviewed, the majority of women welcoming the interview as an opportunity to further their knowledge about family planning.!

A major problem was locating the selected client. Not infrequently, especially
in the urban area, the given address referred to an area containing as many as
one hundred dweliings. Some respondents
had moved or were not home (at least
three attempted home visits were made).
Tracing clients was aggravated because the
name given at the clinic differed from the
name the client was known by to her
friends and neighbors. It was possible to
compare some variables from the interview
with data obtained from the clinic record
to ensure that the “right” person was interviewed. No discrepancies were identified
during these analyses. In all, 299 former
clients were interviewed representing a 93
per cent interview response rate.

1 Interviewers were told they could answer factual questions by the woman interviewed once the
interview was completed. They were asked not to
give personal opinions about family planning, although this is a difficult task, and the interviewers’
bias in favor of family planning must have been
obvious in answering questions. This bias may
have led to some contamination of responses when
an interviewer revisited the same street or “yard”
and interviewed a friend or neighbor. Since the
sample is such a small proportion of the population, this contamination would be a rare event if
it occurred at all. To further reduce the effect of
rumor, we attempted to interview all clients from
one area at the same time.

The results examine two issues: (1)
continued contraceptive practice after dropping out, a measure of “compliance”; and
(2) the pregnancy experience since visiting the clinic. In presenting the results,
the statistic gamma (Goodman and Kruskal, 1954) has been used and is reported
when appropriate to show the strength of
observed associations together with its level
of significance.

RESULTS

At the time of their first clinic visit,
subsequent dropouts were, on the average,
26.9 years old (s.p. = 6.5) and single or in
a common-law union? rather than married
(36.5, 41.4, and 22.1 per cent, respectively). At first pregnancy these women
were, on the average, 18.2 years old (s.pD.,
2.9) and during the subsequent years had
experienced an average of 4.6 pregnancies
(s.D., 2.7) of which the majority were live
births, a mean of 4.3 pregnancies (s.D.,
2.5) per woman at first visit. The great
majority of first pregnancies occurred outside a stable relationship (70.6, 23.0, and
6.4 per cent being single, in common-law,
and in marital unions, respectively). The
sampling procedures provided 190 women
from urban clinics and 109 from rural ones.
In all, 52.5 per'cent had stopped visiting
the clinics after 1 or 2 visits (35.1 per cent
after 1 visit) and 47.5 per cent after three
or more visits (35.1 per cent after 4+
visits).

2 Common-law unions are stable cohabiting relationships without any legal or religious sanction.
Marriage is entered into relatively late in life and
represents an improvement in a woman’s social
status. While many common-law unions lead to
marriage, this is not necessarily true, and many
dissolve to be followed by another common-law
union (Blake, 1961). It has been suggested that
common-law unions in rural areas may be stable
and more permanent, whereas in urban areas they
may be of shorter duration reflecting more constantly changing Liaisons (Schlesinger, 1968).

Social Biology

CONTRACEPTIVE EXPERIENCE OF DROPOUTS
SINCE FIRST CLINIC VISIT

Approximately 90 per cent of women
who subsequently dropped out of the clinic
started using contraception after their first
visit (Table 1). As we might expect, of the
32 women who did not start family planning, all but one made only 1 or 2 visits
prior to dropping out. Women from urban
clinics were almost twice as likely not to
have started contraception when compared
to rural women (gamma=0.29, p<
0.05). When asked why they had not
started using contraception, the most common reasons were the inconvenient opening times or location of the clinic (53.8
per cent of all responses). Other reasons,
in rank order, included finding that she
was pregnant, objections by partner, fear
of side-effects, left the area, and lost or
changed partner.

The most common method used was the
pill followed by the TUD. Coitus-dependent methods (cream/foams, diaphragm,
and condoms) were least likely to be chosen.
Moreover, women wno used the pill and
IUD were significantly more likely to have
made more clinic visits before dropping
out (Table 1). Rural women were significantly less likely to have been given coitusindependent methods than were their urban
counterparts (gamma = 0.76, ~ < 0.01).

Respondents were asked why they chose
one method of birth control over the others.
Recommendations of friends was most frequently given as a reason (19.4 per cent
of all reasons), and this was particularly
true of pill usage. Convenience of use also
ranked high as a consideration (18.7 per
cent of all reasons) and was the principal
reason among IUD users. The influence of
clinic personnel ranked third as a reason
for choosing a contraceptive (15.0 per
cent), although a disturbingly large number of women felt they had not been ofDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

fered a choice of contraceptives (10.2 per
cent). Other reasons for choosing a method
were: unsatisfactory previous experience
with other methods; method was believed
to be “safer”; or it was a stopgap before
starting the pill (13.9, 13.2, and 2.6 per
cent, respectively). No particular reason
was given by 7.0 per cent. The reason for
choosing a particular method was unrelated with number of clinic visits before
dropping out. Women in urban areas were
most likely to have been influenced by recommendations of partner and friends and
the fact that the method was convenient
to use, whereas rural women were influenced most by the clinic nurse or physician
and the consideration that the method was
safer.

Respondents who started contraception
were asked: ‘“‘What is the correct way to
use ... (the method chosen).” Interviewers were trained to recognize, for each contraceptive technique, errors in usage that
would increase the risk of contraceptive

 

failure. Only 9 per cent of the respondents
could not give a satisfactory answer to this
question, but they were significantly more
likely to have dropped out of the program
early (Table 2).

Two-thirds of the respondents reported
they had been troubled by contraceptive
side-effects. Reported side-effects did not
correlate with length of contact at the clinic
before dropping out (Table 1). Women
from rural clinics, however, tended to be
more likely to report being troubled by
their contraceptive than urban women
(gamma = 0.15, p = 0.05).

A first and an additional complaint about
the contraceptive were solicited and these
complaints are shown, by method, in Table 2. Here, of course, we are using a selfreport measure of the client’s perceived
problems. While the medical validity of the
symptom is uncertain, the client’s own perception of the symptom may well be a
reliable predictor of clinic dropout and
contraceptive discontinuation. There was

an overall association between the method
used and reported problems. There was a
significant excess of reported side-effects
among pill and IUD users compared with
coitus-dependent method users (gamma =
0.25, p< 0.01). Reported nausea and
fainting, bleeding, and pain were largely
associated with the pill and IUD. Fatigue
was a common report among pill users.

Women who had been using the pill were
asked a series of questions to ascertain the
extent of problems specific to that method.
Approximately a third of these women reported they had missed taking the pill, but
this fact was not associated with number
of clinic visits before dropping out. The
majority of these women (87.5 per cent)
reported they had missed “taking the pill
daily” rather than forgetting each month
“when to begin taking a new packet of
pills.” Urban women were significantly
more likely to miss the pill daily (gamma
= 0.68, p < 0.01), whereas rural women
were more than twice as likely to miss
taking a new packet each month (gamma
= 0.49, p< 0.05).

Approximately 40 per cent of respondents had used some form of family planning since dropping out of the clinic, and
longer contact with the clinic prior to drop
ping out was strongly associated with continued contraceptive practice (Table 1).
Women from rural clinics were significantly
less likely to have continued using contraception (gamma = 0.19, p < 0.05).

Other variables were re-examined for
their association with continued practice.
These analyses showed that the demographic relationships tend to reflect those
reported previously between dropouts and
active cases. Women who continued contraception tended to be older, of higher
parity, to have had more years in school,
and to have been older at first pregnancy,
although none of these differences reached
statistical significance. Women continuing
contraception were significantly more likely
to be currently married (gamma — 0.18,
p< 0.01), and to have been married at
first pregnancy (gamma = 0.22, p < 0.01),
and to have last been pregnant either within
the previous year or more than three years
previously (gamma = 0.12, p < 0.05).

Women who continued contraception
more often stopped visiting the clinic because the time was inconvenient (gamma
= 0.55, p < 0.01) and, even though they
waited the same length of time at the
clinic as women who went on to discontinue contraception, they were more likely

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

Vol. 23, No. 1

to drop out because they were troubled by
the waiting time (gamma=0.30, p<
0.01), a relationship which remained unchanged within all union categories. Not
surprisingly, women who continued contraception were less likely to report being
troubled by contraceptive side-effects
(gamma = 0.36, ~< 0.01), although 38
per cent of women continuing contraception did so in spite of side-effects. Discussion and agreement with partner did not
relate to continuation of contraception
when marital status was controlled. However, single women were more likely to
continue using contraception if the partner
did not know it was being used (gamma =
0.38, p< 0.01). Women whose friends
were supportive of family planning were
also more likely to continue contraception
(gamma = 0.25, p < 0.01).

When respondents were asked what
method was being used after dropping out,
it was apparent that, compared with methods given at the clinic, there was increased
reliance upon coitus-dependent methods.
The principal source of supplies for these
methods, in rank order, was: (1) supplies
left over from clinic visit (36.9 per cent),
(2) a store (18.4 per cent), (3) respondent
had returned to the clinic for supplies between veing sampled and interviewed (16.7
per cent), and (4) respondent had sent
friends to the clinic to obtain supplies for
her (15.8 per cent). Very few women had
gone to another clinic (8.8 per cent) or to
a private physician (3.4 per cent) for their
contraceptives.

PREGNANCY EXPERIENCE SINCE
DROPPING OUT
The interview enabled us to inquire
about pregnancy experiences since the respondent dropped out of the clinic, and
the pertinent data are presented in Table
3. Only six women stopped visiting the
family planning clinic because they wanted

Family Planning Dropouts in Jamaica

61

to become pregnant. Of the great majority
of women who did not drop out because
they wanted to conceive, over a quarter
were pregnant at the time of being interviewed. The number of visits to the clinic
before dropping out did not correlate with
pregnancy. Only five of the women pregnant at interview had planned their pregnancy, and four of these women had longer
contact at the clinic prior to dropping out.
Over half of the women who had an unplanned pregnancy reported “using birth
control at the time,” but this contraceptive
use did not correlate with length of previous clinic contact.

Two-thirds of the women who had become pregnant gave pregnancy as their
reason for dropping out. However, women
who had made three or more visits to the
clinic were significantly more likely to report that they had dropped out before becoming pregnant. Over 90 per cent of the
total sample expected to continue with
family planning after the baby was born.
This expectation was significantly greater
among women who had a longer record of
clinic contact.

DISCUSSION

The Health Belief Model as it may apply to continued clinic attendance, length
of attendance at the clinic before dropping
out, and contraception after dropping out
is shown in Figure 1. A strong relationship
was observed between period of clinic attendance prior to dropping out and continued contraception since visiting the
clinic—the more visits before dropping out,
the better the chance of continued contraception. Of interest to us in the discussion
are similarities and differences in the correlates of compliance discussed in this paper.

attend the clinic and continue contraception. Not all of the components suggested
in the model were operationalized in the
study. It is probably fair to assume few
women wanted to become pregnant, especially since so few of those who did conceive admitted it was planned. A measure
of the strength of the wish not to become
pregnant may be the number of pregnancies a woman has had and recency of last
pregnancy. Women last pregnant more
than one but less than three years previously were more likely to have discontinued
contraception, a curvilinear relationship
deserving further investigation.

A second group’ of variables concern the
threat, or costs (psychological and economic), of not visiting the clinic and continuing contraception, This area is not covered by this or previous studies of clinic
dropouts and merits considerable attention
in future research. Variables focusing on
perceived longer-term costs of childbearing,
including chances of the child surviving?
as well as the more immediate costs of
pregnancy, need to be explored. We have
shown previously that women who had recent miscarriages were less likely to drop
out and if they were a dropout to have
stayed longer in the program (Bracken
and Kas], 1973). To these women, fear of
miscarriage may represent an increased
threat of pregnancy (possibly for superstitious as well as physical reasons) in
addition to their not wanting another child.

Even women predisposed toward visiting
the clinic and continuing contraception and

mortality was not influenced by having a father
living in the home and the type of family group
in which the child lived (McKenzie et al., 1967).

is a high possibility their behavior will be
successful. Again in this study, as in others,
this area was not formally considered. Responses to the open-ended question on reasons for choosing a particular contraceptive
method only suggest the importance of a
belief in the effectiveness of a method as
well as the ability to choose that method.
The accuracy of information about contraceptive methods, however, is important,
and the finding that friends and partners
may be more influential in the choice of
a method than clinic staff is not reassuring.

Given a psychological readiness to take
action, some additional event is necessary
to “trigger” that action. Thus, many women
still active in family planning clinics may
be psychologically prepared to drop out
but have not done so because their contraceptive is not troubling them. Other women
may be psychologically ready to practice
contraception but discontinued because
their partner objected. Triggers to action
are more obvious variables to study, more
easily measured, and more readily verbalized by a respondent and therefore have
received more attention by investigators.
Contraceptive side-effects have been reported to be a principal reason for dropping out of family planning clinics and for
discontinuing contraception. Women who
drop out because of side-effects, however,
have stayed in the program as long as those
who do not report side-effects. Of course,
many side-effects do not appear until a
contraceptive has been used for some time,
whereas others take less time to develop
which may account for the absence of an
association. Larger samples should permit
examination of the independent and interactive effects of method, type of side-effect,
and influence on behavior.

Among women who dropped out, the
partner’s influence was only associated
with continued contraception among single
women who practiced more contraception

when the partner was ignorant of its use.
Other women who dropped out because of
side-effects or pregnancy were not using
contraception, even though their partner
might support such use, whereas other
women used contraception despite dropping out of the clinic and their partner’s
opposition.

The advice of professionals did not trigger dropping out. While a physician might
advise a woman to discontinue a contraceptive method because of side-effects, he
would usually prescribe an alternative
method. The influence of rumor and information from friends on compliance has
not been systematically studied among
clinic dropouts. While rumor may influence
discontinuation of contraception, as happened after the United States Senate investigation of the pill (Ross, 1970), it may
play an equally important role in maintaining women as active clients and contraceptive users. This more positive aspect
of rumor has to date received scant attention.

Finally, we consider a group of variables
which may “modify” the relationships between psychological factors influencing
readiness to act and various triggers to action. While younger women might be reluctant to practice contraception against
the wishes of their partner, older women
may be more resistant to their partner’s
opinion. We have seen that demographic
characteristics—-young age, being single,
low parity, and few living children, for example—are quite strongly associated with
dropping out, dropping out relatively
quickly, and discontinuing contraception.

One of the principal reasons for our inability to accurately predict those women
at high risk for dropping out of a family
planning clinic, dropping out early, and
discontinuing contraception after dropping
out is our failure to examine the more complex relationships between psychological

readiness to act, various triggers to act,
and factors modifying these relationships.
The Health Belief Model of “compliance”
is One way of organizing variables of interest into a testable model. The model
itself, however, still requires additional development. It is not clear at the present
time what the precise criteria are for calling one variable a “trigger” and another a
“predisposition.” Moreover, the same variable may play each theoretical role in different women. Certainly other groups of
variables will also need to be considered,
such as stable personality measures, psychological measures reflecting one’s ability
to cope with conflict (such as ego resiltence), more acute measures of partner’s
supportiveness (and of mother’s supportiveness in younger women) as well as of
the influence of peers. While methodologically more difficult, it would be helpful to
undertake prospective studies of compliance behavior for samples of all women
admitted to family planning programs.
Only after more thorough research will
family planning professionals have a better
understanding of who will stay in their
programs, as well as the information to
assist clients in complying with their own
family planning decisions, rationally and
free from the pressures of others.
