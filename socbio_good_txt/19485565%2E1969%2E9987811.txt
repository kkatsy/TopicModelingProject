New Quarterly Publication of the International

Planned Parenthood Federation

To assist in the dissemination of new
knowledge in reproductive physiology and
to provide information on current events of
relevance to this field of study, a new bulletin entitled Research in Reproduction is being
published by the International Planned
Parenthood Federation under the editorship of Dr. Robert Edwards. It is intended
to be of interest to the specialist research
worker, the medical doctor, and the general
reader. Contents will include reviews by
particular scientists, summaries of certain
areas of research, and descriptions of people
or places of unique interest.

In the first issue, January, 1969, the sci
entific contents include a review by Dr.
R. L. Brinster on the metabolism of preimplantation mammalian embryos and three
shorter articles on antibodies and conception, antiprogestins, and gonocytes and
sex determination. Two articles of topical
interest describe the International House of
Scientists, Varna, Bulgaria, and the services provided by the Bibliography of Reproduction.

Four numbers will be issued per year.
The other publications of the IPPF include
the monthly International Planned Parenthood News and the quarterly JPPF Medical
Bulletin.
