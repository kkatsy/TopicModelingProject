Men’s Desire for Additional Wives
and Children

ABSTRACT: In sub-Saharan Africa, the majority of fertility and family planning studies are of
women. By ignoring men, these studies overlook the primary fertility and family decision
makers. This study uses male data from Cameroon to examine how currently monogamous men
make fertility and nuptial decisions. Three analyses are discussed. First, an analysis of monogamous men’s desire for additional wives is presented. Second, an analysis of monogamous men’s
desire for additional children is presented. Finally, the two desires are examined simultaneously
to disentangle the relationship between these two family desires. Three possible interrelationships
between monogamous men’s two family desires (desire for wives and desire for children) are
examined and discussed. The results indicate that men’s desire for more children drives their
desire for additional wives and not the contrary. The implications of this finding for high fertility

in areas where polygyny is common are discussed.

Men are the primary fertility
decision-makers in Africa (IsiugoAbanihe, 1994) but are rarely the focus
of fertility and family planning research (Adamchak and Mbizvo, 1991).
Studies of men are needed (1) to assess
how men make fertility decisions and
to determine the factors associated
with family planning use among men;
(2) to examine if men’s fertility desires
are linked to other family desires (e.g.,
polygyny); (3) to determine if men’s
fertility desires are changing; and (4) to
ascertain if men are women’s barrier to
family planning use. This paper focuses
on the second of these research areas.
In particular, I study men’s two-family
desires, desire for multiple wives and
desire for many children, and the link
between them.

Men’s desire for multiple wives (polygyny) is of interest to potential fertility transitions because, where polygyny is common, women may be less
likely to act on their own changing fer
tility desires. Two examples make this
clear. In the first case, a woman who no
longer wants children may continue reproducing to avoid her husband’s taking another wife for reproductive purposes (a fear or dislike of polygyny)
(Fapohunda and Todaro, 1988). In the
second case, a woman in a polygynous
union who no longer wants children
may continue reproducing to compete
for valued male resources gained by
having children (Adewuyi, 1987).
Therefore, where polygyny is common, women who no longer want children may not adopt family planning
because bearing children remains their
only way to influence union type and
gain economic resources.

The decision to become polygynous
is predominantly the man’s in subSaharan Africa. Some reasons men
choose to be in polygynous unions
are (1) to gain prestige and status
by having multiple wives (Ahmed,
1986; Ukaegbu, 1977); (2) to acquire

199

200

additional agricultural labor through
wives and their children (Ukaegbu,
1977); (3) to have additional sexual
partners while one wife is abstaining
because of breastfeeding (van de Walle
and van de Walle, 1989); and (4) to
have another woman available to reproduce, especially if the first wife is
infertile (Dorjahn, 1958).

The second family desire I examine
is men’s desire for additional children.
As men’s fertility desires decline, it is
hypothesized that fertility levels will
subsequently decline, assuming fertility desires are communicated to wives
and that family planning is acceptable,
available, and affordable.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the decision
to have children is predominantly the
man’s (Fapohunda and Todaro, 1988;
Lee and Bulatao, 1983). Some reasons
that men (and women) want many children in sub-Saharan Africa are that
children are viewed as an investment in
the future for financial security (Caldwell, 1983); children offer additional
labor for agricultural work (Acsadi and
Johnson-Acsadi, 1990); and having
many children gains prestige and status
in the community (Isiugo-Abanihe,
1994).

Previous research on African men
has found that men in polygynous
unions are more likely to desire
additional children than men in monogamous unions (e.g., Adamchak
and Adebayo, 1987; Isiugo-Abanihe,
1994). What is unclear from this finding is the direction of causality between
men’s desire for children and their desire for multiple wives. Do men in polygynous unions want more children to
satisfy the childbearing needs of their
multiple wives? Do men who want

Social Biology

many children take additional wives to
attain reproductive goals? Or, do some
men want both wives and children
based on an underlying desire for large
families (e.g., a need for the additional
labor of wives and children)?

Although the situations above
sound similar (polygyny leads to desire
for children, desire for children leads
to polygyny, or both desires act simultaneously), they have different implications for the future of a fertility decline in sub-Saharan Africa. First, if
having multiple wives leads men to
want many children, then for fertility
to decline, men’s desire to take multiple wives (polygyny) would have to decline first. Second, if men’s desire for
more children leads to their taking additional wives, then for fertility to decline, men’s desire for children would
have to decline first (and subsequently
polygyny would decline). Third, if an
underlying desire for large families
leads some men to want multiple wives
and many children, then for fertility
to decline the factors that affect both
desires may have to change.

This study attempts to disentangle
the relationships between men’s desire
for multiple wives and their desire
for many children. Three analyses
are performed. First, I analyze the
determinants of monogamous men’s
desire for additional wives (marital intentions analysis). Second, I examine
the factors associated with a desire
for children among monogamous men
(fertility intentions analysis). Third, I
examine the factors associated with
monogamous men’s desire for multiple
wives and additional children (marital
and fertility intentions analysis). The
results of the third analysis are useful

to assess which of the three hypothesized relationships between desire for
wives and desire for children is the
most appropriate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA

I use data from the 1991 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey
(CDHS) because the husbands of a
random sample of women age 15-49
were interviewed,! and a new question
on a man’s intention to take another
wife in the future was included. Hence,
it is possible to examine men’s desire
for wives as well as their desire for
children.

The total sample of husbands in the
CDHS is 814. For these analyses, only
the 618 men who are currently in a monogamous union and who responded to
the question on future marital intentions are included. The polygynous
men are excluded because we do not
know their desire for children at the
time they took a second or higher order
wife and became polygynous.

DEPENDENT VARIABLES

For the marital intentions analysis,
monogamous men are divided into two
groups based on their response to the
question: Do you intend to take another (other) wife (wives) in the future? The two groups of monogamous
men are those men who intend to remain monogamous in the future (truly
monogamous men) and those men who
intend to take another wife in the fu

see Balépa et al., 1992, and Speizer, 1994.

ture (potentially polygynous men).
The dependent variable for this analysis is scored 1 if the man is potentially
polygynous (38.03 per cent) and 0 otherwise (truly monogamous men, 61.97
per cent).

For the fertility intentions analysis,
monogamous men are divided into two
groups based on their response to a
question on whether they would like
any more children in the future. This
variable is scored 1 if the man reports
wanting additional children (85.24 per
cent) and 0 for all men who report that
they want no more children or that
they can no longer have children (14.76
per cent). Men who are undecided on
future childbearing and men who report that their wife can no longer have
children are eliminated from this analysis (N = 36).2

Finally, for the marital and fertility
intentions analysis, monogamous men
are divided into four groups: (1) those
who intend to remain monogamous
and do not want additional children
(11.98 per cent); (2) those who intend
to remain monogamous and want additional children (48.96 per cent); (3)
those who intend to become polygynous and to not want additional children (2.78 per cent); and (4) those who
intend to become polygynous and want
additional children (36.28 per cent).
Because only a small number of men
want additional wives but not additional children (N = 16), this group is
not included in the multivariate analyses. The analysis uses the remaining
three groups of monogamous men with
differing marriage and fertility desires.

2An examination of how these 36 men differ
from the remaining men revealed no significant differences between the two groups.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SAMPLE
(INDEPENDENT VARIABLES)

As a consequence of only including
monogamous men, some bias is introduced into the sample relative to the
sample of all husbands from Cameroon. Table 1 presents descriptive information on the sample of monogamous men. By including only the
monogamous men, the sample is less
rural and more educated than the sample of all husbands in the CDHS (see

Speizer, 1995, for the distribution of
the entire sample). Other characteristics of the sample associated with the
monogamous men bias are (1) a
greater percentage of Christian men;
(2) younger mean age; (3) smaller
mean number of children; and (4) less
likelihood that the monogamous men
work in the agriculture sector. Each
of these factors (except agricultural
work) is associated with being polygynous (Speizer, 1994).

HyYPoTHESES

The independent variables for the
marital intentions analysis are shown in
Table 2. Monogamous men from rural
areas are hypothesized to be more
likely to intend to be polygynous because (1) they need the female labor

(Dorjahn, 1988; Lee and Whitbeck,
1990); (2) they can afford more wives
because wives are less expensive in
rural areas (Dorjahn, 1988); and (3)
they receive prestige from the community for having multiple wives (Ukaegbu, 1977). For the marital intentions
analysis, dummy variables for place of

204

residence are created (Yaoundé/
Douala, other urban,? rural). Education, number of household possessions, type of floor in the dwelling, and
type of work are all associated with
place of residence and are included as
dummy variables in this analysis.

The effects of education and wealth
on men’s desire for additional wives is
uncertain. For example, men who are
less educated are hypothesized to be
more likely to intend to become polygynous as they are less likely to have
been exposed to the modernizing
influences that discourage polygyny
(Aryee, 1978; Ukaegbu, 1977). On the
other hand, men with secondary education may also be more likely to intend to become polygynous because
they can afford multiple wives (Brown,
1981). Similarly, wealth* may have
positive or negative effects on polygyny (wealthy men can afford more
wives, or are more modernized and
may be less likely to want multiple
wives).

A recent phenomenon in some urban areas is that wealthy, educated
men have multiple partners who are
not necessarily considered wives (informal polygyny) (Magnani et al.,
1995). This phenomenon results in urban men appearing less polygynous
than they really are. Future analyses
controlling for number of partners will
help to determine the level and effect
of this informal polygyny.

3Any town other than Yaoundé and Douala with
a population greater than 5,000 is classified as
“Other Urban” while “Rural’’ includes all smaller
villages.

‘Wealth is measured as number of household
possessions and type of floor in the dwelling, since
no specific measure of wealth is available in the
CDHS.

Speizer

 

Social Biology

Also included in this analysis is religion (Christian, Muslim, traditional).
Men who are Muslim or of a traditional
religion are liypothesized to be more
likely to intend to become polygynous
through positive social supports for polygyny in these religions (Brown, 1981;
Clignet, 1970).5 Finally, dummy variables for duration of marriage (<5
years, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21+) are
included. Previous studies have found
that it is after the first five to seven
years of monogamous marriage that a
man is more likely to take another wife
and become polygynous (or intend
to become polygynous) (Chojnacka,
1980; Donadje and Tabutin, 1991).

For the fertility intentions analysis
(see Table 3), the majority of the background variables above are included
as well as several additional variables.
Place of residence and type of employment are included since it is hypothesized that men from rural areas and
men who work in the agricultural sector would be more likely to want additional children because children are
inexpensive and useful for labor (Acsadi and Johnson-Acsadi, 1990). Also
included in this analysis are level of education, number of household possessions, and type of floor in the dwelling.

Education and wealth may have
positive or negative effects on the desire for additional children because
educated, wealthy men are more likely
to be able to afford many children,
but these same men may desire fewer,
quality children (Boraie et al., 1988;
Cochrane et al., 1988). Since both
education and wealth are correlated
with place of residence, I examine their

sAlthough this hypothesis may be valid, 47 per
cent of polygynous men in the CDHS are Christian
(unweighted value, Speizer, 1994).

effects in multivariate analyses, controlling for place of residence.

Also included in this analysis are religion (Christian, Muslim, traditional),
age (<30, 30-39, 40-49, 50+), and
number of living children (0-2, 3-4,
5-6, 7+). Religion is included because
some religions (e.g., traditional) may
have stronger social supports for childbearing than other religions (Caldwell
and Caldwell, 1987). This analysis
controls for age and number of living
children (life cycle factors) because
men later in their life cycles are less
likely to desire additional children than
younger men (Boraie et al., 1988).
Similar analyses were performed using
the wife’s age. These analyses found
similar life cycle effects. Matched analyses are not presented because the
sample size is reduced because not all
men match with a wife, and the results
do not differ greatly.

Finally, I include a categorical variable for whether or not the man reports
having discussed family size desires
with his spouse. Discussion of desired
family size with the spouse could be
seen as a cause of wanting fewer children, or it could be a consequence of
changed family desires. This analysis
cannot determine which case is the
most appropriate. I include the discussion variable as it may affect fertility
desires directly, or it may be a proxy
for a more egalitarian husband and
wife relationship which is associated
with changing fertility desires (IsiugoAbanihe, 1994).

For the marital and fertility intentions analysis, all the independent variables in the two previous analyses are
included (with the exception of duration of marriage because of the high

marriage and age). This analysis assesses whether the factors associated
with one desire are more important in
the determination of the joint desires,
or if the combination of both sets of
factors is important.

ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES

Logistic regression techniques are
used for the marital intentions analysis
and the fertility intentions analysis. Logistic regression is appropriate for
these analyses as each dependent outcome is dichotomous with mutually exclusive categories where the sum of the
probabilities over both categories is
equal to one (Hanushek and Jackson,
1977; Kleinbaum, 1991). For the marital and fertility intentions analysis,
multinomial logistic regression techniques are used. Multinomial logistic
regression is appropriate here because
the dependent outcome is trichotomous with unordered mutually exclusive categories where the sum of the
probabilities over all categories is
equal to one (Hanushek and Jackson,
1977).

RESULTS

In the CDHS, roughly 40 per cent of
currently monogamous men intend to
become polygynous sometime in the
future. The results of a logistic regression examining the similarities and differences between these two groups of
currently monogamous men are presented in Table 2. This analysis finds
that monogamous men who are Muslim or practice a traditional religion are
significantly more likely to intend to
become polygynous than Christian monogamous men. On all other factors
(e.g., education, residence, wealth, ocDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

Vol. 42, No. 3-4

cupation, and duration of marriage),
the two groups of currently monogamous men are the same. These results
are similar to those found by Speizer
(1995) who demonstrated that typical
marriage analyses which group all currently monogamous men_ together
misclassify those men who only see
monogamy as a State of potential transition prior to becoming polygynous.

For the fertility intentions analysis,
all monogamous men are included
without considering their desire for an
additional wife (wives). In the CDHS,
the majority of monogamous men want
additional children in the future (85.3
per cent). This finding is not unexpected because in Sub-Saharan Africa
there remain many social supports for
high fertility and few motivations to reduce fertility levels (van de Walle and
Omideyi, 1988).

In Table 3, the results of the fertility
intentions analysis are presented. Because bivariate analyses (tables not
shown) suggest that there would be differential effects of husband-wife communication at the various levels of
education, this analysis uses an interaction term between secondary education and discussion of family size desires. Table 3 shows that, controlling
for age and number of living children,
monogamous men from rural areas are
significantly more likely to desire additional children than monogamous
men from Yaoundé or Douala. This
finding could be based on the fact that
children are less expensive and more
useful to agricultural production in rural areas. In this model, there are no
effects of occupation and wealth (num

communication was also tested but was not significant and is not included in this model.

ber of household possessions and type
of floor). Conceivably, the residence
variable captures some of the effects
of these other variables. Finally, the
results of this analysis indicate that
husband-wife discussion is associated
with lower fertility desires only among
men with secondary education. For all
other men, discussion of family size desires has no effect on their current fertility desires. The discussion-education
interaction variable may be accounting
for a more egalitarian relationship or
may be reflecting men with secondary
education who are married to women
with greater education and thus as a
couple they are more likely to discuss
and resolve differences. Further analyses (based on couples as the unit of
analysis) are needed to determine the
direct and indirect effects of discussion
on changing fertility desires.

The final analysis (marital and fertility intentions) attempts to disentangle the relationship between men’s
desire for additional wives and their
desire for additional children. As discussed above, three possible relationships are hypothesized to exist between
men’s two desires. Men may desire
multiple wives and thus want many
children to please their wives’ childbearing needs; men may want more
children and to attain this reproductive
goal, want many wives; or some men
may want both wives and children
based on an underlying desire for large
families.

Men are divided into four groups
based on their marital and fertility desires. Table 4 presents the number and
percentage of men in each group. The
results of the multinomial logistic regression of the determinants of monogamous men’s desire for additional

wives and additional children are presented in Table 5. Three comparisons
are shown in Table 5. The first and last
comparison use the potentially polygynous men who want additional children as the reference group (Cols. 1
and 3); the second comparison uses the
truly monogamous men who do not
want additional children as the reference group (Col. 2). A summary of
the results of this table is presented in
Figure 1.

The analyses find results consistent
with the two previous sections. Among
men who want children, the comparison of the truly monogamous men to
the potentially polygynous men (Col. 1
of Table 5, and the right side of Figure
1), shows that the most important factor differentiating these two groups is
religion. Monogamous men who are
Muslim or practice a traditional religion are significantly more likely to
want additional wives than Christian
monogamous men. The other factor
that becomes significant in this comparison is age. Those men between the
ages of 30 and 49 are significantly more
likely to want additional wives than
men under 30, perhaps because men
aged 30-49 are in their prime productive and reproductive periods and are
more likely to be able to afford multi
ple wives than men under age 30. Also,
men who are between age 30 and 49
have been married for many years and
may be disinterested in their current
marriage and feel a need or desire for
a new wife. Finally, this comparison
does not find any difference for men
over age 50, perhaps because older
men who intended to become polygynous have already become so. Therefore, future marital desires have less
relevance to these older men.

The second comparison presented
in Table 5 is between the truly monogamous men who do not want children
and those who do (Col. 2 of Table 5,
and top part of Figure 1). This analysis
finds that, controlling for age and number of living children, men from rural
areas are significantly more likely to
desire additional children than men
from Yaoundé and Douala. Also,
among men with secondary education,
discussion of desired family size with
the spouse is associated with a desire
for no more children. The results of
this analysis are similar to those of the
fertility intentions analysis.

Finally, and most interestingly, the
comparison of monogamous men who
want neither additional wives nor children to monogamous men who want
both is presented in Column 3 of Table

Fic. 1.--Determinants of desire for additional wives and children among currently monogamous

men.

5 (summary of results presented on
diagonal line in Figure 1). This analysis finds that controlling for age and
number of living children, the men
from rural areas are significantly more
likely to desire additional wives and
children than the men from Yaoundé
and Douala. Also, among men with
secondary education, discussion of desired family size is associated with a
desire to remain monogamous and to
have no more children. The factors
that differentiate the men who do not
want additional wives or children from
the men who want more wives and children correspond to the factors associated with monogamous men’s desire
for additional children. This finding
suggests that it is men’s desire for more
children that drives their desire for additional wives, and not the contrary.

 

DISCUSSION

The first analysis demonstrates that
religion is the most important factor
that differentiates currently monogamous men who intend to remain monogamous from those who intend to
become polygynous. This result suggests that for men’s intentions to become polygynous to decline, religious
support for high fertility may need to
change so that polygyny becomes less
of a normative, accepted marriage
type. Large changes in religious values
are not expected in the near future
which suggests that polygyny (or at
least the intention to be polygynous)
may continue for a long time in SubSaharan Africa.

The second analysis examines the
factors associated with a desire for ad

ditional children among monogamous
men. This analysis finds that, controlling for age and number of living children, urban residence and reported
discussion of family size desires among
men with secondary education are associated with lower fertility desires.
Therefore, with continued urbanization, education, and programs to promote spousal communication, men’s
fertility desires should decline. With
these changes, if family planning is
acceptable, available, and affordable,
then we could expect a subsequent fertility decline.

The results of the third analysis
show that the differences between currently monogamous men who want
neither additional wives nor additional
children and currently monogamous
men who want both additional wives
and children are primarily related to
factors associated with a desire for
children. This result suggests that it
is men’s desire for children that determines their desire for multiple wives,
and not the reverse. This is the second
hypothesized relationship between
men’s two family desires, i.e., men
want children for reasons of status, financial security, labor, etc., and thus
they take multiple wives to attain reproductive goals.

If religion had been found to also
differentiate monogamous men who
want additional wives and children
from monogamous men who want neither wives nor children, then I would
have concluded that men’s nuptial
and fertility desires are jointly determined because religion is the determining factor in the marriage analysis.
Conceivably, religion is not a significant difference between these two
groups because only a small number of

Additional Wives

men want neither additional wives nor
children. If the sample were larger,
perhaps the effect of Muslim religion
would become significant. On the
other hand, the effect of traditional religion compared to Christianity was
small and insignificant in this analysis
(compared to large and significant in
the marriage analysis). Therefore, the
effect of religion appears less important than the effect of the factors associated with a desire for additional children. This finding is the basis of the
conclusion that monogamous men’s
desire for children drives their desire
for wives and high fertility.

Another factor that supports this
conclusion is that the group of monogamous men who want wives and no
children is small (N = 16). It is rare for
a monogamous man to desire wives but
not children, suggesting that the desire
for wives is associated with the desire
for children. On the other hand, a large
number of monogamous men desire
children but do not desire additional
wives. Thus, while the desire for more
children is independent of the desire
for additional wives, the reverse is not
the case, with rare exceptions.

The results of the analysis of monogamous men’s desire for wives and children are useful to assess the fate of
high fertility in areas where polygyny is
common. Although men’s marriage intentions are unlikely to change greatly
in the near future (as religious affiliations are unlikely to change), there is
hope for a fertility decline. With increased urbanization, education, and
programs to promote spousal communication, men’s desire for children is
expected to decline. As men begin to
desire fewer children (and begin to
communicate these changing desires),

212

women may become more likely to
adopt family planning when they no
longer want children because of less
fear of their husband’s taking additional wives for reproductive purposes.

To date, little is known about
whether men’s fertility desires have
been declining. It is possible that men’s
fertility desires have declined, but as
communication between spouses in
sub-Saharan Africa is rare (Caldwell
and Caldwell, 1990) these changed
family desires may remain unknown by
wives. Therefore, wives may reproduce based on normative views of high
male fertility desires (and fears of
polygyny), and not based on actual information on men’s changed fertility
desires.

The conclusion that men’s desire for
children leads to their desire for additional wives and thus high fertility, is
based on cross-sectional differences
that reflect a current relationship between men’s two family desires. This
conclusion relies on the assumption
that “‘cross-sectional differences in behavior mirror individual experiences
over time” (Pebley and Jones, 1981, p.
18). Also, this conclusion relies on the
assumption that men’s reported intentions reflect realistic fertility and marital options. Future fertility surveys of
men are needed (ideally including longitudinal panel studies) (1) to determine if men’s fertility desires are declining; (2) to assess whether men who
report intentions to become polygy

Social Biology

nous actually attain this goal (and the
reasons for attaining or not attaining
this goal); and (3) to evaluate whether
men who report a desire for additional
children actually have more children as
intended (and the reasons for having or
not having children). These research
areas would help to assess the usefulness of information on men’s fertility
and marital intentions and to confirm
or update the results of this paper
which are based on the limited crosssectional male data presently available. Also, it would be interesting to
replicate these analyses using other
Demographic and Health Survey data
to determine if men’s desire for children is the underlying determinant of
polygyny in other areas of sub-Saharan
Africa where polygyny is common.
