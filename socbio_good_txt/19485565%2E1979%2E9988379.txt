Socioeconomic Status

ABSTRACT: There has been no reported systematic attempt to quantify the relative unique contribution of multiple social and biologic maternal characteristics to birth weight and gestational time
among mothers of differing childhood socioeconomic backgrounds. We examined this issue in three
nativity cohorts from a population of 766 black prenatal clinic patients in New York City using a
series of stepwise hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Different variable sets contributed to
birth weight variance in each group, although total variance explained was similar for the three.
Since the foreign-born cohort represented a different higher childhood socioeconomic background,
but was similar to the other groups in current SES, the differing observed associations of variable
sets to birth weight may be related to childhood socioeconomic status. In all groups, social factors
show more effect on gestation among births more than 2,500 grams than for smaller babies and thus

account for more total explained birth weight variance for births over 2,500 grams.

There have been several multivariate
studies which investigated associations of
both social and biological factors with
birth weight (Kaminski et al., 1973;
Wiener and Milton, 1969; Weiss and Jackson, 1969; Ganguly et al., 1972; Rantakallio, 1969). Most of these have emphasized
the biological variables in the analysis.
Only one, the Rantakallio study, included
childhood social factors in the analysis.
None of these studies attempted to deal
with the time sequence in which the factors would be expected to operate. By not
allowing for the logical time order of effects in multivariate analyses, the
influence of childhood factors may be un
derestimated because of their correlation
with other factors accounting for larger
proportions of variance in the dependent
variable. In terms of prevention, however, it seems important to understand the
influence of the earliest links in a causal
chain, particularly when, unlike many of
the biological factors, they may be
modified by intervention.

We have presented associations of social and biological characteristics of the
mother with infant birth weight from our
study of three nativity cohorts of black women (Valanis and Rush, 1979). Foreignborn blacks were found to have higher
birth weights and longer gestational time

than the native-born comparison groups.
These advantages were associated with a
higher childhood socioeconomic status,
higher current socioeconomic status, and
with more positive health behaviors, particularly nonsmoking.

This paper attempts to examine the relationships among our variable sets and to
quantify their relative unique contribution
to birth weight. Since nativity was found
to represent different socioeconomic experiences in childhood, we hypothesized
that the relative contribution of links in
the causal chain should vary by nativity cohort.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In order to test the hypothesis, regression analyses were run separately for each
nativity group. Four different regressions
were carried out. The first was done on the

total sample for each cohort, using birth
weight as the dependent variable. Since,
in this first analysis, gestation at delivery
accounted for quite different relative proportions of variance in birth weight, the
same regression was run with gestation instead of birth weight as the dependent variable in order to see if the biosocial variables predict gestation better for some
groups than for others.

The results for the foreign-born cohort
differed from the other two nativity
groups in the above analyses both for birth
weight and for gestation. The foreignborn cohort was essentially a group of
birth weights over 2,500 grams (only 3.8
per cent with low birth weights), while the
other two groups had a considerable rate
of births under 2,500 grams (New York
City, 18.4 per cent; southern, 15.5 per
cent). In order to determine whether patterns similar to those for the foreign group

would emerge for the other two cohorts if
the social factors were predicting only the
normal birth weights, the above two regression analyses were run by nativity cohort on just those births over 2,500 grams.

Because it was hypothesized that the
independent variables held an ordered relationship to birth weight and to each
other, all the multiple regression analyses
were done in a stepwise hierarchical
fashion, ordering the entry of the variable
sets according to the time sequence of presumed effect. There were six sets of independent variables entered into the regression analysis. The sets were entered in the
order shown in Table 1.

The variance in the dependent variable
explained by Set 1, the control variables,
will be deleted from the total cumulative
R? in presentation of results. In other
words, the cumulative R? presented will
be a partial R?, giving only the contributions of the remaining five independent
variable sets.

The variables in each set were selected
from among the larger number of social
and biological variables included in the
Prenatal Project data. Selection was based
on two major criteria:

1. Variable was associated with birth
weight in the literature.

2. Variable had a zero order correlation
with birth weight of at least 0.1 for the total
study population.

The total number of independent variables was limited to 24 because of the small
number of subjects (79) in the foreignborn cohort, the smallest group. This allows for at least three cases per variable.

In order to maintain comparability of
design for the three cohorts, the same 24
variables were used for all the groups. Because of this restriction and the need to
limit the total number of independent varlables to 24, only the linear components of
relationships to birth weight are examined. No nonlinear terms are intro

duced into the analysis. The linearity varied considerably between the three
cohorts. For example, family size and
father’s occupation have a strong linear
relationship to birth weight in the foreignborn group but not in the New York City
and southern cohorts. |

Scattergrams were examined, plotting
the independent variables against birth
weight for the total population. There appeared to be sufficient linear relationships
with birth weight to justify the decision
not to use non-linear terms for the current
work in view of the other restricting factors. However, this area may be well
worth pursuing in future work.

In the presentation of data from the regression analyses, tables will contain the
following information:

1. R* change—the variance added to the
regression equation by the entrance into the
equation of that particular variable or variable set.

2. Cumulative R?—total cumulative varlance accounted for at each step of the anal
sis.

, 3. Simple r—zero order correlation of an

independent variable with the dependent

variable.

4. Partial r°-—represents the unique variance of a given independent variable. Since
it is not discussed in reference to each table,
a more complete discussion follows.

It must be noted here that the cumulative R? presented in the tables is not adjusted for sample size. Multiple correlations have a tendency to shrink or
decrease as sample size increases, since
the larger sample decreases the likelihood
of capitalizing on chance. The amount of
bias in a multiple correlation is related to
the number of independent variables
divided by the number of persons. When
this produces a ratio as high as 3:1 (as with
the foreign-born group in this study), the
R? is biased upwards. An adjusted R?
(shrunken R?) gives an unbiased estimate
of the multiple correlation. Because of the
small size of the foreign-born group, the

adjustment formula causes such severe
shrinkage of the R? that it becomes uninterpretable in comparing results across
groups. Since this study is concerned with
comparing which variable sets are contributing more to the regression equation relative to the other sets across nativity
groups, use of the unadjusted cumulative
R? is meaningful. The reader must bear in
mind that the total variance in the dependent variable predicted by the regression
equation cannot be taken as real due to
the differences in sample size of the
groups. What we are interested in is the
similarity or dissimilarity in patterns
across groups, 1.e., whether the same variables contribute birth weight variance in
all groups.

The partial 7? values in tables in this section are a measure of the variance accounted for by each variable when all the
other variables are controlled. Thus, itis a
measure of the unique variance contribution of a variable. Comparison of the partial r? value of a variable with the R?
change when the variable was added to the
regression equation gives some sense of
how much of the effect of that particular
variable is due to covariation with or confounding by some other variable(s). For
example, in the sequential regression data

presented in Table 3, for the New York
City group, education adds 1.8 per cent
variance to prediction of birth weight. The
partial 7? value for this variable indicates
that its unique variance contribution to
birth weight is only 0.7 per cent. Education apparently operates through or covaries with some other variables which
may come later, perhaps nutritional intake. For smoking status in the foreign
women, the R? change and partial 7* are
the same, 3.3 per cent. Apparently, smoking exerts an independent effect on the
birth weight in this group. Still other variables such as gestation at delivery and prepregnant weight show a larger value for
unique variance than for R? change. Obviously, relationships among the variables
in this study are exceedingly complex.

added 8.2 per cent variance to the equation among the foreign born, but only 2.6
per cent and 1.6 per cent for New York
and southern women. Even biological risk
factors contribute differently among the
groups, adding 11.5 per cent among the
foreign-born contrasted with 5.4 per cent
among the New York cohort and 4.2 per
cent among the southern women.

Table 3 lists those factors within each

variable set which add more than 1 per
cent variance to the equation at the time
they were entered. While there is some
overlap across groups, there are many variables which make a contribution of this
size in only one nativity group. For example, planning the pregnancy appears to
contribute only in the foreign-born group.

ble. The decision to enter it as one of the
variables in the last set was based on the
observation that in all groups, the zero order correlations with a number of social
and behavioral variables were around
0.10. If these factors did indeed contribute
to the variance in gestation, then controlling for gestation would decrease the contribution of the social factors to birth
weight.

Gestation at delivery added 16.8 per
cent variance to the birth weight regression for the New York City cohort, 26.8
per cent for the southern group, but only
6.9 per cent for the foreign women. This
means that the amount of total variance

accounted for by all the other variables before gestation 1s entered as a predictor is
only 18.6 per cent for New York, 14.0 per
cent for the south, but a large 30.3 per cent
for the foreign group.

This difference suggests two possible
explanations:

1. Social factors may contribute substantially to gestation at delivery among the foreign-born women but not in the other two
groups.

2. A major difference between the foreign cohort and the other two is that the foreign women are relatively more homogeneous for birth weight due to rarity of low
birth weight in this group. Gestation may be
expected to contribute relatively less variDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

accounted for 18.2 per cent more of the
variance in gestation for foreign women
than for the New York City women, and
15.6 per cent more than for the southern
cohort. In the foreign group, the variable
set making the largest addition to R? was
current social factors (14.4 per cent). Outside of the control set, subject’s education
and recruitment category are the two
largest contributors. Subject’s education
adds 8.5 per cent variance, and recruitment category adds 3.6 per cent. Recruitment category was also important in the
New York City cohort. It was the only varlable which added 1 per cent variance for
this group. Size of town in which the women grew up and welfare status were the
important factors for the southern group.

BIRTH WEIGHT AND GESTATION
REGRESSIONS: SUBSAMPLE OF BIRTHS OVER
2,500 GRAMS

Analysis of only those births over 2,500
grams should make the New York City
and southern cohorts more homogeneous
for birth weight and gestation and thus
more similar to the foreign group. As can
be observed in Table 6, both mean birth
weights and standard deviations are more
similar for the three cohorts. For gestation, however, while standard deviations
are reduced from those of the total births,

similar differences remain between groups
for both mean gestation and variability of
gestation.

The regression analysis for birth weight
using only births over 2,500 grams shows
major differences in the amount of variance explained by the five variable sets,
with 19 per cent and 21 per cent respectively in New York City and southern
births and a high of 47 per cent for the foreign cohorts (Table 7). For all groups, as
may be expected, the treatment and mediating factors contributed a smaller R?
change than in the analysis on the total
sample. For the New York City and foreign groups social factors (childhood and
current) both showed a greater effect than
in the analysis on the total sample, but
there was essentially no difference in the
R’ change for this set in the southern
group. Health behaviors and biological
risk factors continue to be stronger contributors to birth weight variance for the
foreign-born than for the other groups.
The specific variables in each set contributing more than 1 per cent variance are
shown in Table 8. Five of the eight variables in the Current Social Factors set and
both variables in the Childhood set have

tor for the New York City and southern
cohorts.

For the births over 2,500 grams, a total
of 15.8 per cent of variance in gestation is
explained by the variable sets for the New
York cohort (Table 9). This is 9.8 per cent
more than that for the comparable analysis using total birth weight range in the
New York group. For the southern cohort, only 11.8 per cent of the variance in
gestation is explained in this current analysis, representing an increase of only 3.3
per cent over the analysis for the total
births. The change for the foreign-born

cohort, at 5.7 per cent, is greater than
might be expected, since they are primarily a group with birth weights over 2,500
grams initially. The change in prediction
for the New York City group is contributed by the social factors, health behaviors, and risk factors. Contrasting the variance added by each set in this analysis,
childhood factors here add 1.7 per cent
more when entered, current social factors
2.9 per cent more, health behaviors about
1 per cent, and risk factors 3.8 per cent
more. |

Whereas in the total group regression on
gestation, the current social factor set
added twice as much variance as any of the
other sets, in this regression, childhood
and current factors add equal variance and
the treatment and mediating set adds 3 per
cent contrasted with 0.9 per cent previously. A similar pattern emerges for the
foreign cohort.

Within the variable sets, four of the
same factors are adding more than 1 per
cent variance for the foreign-born cohort
(Table 10), while several factors are new.
Father’s occupation, triceps and average
weight gain, husband’s occupation and
subject’s occupation have dropped out.
For the southern cohort, the variance
added by town size stays the same, while
age, marital status, and complement now
add at least 1 per cent variance. New York

It is expected that the improved prediction of gestation by the social and biological variables in the over 2,500 gram groups
should be reflected as a decreased contribution of gestation to the prediction of
birth weight. Indeed, this is what is observed. If we compare the R? values from
Table 2 to those in Table 7, we see that the
change in birth weight variance contributed by the addition of the fifth variable
set containing gestation is reduced from
20.8 per cent to 5.0 per cent in the New
York City cohort, from 30.5 per cent to
10.2 per cent in the southern cohort, and
from 9.9 per cent to 3.2 per cent in the foreign-born cohort.

The cumulative R? for each successive
variable set up to risk factors is similar
for the total and over 2,500 gram analyses
for the New York City and southern cohorts, reaching an R? of 14 per cent in the
New York cohort for both analyses and 10
per cent and 11 per. cent respectively for
the southern cohort. The values for the

DISCUSSION

As hypothesized, the relative contribution of links in the causal chain do vary by
nativity cohort. Overall, results of the
birth weight regression for all births
showed not only different variables within
sets adding variance to the regression, but
perhaps more importantly, showed
different sets adding the most variance.
Particularly striking in the birth weight regression on the total group (Table 11) is
that the proportion of total variance
added by the five variable sets differs considerably for the three cohorts when the
effect of gestation is removed from the last
set. These five variable sets predict from a
low of 14 per cent of the variance in the
southern group to a high of 30.3 per cent
for the foreign group. The amount of variance added by gestation (6.9 per cent foreign to 26.8 per cent southern) is inverse
to that resulting from the remaining variables. Thus, the total variance explained is
similar for the three groups.

The same regression on births over

2,500 grams serves to decrease the variance accounted for by gestation, but essentially does not change the total accounted for by social factors, except in the
foreign-born group. Apparently, in all
three groups, the decreased variance
added by gestation in the over 2,500 gram
analysis results in part from better prediction of gestation by the other factors
(Table 12). The decreased variance in gestation in this limited birth weight range is
probably a factor as well. The truncation
of the study population on the biological
variables has probably contributed to the
low correlation of these variables with the
social variables. Further, the limited variance on social variables in the New York
City and southern cohorts could be expected to weaken the chance of finding relationships to birth weight. In fact, the
lack of clear linear relationships in these
groups may well be related to this situation and probably affect the patterns of
variables associated in the regression analysis.

Our first paper presented a schematic
diagram of the hypothesized relationships
of the variable sets used in this study. The
findings of the current study suggest a revised model of these relationships. The

model representing relationships seen in
this study are shown in Figure 1.

Biological indices of early nutrition
(height) and nutrition at conception (triceps and prepregnant weight) show almost no association with childhood social
status and a relatively weak association
with current socioeconomic status in this
study population. This lack of association
contrasts with most reports in the literature and is likely related to the truncated
distribution of these biological factors in
the study sample. That associations of social class with the biological indices of nutritional status were stronger in the foreign-born cohort, which had wider
variation in social class and less truncation
on biological variables, suggests that in a
more normally distributed group relationships commensurate with those reported
in the literature would exist. The biological indices do show a direct association
with birth weight. This might be expected
since the women were selected on these
factors to be at high risk of low birth
weight.

In this population, as in the Aberdeen
studies (Baird, 1954; Illsley, 1955), and a
study by Drillien (1957), childhood social
status is associated with current socioeconomic status, although the association here is less strong. This is probably

due in part to the problems of measuring
childhood status in this study. The more
traditional index, father’s occupation, is
weak because a large percentage of women did not know their father’s occupation. Also father’s occupation in this study
did not reflect well the educational aspects
of social class in the native-born cohorts.
In these groups, the jobs held by fathers
were often not commensurate with man’s
educational attainment. Knowing or not
knowing one’s father’s occupation appears to be important. Mother’s occupation is no more useful a measure than
father’s occupation since a high proportion of women were housewives. Despite
these problems, some association does exist between the two variable sets, childhood and current socioeconomic status.
Childhood socioeconomic status is also
associated with health behaviors. In the
two native-born cohorts, childhood status
seems to relate to different health behaviors than does current status. More overlap is observed for the foreign cohort.
Childhood factors, current social status,
and health behaviors all appear to relate
to weight gain and gestation. Childhood
social status, in particular the variable representing knowledge of father’s occupation, shows a unique contribution to variance in birth weight only in the New York

City group. It must be noted that in this
group, current and childhood status are
essentially measuring the same aspects of
life since a large proportion of the group is
young and still lives with a parent. The
effects of the available childhood indices
seem to operate more through the current
status and health behaviors for the other
two cohorts.

The relative importance of the variable
sets to birth weight appears to be different
for the foreign-born group when contrasted with the New York City and
southern cohorts (see Table 11). Since the
foreign cohort represents a different,
higher childhood social class background,
but is similar to the other groups in current
social status, the differing associations of
the variable sets to birth weight may be related to childhood socioeconomic status.
In the foreign-born group, biological risk
factors add the largest amount of variance
to the regression equation for birth
weight, followed by health behaviors, gestation, and current socioeconomic status.
In the regression on birth weight for the
other two cohorts, gestation makes the
biggest contribution, followed by risk factors, current social status, and the remainder of the treatment and mediating factors
set. Health behaviors add the least variance to the regression for these groups.
Even so, health behaviors make a unique
contribution to birth weight above and beyond their contribution through the mediating variables, particularly in the foreign-born cohort. Further, much of the
association of childhood and current socloeconomic status with birth weight
seems to operate through health behaviors. This would seem to have important
implications for prevention.

Since effects of health behaviors are
strongest in the foreign-born cohort and
the foreign-born group is more representative of a general population than are the

 

Social Biology

other cohorts, the results in a similar study
on a more general population sample may
be expected to more closely resemble the
results for the foreign cohort. If so, there
is an element of optimism to these findings, for unlike some of the other variables
in this study, health behaviors are accessible to modification. Such modification
theoretically could be accomplished
within the existing structure of current
public health resources.

Since this is the first study using
multivariate techniques to examine simultaneously the spectrum of social and
biological factors associated with birth
weight and the interrelationships of the
variable sets to each other as well as to
birth weight in populations with differing
childhood social backgrounds, future research is needed to replicate these findings
in a more general population and with
more valid measures of social class. Future studies should have a larger sample
size, include blacks and whites, have wider social class variation in the study population, and avoid the truncation of the
biological indices of nutrition. It would
also be useful to determine specifically
when and how health behaviors are
learned and when during the life cycle intervention attempts may be most
effective.
