The Fertility of Sterile and Subfecund

Women in New Orleans

Carl L. Harter

Department of Sociology and Urban Studies Center
Tulane University
New Orleans, Louisiana

During the last quarter-century several
social demographic studies of “American”
fertility have concluded that almost onethird of the married white women (couples)
of reproductive age are not totally fecund.
For example, 27% of the white Protestant
couples married 12-14 years that were interviewed in the Indianapolis Study were
said to be “relatively sterile’ (Whelpton
and Kiser, 1950, p. 329), In the first and
second Growth of American Families (GAF)
studies (Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell, 1959, p. 26; Whelpton, Campbell, and
Patterson, 1966, p. 133), 34 and 31%, respectively, of white couples with wives age
18-39 were classified as subfecund. Finally,
as indicated by the data to be reported
here, 33% of a probability sample of evermarried and/or ever-pregnant white women
age 15-44 interviewed in New Orleans in
1965 were classified as either sterile or subfecund.

The criteria used to establish a couple’s
fecundity status have varied somewhat from
study to study. Nevertheless, ample evidence
of the extent of fecundity impairments is
provided by the regularity with which some
one-third of reproductive-age couples, at a
point in time and on the basis of survey
data, are classified as being less than fecund,

 

However, this simply indicates the extent
of fecundity impairments; it does not indicate the effect of fecundity impairments
on fertility. This distinction between extent
and effect is not often made, but it is a
distinction that is important to the student
of fertility.

There is a tendency for many people,
Including some demographers and health
professionals, to equate fecundity impairments of any type with childlessness or, at
best, meager fertility. Further, upon reading
that “millions of American couples are
unable to have children at a normal rate,”
or that “in the United States about 6
million white couples with wife aged 18-39
are limited in their ability to have children”
(Freedman et al., 1959, p. 17-18), the tendency is to assume that the fertility rate
in the United States would be much higher
than it now Js if one-third of the reproductive-age couples were not sterile or subfecund. According to the GAF authors, however, the fact of the matter is that ‘“fecundity impairments have a minor effect on
birth rates in the United States. The major
force keeping American families relatively
small is contraception rather than subfecundity” (Freedman et al., 1959, p. 55).

Even though about one-third of the mar

ried women (couples) of childbearing age
may have some type of fecundity impairment, many of these women are nonetheless
having children. What, then, is the fertility
of sterile and subfecund women?!

CATEGORIES OF STERILITY
AND SUBFECUNDITY

The sterility and subfecundity categories
established here are meant to be of demographic, not medical, usefulness. Basic categorizations of the numerous types of infertility is the rightful domain of the gynecologist, the urologist, the endocrinologist,
the semenologist, or the psychiatrist.? Nevertheless, and for obvious reasons, demographers have found it necessary to be concerned with fecundity impairments,

For the social demographer, categories
of fecundity impairments need to encompass
the origin and general nature of the impairment as well as the relationship between
present family size and desired fertility.
Both sterility (the inability to bear any or
any more children) and subfecundity (the
inability to bear children at a “normal”
rate) may have either medical-physical or
social origins; hence both may be either involuntary or voluntary in nature. Examples
of sterility of medical-physical origins are
hysterectomies required for the benefit of
the health of a woman, organic malformations within the reproductive system, and
dehabilitating accidents to any part of the
reproductive system. On the other hand,
sterility may be viewed as having a social
origin when a woman chooses to have a

1 In one sense the discussion to follow is an analysis of the fertility and fecundity status of couples,
and not just of women, Nevertheless, males were
only of minor importance in determining whether a
union was to be classified as sterile, subfecund, or
fecund. For example, over 90% of the sterile classifications were due to female sterility. Further, the
fertility data to be presented represent the actual

fertility experience of the women. Hereafter, the
joint reference to couples will not be made.

research on infertility is available in the March 1965
issue of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology and in the
official journal of the American Fertility Society,

tubal ligation or a man, a vasectomy. The
first type of sterility may occur before or
after a desired family size has been achieved,
but the second type will usually only occur
after the achievement of a desired family
size. In the analysis to follow, data are
presented for the following three sterility
categories,

1. Sterile never pregnant (SNP). Included in
this category are women with organic defects which make an initial conception impossible, women who have had (for whatever reasons) sterilization operations before having ever experienced conception,
and women who have lived in an uncontracepted marital union for seven or more
years but have not had an initial conception.

2. Sterile before completing desired fertility
(SB). The women in this category have
all had conceptions, but the subsequent
advent of sterility, whether required for
medical reasons or caused by illness or an
accident, prohibited them from reaching a
desired family size. Since more children
are desired, these women can be classified
as being involuntarily sterile.

3. Sterile after completing desired fertility (SA).
This category includes women who are
sterile, but who already have a present
family size that is equal to, or larger than,
their desired family size. It would have
been desirable to establish two SA categories—one for women who became sterile
involuntarily and one for women who
voluntarily had a sterilization operation—
but information of this type was not collected in the survey which provided the
data reported here. Therefore, the SA
category used here includes cases of both
voluntary and involuntary sterility.

The identification and classification of
sterile women is usually much easier for
both the medical and social researcher than
is the identification and classification of subfecund women. Nonetheless, for purposes
of this social demographic discussion, subfecundity, just like sterility, can be viewed
as having either medical-physical or social
origins. Endometriosis, ovarian dysfunction,
hormone deficiences, retroversion of the
uterus, low sperm count, or poor sperm
motility are just a few of the causes of subfecundity having a medical-physical origin.

Subfecundity having a social origin is

 
 

Vol. 17, No. 3

not as divorced from medical-physical indications as is sterility having a social
origin. Voluntary subfecundity, and hence
“social” in the sense that a choice is involved, is usually stimulated by medicalphysical indications. For example, a woman
may choose not to become pregnant again
because of the possibility of complications
in delivery, the possibility of producing a
mentally or physically deformed child, or
the possibility of not being able to produce
ina viable product of conception. In such

over any period of at least two years,
failed to conceive while trying to become
pregnant. Although in many cases the
cause is not known, apparently this type
of subfecundity is medical-physical or
psychogenic in origin. Women in this category are not contraceptors, with the possible exception of a few in the immediate
premenopausal years who, even though

2. Complications in delivery or in carrying to

may have a wide variety of conditions, including a history of two or more miscarriages or stillbirths, Rh negative blood
factor, or two or more caesarian deliveries.
Even though a desired family size has not

yet been achieved, most of these women
are using some method of family planning
because they are fearful of a deleterious
outcome of a future pregnancy.

SAMPLE

This report is based on data obtained in
a survey conducted in metropolitan New
Orleans in 1965 which utilized a probability
sample of ever-married persons and everpregnant women between the ages of 15
and 45, plus men over age 44 currently
married to or living with women under age
45. For selection of the sample a partial
social-area analysis was done on the census
tracts in the New Orleans Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area and a proportionate
number of occupied housing units were
selected from each of the eight social areas
established.®

On the basis of 1960 census data, it was
estimated that 50% of the homes in a
probability sample would not contain anyone meeting the above eligibility requirements and that the remaining one-half of
the homes would contain an average of two
eligibles each. Interviewers were able to
determine the eligibility status of occupants
in all but 3% of the 1,124 housing units included in the sample. Of the 1,090 homes
where eligibility status of occupants was determined, 51% contained no eligibles and
the remaining 49% contained an average
of 1.9 eligibles.

The sex-race distribution of the 1,021
eligibles identified is as follows: 401 white
females, 375 white males, 144 nonwhite females, and 101 nonwhite males. Female interviewers obtained completed interviews
from 99% of both white and nonwhite females, This report is based on information
provided by these 540 ever-married and/or
ever-pregnant women age 15 to 45.4

RESULTS

As a prelude to discussing the fertility
of these 540 women, two points bear reiteration. Even though at any point in time
almost one-third of reproductive-age married women may have some type of fecundity impairments, it has been suggested
that this plays a minor role in determining

subclassifications of women with impaired

be demographically useful, are suggested as
prototypes and no claim is made as to
their finality. Where larger samples are

fertility rates. If this is true, then despite
their impaired fecundity, sterile and subfecund women are nevertheless making a
substantial contribution to the numerator
as well as to the denominator of fertility
rates. The primary purpose of this report,
therefore, is to present data on the fertility
of sterile and subfecund women.

In order to indicate that there are great
differences in fertility among women with
fecundity impairments, and hence to sug
available, it is conceivable that more than
five categories might be useful.

DISTRIBUTION BY FECUNDITY STATUS

The distribution of this probability sample of 540 ever-married and/or ever-pregnant women by fecundity status within
race and groupings by number of years
lived in a marital union is presented in
Table 1. Only 2.5% of the whites and 0.7%
of the nonwhites were classified as “sterile

 
Vol. 17, No. 3

never pregnant” (hereafter SNP). With respect to number of years lived in a marital
union,® the highest percentage of SNP’s is
in the group married 5 to 9 years (3.8% of
the whites and 3.2% of the nonwhites).
A lower percentage of SNP’s was observed for women married ten years or
more. This suggests that some of the SNP
women married less than ten years will
eventually conceive. At any rate, of the
women married ten years or more, all of
i, the nonwhites and all but 2.4% of the
© whites had experienced conception. The in‘ability to have an initial conception is,
‘S therefore, a relatively rare phenomenon.
2 The onset of sterility before completing
A desired fertility (hereafter SB) is somewhat
more common than the incidence of SNP.
© Ten per cent of the whites and 4.2% of the
‘Ononwhites were classified as SB. As ex3 pected, this type of sterility increases with
‘S length of time lived in a marital union. In
faddition, among women married ten years
.2or more, proportionately more whites than
nonwhites are SB. Barring any intrinsic
racial differences, what accounts for the
Z fact that of women married ten years or
more 15.5% of the whites, but only 7.6%
3 of the nonwhites, were classified as SB? One
reason is that the nonwhite woman, on the
average, has a smaller desired family size
but has had more pregnancies than the
S average white woman. Hence, the nonE white woman reaches her desired family
A size earlier in life than does the average
white woman, By virtue of these fertility
differences, by the time the nonwhite woman has a medically prescribed sterilization
operation or “accidentally” becomes sterile
she is more likely to have already achieved
a desired family size than is the white woman. Consequently, if we assume that all
SB’s are cases of “involuntary” sterility,
the racial difference in the proportion of

SB’s could simply be a reflection of racial
differences in age-specific fertility. But this
does not seem to be the case because in
most instances both white and nonwhite
women, in the absence of involuntary sterility, have achieved a desired family size before completing 15 years of married life.
Yet among women married 15 years or
more, 19% of the whites and only 7.9%
of the nonwhites are SB’s. Thus, in the
absence of any intrinsic racial differences
promoting differential sterility, some factor(s) other than racial differences in fertility must account for the racial difference
in the proportion of SB’s.

Although specific data on the subject
were not obtained in this study, the explanation of this phenomenon of racial differences
in sterility seems to be differential health
care, both in the utilization of health services and in the type of medical service
received. A majority of the nonwhites in
New Orleans receive their health and
medical services from public agencies; for
example, 74% of the nonwhite births in
New Orleans in 1966 occurred in Charity
Hospital of Louisiana at New Orleans,
while only 6% of the white births occurred
in this hospital (Louisiana State Board of
Health, 1966, p. 19). Medical personnel indicate that a postpartum sterilization operation in Charity Hospital is performed only
if it is absolutely required by the medical
indications. Further, nonpostpartum sterilization operations are a rarity in this hospital because they are rarely required for
medical reasons.

The majority of whites, on the other
hand, receive their health and medical
services from private sources. Medically required sterilization operations, or course,
are performed for private patients (nonCharity Hospital patients). But, in addition, private patients have the possibility
of receiving sterilization operations that
are not medically required. For example,
regardless of whether or not the patient is
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:53 08 December 2015

200 Harter

postpartum, a private physician may point
out to a patient possible future health
complications if she should become pregnant again. On this basis the physician may
suggest—or the patient may request—a
“not absolutely required but medically indicated” sterilization operation. This point
receives some substantiation from the fact
that none of the SB nonwhites, but 22.5%
of the SB whites, had tubal ligations, an
operation which is usually not a medically
required operation,

A further reason for the greater incidence
of SB’s among the whites than among the
nonwhites is that indigent patients with
nonacute health problems, for whom a
sterilization operation might be medically
prescribed, do not as readily seek health
care as do private (nonindigent) patients.

Similar to the case for the SB’s, there is a
positive correlation in both races between
length of time lived in a marital union and
the proportion of women who became sterile
after achieving a desired family size (hereafter SA). Also, there is a greater proportion
of SA’s among the whites (11.8%) than
among the nonwhites (7%). Again, the racial difference is probably largely due to differences in the type of health services received, rather than attributable to any intrinsic racial difference.

The data reported above, when taken
as a general summary statement about the
extent of sterility, indicate a strong, positive

relationship in each race between the pro
portion of sterile women and the number of
years lived in a marital union. Even though
this linear relationship is found in both
races, the proportion of whites classified as
sterile (24.4%) is double that of the nonwhites (12.0%). However, large racial differences in the proportion of women classified as sterile are evident only among women
who have experienced at least ten years of
marriage.

With respect to the proportion of women
classified as subfecund, there appears to be

Social Biology

no major difference between the two races or
between the years-lived-in-a-marital-union
categories. Five per cent of the whites and
7% of the nonwhites indicated that they had
had difficulty in conceiving (hereafter DC),
while only 3.3% and 1.4%, respectively,
gave evidence of having had serious complications in delivery or in carrying a product
of conception to term (hereafter CDCT).
Consequently, in this sample 8.3% of the
whites and 8.4% of the nonwhites were classified as subfecund.

The proportion of fecund women in each
of the years-lived-in-a-marital-union categories is shown in the last line of each half of
Table 1. About 90% of the women married
less than five years indicated they had no
fecundity impairment, On the other hand,
of the reproductive-age women married 15
years or more, only about one-half of the
whites and two-thirds of the nonwhites were
still capable, if they so desired, of having a
relatively uncomplicated birth in due course.
In short, in the total sample, one-third of the
whites and one-fifth of the nonwhites are
sterile or subfecund.

As the data in the upper half of Table 2
indicate, there is not a significant difference
in the distribution of sterile, subfecund, and
fecund white women between the lower class
and middle class (x? = 1.290).® The highest
incidence of sterility and subfecundity
among the white women is in the lower class,
where 39.3% were classified as sterile or subfecund; in the middle class, 33.2% were so
classified. Similarly, since 28.4% of the
upper-class women were classified as sterile
or subfecund, there is likewise not a significant difference in the distribution of
sterile, subfecund, and fecund white women
between either the lower class and upper
class (x? = 2.447) or between the middle
class and upper class (x? = 0.784). All but

6 Social class indices were computed on the basis
of the scoring system established in U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1963. Scores of 0-39, 40-79, and 80-99

were arbitrarily used to designate the lower, middle,
and upper classes respectively.

two of the nonwhite cases were in the lower
or middle class, and there was no significant
difference in the distribution of sterile, subfecund, and fecund women between these
two groups (x? = 0.675).

In short, there seems to be some 5 to 10%
less sterility and subfecundity in the upper
class, at least among whites, than there is in
the other two social classes, This seems to

of sterile women among Protestants than’
among Catholics? Some people argue that
there is (or should be) because Catholics
tend to refrain from having voluntary sterilization operations. In New Orleans, at least,
this does not seem to be the case (see Table
3). Among the white women, 25.4% of the
Protestants and 23.7% of the Catholics
were classified as sterile. The percentages

belie the argument that the relative number
of sterilization operations increases with
social-status ranking because this method
of fertility control is much easier than the
continual practice of contraception, it is
“the thing to do,” and it is within the realm
of financial possibility. In fact among the
whites there tends to be an inverse relationship between social class and both sterility
and subfecundity.

Ts there likely to be a greater proportion

among the nonwhites are 10.4 for the Protestants and 13.6 for the Catholics. On the
whole, about one-third of both Protestant
and Catholic white women were classified as
sterile or subfecund, and about one-fifth of
the nonwhite women of each religion were
so classified.

ity to date or upon future fertility demands
that some attention be given to desired
family size. It could be argued, for example,
that because they cannot have (more) children or will have difficulty in having (more)
children, sterile or subfecund women either
minimize the effect of their impairment by
saying that they really wanted no or few
children, or exaggerate it by saying they
really wanted a large family. To obtain some
insight into this matter, all of our 540 women were asked to indicate how many children
they now thought was the best number for

Since the nonwhite subgroup samples are
so small, conclusions are not in order. Nevertheless, the indication is that on the average,
subfecund and fecund nonwhite women desire about the same size family (the respective means being 2.36 and 2.28 ), while sterile
nonwhite women desired a family that is one
and one-fourth of a child larger (4 = 3.59)
than that desired by the subfecund or the
fecund women.

Turning now to the fertility experience of
this probability sample of reproductive-age
women, the data in Table 5 indicate very
little difference in any of the duration-of

were received from 530 women, and these
data are presented in Table 4. The first obvious conclusion about desired fertility and
fecundity status is that among the whites
in each number-of-years-lived-in-a-maritalunion category there is virtually no difference in the size of family now thought best
between the sterile and subfecund group and
the fecund group. On the average, the sterile
and subfecund women want 3.18 children,
while the fecund women want 3.19 children.
There is a tendency, however, for the sterile
women to want more children (# = 3.30)
than the fecund women, while subfecund
women want fewer children (4 = 2.85) than
fecund women,

 

marriage groupings in the mean number of
pregnancies experienced by sterile white
women and the mean number of pregnancies
experienced by fecund white women. In the
“Total” column, however, we find that
sterile white women have had an average of
3.66 pregnancies, while fecund white women
have had an average of only 3.02 pregnancies. However, the total means should
not be compared because both parity and
the incidence of sterility increase with duration of marriage. But even if only those
white women who have lived at least ten
years in a marital union are considered, the
SB’s have had one pregnancy less (# =
3.00) than the fecund group (% = 3.96),

while the SA’s have had one pregnancy more
(% = 5.10) than the fecund group. Leaving
aside the 2.5% in the SNP category, the
important points here are (1) that reproductive-age white women married ten years or
more who are currently sterile, and who became sterile before completing desired fertility, nevertheless had an average of three
pregnancies before becoming sterile and (2)
that reproductive-age white women married
ten years or more who are currently sterile,
and who became sterile after completing desired fertility, had an average of five pregnancies before becoming sterile.

The conclusion is obvious. Of a probability sample of reproductive-age ever-married

Sterile and Subfecund Women

203

white women it is likely that one-fourth will
be sterile; nevertheless, most of these sterile
women will have experienced substantial
fertility prior to the onset of their sterility.

With respect to the fertility of the subfecund whites, as would be expected, the
DC’s tend to have fewer pregnancies and the
CDCT’s tend to have more pregnancies than
do those who are fecund. The DC white
women who have lived in a marital union at
least ten years have had an average of 2.07
pregnancies, the fecund ones have had an
average of 3.96 pregnancies, and the CDCT’s
an average of 4.38 pregnancies. Thus, even
though subfecund white women who have
been married at least ten years may have

at least ten years had an average of 1.60
pregnancies prior to the onset of sterility;
their fecund counterparts have had an average of 6.00 pregnancies, and their SA counterparts had an average of 7.25 pregnancies
prior to the onset of sterility.

Although the onset of sterility prior to
achieving desired family size appears to curtail fertility to a greater extent among the
nonwhites than among the whites, sterile

whites and 12% of the nonwhites became
sterile after completing desired fertility.
These women had had, respectively, 5.10
pregnancies and 7.25 pregnancies by that
time. Therefore, even though one-fifth and
one-third, respectively, of nonwhite and
white reproductive-age women with at

One of the problems with using number

sumably, women use their present family
size as a basis for deciding whether or not
to have additional children. Data on the
number of living children in the respondent’s
family at the time of the interview are presented in Table 6. This measure of present
family size includes older children permanently living away from home and any
younger children temporarily living elsewhere, as well as the children currently liv
whites, there are four step-, two adopted,
and no foster children. Thus, almost all of
the children in the families of these sterile
and subfecund women are their own offspring.

A few statements about the data in
Table 6 will suffice as a conclusion to this
brief report on the fertility of sterile and
subfecund women. The main point, however, and one that is perhaps unbelievable

to some people, is that in this probability
sample of 398 ever-married and/or everpregnant white women age 15-44, the 33%
who are Sterile or subfecund have just as
many children in their families at present
(% = 2.54) as do the 67% who are fecund

nonwhites, the 20% who are sterile or subfecund have an average of 2.38 children in

their families at the present time. Although
infertility may be a serious problem for a
small minority of “sterile and subfecund”
women, it is apparent from these data that,
prior to or in spite of their fecundity impairment, many “sterile and subfecund”
women have been able to achieve a family
size in the two to four children range. Thus,

are fecund have an average of 3.32 children.

When the mean present family sizes are
considered only for those women who have
lived in a marital union at least ten years,
the conclusions are still striking as shown in
Table 7. These data indicate that 43% of
the white women and 29% of the nonwhite
women who have lived in a marital union
for ten years or more are now sterile or subfecund; yet they have an average of 2.74
children and 2.95 children, respectively, in

as one-third of the reproductive-age married women may be classified as sterile or
subfecund, they have already contributed
their “fair share” to the overall fertility
rate of American women.
