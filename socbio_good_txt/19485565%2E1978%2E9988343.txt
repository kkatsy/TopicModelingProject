Violence Among Delinquents by Family

Intactness and Size

ABSTRACT: This effort to locate correlates of violent crime found that the most violent delinquents
were males from Jarge intact families. Although males were generally much more violent than
females, this was not true among small intact families where violence was low and equal for males

and females.

The prediction of violence has been a
difficult task (Glaser et al., 1966). As a
result, rather than attempting longitudinal
predictive studies, most researchers have
focused upon identifying correlates of violent behavior. In this way, several
violence-related variables have been identified. According to Palmer (1973, pp.
16-17), the foremost variable is maleness;
the second is youth. Males in their late
teens to early twenties compose the vast
majority of the population of violent offenders. Both the incidence of delinquency
and its more violent expressions have also
been related to socioeconomic, geographic, ethnocultural, situational, and family
variables. Family variables long prominent in explaining delinquency include the
broken family, poor supervision and discipline, and lack of love from the youngster’s parents (McCord et al., 1959).

The present study examined two family
variables—broken families and large
families—within a sample of delinquents
in order to test their association with violent crimes.

BACKGROUND
BROKEN FAMILIES

Perhaps because “love” is still somewhat difficult to measure, and the “broken
family” fairly easy, more research has concentrated on the effects of father-absence
than on the more subtle variable of the
quality of the father’s presence. Fatherabsence, usually associated with broken
families, has long been associated with delinquency, despite evidence that there may
well be no relationship between the two
(e.g., Burgess and Price, 1963, p. 184,
cited in Herzog, 1973, p. 48; Linder et al.,
1974).

Further, a recent study (Andrew, 1976)
found that, broken homes in themselves
related to the incidence of delinquency for
female delinquents only. Since females
constitute only a small portion of the delinquent population, this finding suggests
that the effect of broken families on delinquency may be minimal. When we turn
from considering the incidence of delinquency toward examining the violence of
delinquency, the larger number of males
becomes even more prominent (Andrew,
1974a). Therefore, the effect of broken
homes on the overall violence level within

243

244

the population might be expected to be
even more minimal.

Some authorities have found that the
intact family may, under some circumstances, produce more violence than the
broken family. Intact families may display
a “cohesive familism” (Linder et al., 1974)
and an emotional intensity that can precipitate violence (Gorney, 1975). The large
intact family may encourage stereotyped

sex roles (Eagly and Anderson, 1974) and —

perhaps evoke the historical stereotype of
the violent American male. Also, in terms
of modeling influences, having a pathological father may be more damaging than
having no father at all (Robins et al., 1975)
or than having a stepfather (Lessing et al.,
1970).

However, in contrast to the above studies, two studies have linked father-absence
to violence among delinquents (Chilton
and Markle, 1972; Toby, 1966). The relation between broken families and violence
is thus still unclear.

FAMILY SIZE

This second family variable is as easy to
measure as are broken homes, and the
data also seem contradictory. A review by
Thompson (1974) and a survey by Linn
(1973) suggest that the public still, to a
great extent, glamorizes large families and
stigmatizes small families, and especially
“only children,” viewing such children as
maladjusted, “spoiled,” and generally deviant. Yet large families produce more delinquents than smaller families (Andrew,
1976; Breckinridge and Abbott, 1912;
Burns and Stern, 1967, p. 391; Wolkind,
1974).

The large-family effect has been associated with the incidence of delinquency
among males (Andrew, 1976: Bandura
and Walters, 1959; Bennett, 1960; Breckinridge and Abbott, 1912; Burns and
Stern, 1967; Wolkind, 1974). It is easier to
find reasons why large families may create

Andrew

_ Social Biology

delinquency in general than to find reasons
for a specific effect on males. It may be
speculated that males may be more vulnerable than females to those influences
that seem to incline to delinquency.

Children from large families have lower
IQ’s than those from small families (Anastasi, 1956; Belmont and Marolla, 1973)
and poorer verbal ability in particular
(Kellaghan and McNamara, 1972), which
in turn has been linked to delinquency
(Andrew, 19746,c).

Secondly, motivations for producing
large families may involve “instrumental
values” (Rabin and Greene, 1968;
Thompson, 1974), perhaps a disinclination
toward care in contraception (Meleis,
1971) or a need to “act out” traditional
family values. Such motivations may lead
in some cases to a devaluing of the individual child which may lead to brutal or
subtle neglect. One evidence of such neglect may be the poorer nutrition which,
surprisingly enough, has been found in
children from large intact families but not
in those from small broken families (Cook,
et al., 1973).

Thirdly, the large family may impose
density, which in itself may produce stress
(Loo, 1973; Newman and Pollack, 1973;
Rodgers, 1972). Crowded surroundings
may also increase noise levels which may
make verbal learning difficult. By this
route, that is, by decreasing verbal skills,
crowding may increase acting-out (Andrew, 1974b,c).

The above studies again refer only to
the incidence of delinquency, not of violence. Recently, violence too, at least
among male delinquents in Germany, has
been found more often among those from
Jarge families than from small ones
(Schindler, 1975).

ETHNICITY

It was considered important for several
reasons to examine different ethnic groups
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 25, No. 3

separately to determine whether findings
would be consistent across ethnic groupings. First, ethnicity may relate to family
size (Andrew, 1976). In violence studies,
ethnicity is usually mentioned as a variable, together with disclaimers suggesting
that other variables, such as family variables, may be responsible (Glaser et al.,
1966; Palmer, 1973). Further, three of the
cited studies (Cook et al., 1973; Linder et
al., 1974; Schindler, 1975) were conducted
in non-American cultures (England,
Canada, and Germany, respectively). It
would he of great interest if ethnic differences were found; and, if none were found,
this would contribute to generality.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study hypothesized that violence
among a group of delinquents on probation would be greater (a) for males than
females, (b) for those from broken families
vs. intact families, and (c) for those from
large families vs. small families. It was
also expected that these trends would be
consistent across ethnic groups.

SUBJECTS

Subjects were 214 delinquents, aged
12-20, referred consecutively by probation
officers for psychological evaluation to aid
in treatment planning. They were predominately of lower socioeconomic class.

All probationers had been assigned to
San Diego’s experimental probation program which features intensive supervision
and availability of psychological consultation in lieu of incarceration. Data were
retrieved from psychology files.

VIOLENCE MEASURE

“Violence” was defined as the likelihood
of causing bodily harm to another, and
secondarily, nonbodily harm. The measure of violence shown in Table 1 was the
Violence Scale (Andrew, 1974a) which
provides numerical values for each crime,

Violence Among Delinquents

245

ranging from 1.00, smoking by a minor, to
56.00, voluntary manslaughter. The Violence Scale represents the averaged judgment of four professionals in probation as
to the probability of a given crime resulting in harm to another. Rap sheets were
examined, and the numerical value was

- read from the Violence Scale for each de
linquent’s most serious crime. For instance, if a youngster had been charged
with an assault (score, 48.50), and a petty
theft (score, 25.50), then his or her score
would be 48.50. The average score of the
present sample, 36.81, would correspond
approximately to 37.00, burglary.

STATISTICAL TREATMENT

An analysis of variance was to be performed within ethnic categories, using as
independent variables the sex of the delinquent, the broken/intact family variable,
and the family size. The dependent variable was to be the score on the Violence
Scale (Andrew, 1974a).

However, several empty cells occurred.
To make possible an appropriate statistical analysis, the following adjustments
were made. Anglo-Caucasians and
Mexican-Caucasians were combined into
a group called “Caucasians.” Blacks and
“others” were combined into “nonCaucasians.” One empty cell remained, in
that there were no non-Caucasian male
delinquents from small intact families.
The separation by ethnicity was therefore
approached indirectly by examining first
the tota] sample, and then the Caucasians
only. Differences between the two analyses would then be attributable to the
influence of the non-Caucasian sample.

RESULTS

As hypothesized (a), male delinquents
were far more violent than female delinquents (Tables 2 and 3), which supported
many previous studies (Andrew, 19744;
Palmer, 1973).

* From Andrew, 1974a.

Contrary to the hypotheses, however,
the analysis of variance showed no main
effect upon violence scores of either (5)
broken families or (c) large families. There
was a significant interaction between all
three of the independent variables (sex,
family intactness, and family size) as is
shown in Tables 2 and 3. From the data in
Table 2, the effect was traced to the
greater violence of males from large intact
families as compared with all other subgroups (Table 4).

Hypothesis (d) was only partly supported. Both the Caucasian subsample
and the total sample showed a main sex
effect, supporting generality across ethnic
groups. Further, generality appeared in

the finding that large intact families produced more violence than other family
types among Anglo and Black males and
Black females, F (1,139) = 11.74, p <
0.001, with Anglo females reacting differently. Further, within the formailyplanned analysis of variance, interaction
effects (sex X family size; sex X family size
x intact/broken family) appeared stronger
for the Caucasian than for the nonCaucasian subsample.

These interactions appeared to stem
from the greatest violence among Caucasian females being associated with the
small intact family, whereas among males
the Jeast violence is produced by the small
intact family. Within this one family type,

compared with other family types, the
usual male/female difference no longer
exists (Table 5).

When a post-hoc comparison was made
of these groups on the basis of their mean
violence level (Table 6), the difference was
highly significant, suggesting that a fair
amount of variance was accounted for by
these family variables. Nonetheless, replication is required to substantiate this
post-hoc result.

DISCUSSION

Although family variables relate to violence among delinquents, the effects are
not simple ones. Violence was most prevalent among male delinquents within large
intact families—not within the large broken families which produce the largest
number of delinquents (Table 2). This
finding suggests that the dynamics may

differ for the production of delinquency
and violence.

SEX

Although maleness is by far the largest
factor in violence, the gap between males
and females appears to be closing (Andrew, 1974a). This equalizing process may
result from the decreasing national birth
rate, in that more children are being raised
within small intact families in which male
violence is low but is matched by female
violence (Tables 2, 3, 5).

The low incidence of violence among
females probably reflects a common antidelinquency and anti-violence factor for
females, although for males there may be
different factors involved in the incidence
of delinquency vs. violence.

Although males from different ethnic
backgrounds seem similar in regard to the
greater violence of those from large intact
families, there are suggestions that females
from different ethnic backgrounds may

react quite differently. Further, the uneven incidence produces small numbers
within some family and ethnic groups,
making the findings quite tenuous, especially in regard to females. In any case, it
would appear that family/violence relationships cannot be generalized across all
ethnic groups and that further research
should include adequate numbers of sex/
ethnicity/family subgroupings.

Keeping in mind, then, the tentative nature of these speculations, we may question why there should be a sex difference
within most family types with the exception of the smal] intact family. Clues from
other studies (Dion, 1974; Gerber, 1973;
Toby, 1966) suggest that a child may have
a special need for the cross-sex parent,
perhaps in order to complete the formation
of a balanced superego. The broken family
would usually imply father-absence; the
large family may imply relative absence of
the mother, because of her dilution among
many siblings.

BELIEFS

The persistence of beliefs about the
causal effects of broken homes and small
families seems directly opposed to the

prevalence of these patterns among more
violent delinquents. The pattern of large
intact families was more productive of violence than were small broken families.
The present data, then, support Thompson’s (1974) formulations about a cultural
blind spot and suggest that further exploration be made of the nature of this bias.

It is, of course, possible that the bias lies
within the present study, due to lack of
random assignment from the total population of delinquents. However, the evidence of prior studies appears to support
the present formulations, with exceptions
as noted.

Further researchers may wish to initiate
the difficult but crucial longitudinal studies that are needed to establish the predictability of violence from family or other
variables.

SUMMARY

An examination of family variables for
214 delinquents showed that the most violent delinquents were males from large intact homes. The pathogenicity of the large
intact family for males may be difficult to
recognize because of cultural bias.

The least violent males and the most

homes. Within this one family subtype,
females were as violent as males.

child’s need for the cross-sex parent. However, further research is indicated, especially in regard to female delinquents from
various ethnic groups.
