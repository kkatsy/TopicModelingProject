ABSTRACT: Methods of geographic analysis can be used with historical demographic data in
order to investigate the process of population expansion and settlement formation. Such analyses provide information regarding assumptions made by many population genetic models.
These methods were applied to data from north-central Massachusetts (1700-1850) as part of
an ongoing project on population growth and genetic structure. Three methods were used for
analysis: nearest neighbor analysis, analysis of settlement history, and rank size analysis. Nearest neighbor analysis shows the area was settled quickly, and the final distribution of populations was patterned, suggesting a strong relationship of migration and distance. Settlement history shows a pattern of early fissioning of towns, and fusioning in later periods. Rank size
analysis shows there was heterogeneity of population size, but the area did not show a strong
tendency for the development of central places during this time period. The potential genetic

effects of settlement formation are discussed.

Studies of the genetic structure of human populations, and anthropological
genetics in general, seek to determine
the nature of genetic variation (among
and within populations), and to explain
such variation. The use of most models
in population genetics requires simplifying assumptions to be made. The problem here is that one is never certain
whether a particular outcome reflects a
hypothesized cause or is simply indicative of the violation of certain assumptions. The interpretation of measures of
genetic variation requires additional information, particularly with reference
to the culture, ecology, demography,
and history of a set of populations. Seldom can interpretation proceed strictly
from measures of genetic variation. At

the very least, some geographic or historical data are needed.

Many models of population structure
require assumptions which are inappropriate when considering human populations, such as constancy of population
size and migration rates over time, a single founding population for a set of subpopulations, isotropic migration, random mating, and many others.
Recently, studies have attempted to assess the extent to which these assumptions hold. In the process, a number of
interesting effects have been demonstrated which show the uniqueness of
human populations. Such effects include settlement formation (Swedlund,
1984), non-Markovian migration (Kramer, 1981), kin-structured migration

(Fix, 1978), return migration (Relethford and Lees, 1983), and densitydependent migration (Wood et al.,
1985; Relethford, 1986a), among oth
ers,

It is interesting to note that most of
these studies ask essentially demographic questions, dealing with factors
such as population size, migration patterns, and mating systems. The nature
of such effects are best assessed from demographic data directly, and not inferred from genetic data. Biological
data are of course necessary to our efforts, but it is my feeling that we have
tended to overemphasize the collection
and analysis of biological data to the exclusion of demographic, ecological, and
historical data (of course there are exceptions to this). Both approaches are
necessary if we are to understand the
causes and the effects of genetic variation.

In a recent and enlightening paper,
Swedlund (1984) has demonstrated how
historical data may be used to provide
an understanding of the genetic consequences of a population’s history. Also,
research on historical population structure in Oxfordshire parishes (e.g.,
Boyce et al., 1968) has demonstrated
how deviations from assumed settlement pattern can affect migration. This
work, and others, show how a thorough
insight into the settlement formation
and subsequent demographic history of
lp population can aid in resolving many
questions in the study of human population structure.

The purpose of the present paper is
to document the process of settlement
formation in north-central Massachusetts during the period from 1700 to
1850. This paper has three specific goals.
The first, and most general, goal is to il
Settlement Formation

lustrate the use of certain models from
economic geography in assessing population history and potential genetic effects. The second goal is comparison
with other studies from historical Massachusetts (Swedlund 1975, 1984) in order to test the effects of variation in
physical environment on the settlement
process. The third goal is to provide an
in-depth historical background of the region for an ongoing study of demographic change and population structure.

POPULATION HISTORY

In recent years, more attention has
been given to the analysis of the effects
of demographic change on populations
structure (e.g., Swedlund et al., 1976;
Brennan and Relethford, 1983; Relethford, 1985a). Recently, I have begun a project focusing on the effects of
rapid population growth on the genetic
structure of human populations. This
project revolves around the analysis of
vital records from four towns in northcentral Massachusetts, covering the period from 1740 to 1850. Vital records
were chosen for analysis (especially
marriage records) since the questions
asked about population structure are essentially demographic in nature and can
best be assessed using demographic
data. Historical populations were chosen over contemporary groups due to
the advantages of assessing short-term
and long-term trends from historical
data (Swedlund, 1978). Eighteenth-and
nineteenth-century Massachusetts was
chosen due to the rapid population
growth during that phase of American
history (Potter, 1965) and the widespread availability of vital records from

the area during this time (Hanson and
Rutherford, 1981).

Census statistics were examined to
locate an area which not only showed
rapid population growth, but also had
populations of varying size at any given
time period. In this way, the effects of
population size on population structure
could be assessed temporally and spatially. Four towns from north-central
Massachusetts were chosen: Gardner,
Hubbardston, Leominster, and Barre,
all within Worcester County.

The north-central section of Massachusetts is characterized as uplands,
consisting of rolling hills with a maximum elevation of roughly 1,100 feet
(Bearse, 1971). This topography differs
from that of the Connecticut River Val
ley (studied extensively by Swedlund ©

and colleagues), thus allowing a contrast
of environments. Historically, the
north-central region of Massachusetts
was settled later than other regions in
the state. The earliest settlements in
Massachusetts occurred along the eastern coast, and by the 1670’s, settlements
had formed in the Connecticut River
Valley, as part of a northern expansion
beginning earlier from the southern
coast of Connecticut (Friis, 1968). During the seventeenth century there were
few settlements in the north-central region of the state, with exceptions such as
the town of Lancaster (settled in 1645)
established as a post for future fur trade
routes (McManis, 1975). Rapid settlement in the region began after the Peace
of Utrecht in 1715, with many land grant
towns being established in the mid
1700’s (Sly, 1928).

Population growth was related to the
expansion of new towns in colonial Massachusetts. Population growth was rapid
during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, due mostly to relatively low

mortality and high fertility, with immigration having only a minor effect after
initial settlement (Potter, 1965; Lockridge, 1970; Smith, 1972; Swedlund et
al., 1976). As the population grew,
more expansion and settlement took
place in order to meet increased demands for land. It appears that early settlers found the land to be disappointing
since it was so hilly and rough (with the
exception of the fertile Connecticut
River Valley) (McManis, 1975). The initial form of settlement was similar to the
European open field system, where all
inhabitants lived in a nuclear village and
farming took place in large open fields
outside of this area. All inhabitants
farmed on bits and pieces of these fields.
This system gradually gave way to a system of independently owned farms,
where families lived and worked. This
later division of land acted to encourage
further geographic expansion, since
land became a prerequisite for marriage. As in many European cultures,
the settlers practiced impartible inheritance, whereby the land was divided
among sons. Depletion of soil, and lack
of suitable Jand for all sons, Jed to further expansion as the population grew
(Greven, 1970).

A group of settlers would petition the
General Court of the colony for the legal
status of a town and were generally assigned sufficient land for original settlers. Incorporation of a town was initiated by these settlers and was usually :
group action (McManis, 1975). Travel
distance to other towns seems to be a
primary reason for seeking town status
(Swedlund, 1984).

In sum, geographic expansion and
the settlement of new towns was related
to the:rapid growth of the population
and increased outmigration in search of
available land. Swedlund (1975, 1984)

and Paynter (1982) have documented
the settlement process of towns in the
Connecticut River Valley. The present
paper investigates these processes in the
upland region of north-central Massa
' chusetts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Methods of analyzing settlement formation require definition of a study
area. Here, all four towns of primary interest in my ongoing research are within
31 kilonieters of one another. The geographic center of these four towns was
used as a central point for definition of a
larger study area. I defined the study
area as a circle with a radius of 25 kilometers. Previous studies of migration in
historic Massachusetts have shown the
majority of migration takes place within
this distance (Swedlund, 1971; Norton,
1973; O’Keefe, 1976; Kelly, 1977; Adams and Kasakoff, 1980). This radius
also allows direct comparison with
results obtained by Swedlund (1975) for
the nearby Connecticut River Valley.

The selected study area contained 24
towns by 1850. For each of the 24 towns
data were collected regarding year of incorporation, past relationship with
other towns, geographic distance from
the other towns, and census population
size over the time from incorporation to
1850.

Year of incorporation for each town
was obtained from Cook (1948), who
also lists whether a town was formed
from a new settlement or from pieces of
adjoining towns. In this manner, I was
able to determine the historical interconnections of all towns. Geographic
distances (in kilometers) among towns
were computed from longitude and Jatitude using the method of Morton et al.
(1968). Population sizes were obtained

Settlement Formation 279

from census results for nine time periods: 1765, 1776, 1790, 1800, 1810, 1820,
1830, 1840, and 1850. Population sizes
for the first two time periods were taken
from Greene and Harriston (1932), and
all later data were taken from standard
census reports (United States census,
1791, 1801, 1811, 1821, 1832, 1841,
1854).

Two methods were used for analysis:
tiearest neighbor analysis and rank size
analysis. Nearest neighbor analysis, developed by Clark and Evans (1954),
provides a measure of spatial patterning
of units in a defined region on a plane
surface. For each unit (heré towns) in a
region the distance to its nearest neighbor, 7, is determined, and a mean observed nearest neighbor distance is computed over all 1 towns. That is,

Fa = lr/n. (1)

This observed measure is compared
with an expected nearest neighbor distance under random conditions. In a region of area A containing m towns the
expected mean nearest neighbor distance

Fe = 1/2VOiA. (2)

The nearest neighbor statistic, R, is then
computed as the ratio of the mean observed distance to the mean expected
distance. That is,

R=fFa4/lFr. (3)

The value of R can range from 0 and
2.1491, with a value between 0 and 1 indicating clustering of towns, a value of 1
indicating complete random patterning,
and a value between 1 and 2.1491 indicating regular spatial patterning. Clark
and Evans (1954) have derived the

280 Relethford

standard error for the expected mean
distance, allowing a test of the null hypothesis that spatial patterning is random (r = 1). This hypothesis is tested
using the standard variate for the normal curve, where

z= n(F4-Fe)/0.26136V A. (4)

Care must be taken when interpreting
results due to the definition of the study
area. Clark and Evans (1954) point out
that random results may be obtained
from a given area that are actually nonrandom with respect to a larger area.
Temporal changes in the nearest
neighbor statistic can be interpreted
with respect to Hudson’s (1969) model
of rural settlement for colonizing populations. Hudson suggests that there are
three stages in settlement pattern for rural, colonizing populations: colonization, spread, and competition. Colonization consists of the dispersal of
settlements into a previously unoccupied region. The nearest neighbor statistics for this stage will indicate randomness (Swedlund, 1975). The second
stage is spread, most often the result of
population growth, and new settlements
will develop from older ones. This stage
will result in the formation of settlement
clusters (Hudson, 1969). The third state
is competition, which results from the
pressure brought about from the stage
of spread. As populations grow, the
competition for available land increases
and an eventual equilibrium is reached
in terms of population size and spacing.
This stage is characterized by an increase in regularity of spacing and is
seen as a precondition for the later development of central places. If Hudson’s
model is correct, the nearest neighbor
statistic should show a temporal change

from a random spatial pattern to a clustered pattern to a regular pattern.

Rank size analysis provides a means
of evaluating variation in the size of populations, and in turn, an evaluation of
the presence or absence of central places |
within a region. Rank size analysis
makes use of the rank size relation, an
extension of Central Place Theory. Central Place Theory is a model used by geographers to relate population size, spatial distribution, and settlement
function in a given system of populations (Thoman and Corbin, 1974). A
central place in a given system consists
ofacenter of economic activity and population concentration.

The rank size relation is

N = aR* (5)

where N is the size of a population, R is
the population’s rank in size (the largest
population has a rank of 1), and a and b
are estimated parameters from regression (Lowe and Moryadas, 1975; Paynter, 1982). A theoretical relation termed
the “rank size rule” predicts that a is
equal to the size of the largest population, and b is equal to 1. Such a relation
describes a region with a clearly defined
core population and a number of peripheral populations. The terms “‘core”’
and “peripheral” are generally defined
in terms of the flow of economic goods,
but in the context of the present paper
can be considered as general terms de- _
scribing aspects of population size and
migration.

For each cohort for which census
data are available, I performed the regression in Equation (5). Assessment of
deviations from the rank size rule was
used to determine the nature of population size variation and town hierarchy.

According to Paynter (1982), a slope
greater than b = 1 indicates a concave
distribution of population sizes and
ranks, where large populations are

_ larger than expected, and small popula
tions are smaller than expected. Such a
pattern indicates an intense concentration of population in a few locations. A
slope less than b = 1 indicates a convex
distribution where large populations are
smaller than expected, and small populations are larger than expected. This
pattern indicates a more homogeneous
distribution of population sizes in a region. In any given analysis, however, a
convex pattern can have two interpretations. First, the area sampled is peripheral in a much larger system. In this
case, any central places exist outside of
the study area. A second interpretation
is that a number of independent systems
are sampled, each of which conforms to
the rank size rule, but when pooled together give the impression of a convex
relationship of population size and rank.
This interpretation can usually be ruled
out if temporal trends indicate a shift
from convexity to concavity, since there
is usually as tendency for peripheral areas to become core areas (Paynter,
1982).

RESULTS

As defined above, the study area contained 24 towns by 1850. These towns
are listed in Table 1 in order of incorporation, along with their incorporation
dates. These towns ranged in size from
270 to 1,090 in 1765 and from 809 to
5,120 in 1850. Growth rates for several
time periods are also reported in Table
1. The annual intrinsic growth rate, r, is
obtained from the exponential growth
model

size (N) for two different time periods ¢
years apart, the growth rate is computed
as

r = In (Nr/No)/t. (7)

Growth rates for each town are given
from the time of the earliest census to
1850, from the earliest census to 1810,
and from 1810 to 1850. It is clear that for
the total time period growth rates are
high, comparable to those found in developing nations today (Weeks, 1981).
Itis also apparent that growth rates were
generally higher prior to 1810 than afterwards, showing the beginnings of fertility decline. These results are not unexpected, and parallel those found in the
Connecticut River Valley by Swedlund
et al. (1976).

Nearest neighbor analysis was performed sequentially over time, taking
the average nearest neighbor as new
towns were incorporated. The results of
the nearest neighbor analysis are reported in Table 2 for each year that one
Or more new towns were formed. The
observed mean nearest neighbor distance is at first rather high, being almost
30 kilometers. As more towns became
incorporated, the region filled in, and
the mean distance dropped rapidly to
level off between seven and eight kilometers, roughly a one day journey by
foot. As more towns filled the region,
the expected mean nearest neighbor distance dropped as well. The nearest
neighbor statistic shows that for most
years the observed distance is greater
than the expected distance, showing a
nonrandom pattern of settlement. The

nearest neighbor distance (R) is high at
first and drops as more towns are added
to the analysis. This decrease shows the
initial tendency of clustering of settlements. After the seventh town is added

- to the analysis, the nearest neighbor sta
tistic shows an increase, reflecting a
trend toward regularity in patterning.
The values of R are significantly nonrandom for all years after 1762.

These results are similar to those
found by Swedlund (1975) and Paynter
(1982) in their analyses of settlement
formation in the Connecticut River Valley. The basic pattern of settlement is
one of initial clusters giving way to a
more regular spatial pattern, as predicted by Hudson’s (1969) model of colOnization and settlement. Comparison
of the present results with those given by
Swedlund (1975) allows assessment of
topographic variation, since the region
discussed here is upland hills, as opposed to ariver valley. Nearest neighbor
distances and nearest neighbor statistics

are given for both studies in Table 3, using comparisons based on the number of
towns incorporated in a region. Since
the area is the same for both studies, the
expected nearest neighbor distance is
the same for any given number of towns.
In all but two cases the present study
shows a greater observed nearest neighbor distance than found in the Connecticut River Valley. This difference is
significant only for the comparisons involving 21 or more towns. Here, the
present study shows a greater nearest
neighbor statistic, indicating greater
regularity in patterning. Swedlund’s
study shows greater clustering of towns,
most likely reflecting the tendency for
towns to concentrate closer to the Connecticut and Deerfield Rivers.

The sequence of town formation is
shown in Figures 1-4, which show the
geographic location of each town for
four time periods. These figures provide
a graphic supplement to the nearest
neighbor analysis. The first time period,

towns were initially formed along the
southern and eastern fringes of the study
area, reflecting expansion from other
towns outside the study area. This time

Overall, these figures show an initial

River. Given the higher soil productivity of the valley near the river, such a
pattern is not unexpected.

tion is the fissioning of new towns from
old towns, particularly during earlier
time periods. In later periods, a number
of towns (e.g., numbers 18, 22, 23, 24)
form from fusion of two or more towns.
This fusion process acts to ‘fill in”
spaces between previously settled
towns.

Rank size analysis was performed for
the nine census years between 1765 and
1850, and the results are given in Table
4. For each census year the regression
slope is less than 1. Thus, the relationship of population size and rank is convex, showing a deviation from a central
place hierarchy. Here, large populations are smaller than expected, and
small populations are larger than expected. From 1765 to 1820 the slopes decrease, indicating a trend away from primacy in population size. This trend is
most likely due to formation of new
towns from old ones, such that the population distribution becomes more even
over time. From 1820 to 1850 the slopes
increase, as expected when a peripheral
area develops cores (Paynter, 1982),
Historically, this trend continues, such
that today the area has characteristic
core populations. From 1765 to 1850,

however, the development of central
places was just beginning.

DISCUSSION

This paper has focused on population
growth and settlement formation of
north-central Massachusetts in order to
provide background for an ongoing
study of population structure in four
towns in the area. In terms of wider implications, what do such analyses tell us
about the genetic structure of populations? As noted earlier, the models we
use make frequent assumptions which
are addressed best with historical demographic data. In addition to understanding which assumptions are warranted,
and under what conditions, an examination of the settlement process can provide insight into potential genetic effects.

The pattern of population growth
shown here is typical of much of colonial
America, and similar in degree to developing nations today. The primary determinant of rapid population growth in
historical Massachusetts was high fertility. Swedlund (1971) detected a high
mean and variance in the number of offspring per female in the Connecticut
Valley. Preliminary research on the four
towns in the present study suggest similar high levels (Relethford, 1986b). In
terms of genetic effects, a high mean and
variance in fertility will result in a substantial reduction in the effective population size (Crow and Kimura, 1970).

The nearest neighbor analyses provide needed information regarding migration patterns and gene flow. In early
years of settlement, nearest neighbor
distances were large, suggesting that local migration was limited, and longrange migration contributed more to
overall gene flow. Over time, the development of new towns led to a reduction

Vol. 33, No. 3-4

in nearest neighbor distance. It is interesting to note that in both this study and
Swedlund’s (1975) the mean nearest
neighbor distance decreased to between

six and seven kilometers. This corre‘spondence points to the fact that the lo
cation of new towns depended on travel
distance (Swedlund, 1984).

Nearest neighbor analysis can be
used to test assumptions regarding migration. An assumption of most spatial
models of population structure (e.g.,
isolation by distance) is that the migration space is homogeneous and that migration is isotropic (Jorde, 1980;
Swedlund, 1984). In terms of nearest
neighbor analysis, a high value of the
nearest neighbor statistics indicates regularity of patterning, and, hence, homogeneity of migration space and a strong
likelihood of isotropic migration. In the
present paper, the study area develops
this pattern quickly, and a strong relationship of gene flow and geographic
distance would be expected. The assumptions of geographic population
structure models are warranted, at least
after the initial stages of settlement.

The sequence of settlement in northcentral Massachusetts also has genetic
implications. Settlement formation
shows a spread of population from the
south and east to the west and north.
This spread could produce a cline in
gene frequencies, although the entire
settlement of the region may have occurred too quickly to have much of an
effect. Clines would most likely be less
apparent than in the Connecticut River
Valley, where a more noticeable geographic orientation in settlement occurred (Swedlund, 1975, 1984).

The historical relationships of the
towns has implications for genetic relationships. A basic assumption of most
population structure models is that all

Settlement Formation

287

populations have a common founding
population; that is, all are related by a
branching process (Jorde, 1980). In the
present study, all populations do not
share a single common founding population, but rather some have an independent origin, some fission, and some fuse
together, Given the strong relationship
of migration and distance shown in
other studies of this time and region, it is
likely that the relationships among
towns parallel the relationships among
individuals. That is, nonrandom clusters
of gene frequencies can be expected as a
result of settlement history.

Based on the history of the study
area, a pattern of older towns fissioning
and newer towns created by fusion appears to be the basic sequence. Several
hypotheses regarding genetic interrelationships can be formulated from this
pattern. First, fissioning might be expected to produce unique clusters of
gene frequencies due to founder effect,
and also due to kin-structured migration
(where migration is nonrandom with respect to genealogical relatedness; see
Fix, 1978). This seems very likely in the
case of colonial Massachussets, given
historical evidence that initial settlement was often a group action based on
neighborhood and kin ties (Greven,
1970; McManis, 1975). A second hypothesis is that fusion of populations
during the later part of settlement formation leads to increased heterogeneity, as a new town is formed from the
fringes of other towns.

The rank size analyses show that the
study area is a peripheral region and that
there are no strong central places from
1700 to 1850. These results relate to assumptions made regarding population
size and migration. Models of population structure assume that all populations are of equal size. Even though no

central places existed, population size
was not homogeneous throughout the
region (chi-square tests are all statistically significant, P< 0.05). In an area
with characteristic central places such
heterogeneity would be even greater.
The presence of a central place would
also make differential migration likely,
since there is often a tendency for larger
populations to attract more migrants
(Lowe and Moryadas, 1975). In sum,
even in the absence of central places it
does not seem likely that the assumption
of homogeneity in population size and
migration is warranted.

CONCLUSIONS

I have attempted to illustrate how
some of the methods used by geographers can be used to assess the potential
effects of settlement formation and population growth on the genetic structure
of populations. Several conclusions may
be made from these analyses. The settlement pattern of historical north-central
Massachusetts shows a sequence of clustered settlements followed by a random
pattern followed by a strong uniform
pattern. This sequence confirms Hudson’s (1969) model of rural settlement,
with a random settlement pattern
changing to a uniform pattern as the region moves from the “‘colonization”’
stage to the “spread” and “competition” stages. The historical pattern of
town fisstoning in early years followed
by town fusion in later years also fits
Hudson’s model. During the “spread”
stage new settlements formed from
older settlements (fission). During the
“competition” stage, the spacing of
populations reaches equilibrium when
portions of older settlements combine to
fill in vacant land (fusion).

The present study shows both simi

of clustering to random to uniform.
Both studies give results consistent with
Hudson’s settlement model. The
present study indicates a greater tendency toward a uniform settlement pattern in later years. This difference, while
small, is significant and does illustrate
the demographic impact of small microenvironmental differences (uplands versus river valley). The difference between these regions reflects the greater
clustering of communities along the rivers given transportation opportunities
and agricultural productivity along a
river. In the upland region of northcentral Massachusetts, however, there
are no major rivers or other topographic
reasons for clustering of populations.
Rank size analysis indicates a tempo
ral pattern in population size hierarchy.
There is an increase in homogeneity of
population size due to the fissioning of
towns. New towns forming from older
Ones acts to limit the development of
larger core populations. After town formation is complete, the region shows a
trend toward the development of larger
cores and the beginnings of a central
place hierarchy. Deviations from population size homogeneity can be expected
to have effects on genetic variation of a
region. Differences in population size*
would lead to differences in the expected level of genetic drift. Also, variation in population size can be expected
to affect migration rates, and, hence,
have an additional effect on genetic variation. The development of larger core
populations is expected to lead to an increase in migration from peripheral
populations to the core, but not in reDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

verse. Combined with differences in genetic sampling due to population size,
such a region would be expected to show
a reduction in genetic variation within
the core populations, and an increase in
genetic heterogeneity among the more
isolated, smaller peripheral populations. Further research using migration
