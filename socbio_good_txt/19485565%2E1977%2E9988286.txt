ABSTRACT: The total consanguineous and nonconsanguineous marriages (” = 7,671) celebrated in
Puchuncavi, Chile, from 1810 to 1959 were analyzed and related to demographic and sociocultural variables. Celibacy, widowhood, and illegitimacy were found to influence the mating
structure of the population, producing assortative mating or lowering the probability of marriage.

“Marriage is a demographic event
through which the component of the
human ecosystem, interacting with biological and cultural inheritance, acts on
human evolution by means of the choice of
the husband or wife” (Moroni and Conterio, 1972). If this definition is accepted,
it is possible to understand why the mating
structure of the human species, with all its
complexities, has largely been studied by
social scientists and biologists. Thus, there
are studies on the theories of mating structure (assortative and random mating,
taboos, etc.) and on the factors that
influence the choice of mate (spouse’s age;
geographical and biological propinquity;
phenotypic, social, cultural, and religious
characteristics, etc.) in primitive as well as
modern populations (Freire-Maia and
Krieger, 1963; Mange, 1964; Kiser, 1965;
Levi-Strauss, 1968; Spuhler, 1968; Johnston et al., 1969; Chagnon et al., 1970,
Fox, 1972; Rosenwaike, 1972; Barrai et
al., 1962; Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1966;
Schull et al., 1968; Girard, 1974; Segalen
and Jacquard, 1971, 1973; Jacquard,
1968, 1969; Henry, 1968, 1969a, 19690;
Langaney, 1969; Kunstadter et al., 1963;
Lewontin et al., 1968; Garrison et al.,

1968). These data are essential for understanding the genetic structure of populations (Kuchemann et al., 1967; Crow and
Felsenstein, 1968; Eckland, 1968; Schull
and McCluer, 1968; Schull, 1972).

In this paper we shall consider some
social and demographic variables which
may affect consanguineous marriages
(CM) and nonconsanguineous marriages
(NCM) in a rural zone of Chile, during a
period of 150 years (1810-1959). These
variables are four: a demographic one,
marital status; and three social ones,
legitimacy, legal affinity, and illegal
affinity. An individual (man or woman)
has legal affinity with any person related
to his (her) first mate and has illegal
affinity with anyone related to a person
with whom he (she) has been sexually intimate.

Our interest stems from two facts: (1)
there is little information about the
influence on the mating structure of the
variables utilized (Girard, 1974), and
practically none for Chile; and (2) we wish
to know if there are characteristics that
could cause some type of homogamy or
isolation, since it has been shown in a
mixed Chilean population that there are

234

Vol. 24, No. 3 Determinants of
several factors which cause the formation
of subgroups with genetic differences
(Pinto-Cisternas et al., 1971).

The area of study is the commune of
Puchuncavi, north of Valparaiso, in the
province of same name. It was chosen because it Is a zone with defined characteristics: low density, clear rurality, poor agriculture, and a very slow socioeconomic
and cultural development (Mattelart,
1965). Data from the census of 1950 show
that in that year 78 per cent of the total
active population (26 per cent) engaged in
agriculture.

With respect to the variables studied,
we made the following suppositions: (a)
that there is a strong deviation from random mating because of the high levels of
consanguinity observed (Lazo et al., 1970);
(b) that the alternatives of each variable
must have the same frequencies in men as
in women; (c) that there are no relationships among the variables studied, with
the exception of marital status and legal
affinity; and (d) that each variable must
have different frequency.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data analyzed were copied directly
from the records of the marriage books in
the parish of Puchuncavi. The complete
data of the total number of marriages (n =
7,671) celebrated from 1810 to 1959 were
transcribed on individual cards of standard format. The period 1810-1959 was
chosen for two reasons. First, the year
1810 was the beginning of Chilean independence; and second, since 1959 new
roads, industries, and schools have broken
the geographical isolation of Puchuncavi
(Vazquez, 1972). The 150 years considered
were divided in three subperiods of 50
years each, to obtain subsamples of similar
size large enough for statistical analyses.

On the card used for each couple, the
following information was included: date

Mating Structure 235
of marriage, type of marriage (CM or
NCM), and the condition of each mate in
respect to: marital status (single, widower,
widow), legitimacy (legitimate, illegitimate), legal affinity (with legal affinity,
without it), and illegal affinity (with illegal
affinity, without it).

To simplify the analysis, the four variables were coded by a four-digit number.
The arrangement of each variable in the
code and the meaning of each digit are as
follows: first digit, marital status (0 = both
mates single, 1 = man widower, woman
single, 2 = man single, woman widow, 3
= both mates widowed); second digit,
legitimacy (0 = both mates legitimate, 1 =
man illegitimate, woman legitimate, 2 =
man legitimate, woman illegitimate, 3 =
both mates illegitimate); third digit, legal
affinity (0 = both mates legally not
affined, 1 = man legally affined, woman
not, 2 = man legally not affined, woman
legally affined, 3 = both mates legally
affined); fourth digit, illegal affinity (0 =
both mates illegally not affined, 1 = man
illegally affined, woman not, 2 = man illegally not affined, woman illegally
affined, 3 = both mates illegally affined).

The frequencies of homogamous (like)
marriages and heterogamous (unlike)
marriages (Segalen and Jacquard, 1971)
were calculated for marital status and
legitimacy. The association between these
two factors was analyzed within and between the different classes of marriages in
time as well as with the consanguinity
phenomenon.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows all the data, grouped in
three subperiods, separated in consanguineous (CM) and nonconsanguineous
marriages (NCM) and ranked in the different classes from the most frequent to
the less frequent. From this table one can
see the following.

Vol. 24, No. 3

1. There are 57 classes of marriages distributed heterogenously in time, CM, and
NCM. The absolute number of each class
is very irregular and in some cases extremely small or absent. In any case, the
heterogeneity is smaller in the CM than in
the NCM.

2. From these 57 classes, and considering the general total, nine classes represent
94.13 per cent of the data, and the more
frequent is the class 0000 (“normal” individuals) with almost two-thirds of the total
(59.13 per cent). There is always a greater
frequency of 0000 couples in CM than
NCM. The 46 remaining classes have values smaller than 1.00 per cent, and 38
classes have values smaller than 0.20 per
cent.

3. The total number of marriages in the
first, second, and third subperiod are, respectively, 33.43, 46.07, and 20.50 per
cent of the general total. This distribution
is probably due to the development and
evolution of the Puchuncavi zone and to
the differences in the accuracy of the data
required from the mates at their time of
marriage.

4, There is an enormous decrease of the
CM from the first to third subperiod,
maintaining nevertheless a high rate of
consanguinity. This fact has been already
demonstrated by Lazo et al. (1970) for this
zone.

5. The frequency of couples in which
the husband or the wife are illegitimate are
very similar on the whole, (Class -1-- has a
frequency of 0.1204 per cent and Class -2-of 0.1171 per cent), but there is an irregular distribution between CM and NCM,
with a greater frequency of Classes 0100
and 0200 in NCM (see Figure 1). This
distribution is natural because an illegitimate child for social reasons, “has no relatives.”

6. Unequal frequencies of couples occur
in which the husband is a widower or the
wife is a widow. The sum of the classes of

Determinants of Mating Structure

237

this type gave the following frequencies:
Class 1--- = 0.0978 per cent, and Class 2--= 0.0413 per cent. There is a greater frequency of Class 1000 than of 2000, and the
total of both classes is always greater in
NCM than CM (see figure 1). The distribution in time is also irregular. Two
possible causes could be: (a) a cultural or
social pattern that renders more possible
the marriage of a widower than a widow,
and of nonconsanguineous than consanguineous persons; and (b) a different mortality of men and women after marriage
(15 to 45 years old). The first explanation
is supported by the census data from Spain
for 1900 (2.92 per cent of marriages of
Class 1000 and 0.66 per cent of marriages
of Class 2000), and from Italy for 1951
(2.85 per cent of marriages of Class 1000
and 0.90 per cent of marriages of Class
2000). The reasons could be economic or
social. The second is supported by the
data of Lazo et al. (1973) on the differential mortality (higher mortality in the
women than in men) in this zone for the
period 1851-60. The different mortality in
Puchuncavi could be due to labor or puerperal complications, because there are no
reasons to suppose, in the absence of other
information, that this difference in mortality could be due to other causes of
death. Finally, we can argue that a differential migration pattern could also be the
cause of this disproportion of widowers
and widows, but we have not enough information to examine this fact.

7. An unequal frequency in classes that
involve legal and illegal affinities, the absolute and relative values being very low.
This distribution is due to the quality of
the variables themselves, there being restrictions which are not always recorded.

Observations 2, 5, and 6 then result in
the following findings: firstly, that the
most frequent class is always 0000, possibly due to positive assortative mating for
celibacy, legitimacy, and absence of legal

and illegal affinities, with greater frequencies in CM than NCM; secondly, that
widowhood and illegitimacy could have a
“negative” effect (ess probability of finding a mate) on the CM; and thirdly, that if
we exclude the class 0000 (“normal”), the
most frequent classes are those which have
only one variable present: 0100, 0200,
1000, 2000, 0001, 0300. With four variables and four alternatives in each vari
able, 256 different classes of marriages are
possible. The 57 classes found in this study
mean that something alters the possible
combinations. A cause could be the different frequencies of each variable, some
very low (legal and illegal affinities). However, we think that the main cause resides
in the variables themselves. Unfortunately, the frequencies of the classes with
two or more variables are too low for us to

Vol. 24, No. 3

conclude that any combination of this
type, in one or both mates, could diminish
the probability of marriage.

Several chi-square tests were done on
the data of Table 1. Because of the absence or small number of classes in some
subperiods or CM and NC, the last 49
classes (3000 to 1102) were regrouped in
only one. All of them, with one exception,
were significant, and we show here those
which corroborate the facts mentioned
above, that is to say, the enormous heterogeneity in the distribution of the different
classes of marriages in time and CM and
NCM and the slightly greater homogeneity of the CM. These chi-squares with
their degrees of freedom (df) and probability (P) are given below:

Comparison among the three subperiods (CM and NCM together), x? =
344.88, df = 16, P < 0.001.
Comparison between CM and
NCM (total data), x? = 132.38, df = 8, P
< 0.001.

Comparison among the three subperiods (CM only), x? = 40.43, df = 16,P
< 0.001.

Comparison among the three subperiods (NCM only), x? = 286.40, df = 16,
P < 0.001.

In order to classify the possible nonrandom distribution of males and females, we
compared the distribution of men and
women, classifying as “normal” individuals those without any impediment, and
as “abnormal” individuals those with
some impediment (widowhood, illegitimacy, legal or illegal affinities). The total
data are given in Table 2 for the three
subperiods and for CM and NCM. From
this table we can see that the relative frequencies of women without impediment
are always greater than those of men
without impediment, in CM as well as in
NCM; but comparing the consanguineous
and nonconsanguineous marriages, the
greater frequencies of both men or women

without impediment are always in the
consanguineous marriages. There is a
negative effect, i.e., a smaller probability
of marrying, for women (consanguineous
or not) and for consanguineous men who
have any impediment.

A similar effect is seen when comparing
couples without impediment with couples
with some impediment (see Point 2 above).
A chi-square test on data of Table 1 between Class 0000 (without impediment)
versus all the other classes (with impediment), also considering consanguinity and
time, gives a value of 251.32, with 7 degrees of freedom, and P < 0.001.

To confirm these results for the individuals and the couples, we compared different classes of couples, but kept the marital
status and legitimacy variables separate
from the affinities variables because of the
smaller frequencies of the latter. The
analysis was done comparing the frequencies of the different classes, and the
observed and expected number for each
class, calculating the expected number as
if the different marriages were at random
(mathematical expectation).

Table 3 gives the total data for different
classes of marriages when marital status
and legitimacy are considered. In parentheses is the expected number. The different classes of marriages are formed by
the following individuals: SL = single and
legitimate, SI = single and illegitimate,
WL = widow(er) and legitimate, and WI
= widow(er) and illegitimate. In the table
and in the text, the woman is always on
the left side of any combination.

The data of Table 3 can be analyzed in
two ways. First, a comparison can be
made between the observed and expected
numbers of each class of marriage in time
and between CM and NCM. Second, a
comparison can be made of the frequency
of each class of marriage in time and between CM and NCM. We find (1) with
only one exception, the homogamous

Pinto-Cisternas et al.

Social Biology

classes (SL X SL, SI x SI, WL x WL,
and WI x WY) always present equal or
greater observed than expected values; (2)
with few exceptions, the heterogamous
classes always present equal or smaller observed than expected values in time as
well in CM and NCM; and (3) the relative
differences between observed and expected values are not uniform either in
time or in CM and NCM.

An analysis of the frequencies of each
class of marriage showed: (a) that the most
representative class is SL x SL, but with
fluctuations in time and always more frequent in CM than NCM. We obtain the
following values: in the first subperiod,
0.7416 (422/569) versus 0.6476 (1,292/
1,995); in the second subperiod, 0.6965
(491/705) versus 0.5377 (1,521/2,829); and
in the third subperiod, 0.7847 (102/130)
versus 0.6500 (938/1,443); (b) that the relative frequencies of the other classes are
always higher in NCM than CM; (c) that
the most frequent classes that follow are:
second, SL X SIand SI X SL; third, SL x
WL and WL * SL; fourth, SI x SI; and
fifth, WL X WL, with the other classes
being very rare; and (d) that the comparison between the reciprocal classes SL X SI
versus SI x SL, and SL X WL versus WL
Xx SL, shows that in the first case the more
frequent class is the SL x SI with few
exceptions, and in the second case the
class SL x WL is always the more frequent.

Ali these findings confirm the facts
noted earlier and permit us to say: (1) that
there is nonrandom mating (assortative
mating) for celibacy and legitimacy and
for illegitimacy and widowhood, demonstrated by the observed number of homogamous couples; (2) that the negative effect
of illegitimacy or widowhood is greater in
CM than NCM; (3) that illegitimacy has
a greater negative effect on women than
on men, and among them the most affected are those in nonconsanguineous

marriages; and (4) that widowhood has a
greater negative effect on women, in conSanguineous or nonconsanguineous marriages, than on men. The tendency of similar people to marry seems clear; in other
words, marriages between consanguineous or nonconsanguineous individuals are
not at random in relation to these variables.

To test the heterogeneity of the different
classes in time as well as CM and NCM,
several chi-square tests were done. The
values are shown in Table 4. The distribution of the different classes is more
homogeneous in CM than in NCM, and
the heterogeneity between CM and NCM
is high.

A similar analysis was not possible with
legal and illegal affinities because their absence is the most common state, which
causes a very low frequency of some classes. However, the analysis of the frequencies of the classes that involved these variables showed (a) that all of them decreased
in time, perhaps because they are not always declared and/or recorded in the
parish files; (0) that the most frequent
classes are those in which the man has
legal or illegal affinity and those in which
the woman has illegal or legal affinity; and
(c) that some classes are probably more
frequent in CM because in these types of

Pinto-Cisternas et al.

Social Biology

marriages they are more carefully recorded.

We examined the relationship between
these two variables, marital status and
legitimacy. We considered only the classes
where the man has legal or illegal affinities
and the woman has legal or illegal affinities, because they are the most representative. In cases where the man or the
woman has had intercourse with a relative
of his (her) future mate, the most frequent
relationship is with single and legitimate
individuals. Of 305 cases of Class --01,
there are 198 cases of Class 0001, 30 cases
of Class 0201, and 30 cases of Class 0101;
and of 38 cases of Class --02, there are 30
cases of Class 0002. In cases where the
man or the woman has had intercourse
with a relative of the first spouse, logically, the most frequent relationship is between widows and widowers. So, of 95
cases of Classes --10, there are 75 cases of
Class 1010, and 7 cases of Class 3010; and
of 25 cases of Class --20, there are 17 cases
of Class 2020, and 5 cases of Class 2220.

Naturally, a work of this type should be
related to the genetic structure of the
population. However, it would be necessary to know some phenotypic or genotypic characteristics related to the variables considered. Unfortunately, we do
not presently have such information. But

we can make some general comments
about this subject. In the first place, we
can say that the lower frequencies of consanguineous individuals and couples with
impediment (widowhood, illegitimacy)
mean that there are no other factors besides nonrandomness causing an increase
of the homozygosis produced by consanguinity. In the second place, we can hypothesize that the presence of assortative
mating for widowhood and illegitimacy
could create some kind of selective disadvantage within the population, if it is possible to relate any particular genetic

characteristics to illegitimacy or widowhood, either directly or indirectly.
