Fertility and Normal Selection for

Cattell (1974) makes a case that there
might be an underlying dysgenic trend in
intelligence. It is surprising that he makes
no reference to the extensive work of the
late Professor Lionel Penrose. It is also
regrettable that his statements concerning
Cattell (1950) are at variance with that
study. Moreover, the value of 0.83 for
heritability which he attributes to Burt
and Howard (1956) cannot be found there,
and he shows some confusion concerning
the concepts of broad and narrow heritability.

Cattell (1974, p. 172) says, “then the
fact that the relatively culture-free tests
show o change could be interpreted to
mean that on some absolutely culture-free
test, there has probably been some slight
decline in the population fluid intelligence
level.” The relatively culture-free test is,
of course, his own, and the investigations
to which no change is attributed are Cattell (1937) and (1950). Concerning the
change in IQ in the interval between the
two studies, he says (Cattell, 1974, p. 170),
“The outcome by my testing was absolutely no change (statistically speaking)
over this period of half a generation”

 

(italics added). He rebukes Dr. Waller in
no uncertain terms (p. 169): “As regards
the second approach, most writers today
assume that the results have shown no
drop in intelligence, but indeed, a significant increase. Dr. Waller cites my investigation as agreeing with all the rest in
showing such an increase. However,
closer scrutiny will show that this is incorrect.”

Unfortunately, Cattell is in error. Closer
scrutiny reveals that he did find a statistically significant increase. To resolve any
doubt, Cattell’s (1950, p. 140) Table 1 and
his comments concerning the change in IQ
are reproduced here.

The actual fate of the mean intelligence, as
measured by tests, is clearly not in accord with
that predicted in 1937. The average measured
intelligence for the whole group has, indeed,
undergone a significant increase, for the difference of means, namely, 1.28 points of I1.Q.,
exceeds the standard error of the difference,
namely .5249, sufficiently to be significant at
the 1 per cent level (C.R. = 2.43; p = .0075, for
an undirectional change).

Discussing Waller’s (1971) estimate of
heritability, Cattell (1974, p. 173) says,
“The most commonly accepted value for
heritability of intelligence, namely, 0.80
(in the most exact work of all, that of Burt
and Howard [1956], it becomes 0.83), is
well above Waller’s value.” A reader looking for the value 0.83 in Burt and Howard
(1956) will be disappointed, for they give
no such value. Their Table XII on page
126 gives components of variance for intelligence under four assumptions. No
combination of genetic components of variance in that table adds to 0.83. Indeed,
Burt and Howard (1956, p. 129) state,
“With the scores of group tests taken as
they stand, we find that as much as 23 per
cent is apparently due to unreliability and
environment and only about 77 per cent to
genetic causes.” So far as the reliability of
Burt’s data is concerned, the reader is referred to Jensen (1974).

There appears to be some confusion in
Cattell (1974, p. 172) concerning heritability. A similar confusion is apparent in
Jensen (1973). It therefore needs to be clarified.

Quantitative geneticists distinguish
carefully between narrow heritability
which they denote by hk? and broad
heritability denoted by H*. Narrow
heritability is defined as the ratio of additive variance to phenotypic variance;
broad heritability, as the ratio of genetic
variance to phenotypic variance. Geneti
Social Biology

cists are mainly interested in the narrow
heritability h?. Some psychologists (Jensen, 1969, p. 42) argue that their interest
lies primarily in broad heritability. Unfortunately, Jensen (1973, p. 47 and p. 148)
chooses the symbol #2 for broad heritability. It is possible that this is the cause of
confusion. Certainly Cattell (1974, p. 173)
confuses estimates of narrow heritability
with that of broad heritability. The value
of 0.80 with which he compares Waller’s
value of 0.65 is for broad heritability and
is the value often given by Jensen. Cattell
(1974, p. 173) gives the formula

[V
2 ee —h or 0

which is for narrow heritability. He is
therefore comparing Waller’s estimate of
narrow heritability with Jensen’s estimate
of broad heritability. Jensen’s estimate of
narrow heritability for IQ is 0.60; compared with this figure, Waller’s (1971) estimate of 0.65 is not too low. There are, of
course, theoretical objections to such estimates.

Cattell’s (1974, p. 171) suggestion of
adding “a third point to the historical plot
of IQ mean, providing what may be the
longest curve (1935, 1949, 1975) not only
for culture-fair but for any truly comparable population intelligence measure” is interesting but, unfortunately, would serve
little useful purpose for two reasons. First,
the city in question, Leicester, has not remained immune to the trend of the
upper-middle class moving into suburbs
and villages; and second, the ethnic composition of the city has undergone some
change. It is doubtful if the mean IQ of the
present population of Leicester can be validly compared either with that of 1950 or
1937.
