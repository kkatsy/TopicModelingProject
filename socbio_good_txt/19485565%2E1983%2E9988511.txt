ABSTRACT: The theories of demographic transition and epidemiologic transition provide
Svehicles for the examination of Navajo fertility, mortality, and growth patterns. The Navajo
-<population is found to be growing rapidly due to decreased mortality and fertility rates which
Shave declined but remain twice as high as U.S. rates. Infectious diseases are now less
important as a factor in mortality, but remain a problem larger than that in the overall United
A States. Rates of death from degenerative diseases have not yet become a great problem among
© the Navajo, but mortality from social pathology (accidents, alcoholism, suicide, homicide, and
& cirrhosis of the liver) is considerably higher than that in the general United States. Discussion of
“each of these specific behaviors and possible etiological factors are presented. In general, it can

be said that the Navajo Indians represent a group which is in the transitional stage of both the

__rate, declining death rate, and an econ>omy based on exploitation of raw mate‘Zrials by outside interests (Kunitz, 1974,
$1981). Since this is a situation which
‘5 characterizes a majority of the world to‘> day, a detailed examination of these
phenomena may yield valuable insights.
By carefully examining demographic
Zand vital processes, we can evaluate the
2 impact of modernization and can formuQlate generalizations.

Two theories which relate population
and health variables to the process of development have received considerable
attention and have gained substantial
acceptance. These are the theory of demographic transition (Weeks, 1981) and
the theory of epidemiologic transition
(Omran, 1971). In the following paper,
the current conditions of the Navajo will
be examined in order to detail the
Navajo experience and also to reflect on
the nature of the existing theories.

The theory of demographic transi

tion, first proposed by Thompson and
later Notestein, describes a pattern in vital events that corresponds to the society’s level of development: High fertility
and high mortality characterize less developed societies. Low fertility and low
mortality correspond generally to industrialized societies. The process of
change occurs in at least three stages. In
Stage One, both fertility and mortality
are high. In Stage Two, the transition
stage, mortality declines and population
soars as births outnumber deaths. In
Stage Three, fertility declines as society
adjusts to lower mortality, economic
changes, and a greater probability of
having children survive to maturity (see
Weeks, 1981, pp. 35-39). This demographic change causes and is caused by
social change. These social changes may
include improved schooling, greater social mobility, economic development,
urbanization and increased participation in the labor force (Demeny, 1974).

In 1971, Abdel Omran augmented
and elaborated upon the theory of de

mographic transition with the idea that
part of the transition to modernity is a
change in the mix of diseases that cause
the majority of a society’s deaths. In developing societies, people die at an early
age from infectious and parasitic diseases, while in more developed populations, people live longer but are subject
to degenerative and man-made diseases
(Omran, 1971). The three stages of the
epidemiologic transition are: (1) the age
of pestilence and famine, (2) the age of
receding pandemics, and (3) the age of
degenerative and man-made diseases
(Omran, 1971, p. 516). As a society undergoes modernization, it will progress
through these various stages.

Most advocates of these approaches
caution that the patterns noted are
broad and vary considerably according
to place and time. The conditions prevailing in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries on which the theory of demographic transition were based are different now; accordingly, the timing of the
stages of epidemiologic transition may
vary considerably. The idea of transition, however, can be applied to examine the current morbidity and vital statistics of the Navajo Indians.

That the Navajos are in the midst of
rapid social and economic change seems
indisputable (Kunitz, 1981). The 1970
census reported the per capita income of
Navajos as $800. In 1980, the Navajo
tribe reports the amount had risen to
about $2,300. Coal trains, uranium
mines, oil rigs, and giant excavating
equipment attest to the economic activity around the reservation. Driving
across the reservation, outsiders are often impressed by the number of new
cars and pickup trucks on the roads. But
this change 1s highly variable and only
affects certain aspects of (and individuals in) Navajo society. Fewer than half

of the homes on the reservation have
piped water and about one in four has a
telephone (May, Broudy, et al., 1977).
Wool production, rug weaving, and silversmithing still figure in the local economy, even though wage labor is increasingly important. Most Navajos still
speak Navajo as their primary language,
and their traditional medicine and religious practices thrive. Nonetheless, it is
true that many Navajos now have advanced educational degrees, and virtually all use modern medicine to some extent (Stewart et al., 1980). Such contrast
between traditional values and modernization are apparent all over the Navajo
reservation (Kunitz, 1977).

Within this context, health and demographic changes are occurring in various ways. In the following paper, the
population structure, fertility, and mortality patterns of the Navajo will be described as they relate to this unique sociocultural situation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The total Navajo population in this
paper was estimated from 1970 census
data. It was then revised upward based
on a renumeration of three local areas
carried out in 1976. Population estimates for each year were made based on
the net change in county population.
The age and sex distribution is based on
tribal enrollment statistics compiled by
the Navajo tribe.

Mortality and natality data for Navajos are compiled by Indian Health Service (IHS) from death and birth certificates. After final statistics are
tabulated for the United States by the
National Center for Health Statistics,
IHS obtains data for communities which
lie within its jurisdiction. Causes of
death are coded according to standard

practice using the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth edition.

The Indian Health Service provides
free comprehensive hospital, clinic, and
community health services to Navajos
residing on or near the reservation. Although Navajos may choose to obtain
health care from private providers, the
majority utilize IHS facilities (Stewart et
al., 1980). For each patient visit and admission, standard IHS care forms are
completed, which provides an extensive
data base.

POPULATION

The Navajo population is structurally
different from the U.S. population as a
whole. In 1978, the median age was 16.4
years as compared to 29 years for the
United States. The following pyramids
graphically demonstrate the difference.
Until ten years ago, the Navajo pyramid
had a triangular shape associated with a
developing country. Pyramids for underdeveloped countries such as Costa
Rica in 1950 (Demeny, 1974) and Madagascar in 1968 (Dadzie, 1968) show a
similar triangular pattern.

Currently, the Navajo pyramid has
the indented base for the lowest age
groups which reflects a decline in fertility in the last decade. The ‘“‘waist”’
reflects the decline in births during
World War II; and the bulge, the postwar baby boom. The baby boom was
great among the Navajo with large increases in fertility which paralleled the
U.S. pattern. One difference, however, was that there was a short lag in
onset and a five-year lag in peak. A second difference is that the birth rates during the Navajo baby boom were twice as
high as U.S. rates throughout the period
(Indian Health Service, 1970).

The current reservation population
(1980) of the Navajo is 146,366. Of this

 

Navajo Indians 3

total, males constitute 70,408 or 48 per
cent, and females 75,957 or 52 per cent
(Indian Health Service, 1980). Tribal
enrollment for the Navajo is 162,303
which indicates 10 per cent live off the
reservation. Much of the off-reservation
population lives in the reservation border towns of Gallup, Grants, and Farmington, New Mexico, and Flagstaff,
Winslow, and Holbrook, Arizona. The
Navajo population is still growing rapidly as will be detailed below.

FERTILITY

The Navajo fertility rate has declined
considerably since 1965, from 55.4 to
33.1 in 1978. The annual per cent of
growth of the Navajo in 1965 was 4.7 per
cent, and from 1965-67 the average
growth was 4.2 per cent. With the later
growth rate as a constant, the Navajo
population would have doubled every
17 years! An examination of Table 1
shows the steady drop since that time.
For the four most recent years for which
there are data (1975-78), the population
growth has slowed to 2.5 per cent to 2.7
per cent annually. This is significantly
lower than the middle 1960’s. But this
rate of growth still indicates that a doubling of population will occur in 26 to 28
years. By comparison, the U.S. population in 1976 was growing at a rate of 0.6
per cent, which will take over one hundred years to double. Therefore, the
Navajo population is still growing over
four times as rapidly as the general U.S.
population.

Other reproduction measures also
reflect higher fertility among the
Navajo. The Total Fertility Rate (TFR)
for the Navajo in 1975-77 was 4,616
compared to the U.S. rate (1976) of
1,768. In other words, the typical
Navajo woman would have 4.6 children
during her childbearing years while the

average U.S. woman would have an average of 1.8. The latest TFR for the
Navajo is slightly below the 1975-77
rate. As shown in Table 2, the current
TFR (1978) for Navajo is 4,406 compared to 1,826 for the U.S.

An analysis of age-specific fertility
rates of U.S. and Navajo mothers (Table 2) shows that the higher fertility of
the Navajo is found in the older age
groups (35 and over). This may indicate
that the older practices of high birth
rates have not only changed over time,
but that younger cohorts of Navajos will
continue to show a decrease in fertility.
Modernization seems to Me changing the
fertility patterns.

One final note for this section is that
over 85 per cent of all Navajo births in
1978 were in hospitals. This is a decided
change from 1965 when 61 per cent of
births occurred in the hospital. Regular
utilization of Western medicine is becoming increasingly institutionalized
among the Navajo (Stewart et al.,
1980).

MoRTALITY

In the last fourteen years, crude
death rates for Navajos have declined to
levels below the general U.S. population (see Table 1). The current crude
rate for the Navajo is 6.3 per thousand
compared to 8.9 for the U.S. This rate
is due in part to fewer deaths but is also
partially an artifact of the younger population. The age-adjusted mortality rates
centered on 1976, however, show that
Navajo mortality is actually 1.4 times
greater than that in the general United
States when the effect of the younger
population is removed. Age-adjusted
rates were used to equalize the age advantage of the Navajo in comparison to
the general U.S. population.

The age-adjusted death rates reinforce the idea of epidemiologic transition and suggest that although well
along the path, the Navajo have not yet
reached the level of development of the
general U.S. population. According to
Omran’s theory, infectious and parasitic

diseases should be leading causes of
death in a developing population, while
man-made and degenerative diseases
are leading causes of death in developed
countries.

Table 3 also indicates that accidents
are the chief cause of death followed by
heart disease, cancer, influenza, and
pneumonia. Notable by their absence
are malnutrition and many infectious
diseases. Although influenza and pneumonia are still problems, it appears that
the Navajo have passed the stage of pestilence and famine and are in the later
phase of the stage of epidemic infectious
disease (see Omran, 1971, p. 516). A recent study (Samet, 1980) of respiratory
disease in New Mexico (64,580 Navajo
lived in New Mexico in 1980) reinforced
Indian Health Service statistics in showing much higher mortality from TB, influenza, and pneumonia among the Indians than among the Hispanic or white
populations. An examination of Navajo
tuberculosis deaths by age indicates that
all deaths are in the older categories indicating a residual and waning problem.

The high rate of accidents compared

to the U.S. rate and the fact that accidents lead all causes suggests that Navajos are beginning the last stage of the
transition in which man-made and degenerative diseases predominate.
Among the Navajo, the agent of this
problem may be the combination of new
wealth, which allows people to buy cars,
and their culture which has not integrated safety practices or placed strict
social penalties on periodic alcohol
abuse among the young (Katz and May,
1979). The process of change and modernization may also be a source of stress
which results in high accident rates (May
and Katz, 1981) and other behavioral
problems. In 1978, approximately 40
per cent of Navajo deaths were the
result of social and environmental pathologies (in categories of mental, accidents, suicide, and homicide). Fifty per
cent of male deaths and only 27 per cent
of female deaths were overtly social- or
behavior-related.

Alcoholism deaths are extremely
high as shown in Table 3. The Navajo
age-adjusted rate is twenty times the national rate. But there may be some

problems comparing these rates with
other populations. Alcoholism deaths
are quite frequently and accurately recorded in Indian country, whereas recording elsewhere is generally not as
sensitive to alcohol involvement. From
the gross magnitude of difference, however, one can conclude that alcohol
abuse and alcoholism is a larger problem
than in the rest of the United States, but
the exact magnitude is not clear.

The trend of certain other behaviorrelated deaths also needs to be examined carefully. For example, the rate for
cirrhosis of the liver, patently an
alcohol-related degenerative disease, is
currently 2.6 times the U.S. rate. Other
behavior-related causes of death are
similarly high among the Navajo.
Deaths due to suicide and homicide are
2.3 times as frequent as among the U.S.
population. In all cases, these statistics
indicate a rise from those found in
studies of ten to fifteen years ago. Cirrhosis studies among the Navajo in the

middle 1960’s indicated that the Navajo
rate was the same as that in the general
U.S. population (Kunitz et al., 1969).
Similarly, homicide and suicide rates
were found to be strictly comparable to
U.S. rates in the period from the early
1950’s through 1965 (Levy et al., 1969;
Levy, 1965). Therefore, a significant
rise in all of these behavior-related
deaths is indicated by current data. This
rise may provide further evidence of an
epidemiologic transition.

The epidemiologic transition model
would predict that Navajos may be on
the threshold of increased degenerative
diseases. Overall, 27 per cent of Navajo
deaths were related to the respiratory
system, circulatory system, or neoplasms in 1978. In both rankings and
rates, the Navajo were much less
afflicted by degenerative diseases than
the U.S. population as a whole. Two
recent studies have failed to detect evidence of significant changes in rates of
myocardial infarctions among the

Navajo (Kunitz, 1980; Coulehan, 1980).
Nevertheless, physicians who have
worked in hospitals on the reservation
for many years continue to note that the
numbers of patients seen with myocardial infarctions is increasing.

A more striking and realistic picture
of Navajo mortality can be seen by examining age- and sex-specific death
rates. Much of the current Navajo mortality occurs to males of a very young
age. Table 4 indicates that between ages
25 and 34, Navajo males die at six times
the comparable U.S. rate; between 35
and 44, the Navajo male mortality rate is
1.5 times the U.S. rate. Female mortality follows the same pattern compared
to the U.S. population, but with a
slightly lower ratio. Whereas the ratio of
Navajo male deaths to U.S. male deaths
for ages 25-34 is 6.1, the ratio for females is 4.7; for men aged 35-44, the ratio is 3.8 and the ratio for females is 2.5.
At ages above 45, the male-female ratios are nearly the same.

When Navajo male and female mortality experiences are compared, the
age-specific ratios are similar for children, but between ages 15 and 44, male

mortality rates are about three times the
female rates; between 45 and 64, the
male rates are about twice the female
rates, and above 65 years, there is again
no difference. Closer examination of the
age-specific causes of death show accidents and violence to be the factor which
distinguishes male and female mortality. A recent multiple decrement life table showed the Navajo life expectancy
to be 65 years of age which is about
seven years lower than that in the U.S.
(Carr and Lee, 1978). Further, it
showed that elimination of automobile
accidents from the male mortality experience would add 5.17 years to male life
expectancy at birth. Also, for males,
elimination of other accidents would
add 3.13 years and elimination of cirrhosis of the liver would add 1.48 years. In
contrast, for women, the greatest gains
in life expectancy at birth would be
achieved by eliminating circulatory diseases. The second greatest gain for
women would be obtained by eliminating automobile accidents. Similar analysis showed that elimination of automobile accidents for U.S. white males and
females would add only about a year to
male life expectancy and less than half a
year to female life expectancy (Carr and
Lee, 1978). The unavoidable conclusion
must be that when age and sex are controlled, Navajo men experience different patterns of mortality than either all
U.S. men of the same age or Navajo females at similar ages.

Figure Two is a graphic representation of the overall problem of young
deaths of the Navajo over the last nineteen years. In 1960, death to children
under five years of age was the major
mortality problem. In 1978, however,
the largest early death problem lies in
the ages 5 to 44. Only part of this prob

lem is accounted for by the age structure
as indicated by the previous age-specific
and age-adjusted rates.

INFANT MorRTALITY

Between 1965 and 1978, the infant
mortality rate for the Navajo dropped
from a high of 52 per 1,000 live births in
1966 to 15.2 in 1978. This dramatic decline has closed the gap between the
Navajo infant death rate and the U.S.
average infant death rate. However,
there are two major differences between
the Navajo rate and the overall U.S.
rate. First, the Navajo neonatal death
rate at 7.6 per 1,000 live births is less
than the U.S. rate (9.9 per 1,000). Second, the Navajo post-neonatal rate is
considerably higher, 10.46 compared to
4.2 deaths per 1,000 live births in the
U.S. population. This pattern has prevailed for a number of years and is not
easily explained.

It has been suggested that high-risk
neonates are hospitalized longer by the
Indian Health Service or are frequently
referred for specialized care. The general argument might also be made that
Navajos have unlimited free health
care; hence, there are fewer impediments to seeking prenatal care and extended hospitalization. If true, this advantage may be negated or diminished
by poor roads, long distances to clinics
and a feeling of alienation from Western
medicine. The average length of hospital stay for the Navajo newborn is 2.7
days compared to National Center for
Health Statistics data of 4.3 days for the
average U.S. newborn. This figure is
significantly less for the Navajo which
may indicate fewer newborn complications for Navajo babies. The tendency
of Navajo.women to have heavy babies
has been documented (Adams and
Niswander, 1968) and may be protective

during the first month of life, thereby
lowering the rate of neonatal deaths.

Considerable evidence indicates that
the home environment may pose more
severe hazards for Navajo postneonates. Parents may be less able to
identify fatal symptoms and have more
difficulty reaching health facilities; infants may be exposed to hazards from
unrefrigerated food and from water
hauled from community wells and
stored in metal drums (May, Broudy, et
al., 1977). There are limited published
data which specifically link factors to the
actual deaths, but these high-risk conditions do exist.

In order to provide insight into the
high post-neonatal death rate, one
author (D. W. B.) reviewed the records
of 70 Navajo post-neonatal deaths and
compared them to those of other newborns who survived one year and were
the next discharge following the child
who died. This general comparison
failed to isolate environmental, health
history, or utilization variables which
clearly separated the post-neonatal
deaths from the control group. It was
noted, however, that the post-neonatal
fatalities had longer hospital stays as
newborns and, in retrospect, the ultimate causes of death were present to
some degree at the time of discharge
(i.e., minor congenital anomalies, susceptibility to infection). This finding
suggests that increased emphasis on the
teaching of care for newborns and access
to services in the first year might serve to
mitigate the effects of the high-risk environment on the child. Obviously, detailed analysis on a number of similar
cases needs to be done in a manner which
considers physical and social environment as well as health-care variables.
Only after this sort of detailed analysis
can definite conclusions be drawn.

Social Biology

A final aspect of the difference between post-neonatal and neonatal
deaths in the Navajo and in the general
U. S. population may be that interventions such as family planning and prenatal care, which have been provided for a
number of years, tend to reducé the
number of high-risk neonates. But
among the Navajo a lower utilization of
prenatal care has been reported than is
reported for other groups (Slocumb and
Kunitz, 1977). Similar care-advocate
programs for the post-neonatal period,
however, have seldom been implemented or been effective.

It is apparent from Table 5 that
Navajo infants die from diarrhea and
respiratory disease at much higher rates
than do infants in the general U. S. population. Rates for other causes of death
are lower for the Navajo than for the
general population. It may be useful in
considering Navajo infant mortality to
compare Navajo rates in 1978 to Navajo
rates in 1949 and to rates in other places
in the Western hemisphere in about
1970. This will help place the Navajo in
perspective in terms of its demographic/
epidemiologic transition.

The Navajo infant death rate in 1949
was comparable to that of rural El Salvador in 1970 except that the causes of
death for the Navajo were relatively
evenly distributed between respiratory,
diarrhea, and perinatal causes. This distribution resembles Monterrey, Mexico, and La Paz, Bolivia, in 1970 (Puffer
and Serrano, 1973). Monterrey, Mexico, is an industrial city in northern Mexico and La Paz, Bolivia, has the distinction of being one of the highest cities in
the world in one of the poorest, most
revolution-prone countries in the hemisphere. On the other hand, if the current
Navajo rates are compared to those of
suburban California in 1970, it can be

late to progress in the demographic and
epidemiologic transition. The Navajo
reservation, after many years of isolation, is now an area of great economic
and social change. The effect of this
change on the vital patterns of the tribe
is becoming obvious.

In only the last two decades, there
has been a decided change on the
Navajo reservation from a subsistence
economy to an increased dependence
on wage labor. This change has been
very rapid due to the imposition of outside capital and interests on the Navajo.
Federal monies and corporate funds
have come in great quantities to the
Navajo as a group and effected rapid
changes in the Navajo reservation and
the entire economic system.

Socially, change has been uneven. It
has been rapid in some areas while in
others the old cultural traditions remain
quite constant (Kunitz, 1977). Some authors have noted an increasing trend in
the Navajo family structure (Kunitz and
Levy, 1981) from extended to nuclear.
The functions of the extended family are
becoming less important which is common in societies undergoing a demographic transition. The living standard,
particularly in younger wage-work~
oriented families, is improving. Food in
an adequate nutritional supply from
consumer and government sources is
more readily available. In fact, overconsumption of “junk food” is now a
major concern of some health officials.
The tribal government and its bureaucratic entities have been growing rapidly
and have been constantly changed to
keep up with the pressing needs of modernization. But in all of this change,
much remains constant. Values which
guide Navajo behavior have been somewhat slower to change. Many of the old
traditions remain.

Vol. 30, No. 1

In this situation of uneven change,
the demographic and epidemiologic patterns also appear to be uneven and in
transition. From population variables to
causes of death, the patterns show
change and influence from a number of
diverse elements.

The annual growth rate of the
Navajo, 2.5-2.7%, is lower now than at
any time since 1965, but it still remains
at the “explosive growth” rate (Bogue,
1969). This rapid growth exists from a
combination of past fertility patterns
and the imposition of a modern health
care system which has lowered or eliminated many types of mortality. The population of the Navajo still maintains a
high growth pattern, but a lowering of
fertility appears to be underway. The
highest fertility is found in the older
women, while the younger women show
a pattern of lower fertility. Nevertheless, with a large concentration of
women in the childbearing ages, population growth is insured for some time.
The Navajo population is firmly entrenched in the second stage of the demographic transition, the transitional
stage. At this point, Stage Three, or incipient decline, seems quite unlikely in
the near future. One might anticipate
that with the current massive withdrawal of federal support funds from the
Navajo reservation, a temporary decline in wage-work orientation will occur. With this decline and a partial return to subsistence activities, will there
be a small surge in birth rates or will an
economic depression mentality result in
a lower birth rate as in the Depression of
the 1930’s?

The mortality pattern of the Navajo
is Characterized by some remaining premodernization patterns. Post-neonatal
mortality rates are still highly influenced
by infectious diseases even though the

Navajo Indians

13

overall infant mortality rate has been
lowered dramatically in recent years.
Also, in the entire population, some infectious diseases are still evident. “‘Influenza and pneumonia” remains the
fifth leading cause of death and takes
three times more lives than in the general U.S. population. Degenerative
diseases are becoming more severe
problems among the Navajo, although
the rates of heart disease, cancer and
stroke are still considerably lower than
those of the overall U.S. population.
These rates do not seem to be increasing
rapidly.

Some major health problems have
resulted from the social change toward
modernization. Deaths which are
overtly associated with social patterns
and environment comprise the most serious health problems. The leading
cause of death is motor vehicle accidents. Alcoholism is becoming a greater
mortality problem, and cirrhosis of the
liver, suicide, and homicide arc all increasing in importance as leading causes
of death. It is possible that increasing sociocultural stress from change and pressures of acculturation account for the
high rates of death from these social pathologies (Hackenberg and Gallagher,
1972; Stull, 1972, 1977). Another factor
in motor vehicle accident death rates
may be related to the persistence of fatalistic cultural values which discourage
routine safety practices (Katz and May,
1979). Alcohol abuse in the form of
flamboyant binge drinking, with resultant high blood alcohol levels, also plays
an important role in motor vehicle accidents and to some degree in suicide and
homicide (see Levy et al., 1969; and
Levy and Kunitz, 1974). Deaths from alcoholism and cirrhosis of the liver, on
the other hand, result from chronic alcoholism which is limited to a small proDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

14 Broudy and May

portion of the population, since many
Navajos do not drink at all (Levy and
Kunitz, 1974). Those who do drink persistently are in many cases socially ostracized. This practice may produce higher
death rates from these causes than if rehabilitation were a stronger norm (Levy
and Kunitz, 1974). Chronic alcoholism
deaths, then, also relate strongly to the
social and cultural values of alcohol use
and alcoholism.

In summary, it seems evident that the
Navajo are also in transition regarding
epidemiologic variables. Many disease
patterns exist which are influenced by
older traditional patterns and conditions
of social life and values. But new patterns of death are emerging which are
man-made and are a result of modernization and the existing mix of sociocultural elements and values in contemporary Navajo life.

In his article on epidemiologic transition, Omran (1971) indicated that a society which has a life expectancy of over
30 years had reached the last stage of
transition, the age of degenerative and
man-made diseases. He also stated that
in this stage the birth and death rates
were below 20 per 1,000. The Navajo
experience indicates a more complex or
slightly different pattern. The Navajo
are now less prone to die from infectious
diseases than in previous years. Degenerative diseases may be becoming more
important, and man-made diseases (especially behavior-related) are outstanding problems. The Navajo life expectancy of 65 years places them in Omran’s
last stage as does the death rate which is
well below 20 per 1,000. But the fertility
rate and population growth remain
high. The Navajo straddle Stage Two
and Stage Three of Omran’s theory.
They are not completely through the latter Stages of the age of receding pan
 

Social Biology

demics and are in some ways only beginning the age of degenerative and
man-made diseases.

The Navajo experience, then, shows
exceptions to Omran’s theory in two
ways. First, the continued high rate of
growth and fertility may reflect the fact
that the health care system and modern
medicine were rapidly implemented on
the Reservation independent of intrinsic
Navajo values and the process of modernization. The low fertility values associated with modernization have not
caught up with the rapid mortality decline. In other words, the federal health
care system was imposed in a manner independent of the other modernization
factors. As has been shown with many
Other groups, particularly underdeveloped countries, infectious diseases are
more easily cured and mortality more
quickly lowered than fertility patterns.
This is particularly true when the health
care improvements are imposed from a
force external to the society’s own culture.

The second exception to Omran’s
theory is indicated by the differential
rate of progression in the man-made and
degenerative diseases. The Navajo rates
of death from social pathologies have
risen quite rapidly while only small increases are being registered in the degenerative diseases. This finding might
be expected, but the magnitude of the
rise in these man-made diseases should
be emphasized. In the Navajo case, social conditions and social items (l.e.,
wage labor opportunities, alcohol availability, motor vehicles, etc.) are changing rapidly, but the values surrounding
their use and safe use are adopted
slowly, if at all. Therefore, with rapid
modernization, socially induced mortality and morbidity increase much more
rapidly than degenerative diseases.
ee

Vol. 30, No. 1

The implications of this paper for social and health planning are quite obvious. The major challenge of intervention for future health improvements will
be in behavior-oriented health problems. Programs to reduce motor vehicle
accident mortality, alcohol abuse, and
other social problems need to be creatively explored. Emergency medical
services, public awareness, and culturnally sensitive economic development
= should be encouraged. Infectious disa ease intervention is still necessary, but
6 the need will probably decrease in im9 portance in the future. Of particular im
& portance to infectious disease preven: tion is improved sanitation and

The demographic and epidemiologic
transition are both underway among the
Navajo Indians. The Navajo seem at
present to represent a transitional population as defined in both theories. They
remain a rapidly growing population
which is experiencing fewer deaths from
infectious disease and more deaths
which are a result of particular social
patterns.
