A Note on the Consistency
of Life Tables for Total Populations
with Those for Their Subpopulations

ABSTRACT: The life table for the total population, when constructed from the overall
age-specific mortality rates, becomes inconsistent with the life tables for its
between-heterogeneous subpopulations. The consistent life table for the total population can be
derived from those for the subpopulations, when the latter are constructed with radixes
proportional to the distribution of these subpopulations at birth. As an example, this
consistency approach is used to reconstruct the total life table for the United States for 1984
from those for white males, white females, nonwhite males, and nonwhite females, and to
compare it with the corresponding life table computed by the conventional method by the U.S.
National Center for Health Statistics. The expectation of life at birth for the total population by
the consistency approach is found to be 74.37, which is 0.38 year lower than the NCHS number

of 74.75.

Overestimation of life expectancy
due to heterogeneity in individual frailty
has recently been discussed by some authors (e.g., Keyfitz and Littman, 1979;
Vaupel et al., 1979; Vaupel and Yashin,
1985). In other words, if a population is
divided into a number of between-heterogeneous and within-homogeneous
subpopulations, then the life table for
the total population constructed in the
conventional way from the overall agespecific mortality rates will be inconsistent with the life tables for the subpopulations, because the former will depend
on the observed sizes of the subpopulations by age whereas the latter will not.
The consistent life table for the total
population can be obtained by “adding”
the life tables for the subpopulations,
when the latter are constructed with radixes proportional to the distribution of
these subpopulations at birth. The
present paper studies the problem of inconsistency and overestimation of life

expectancy of the conventional total life
table by constructing an alternative total
life table by the consistency method
based on four subpopulations, viz.,
white males, white females, nonwhite
males, and nonwhite females.

The U.S. National Center for Health
Statistics (1987) has recently published
the abridged life tables by race and sex
for the year 1984 which include those for
white males, white females, nonwhite
males, nonwhite females, and total population. These five life tables are constructed independently from the agespecific mortality rates for the respective
populations. The expectation of life at
birth for the total population is given as
74.75 whereas those for the four subpopulations are, respectively, 71.84,
78.74, 67.36, and 75.05.

The expectation of life at birth (é,) in
1984 is the expected number of years a
newborn baby will survive, if, at each
age, he (she) is subjected to the mortal
158

ity rate for the age as observed in 1984.
If the age-specific mortality rates are different for different subpopulations, the
newborn baby should be subjected to
the mortality rates for the subpopulation to which he (she) belongs. In order
to compute é, for 1984 for the total population, it, therefore, becomes important to know the distribution of the subpopulations at birth as observed in 1984.
Using this distribution (NCHS, 1986),
Sand the é,’s for the subpopulations from
‘above, we find the é, for the total popu2lation i is 74.37, implying that the é, of
974. 75 computed by the NCHS directly
Afrom the age-specific mortality rates for
Sthe total population is an overestimate
Gland is not consistent with the é,’s for the
“four race-sex groups.
< The reason for this inconsistency is
‘Snot difficult to understand. When a life
-=table for the total population is con2 structed from the age-specific mortality
“rates, it is recognized that these rates
S vary from age to age and that, therefore,
iz Zit is necessary to control for the age
2 > structure of the population. This control
5 Fis achieved by using the age-specific
mortality rates and an initial cohort (ra5 = dix) of 100,000 persons (or any other
3g 8 convenient number), and by ignoring
£ the observed age structure of the popu2 lation. Likewise, providing life tables
& for different race-sex groups implies the
recognition of the fact that the mortality
rates for an age vary from one race-sex
group to another and that it is necessary
to control for the age-race-sex structure
of the population. This control can be
achieved by using the age-race-sex specific mortality rates and an initial cohort
of 100,000 persons divided among the
basic race-sex groups in proportion to
their numbers born in 1984 (or any other
specific year), and by ignoring the observed age-race-sex structure of the

population. Since the age-specific mortality rates depend on the observed racesex structure of the population, computation of the life table for the total
population based on these rates fails to
control for the race-sex structure of the
population. This gives rise to the inconsistency of the life table numbers for the
total population by the conventional
method with those for its subpopulations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Suppose a population can be divided
into K subpopulations between which
age-specific mortality rates vary significantly. Let l,;, Tx;, and é,,; be the life
table values at age x for the subpopulation i for a particular year
(/,,; = 100,000), and B;, the births to
subpopulation i during the same year

k
( Zi B; = B).
i=1

The above three columns of the life table
for the total population by the consistency

approach will be given by

males, nonwhite females, and total) for
1984 constructed by the conventional
method, as published by the NCHS. In
order to compute the consistent life table for the total population, we make
use of the following distribution of
births in 1984 by race and Sex:

White males ..............00% 1,500,326
White females ............... 1,423,176
Nonwhite males .............. 379,164
Nonwhite females ............ 366,475

Total oo... cece cee eee 3,669,141

RESULTS

The four life tables in Cols. 7-10 of
Table 1 are kept unchanged from those
in Cols. 2-5 except that each /, (or 7,)
value is now multiplied by the proportion of births (out of total births) in the
corresponding race-sex group. For example, for white males,

1, = 100,000
x 1,500,326/3,669,141 = 40,890,
T, = 7,184,403

x 1,500,326/3,669,141 = 2,937,730.

The four /, and T, values in Cols. 7-10
are added up to obtain the corresponding consistent J, and T, values for the total life table in Col. 11. For example,
I, = 40,890 + 38,788 + 10,334

+ 9,988 = 100,000,
T, = 2,937,730 + 3,053,999 + 696,085

+ 749,582 = 7,437,397.

The é, values for the consistent total life
table in Col. 11 are obtained in the usual
manner, 1.e., by dividing the 7, values

, by the corresponding /, values. For ex
ample,
€, = 7,437,397/100,000 = 74.37.

We notice that the é, values in Cols. 7~
10 remain the same as those in Cols. 2—5
since both /, and the corresponding T,
values are multiplied by the same factor.

Social Biology

However, the é, values for the total population in Col. 11 show some changes
from the corresponding values in Col. 6.
This finding implies that the é, values
(and hence the other life table values as
well) for the five life tables in Cols. 2-6
are not internally consistent.

Jn order to make a better comparison
of the conventional total life table with
the reconstructed consistent total life table, we present the per cents of overestimation of the l,, T,, and é, values by the
conventional method in Col. 12. For example, the per cent of overestimation of
ess iS given by

(24.21 — 23.97) x 100/23.97 = 1.00.

The per cent “errors” in Col. 12 for the
values in the conventional total life table
reveal some patterns. Since all /,
columns start with 100,000, Col. 12 does
not show any errors in /, values in the
first few age groups, but then, the error
increases consistently with age. The
largest overestimation in /, is found to be
3.39 per cent in the age group 85+. The
T, values—theoretically, the cumulations of the /, values from the bottom—
show errors right from the first age
group. These errors also increase with
age, but at slower rates than those in the
/, values. The largest overestimation in
T, is 2.78 per cent in the age group 8085. Since é, is the ratio of T, and I,, the
pattern of the errors in é, values depends
on those of i, and 7, values. The errors
in é, increase with age and then start declining. The highest error in é, is an
overestimation of 1.00 per cent in the
age group 55-60.

in this paper clearly demonstrates the
possibility of overestimation of expectation of life when a population is heterogeneous.

The most important column of a life
table is the é, column, and, therefore,
the overall picture of inconsistency of
the life table of the total population constructed by the conventional method is,
to some extent, indicated by é,, the expectation of life at birth. This number is
74.75 by the conventional method and
74.37 by the consistency approach. In
other words, the é, by the conventional
method is 0.38 (i.e., 0.50 per cent)
higher than the corresponding consistent value for é,. Whether overestimation of this magnitude is significant or
not is a matter of subjective judgment.
However, we should keep in mind that

since the conventional method is independent of the race-sex distribution of
the births for the year, there is no guarantee that overestimation of é, values
for various ages will always remain
within “‘tolerable”’ limits.

Besides the magnitude of error, another important question pertains to the
policy, viz., whether or not it is desirable
that the published life tables by race-sex
groups be internally consistent among
themselves. It is interesting to note that
the official total life table estimates the
average number of years a newborn
baby will live without any regard to the
race-sex distribution of the births, although separate life tables for race-sex
groups are provided to recognize the
race-sex differentials in mortality.
