ABSTRACT: To elucidate the nature of the relationship between infant mortality in China and a
variety of covariates using data from the 2/1000 Chinese Fertility Survey, we use a logistic regression model where the covariates are transformed with the help of Alternating Conditional
Expectation (ACE) algorithm. This approach is used to overcome the general problem in multivariate regression analysis of coding the independent variables so that relationship between independent variables and response variables is best described, rather than coding such variables
in an arbitrary way. The study demonstrates the procedures and usefulness of the ACE guided
transformation in multivariate analysis. The transformed covariates are then used to estimate
the effects of a series of socioeconomic and demographic factors collected in the study of infant
death in China. The study shows that after appropriate transformations, all the demographic
and socioeconomic variables selected have statistically significant and direct influence on infant
death.

In recent years a great deal of attention eration of coding the explanatory varihas been focused on the mechanisms ables in multivariate analysis.

25-34, and 35+) in their log-linear regression analysis of demographic determinants of early child mortality from 39
World Fertility Surveys and found that
mortality is higher among children of
teenage mothers but not higher among
children born to mothers at older ages,
even those with mothers ages 35 or over.
In contrast, an earlier log-linear hazards
model analysis of the covariates of infant
and child mortality using the World Fertility Survey in Sri Lanka by Trussell and
Hammerslough (1983) cut the maternal
age into three groups (10-19, 20-34, and
35+) and found that death rates among
children under 10 born to women less
than 20 years of age were substantially
(29 per cent) higher than for children
born to women 20-34 years of age, as
were death rates of children born to
women aged 35 and over (21 per cent
higher). When maternal age was treated
as an interval variable, a U-shaped association of maternal age with child mortality was strongly supported in the hazards
model analysis of child mortality in
Guatemala by Pebley and Stupp (1987)
and in Nepal by Retherford et al. (1989).
Although those inconsistent conclusions may be due to different datasets and
methodologies, different ways of coding
the variable of maternal age may be another important contributing factor which
also makes comparison of the results
across different studies difficult. This is
also the case for the association of infant
and child mortality with length of the
previous birth interval. It is likely that
mortality risks change smoothly with
changes in such covariates, rather than
exhibit sharp discontinuities, and models
which permit this form of relationship
should lead to more realistic and statistically efficient models as well as provid

ing a better basis for policy evaluation
and recommendations.

There are a number of methods available for the transformation of independent variables in regression analyses
(Box and Cox, 1964; Guerro and Johnson, 1982; Hastie and Tibshirani, 1986;
Kay and Little, 1987). However, lack of
availability of computing software for
those methods has limited their applications. We use the well-developed ACE
(Alternating Conditional Expectation) algorithm (Breiman and Friedman, 1985;
De Veaux, 1989) for variable transformations in this. exploratory multivariate
analysis of the impact of a number of
demographic and socioeconomic variables on infant mortality in China. The
paper shows how ACE is used to indicate
the best transformation of the covariates
included in the model so that the relationship between the independent variables
and response variable can be best described in a logistic regression model.

Our study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between a
variety of covariates and infant mortality
in the following two important aspects.
First, we use ACE algorithm to suggest a
set of candidate codings for the explanatory variables and calculate the corresponding Bayes factors to select the best
coding. This method overcomes the problem of subjectively coding the independent variables in multivariate analyses of
infant mortality, and their relationship
with infant survival is best described.
Second, since our data on infant mortality
are taken from a very large, nationally
representative sample, our results are expected to provide more reliable estimates
of covariates of infant mortality in China
than previous research based on regional
studies (Tu, 1989; Ren, 1995, 1996).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for this analysis came from
the China 1988 Fertility and Birth Control survey, often referred to as the “Two
per Thousand Fertility Survey.” It was
conducted by China’s State Family Planning commission from 1 July 1988 to 15
July 1988. The survey, representing a
sample of two per 1,000 persons in mainland China, targeted ever-married resident women aged 15-57 years old. All
provinces in the Chinese mainland took
part in the survey. A single-stage nonproportional stratified cluster sample design was used to select 13,966 sampling
points throughout the country. The sampling point was a small group with an
average of 150 persons resident. The
sample was stratified by province. The
sampling fraction was 1.98 per 1,000 for
the whole mainland population. However,
within provinces various sample fractions
were taken with the aim of obtaining representative data for each province. The
average number of persons sampled per
province was 72,000; altogether 2.15 million individuals were interviewed including half a million women aged 15-57
(Lavely, 1991). Therefore, it is larger and
more complete than earlier surveys such
as the In-Depth Fertility Surveys of 1985
and 1987 (Ren, 1995, 1996).

Along with the socioeconomic and
demographic characteristics, this survey
collected detailed information on the retrospective birth histories, including information on survival of infants, of eligible
women aged 15-57. For each child, information on the sex, parity, mother’s age at
the time of the birth, and socioeconomic
characteristics of the parents was collected,
enabling differentials by these variables to
be estimated. Thus the survey permits in

vestigation of infant death occurring as far
back as 40 years before the survey, so that
trends can be examined. However, the sample design means that older mothers are
progressive removed from the sample, so
that, for example, the oldest mother in the
sample who gave birth 30 years before the
survey was 27 years of age at that time.
Moreover, the early sample results are subject to selectivity in that, for example,
women with a large number of births in the
early part of the study period must have
had these births at a young age, and so they
will not be representative of the whole
group of women who had births of that order in that year. We account for such distortions by fitting a multivariate model
with appropriate controls.

Another major problem in using data
from retrospective studies is that they may
suffer from recall errors on dates of birth
and death of child, particularly for events
which took place further back in time.
However, the unusually high accuracy in
reporting age-related life events in recent
Chinese fertility surveys and censuses has
been documented (Coale and Banister,
1994). In Chinese tradition and culture, age
is reckoned in the lunar calendar system, in
which each year is represented by the name
of an animal with a specified characteristic
in a 60-year cycle of 12 animals and five
characteristics for each animal. Most parents, even if illiterate, know the exact day
of their children according to this lunar
calendar. In conducting the 1988 2/1,000
Survey, interviewers asked each eligible
woman the birth date of each of her children either in the Chinese calendar or Western calendar. If the birth date was given in
the Chinese calendar, the interviewer then
translated this date into the Western calendar with the help of a Chinese-Western calendar translation table (Li, 1991). Thus

these data are not subject to the date shifting which is common in many surveys in
developing countries.

The data set for this study is a 10 per
cent of random sample of 2/1,000 Fertility Survey. We restrict our analysis to
births after 1949, ie., after the founding
of the People’s Republic of China. So we
have a total of 118,346 births (61,286
boys and 57,060 girls), contributed by
35,652 women. Of these 118,346 births,
6,909 died before their first birthday,
yielding the infant mortality rate as 58.4
per thousand. The infant mortality rates
for the four birth cohorts of the 1950's,
1960’s, 1970’s and the period 1980-88
are calculated as 112.9, 70.7, 48.5, and
40.4 deaths per thousand live births respectively, which are comparable with the
estimates by Tu (1989). This survey therefore has a size and quality which is
greatly superior to most surveys available
from developing countries.

To estimate the effects of sociodemographic variables on infant death, we use
a logistic regression model with the binary response variable: death or survival
within the first year (thus births in the 12
months before the survey are excluded,
and the remaining 114,337 births are used
for the logistic regression analysis). Selection of relevant independent variables
is guided by previous studies on the determinants of infant mortality and constrained by those that were included in the

survey. Therefore, we use the following .

variables: reproductive patterns—the age
of mother at birth of child, and previous
birth interval; socioeconomic variables—
urban-rural residence, mother’s education
and occupation, geographic region of residence, and ethnicity. Other control variables such as sex of child, month of birth
of child, and breastfeeding in the first year

of life were also included. Table 1 lists all
the variables included in the study together with their descriptive statistics.
These variables can be classified into
two main types: (1) categorical (ordered
or unordered) with multiple categories
such as geographic region of residence
or mother’s educational attainment, and
those which are binary variables such as
residence (urban/rural) or ethnicity (Han
majority/minority); (2) numerical variables, discrete, interval, or continuous,
such as year of birth for a child or age of
mother at the birth of a child. For binary
variables, a simple indicator or dummy
variable can be used to represent its effect
in a regression model. For example, in our
analysis sex of child is coded 1 if child is
a girl and 0 if a boy. We also use a dummy
variable to indicate whether the previous
birth died before the birth of the index
child. If the index child is a first child, the
dummy variable is coded as “no,” so this
variable differentiates between those cases
where the previous child died and all other
cases (however, we later include parity
zero as a dummy variable). Breastfeeding
is also coded as a dummy variable indicating whether a child was breastfed within
the first year of life. However, for the small
number of children who died in the first
month of life and who were not breastfed,
we assume that their death was not associated with lack of breastfeeding (which
would not necessarily be the case for
deaths beyond one month). Therefore we
code the breastfeeding variable in the first
month as “yes” for all children who died in
the first month, and this procedure will
produce a small conservative bias in estimated effect of breastfeeding on child survival. For coding non-binomial categorical
and numeric variables, we use the ACE algorithm described in the next section.

ACE GUIDED TRANSFORMATION
OF COVARIATES

In logistic regression analysis, the objective of fully exploring and explaining
the effect of covariates on the log-odds
of event occurrence is facilitated by properly coding the independent variables.
For a categorical variable, a conventional
way is to create a set of dummy variables,
but this is often done on an ad hoc basis.
It is possible to collapse some neighboring groups of the categorical variable, but
we don’t know how to find the most efficient cutting points. In terms of a numeric
variable, we usually have no prior knowledge or consensus on whether it should be
entered in the logistic model in a simple
linear form or in a transformed one, which
could be a straightforward polynomial
form, such as linear and squared terms, or a
non-linear function which cannot be estimated directly. Sometimes we cut an interval variable into several groups and treat it
as a categorical variable, and if so, we again
have the problem with identifying the most
relevant class limits so that the newlycreated categorical variable can best represent the original interval variable.

Here we search for efficient transformations using the ACE (Alternating Conditional Expectation) algorithm (Breiman
and Friedman, 1985; De Veaux, 1989), a
technique originally developed for finding nonparametric transformations of
both the independent and dependent
variables in multiple linear regression
such that the relationship between them
is as linear as possible, an approach
which can also be extended to generalized linear models (Raftery and Richardson, 1996). The ACE results can be used
to indicate if transformations are necessary and, if so, to suggest empirically

Wang and Murphy

Social Biology

meaningful parametric or nonparametric
transformations for use in logistic regression. However, we do not actually
use the nonparametric transformations
estimated by ACE in their raw form but
find functional approximations to them
which we then estimate.

This approach is implemented using
the ace and avas functions in the S-PLUS
statistical package for multiple linear regression (Venables and Ripley, 1994) and
the ace.logit' function for logistic regression (Raftery and Richardson, 1996). To
apply the ACE algorithm to possibly recode an independent variable, an examination of the scatterplot of the original
values against the ACE transformed values may give insight into the nature of an
approximately optimal transformation.
For example, if the plot is judged linear, a
linear model with the original data is appropriate; if not, it suggests an idea of
what kind of transformation should be
employed. Possibilities include power
and log transformations, threshold and
piecewise linear functions, categorical
(i.e., piecewise constant) transformations,
and quadratic or higher order polynomial
terms. If the suggested transformations
have the form of a threshold effect, where

the nature of the relationship between the

response variable and covariate changes
beyond a particular point threshold value,
we may then consider recoding the variable into piecewise linear or sometime
categorical variables. It is often possible
that there are a number of potential candidates for transformation of a variable. To
select the best transformation, we use
the BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)

'ace.logit can be obtained free of charge by sending
the e-mail message “send ace.logit from S” to
statlib@stat.cmu.edu.

because most models considered here are
non-nested and this statistic has been
demonstrated to be a good index for
comparing non-nested models (Raftery,
1995). The BIC statistic, originally derived from a Bayesian approach to statistical inference, can be expressed as:

BIC = —X? + plogN

where X? is the likelihood ratio test statistic for comparing the null model without
covariates with model of interest, p is the
number of independent variables in the
model of interest, and N is the sample
size, which in our case is the number of
cases in the logistic regression. The
smaller BIC is, the better the model. How
ever, to test the differences between

nested models, we use the conventional
likelihood ratio statistic.

CODING THE TIME PERIOD VARIABLE

To illustrate the use of the ACE algorithm, we first apply it to recode the year
of birth of child (.e., time period). We
show in the next step how ACE is used to
guide the transformation of period and
how BIC is used to select its best transformation. The same procedure is extended
to recode other independent variables.

We undertake the transformation of
time period in two steps. First we use the
ACE algorithm to get a transformed function of period and plot this against the
original period. The result is shown in
Figure 1. Secondly, based on this estimated pattern, we then try different transformations of period and select the best
one according to BIC.

The ACE result in Figure 1 suggests a
transformation with a threshold at a certain year c, where c appears to be around
1970. It also suggests at least five possi
Infant Mortality 27

ble transformations for period: (1) a
piecewise linear spline with a node at c;
(2) a linear variable before c and a constant value (dummy variable) after c; (3)
a simple straight line over the whole period; (4) a quadratic curve; (5) an exponential function. The BIC statistics corresponding to five types of transformations
are presented in Table 2.

Table 2 shows that all the specifications proposed are statistically significant according to chi-square statistics.
However, we cannot judge the relative
goodness-of-fit of those transformations
using these chi-square statistics because
the models are non-nested. For this purpose, we resort to the use of BIC statistics. According to BIC, the spline functions fit better than others, with the
simple linear variable for period effects
having the worst fit. Of three spline functions, the spline with a node at year 1971
has the lowest BIC score, so it is the best
specification of the time period effect of
child’s dying in the first year. This coding
can be expressed as:

year I = year-1950 for birth year = 1971
and 2] (i.e., 1971 —1950) otherwise
year 2 = 0 for birth year = 1971 and

year-197] otherwise.

Although the statistics presented in
Table 2 demonstrate the relative goodness
of fit among the models, they do not provide information about the absolute fit of
the models. To compare the goodness-offit of the untransformed period (i.e., linear)
model with that of the best coding (i.e.,
linear-spline model), Figure 2 is given to
show the estimated log odds of infant mortalities from 1950-1987 (dots) and their
approximate 95 per cent confidence intervals, the linear fit, and the linear-spline fit.

It shows that the spline curve as suggested by the ACE plot and BIC statistics
fits the period effects very well, lying
within or very close to all the confidence
intervals, whereas the simple linear fit
lies outside the confidence intervals at
several time points. The result suggests
the statistical efficiency of the ACE

guided transformations.”

?The figure indicates that there was elevated mortality in the period 1958-1961 associated with the Great
Leap Forward, but our main interest is in long-term
trends and their specification.

CopING OTHER COVARIATES

We now turn to coding other variables |
using the ACE algorithm. So far, we have
considered the ACE guided transformation
just for one independent variable, namely

time period. The plots of the transformed
variables against the original ones are shown
in Figure 3 for the variables; maternal age,
length of previous birth interval, mother’s educational achievement, mother’s occupation,
geographic residence of child, and month
of child’s birth. Using analyses similar to
those used for coding the period variable,
the following choices were made.
Maternal age.—The relationship between the original and transformed age
roughly exhibits a “U” shape in Figure 3.
However, the transformed value for age
less than or equal to 15 is extremely high,
suggesting a possible dummy variable for
age - 15. The curve is rather flat about between age 20 to 39. So the following possible transformations are proposed: (1) a
quadratic curve for the entire age span; (2)
a dummy for age - 15 and a quadratic
function for age £15; (3) three splines: linear for age H20, constant (dummy variable) for age 20 to 39, and linear for age
= 39. After calculating the BIC statistics
for these three suggested models, the first
specification had the lowest BIC score, so
we estimate maternal age plus age squared
as the best specification of the relationship

between maternal age and her child’s death
in the first year of life. The best parametric
transformation of age effect can also be determined by using a Box-Cox method
(Box and Cox, 1964; De Veaux, 1989). As
an exploratory analysis, this study did not
perform such analysis here.

Birth Interval.—The plot of the transformation of previous birth interval clearly
suggests that a dummy variable is needed
to represent the first birth, which does not
have a birth interval associated with it. For
other parities, it confirms that the risk decreases smoothly with duration and suggests a possible logarithmic transformation.
for birth intervals. (in fact, we use the
length of the birth interval minus eight
months to allow for the period of gestation
in our models and charts. We do not separate out multiple births, and the birth interval in such cases is taken as that since the
last maternity.) BIC statistics show that a
dummy variable for the first birth and algorithmic dependence on the previous birth
interval for the rest can best describe the
effect of this variable on infant mortality.

school graduation (25.5 per cent), junior
middle (13.1 per cent), and senior middle
and above (5.8 per cent). These grades were
coded as successive integers. The transformed variable exhibits a linear pattern
with this original coding, so education is
the only categorical variable which does
not need to be transformed, and it is entered
in the analysis as a simple linear variable.
Occupation refers to current or recent
employment of the mother and was coded
in five categories: (1) agriculture (76.2 per

(3.0 per cent), (4) Government or Professional jobs (3.2 per cent), (5) others (mainly
unemployed and students) (12.1 per cent).

After a number of experiments, we obtained
the lowest BIC score by simply reclassifying the occupation into two broad categories: industry/service/professional and
agriculture/ other.

Region of residence.—There are three
municipal cities and 26 provinces in this
survey. In order to simplify the presentation,
we have grouped the three metropolitan
cities into one group, and the 26 provinces
into 6 large geographic areas as follows: (1)
Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin; (2) North;
(3) Northeast; (4) East; (5) South; (6) Southwest; (7) Northwest. The ACE plot for the
transformation of this variable suggests
some possible regrouping: Regions 1 and 3
have about the same transformed values and
so do Region 2 and 4. BIC statistics show

that combination of Regions | and 3 as well
as Regions 2 and 4 are satisfactory codings
for representing the differentials in the logodds by region of residence.

Season (month of birth) is coded with
twelve integers from 1 to 12, representing
from January to December. The ACE plot
suggests dividing the whole year into two
broad seasons: (1), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (e.,
Spring and Summer) and (2) 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 1 (i.e., Autumn and Winter), and this
coding, according to the BIC criterion, accounts for most of the variability.

RESULTS

Table 3 presents a series of six logistic
regression models of infant mortality
with increasing numbers of covariates
which have been identified as likely to be
associated with infant mortality (Mosley,
1984). Model O is presented for completeness, since these time trends reflect
not only changes in infant mortality, but

_ also the sample design which truncates

the experience of older women in the
early years; Model 1 includes a control
for age and therefore represents the “simple” gross time period effect; Model 2
presents estimates of demographic determinants of infant death; Model 3 contains
estimates for the socioeconomic variables; Model 4 includes estimates for demographic and socioeconomic variables;
and finally Model 5 presents the full
model. These models are organized so as
to address a number of important questions by comparison of different models.
First, a comparison of Model] 1 with
other models can inform us of the extent
to which the infant mortality decline between 1950 and 1988 can be explained
by the changes in reproductive patterns,
socioeconomic developments, and other

Infant Mortality 31

variables. The coefficients for the two
linear variables representing the year
of child’s birth in Table 3 approximately
reflect annual relative changes in the
log odds of infant mortality for periods 1950-1971 and 1972-1988. Model
1 shows a substantial decline (about 5
per cent annually) in the log odds during 1950-1971 but the pace of decline
slowed down (to about 2 per cent annually) during 1972-1988. After adding the
full set of independent variables to Model
1, the two slopes of the period variables
in Model 5, as in all the intermediate
models, remain almost unchanged and
still statistically significant, suggesting
that the decline in the infant mortality be
tween 1950 and 1988 cannot be ex
plained by changes in these sociodemographic variables included in this study.
Indeed, the time period effect is slightly
stronger in Model 5 than in Model 1.
Thus, there are other factors which
played an important role in the mortality
decline. There is no doubt that the Chinese government made great progress
in the reduction of infant mortality
soon after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Cessation of warfare, maintenance of public order, redistribution of agricultural land,
movement of grain to deficit areas, and
massive concentration on preventive public health measures were examples of
political and macro-socioeconomic factors which contributed to mortality decline (Banister, 1987). As Banister (1987)
pointed out, there are a number of specific
reasons for such a spectacular drop in infant mortality during the 1950’s. Training
midwives probably had a substantial impact in reducing neonatal tetanus and
other infections linked with non-sterile
childbirth conditions. Relatively stable

nutritional conditions for mothers probably helped them in breastfeeding their babies. The emphasis on environmental
sanitation and control of pests starting in
1952 also reduced the incidence of fatal
diseases among infants. Epidemic-control
measures might be another factor in lowering infant mortality.

Second, comparison of Models 2 and 4
provides a means to assess the extent to
which the impact of demographic variables
are altered by the socioeconomic determinants of infant mortality. The results show
o that the coefficients of the demographic covariates do not change very much after introducing the socioeconomic variables, indicating that demographic determinants
operate directly on infant mortality.

Third, the full model shows the direct
net effects of the full set of sociodemographic covariates. Model 5 suggests that

DEMOGRAPHIC DETERMINANTS

All the reproductive variables included
are strongly related to the risk of infant
© death, and their coefficients are in the ex= pected direction and statistically signifi© cant. Many previous studies have a U© shaped relationship between mother’s age
at the birth of child and infant mortality
(Pebley and Stupp, 1987; Retherford et
al., 1989; Koenig et al., 1990). This finding is strongly confirmed by the results
from this study. The significance and
signs of the two maternal age coefficients
indicate that the highest risk of mortality
during the first year of their lives is found
for the children of mothers at youngest
and oldest ages. Parity, which is another
important reproductive variable but high
wnloaded by [Univers

Social Biology

ly correlated with mother’s age, is omitted in the model.

A consistent finding in the literature
is that longer birth interval improves the
child’s survival chance (Gray, 1981;
Trussell and Hammerslough, 1983; Hobcraft et al., 1985; Pebley and Stupp, 1987;
Retherford et al., 1989; Das Gupta, 1990;
Koenig et al., 1990; Miller et al., 1992).
There are four main explanations for why
shorter birth interval may be associated
with increased risk of infant death: (1) a
short birth interval depletes the ability of
the mother’s body to recuperate, thereby
possibly affecting the succeeding infant’s
health (Palloni and Millman, 1986); (2) a
short preceding interval may be indicative
of a premature birth, rather than reflecting
a causal relationship (although the presence of a young infant may exacerbate the
problems in coping with a premature
baby); (3) a closely following birth may
lead to competition for resources among
siblings; and, (4) increased likelihood of
transmission of infectious diseases between sibs close in age.

The estimates and significance of the
two birth interval variables in Model 2 remain unchanged after introducing other
controlling variables in Model 5, suggesting that previous birth interval is a factor
with the strongest and direct effect on infant mortality in China over this period.
First births have a lower infant mortality
rate than second or higher parity births.
The odds of dying in the first year for the
first child is 22 per cent lower than the
value for a subsequent birth occurring at
the median birth interval of 23 months |
since the previous birth (i.e., exp(—2.055)/
exp{ —0.667*]n(23—8)}=0.78). This finding is consistent with the result from Tu’s
study of the covariates of child mortality
in Shaanxi and Shanghai of China (Tu,

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 45, No. 1-2

1989). A possible reason for this finding
is that the first child has the advantage of
having no previous sibling to compete
with for parents’ attention and resources.
Cultural factors may also contribute to the
lower mortality of first births in China
(Tu, 1989). In China, the birth of the first
child is a very important event for a family, and the first child usually enjoys much
more attention and care than others. Also,
Chinese grandmothers generally play a
very important role in taking care of their
grandchildren, especially in rural areas.
Their involvement, advice, and supervision can overcome some of the disadvantages that first births encounter because of
physiological difficulties in delivery and
their mother’s lack of previous childbearing and care experience (Tu, 1989).

To interpret the effect of the preceding birth interval, we select three birth intervals: 20, 30, and 40 months and calculate the corresponding odds relative to that
for a 10-month interval; the values are
0.303, 0.202, and 0.157, respectively.
There are much larger differences between
the odds for a 10-month birth interval and
the rest than the differences between intervals longer than 20 months. This finding
indicates that birth intervals less than 20
months are associated with relatively high
risk of infant death, and this would appear
to be an appropriate point at which to form
a boundary in categorical analysis.

The survivorship of the preceding child
is consistently reported to have an 1mportant role to play in survival of index child.
First, survivorship of the preceding child
may affect postpartum amenorrhea and
therefore have an influence on the preceding
birth interval (Pebley and Stupp, 1987);
Retherford et al., 1989; Das Gupta, 1990).
Thus, controlling for survivorship of preceding child can also reduce bias to the esti
 

Infant Mortality | 35

mated effect of previous birth interval. Second, there may be a family clustering effect
on infant mortality due to a variety of biological and social factors such as a tendency
for some mothers to experience repeated
complications of pregnancy or premature
births, or a tendency to repeat unhealthy
childbirth practices such as unhygienic care
of the umbilical cord (Pebley and Stupp,
1987; Das Gupta, 1990). So survivorship of
the preceding child serves as a partial control for previous child mortality within the
family. The results show that there is strong
evidence of familial association in infant
mortality in China. The odds of dying in the
first year is 54 per cent higher for a child
whose preceding sibling died before his/her
birth compared to children with the same
values of the other covariates, but whose
preceding sibling survived.

SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS

Comparison of Models 3, 4, and 5
shows that the socioeconomic variables
selected in this study have a statistically
significant and direct impact on infant survival after controlling for demographic
and other variables. Living in an urban
setting is assumed to have a positive impact on child health through a variety of
factors, such as better access to medical
services, even after controlling for factors
such as the generally superior educational
and occupational composition of urban
populations. This is indeed true in China
where cities are usually equipped with
advanced medical facilities and have a
good public health system. It is no surprise that the children in rural areas have
a significantly higher chance of dying in
the first year of their lives than their urban counterparts with otherwise similar
characteristics. Education has always been
a key variable in the demographic studies

 

 
 

36 Wang and Murphy

of infant mortality (Trussell and Hammerslough, 1983; Hobcraft et al., 1985; Miller
et al., 1992). Education is assumed to affect infant health in several ways (Retherford et al., 1989). Well-educated women
probably have easier access to information on nutrition and health care. Education may also help in implementing medical advice. As such, education enhances
the efficiency of the process of producing

& children of mothers working in other sec§ tors, principally in agriculture. In terms of
A ethnicity, compared with the Han majority,
which accounts for over 93 per cent of the
total population, children of national minorities have a higher risk of infant death.
Although individual-level socioeconomic
variables have been controlled for, this result is probably related to the fact that
these national minorities tend to live in remote, underdeveloped frontier areas where
medical facilities are inferior.
There are also regional differentials in
infant mortality. Compared with the three

Univer

 

Social Biology

municipal cities (Beijing, Tianjin, and
Shanghai) and the Northeast region, the
other regions have higher infant mortality,
particularly the economically backward
Southwest region, which includes Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, which has
the highest odds of infant death, more than
twice the value of the most favored region.

OTHER CONTROLLING VARIABLES

The season (month in which a child
was born) also has an effect on infant mortality. Model 5 in Table 3 shows that children born in Spring and Summer have
lower odds of death in the first year of life
than children born in Autumn and Winter,
suggesting that infants born during the Autumn and Winter are exposed to some seasonally related diseases, although we have
no additional information on this aspect.

There have been inconsistent reports
on sex differentials in infant mortality
in developing countries. Some studies
showed that girls suffer excess mortality
in societies like India (Das Gupta, 1990),
whereas others reported the reverse
(Miller et al., 1992). This latter result is
also true in China and consistent with the
results from Ren’s study (1995, 1996) in
three provinces of China. Whether a child
is breastfed or not is also a very important determinant of child survival. A
child, if breastfed after birth, has much
lower infant mortality than one without
any breastfeeding. This finding is in conformity with most other studies (Retherford et al., 1989; Das Gupta, 1990; Miller
et al., 1992; Ren, 1995, 1996).

SUMMARY

This study analyzes the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of
infant mortality in China using the data

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

 

 

 

Vol. 45, No. 1-2

from the 2/1,000 Chinese Fertility Survey. We employed logistic regression to
examine the trends and differentials in infant mortality between 1950-1988. To
better describe the relationship between
risk of infant death and its determinants,
we used ACE algorithm for the transformation of independent variables. In conventional multivariate analyses of the determinants of infant mortality using event
history and logistic regression methods,
coding of independent variables has often
been done in a subjective way. Sometimes we have difficulty with deciding
whether a covariate should be treated as
categorical or interval; and if categorical,
what relevant class limits should be used
for cutting. This study has demonstrated
the procedures and usefulness of ACE algorithm for helping us in understanding
the relationship between independent
variables and infant mortality by guiding
us in choosing transformations in logistic
regression model analysis of infant mortality in China. We hope this analytical
tool will provide new encouragement for
the empirical modeling of social phenomena.

During the past several decades, China
has experienced a dramatic decline in infant mortality. We have attempted in this
study to decompose the declining trend in
infant mortality into parts that are attributable to changes in biologic factors, socioeconomic conditions, and other. We
find that the decline in infant mortality between 1950 and 1988 cannot be explained
by changes in these variables included in

‘the study. Thus, the unobserved social

changes that have occurred in China over
time have played an important role in improving infant survival. Those social
changes may be due to the influences accompanying the socioeconomic develop
 

Infant Mortality 37

ment and to the government intervention
policies in modernizing the country (Banister, 1987; Ren, 1996).

This study shows that after appropriate transformations, all the demographic
variables selected have statistically significant and direct influence on infant
death. We find that longer birth intervals
tend to lower the risk of child death. We
also find a significant effect of mother’s
age on the risk of mortality after controlling for other covariates. Our findings
yield some support for the notion that
family planning programs may contribute
to reducing infant mortality through increased mother’s age and birth spacing
(United Nations, 1994).

The study also finds that infant mortality in China is strongly related to the
mother’s socioeconomic characteristics.
Children of mothers living in rural areas,
with less education, engaging in agriculture work, and being members of national
minorities, have higher risk of dying during their first year of their life. There is
much to be done for the Chinese government to reduce infant mortality. Promoting
education of couples may reduce infant
mortality. Improvements in medical services in rural areas and for minority-populated areas would certainly further reduce
the overall level of infant mortality.
