Sample Size and the Interpretation

of Census Data

Secondary analyses of census materials
are important in many facets of research
in the social sciences. In a number of
cases, the data presented are based on a
sample from the total census of as few as
1 in 1,000 cases (Mitra, 1966a, 19668,
1966c, 1966d). These samples are assumed to be reliable, and considerable
confidence is placed in the acceptability
of such data for the valid description and
interpretation of social phenomenon, The
purpose of the present research is to test
the adequacy of the 1 in 1,000 sample by
comparing data based on it with similar

 

data based on a sample which is proportionately much larger.

Mitra (1966a) is concerned with the
childbearing patterns of American women.
Part of the presentation includes data on
the incidence of childlessness among
American women, based on a 1 in 1,000
sample of the 1960 United States census.
In order to test the extent to which data
based on a small sample can be used interchangeably with data based on larged
samples, parts of Mitra’s analysis were
reformulated, based on a sample fifty
times larger. As shown in Table 1, when

a sample of 50 in 1,000 is used some discrepancies can be observed.

When the sampling base is very large, as
it is for white wives over the age of 20,
virtually no discrepancies are found. However, when the sampling base is approximately one-tenth as large, as it is for
nonwhites compared with whites, the variation in percentages is consistently larger.
When the population to be sampled is still
smaller, as it is for wives under the age
of 20, the variation is quite substantial.
In comparing childlessness among young
wives, a sample of 1 in 1,000 would indicate only 15 percentage points difference
between whites and nonwhites; a sample
of 50 in 1,000 would indicate 21.5 percentage points difference, a variation of
over 6%.

How much importance can be attached
to variability in percentages? It is suggested that the significance of discrepancies between percentages is only partly
attributable to the absolute magnitude of
those differences. In some cases, even a
small variation may have a considerable
influence on the nature of interpretations
which may be offered. For example, consider the data in Table 2, which includes
the variable of duration of marriage!, and

1 Mitra’s categories for duration of marriage are
difficult to interpret, in that they are given as

which is thus relevant to an even smaller
population base. For nonwhite women
married 5-9 years, the variation in the
incidence of childlessness based on small
and large samples is only 5 percentage
points. However, this difference is the difference between the remarkably low estimate of maximum sterility of only 3.3%,
an incidence which is comparable with the
lowest rates reported anywhere in the
literature, and an estimate of 8.3% which,
although also low, is not unusual.
Furthermore, small absolute differences
in percentages may make significant substantive differences in the kinds of generalizations which are offered. Thus, on the
basis of a 1 in 1,000 sample, one might
conclude that: “Among women married
5 to 9 years aged 25-39, childlessness
among whites is from 6 to 10 percentage
points lower than childlessness among nonwhites. Among women either very young
(20-24) or very old (40-44), the relationship is reversed, with childlessness
being slightly higher among whites.’’ However, on the basis of a 50 in 1,000 sample,
one could justifiably conclude: “Among

follows: ~2 years, 2-5 years, 5-10 years, 10-15
years, 15-20 years, and 20-+ years (Mitra, 1966a,
p. 135). In what grouping does one place women
who have been married exactly 5 years or exactly
10 years? Private communication with Mitra
(June 9, 1971) confirmed our interpretation that
5-10 years means in fact 5-9 years inclusive.

women married 5 to 9 years, childlessness
is consistently lower among whites than
among nonwhites, with greater discrepancies being found in the older age groups.”

The use of the 1 in 1,000 sample for
the analysis of census data is undoubtedly
a legitimate and valid procedure for many
research designs. The purpose of the reanalysis of Mitra’s data is not simply to
reaffirm again the principle that large and
adequate samples are to be preferred to
small and inadequate ones. Rather, it is

Veevers 433

to illustrate the limitations of these samples for some specific kinds of analysis and
to reiterate again the need for caution in
the interpretation of data based on the 1
in 1,000 sample, especially when the base
population to be sampled is relatively
small and the absolute differences among
percentage points are not large.
