All mammalian infants possess the ability to metabolize lactose, a complex sugar
which occurs naturally only in milk, (Hazid
and Ballou, 1957). Absorption of lactose
is made possible by the presence in the
jejunum and other portions of the small
intestine of the enzyme lactase. Lactase is
responsible for converting lactose from an
unabsorbable disaccharide into two absorbable monosaccharides, glucose and
galactose. Ingestion of lactose by a lactasedeficient individual characteristically gives
rise to symptoms of gastric distress, including gas, cramps, and diarrhea. There is one
exception in the mammals, the California
sea lion (Zalophas californianus), which
has no lactose in the milk and whose pups
are lactase deficient (Kretchmer and Sunshine, 1967).

Most mammals do not retain the ability
to metabolize lactose beyond infancy,
however. In all nonhuman species investigated to date, lactase levels are uniformly
high throughout the period of high infantile maternal dietary dependence, but fall
rapidly some time prior to adulthood to

the point of lactase deficiency. Lactase
activity in suckling rats begins decreasing
at about fifteen to sixteen days following
birth (Rubino, Zimbalatti, and Auricchio 1964), and low levels of activity are
found after four weeks in the rabbit (Doell
and Kretchmer, 1962), after five weeks in
the pig (Walker, 1959), and after nine
months in the cow (Heilskov, 1952).

In man, the picture is somewhat different. Adults in some populations tend to be
lactase deficient and in other populations
the opposite is true. Populations with a
high incidence of lactase deficiency are:
Australian aborigines, 80-90% (Elliott,
Maxwell, and Vawser, 1967); Chinese,
Japanese, Filipinos, and Koreans, 95100% (Chung and McGill, 1968; Huang
and Bayless, 1968); American Indians,
67% (Welsh et al., 1967); the Baganda
of East Africa and Bantu of South Africa,
44-90% (Cook and Kajubi, 1966; Jersky
and Kinsley, 1967); American Negroes,
70-77% (Bayless and Rosensweig, 1966;
Cuatrecasas, Lockwood and Caldwell,
1965; Littman, Cady, and Rhodes, 1968;
Welsh et al, 1967); Eskimo (GudmandH¢yer and Jarnum, 1969); and New

Guinea natives (Bolin, Crane, and Davis,
1968).

Populations with a low incidence of
lactase deficiency are: Europeans and their
descendants (Bolin, Crane, and Davis
1968; Auricchio et al., 1963; Littman,
Cady, and Rhodes, 1968; Newcomer and
McGill, 1967; Welsh et al., 1967; Haemmerli et al., 1965; Cuatrecasas, Lockwood,
and Caldwell, 1965; Bayless and Rosensweig, 1966; Huang and Bayless, 1968;
Davis and Bolin, 1967; Sheehy and Anderson, 1965); and the Nilotic Negroes of
East Africa (Cook and Dahlquist, 1968;
Cook and Kajubi, 1966). The incidence
of lactase deficiency does not exceed 20%
in the above populations with one exception, England, with an incidence of 22%
(McMichael, Webb, and Dawson, 1966).
A most puzzling high incidence has been
reported from Israel: Sephardic Jews from
North Africa, 62.5%; Sephardi from other
areas, 72.2%; Ashkenazi Jews from Europe, 79.2% (Gilat et al., 1970). These
extraordinary findings from Israel will be
commented on later.

In man, no association has been found
between individual lactase levels and individual lactose intake (Chung and McGill,
1968; Cook and Kajubi, 1966; Welsh et
al., 1967; Flatz, Saengudom, and Sanguanbhokhai; 1969). Attempts to raise
lactase levels in deficient individuals have
failed (Cuatrecasas et al., 1965; Keusch,
et al., 1969a,b; Rosensweig and Herman,
1968). Cain et al. (1969) fed weanling rats
increasing concentrations of lactose, from
10% to 60%, and though the animals
experienced bowel distress and showed
other symptoms of lactose intolerance,
they grew in weight and at the seventh
week showed an increased lactase level
over the controls. One question arises.
Ts the lactase the infantile or the adult
form? Did Cain and his coworkers in
effect stimulate the falling infant lactase

level in the weanlings? As mentioned,
these tests have not been productive in
man. Thus, on the basis of these reports
and three family studies conducted among
Europeans and Thais (Ferguson and Maxwell, 1967; Fine et al., 1968; Flatz and
Saengudom, 1969), most researchers have
concluded that the trait has a_ strong
genetic component, with adult lactase production being dominant.

Given the pattern of distribution of
adult lactase deficiency in man, its presence in some populations and its absence
in many more, and accepting its genetic
base, though this has yet to be proved,
some interesting questions concerning selective pressures for man can be entertained. McCracken (1970) has offered an
explanation for the pattern of distribution.
Since milk is the only natural source of
lactose, it would be inefficient for an animal
to continue to produce lactase beyond the
period of infantile need. He further states
that prior to the domestication of dairy
animals and the introduction of lactose
into the adult diet, selective pressures
favored the more efficient lactase deficient
adult who did not waste precious metabolic
energy reproducing enzymes for which no
need existed. Pauling (1968) says that
natural selection will favor the organisms
that do not produce required metabolic
substances at optimal levels over those that
do. With the introduction of lactose into
the diets of some populations upon the
domestication of dairy animals, and the
growth of dependency of the adults on the
lactose, selective pressures would change
and favor the adult lactase producer.
These pressures continuing over sufficiently
long periods of time would account for the
incidence of lactase producers found in
modern populations. If this model is valid
and high levels of adult lactase sufficiency
are a result of dairy animal domestication,
and hence culturally based, then adult

nonhuman primates should be lactase deficient. Such a finding would suggest that
the trait, adult lactase sufficiency, is indeed a relatively new development in man’s
evolution. If, however, a large percentage
of adult nonhuman primates exhibit high
levels of lactase, this would suggest that
the trait goes much further back in primate evolution and probably is not culturally based.

The results of this investigation into the
levels of adult lactase in the owl, bonnet,
and rhesus monkeys show that these animals can be classified as adult lactase
deficient. Coupled with the pattern of
distribution of adult lactase sufficiency in
man, these findings tend to support the
contention that the high rates of this
enzyme in man are due to selective pressures brought about by the introduction
of lactose into the adult diet following the
development of dairy technology and
hence constitute an important example of
the interdependence of human biology and
culture.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Nine monkeys were tested for adult
lactase activity; seven owl monkeys (Aotus
trivirgatus), one bonnet monkey (Macaca
radiata), and one rhesus monkey (Macaca

Social Biology

mulatta). All specimens were certified to
be in good health at the time of sacrifice by the contributing research centers. The
seven owl monkeys came from the animal
colony of the University of California at
Los Angeles, and the two macaques from
the Center for Primate Biology at the
University of California at Davis. The
small intestines were excised at death,
packed immediately in dry ice and shipped
air express to the Laboratory of Physical
Anthropology at Idaho State University.
The specimens were placed in deep freeze
at —60° Centigrade until tested. The owl
and bonnet monkeys were kept for four
weeks at this temperature. It had been
hoped that more specimens would be forthcoming. The above eight specimens were
run as one group, and the ninth, the
rhesus, obtained at a much later date,
tested independently. The rhesus specimen
was kept at —60° for two weeks.

The mucosal layer of each specimen
was washed with PBS, then scraped, and
the wet weight taken before placing in
10 ml. of PBS. Break-up of the cells was
accomplished by alternate freezing and
thawing, three times. The method of
Dahlquist (1964) was followed in the assay of lactase activity (see Table 1). The
lactose substrate was prepared at 0.056

Molar concentration in 0.1 Molar maleate
buffer at a pH of 6.0. Then 0.1 ml. of
each specimen was tested without further
dilution as the expectation was that the
lactase activity would be low. The disaccharidase activity of the preparation analyzed is given by the following formula
of Dahlquist 1964:

RESULTS

Normal and abnormal lactase levels in
man have been described by Ferguson and
Maxwell (1967) who state that values beJow 1.0 unit per gram mucosa are definitely abnormal, and 1.0 to 1.4 units are
borderline. Knudsen et al. (1968), describing normal and abnormal values as
above and below 1.0 unit respectively, use
the same description of a unit as that of
Ferguson and Maxwell (1967); one unit
is one micromole of substrate hydrolyzed
per minute per gram of wet weight of tissue. Both the above papers say they used
Dahlquist’s method in which the incubation time is one hour and not intervals
thereof. To express results in terms of
“substrate hydrolyzed per minute” would
necessitate fractional incubation to know
the precise end-point. Hence, the lactase
activity values in these two papers should

be much higher if given for the incubation
time of one hour as described in Dahlquist’s technique. This makes the low

values obtained in this study even more

significant. The range of activity obtained
was from 0.07 to 0.74, indicative of lactase
deficiency.

Specimens one through eight were kept
for four weeks at —60° Centigrade. Could
enzyme activity have taken place in that
time? Reiner and Patterson (1966) say
that enzyme activity is not modified by
freezing. Cain et al. (1969) state they had
previously determined that enzymes did
not change when kept in a deep freeze
over a period of weeks.

CONCLUSIONS

Lactase activity in the bonnet, owl, and
rhesus monkeys were low, ranging from
0.07 to 0.74 units of activity. The smallness of the sample, only one specimen each
for two species, make the deductions
claimed earlier, that nonhuman primates
as a group are lactase deficient, only suggestive at best.

For the present, it would appear that the
findings do suport McCracken’s theory
(1970) that the high rates of adult lactase
sufficiency are due to selective pressures
created by the introduction of lactose into
the diet following the adoption of dairy
technology. If culture has acted as a selective milieu for natural selection, this most
modest study when expanded could serve
as an example and point the way to similar examples, particularly in those areas
dealing with the relationships between diet,
culture, and selection and those between
disease, culture, and selection.

Gilat et al. (1970) have offered some
findings that are inexplicable in light of
what is known about the long period of
the European base of the Ashkenazi and
Sephardic Jews. They admit this was a
hospital population and not a random

population sample and that Jewish groups
in the United States and elsewhere should
be sampled.

Baker (1966) offers two perspectives of

study on the problem of variability in human population genetic structure and their
adaptive significance. The second perspective, the demonstrable adaptive value of
specific genetic variation in man, would
appear to summarize the implications of
this study. A new food source appears and
those individuals in a population who by
their genetic endowment can avail themselves of this new item apparently do so.
Selection for this gene would be intense,
and over the thousands of intervening

years one could expect a rapid rise in the
incidence of this gene.
