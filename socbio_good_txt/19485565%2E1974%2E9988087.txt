Tobacco Smoking and Sex Ratios
in the United States

Robert D. Retherford

East-West Population Institute
Honolulu, Hawai

In the United States, as in other industrialized countries, summary measures of
the sex mortality differential, covering all
ages and causes of death, have greatly increased during the twentieth century at
the same time that mortality for both
sexes has declined sharply. Over the period
1910-62, for example, the female-male difference in life expectancy increased from
3.6 to 6.6 years (Retherford, 1972, p. 206;
Keyfitz and Flieger, 1968, p. 17). This
change produced lopsidedly feminine sex
ratios and high rates of widowhood at the
older ages, a social problem aggravated by
the fact that the aged increased greatly as
a proportion of total population and continue to increase as fertility continues to
decline.

The impact of smoking on the sex mortality differential has been examined by
Enterline (1960), Preston (19705 and
1970c), and Retherford (1972), and its
contribution to excess widowhood has been
examined by Grannis (1970) and Retherford (1973). These investigations all show
that the impact of smoking is substantial.
The present paper examines the related
problem of the effect of smoking on agespecific sex ratios. First, the trend in agespecific sex ratios is analyzed in terms of

 

movements of age- and sex-specific mortality rates, without reference to smoking.
In the final section, overall age- and sexspecific mortality rates are split into nonsmoking and smoking components, and the
analysis is extended to examine the effects
of smoking.

ANALYSIS OF TRENDS IN STATIONARY
POPULATION SEX RATIOS

The stationary population model provides a convenient tool for the analysis of
age-specific sex ratios (Yerushalmy, 1943).
A distinct advantage of stationary population sex ratios over actual ones is that the
former depend only on current age-specific
mortality. Unlike sex ratios in the actual
population, they are unaffected by past
histories of mortality, fertility, and migration. Moreover, they are the same as sex
ratios in the corresponding stable population, so that they represent the long-term
outcome of current mortality, regardless of
future fluctuations in fertility. For these
reasons, stationary population sex ratios
offer an excellent avenue by which to study
the long-term effects of current mortality
on sex ratios at each age.

It must be pointed out, however, that
although stationary and stable population

238

Vol. 21, No. 1

sex ratios are identical for age groups of
infinitesimal width, the correspondence is
only approximate for intervals of finite
width, as can be seen from the following
formulae for the sex ratio in the age group
x to x-+ 5. The stationary population sex
ratio equal

7+5 o+5
105f I™(u)du/f V(u)du

and the stable population sex ratio equals
e+5 e+
105f e-™il™(u)du/f e—™l (u)du,
a x@

where the male/female sex ratio at birth
is taken as 1.05, 2(u) is the continuous
representation of the persons-living column
of the life table, and ry is the intrinsic rate
of natural increase. It is apparent that for
finite but not for infinitesimal age intervals, stable population sex ratios depend
on the level of fertility as well as mortality,
since in the finite case the factor e~™ does
not cancel and in the infinitesimal case it
does.

If the age interval of integration is large,
as in the case of the total sex ratio, and if
the intrinsic rate 7 is also large, then the
gap between stationary and stable population sex ratios may be considerable. For
example, for a Coale and Demeny (1966)
stable population model West level 21,
with a female life expectancy of 70 years,
the total sex ratio is 0.990 for an r of zero
and 1.020 for an 7 of 0.03. Since sex ratios
for infinitesimal age groups have the advantage not only of describing exactly
both stationary and stable populations but
also of being easier to work with mathematically, they will be used exclusively in
this paper.

The left third of Table 1 shows the
overall trend in age-specific stationary
population sex ratios at selected ages in
the United States for 1910 and 1962. The
same values are graphed in Figure 1. The

Smoking and Sex Ratios

 

29

table and graph show that sex ratios increased at all ages below 58.9 (obtained
by linear interpolation between ages 55
and 60) and decreased at all older ages.
The age at which the sex ratio reaches
unity, starting from 1.05 at birth, increased
from 37.2 to 47.6 (values again obtained
by linear interpolation). The increases in
sex ratios below age 58.9 occurred in spite
of increases in male/female ratios of agespecific mortality rates, shown in the middle third of Table 1, that were even more
pronounced at the younger ages than at the
older ages. Male-female differences in agespecific mortality rates, on the other hand,
decreased at the younger ages, especially
in the first year of life, and increased at
the older ages, as shown in the right third
of Table 1. It is apparent that the trend
in sex mortality differences reflects better
the trend in sex ratios than does the trend
in sex mortality ratios.

The mathematics of the stationary population model is useful for analyzing more
precisely the relationship between these
various trends. Consider the sex ratio for
an infinitesimally small age group at age x
and denote it by S(x). We have that

where 1” and M/ are the observed agespecific mortality rates and Aj is the width
of the ith age interval, and where the summation is understood to cover the conventional abridged life table age intervals.
From (2) and (3), we have the following
criteria to tell us whether or not the sex
ratio at age x is less than, greater than, or
equal to one:

If (CMR™ — CMR‘)

<1n(1.05), then S(x) > 1.
If (CMR™ — CMR’)

= 1n(1.05), then S(x) = 1.
If (CMR™ — CMR‘)

> 1n(1.05), then S(x) < 1.
(4)

It is evident from (4) that a change in
the sex ratio at birth would cause the age
at which the sex ratio reaches unity to
move in the same direction, in accordance
with common sense. This is not a purely
academic consideration, because if parental
choice of sex of child ever becomes a
reality, substantial variations in the sex
ratio at birth could conceivably occur.
Equation (1) shows that alteration of the
sex ratio at birth would alter sex ratios at
all subsequent ages in the same proportion.

We can also derive the conditions under
which S(x +) will be less than, greater
than, or equal to S(x). We have that

S(x -- n) — S(x)
~ 1.05 exp(— J” (wma) — p(w) du) —

1.05 exp(— f (w"(u) — w(u))du).
(5)

Set equal to zero, (5) reduces to

f" (um(u) —wlw))du=0. (6)

In discrete terms this becomes approximately

(7)

The following criteria therefore indicate
how the sex ratio will change between ages
x and x-+ 2.

M"™— MI,

If Mm" <M! then S(x +”) > S(x).

If Mm" — M’, then S(x-+ 2) = S(x).

If Mn" > M!, then S(x-+ 2) < S(x).
(8)

These criteria, in contrast to those in (4),
are independent of the sex ratio at birth.
The criteria in (4) and (8) help to explain variations in sex ratios by age. Related criteria can be derived concerning
variations over time. Consider a change
between times ¢ and #’. We have that

Scary (%) — Sty (x)
= 1.05 exp(— f (uw (47) (22)
— Wer) (1) )d)
— 1.05 exp(— j (1 (2) (12)
— phe(u))du). (9)

Set equal to zero, (9) reduces to
J (wear (24) — Bier (tt) ed

= Sn" (u) — WW (2)(u))du (10)
or, equivalently,
ACMR™ —ACMR’. (11)

The following criteria therefore indicate
the direction of the change over time in
the sex ratio at age x:

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

32 Retherford

If ACMR™ < ACMR’,

then S(x) increases.
If ACMR”™ = ACM Ri,

then S(x) is unchanged.
If ACMR™ > ACMR’,

then S(x) decreases.
(12)

These criteria are also independent of the
sex ratio at birth.

Table 2 verifies that the criteria in (4),
(8), and (12) predict the movements in
sex ratios over age and time shown earlier
in Table 1 and Figure 1. For convenience,
the sex mortality differences in Table 1 are
reproduced in the first two columns of
Table 2. The upward shift in the age at
which (CAZR™ — CMR’) reaches In (1.05)
(equal to 0.0488, or 48.8 per thousand)
corresponds to the upward shift in the age
at which the sex ratio reaches unity. All

Social Biology

the values of ("— MM‘) are positive,
and they correspond to monotonic decreases in sex ratios over age. And the
sign of (ACMR™ — ACMR’) corresponds
to the reverse of the direction of change
over time in the sex ratio at the same age.
To summarize thus far, as age- and sexspecific mortality rates at the younger ages
declined to nearly zero between 1910 and
1962, most male-female differences between those rates also declined, especially
for the first year of life. As a result, sex
ratios at the younger ages decreased more
slowly with age in 1962 than in 1910, and
the male advantage in births was preserved
to a more advanced age. This is the common .sense meaning of the decreases over
time in (CMR™ — CMR’) at the younger
ages and the increase in the age at which
(CM R™ — CMR!) reaches In (1.05).
The female-male difference in life expectancy increased in spite of these trends,
because the declines in sex mortality dif

ferences at the younger ages were more
than offset by much larger increases at the
older ages. These offsetting effects are
analyzed in an earlier paper, in which the
increase in the female-male difference in
life expectancy between 1910 and 1965 is
decomposed into a sum of contributions
from mortality changes in each age group.
This decomposition shows negative contributions at the younger ages and large offsetting positive contributions at the older
ages (Retherford, 1972).

The increases at both young and old
ages in male/female mortality ratios are
of course quite compatible with the trends
in age-specific sex ratios and male-female
mortality differences. Sex mortality ratios
and sex mortality differences can easily
move in opposite directions if mortality
for both sexes is falling (the point is easily
proved algebraically, but is also illustrated
numerically in Tables 1, 2, and 4), and we
have seen in any case from equations (1)
through (12) that age-specific sex ratios and
changes in them depend directly on sex
mortality differences and not at all on sex
mortality ratios. Bowerman (1950) and
Sowder and Bond (1956) also recognized
that sex ratios could increase in a situation
of falling sex mortality differences and
rising sex mortality ratios at the younger
ages, although neither analyzed the problem mathematically.

EFFECT OF TOBACCO SMOKING
ON SEX RATIOS

Between 1910 and 1962, average annual
cigarette consumption per person aged 15
and over increased considerably in the
United States, from 49 cigarettes in 1910
to 3,958 in 1962. Consumption of pipe,
cigar, and chewing tobacco decreased
sharply over the same period, so that the
increase in per capita consumption of all
forms of tobacco, from 7.42 pounds in
1910 to 10.85 pounds in 1962, was much

less marked than that of cigarettes (U.S.
Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare,
1964, p. 45). Since the available evidence
indicates that deaths from tobacco smoking stem mainly from cigarettes (U.S.
Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare,
1964, p. 85), the trend in cigarette consumption more accurately reflects the detrimental effects of smoking trends on
health than does the trend in overall tobacco consumption.

Two important studies demonstrate that
the increase in cigarette smoking has been
heavily concentrated among males. In 1955
the Bureau of the Census, on behalf of the
National Cancer Institute, carried out a
probability sample of the United States
population and found that 68.0 per cent
of men but only 32.4 per cent of women
had ever smoked cigarettes, and that among
nonsmokers 9.8 per cent of men but only
3.1 per cent of women had previously
smoked cigarettes regularly (U.S. Dept. of
Health, Education, and Welfare, 1956, p.
8). A subsequent study by the American
Cancer Society, which examined smoking
in relation to the death rates of one million men and women over the period 195964, generally verified the National Cancer
Institute findings, and in addition found
that male smokers inhaled more deeply
than female smokers and that they began
smoking at an earlier age (Hammond,
1966, p. 128).

The concentration of the upswing of
cigarette smoking and its mortality effects
among males produced a substantial impact
on the sex mortality differential. In the
United States in 1962, the middle year of
the American Cancer Society (ACS) study
mentioned above, all forms of tobacco
smoking combined accounted for about 47
per cent of female-male difference in life
expectancy between ages 37 and 87, and
about 75 per cent of the increase in the
female-male difference in life expectancy

34 Retherford

between ages 37 and 87 between 1910 and
1962 (Retherford, 1972). The related impact of cigarette smoking on the incidence
of widowhood was also severe. In the hypothetical stationary population of males
aged 39-88 and females 37-86 in the
United States in 1962, corresponding to
a couple life table of initially intact couples
who never divorce or remarry after death
of spouse, in turn based on average male
and female mortality in the ACS sample,
both the number and the proportion
widowed among females would have been
21.6 per cent less if no husbands had ever
smoked (Retherford, 1973). (These findings, as well as those presented below,
assume that the observed differences in
mortality rates for smokers and nonsmokers are almost entirely causal in
nature. For discussions of this assumption,
see Preston, 1970a and 19700 and Retherford, 1970, Chs. 2 and 5, and 1972.)

Since the sex mortality differential and
the incidence of widowhood are both closely
tied to the age pattern of sex ratios, it is
clear that the trend in smoking must have
had a substantial effect on sex ratios, too.
Grannis (1970), who also utilized data from
the ACS study, graphed male against female life table survivorship from birth to
each age for different levels of cigarette
consumption and found that this was indeed the case. (His results are somewhat
misleading, however, because of his erroneous implicit assumption that the sex
ratio at birth is one.) In this section, we
further investigate this question.

The age-specific mortality rates on which
the following analysis is based were derived by linearly interpolating and extrapolating mortality data given in the ACS
study for age groups 37-41, .... , 82-86
into the standard groupings 35-39,....,
80~84 and then combining these with
mortality rates for ages 0, 1-4, 5-9, ....,

Social Biology

30-34 for the United States in 1962 (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1968) to calculate life
tables and corresponding age-specific stationary population sex ratios. (In the ACS
study reports, the age range of mortality
data was labeled 35-84 but should have
been labeled 37-86, because age was tabulated as of the beginning rather than the
middle of the study.) These sex ratios are
treated as reasonably representative of sex
ratios in the stationary population corresponding to United States mortality in
1962, and they constitute a basis, since
they incorporate the ACS data, for investigating the effect of smoking on sex ratios.
It is assumed that the mortality effects of
smoking below age 35, the lower age limit
of the ACS data, are small enough to be
safely ignored.

Because of the somewhat unrepresentative nature of the ACS sample, this procedure does have some drawbacks. The
ACS sample was unfortunately not a probability sample of the United States population, although efforts were made to make
it as representative as possible. Data from
it are used here because they constitute
the only source of mortality data sufficiently detailed (specific for age, sex and
smoking status) for the life table techniques employed. The health of the sample,
as measured by its mortality experience,
was somewhat better than that of the
United States population in 1962, the
middle year of the study, due to underrepresentation in the sample of nonmarried
persons, hospitalized persons, and lower
socioeconomic groups (Hammond, 1969).
As a result, life expectancy between ages
35 and 85 was about two years higher and
the female-male difference in this life expectancy about 0.5 year higher in the
sample population than in the United
States population in 1962 (Retherford,
1972). Table 4 shows the corresponding

lation in 1962, even though the absolute
levels of these sex ratios are somewhat too
high.

Column 3 of Table 3 shows the per cent
reduction in sex ratios at each age from
what they would have been if the total
population had consisted entirely of nonsmokers. The reduction varies from zero
per cent at age 35 to 20 per cent at age 85.
It is apparent that smoking has a cumulative effect on the sex ratio with increase
in age.

The analysis of the previous section can
be extended to elucidate quantitatively the
nature of this cumulative effect. If x represents age and if age-specific mortality
rates are understood to pertain to five-year
age groups, then for each sex we can define,
following Preston (19702),

M* = annual age-specific mortality
rate of persons aged x tox +L 5,
M* = nonsmoking mortality
component of M7,
a __ . a
M* = smoking mortality
component of M7?,

(13)
where M7? and M% are obtained from the
ACS sample data, M* being the observed
age-specific rate for nonsmokers, and where
MS is obtained as (M7 ~ M*), From (1)
we have then that

SP(x) = 1.05 exp (— f (W'm(w)

+ ph (w)) — (w%(u) + w8!(u)) du).

With some manipulation this can be rewritten, with the aid of equations (2) and
(3) above, as

S?(x) = S¥(x)

exp(—-(CMRS" — CMR*®)), (15)
where S*(x), the sex ratio for nonsmokers,
iS
S*(x) = 1.05

exp(—(CMR*™" — CMR*l)), (16)

If we denote by R(x) the proportionate
reduction in the sex ratio from what it
would have been if the population had
consisted entirely of nonsmokers (column
3 of Table 3), then from (15)

R(x) = 1 '

— exp(—(CMRI”" — CMRY)), (17)
and (15) can be rewritten as
S?(x) = S¥(x)(1—R(x)). (18)

The R(x) calculated from (17) do not correspond exactly to the values in column 3
of Table 3. The discrepancy is less than
one per cent in all cases and is due to the
use of discrete approximations to the continuous model.

It is apparent from (17) that for
R(x) to increase with age, the quantity
(CMRS" — CMR*') must also increase
with age (columns 3 and 4 of Table 3).
For (CMR8" — CMR*) to increase with
age, it is necessary that MS" > M*! at all

ages (columns 9 and 10 of Table 4). We
are thus led to the following set of criteria,
analogous to (8) above, which indicate
how R(x) will change between ages x
and «-++ 2.

If Ms < M*!, then R(x) decreases.
If Ms" = M*!, then R(x) is unchanged.

tf MS" > Mt, then R(x) increases.

CONCLUSION

Earlier studies have shown that the upswing in cigarette consumption in the
United States in this century has been
responsible for most of the increase in
summary measures of the sex mortality
differential over the same period and that
it has also contributed substantially to the
current high incidence of widowhood among
older women. The present paper has analyzed the related problem of the contribution of smoking to imbalances in sex ratios
and found it also to be substantial.
