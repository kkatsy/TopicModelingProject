Childlessness: A Panel Study of Expressed Intentions

and Reported Fertility

ABSTRACT: The present research focuses on childed versus childless intentions and subsequent
behavior and intentions for a panel of U.S. women. Utilizing data from the 1970 and 1975
National Fertility Surveys (reinterviewed women), we ascertain the consistency between intentions (1970) and behavior and intentions (1975). We find that while women who expressed a
zero parity intention in 1970 were very consistent in their behavior and intentions in 1975,
nearly 30 per cent of those women intending children had no children by 1975. Furthermore, of
these 30 per cent, one-third had changed their intention to zero parity by 1975. We find that
changing intentions from more than zero to zero is associated with higher levels of education,
slightly higher income, and to a lesser degree with the importance given religion and with labor

force participation.

This study examines both expressed
intentions and the actual occurrence of
childlessness for a panel of U.S.
women. While intentions, behavior,
and the correlates of these intentions
and behavior patterns have béen the
main focus of the childlessness literature
(e.g. Bloom and Pebley, 1982; Poston
and Gotard, 1977), to our knowledge no
study has looked at intentions at one
point in time and ascertained the behavior of those same women at a later point
in time. Our goal here is to look at: (1)
how consistent women are with regard
to their expressed intentions for childlessness and subsequent behavior and
intentions, and (2) the sociodemographic characteristics of women who
express One intention or another at one
point in time, with special emphasis on
women whose intentions do not match
their behavior at some later point in
time. However, we first make a brief
presentation of recent trends in childlessness.

Childlessness in the United States has
varied considerably throughout this cen
tury. From World War I until World
War II childlessness tended to increase
(Veevers, 1979, p. 7). Between 1910
and 1940 the proportion of childless
ever-married women aged 15-44 in the
United States rose from 16 to 24 per
cent. However, from World War II until
the intensification of the Vietnam War
(1965) the rate of childlessness decreased to 14 per cent (Poston and Gotard, 1977). This rate was so low that
some researchers declared voluntary
childlessness to be virtually extinct
(Whelpton et al., 1966, p. 163; Westoff
and Westoff, 1971, p. 35). However as
Veevers (1980, p. 156) notes, this conclusion was premature since even at
their lowest point childlessness rates exceeded rates of sterility, leaving some
childlessness to be accounted for. And,
in fact, childlessness increased in the
1970’s. Most recent CPS data (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1980) show that
nearly 19 per cent of all ever-married
women aged 18-44 are currently childless.

Paralleling the increase in childless

ness during the 1970’s was an increase in
reported expectations of childlessness,
particularly among the younger cohorts
of women. Three per cent of white wives
aged 18-30 in 1969 expected to remain
childless. However, childless expectations increased to nearly 5 per cent by
1975 (Veevers, 1980, p. 156) and approximately 11 per cent by 1980 (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1980).
Nevertheless, predictions of childlessness or fertility in general based on
expectations are problematic because
“current expectations of births may or
may not be realized in actuality”
(Veevers, 1980, p. 156). This is evident
in a comparison of the expectations
mentioned above (3 per cent expected
no children in 1969) and the subsequent
rates of childlessness for the same group
of women. The actual rates of childlessness have been considerably larger. The
rate of childlessness for each five-year
cohort aged 18-49 1n 1970 was at least 6
per cent, much higher than the expressed intentions. Furthermore, the
lowest rate was that for one of the two
older groups of women included in the
1970 data (Poston and Gotard, 1977).
The increased rate of childlessness
can be seen in both cohort (e.g., Hastings and Robinson, 1974; Poston and
Gotard, 1977) and period rates (e.g.,
Das Gupta, 1975; DeJong and Sell,
1977). The cohort rates show that each
successive cohort of ever-married white
wives aged 15-19 from 1960 through
1975 had a higher prevalence of childlessness than the preceding 5-year cohort. For example, the cohort aged 1519 in 1975 had a 59 per cent childlessness
rate as compared to 54 per cent for the
cohort aged 15-19 in 1970 (Poston and
Gotard, 1977). The 1970 aged 15-19 cohort’s rate of childlessness was higher
than the 1965 rate. Though the rates for

 

 

Childlessness: A Panel Study 319

both cohorts both decreased over time,
the rate of childlessness for the 1970 cohort was still greater when aged 20-24
than the rate of childlessness for the
1965 cohort when it was 20-24. Likewise, the 1965 cohort maintained rates
of childlessness higher than the 1960 cohort at similar ages.

This information is important in considering the possibility that the high
rates of childlessness among presently
young wives is temporary, as some researchers predict (e.g., Blake, 1974).
However, as Glick (1975) notes, cohorts
which delay childbearing seldom
achieve the rate of fertility that would
have been expected if there had been no
delay. This is due to three interrelated
problems according to Veevers (1980, p.
32). One is the decline of fecundity with
increased age. That is, women who can
physiologically reproduce in their twenties may find that their fecundity has declined or been lost if they remain childless until their thirties, Another probJem is the fear many couples have concerning the positive relationship between the probability of a birth defect
and the age of the mother. The third
problem with delaying the birth of the
first child is the socially accepted belief
that older persons have a reduced tolerance for children. For these reasons
much temporary childlessness becomes
permanent. The result of this has been
increased childlessness.

An increase in childlessness can also
be seen by examining recent period
rates. DeJong and Sell (1977, p. 131)
show that the childlessness rate has increased for each group aged 15-30 since
1965. It can be assumed for each age
grouping that voluntary childlessness
has increased “‘since there is no reason
to expect an increase in sterility among
the younger populations” (Veevers,

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:39 08 December 2015

320

1980, p. 157). These data also lead us to
believe that presently temporary childlessness, to a substantial extent, will become permanent. Both expectation and
occurrence of childlessness are increasing according to available data.

In the following paragraphs, we study
a panel of U.S. women in order to find
out more about the linkages between intentions and subsequent behavior. Specifically, we would like to understand
better the process surrounding changes
in intentions—from childless to childed
and from childed to childless.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data sets utilized are the 1970
and 1975 National Fertility studies.
While a great deal of description concerning these data has already appeared
in print (c.f., Ryder, 1979; Jones and
Westoff, 1979), it should be recalled
that the 1975 National Fertility Survey is
longitudinal in design, that is, 2,361
women who were interviewed in 1970
were reinterviewed in 1975. In addition,
it is also possible to match persons records for 1970 and 1975 (different data
were solicited in each time period) so
that one file results in a great deal of
information. Of particular interest are
some of the restrictions of these data in
that: (1) only continuously married
white women are included in the sample; (2) both the husband and wife can
only be married once; (3) the duration
of marriage is less than 25 years and (4)
age at marriage is less than 25 years. All
of these restrictions contribute an unknown amount of bias in the sample.

Using both the 1970 and 1975 data
constitutes a panel study, though admittedly one with a fairly short duration.
Nevertheless, it should be emphasized
that childbearing occurs over a short

Pol

period of time. When we combine 1970
intentions with 1975 behavior and intentions for women who afe childless in
1970, in one sense the time interval increases. That is, in 1975 we have a measure of future intentions which from an
analytic standpoint increases the time
interval. Furthermore, as Veevers
(1980, p. 161) points out, if we are to
learn more about the dynamics of the
children or no children decision-making
process, a prospective cohort study is required. Despite its limitations, the data
set utilized in this study meets that requirement.

ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

In order to analyze the various
intentions-behavior categories of
women implied above, we borrow the
analytical framework created by Poston
and Kramer (1981), though for our purposes it is somewhat modified. Figure 1
shows the decision tree underlying this
framework. As can be seen, we begin
with 274 women who are childless and
not currently pregnant in 1970. These
women are subsequently divided into
their 1970 intentions, 1975 fertility behavior (i.e., have they had a child?), and
their 1975 intentions. Comparisons of
sociodemographic characteristics are
made at levels (1), (2), and (3) (numbers
in parentheses), though two cells are ignored due to their small n’s. Nevertheless, unlike Poston and Kramer (1981),
we make no distinction between voluntary and involuntary childlessness. Our
childless women include beth fecund
and infecund women, although if the
woman is infecund (not by choice), she
had to respond “no” to the question, “If
it were physically possible, would you
like to have a child?” in order to be included in the sample. Therefore, the
sample is reduced to 274. We are relying

on Veevers (1979, p. 4) notion that from
a sociological standpoint the essential
component in defining persons as voluntarily childless is not their biological status, but their psychic preference. However, we are also cognizant of the fact
that a woman’s physiological ability to
reproduce may affect her psychic preference.

RESULTS

Returning to Figure 1, we see that the
vast majority (85 per cent) of the women
who were childless in 1970 intended to
have children at some time. However,
by 1975 only 62 per cent of these women
had followed through on their intentions
and 9 per cent had changed their minds.

322

On the other hand, virtually all the
women (95 per cent) who in 1970 intended to remain childless in fact had no
children and intended no children in
1975. Furthermore, of the 65 women
who expressed an expectation for children in 1970, but had no children by
1975, one-third (22) had changed their
minds by 1975.

In sum, these data indicate that while
the intention to not have children is a
fairly stable one, the intention to have a
child is subject to change and even over
what might be considered a relatively
short time span. These data also add
some explanation to the previous finding that childless behavior exceeds
childless intentions by demonstrating
that a significant proportion of women
change their minds from expecting at
least one child to expecting none. Now
we turn to the sociodemographic characteristics which might lend some understanding to the pattern of intentions
and behavior just observed. The characteristics selected have been shown to be
correlates of childlessness in previous
cross-sectional research. Because of a
few nonresponses to questions concerning these characteristics, the n’s appearing in these tables are somewhat different from those appearing in Figure 1.
All of the correlates in this study come
from the 1970 person record.

Table 1 presents intentions and behavior cross-tabulated by respondent’s
age at marriage. Previous studies have
found a positive relationship between
age at marriage and childlessness (e.g.,
Veevers, 1971; Ritchey and Stokes,
1974); that is, women who marry later in
life when compared with those who
marry younger are more likely to bear
no children in their lifetime. The data
from Panel 1 of Table 1 are consistent
with this finding. Panel 2 subdivides

Panel 1 by adding the variable parity
1975. Only Columns 1, 2, and 4 are compared because of the small x for Column
3. As can be seen, women who intended
at least one child in 1970 are more similar in age structure to each other than to
women with a zero intention in 1970 regardless of 1975 fertility level. In other
words, the age structure for women who
did have at least one child in the 1970-75
interval versus women who did not is
“similar, given the same intention in
“1970. Concerning Panel 3, women who
<thanged intentions from some children
do zero children are more similar in age
tructure to those women who intended
ochildren in 1970 and still intend children
ain 1975 than they are to the zerocdntentions 1970 and 1975 women. Over“alll, the variable age at first marriage procvides little insight into the distinction
ebetween those women who are consist“ent versus those who change their minds
concerning their childbearing inten‘ions.
= Table 2 presents intentions and beavior cross-tabulated by respondents’
‘education. Prior research has shown
that actual and expected childlessness
‘dncreases with education (e.g., Panko,
972; Ritchey and Stokes, 1974). The
gesults presented in Panel 1 are consist"ent with these findings. The inclusion of
arity 1975, Panel 2, provides little inormation about the differences as
women with the greater than zero expectation are similar regardless of 1975
parity. However, in Panel 3 a different
pattern results. Those women who
changed their intentions between 1970
and 1975 have educational levels between the two groups of women who
were consistent in their intentions. So, if
we wished to predict which women with
expectations greater than zero would be
more likely to change their expectations

to zero, we would guess that it would be
those women with the highest education
levels.

Consistent with the findings of Poston (1974) and Wolowyna (1977), family income is found to be positively associated with childlessness intentions in
Table 3. In addition, small income differences emerge between categories in
panels 2 and 3. Within the category of
intentions greater than zero in 1970,
women still childless in 1975 have a
slightly higher income structure, and
women who changed intentions from
greater than zero to zero, have a somewhat higher income structure.

Panel 1 of Table 4 shows that as religious importance increases, childless expectations decrease though the differences are not large (see studies by
Gustavus and Henley (1971) and Poston
(1976) for varying results with different
operationalizations of religiosity). By
adding parity 1975, we see that those
women who intended children in 1970
but who had none by 1975 find religion
more important than the other two
groups of women. Focusing on intentions 1975, it can be observed that the
group of women who changed their intentions to zero children in the interval
are more like the zero-intentions 1970
and 1975 women with regard to the importance of religion than the greaterthan-zero-intentions 1970 and 1975
women. That is, if we were asked to predict which women who had intentions
greater than zero in 1970 would change
their intentions, we would guess that
they would be women who found religion less important.

Table 5 presents intentions and behavior cross-classified by employment
status—working or not working. Thirtysix cases are excluded because while the

she also answered “no” to the question
of whether she was bringing in any additional (in addition to the husband) income to the family. The data in Panel 1
do not support the finding of Ritchey
and Stokes (1974) and DeJong and Sell
(1977) that there is a positive relationship between labor force participation
and childlessness. There is virtually no
relationship between labor force participation and childless intentions. How= ever, again we are concerned with inten“ tions and behavior and not just behavior
itself. The same very small differences
5 appear in Panel 2, although in Panel 3
A relatively large differences emerge.
oo Women who changed their intentions in
a the 1970-75 interval are more heavily
oo concentrated in the working category.

but stated that they expected to have
children, had changed their expectations to zero in the time interval. Furthermore, it is likely that a substantial
proportion of the 43 childless 1975
women whose intentions are greater
than zero will change intentions as well.

With a relatively large number of correlates of childlessness have been uncovered in previous research, there are
fewer of those same correlates to the
changing of childless intentions. Changing intentions from more than zero to
zero children is associated with: (1)
higher levels of education; (2) a slightly
higher income; (3) a lesser degree of importance given to religion (4) labor force
participation.

Though several sociodemographic
variables have been shown to be correlates of intention changes in regard to
childlessness, the need to include these
variables in a multivariate structure is
extremely important. Unfortunately,
the current data set does not lend itself
well to such analysis. Return studies of
intention changes should focus on multiple correlates.
