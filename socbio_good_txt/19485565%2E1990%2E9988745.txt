Intra-ethnic and Inter-ethnic Marriage
and Divorce in Hawaii

Psychology and Behavioral Biology Laboratory, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii

ABSTRACT: A comparison of intra- and inter-ethnic divorce rates in Hawaii showed that
inter-ethnic marriages resulted in a higher proportion of divorces than did intra-ethnic
marriages when the marriage data used had to do with all marriages occurring in Hawaii.
However, a sizeable portion of marriages in Hawaii are of nonresidents who, if they divorce,
probably divorce elsewhere. Nonresident marriages are chiefly intra-ethnic marriages of
Caucasians. When examining the proportions of divorces to resident marriages, within-group
marriages are more at risk than inter-ethnic marriages. Asin prior research, persons who marry
members of other racial/ethnic groups tend to marry persons from groups with income levels
similar to their own. As in previous reports, some cross-ethnic combinations appeared more at
risk for divorce than did others. Group income appeared to be a predictor of risk. When
considering only resident marriages as related to divorces, those marriages in which the bride
was from a higher income group than the groom were at a significantly greater risk for divorce
than marriage in which the bride came from an income group lower than that of the groom.

Marriage and divorce patterns in Hawaii have been of interest to researchers
for the past fifty years (e.g., see Adams,
1937; Cheng and Yamamura, 1957;
Lind, 1964; Parkman and Sawyer, 1967;
Monahan, 1966; Schmitt, 1969; Leon,
1975; Schwertfeger, 1982; Johnson,
1984; Labov and Jacobs, 1986). Interest
has resulted in large part from the very
high rates of inter-racial and inter-ethnic
marriages in Hawaii as compared with
the rest of the United States. While
some of the authors cited above were
concerned with marriage, but not divorce, most of them presented data having to do with divorce as well. Three
generalizations can be made from those
reports that dealt with divorce: (1) interethnic divorce rates generally have been
higher than intra-ethnic divorce rates;
(2) differences in intra-ethnic and interethnic divorce rates appear to have decreased over time; and (3) some crossethnic marriage combinations are far

less likely to result in divorce than are
others.

The present paper will bring up to
date information concerning intraethnic and inter-ethnic divorce rates and
will contrast data derived from marriage
data having to do with all marriages as
opposed to resident marriages (one or
both members of the spouse pairs are
residents) as each set of marriage data
relates to divorce (resident only) data.
Further, this paper will provide an explanation for a significant portion of the
variance in resident marriage/divorce
rates across different combinations of
husbands and wives of Hawaii’s five major racial/ethnic groups—persons of
Caucasian, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian/part Hawaiian,' and Japanese ances

try. Analyses are limited to these five
groups because the next largest group
(Korean) in the nonmilitary population
still is only about 1 per cent of the population, and data from small groups will
tend to be unstable. These population
data are shown in Table 1.

Nearly all prior research having to do
with inter-ethnic vs. intra-ethnic divorce
rates has involved obtaining the ratio of
divorces to marriages for within- vs.
across-groups matings for a given year
or set of years. All marriages include a
very large proportion of nonresident
marriages and, as shown in Table 2,
these nonresident marriages are very

riages. Divorces, by law, are of legal residents. These nonresidents who marry
include some of the over six million
tourists who visit Hawaii each year and
of the many thousands of military living
on-base and not counted as part of the
population. (Military personnel and dependents living off-base are counted as
residents by the State of Hawaii but are
not likely to be long-term residents with
any frequency.) The vast majority of
nonresident marriages will, if they result
in divorce, result in divorce somewhere
else than in Hawaii. In consequence,
when divorce rates are calculated by dividing the number of resident divorces
by the number ofall (nonresident as well
as long-term resident) marriages, two
major distortions will occur. First, since
the vast majority of nonresident marriages are Caucasian xX Caucasian, and
divorces of nonresidents probably occur

elsewhere, the divorce rate of Caucasian X Caucasian marriages will be
markedly underestimated. Second, for
the same reason, within-ethnic-group
divorces will be underestimated. It was
only in 1985 that the State Department
of Health listed resident marriages (one
or both parties resident) separately from
all marriages in the Annual report and
specified separately for residents and for
nonresidents who married whom, by
race of partner. The present report contrasts marriage/divorce data based on all
marriages with resident marriage/
divorce data for the years 1985, 1986,
and 1987.

Analyses of Hawaii marriage data
(Johnson, 1984; Labov and Jacobs,
1986) showed that the probability of
marrying cross-ethnically was strongly
related to group size; the smaller the
group, the higher the probability of outmarriage. If outmarriage occurs, there is
a strong tendency for those persons who
outmarry to marry individuals from
groups similar to their own in income
level (Johnson, 1984). We shall examine
the association of income with marriage/
divorce ratios for resident marriages/
resident divorces.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS AND MEASURES

The subjects are those persons from
Hawaii's five major ethnic groups listed
in the State of Hawaii Data Book (198688) as having married or divorced in
1985-87. Table 2 is a presentation of
data for all marriages, for resident marriages, and for divorces, along with a
presentation of percentages of divorces
to marriages for all marriages and for
resident marriages only.

The rank order of mean group in
Social Biology

come of residents of Hawaii has stayed
constant for over a decade. The most recent data (U.S. Bureau of Census, 1983,
census definitions of race are not fully
comparable to the definitions used by
the State of Hawaii Department of
Health) show the mean family income
of the five groups assessed herein to be,
from high to low: Chinese, $32,388; Japanese, $31,994; Caucasian, $26,557; Filipino, $22,921; and Hawaiian/part Hawaiian, $22,166. (In eight of ten
comparisons [5 groups x 2 sexes], persons who married across racial ethnic
groups had lower mean incomes than
those who married within their own
group.) As mentioned earlier, prior research (Johnson, 1984) having to do
with all marriages (since resident marriage data were not then reported on
separately by race/ethnicity of partner)
showed that persons who married across
groups showed a strong tendency to
marry persons from income groups similar to their own. We will present comparable data for resident marriages in the
years 1985-87. In addition, these income data will be used in contrasting the
divorce rates of resident marriages in
which the bride is from an ethnic group
higher in income than that of the groom
with rates when the difference in group
income favors the ethnic group of the
groom.

RESULTS

Like many prior studies cited above
in which all marriages and resident divorces provide the data for analysis, the
data shown in Table 2 show the proportion of inter-ethnic marriages to divorces to be higher than the divorce ratios of intra-ethnic marriages

from McNemar’s [1949, p. 76] formula
for establishing the significance of differences between proportions). This difference in favor of within-group marriages succeeding more often is almost
solely a consequence of the fact that
over half of all (resident plus nonresident) marriages are Caucasian xX Caucasian marriages and, when assessing all
marriages, Caucasian cross-ethnic marriages (especially those of Caucasian
women) are more likely to result in divorce. When the proportion of divorces
to marriages is calculated from only the
resident marriage data, the differences
are significantly (z = 25.85; p < 0.001)
in the opposite direction; there is a
lesser proportion of divorces to marriages in inter-ethnic than in intra-ethnic
marriages for the combined five groups.
Looking at each group separately, we
see that 29 of 40 possible outmarriages
combinations (5 groups X 4 possible
outmarriages x brides and grooms separately) are less at risk than withingroup marriages. Summing all crossethnic matings for given sex X ethnic

husbands (z = 59.48, p < 0.001), Caucasian wives (z = 17.57, p < 0.001), and
Filipino wives (z = 7.77, p< 0.001)
have significantly lower across-group
than within-group divorce-to-marriage
ratios. The reverse is shown for Hawatian husbands (z = 4.27, p< 0.001),
with the across-group divorce-tomarriage ratio being higher.

The proportions of obtained to expected resident marriages, 1985-87, for
each possible cross-group mating combination is shown in Table 3. The expected number is based on the per cent
of persons in the total long-term resident population (ignoring, in this analysis, military and military dependents) of

tiplied by the per cent that each of the
four outgroups are of the outgroup population. The procedures used in calculating these values are fully described in
Johnson (1984). The mean per cents of
brides and grooms marrying across differing amounts of disparity in groupincome level are shown in Table 4. (For
example, Chinese marrying Hawaiian/
Part Hawaiian spouses would differ by
four income levels; Caucasians marrying either Chinese or Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian spouses would differ by two
group-income levels.)

Like the earlier data, the present data
show that persons who marry across
racial/ethnic groups tend to marry persons from groups similar to their own in
terms of income. This tendency is somewhat stronger for the present set of longterm resident marriages than it was for
the data presented in Johnson (1984),
based on all 1975-77 marriages.

The percentage ratio of resident marriages to divorces did not show any consistent variation across differing levels of
income disparity, as was shown above
for marriage data. However, crossethnic marriages involving ethnic combinations in which the ethnic group income of the bride is higher than that of
the groom vary significantly in divorce
rate from the reverse combinations for
resident marriages (38.96 per cent vs.
35.33 per cent; z = 3.64; p< 0.001).

DISCUSSION

One major problem in the use of
these published demographic data
needs to be raised prior to discussing the
obtained results. Persons marrying in
any time interval are not the same as
those divorcing over the same time interval. If the proportions of inter-ethnic
marriages change over time, comparing

present divorce data (consisting, in large
part, of couples married years previously) with present marriages could lead
to either an overestimate or underestimate of within- or across-group
marriage-to-divorce rates. Data from
Labov and Jacobs (1986, p. 83) and
from the State Department of Health

Annual Report (1988) show only a small
increase, 1979-87, in outmarriage rates
for most of the 10 groups (5 ethnic
groups X 2 sexes) reported on herein,
which indicates that this problem is not
great. However, there has been a substantial increase in the proportions of
Japanese (especially males) who out

marry. In consequence, a comparison of
the 1985~87 marriage to divorce ratio
for persons of Japanese ancestry almost
certainly results in at least something of
an underestimate of Japanese interethnic divorce rates and an overestimate
of Japanese intra-ethnic divorce rates.

There seems to be no really good way
around the problem described above.
One can study a marriage cohort across
time, as was done by Schwertfeger
(1982), but then one loses data from
those who leave Hawaii and divorce
elsewhere, and there probably are substantial ethnic differences in rates of migration from Hawaii. While differential
rates of inmigration/outmigration and
secular trends in intermarriage rates
would have influenced the results we reported above it seems clear that the major source of difference in marriage risk
of within vs. across ethnic group marriages is that which results from a comparison of all marriages with divorce
data vs. resident marriages with divorce
data.

Resident marriages were not reported separately in the State Department of Health Annual Report by race/
ethnicity of the spouses, from all marriages, including those of nonresidents,
until 1985. Those studies cited in the introduction that reported on divorce
data, using essentially the same procedure used herein, necessarily reported
on the ratio of divorces to marriages using data having to do with all marriages
including those of nonresidents. The
present data set for all marriages is confirmatory of these earlier reports in
showing a higher overall ratio of divorces to marriages for inter-ethnic marriages. As noted above, the higher risk
for cross-ethnic marriages, for combined resident and nonresident marriages is almost solely the result of dif
Social Biology

ferences found in the Caucasian sample.
These differences are sharply reversed
when the ratio of divorces to resident
marriages forms the basis of analysis.
The lesser proportion of inter-ethnic
than intra-ethnic divorces to long-term
resident marriages is largely a result of
the striking difference in proportions
among Caucasians. These very large differences are in part a consequence of the
fact that visitors and transient residents
usually are of Caucasian ancestry, and
some of these people are getting divorces also. However, 1f Caucasians are
excluded, 18 of 24 (2 sexes x 4
groups X 3 comparisons) of other crossethnic combinations show lower acrossthan within-group divorce-to-marriage
ratios. Prior reports (nearly always
based on marriage data that combined
resident and nonresident marriages) to
the contrary, cross-ethnic marriages of
permanent residents in Hawaii are less
rather than more at risk for divorce, perhaps because they require a greater initial commitment.

It has been shown (Johnson, 1984)
that persons who marry members of
groups other than their own tend to
marry persons from groups similar to
their own in income. The present data
show this same tendency even more
strongly for resident marriage data.
Prior reports nearly always emphasize
that some cross-ethnic marriage combinations are far less likely to end in divorce than are other combinations. Specific ‘‘good”’ or ‘‘bad’”’ combinations
vary across reports and, for the most
part, explanations for variations in marital success are lacking.

The present report shows that the income levels of ethnic groups are associated with marriage/divorce ratios, risk
being significantly greater for marriages
in which the income of the bride’s ethnic

group is higher than that of the groom,
as compared with the reverse. As noted
in the marriage paper cited above, income probably is not a predictor in its
own right so much as it is an indicator of
group differences in education, achievement motivation, ability to delay gratification, and other characteristics that
might be expected to influence income.
In any event, “good” marriage combinations, in terms of low divorce rates,
generally are ethnic combinations in
which brides marry hypergamously

(marrying ‘“‘up’”’). Obviously, other variables aside from hypergamy-hypogamy
also are involved in influencing the relative divorce risk of differing racial/ethnic
combinations, and these variables are,
as yet, unassessed. Individual educational and occupational data (as opposed to group-income data used
herein) having to do with hypergamy vs.
hypogamy as they relate to both withinand across-group marriages and divorces might be a fruitful area for further research.
