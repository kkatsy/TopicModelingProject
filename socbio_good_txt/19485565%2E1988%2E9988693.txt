Fifty Years of Canadian Jewish Mortality

ABSTRACT: No reliable life tables for Jews appear ever to have been published before in either
the United States or Canada. This study presents abridged life tables for Jews of the City of
Montreal at approximately ten-year intervals over the period 1920 to 1971. For much of the half
century, about one-third of the Canadian Jewish population lived in the City of Montreal. For
the first thirty years of the period, the ‘“Jewish pattern of mortality” —very low mortality up to
early middle age, with relatively high mortality rates thereafter—was evident. But by the end of
the 1960’s, the traditional mortality pattern had disappeared. At that time, female Montreal
Jews had an expectation of life at birth similar to that for Canadian women of all religions, but
the comparable expectation for male Montreal Jews was higher than that for the males of any

country in the world.

Several attempts have been made to
construct life tables for North American
Jews, but virtually all the resulting tables have been of dubious accuracy. In
the United States, no questions on the
religion of respondents have ever been
included in the population census, so
that even the numbers and age distribution of Jews in the country are not
known precisely. In Canada, by contrast, the age distribution is known accurately and in detail, as information on
the Jewish population, defined both by
religion and by ethnicity, that is, by Jewish descent, has been collected in censuses since 1901. But statistical information on the age-specific mortality of Jews
remains rare, and all of it that has been
made available relates to Jews by ethnic
origin. For simplicity, in the remainder
of this paper, where it is necessary to distinguish between the two categorizations of Jews, those classified in terms of
their religious denomination will be referred to as “Jews (R),”’ whereas those
defined in terms of their ethnic origin
will be referred to as “‘Jews (E).”

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Unpublished information on the
mortality of Jews (E) appears to have
been collected by most of the provinces
between 1921 and about 1962, but little
more than the total number of deaths
for each sex was published. Nevertheless, Spiegelman (1948) and Fauman
and Mayer (1969) were able to obtain
access to some of the unpublished material, and to produce life tables for Canadian Jews (E) using the officially collected statistics.

Spiegelman’s life tables were based
on the age distribution at death of 505
Jews (E) who died in Ontario in 1943.
Because of the small numbers involved,
his estimates of the mortality rates, particularly at the younger ages, where very
few deaths could have occurred, would
have been subject to large sampling errors.

The life table estimates for Canadian
Jews (E) published by Fauman and
Mayer were calculated by W. Zayachkowski of the Dominion Bureau of Sta

tistics, and were based on a much larger
sample of deaths, consisting of three
years (1960-62) of Jewish (E) mortality
data for all the Canadian Provinces
other than Ontario, British Columbia,
and Newfoundland (Fauman and
Mayer, 1969, p. 426). The numbers of
deaths were compared with the age distribution of ethnic Jews in the population census for 1961 to produce the agespecific mortality rates from which the
life tables were constructed. Unfortunately, however, these mortality rates
were almost certainly overestimated,
but to a different degree at different
ages.

In the 1961 census, the number of
Jews classified by ethnic origin was
anomalous, even “inaccurate,” in the
sense that the number so defined was
very different from—about one-third
less than—the number of Jews defined
by religious denomination. In the five
censuses before 1951, the difference had
always been small, approximately 1 per
cent or so. The main explanation of the
sudden large discrepancies in 1951 and
1961 appears to have been a change in
census editing procedure.

Some editing had always been required because Jews have never fitted
readily into the ethnic classification used
in the census. Each census listed examples of the major ethnic groups, including Jews, but in no census was the concept of ethnicity explicitly defined. The
instructions given to the enumerators in
the 1951 census and in later ones suggested that, for persons in most cultural
groups, ethnicity was determined
largely by the language the person spoke
or his nationality on arrival in Canada,
or, if he were born in North America,
the language or nationality of his paternal ancestor when he first came to this
continent. But Jews have no common

language or nationality. So, for example, a Jew born in Poland, who was
brought to live with relatives in France
as a baby, and who migrated to Canada
as an adult, could equally reasonably
claim his ethnicity to be Polish (his nationality), or French (his language), or
Jewish.

The problem was dealt with in other
censuses—certainly in those of 1931,
1941, and 1971, and probably in those of
1911 and 1921—by the census editors
classifying all respondents who declared
their religion to be Jewish as being ethnically Jewish as well (Norland [Yam],
1974, p. 36). However, in the censuses of 1951 and 1961, this procedure was not
followed, with the result that over eighty
thousand persons who recorded their religion as Jewish in 1961 were classified in
the census as being other than Jewish by
origin. Moreover, the ratio of the numbers of Jews (R) to the numbers of Jews
(E) varied substantially between different age groups. But we may assume that
virtually all the Jews by religion who declared their ethnic origin to be nonJewish in the census, and who died in
the 1950’s and 1960’s, would have been
reported at death as being Jewish by
“racial origin,” the ethnic category on
the registration-of-death form, by the
undertaker responsible for completing
the form. Typically, no more than two
undertakers would arrange the burials
of all Jews (R) dying within a city, even
large cities such as Montreal and Toronto, and it would be more or Jess automatic for these undertakers to record
persons buried according to Jewish religious rites as ethnic Jews.

If this were not the case, we would
expect to find a sharp break in the trend
of Jewish mortality rates calculated by
comparing Jewish (E) deaths with Jewish (R) population in the 1950’s and

1960’s. But no such break was observed
(see Tables 2, 3, and 4, below). Jewish
mortality rates did not plummet in the
1950’s and early 1960’s, and then soar in
1971. They continued to decline fairly
steadily throughout the period. Hence,
we may conclude that the Fauman and
Mayer (1969) estimates of the Canadian
Jewish population at risk in the early
1960’s were much too low, and that as a
consequence the calculated mortality
rates were much too high.

In this paper, which presents for the
first time reasonably accurate life tables
for Canadian Jews extending over half a
century, the group principally examined
are Jews from the City of Montreal. The
populations at risk, in both Montreal
and Canada as a whole, are based on the
census figures of Jews (R), but the
deaths nominally relate to Jews (E).
However, for the reasons discussed
above, the recorded number of deaths
of Jews (E) can be assumed to be the
same as the number of deaths of Jews
(R), so that, in effect, all the mortality
rates given in this paper can be taken to
relate to Jews (R).

The numbers of deaths of Montreal
Jews were obtained from the Annual
Reports of the Department of Health of
the City of Montreal, 1920-1971. All
tests of the reliability of the statistics, including comparisons with census information, indicated that the mortality
figures were reasonably accurate. In
some years, the numbers of Jewish
deaths in each age group were not given
for each sex separately, but only for
both sexes combined. In these cases, the
procedure used to divide the deaths between the sexes for any given age group
was to assume that the ratio of the male
Jewish mortality rate to the Jewish mortality rate for both sexes combined for
that age group was equal to the comparable ratio for the Canadian population

of all religions in the nearest census
year. Throughout the calculations,
where the age intervals in the source
used did not correspond with those in
the abridged life tables, the numbers in
the required age intervals were estimated by cumulating the original data
and using mid-panel cubic interpolation.

The population estimates for Montreal Jews (R) aged five years and above
were obtained from the decennial population censuses. But young children tend
to be underenumerated in censuses
(Spiegelman, 1968, pp. 59-60), and
they certainly were in the Canadian censuses of 1931 through 1971. In order to
avoid this problem, the population of
Montreal Jews under five years of age
was estimated from the number of births
in the previous five years.

Age-specific mortality rates relating
to the census years, 1931, 1941, 1951,
and 1961 were constructed by comparing the average number of deaths in
each age group over the five-year period
centered upon the census date with the
population at risk at that date. A different procedure had to be adopted for
1921 and 1971, as in neither of those
years was the age distribution of Jews in
the City of Montreal published in the
census. However, as the net migration
of Jews into or out of the city appears to
have been negligible between 1921 and
1931, the age distribution of the 1921
Jewish population could be estimated by
taking account of births during the decade, and by applying reverse survival
factors to the 1931 age distribution. The
method proved to be remarkably accurate. The first back projection, before
any subsequent adjustment, gave an estimated total Jewish male population
within 0.2 per cent of the total recorded
in the census.

A similar procedure could not be
Vol. 35, No. 1-2

used to derive the age distribution of the
Montreal Jewish population in 1971,
since there had been a massive net emigration, equivalent to almost a quarter
of the 1961 population, from the city between 1961 and 1971. The numbers in
each age group in 1971 were estimated
by assuming that the age distribution of
the Jewish net emigration from the city
was the same as that of migrants of
wn “other” religions (that is, neither CathoS lic nor one of the principal Protestant
5 denominations) moving within the same
'E province during the period 1966-71

A latest year on which a five-year span of
deaths could be centered was 1969. In
the absence of more detailed information, it was assumed that the Jewish population of the city declined at a constant
proportional rate between 1961 and
1971. This implied that the total Jewish
population of the city in 1969 was 6.14
per cent greater than the population in
1971, and for simplicity, it was assumed
that the numbers in all age groups
changed in proportion.
The method used to obtain the /, values in the abridged life tables for City of

Montreal Jews aged between 5 and 69
years was similar to that described by
Keyfitz (1977, pp. 39-41), although the
method was generalized so as to apply to
age intervals of irregular widths. Information on the number of deaths of Montreal Jews in the older age groups was
available, but not data on the age breakdown of the older population at risk.
However, the /, values for the higher
ages could be derived by assuming that
age-specific mortality rates, ,M,, increased exponentially after the age of
70. The procedure followed was similar
to that given in Keyfitz (1968, pp. 12651266), save that the parameters of an exponential relationship had to be estimated rather than those of the linear
relationship assumed by Keyfitz.

For ages below five, /, values were
obtained by using an iterative procedure
based on that described by Keyfitz
(1968, pp. 1263-1265), where the population numbers are not taken from the
census, but are estimated from the number of births in the previous five years.
An implicit assumption in using this
method is that no net migration occurs
in the five years before the census, but a
comparison of the Montreal Jewish population at successive censuses taking account of intercensal births and deaths,
showed that there was appreciable net
immigration between 1941 and 1951,
and even greater net emigration between 1951 and 1971. Unfortunately,
we cannot infer the extent of net migration among children under five by summing births in the previous five years,
adjusting for mortality, and then comparing the result with the population
numbers in the census, since, as noted
above, the population under five years
old is almost invariably underenumerated in the census. But assuming that the
numbers of children aged 5—9 years are
accurately reported in the census, and

that the proportional rate of net migration is the same for children under five as
for children aged 5—9 years, then the
population of children under five may
be estimated corrected for both net migration and census underenumeration.
The procedure described above requires that the numbers of births used in
the calculations should be accurate, and
the numbers of male Jewish births registered in the City of Montreal appeared
to be so. But in most years the numbers
of female Jewish births recorded, both
in the City of Montreal and in Canada as
a whole, were suspiciously low. Thus,

during the period 1923-51, in which |

Jewish (E) birth statistics for Canada
were published in Vital Statistics, the average ratio of male to female live births
was 1.146. For the City of Montreal over
the period 1920-71, the average was
1.109. But the acceptable range of sexratios for live births is normally taken to
be 1.04-1.07 (Visaria, 1967), with ratios
consistently above 1.07 being strongly
suggestive of biased reporting.

The explanation of the underreporting of female Jewish births in the
Province of Quebec was well understood. In that province, where ministers
of religion were responsible for reporting births (Bailey, 1947, p. 257), the local rabbi would quickly learn of the
births of all male Jewish babies, who had
to be circumcised a few days after birth.

But there was no similar requirement

for Jewish baby girls, and asa result, the
births of female Jewish babies were less
reliably reported (Kuczynski, 1930, p.
56; City of Montreal, Department of
Health, 1934, pp. 278-284).

It is not clear why the births of Jewish
baby girls in other provinces should so
frequently have been under-reported,
but there can be little doubt that underreporting was common. One implica
Social Biology

tion of this finding is that estimates of
Jewish fertility based directly on data
from Vital Statistics will be biased downward. In an attempt to avoid similar
bias, in this study, female Jewish births
were assumed to be equal to 94.34 per
cent (= 1/1.06) of male Jewish births in
the same year.

Having obtained the /, column of the
life tables, we derived the ,,d,, ,p,, and
ngx Values from the /, column in the
usual manner. But the ,,L, values, being
obtained by integrating the theoretical
I(x) curve associated with the observed
l. values, can be calculated in a number
of ways. For ages under five, the ,,L, values were in fact obtained by integrating
the hyperbola that was fitted iteratively
to the Jp, /; and /; values. For ages between 5 and 64 years, where the ageintervals on both sides of the interval for
which ,,, was calculated were of five
years, the /(x) curve was assumed to be
approximated by a series of cubic arcs,
the equation used to obtain the ,,L, values being that given by Greville (1943,
Equation (14), p. 40). For ages between
65 and 89 years, where the age intervals
were not of uniform width, the seconddegree equation used to obtain , L, was
that given by Greville (1943, at the top
of p. 42). For the open-ended age interval, 90 years and over, Loo was taken to
be equal to log / Moo.

Having obtained the, L, columns, we
derived the remaining columns in the
life table, ,, 7, and é,, in the usual way.

changed little over the fifty years. The
lower fertility of the Jews, which led toa
progressively aging population, was almost offset by net immigration. For
most of the period, about one-third of
the Jews in Canada lived in the City of
Montreal. But in the 1950’s and 1960’s,
the proportion declined steeply as many
of the Jewish residents of the city moved
to the suburbs, though still within the
Metropolitan area of Montreal, and to
other parts of Canada.

JEWISH SURVIVAL PROBABILITIES

Table 2 presents, for six intervals between 1920 and 1971, the numbers of
male and female Montreal Jews from
hypothetical cohorts of 100,000 live
births who could be expected to survive
to various ages. The twelve columns
given are in fact the /, columns of twelve
abridged life tables, and the remaining
columns of each life table can readily be
derived from the /, values in Table 2.

A comparison of successive columns
in Table 2 shows that over the fifty-year
period examined, the survival rates for
Montreal Jews improved remarkably.

Whereas on the basis of the 1920-22 life
table, 10 per cent of live-born males had
died before reaching the age of 10 years,
in 1967-71 it was not until age 55 that 10
per cent had died. On the 1920-22 survival probabilities, less than 40 per cent
of both males and females could be expected to survive to the age of 70 years;
by 1967~71, the proportion had risen to

_nearly three-quarters.

Throughout the period, for both
males and females, a higher proportion
of Jews survived into their 50’s than did
Canadians of all religions, but before
1959-63 non-Jewish Canadians who
reached retiring age had somewhat better prospects of further survival than did
Montreal Jews of the same age. By
1959-63, however, the survival levels of
Jewish females and Canadian females of
all religions were fairly similar at most
ages, and the two groups stayed broadly
in line throughout the 1960’s. Montreal
Jewish males, on the other hand, by the
end of the 1950’s had far outstripped
their gentile compatriots and had
achieved survival levels at most ages
that were not attained by male Canadians Of all religions until 1980-82.

AGE PATTERN OF MORTALITY

A number of authors comparing Jewish mortality with that of non-Jews in the
same country in the first half of this century have commented on the remarkably consistent pattern found (Ruppin,
1934, pp. 85-90; Spiegelman, 1948;
Seidman et al., 1962; Goldstein, 1966;
Fauman and Mayer, 1969). The profile

 

of age-specific mortality observed was
so consistent that we may call it, the
“Jewish pattern of mortality.”’ Typically, infant and childhood mortality
rates for Jews would be very much lower
than the national mortality rates, often
less than half, for the same age groups.
The relatively favorable rates of Jewish
mortality would continue into early middle age, but then, in the 40’s or 50’s, the

Jewish rate would increase rapidly,
overtake that of the non-Jews, and remain above the gentile mortality rates at
all higher ages.

Some evidence of this pattern among
Jews in the City of Montreal is shown in
Table 3.

The characteristic pattern persisted
for both male and female Jews, though
becoming Jess pronounced over time,
until about the early 1950’s, as can be
seen in the bottom third of the table.
Jewish mortality rates up to that time
were much lower than those of Canadians in general for all age groups below
40, and higher for all age groups above
40. So few were the deaths among Jews
under 40 that, even though death rates
were based on five-years experience, the
mortality rates were subject to appreciable sampling variability.

Mortality rates tended to fall more
rapidly throughout the fifty-year period
for Jews than for non-Jews, particularly
among males, so that by the early
1960’s, male Jews had better survival
chances than male non-Jews in all age
groups. Among females, the traditional
pattern persisted longer. Whereas
among Jews, female mortality rates for
all age groups fell more rapidly than
those of males, among non-Jews the gap
between the mortality rates for the two
sexes widened even more dramatically.
As a consequence, the traditional Jewish mortality pattern was still faintly evident among females even as late as the
beginning of the 1960’s. But by the end
of the 1960s, for both male and female
Canadian Jews, the pattern had disappeared. It appears, however, that something of the pattern still lingered in at
least one Jewish community in the
United States into the 1980’s (Goldstein, 1986, pp. 89-90).

Nobody has ever been able to estab
 

Social Biology

lish a satisfactory explanation of the traditional pattern, largely because in
those countries where the pattern was
found little information on the causes of
death of Jews was available (though, see
Ruppin, 1934, pp. 88-94). The Annual
Reports of the Department of Health of
the City of Montreal do contain some
material on this topic, but unfortunately, neither the cause-of-death categories nor the age groups distinguished
are sufficiently fine to enable us to test
any of the more promising explanatory
hypotheses. In particular, no information on causes of death of the different
ethnic groups was published for the critical adult age groups—the open-ended
age group in the annual reports related
to persons over five years old.

Whatever the cause of the traditional
mortality pattern, it is clear that the explanation could not have been occupational, since Jewish men had much the
same pattern of mortality by age as Jewish women, but a very different occupational distribution. Nor is it likely, as
suggested by Spiegelman, (1948, p. |
301), that the very much lower mortality
rates at younger ages for Jews in itself
brought about higher mortality later in
life by merely postponing the deaths of
impaired persons from youth to middle
age. If that had been a major part of the
explanation, we would expect that the
later cohorts, with the lowest mortality
in the youthful age groups, would have
had the highest rates in middle age; that
is, that the traditional pattern would
have become more pronounced over
time. But, in fact, as we have seen, the
reverse occurred.

A plausible, though regrettably
vague, hypothesis would seek to explain
the phenomenon in terms of changes in
the Jewish way of life. The suggestion is
that the traditional Jewish way of life as
 

Vol. 35, No. 1-2

practiced in Europe and North America
in the first half of the century led to high
mortality in late middle age, possibly
from one or more of the degenerative
diseases. Then, after the Second World
War, as the Jews in the Western world,
including those in the City of Montreal,
came to behave more like their neighbors, particularly in their dietary habits,
so the pattern of their mortality rates be

striking. The great improvement that
occurred between the early 1920’s and
the late 1960’s in middle-age mortality
for Montreal Jewish males is shown by
the increase in expectation of life at age
40 of almost seven years between those
years. In contrast, over the same period
the expectation of life for the average
Canadian male at the same age increased by less than a year. But it was
the Montreal Jewish males who were
unusual; the experience of the middleaged Canadian males was comparable
with that of men of similar age in many
other industrialized countries throughout the period, particularly in the years
since about 1950 (see, United Nations,
1982, pp. 17-18).

tion of life at age 40, experienced a
greater improvement than women of
the same age in most other industrialized countries, but even so, they were
surpassed by Montreal Jewish women,
who, over the same period, increased
their expectation of life at 40 by nineand-a-half years.

Throughout the half century covered
by Table 4, the male/female difference
in expectation of life at birth was much
smaller—less than half in the late
1960’s—for Montreal Jews than for Canadians of all religions. Again, the relatively small differential between the
sexes appears to be a fairly common
Jewish pattern, found both among
American and Israeli Jews in the 1950’s
and 1960’s, (Fauman and Mayer, 1969,
Table 3, p. 420; United Nations, 1979,
Table 8, p. 553).

Though female Jews of Montreal had
an expectation of life at birth at the end
of the 1960’s that was approximately the
same as that for Canadian females of all
religions, male Jews of Montreal at the
same period had an expectation of life at
birth which, at 73.3 years, was not only
substantially greater than the 69.3 years
expectation of all Canadian males in
1970-72, but was greater than that enjoyed by the males of any other country
in the early or mid 1970’s, (United Nations, 1982, Table II.1, p. 7).

EXTENT TO WHICH THE MorRTALITY
RATES OF MONTREAL JEWS WERE
REPRESENTATIVE OF THOSE OF THE
TOTAL JEWISH POPULATION OF CANADA

Groups of people of similar ethnic origin who live in different areas, even
within the same city, may have very different mortality rates (see, for example,
Wilkins, 1980). The question arises,
then, as to whether the relatively low

 

Social Biology

mortality rates of the Jews of Montreal
reported in this study were peculiar to
them or were characteristic of the mortality experience of the whole Canadian
Jewish community. The question is not
easy to answer, since if we had reliable
information on the age-specific mortality of all Canadian Jews, we would use it
and would not work with data relating to
only a fraction, albeit a large fraction, of
the Canadian Jewish population.

Some information on the mortality of
all Canadian Jews, however, is available. For the period 1923 through 1951
the Federal Government’s annual publication, Vital Statistics, gave the total
numbers of deaths of Canadian Jews
(E), classified by sex, though not by age.
But these totals do enable us to check to
some extent the degree to which the
mortality rates of Montreal Jews
reflected the experience of Canadian
Jews in general.

If ,P, is the population of Canadian
Jews of a particular sex, agedx tox +n
at a given date, and ,M,” is the agespecific mortality rate for Montreal Jews
of the same sex, over a period centered
at the given date, then=,,P,°. ,M,’"is the
total number of deaths of Canadian
Jews that could be expected to occur in
each year of the period, if all Canadian
Jews were subject to the same mortality
rates as the Jews of Montreal.

Table 5 compares the expected number of deaths so calculated with the actual number, 2 ,P,¢. ,M,¢, for the three
periods, 1929-33, 1939-43, and 194951, for which such comparisons can
readily be made.

Table 5 shows that for each sex, and
for each period examined, the expected
number of deaths, assuming that the
Montreal Jewish mortality rates applied |
to the whole of the Jewish population of
Canada, was somewhat greater than the
