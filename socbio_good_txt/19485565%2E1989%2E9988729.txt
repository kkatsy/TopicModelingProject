Fecundability and Husband’s Age

ABSTRACT: The effect of husband’s age on the probability of conception is evaluated from
World Fertility Survey data in five developing countries: the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Kenya, the
Sudan, and Syria. Proportional hazards models, which include wife’s age, husband’s age,
marriage duration, union type, and post-partum exposure as covariates, are used to describe
the monthly conception rate for second and higher-order birth intervals in which no
contraception was used. With the exception of Syria, the resulting models indicate that the
effects of male age are generally small in relation to the influences of marital duration and the

age of the woman.

This paper considers a fundamental
demographic issue about which surprisingly little is known: the effects of husband’s age on fecundability. The female
reproductive span is well demarcated by
the events of menarche and menopause,
and reproductive physiology sets natural bounds on the female age pattern of
fertility. The standard indices of fertility
are therefore rarely defined except in
terms of female ages. More sophisticated approaches to fertility measurement, such as statistical models of birth
intervals, may include a woman’s age
among the covariates but seldom give
the age of her partner commensurate attention. To what extent is this relative
neglect of partner’s or husband’s age
justified? That is, to what extent can varlation in a couple’s fecundability, over a
joint reproductive career, be understood without reference to the age of the
husband?

The fecundability of noncontracepting couples may depend on the age of
the male for both behavioral and physiological reasons. Declines in coital fre
quency with husband’s age would certainly affect the probabilities of
conception. There might also be variations with age in the quality of sperm, as
reflected in its fertilizing power or in the
viability of conceptions. These influences on fecundability can be masked
by variation in contraceptive use with
husband’s age. One must somehow separate contraceptive users from nonusers
to isolate the fecundability effects, and
yet doing so raises questions about selectivity that are difficult to resolve. To
minimize the problems of selectivity
that are inherent in such an exercise, we
shall focus our investigation on populations with low levels of contraceptive
prevalence.

Two additional considerations guide
the selection of countries for the study.
In many societies the statistical associations between the ages of husband and
wife are too close to permit separate influences on fecundability to be easily
discerned. With other things held equal,
male age effects are estimated more precisely in samples containing significant

variation in spouse ages, with substantial numbers of wives and husbands
widely separated in age. Many of the societies characterized by wide age gaps
between spouses are polygynous. As
several investigations have shown,
women in polygynous unions exhibit
lower lifetime and period fertility
(Garenne and van de Walle, 1985; Bean
and Mineau, 1986; Pebley and Mbugua,
1989). Junior wives in such households
tend to be married to men who are considerably older, and it has been suggested that the gap in age, rather than
polygyny per se may be the source of the
fertility differential. To assess this possibility, we will examine societies which
are polygynous in varying degrees.

We consider five developing countries in which the age gaps between
spouses are wide enough to yield substantial variations in age of husbands by
age of wife: the Ivory Coast, Ghana,
Kenya, the Sudan, and Syria. In three of
these—Ivory Coast, Ghana, and
Kenya—the conception risks facing
women in polygynous households can
be compared to the risks for those residing in monogamous households. In only
one (Syria) of the sample countries does
contraceptive prevalence exceed 10 per
cent.! Total fertility rates for these countries in the late 1970's range from about
6 in Syria and in Ghana to about 8 in
Kenya (Goldman et al., 1985).

We measure conception risks in
terms of the hazard functions characterizing birth-to-conception intervals.
Data from the World Fertility Surveys
are employed to estimate multivariate
models of interval length. Subject to restrictions to be discussed below, these

Fecundability and Husband’s Age 147

WFS data permit an assessment of the
effects of husband’s age on fecundability, net of the influence of other proximate determinants.

REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE:
AGE AND FECUNDABILITY

It is convenient to express fecundability as the product of four probabilities: the probability that a woman’s
menstrual cycle is ovulatory; the likelihood of intercourse within the fertile period; the conditional probability of fertilization given a coital act; and the
probability that the fertilized egg survives. While the likelihood of ovulation
is independent of the age of the male,
each of the remaining three factors
could be affected by male age or the age
of the female.

The likelihood of intercourse within
the fertile period is well approximated
by coital frequency.” There is persuasive
evidence of a decline in coital frequency
with male and female ages and with
marriage duration (Westoff, 1974; Udry
and Morris, 1978; Udry et al., 1982), although the evidence presented is generally univariate in nature. Rather less is
known about the separate contributions
of male aging, female aging, and marriage duration when the other two factors are controlled.

Four studies based on U.S. data have
considered spouse ages and marriage
duration in a multivariate setting. Trussell and Westoff (1980) report that coital
frequency declines with wife’s age, husband’s age, and marriage duration when
all three variables are entered in a regression. The relative magnitudes of the
three effects are not discussed. Udry

*See Potter and Millman (1985, 1986) for an assessment of nonproportionality in effects at high
coital frequencies.

(1980) has found that marriage duration
dominates wife’s and husband’s age in a
regression analysis of coital frequency,
using panel data on young couples in the
U.S. Two studies drawing on panel data
from the 1970 and 1975 National Fertility Surveys (Jasso, 1985; Kahn and
Udry, 1986) confirm the negative effect
of marriage duration. Neither finds a
strong influence of husband’s age on coital frequency and there is disagreement
over whether the effect of wife’s age is
significant. Taken together, these
results support the often-held view that
marriage duration is the best single
proxy for the frequency of coitus.

In addition to the direct effects of coital frequency on conception risks, there
is an indirect relationship of potential
significance.? The longer the intervals
between coitus, the larger the proportion of aged sperm in the male reproductive tract in relation to youthful sperm.‘
Two aspects of the age of sperm appear
important in respect to fertilization.
Sperm motility—that is, the existence
and vigor of movement—may be a function of the age of the cell, as may the in
3Although we stress here the effect of coital frequency on the age distribution of sperm at issue,
there is a supporting argument concerned with the
aging of the sperm and egg in the female reproductive tract. In man, unlike many other species, there
is no natural synchronization in the arrival of
sperm and the availability of a receptive ovum.
Upon deposition in the female genital tract, sperm
lose their fertilizing capacity within some 48 hours;
an egg loses its capacity to be fertilized within 6 to
24 hours after ovulation (Potter and Millman,
1986). The lower is coital frequency, the greater
the likelihood that one gamete will have lost its fertilizing potential by the time it encounters the
other. Hence, lower coital frequencies exert a direct and indirect influence on conception risks.

{It is also the case that longer coital intervals
produce a greater volume of ejaculate and higher
counts of sperm per unit volume (MacLeod and
Gold, 1952). However, ejaculate volume bears no
important relation to risks of conception, and
MacLeod and Gold have found that only the very
low sperm densities appear to affect conception
risks.

Goldman and Montgomery

Social Biology

cidence of abnormalities in form (microcephalic heads, coiled tails, and the
like). MacLeod and Gold (1951a,
1953a) present data showing that the per
cent of active cells varies considerably
between the sperm samples of fertile
and infertile men. Moreover, in the fertile group, increases in motility show a
strong negative effect on waiting times
to conception. So far as MacLeod and
Gold could determine, abnormalities in
the form of sperm do not appear to influence waiting time to conception in the
sample of fertile men°; there is, however, a higher incidence of normal cells
in the samples of fertile men, in comparison to the levels in the infertile samples.

Holding coital frequency constant, is
there any evidence of a reduction in
sperm quality with male age? The early
research of MacLeod and Gold (19535)
uncovered little to suggest a “pure” age
effect, at least for men under 45.
Stronger results are presented in recent
work by Schwartz et al. (1983). Controlling for time since last intercourse, a
marked deterioration in sperm morphology (that is, an increase in abnormalities in form) is apparent among men
older than 40, and there is an indication
of a decline in motility in the sperm of
men over 45.

It 1s not clear whether the survival of
a fertilized egg is influenced by male
age.® Selvin and Garfinkel (1976) have

5MacLeod and Gold could not disentangle the
effects of sperm motility from sperm morphology
in a multivariate sense, due to collinearity between
these variables. Since their analyses of waiting
times ta conception employ only closed intervals,
they are subject to an unknown degree of bias.

6Frequency of intercourse, by affecting the aging of gametes in the female reproductive tract,
does appear to influence rates of spontaneous
abortion. See Guerrero and Rojas (1975) and the
discussion in Potter and Millman (1986) regarding
coital frequency and Down’s syndrome.

demonstrated a positive statistical association between husband’s age and fetal
loss with controls for the age of the wife.
However, their result might be interpreted either as a pure age effect or as a
reflection of variation in coital frequency and sperm quality.

The effects of female aging on fecundability are better understood, although
significant gaps in knowledge remain.
James (1979) has summarized the evidence. The likelihood of ovulatory menstrual cycles remains roughly constant,
at 97 per cent (other sources cite slightly
lower figures), from a woman’s early 20s
until age 40, on average. A decline occurs after age 40 as menopause is approached, and by age 45 only one-half of
cycles are ovulatory. Little evidence exists linking female age to probabilities of
fertilization (given coitus within the fertile period and an ovulatory cycle).
However, there is an age pattern in the
likelihood that a fertilized ovum will survive to the point at which the pregnancy
can be recognized. As James writes, “it
seems reasonable to suspect unrecognized spontaneous abortions of being
positively associated with maternal age”
(1979, p. 332). Finally, it appears well
established that spontaneous abortions
at later gestational ages are more likely
at higher maternal ages (Nortman,
1974; Selvin and Garfinkel, 1976).

Trussell and Wilson (1985), drawing,
on historical data and mathematical
models of reproduction, demonstrate
that levels of sterility among women exhibit only modest increases until age 40
(being no higher than 10-15 per cent by
age 35) but rise sharply thereafter. This
increase in sterility with age provides a
clue as to the age pattern of mean fecundability among women still able to conceive, but the precise relationship between the two is not known.

 

Fecundability and Husband’s Age 149

To sum up, the fecundability literature suggests that the bulk of the association between male age and conception
risks might be traced to frequencies of
intercourse. Lower frequencies directly
affect exposure to risks of conception,
and indirect effects associated with the
age distribution of issued sperm would
tend to reinforce the direct. The effects
of male aging on the fertilizing power of
sperm, while as yet poorly understood,
would appear to be small in relation to
the influence of coital frequency and the
aging of the female.

The demographic literature on male
age and fertility, though limited in
scope, comes to much the same conclusion. Anderson (1975) has considered
the relationship in turn-of-the-century
Irish census data. Although the census
tabulations do not permit detailed analysis, there is clear evidence of declines in
a couple’s final parity by age of husband,
controlling for wife’s age and marriage
duration. In a three-factor decomposition of nineteenth-century Mormon fertility, Mineau and Trussell (1983) find
wife’s age and marriage duration to have
the dominating effects. Husband’s age is
associated with the level of marital fertility, but its influence is small by comparison and limited for the most part to
marriage durations at which men are
age 45 or older.

The literature on fertility in polygynous conjugal unions emphasizes three
factors which may explain the lower fertility characteristic of women in such unions: coital frequency; primary sterility
or low fecundability among first wives;
and male age. The classic hypothesis remains that of Muhsam (1956), who
notes that with male sexual activity
roughly constant across union type, the
coital frequency of women in polygynous unions is reduced by comparison

150 Goldman and Montgomery

with its frequency in monogamous unions. Garenne and van de Walle (1985)
argue that, especially in Africa, the effect is reinforced when the husband
maintains a residence separate from
some of his wives (the “town wie and
village wife” case). In some instances
women may enter polygynous unions
which do not imply a sexual relationship
with the husband, as when a widow is
taken in by her former husband’s
brother. Wife rank, and its relation to
sterility or subfecundity, may also be important in explaining the fertility differential. Ifa first wife is sterile, a man may
recruit a second; in this case subfecundity precipitates a change in union type.
The relationship between wife rank and
fecundability can be even more complex. As Pebley and Mbugua (1989)
note, subfecund first wives may be divorced by their husbands, in which case
they may enter another household as a
junior wife. Both senior and junior
wives in polygynous unions may then be
more likely to be sterile than their counterparts in monogamous unions. In a
study of six African societies, Pebley
and Mbugua find the effects of junior
wife rank to be weak in samples of
women who have at least one birth.
Bean and Mineau (1986) show that,
among the Mormons, first wives exhibit
fertility levels that are higher than wives
of lower order.

Women in polygynous unions, and
particularly the junior wives, are often
married to men who are considerably
older. The lower fertility of second and
third wives found by Bean and Mineau
can be attributed in part to husband’s
age. Garenne and van de Walle (1985)
demonstrate that husband’s age accounts for much of the fertility differential in polygynous unions in Senegal. In
what follows we shall test for the exist

ence of a polygyny effect that is distinct
from the effect of husband’s age.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We draw on data from the individual
interviews of the World Fertility Surveys in the Ivory Coast, Ghana, Kenya,
the Sudan, and Syria. These surveys
cover women in the age range 15-49.
Women are included irrespective of
marital status in Ghana, the Ivory Coast
and Kenya; in Syria and the Sudan, only
ever-married women are surveyed. The
surveys are based on national samples,
except for that in the Sudan which was
restricted to the northern part of the
country (in which some 80 per cent of
the population resides).

Our interest is the risk of conception
within marriage or marital-like unions,
in intervals which begin with a birth and
end with a pregnancy resulting in a subsequent birth. Thus, we consider exposure to the risk of conception following a
woman’s first birth and count any subsequent conceptions only if they terminate
in a live birth.

The complete birth histories contained in the WFS core questionnaires
provide the basic information on the
month and year of each live birth. Although information on fetal loss and
stillbirths is available through the WFS
pregnancy histories, completeness of reporting varies considerably across samples (Ashurst and Casterline, 1984). In
our view, these data are not of sufficient
quality to be employed in the analyses
and we restrict ourselves to the conceptions which yield live births. Thus, in
what follows we shall study what has
been termed “effective fecundability.”

The exclusion of marriage-to-firstbirth intervals is advantageous in three
respects. First, it removes the necessity

em,

Vol. 36, No. 3-4

to locate the timing of conceptions in relation to the date of first marriage or the
date of first union formation. Given the
complexity of African marriage patterns, in particular, determination of a
single date of marriage is often difficult
(see Garenne and van de Walle, 1985;
Pebley and Mbugua, 1989). The dates
provided to interviewers may reflect
self-interpretation of survey questions
or recall bias. The exclusion of first birth
intervals has an additional advantage. It
renders all the birth intervals in the
study comparable to one another, in the
sense that each is characterized by a period of post-partum nonsusceptibility.
Finally, the restriction of the sample to
women of proven fertility gives a tighter
focus to the investigation of polygyny.
The estimates of polygyny effects provided by our samples will not be contaminated by primary sterility in the first
wife (or wives of any order).

While the WFS surveys contain complete marriage histories, questions on
the age of husbands refer only to the current or most recent husband. The question on husband’s age was asked of currently married women in Syria and the
Sudan, and of all ever-married women
in the other countries. A number of African countries include items related to
polygyny. The surveys in Ghana, the
Ivory Coast, and Kenya determined
whether the woman’s husband had
other wives. Interviewers in the Ivory
Coast and Kenya also ascertained the
rank of the respondent with respect to
her co-wives. Although polygyny exists
in Syria and the Sudan, no information
on union type is available through the
WES surveys.’

7As Chamie (1986) shows, while the incidence
of polygyny in Syria is low in comparison to West
African levels, as many as 8 per cent of men in
older rural cohorts are in polygynous unions.

 

Fecundability and Husband’s Age 151

Data on the proximate determinants
of fertility are required in our analyses
as controls for factors which may be confounded with husband’s age. In the case
of two important variables, data are collected only for the last closed interval
(the interval between the two most recent live births) and for the open interval (the interval from the most recent
live birth to the date of the survey).
Since the analyses are concerned with
conception risks in the absence of contraception, data on use are required to
eliminate contraceptive users from the
sample. Within-interval contraceptive
use data are available only for the last
closed and open intervals. Information
on breastfeeding, another important
proximate determinant, is similarly restricted. As discussed below, these limitations of survey design will make it necessary to confine estimates to a recent
reference period,

Additional information relating to
post-partum exposure is available from
the FOTCAF (Factors Other Than
Contraception Affecting Fertility) Module, designed to measure biological and
traditional restraints on fertility in countries with low levels of contraceptive
use. Each of the sample countries
adopted a variant of the module. The
modules contain a question, relating to
the two most recent births, on the age of
the child when supplemental foods were
introduced. Information was sought on
the durations of amenorrhea and abstinence following the last and the next-toJast pregnancies. The FOTCAF module
also inquired into the frequency and duration of separations between spouses
during the two most recent pregnancy
intervals and the current status of sexual
relations. Specific questions included in
the module vary across countries and
are described by Singh (1984).

SAMPLING FRAME

The design of the core WFS surveys
and FOTCAF modules imposes several
restrictions on the nature of the birth intervals which can be employed in our
analysis. The fact that data on contraceptive use and post-partum nonsusceptibility are collected for only the last
closed and the open interval requires us
to confine the analysis to a recent time
frame. Inclusion of all last closed and
open intervals would result in biased estimates of waiting times to conception:
Subfertile women, with atypically long
birth intervals, would be overrepresented in such a sampling scheme (see,
for examples and proof, Sheps and
Menken, 1973). An alternative strategy
is to draw all observations from a sampling window: a sampling period of
fixed, relatively short duration ending
with the date of interview. The period
should be short enough so that within it
very few women could have more than
one birth. (No data would be available
on behavior prior to the next-to-last
birth for women who contribute more
than one birth in the sampling window.)
For this analysis, we have chosen the
window to be three years in length, ending with the third month before the survey date.’ An additional advantage in
restricting the analysis to the recent past
is that it ensures greater accuracy in the
reported dates of birth and lengths of
post-partum variables.

As noted above, in two surveys the

8We have modified the reference period
slightly because we have a relatively poor count of
pregnancies at low gestations, i.e., women in the
early stages of pregnancy may not report their status correctly and many of these pregnancies may
not result in live births. We have excluded the most
recent three months from all calculations and use
the three-year period extending from four months
to 39 months prior to interview.

Goldman and Montgomery

Social Biology

data on partner’s age were obtained
only from currently married women.
We therefore consider only women who
are married at the time of interview and
select only those birth intervals in which
the woman was married (to her current
husband or partner) at the start of the interval.

In summary, our analysis is based on
last closed and open birth intervals
which contribute exposure to the threeyear period prior to survey date. Intervals with missing information on one or
more Of the relevant variables, intervals
in which contraception was used, and intervals which terminated in a nonlive
birth are excluded from the sampling
frame.’ The percentages of intervals excluded on these grounds are shown in
Table 1.

DaTA QUALITY

Detailed reviews of the quality of
data collected in the WFS surveys are
available elsewhere. Here we focus on

9Several additional criteria for inclusion of intervals into the analysis were imposed. Since reports of post-partum variables in the FOTCAF
module were obtained for the open and Iast closed
pregnancy rather than birth interval, we do not
have information for the next-to-last child for
women with a nonlive birth (i.e., spontaneous or
induced abortions, stillbirths) in the three-year reference period. We have chosen to eliminate all
women with nonlive births in the period from the
analysis. Finally, we eliminated intervals with
missing information on the relevant variables—
contraceptive use, length of breastfeeding, type of
union, and husband’s age.

104 comparative assessment of data quality indicates large variations across WFS surveys, with
considerably poorer reporting in surveys in Africa
and South Asia (Goldman et al., 1985). In spite of
strong evidence of deficiencies in the birth history
data (such as omission of births and displacement
of dates of birth) in many of the surveys, there are
clear indications that the completeness and accuracy of reporting of dates for the most recent births
are considerably higher than for earlier births
(Chidambaram and Sathar, 1984), a finding which

a variable of particular concern: partner’s age. One comparative analysis of
age differences between partners (Casterline et al., 1984; also see Casterline et
al., 1986) indicates that among WFS surveys in Africa, the percentage of interviews with the partner’s age not stated
ranges from zero to about 40 per cent. A
second study, which examines the relationship between polygyny and fertility
for a different set of WFS surveys in Africa, indicates a range between zero and
70 per cent (Pebley and Mbugua, 1989).
In our samples we find that in fewer than
one in a hundred intervals is husband’s
age unstated in Kenya, Ghana, Syria,

supports the decision to restrict estimates to a recent reference period.

Evaluations of the quality of data on the proximate determinants of fertility are more limited. A
number of investigators note the extensive heaping at multiples of six months in the reported durations of breastfeeding and amenorrhea (e.g., Ferry
and Smith, 1981). Nevertheless, the same studies
indicate that the overall bias, at Jeast for reported
durations of breastfeeding, generally appears to be
low. It is likely, however, that other proximate determinant variables, such as the duration of postpartum amenorrhea, abstinence or the timing of
supplementation, are less well reported than the
length of lactation. For example, Hobcraft and
Guz (1985) note that substantial proportions of
women in the African WFS surveys report durations of post-partum amenorrhea and abstinence
which extend beyond the next conception.

and Sudan, yet the proportion missing is
over two-thirds in the Ivory Coast (see
Table 1).

Could information on male ages be
virtually complete in four out of these
five countries? These are societies which
show substantial evidence of age misreporting in general and a lack of knowledge of age for females in particular.
Moreover, there are anomalies in the
ages recorded, for example, in Ghana
some 10 per cent of partners’ ages were
coded as 86+, whereas only 2 per cent
of partners had ages reported in the
range 70 to 85.1 Finally, data reported
in Casterline et al. (1984) show that the
extent of heaping (on digits 0 and 5) for
partner’s age is apparently unrelated to
the frequency of unstated ages.

In short, these age data would appear
to have’been imputed in an unknown,
but possibly substantial number of
cases. Unfortunately, no documentation exists as to the nature and extent of
imputation, which suggests that imputation must have occurred during the field
work or at an early stage of data processing.

Because of this anomaly, we eliminated from
the Ghana file the observations in which the partner’s age was given as 70 or older.

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

Table 2 presents descriptive statistics
on the sample of intervals included in
the analysis. The median number of
months from a birth to a subsequent
conception ranges from a low of 17
months in Syria to a high of 30 months in
Ghana. The data indicate large average
age differences between spouses (between seven and ten years) and relatively long durations of breastfeeding
(between 13 and 18 months). In both

Goldman and Montgomery

Social Biology

Ghana and the Ivory Coast, the average
duration of post-partum abstinence is
potentially long enough to have a notable impact on the length of the ensuing
pregnancy interval. The data on polygyny, which were collected for three of
the five surveys, indicate that roughly
one-third of the intervals occurred in polygynous unions.

Although very few WFS surveys included direct questions on coital frequency, a number of surveys contain information which could, in theory,

Intervals are excluded for the following reasons: use of contraception; not currently married; husband’s age, length of breastfeeding, or type of union unknown. All observations are excluded if a woman had a nonlive birth in the 3-year window. Also
excluded are cases in Ghana in which husband’s age was reported to be 70 or greater.

provide indirect assessments of the frequency of intercourse. Three such variables are included here: whether the husband and wife reside together, whether
the couple is “having sex these days,”
and the number of months (relative to
the length of the pregnancy interval)
that the husband and wife were separated. (Information on the first two variables was not collected in Sudan and
Syria.) The data on co-residence show
that in as many as 20 per cent of unions
in Ghana and in Kenya the wife lives ina
residence separate from her husband’s.
A substantial percentage of women
(ranging between 22 and 48 per cent)
report not having had sexual relations
“these days.” A measure of temporary
separation of wives and husbands—the
fraction of the birth interval in which the
husband was away—shows little variation in these samples. Most respondents
said that the husband had not been away
at all. However, the only absences recorded in the survey were those of duration three months or longer. Thus, the
measure may systematically understate
the extent of separation.”

METHODS

The methods employed to estimate
conception risks are the multivariate
versions of life table methods known as
hazard models. The hazard framework
has been extensively described elsewhere (e.g., Kalbfleisch and Prentice,
1980). Some modifications of the usual

The measure is flawed in other respects as
well. Only the duration of spouse absence is recorded, not the actual dates. This prevents the
construction of the theoretically appropriate variable, a time-varying indicator for husband’s presence. It is difficult to interpret measures which use
the total length of time spent away within the birth
interval, or the ratio of time away to the length of
the interval, since these measures confound an explanatory variable with the dependent variable of
interest.

Fecundability and Husband’s Age

techniques are required to accommodate the fixed-length sampling window,
but these changes are straightforward.

We adopt the variant of hazard modelling known as proportional hazards.
Let X denote a set of covariates fixed at
the start of each birth interval (e.g.,
woman’s age, partner’s age, and the
like). The risk of conception at duration
t within the interval is

r(X) = ro(HO(X) ,

where rg is an underlying or baseline risk
function depending only on duration f¢,
and @(X) = exp(X'8). As its name suggests, in this specification a change in the
level of a covariate X; exerts a constant
proportional impact on the level of the
conception risk irrespective of duration.

As is well known, the hazard function
bears a simple relation to the proportion
of intervals surviving to any particular
length t. The survivor function S can be
written as

S(X) = exp{- {r(s1X) ds}
= S()°,
where Sp is a baseline survivor function
So(t) = exp{- fro(s) ds}.

These relations are used, in conjunction
with the relationship between the hazard and density functions, in maximumlikelihood estimation of hazards
models. In cases in which the X covariates are time-varying (e.g., breastfeeding, post-partum abstinence) the formulas are slightly altered.

To make full use of the information
provided by the sampling window we
must consider two types of birth intervals: those in progress at the beginning
of the window, and those which are initiated within the sampling window. Figure 1 illustrates the point. The fertility

history depicted consists of a first birth
at time 0, a point falling outside the sampling window, and a conception at time t
leading to a second birth at time t+9.
The first interval of interest, of total
length t, is a closed interval while the
second Is right-censored at the interview
date rt.

The right-censored interval can be
handled in the conventional manner;
only the straddling interval requires special treatment. The straddling interval
enters the sampling window at duration
t,. Of all intervals which begin at point 0,
only a fraction S(t,) survive to contribute exposure within the window. The
probability contribution of the straddling interval is therefore the conditional density of failure at duration f,
given survival to duration ¢,. That is, the
contribution of the interval to the likelihood function is

f()/S(%) = r(exp{- {r(s) ds}.

In contrast, for closed intervals which
begin within the window, this expression would be replaced by the unconditional density

for the straddling and nonstraddling
cases respectively. Clearly there are few
complications introduced by consideration of the intervals caught in progress.!4 Such intervals could of course be
ignored in estimation, but since the sampling window is only three years in
length, doing so would greatly reduce
the precision of our estimates.

The models to be discussed below
represent the baseline hazard function
ro(t) as a step function, with steps at sixmonth intervals up to month 48. The
final duration category includes months
48+. We have also experimented with a
log-logistic form for the conception hazard, but have found the flexibility of the
step function to be an advantage in this
application. All models were estimated on a micro-computer by

The treatment of straddling intervals is simple only because the starting point of each such interval is known. Cases in which the starting times
of straddling intervals are unknown must be considered within the framework of renewal theory
(Sheps and Menken, 1973), and that introduces
formidable complications.

An important finding is that the estimated effects for husband’s age, as well as for wife’s age,
were similar for the step-function and for the loglogistic hazard functions.

maximum-likelihood methods, based
on the optimization algorithms available
in GQOPT (Goldfeld and Quandt,
1972).

RESULTS

The covariates for the analysis fall
into three groups. A first set encompasses wife’s age, husband’s age, union
duration, and length of breastfeeding,
where no distinction is drawn between
full and partial feeding. These variables
are the conventional indicators of coital
frequency and abilities to conceive. A
second group consists of more refined or
experimental measures of coital frequency, some drawn from the FOTCAF
modules. Information on sexual relations at the time of survey is included,
along with data on current co-residence
and on the proportion of time within
each interval in which the husband was
away. We include the indicators of polygyny and of junior or senior wife status
in this group. A third set of variables has
to do with specific post-partum behaviors: lengths of amenorrhea and sexual
abstinence, and durations of full and
supplemented breastfeeding. Parity is
excluded from the basic set of covariates
because its inclusion in models with
wife’s age, husband’s age, and union
duration—three variables highly collinear in themselves—would make the task
of identifying separate effects more difficult.

HusBAND’S AGE, WIFE’S AGE, AND
MARRIAGE DURATION

Upon exploration of different specifications and functional forms, we found
the effects of both husband’s and wife’s
ages on the risk of conception to be most
clearly captured by categorical rather

Fecundability and Husband’s Age 157

than continuous variables. Determination of the precise nature of these categories was based on issues of sample size
considerations and observed variations
in fertility with age. We represent wife’s
age by a dichotomous variable with categories under and over age 35; and, since
husband’s age is the focus of this analysis, we represent it by three categories—
under 45, 45 to 55, and 55+. In fact, it
would have been desirable to consider
gradations of age in the 55+ range, but
the numbers of cases are too small to
permit further breakdown. Although an
alternative specification of wife’s age,
e.g., under and over 40, would clearly
affect the magnitude of the corresponding coefficient, the resulting effect on
the coefficients for husband’s age is
small. Unlike the effects of partner’s
ages, the effects of marital duration are
efficiently summarized by continuous
variables, namely duration and duration
squared. Although the individual coefficients of the duration and the durationsquared terms are not always significant,
the combined contribution of the two
terms is significant for each of the
models tested in the five surveys.

We begin with an illustrative analysis
in Table 3 which examines the separate
roles of wife’s age, husband’s age, and
union duration as determinants of the
length of the pregnancy interval. The table presents a series of models estimated
for Kenya, in which the effects of adding
covariates can be clearly seen. In these
models breastfeeding is treated as a categorical time-varying covariate. So long
as breastfeeding continues, it has the effect on conception risks represented by
its coefficient. When breastfeeding
ends, the effect on conception is removed (i.e., the breastfeeding dummy
variable goes to 0). Full and partial
breastfeeding are not distinguished, nor

The estimates shown in the table are
derived from a log-linear fit of the hazard function. Hence, estimates of the effect of each of the covariates on the

a peak at months 12-18. For example,
for the first model, the monthly probability of conception (for women who do
not breastfeed and have younger husbands) rises from 0.077 in the period 06 months after birth to a maximum of
0.104 in the period 12-18 months after
birth and then declines steadily at higher
durations. Although the reasons for the

initial rise in the risk of conception are
not clear (i.e., they could be a function
of increasing coital frequency with time
since the last birth, the result of inadequate controls for the length of the nonsusceptible period, or a true biological
effect), the declining risks after 18
months are almost certainly due in large
part to the progressive removal from exposure of the more fecund women.

The first column of Table 3, labeled
Model I, shows the influence of husband’s age on conception risks, with the
comparison to conception risks in unions with men younger than 45. In
Model I, neither union duration nor
wife’s age enters the specification, and
the influence of husband’s age appears
to be quite strong. Unions with men 4555 are characterized by conception risks
only 0.6 = exp (-0.501) of those in
households with men under 45. We cannot effectively distinguish the effects of
still older ages of the husband—in the
range 55 and older—from those for the
age category 45-55.

Fecundability and Husband’s Age

159

As union duration and wife’s age are
added, in Models II and III, the effects
of husband’s age are progressively attenuated. The third column of Table 3
shows that unions with husbands aged
45-55 display a risk of conception only
about 15 per cent lower than would be
typical for husbands under 45.

The progressive attenuation of the effects of husband’s age is found in each of
our study countries. Table 4 summarizes
the results in terms of relative risks. Estimates for the two categories of husband’s age are presented first for models
that contain husband’s age alone (along
with breastfeeding and duration since
last birth); in the second panel union duration is added to the model; and in the
third panel, wife’s age. The addition of
wife’s age and duration weaken the effects of husband’s age to the extent that
husband’s age remains significant in
only two countries: Kenya and Syria.
The magnitude of the effect of husband’s age varies considerably across
countries. In Ghana, the impact of older

age of husbands is trivial, a relative reduction in conception risk of about 5 per
cent, whereas in Syria, couples in which
the husbands are ages 45-55 and 55+
have conception risks 31 per cent and 23
per cent lower than couples in which the
husband is under 45.

Of course husband’s age, wife’s age,
and union duration are highly interrelated, and one would expect the estimates for any one country to display
considerable instability. The interesting
aspect of the results is therefore the
broad similarity in findings across countries: the very large reductions in conception risk for older husbands (ranging
from 27 per cent to 52 per cent of the risk
of younger husbands) when only husband’s age is included in the model, and
the much more moderate reductions
when both age of the wife and the duration of union are included as well.

To what extent might these relatively
weak effects of husband’s age be due to
data imputation? Two kinds of imputation should be distinguished: randomized imputation, in which husband’s age
is given correctly on average; and imputation in which there is a systematic deviation of recorded from actual ages.
Even in the case in which measurement
error is On average zero, its existence
would weaken the estimated effects of
husband’s age on fecundability. When
imputation is systematic, parameter estimates are biased in general, although
in this case it is difficult to say whether
the husband’s age coefficients would
necessarily be biased toward zero.

POLYGYNY

In Table 5 the polygyny variable is introduced for the three countries in
which it is measured. The comparable
models for the Sudan and Syria, without
the polygyny variable, are also pre
Social Biology

sented. In our samples, polygyny is statistically significant only in Kenya. The
negative differential for Kenya is consistent with findings from Pebley and Mbugua (1989), who conclude that it is the
result of lower fecundability for senior
wives.!6 Pebley and Mbugua also find no
net effect of polygyny in Ghana, but
their results show a significant negative
differential in the Ivory Coast. The coefficient on polygyny in our Ivory Coast
sample is negative, but not significant.
The difference in findings can be attributed to sample composition. Pebley and
Mbugua use a sample which includes
households without reports on husband’s age. In a sample restricted to
those reporting husband’s age, they
find, as we do, no discernible effect of
polygyny.

It is interesting to note that, in
Kenya, the inclusion of a vanable for
polygyny alters the coefficients for the
dummy variables describing husband’s
age. A comparison of coefficients and tstatistics between the model in Table 3
(Model III) and that in Table 5 indicates
a substantial reduction in coefficients for
both age groups of husband, with the
coefficient for the age group 55+ losing
its significance. This result is not altogether surprising since the two variables
are highly correlated. Older husbands
are much more likely than younger husbands to have more than one wife.

The results from the models tn Table
5 are presented in terms of relative risks
in Table 6. The baseline for the comparisons is a monogamous union at duration
zero, with a wife under 35 and a husband
under 45; breastfeeding duration is fixed

Further analysis, not shown here, indicated
that junior wives are Statistically indistinguishable
from wives in mongamous marriages, once other
factors are controlled.

at 12 months. The largest effect on husband’s age (in Syria) implies reductions
of the risk of conception of about 30 per
cent for husbands 45-55, relative to this
baseline. The country with the next largest negative impact of husband’s age on
conception risk is the Ivory Coast, with
an estimate of 18 per cent for husbands

55 and older. Note, however, that this

duration is also large in comparison to
the influence of husband’s age, and, especially at the higher durations, in comparison to the effect of the wife’s age.
This latter result is not surprising in view
of a previous study of fecundability
based on 20 World Fertility Surveys

that marriage duration had a much
stronger effect on the waiting time to
conception than did wife’s age (and parity).

orrhea and abstinence. The selection of
one or another of these measures made
little difference to the estimates of husband’s age coefficients or to those of
wife’s age and marriage duration.

A measure of temporary separation
of husband and wife—the per cent of the
birth interval the husband spent away—
had the expected negative association
with the conception risk, with the coefficients being significant in several of the
countries. An important limitation of
this variable, however, is the fact that
we do not have information as to which
months were characterized by separation of the spouses; thus, this variable
acts as a rather poor proxy for marital
exposure or coital frequency (see Footnote 12).

In the case of Kenya, the currentstatus measure of sexual activity proved
to have a perverse association with the
conception hazard. For women who reVol. 36, No. 3-4

ported that they had not had recent sexual relations, the estimated conception
hazard was higher. This apparent violation of common sense has a simple explanation. In societies which practice
post-natal abstinence, many women
currently abstaining from sexual intercourse have had a recent birth. One’s
current status in regard to sexual relations is in part an outcome of past fertilwn ity; therefore it cannot be viewed as a
S fixed characteristic in models of conception.

CONCLUSIONS

The conventional wisdom concerning male age and fecundability is that the
© effects of male age are generally small in
relation to the influences of marital duration and the age of the woman. In a
sense, our results simply confirm this
view.
— Our findings are summarized in the
¢ five graphs shown as Figure 2. These
% figures examine the median number of
5 © months from the previous birth to the
5 next conception for union durations
> ranging from 0 to 25 years and for four
s combinations of wife’s age and hus3 band’s age. These numbers are median
g survival times calculated from the final
= models shown in Table 5, based on mo& nogamous unions and a fixed duration
of breastfeeding of 12 months.

One striking result is the extent of
variation in the waiting time to conception across countries, after one controls
for the specified covariates. In particular, for union duration zero and the
youngest age categories for both
spouses, the waiting times range from
only 15 months in Syria to as much as 24
months in Ghana; the other three countries have values between 17 and 19
months. The very high implied level of

fecundability for Syria was also noted by
Goldman et al. (1987) for both of the
Middle Eastern countries (Syria and
Jordan) in their study.

The graphs confirm the findings
noted earlier, but show the effects of age
and duration in terms of average waiting
times instead of relative risks. When one
considers durations of union greater
than 10 or 15 years, the dominating effects of union duration over age are evident for all of the surveys. The very
modest effects of husband’s age in most
of the surveys is also evident. In all
countries except Syria, the difference in
waiting time between husbands under
45 and those aged 45-55 is only about
one to two months at most durations; in
Syria, the increase is about three to five
months at intermediate durations of
marriage. The effect of wife’s age is considerably greater than that of husband’s
age in Ghana, the Ivory Coast, and Sudan. The figures also indicate that the effect of husband’s age is of about the
same magnitude as the effect of wife’s
age in both Kenya and Syria.

Although we might have found a
stronger effect of husband’s age if our
samples had contained older ages of
partners, we would argue that such an
effect would be of little demographic
significance. Husbands older than 60 are
relatively unlikely even in these populations to have wives who are of reproductive age. Hence, the resulting impact on
fertility is likely to be very small.

The apparently strong effect of husband’s age in Syria, as well as the high
level of fecundability, remains a puzzle.
Although a detailed investigation of the
Syrian case is beyond the scope of the
paper, we suspect that the result may be
related to different patterns of coresidence, separation between spouses, and
coital frequency (including voluntary

Clearly, more research is required to determine which behavioral or biological
