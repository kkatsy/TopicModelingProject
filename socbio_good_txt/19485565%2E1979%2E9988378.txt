Among Foreign-born Women

ABSTRACT: This study of 766 black women confirms and partially explains reports of higher birth
weights among foreign-born women. Subjects were new registrants for prenatal care at a public
clinic in Harlem, New York City, 1971-73, and part of a randomized trial of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy. Three nativity groups were represented: New York City, southern United
States, and foreign countries. Despite standard selection of all subjects for high risk of low birth
weight, foreign-born women had only 3.8 per cent of births under 2,500 grams in contrast with 15.6
per cent among the southern-born and 18.4 per cent among the NYC-born women, Six sets of variables were examined in relation to the birth-weight outcome. An average birth-weight advantage of
218 grams for the foreign-born was found to be associated with higher childhood social! status and

more positive health behaviors.

Socioeconomic variation in rates of low
birth weight have long been recognized
(Woodbury, 1925). Although researchers
from around the world have reported
higher rates of prematurity to be associated with lower socioeconomic status
(Illsley, 1955; Morris and Heady, 1955;
Donnelly et al., 1964; Crump et al., 1957;
Kessner, 1973; Venkatachalam, 1962;
Meredith, 1970; Kovar, 1968; Latham and
Robson, 1966), we do not yet understand
the mechanisms by which socioeconomic
status is translated into pregnancy outcome. Clearly, since pregnancy 1s a biological process, environmental influences
may be expected to operate through some
biological mechanism. An individual’s socioeconomic environment is an integral
portion of his lifetime ecologic system and
can be expected to relate to his total mental and physical growth and development.

In view of this fact, any event such as
childbearing, while occurring during a
limited segment of a woman’s life, cannot
be considered an isolated event affected
only by factors operating during the nine
months of pregnancy. Rather, such an
event reflects both life experiences up to
that point and current events.

Although researchers have attempted
to identify mechanisms by which socioeconomic status may influence birth
weight, such research has concentrated on
factors for which any biological effect is
operating around the actual time of the
pregnancy, for example, prenatal care,
childbearing patterns, and occupation of
the gravida. However, other factors such
as nutrition and infection potentially
influence biological development during
childhood (birth through puberty) as well
as during pregnancy. The relationship of

maternal height with birth weight suggests
that childhood socioeconomic status
affects the biological sequence of events
leading to final pregnancy outcome. However, the observation that maternal height
makes little if any contribution to birth
weight after controlling for maternal
weight at conception casts some doubt on
this supposition.

Studies of social mobility and pregnancy outcome (Baird and Illsley, 1953;
Isley, 1955; Baird, 1954) have considered the time during life when socioeconomic influences may be important.
Social mobility was measured in terms of
differences between the social class of the
gravida’s father and that of her husband,
using occupation as an index of social
class. Reports indicate that in this population, considerable intermarriage between
social classes does occur, although most of
the interchange occurs among adjacent
social classes. Further, women marrying
into a different social class already tended
to resemble the characteristics and life
style of members of the new class before
marriage. This observation was reflected
in measures of IQ, school leaving, her own
occupation, height, and general health.
On these measures, those women who
rose in social class at marriage were superior not only to those remaining in their
social class of upbringing but also to those
brought up in a higher class who moved
down at marriage. When prematurity
rates for women of any given origin were
compared with rates for women from a
lower class who marry up into the adjacent
class, the rates were higher for the upwardly mobile women. Similarly, women
who marry down generally retain some
effect of the lower rates of prematurity
seen in their original class compared with
women originating in the lower class.

Drillien (1957) also examined the relationship of fathers’ and husbands’ social
class to prematurity and concluded that

Maternal Characteristics and Birth Weight 199

social class of awoman’s father has a much
greater influence on her risk of producing
a premature baby than does the social
class of her husband, particularly for a first
pregnancy. This conclusion was based on
two separate analyses, mean social class
differences between premature and mature births, and a correlation and regression analysis which consistently produced
statistically significant results for father’s
social class, but not for husband’s social
class.

Two recent studies in New York City
have shown that foreign-born women,
black and white, have more favorable
pregnancy outcomes than do native-born
women (Erhardt and Chase, 1973;
Kessner et al., 1973). Education, the only .
measure of socioeconomic status available
to these two studies, did not explain this
advantage, and no other explanation has
been established. Our observation, leading to the study reported here, was that recent changes in U.S. immigration laws,
such as those requiring marketable job
skills, increase the likelihood that immigrants come from at least middle-class socioeconomic status.

The current study was designed to reexamine the question of foreign-born advantage in connection with two outcomes,
length of gestation and birth weight. The
population to be examined is not representative of New York City women, nor
even of its black women, but the social and
biological information available on each
pregnancy is extensive. It therefore
seemed useful to see whether foreignborn women in this sample maintained
their advantage and, if they did, to set up
and test a model which might help to explain the finding. This model would include measures of socioeconomic status,
nutrition, and health behaviors. We hypothesized that a birth-weight advantage
for the foreign-born women would be associated with a higher social class of ori

gin, higher current socioeconomic status,
better nutrition, and more positive health
behaviors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects for this study were 766 registrants for prenatal care in a New York City
public clinic, who were black, whose
birthplace was known, who remained active to delivery, and delivered live-born
singletons. The vast majority successfully
completed the treatment regimen. They
were participants in the Prenatal Project,
a randomized, controlled trial of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy.
Among new registrants at the clinic, those
women weighing less than 140 pounds and
registering before the thirtieth week of
pregnancy were recruited to the project if
they were free of medical problems which
might either contraindicate dietary supplements (e.g., diabetes) or which might
make interpretation of dietary effects
difficult (e.g., narcotic usage). In addition, the women had to meet at least one
of three additional criteria which were
thought to place them at high risk of having a low—birth-weight infant. These three
criteria were (1) low prepregnant weight
(less than 110 pounds) and/or low weight
gain between conception and recruitment,
(2) a previous history of low-birth-weight
infant, and (3) a history of protein intake
less than 50 grams in the twenty-four
hours prior to registration. Within each of
the seven strata defined by all combinations of these three criteria, women were
randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: high protein (supplement:40
grams protein and 474 calories per day);
balanced (complement: 6 grams of protein
and 322 calories per day); or nonbeverage controls who continued with the
same vitamin-mineral capsules given to all
clinic patients (Rush et al., 1974).

Social Biology

The resulting Project sample, all current residents of New York City, came
from a variety of geographical origins, but
three major classifications were represented: (1) New York City, (2) southern
United States, including Arkansas, Alabama, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and
West Virginia, (3) foreign countries, primarily the Virgin Islands, other Caribbean countries, South America, and
Africa. These three classifications included 97.2 per cent of the total Prenatal
Project study population. The remaining
2.8 per cent, a heterogeneous group from
all the remaining U.S. states, did not resemble any of the other three cohorts on a
variety of social and demographic characteristics. Since this group was too small to
form a fourth cohort, they were not included in this study. Of the 766 women in
the present study, 418 (55 per cent) were
from New York City, predominately
Harlem, 269 (35 per cent) were from
southern states, and 79 (10 per cent) were
foreign born. The random assignment to
treatment group resulted in no statistically
significant difference in the distributions
for the three nativity cohorts by treatment
group.

Social history data for the Prenatal Project study population were collected
shortly after registration at the prenatal
clinic and subsequent enrollment in the
project. Trained health aides interviewed
the mother at her home using a standard
social history questionnaire developed for
the Project. Data on physical characteristics such as height and skinfold measures
were taken by the Project nurse. Twentyfour-hour quantitative dietary recalls
were collected at scheduled points
throughout pregnancy by graduate nutri

tionists. Birth weight and other relevant
medical data were obtained from the hospital records.

Figure 1 sets out the causal sequence
we hypothesized to explain relationships
of various factors known to be associated
with birth weight. This sequence attempts
to consider mechanisms by which social
differences may be translated into biological outcomes. Thus, if our foreign-born
women were to show more favorable
pregnancy outcomes than their nativeborn counterparts, we expected that they
should be of higher childhood social status. Such advantage on childhood social
status should be reflected in advantages on
indices of early nutrition, nutrition at conception and during pregnancy, measures
of health behavior, and current socloeconomic status.

In Table 1, we list operational
definitions of the groups of variables to be
used for testing this hypothesis. The social
history questionnaire yielded information
relating to the two types of socioeconomic
measures. Childhood social status is
defined in terms of usual occupation of the
gravida’s parents. Current socioeconomic
status includes six measures, gravida’s occupation, occupation of husband (or
baby’s father), welfare status, education
of gravida and her husband, and per capita

income. Occupation was classified as follows: Class I, owner-proprietors, professional and managerial personnel; Class II,
skilled workers, craftsmen, clerical and
white-collar service groups; Class IT,
semi-skilled workers; and Class IV, unskilled workers and service occupations.

Height was used to define early nutrition. Triceps skinfold, which remains relatively stable even during the course of
pregnancy (Hytten and Leitch, 1971),
served as an operational index of general
nutrition at conception. Although arm
girth and subscapular skinfolds were
measured at the time of prenatal registration, they were not included in this analysis since they change during pregnancy,
and the time of gestation at registration
was not standardized. Prepregnant weight
is asecond measure of nutrition at conception. Average daily protein and calorie intake, calculated from 24-hour nutritional
histories, measure nutrition during pregnancy.

Cigarette smoking, time of registration
at the prenatal clinic, and planning of the
pregnancy were measures‘of health behaviors thought possibly to be related to
pregnancy outcome. Can count, a

RESULTS

Mean birth weights of the three nativity
groups are shown in Table 2. Foreignborn women are at a clear advantage. The
mean birth weight of this group is 218
grams higher than that of the next highest
group, the southern-born women, a statistically significant difference (p<0.001).
Mean birth weights for the southern and
New York City cohorts differed by only 48
grams.

More important than the statistically
significant difference in birth weight for
the foreign-born women is the biological
significance of the difference. The original
intervention study chose to test for an in
crease of 120 grams in birth weight, feeling
that such an increase would be biologically
meaningful since birth weight discrepancies between the offspring of cigarette
smokers and nonsmokers and between
American blacks and whites of similar social status are in this range. Further, sucha
change in mean birth weight was expected
to nearly eliminate the difference in black
and white perinatal mortality rates (Rush
et al., 1974). The 218 gram advantage of
the foreign-born is 80 per cent higher than
the 120 gram figure.

Age of women in the three cohorts
ranged from 14 to 45 years. The New York
City group was the youngest, with a mean
age of 20.1 years. Southern women were
intermediate at 23.0 years and the foreign
women, the oldest at 24.3 years. The birth

was sustained in all age categories except
for the under-17 age group which contains
only one foreign-born woman (Figure 2).
Age-adjusted birth weights were 2,962
grams, 2,971 grams, and 3,129 grams for
the New York City, southern, and foreign
groups respectively. Even after adjusting
for the age differences, the foreign women
show a 158 gram superiority over the next
closest group, a biologically significant
difference.

Gestation at delivery was 5 days longer
on the average for the foreign-born cohort. Only 11.4 per cent of the foreign women delivered prior to 37 weeks. This
figure contrasts with 24.3 per cent for the
other cohorts (p<0.001). Within gestation
categories, foreign-born women retain

their birth-weight superiority, particularly
for. the shorter gestation periods. Under
37 weeks gestation, the foreign-born hold
an advantage of about 400 grams over the
other cohorts, while over 37 weeks gestation the advantage is whittled to about 160
grams.

NATIVITY AND CHILDHOOD FACTORS

Childhood social status was represented by a wide range of parental occupations. Table 3 gives the distributions of
parents’ occupations by nativity cohort
(I = highest, IV = lowest). Over onethird of the New York City group and
nearly one-third of the southern women
did not know their father’s occupation.

per cent did not know their father’s occupation. Among those for whom father’s
occupation was known, the occupational
distributions differed significantly for the
three groups (X?= 179.3; p<0.0001). The
fathers of the foreign-born women clearly
were engaged in higher status occupations
than those of the other two cohorts. The
foreign cohort also had fewer mothers in
the lowest occupational classification.
Thus, the foreign-born cohort represents
a higher childhood social status in comparison with the two native-born cohorts.

Birth weight showed a positive linear
relationship with both father’s and
mother’s occupation for the foreign women, but not for the native-born women.
Within occupational classes, mean birth
weight was consistently highest for the foreign-born women, although not statistically significant in all classes.

CURRENT SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS

The study population was recruited
from a public prenatal clinic. This limited
the variation of current socioeconomic
status. It is interesting to note that the six
measures of social status are not comparable across nativity groups (Tables 4 and 5).
Some of the differences, such as in
subject’s education, are related to age
differences in the cohorts. Many of the
New York City women are young enough
not to have finished high school. In addition to age, there are effects of place of
childhood residence on education. The
foreign-born women, despite their relatively higher childhood social class, have a
lower mean education level (10.6 years)
than do other groups(p<0.001). While
foreign-born subjects had less education
than their native-born counterparts, their

‘husband had more education (p<0.001).

The occupational classifications of the foreign-born subjects also tended to be
slightly lower than those of the nativeborn. However, education and occupation for the foreign women were inconsistent with other social class measures.
Among the foreign-born women, per capita income, like husband’s education,
was higher, and none of this group was on
welfare. In contrast, more than 25 per cent
of the native women were on welfare.
Thus, years of education is an incomplete
and even misleading measure of social status for the foreign women, since it is inconsistent with other measures reflecting
childhood and current family social status.
Among the current social variables, only
welfare status and educational attainment
of the gravida’s husband showed the expected relationship with birth weight for
all three groups. The gravida’s educational attainment was related for the New
York City and southern-born groups but
not for the foreign-born women.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Since age and body weight are known
to be related, with younger women generally being lighter than older women, we
anticipated that the New York cohort
might tend to be lighter and thinner than

the other groups, perhaps being overselected by the recruitment criteria relating
to body weight.

Table 6 shows the mean values for the
biological indices of nutrition. The foreign-born women are slightly shorter and
heavier than the women in the other two
groups. The differences are not, however,
statistically significant. It therefore appears that the recruitment criteria of the
study successfully selected, across nativity
groups, women of similar physical characteristics. However, it could be argued that
light weight older women might be at
higher risk of low birth weight than light
weight young women Since mean maternal
weight tends to increase slightly with age.
Since this difference should have the effect
of increasing the risk of low birth weight
among the foreign women and thus decreasing their advantage over the other
groups, their large birth weight advantage
is the more impressive.

pregnancy outcome. Only cigarette smoking and marital status show any statistically significant differences among the
three cohorts, although a greater proportion of the foreign women consistently ex
hibit the more positive values on these 
health behaviors. Their dietary histories
also showed less fluctuation over time.
About 10 per cent more of the foreign women planned their pregnancies than did
women of the other two cohorts. In line
with this, parity is lower among the foreign women despite their older mean age.
Half of the foreign-born women and 44
per cent of the southern-born women report current marital status as either married or divorced, separated or widowed.
Among the New York City group, however, less than 25 percent have ever been
married.

Smoking was clearly different in the
three groups (Table 7). Among foreignborn women, smoking is virtually nonexistent. Only 5 per cent of the foreign cohort
were smokers at registration, in contrast
with 31 per cent of the southern and 65 per
cent of the New York City women
(p<0.001). Southern-born smokers used
more Cigarettes. Thirty-seven per cent of

_southern-born smokers reported smoking

more than ten cigarettes daily compared
to 22 per cent of the New York City smokers.

Birth weight, as expected, is highest in
nonsmokers and lowest in heavy smokers.
Within each smoking category, however,
foreign-born women have the highest
birth weight (Figure 4), maintaining at
least 171 grams advantage over the next
closest group. Smoking, therefore, contributes to the birth-weight differences but
does not explain them.

DISCUSSION

As hypothesized, foreign-born women
came from a higher social class origin than
did the other two cohorts. Thus, nativity,
in this study, could be used as representative of different childhood socioeconomic
experiences. Even within the restricted
range of current socioeconomic status represented in this population, the early social class advantage of the foreign-born
women is maintained on such measures of
current status as husband’s occupation,
per capita income, and welfare status.
While the social class advantage is not
reflected in statistically significant
differences in height, prepregnant weight,

or triceps skinfolds, these women do
maintain a more consistent nutritional intake, are more likely to show “positive”
health behaviors such as nonsmoking and
planning of pregnancies, and for those assigned to treatment group, to use more of
the beverage. The lack of statistically significant differences in the anthropometric measures representing nutrition in
childhood and at conception is likely due
to selection procedures of the experimental study, which as noted, would have minimized such differences.

It is interesting that higher social class
(judged both by childhood social status
and by current socioeconomic status) was
associated with higher birth weight for the
foreign-born group only. This may have
been due in part to the fact that, while variance on social class was limited in all
groups, childhood social class, in particu
lar, was less restricted among the foreign
women. Limited variance on the social
variables could be expected to weaken the
chance of finding a relationship to birth
weight.

Interpretation of social variables in
comparing groups from different cultures
presents difficulties. The lower mean education level of the foreign-born gravida,
despite their advantage on other measures
of current social status, probably reflects
the fact that even today in many developing countries, middle-class women do not
have the equivalent of a high-school education. For this group, education is a misleading indicator of socioeconomic status.
Welfare status also may be difficult to interpret since migrant groups, such as the
southern and foreign-born women, must
first meet residency criteria to become eligible.

Similarly, the lack of association of
birth weight with childhood social status
within the native-born groups may reflect
disadvantage in this country at the time
the women were growing up. Thus, parental occupation may be a poor reflection of
childhood social status for native-born
blacks, being inconsistent with other
measures such as parental education.

Because of the relative youth of the
New York City cohort, current measures
of social status, in reality, probably
measure both childhood and current environment since they are the same for that
portion of the group who still live at home.
As aresult of their young age and the common pattern in Harlem of pregnant teenaged girls living with their mothers, many
of the New York City women in the study
population do live with at least one
parent.

The birth-weight advantage of the foreign-born women thus appears related, in
part, to their higher social class of origin
which, in turn, is reflected in higher current SES and positive health behaviors related to the pregnancy experience, particularly smoking status. It should be noted
that, in general, the foreign-born women
were fairly representative of foreign-born,
pregnant, black women registered at the
municipal hospital prenatal clinic under
study while the New York City southern
women are less well off than the clinic population from which they were drawn. This
discrepancy may have resulted in part
from the fact that a higher proportion of
the foreign-born women were recruited by
the diet criterion (a history of protein intake less than 50 grams in 24 hours prior to
registration at prenatal clinic) in contrast
with the New York women in the study
who were recruited more frequently on
the low prepregnant weight and previous
low-birth-weight infant criteria. Since the

 

Maternal Characteristics and Birth Weight 209

foreign-born group is more varied and
more representative of the population
from which they were drawn, a finding of
relationships in the group suggests that
similar relationships should be found in a
more general population sample.

This finding of more positive health behavior and of a correlation between SES
and positive health behaviors in the foreign group is a point for prevention, as
these represent factors modifiable within
the existing structure of public health resources. A next important step is to examine the relationship of health behaviors
to each of the other variable sets and to
quantify their relative unique contribution
to birth weight. Since nativity here appears to represent different socioeconomic experiences in childhood, the
relative contributions of links in the causal
chain should vary by nativity cohort. It
may be, for example, that with a better
childhood socioeconomic background,
the women are in better general physiological condition and may be less affected
either positively or negatively by current
socioeconomic status or nutritional status
than those from poorer beginnings.
Identification of such relationships should
clarify preventive issues. Results of our
multivariate analysis will be reported in a
subsequent paper.
