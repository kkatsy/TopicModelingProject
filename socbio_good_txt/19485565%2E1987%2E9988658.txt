Factors Influencing Decisions to Terminate Life

ABSTRACT: The present study attempted to identify situations that would lead subjects to endorse euthanasia when no implicit assumption about the inevitability of death was made. Participants in the study were 54 males and 47 females enrolled in introductory psychology courses
at the University of California, Los Angeles. Subjects indicated how likely they would be to
endorse euthanasia in specific hypothetical situations for themselves and for each of their parents. When a factor analysis was conducted on the self situations, four factors were identified:
(1) physical condition and pain; (2) external sanction, financial hardship, and emotional stress;
(3) mental alertness; and (4) lowered expectation of recovery. A factor analysis was also conducted on the parents’ situations and four slightly different factors were obtained. The results
indicate that different decisional criteria are used for self than for parents. Also, the decision to
terminate another’s life appears to involve the consideration of more factors than the decision to
terminate one’s own life. Neither sex nor religious affiliation differences were found to be related
to the endorsement of euthanasia. However, a significant relationship was found between endorsement of euthanasia and low scores on a religiosity measure when subjects were divided
into low and high scorers.

ers were only interested in basic
demographic differences (Cappon,
1970; Jorgenson and Neubecker, 1981;
Ostheimer, 1980). Results indicated
that people were generally against any
form of active euthanasia but were more
accepting of passive euthanasia. Highly
religious people were found to be less
approving of euthanasia than people
with few or no religious beliefs (Feifel
and Schag, 1980; Kalish, 1963).

Although results are inconsistent,
some religious affiliation differences
have been reported. Some studies
showed that Catholics and Jews tended
to hold more negative attitudes toward
euthanasia than Protestants (Feifel and
Schag, 1980; Kalish, 1963; Singh, 1979),
whereas Ostheimer’s survey results
(1980) indicated that Jews were more
likely to advocate euthanasia than Protestants and Catholics.

Ethnic differences have also been reported. Feifel and Schag (1980) found
Caucasians more accepting of euthanasia than Blacks and Mexican-Americans. Jorgenson and Neubecker (1981)
also found Caucasians more accepting
of euthanasia than were minorities. In
their study, however, ethnic differences
could not be determined because ethnicity was categorized into two groups:
“White” and “‘Black and other.” Generally, no sex differences in attitudes towards euthanasia have been found (Kalish, 1963; Ostheimer, 1980), although
Jorgenson and Neubecker (1981) did
find males somewhat more accepting of
euthanasia than females.

In previous studies, when people
were asked about their attitudes toward
euthanasia, multiple aspects of the proposed euthanasia situation were combined (Jorgenson and Neubecker, 1981;
Kearl and Harris, 1981; Nagi and Lazerine, 1982; Ostheimer, 1980). For ex
Social Biology

ample, in Kearl and Harris’s study
(1981), one question asked was: ‘““When
a person has a disease that cannot be
cured, do you think doctors should be
allowed by law to end the patient’s life
by some painless means if the patient
and his family request it?” This question
presents several different aspects of the
portrayed situation: (1) the disease is incurable; (2) termination is legal; and (3)
the patient and his family request termination. One is not able to determine
whether the person advocates euthanasia based upon the incurable-disease
component (i.e., inevitability of death),
the legal component (i.e., social sanction), the patient-and-family’s request
component (i.e., freedom of choice), or
some unique combination of the three.
A study by Nagi and Lazerine (1982)
did attempt to identify specific conditions under which members of the clergy
would justify passive euthanasia for the
terminally ill. The purpose of Nagi and
Lazerine’s study was to determine
whether death education and deathcounseling training affected the decision
process. No definitive conclusions about
death education and death-counseling
training could be drawn from their
results because they found more withingroup than between-group variation.
However, they did conclude that religious affiliation (e.g., Catholic or Jewish) was not a critical variable in the decision process. In one of their
conditions, Nagi and Lazerine asked
members of the clergy whether they
would justify passive euthanasia in the
case of “intolerable pain and psychological strain.” Again, different aspects of
the person’s situation (e.g., ““psychological strain” and “intolerable pain”) were
presented as if they were a single factor.
As in the Kearl and Harris study, one
cannot determine whether subjects adDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

vocated euthanasia based upon the intolerable-pain aspect, the psychologicalstrain aspect, or some unique combination of the two. In addition, Nagi and
Lazerine had members of the clergy assume that the person was terminally ill.

The present study attempted to expand upon the conditions presented in
Nagi and Lazerine’s study and to clarify
the individua] factors which influence
people’s decisions to terminate life. Specific situations were to be considered
separately with no implicit assumption
about the inevitability of death. Although decisions to terminate life may
be affected by whether the euthanasia is
presented as active, passive, voluntary,
or involuntary, these factors were not
studied here. Subjects were asked to indicate which specific situations would
justify euthanasia for themselves and for
each of their parents. To the authors’
knowledge, no previous research has
studied attitudes about euthanasia for
parents. A parent condition was included in this study to present subjects
with a realistic situation with which they
might some day be confronted. The
present study thus examined whether
people would endorse euthanasia in different situations for themselves than
they would for their mothers or their fathers.

Another purpose of the study was to
determine if religiosity affected the decision. That is, would low and high scorers
on a religious measure differ in their
likelihood to endorse euthanasia and in
the circumstances under which they
would do so?

courses at the University of California,
Los Angeles, participated in this study
(N=101). Two-thirds of the subjects
were college freshmen and sophomores.
The rest of the sample was made up of
20 juniors, 10 seniors, and 1 graduate
student. The ethnic composition of the
sample was: 52 Whites, 24 Asians, 11
Blacks, 9 Mexican Americans, 1 Native
American, and 1 Middle Easterner.
Self-reported religious affiliation resulted in 27 subjects identifying themselves as having few or no religious beliefs, 25 Protestants, 22 Roman Catholics, 17 Jews, and 10 of other backgrounds (e.g., Eastern Orthodox,
Mormon, Buddhist, Hindu, or Islam).

MEASURES

Faulkner and DeJong’s religious
measure (1965) was selected for this
study because it was originally developed with a college population. It is also
considered a useful general measure of
religiosity (Robinson and Shaver,
1973).

PROCEDURE

A questionnaire containing hypothetical euthanasia situations based
upon situations used in other studies was
constructed by the experimenters. The
questionnaire was pretested on 18 students in introductory psychology
courses at the University of California,
Los Angeles, and was modified as a
result of the pilot testing (see Table 1).
When subjects were asked to consider
euthanasia for each parent, a situation
was added which did not appear when
the subjects were asked to consider euthanasia for themselves (i.e., if the
mother/father expresses a wish to die).

The questionnaire, which took 20
minutes to complete, included: (1) demographic information (e.g., sex, ethnic

recommend euthanasia both for themselves and for their parents. Subjects
also slightly endorsed euthanasia for
themselves in Situation 2 (i.e., “diagnosed as mentally incapacitated”) and
for parents in Situation 17 (i.e., mother/
father tells you that she/he wishes to
die).

A t-test was conducted between subject’s ratings for all the mother items
and subject’s ratings for all the father
items. Although there is a slight tendency to advocate euthanasia under
more situations for mother than for father, there was no significant difference
between the two groups, t(99) = —1.24,
p>0.05. Because of this finding, the ratings for mother and father were combined into one parents’ rating for all subsequent analyses.

A t-test was also conducted between
the subject’s ratings for all self items and
his or her ratings for all parents items.
There was a significant difference be
tween subject’s self ratings (M = —0.93)
and parents’ ratings (M = —1.59),
t(95) = 8.46, p<0.001. Thus, across all
situations, subjects were more likely to
recommend euthanasia for themselves
than for their parents.

Tables 3 and 4 present the results of a
factor analysis for the self and the parents’ euthanasia situations respectively.
Initially, a criterion of a factor loading of
0.6 or higher was used to include a situation to define a factor. If no situations
loaded at 0.6, the highest loadings above
0.35 were used. If a euthanasia situation
loaded high on two or more factors, it
was assigned to the factor where it
yielded the most conceptual purity. For
example, parents’ Situation 14 (1.e., termination is sanctioned by physician)
loads highest on Factor 3 (0.492), but
was included under Factor 4 (0.424) because it relates more to external sanction than it does to mental alertness or
parents’ wish. As a result of this proce

dure, four factors for self and four factors for parents were identified. The factors appeared to cluster around these
dimensions: (1) person-related, such as
diminished mental and physical ability
and the amount of pain experienced; (2)
how the person’s condition affects others; and (3) whether recovery was possible. The factor analysis results for the
parents showed external sanction was a
factor by itself, and the parents’ expressed wish was an additional consider
‘ation in the mental alertness factor. The

factors identified here were used in subsequent analyses by creating factor
scores for each subject. Factor scores
were the arithmetic sum of the component situations, that is, the values selected for the individual situations (—3
to +3) were summed across those situations comprising each factor.

No sex differences were found when
t-tests were conducted on the derived
factor scores. There were also no significant differences across five religious affiliations (i.e., no religious beliefs, Protestants, Catholics, Jewish, and others)
when a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was conducted on factor
scores. Since most studies have conducted analyses primarily on the major
religious groups, a separate ANOVA
was conducted on Catholics (” = 22),
Protestants (m = 22), and Jews (n = 17).
Again, no significant differences were
found.

A one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was also conducted across
ethnic groups for each factor. Since
some ethnic groups had small sample
sizes, subjects were placed in one of
three categories: Asian (7 = 24), White

DISCUSSION

The purpose of the study was to identify separate situations which would affect endorsement of euthanasia. Once
situations and dimensions were determined, we examined whether the decision to terminate life was similar for self,
mother, and father, and whether demographic variables or religiosity affected
this decision process.

Results indicate that when faced with
a life or death decision, men and women
respond similarly. This result is consistent with the findings of other researchers. Subjects used different criteria in
the decision to terminate their own lives
as opposed to their parents’ lives. The
data from the factor analysis suggest
that more variables are taken into account when one contemplates euthanasia for parents than for self in similar situations. That is, a person is more
definite about what situations would justify euthanasia for themselves, but the
decision is not as clearly defined when it
involves one’s parents. This finding

makes intuitive sense since the decision
to end another person’s life is much
more complicated ethically, morally,
and legally than the decision to end
one’s own life.

Due to small sample sizes, the
present study was not able to test for
some of the ethnic differences previously reported by researchers (Feifel
and Schag, 1980; Jorgenson and
Neubecker, 1981). The analysis that was
conducted on ethnic composition (e.g.,
Asian, White, Other) found Asians and
other minorities did not endorse euthanasia to the extent that Whites did when
considering parents’ mental alertness
and wish. While this finding confirms
results of earlier studies (Feifel and
Schag, 1980; Jorgenson and Neubecker,
1981), it appears to contradict the Asian
cultural norm that children should always obey parents. Future studies need
a more representative ethnic sample to
further explore cultural differences in
advocating euthanasia.

Contrary to previous research findings and the experimenters’ expecta

Vol. 34, No. 1-2

tions, no significant differences were
found among religious affiliations. This
nonsignificant finding could be due to
the greater degree of within-group variation than between-group variation as
Nagi and Lazerine (1982) had previously found. According to the results of
the present study and Nagi and LaZerine’s study, dichotomization of religiosity (e.g., low vs. high) is more useful
in predicting a person’s decision to terminate life than religious affiliation. The
present study’s results are consistent
with the previous research finding that
highly religious people are less approving of euthanasia than people with little
or no religious beliefs. Significant differences in ratings between the lowreligiosity group and the high-religiosity
group were found for two of the four self
factors and three of the four parents’
factors.

The factor which accounted for the
most variance in the subject’s self ratings was physical condition and pain
(i.e., self Factor 1). Since subjects were
college students, people who typically
are concerned about physical health and
fitness, the finding that physical condition and pain is an important factor in
the decision to terminate life is not surprising. One must be careful, however,
not to make the assumption that the factor accounting for the most variance Is
also most important in the person’s decision to terminate life. Given the design
of the present study, this assumption
cannot be made. One can determine the
factors which account for the most variance in the decision process, but one
cannot assume their order of importance. To determine the relative importance of the euthanasia situations, future studies would need to ask subjects
to rank-order the situations from least
important to most important.

Future studies should also explore

 

Decisions to Terminate Life 45

whether euthanasia is an easier decision
for self and a more complicated decision
for all others or whether there is a further distinction between decisions for
parents/family members and decisions
for “‘generalized others.” To test this hypothesis, one would need to include a
“generalized other—male”’ category
and a “generalized other—female”’ category. Perhaps ethnic differences would
be more apparent in that cultures emphasizing close-knit family structures
(e.g., Asians and Hispanics) would differentiate between self and parents and
generalized others, while Whites might
differentiate only between self and all
others.

Finally, future studies should present
combinations of euthanasia situations to
see if they contribute additively to the
decision process. For example, if excruciating pain is combined with being
confined to bed for the rest of one’s life,
is endorsement of euthanasia under the
combined situation related to endorsement of both individual situations? That
is, can the two separate ratings be combined additively to determine a rating
that approximates the person’s endorsement of euthanasia when the two situations are presented as one?

Since society will increasingly face
the question of euthanasia, it is important to continue to study the correlates
of attitudes toward euthanasia.
