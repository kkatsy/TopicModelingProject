Spontaneous Fetal Death in Man

The sequence of events which begins
with gametic union and ends with the
birth of a living child is sometimes interrupted by fetal death. Knowledge of
the frequency with which this interruption occurs strengthens our understanding
of the reproductive process. Fetal deaths
occur principally during the earlier stages
of pregnancy, and a major proportion apparently represents elimination of abnormal fetuses (WHO, 1970). Estimates of
the loss in man range from 5% to 60%
(Figure 1). Many investigators attribute
this range of values to the biases associated with the type of data collected (c.f.,
Tietze, 1953; Warburton, 1961; James,
1970), while less attention is directed to
the impact of the form of the analysis
itself.

Recognition that pregnancies at different stages of gestation are exposed to the
risk of fetal death for unequal lengths of
time has led to the application of the life
table to generate better fetal death estimates. Life tables convert observations
made at different times to a set of agespecific probabilities. As such, they seen
ideally suited to estimate probabilities of
fetal death in man.

The earliest study of fetal death to use
a life table model derived an estimate of
23.1% fetal death based upon observed

 

sex ratios for later fetal deaths and
theoretic sex ratios for the first three
gestation months (Pfaundler, 1936). Subsequent life table studies began to incorporate pregnancies observed during the
first trimester, the result of improved
diagnostic procedures. Some studies ascertained pregnancies through health insurance plans (Shapiro, Jones, and Densen,
1962; Shapiro and Abramowicz, 1969;
Shapiro, Levine, and Abramowicz, 1970;
Taylor, 1964, 1970); some used clinically
diagnosed pregnancies (Mellin, 1962;
Pettersson, 1968; Awan, 1969); and others
incorporated a variety of detection procedures (French and Bierman, 1962;
Erhardt, 1962, 1963).

Results from selected studies (Table 1)
show that life table estimates of fetal death
need not be uniform. This variability may
be due to differences in the study designs,
true differences among the populations, or
to other factors, since the samples also
differ in a number of social and biological
parameters (e.g., social class, income,
parental ages, degree of consanguinity,
number of prior pregnancies and fetal
deaths, ethnicity, education). Although
the relative contribution to fetal death of
most of these variables is uncertain, some
(e.g., age and parity) have effects which
seem obvious. Therefore, while these pre

Fic. 1—Incidence of fetal death reported in 59 studies.

vious studies may not represent the actual
age-specific risks of fetal death, it appears
that they do confirm that the early gestation periods have the greatest fetal loss.

In the study of fetal death, life tables
reflect the interaction between two probability distributions: the chance of pregnancy termination and the chance of
pregnancy detection. The actual observation of pregnancy is a function of both
distributions. The former represents the
chance that a fetal death (or a live birth)
will occur at a particular gestation age.
The latter reflects problems of pregnancy
detection at specific gestation times and
actually has two components: (1) the
chance of detecting a pregnancy before
its termination; and (2) the chance that
the pregnancy termination itself signifies,
for the first time to an outside observer,
that the pregnancy exists.

The existence of these two probability
distributions could have introduced another
source of variability in the above studies
in that different life table models and diverse computational procedures were employed.

The object of this study is: (1) to derive
fetal death estimates as a function of different life table methods, using a common
set of data; (2) to evaluate the appropriateness of the life table models themselves;
and (3) to determine whether inclusion
or exclusion of pregnancies ascertained just
at termination critically changes estimates
of fetal mortality.

interval (the time between two successive
gestation ages), there will be /; fetal deaths,
b; live births and 2; + 4 pregnancies which
survive the interval and do not terminate:

lp=leai th +o. (1)
The probability of a fetal death in the /-th
gestation period is g; and that of a live
birth is r; Thus, the probability of not
terminating in the ¢-th interval, that is,
the chance of the pregnancy successfully
reaching the ¢-+-1 gestation age, is

bi =1—Qa— nr. (2)
It will be shown later, when the appropriate computing formulas are developed, that
estimates of g; and 7; are dependent upon
the particular life table model selected.

The probability that a fetal death will

occur sometime between one gestation age
(¢) and some later gestation age (t’) is
called the cumulative probability? and is
denoted as Q; +, where

Ose = Qe + Dede + Pebt419142

eet Pebtg1. +. de-1ge. (3)
Thus, the chance of a fetal death occurring
sometime between the start of pregnancy
and the third gestation month is

Qo,3 = Yo + PoG1 ++ Poh192

+ Pohifegs. (4)
Similar expressions can be derived for live
births if the probability of fetal death (q)
is replaced by the probability of live birth
(r) in equations (3) and (4) above.

In the following section, four life table
models will be described and defined in
the context of their application to the study
of fetal death.

TYPES OF LIFE TABLE MODELS IN
FETAL DEATH STUDIES

Life table models useful in fetal death
studies depend upon the nature of the ob1 This cumulative probability actually cumu

servations themselves. When each pregnancy is ascertained at the same gestation
age and each is followed until termination,
a cohort or generation life table can be
computed. In this case, the duration of
observation is a random variable. Here, a
set of women with positive pregnancy tests,
all in the third gestation month, could be
followed until pregnancy ends. Since the
cohort life table represents the actual pregnancy experience observed in a population,
observation begins at gestation age ¢ with
some initial population of size /; and the
number of live births, 5;, and the fetal
deaths, f;, are observed in each subsequent
gestation period (c.f., French and Bierman,
1962). Observation continues until all 2;
pregnancies have been terminated and the
live table probabilities are calculated directly from the observations:

Qt = fr/le, (5)

r= b:/l:, (6)
and

Dt = 14 1/l:. (7)

Pregnancies ascertained at different gestation ages (a cross-section) where each
pregnancy is again followed until termination, form the basis of a fusion life table,
the most commonly used model in the
study of fetal death (Erhardt, 1962, 1963;
French and Bierman, 1962; Taylor, 1964,
1970; Pettersson, 1968; Awan, 1969;
Shapiro et al., 1970). The designation
“fusion” is applied since this model combines the cohorts from month two, month
three, and so on. As a composite of several
cohort tables, the gestation age-specific
probabilities are actually the weighted
averages of the respective cohort probabilities represented in that time period.

All pregnancies used in the fusion life
table are included from their ascertainment
until termination. Newly ascertained pregnancies (which themselves constitute a

Vol. 20, No. 4

cohort) are entered into the life table when
they are first observed. Most intervals,
therefore, contain pregnancies from several different cohorts which are fused to
form a single life table entry. Each successive interval can be considered a new
cohort starting its initial exposure period
for purposes of computation. To accomodate the partial exposure of the N newly
ascertained pregnancies requires an additional term in the denominator of equations
(5) and (6):

he
= ——____, 8
dt l, + ayN, (8)
b
r= ——____.. (9)
ly + ayN;
Thus,
Pr=1l—a—nr:
_ (le41) + (ayN 2) - (10)

(Z;) ++ (ay)

The average time a pregnancy is observed in its first interval of inclusion, cy,
can either be estimated from the data directly or can be set equal to some predetermined value. When ay equals 0.05,
the distribution of the observations is considered to be uniform in the interval,
which is the assumption used by French
and Bierman (1962). When ay equals 1.0,
as was the case for Pettersson (1968), all
pregnancies are considered to enter observation at the start of the interval.?

Validity of a fusion life table requires
that the assumption of equal age-specific
termination probabilities, for each of the
contributing cohorts, be verified. This was
the case for French and Bierman (1962).
Should the contributing cohorts possess

2 Technically, since few pregnancies are actually
observed at the start of the first life table period,
the probability estimate in the first interval would
need adjustment to account for partial exposure
to termination within that interval.

 

 

Spontaneous Fetal Death 379

different age-specific probabilities, estimates from the fusion life table may be
unreliable.

If the pregnancies in a cross-section are
observed for a fixed time period, a period
life table would be indicated. Each pregnancy would be assigned to a unique
period in the life table using one of several
procedures. A prospective study would
follow a sample of pregnancies from some
population for one month, first having fixed
the gestation age of the pregnancy. For
example, if all pregnancies in an area were
studied only during the month of April,
the gestation ages of the initial observations could range from just past fertilization to ten or more lunar months. Other
types of cross-sections would be the gestation month during which prenatal care
begins or when the pregnancy is first diagnosed. A prospective study of retrospective
data (e.g., vital records, hospital records,
interview date) could use the gestation age
at which a pregnancy test was obtained
or prenatal care was started.

Regardless of the assignment procedure,
two criteria must be satisfied: (1) no pregnancy can be used in the life table for more
than one gestation period; (2) observation
must be made upon a cross-section of
gestation ages. |

The current study enters pregnancies
into the period life table based on either
of two criteria. If the time of the first
prenatal visit is known, the pregnancy is
entered at the start of the following gestation month, This ensures an observation
period of no longer than one month and
avoids additional problems associated with
partial exposure to termination during the
previous month when the first visit occurred (since the visit could have occurred
at the end of the gestation month). When
pregnancies without prenatal care are included in the analysis, they are entered
in their termination month, which assumes

 

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

380

a theoretical exposure lasting until the time
of termination?

For each gestation month, f; fetal deaths
and 6; live births occur in the interval ¢
to ¢-+-1. Of 2; pregnancies which start
the ¢-th gestation interval, 2; 441 survive
the month without terminating in either
a fetal death or live birth. These /; . 1 survivors are dropped from further consideration in the life table. Thus,

Ls = fe + 0: + lta. (11)

Estimates of g; are derived from agespecific fetal death rates. An adjustment
(ai) is needed for partial exposure to
the risk of fetal death for those pregnancies which end in a live birth during
the #-th interval. Thus,

fr
1, — b:(1 — ay)
Similarly, the estimate for 7; adjusts for

the average exposure of fetal deaths (a;;)
in the interval, and

qt = (12)

not)
ly — fr(1 — ayy)
Again,
(14)

Finally, if the pregnancies in a crosssection are analyzed as though they all
started observation at the same gestation
age (although the initial ages at entry
actually differ) a pseudo-cohort life table
results. It is so named since it appears to
be, but actually is not, a cohort life table.
For example, the date of the last menstrual period (LMP) or the date of suspected ovulation could be used as the time
of entry into the life table, even though
the pregnancies were actually brought into
the study later in gestation. Usually the

Pe =1l— Qi — rt.

- zero time is the last menstrual period

3 Month two in 1963, for example, contains 1,834
pregnancies with prenatal care and 2,123 pregnancies without prenatal care,

Abramson

Social Biology

(Mellin, 1962; Shapiro et al., 1962, 1970)
though other times, such as the date of
suspected ovulation, could be used.

Probability estimators of the pseudocohort life table are similar to those used
in the cohort life table:

Q:=fi/l's, (15)

r, = b,/l's, (16)
and

Pe=V isis, (17)

where ?’ represents the number of pregnancies in the pseudo-cohort.

This model will underestimate the agespecific probabilities since few pregnancies
start their risk period at time zero; the
risk period actually starts when the pregnancy is ascertained. An excessive number
of pregnancies are included in the denominator (/’), especially during the early
gestation periods, and the results therefore
represent minimum estimates.

For purposes of illustration, a fictitious
example is presented here which shows the
type of information employed in each
model (Table 2). This example is not meant
to reflect actual fetal death probabilities.
The underlying fetal death probabilities
are slightly different in each gestation
month to assist the reader in understanding how the models differ.

Five cohort life tables can be constructed, with 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, 8,000,
and 16,000 pregnancies respectively. A
fusion life table uses the column totals to
estimate probabilities, these totals producing a weighted estimate. A period life
table would start with the observations on
any major diagonal (which could be 1,000,
2,000, 4,000, 8,000, and 16,000 pregnancies
or 750, 1,600, 3,400, and 7,200 pregnancies
in each gestation month), and the results
would be tabulated one month later. The
pseudo-cohort life table assumes that 31,000
pregnancies began observation in month
two, of which 250 ended in fetal death.

In summary, four types of life tables can
be used to estimate fetal death probabilities. Each of the four models will now be
used to analyze a set of pregnancy records
collected in New York City.

THE DATA

The live birth and fetal death certificates filed in New York City in both 1963
and 1967 were selected for analysis because
New York City requires the reporting of
all pregnancy terminations, no matter what
their gestation age. The data were provided by the New York City Department
of Health, which routinely collects and
files the fetal death and live birth certificates. The numbers of live births and fetal
deaths reported in 1963 and 1967 are tabulated in Tables 3 and 4. The totals are
presented by gestation month of termination and gestation month of the first prenatal visit, including those without prenatal
visits and those whose prenatal visits are
not stated.

It is recognized that reporting of spontaneous fetal death is far from complete
(Erhardt, 1952) and that induced abortions may, at times, be included posing as
spontaneous terminations. This issue will
be discussed in greater detail later. However, an advantage is that large numbers
of early fetal deaths are available for analysis together with the later fetal deaths
and live births. The total number of reported pregnancies (165,000 live births
and 21,000 fetal deaths in 1963 and
142,000 live births and 18,000 fetal deaths
in 1967) is sufficiently large to minimize
sampling variance, which leaves bias as
the principal source of error.

Each certificate of pregnancy termination includes the length of pregnancy in
gestation weeks (computed from the date
of the last menstrual period to delivery),
the gestation month of the first prenatal
visit, the type of hospital in which the

Abramson

pregnancy terminated and the attendant
at that termination, as well as demographic
information including maternal age, paternal age, racial group, and the number of
previous pregnancies, abortions, live-born,
and living children.

RESULTS

A total of sixteen cohort tables (eight
for both 1963 and 1967) were computed,
each composed of those pregnancies with
prenatal care reportedly indicated in a
particular gestation month (Table 5). Although the results indicate that up to 14%
of the pregnancies end in fetal death, three
elements indicate some caution in their
interpretation. First, Erhardt (1969; unpublished memo) argues that fetal death
reporting in New York City has fallen
off in recent years. This appears to be
confirmed (assuming no decline in the actual propensity for fetal death from 1963
to 1967) in that the 1963 estimates are
almost double those for 1967. Second, a
large number of women had no apparent
prenatal care before the pregnancy termination, the majority of which were fetal
deaths. These 27,000 pregnancies in each
year represent 14.8% of the 1963 reports
and 17.1% of the 1967 reports. Since it
is impossible to determine when prenatal
care would have started, their exclusion
from the cohort analysis suggests these estimates are low. Lastly, the heterogeneity
of the gestation age-specific probabilities
within both 1963 and 1967 might point
to sampling variability, especially since the
1963 estimates generally exceed the corresponding estimates for 1967. However,
the excess could also indicate an actual
decrease in the chance of fetal death.

Omission of 15% to 20% of the recorded pregnancies based on absent or unknown prenatal care weakened the cohort
analysis. A similar effect is observed in
the pseudo-cohort analysis. When preg

* Cumulative probabilities are presented for eight cohorts in both 1963 and 1967.
Each cohort consists of women whose first prenatal visit occurred in that particular
gestation month. These figures represent the probability of fetal death from the
current gestation month to the end of pregnancy.

nancies without prenatal care are excluded,
the cumulative probability of fetal death
is less than 4% (Table 6); but, when all
terminations are included, the probability
exceeds 11%, a three-fold increase.

The fusion life table results (Table 6)
also confirm that omission of pregnancies
without prenatal care will result in diminished probability estimates. In this case,
the estimated probability of fetal death
is less than 10% when these pregnancies
are excluded and exceeds 40% when these
pregnancies are included, a four-fold increase, Therefore, like the pseudo-cohort
life table, the fusion life table responds
to how pregnancies are judged for inclusion in the analysis.

The period life table analysis encompasses gestation months two to nine since

only eight prenatal care cohorts can be
defined. When the analysis omits pregnancies without prenatal care, the estimated probability of fetal death is slightly
less than 10% (Table 6). And when these
terminations are included into the period
life table, the estimate increases to approximately 75%. The seven-fold increase
in the period life table estimate is greater
than the corresponding increase to the
pseudo-cohort and fusion estimates.
Three of the four models, the pseudocohort, the fusion, and the period life
tables, are demonstrably sensitive to the
inclusion of pregnancies without prenatal
care. In Figure 2, the cumulative probabilities for gestation months two to six
are shown for the pseudo-cohort, the fusion, and the period life tables. In each

Vol. 20, No. 4 Spontaneous
case, probability estimates with these
pregnancies included, representing 15% to
20% of all reported pregnancies, are markedly higher than estimates in which they
are excluded. This difference is the result
of a few thousand early terminations, all
fetal deaths, which when added to the
small numbers of women who seek prenatal care early, dramatically increase the
overall estimate. Late terminations without prenatal care are generally live births.
However, their impact is small since most
pregnancies are already ascertained.

Shapiro et al. (1970) reported similar
effects. Using the fusion life table, the fetal
death rate was 21.8% when fetal deaths
in the same gestation week as ascertainment were excluded and 34.0% when these
were included.

Cohort life tables, by definition, exclude
any pregnancy which is without prenatal
care. For this reason, the cohort estimates
within are not likely to be the best approximation of the true fetal death rate.
Substantial variation is seen among the
estimates based on all terminations. The
monthly probabilities converge as gestation advances (Figure 3), with the greatest variation in month two. A similar
pattern is observed when the cumulative
probabilities are plotted (Figure 2).

Three issues require further discussion.
First, why do the different models generate divergent estimates? That is, why
does the period life table estimate 75%
fetal death, the fusion life table 24%—40%
fetal death and the pseudo-cohort life table 11% fetal death? Second, why should
inclusion or exclusion of some pregnancies
drastically change a given set of estimates?
And third, what is the significance of the
unexpectedly high estimate of 75% fetal
death generated by the period life table?
These first two issues are considered in
the next section, the role of bias in life
table estimates.

Fetal Death 387
THE ROLE OF BIAS IN LIFE
TABLE ESTIMATES

That estimates of fetal death probabilities depend, in part, upon the model is
indicated by the diverse results generated
by the cohort, pseudo-cohort, fusion and
period life tables. An additional aspect
or component of such variability resides
within the data itself. Several factors,
singly or collectively, could bias the probability estimates and include: (1) the
difficulties associated with pregnancy ascertainment; (2) random and systematic
errors in the filed certificates; (3) small
sample sizes in some months relative to
samples in other months; (4) induced
abortions reported as spontaneous terminations; (5) nonreported fetal deaths;
(6) women with a higher risk of fetal
death starting their prenatal care earlier,
thus being unrepresentative of the population risk at the gestation age; (7) pregnancies which terminate in the absence of
known prenatal care (almost 20%); and
(8) the criteria used to include or exclude
a pregnancy from analysis.

PREGNANCY ASCERTAINMENT

A major obstacle in the study of fetal
death is the difficulty in detecting pregnancies in early gestation (Mall and
Meyer, 1921; Tietze, 1953). Precise estimation of fetal death probabilities ideally
requires a large cohort of pregnancies to
be determined at conception, followed prospectively until termination, and the products of conception studied when a fetal
death occurs to facilitate recognition of
etiologic factors.

Immunological slide tests, which test
urine for the presence of Human Chorionic
Gonadotropin (HCG) as an indicator of
pregnancy, are the most common sensitive
methods of early pregnancy diagnosis.4

But even these tests produce reliable results only after some fourteen days past
the missed menstrual period (MMP)
which is about forty-two days past the
LMP (Hobson, 1966; Davajan and Mishell, 1967). The MMP is usually considered the first indication of pregnancy.
That is, a woman must first suspect she’s
pregnant before presenting herself for a
pregnancy test. Recognition of the MMP
depends upon the woman’s concept of
what constitutes a “normal” cycle. First,
there is sufficient variation in human menstrual cycle length, even within women, to
allow for some unnoticed delay (Treloar
et al., 1967; Chiazze et al., 1968). Many
pregnancies would, therefore, be undiagnosed in the first two months (dated from
the LMP) and embryonic death could occur without the mother even knowing the
pregnancy existed. Second, a woman’s,interpretation of the MMP as a possible
pregnancy as opposed to a delayed period
might also depend upon her prior pregnancy experience. For example, Shapiro et
al. (1970) charted the gestation age when
pregnancy was first medically known, for
classes based on a woman’s prior pregnancy experience, and found that women
with no prior pregnancies were seen earliest and women with one or more fetal
deaths registered latest. Intermediate between these two groups were those women
who experienced only live births.

Some of the difficulties associated with
early pregnancy detection are illustrated
by Erhardt’s study in New York City
(1962, 1963) and by the Kauai pregnancy
study (Bierman et al., 1965; French and
Bierman, 1962). Erhardt used several different primary reporting sources in New
York and found that 28.5% to 40.0% of
the fetal deaths reported to him were ab
Somatommotropin) indicate tests may be developed which can detect pregnancy before the
expected menstrual period.

 

Spontaneous Fetal Death

sent from the vital records. French et al.
used seven detection procedures in their
study on Kauai, Hawaii. Still, one-third
of the fetal deaths were discovered after
the termination had already occurred, and
over half of all the pregnancies remained
undetected when the first trimester ended.
Despite intensive efforts, neither study
fully achieved its stated objective of early
pregnancy detection. Collectively, half of
the pregnancies in these two studies had
successfully completed three months of
development before ascertainment (Figure
4) (almost a third still remained to be
ascertained after an additional month)
and are, therefore, the survivors of the particular periods alleged to have the highest
risk of fetal death.

Some pregnancies are reported to have
started prenatal care prior to the missed
period. This first cohort, which contains
the only data in the current study pertaining to the first gestation period, is
used in life table computations with the
proviso that the sample may not be representative. Since pregnancies cannot be
readily verified before the second week
past the missed period, this group could
be an amorphous mixture of: (1) women
whose later visit confirmed the pregnancy
but who count an earlier visit as the start
of prenatal care; (2) erroneous dating,
where the woman perhaps confuses the
time from the LMP with the time from
the MMP; (3) errors in coding or card
punching; (4) women who actually
thought themselves to be pregnant following a coital act; and (5) women who recognize physiologic and behavioral changes
associated with minute hormonal changes
at the start of pregnancy. It is interesting
that vital records are not alone in having
prenatal care reported in the first month.
Taylor (1970) found his sample contained
“a few women who, by the records, came
for interview before missing one period.”

To compensate for problems in early
pregnancy detection, some studies have
used pregnancy histories and include early
terminations even if the woman was the
only person cognizant of the fetal death.

may be difficult to elicit from the patient.
Simons (1939), for example, studied the
pregnancy histories of 1,000 women admitted to a hospital for an abortion. He
estimated that 37.0% of their prior pregnancies ended in a fetal death although
the proportion of fetal deaths which were
recalled decreased as the number of prior
confinements (live born) increased. However, this trend could be attributed to
memory loss (Freedman et al., 1966; Potter et al., 1965) and may not be indicative of an actual decrease.

RANDOM AND SYSTEMATIC ERRORS

The advantages of the retrospective
study are often offset by faulty data. Discrepancies in the filed certificates are not
uncommon and, in some instances, data
are altogether missing. Errors could either
be random, where the chance of error is
independent of some attributes of the
data, or systematic, where the chance of
error depends, in part, upon some other
component of the record. For both cases,
we would like to know what their frequency is and how they effect probability
estimates derived in a life table.

In vital records, the magnitude of reporting errors is largely unknown. However, two hypothetical examples illustrate
how random or systematic errors could
affect probability estimates.

In the first example, suppose random
coding errors occur 5% of the time, where
the error consists of replacing a number
with either the one immediately above or
below, with equal chance. Let the actual
(as opposed to reported) numbers of ascertained pregnancies be 4,000 in gestation month two, 25,000 in month three,
and 40,000 in month four. A 5% error
implies 200, 1,250, and 2,000 pregnancies
are miscoded. The tally for month two
would have 425 additional pregnancies
(1,250/2 added from month three and 200
deducted from month two), an increase of

Fetal Death 391
over 10%. In contrast, month three loses
150 pregnancies (2,000/2 -++ 200/2 —
1,250), a drop of less than 1%.

It is easily shown that if the proportions of fetal deaths in each month are
the same, the probability estimates would
be unaffected. But the chance of fetal
death tends to decrease the longer ascertainment is delayed. If the group with the
small numbers has a higher probability, a
disproportionately larger number of live
births is misclassified from the larger adjacent group and the probability estimate
would then be too low. Conversly, a lower
probability in the small sample group
would cause the estimate to be higher than
it ought to be since a random sample from
the adjacent, large sample group contains
an excess of fetal deaths.

In the second example, suppose the
chance of incorrectly recording the month
of the first prenatal visit increases as the
time between the termination date and
that visit increases.5 Erroneous reports
would thus more likely occur in certificates reporting late terminations, most of
which are live births, than in those reporting early terminations. That is, a live
birth with prenatal care starting in the
second month might have this time reported as the third or fourth month. A
5% systematic error implies 5% of the
month-three prenatal] care group were actual visits in month two. Let the reported
numbers in each month (as opposed to
the actual numbers) be 4,000, 25,000 and
40,000 pregnancies. A 5% systematic error misclassifies 1,250 live births from
month three and 2,000 live births from
month four. The actual number in the prenatal care groups are then 5,250 in month

5 The basis for the assertion is that many hospitals rely on the woman’s recollection, after
parturition, of the month of the first visit while
in others, the physician is required to use her
personal records. Procedures for completing vital
certificates also vary according to the source of
the report.

two, 25,750 in month three and 38,000 in
month four. The probability estimate for
month two would be biased upward since
1,250 pregnancies are missing in the denominator while the estimate for month
four would be slightly lower than expected, the result of 2,000 additional pregnancies in the denominator.

While the probability of reporting the
wrong date is unknown, it might be expected to be similar to the chance of incorrectly recording the gestation age of
the termination. The length of pregnancy
is usually dated from the LMP, a date
which has traditionally been regarded as
imprecise and unreliable. Hammes and
Treloar (1970) examined this concept by
contrasting distributions of the gestation
time for term pregnancies, the data from
several vital statistics sources, with similar distributions derived from the Minnesota Menstrual Study. They conclude, “One
can be 95% confident that the bounds for
recollection for LMP dates is within plus
and minus two weeks” (p. 1504). Gestation time estimates for early fetal deaths,
however, are likely to be less accurate.
Iffy (1965) reports that “in the majority
of those gestations which eventually end
as early spontaneous abortion and ectopic pregnancy, fertilization is followed
by bleeding at the time of the expected
period” (p. 495). Many fetal deaths in
the second gestation month (dated from
the true LMP) would be unnoticed, a systematic error which would make the probability estimates too low.

UNEQUAL SAMPLE SIZES

The effect of error, either random or
systematic, is greater when there are unequal sample sizes, the smaller ones being
more sensitive. Random errors are essentially samples from other codes and an
unequal chance of selecting a live birth
(or a fetal death) biases the estimates.

Abramson

 

Social Biology

Systematic errors are functions of some
other attribute of the phenomenon measured and could involve either live births
or fetal deaths for different reasons.

INDUCED ABORTIONS REPORTED AS
SPONTANEOUS ABORTIONS

It is difficult to evaluate the bias introduced by reporting induced abortions
as spontaneous abortions. Probability estimates of spontaneous fetal death would
be inflated to the extent that induced
abortions were included in the records
(which would have been criminal prior to
July, 1970). While false reporting may
have been common, the overall pattern of
reporting in New York City from 1960
to 1970 suggests it would have been minimal (Table 7). The numbers of reported
live births and fetal deaths were about the
same until 1964, whereupon both decline.
This decline is sharpest for the early fetal
deaths, as reflected in the drop in the ratio
of early fetal death per 1,000 live births,
and counters the expectation of constant
ratio if reporting patterns did not change.
The decreased ratio observed suggests nonreporting of fetal death may have gradually increased.

In 1970, with one-half year of legalized
abortion experience, the reported number
of spontaneous fetal deaths jumped
32.2%, in the face of almost 44,000 induced abortions reported (for a_halfyear). More important, the ratio of early
fetal deaths to 1,000 live births, which
decreased steadily after 1965 (from 103.1
to 82.1), jumped to a high of 117.2%.
A sharp increase in the numbers and
proportions of early fetal death, in competition with 44,000 induced abortions
suggests that few induced abortions were
posing as spontaneous terminations in the
vital records in 1963 or 1967.8

6 Unfortunately, vital records collected since
1970 have not separated spontaneous and induced
fetal deaths. In addition, induced abortion is now

NONREPORTING OF FETAL DEATHS

Although New York City requires a
certificate to be filed for every termination, including fetal deaths in the first
twenty weeks of gestation (Erhardt, 1952;
Baumgartner and Erhardt, 1953), Erhardt
(1962, 1963) found that up to a third of
the known fetal deaths were not reported.
As a prospective study originating from
the New York City Department of Health,
the effect of study participation may itself have increased the likelihood that
some fetal deaths were reported which
might not have been otherwise. It is therefore likely that the 30% estimate represents a minimum figure. That reporting
of early fetal deaths seems to have improved since the start of the New York
abortion law (Table 7) is itself interesting.

EARLY PRENATAL CARE AS A POSSIBLE INDICATOR
OF HIGHER RISKS OF FETAL DEATH

Are pregnancies ascertained in early
gestation more often destined to terminate in an early fetal death? Women with
problems in early pregnancy, such as
bleeding, are thought to seek prenatal care
more quickly than the general population.
It is further assumed that such women
are therefore more likely to experience a
fetal death. Hudson and Rucker (1945)
report 94 spontaneous and 12 induced
abortions among 1,000 consecutive pregnancies. In addition, 66 threatened abortions (some vaginal bleeding present with
or without cramps sometime during the
pregnancy) ended in live births, though
the problems generally occurred during
the first trimester. At least 42.0% of the
women in this sample experiencing problems in early pregnancy bore live children.

a sanctioned competitor for pregnancy termination
with spontaneous fetal death and live birth.
Doubtless, some pregnancies which were spontaneous terminations before are now artificially
terminated. No reasonable predictions are yet
available of how many pregnancies should be included in this category.

Social Biology

In a later study, Rucker (1952) found
that only 14% of 141 cases of threatened
abortion during the first half of pregnancy
actually ended in a fetal death and Robinson (1967) reported that 12.3% of late
fetal deaths were preceded by bleeding
in early pregnancy. Collectively, these
studies indicate that problems during early
pregnancy are not certain indicators of
impending fetal death, though the risks
may be elevated.

Should there exist a set of high risk
pregnancies which seek prenatal care earlier than usual, the estimates would be
biased in the early periods. However, there
is no conclusive demonstration that a separate high risk population of pregnancies
exists. Warburton (1961) and Warburton
and Fraser (1964) found no support for
the concept of the habitual aborter; the
recurrence risks after abortion were the
same, Alternatively, James (1961, 1963)
asserted that women can be separated into
one of two groups based on a different
propensity to abort. Unfortunately, the
confounding effects of other variables
(e.g., maternal age, parity, socioeconomic
status) are not understood sufficiently to
decide in favor of one hypothesis or the
other. If, for example, the true probability of a fetal death within the second
gestation month is 0.50, then, independent
of the reasons prenatal care is sought, ten
women seeking prenatal care in the second month will produce five fetal deaths.
The clinical observation, moreover, remains invariant; half of the women seeking early prenatal care are having difficulties and are likely to abort. Thus, the
clinical observation, while valid, does not
itself prove that early fetal deaths are
drawn from a separate high risk population.

The characteristics of those who seek
early prenatal care in the current study
suggest no apparent difference in maternal

probabilities derived from the cohort life
table analysis were statistically evaluated.
It was found that the average private patient in New York City starts prenatal
care three months earlier than the average
clinic patient but that seeking prenatal
care earlier has no apparent effect on the
subsequent likelihood of fetal death, especially after the thirtieth week.? Similarly, neither the type of care sought nor
the type of hospital in which the woman
receives her care seems to alter the chance
of fetal death (Abramson, 1971).

PREGNANCIES WITHOUT PRENATAL CARE

The association between the likelihood
of ascertaining pregnancies and the risk of

TThe liberalized abortion law in New York,
however, has induced women to present themselves earlier in the pregnancy than they did
prior to the law. The average gestation time for
the first visit should have dropped precipitously,
as indicated by more women presenting themselves, for a specific level of live births, than
previously (see Pacter and Nelson, 1971).

Fetal Death 395
fetal death partially determines the pattern of pregnancy ascertainment. First, it
is easier to ascertain pregnancies later in
gestation. Second, the chance of fetal
death is highest in early gestation. How
these interact is illustrated as follows.
Assume 50% fetal mortality within the
second gestation month and only a 1%
chance of ascertaining a pregnancy in that
month. Then almost half (49%) of the
pregnancies are never ascertained. The
absence of these unknown terminations
sharply reduces the pool of potentially
observable pregnancies in subsequent gestation months. Therefore, ascertaining
viable pregnancies later in gestation is not
equivalent to describing early fetal deaths.
Patently, pregnancies in the former group
have zero chance of fetal death prior to
their ascertainment.

As a corollary of the above, if prenatal
care is the sole basis of entry into a study,
many fetal deaths will either occur before
care could be initiated or just at the time
care is sought. For example, in the Child
Health and Development Studies in California, ‘“‘all cases delivering within 2 days
of their first appearance have been excluded . . . to restrict the study to women
who appear for prenatal care as a matter
of natural inclination” (Taylor, 1970, p.
308). His study used 772 fetal deaths but
excluded 237 pregnancies using the above
criteria, Most of these can be presumed
to be fetal deaths. In addition, many of
731 women determined to be not pregnant
could have been early fetal deaths.

Between 15% and 20% of the pregnancy terminations were reported in the
vital records as having no known prenatal
care and, by definition, are considered to
be ascertained at the time of termination.
Pregnancies ascertained without prenatal
care were generally fetal deaths prior to
the twentieth gestation week and live
births after the thirtieth week.

396

Excluding the no-prenatal care group
from life table analysis results in lower
overall estimates of the probability of fetal
death (age-specific probabilities are lower
in the early gestation ages and higher in
later gestation, live births then being
omitted).

Since the likelihood of ascertainment is
positively associated with the gestation
age, pregnancies without prenatal care
may or may not represent a special population, which includes illegal abortions
requiring hospitalization or pregnancy terminations where the woman was not questioned about prenatal care.

CRITERIA TO INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE
PREGNANCIES

The effect of selection criteria on life
table estimates can be illustrated using
the data from the Kauai study (French
and Bierman, 1962). Ninety (30% of the
total reported fetal deaths and sixteen live
births were rejected on the grounds they
were ascertained after the pregnancy termination. Additional fetal deaths were
rejected when indicative of problems in
the reporting system, e.g., when the fact of
pregnancy itself was reported as doubtful.

Abranison

Social Biology

Two new sets of estimates for live birth
and fetal death probabilities will be derived here, one which excludes and one
which includes these 106 pregnancies
(Tables 9 and 10), illustrating changes in
life table estimates as a function of how
pregnancies are selected for inclusion in
an analysis. The period life table estimates
excluding the 106 pregnancies are approximately equal to French and Bierman’s
estimates based on a fusion model. Four
of the nine period measures exceed the
corresponding fusion measures. Three intervals in the period life table have no
fetal deaths entered and the corresponding
non-zero fusion probabilities are considered
an eStimate of the expected period probabilities.

If the ascertainment time for the 106
pregnancies is defined as their gestation
age at termination and each is included
in the analysis, the period life table estimates in months three to five are 1.6 to
1.9 times higher than previously. Linear
regression on the ratios of the two sets of
period estimates provides an estimate of
the second month probability. Now the
cumulative risk is approximately 40% in
contrast to the original estimate of 24%.

Ninety fetal deaths, which represent only
2.8% of all the pregnancies in the study,
are responsible for a 70% increase in the
cumulative probability with the larger part
of that increase coming in the first trimester. This example confirms the finding
in the current study that life tables are
sensitive to how pregnancies are scored
for inclusion in the analysis.

SUMMARY OF THE EFFECT OF BIAS

While imperfect ascertainment in several
guises leads to biased life table estimates,
the net effect of all forms of bias is
presently indeterminable. Disproportionate
sampling can result when erroneous criteria are used to include or exclude a
pregnancy from analysis. Under-reporting
or faulty classification would cause the
age-specific fetal death probabilities to be
underestimated while an increased chance
of high risk pregnancies entering the sample early would cause the monthly probabilities to be overestimated.

The net effect of bias upon the agespecific probability estimates ultimately
depends upon the degree to which the ratio
of unknown terminations to  not-yetascertained successful pregnancies (U;/
N:4.1) deviates from the ratio of observed terminations to observed survivors

(fe -+ 5:/l: + 1) (Abramson, 1971). That
is, if

 

 

b U

besa Ne41
or

the age-specific probabilities are unbiased.

Disproportionate sampling from either
the terminations or the successful pregnancies would disrupt the above equality
and result in biased probability estimates.
For example, when more fetal deaths are
reported than expected, including induced
abortions masquerading as spontaneous
abortions, the numerator in the life table
is excessive and the probability estimate
is biased upward. If successful pregnancies
are underreported at a specific gestation
age, the corresponding denominator decreases and the probability estimate is
again biased upward. In most cases, the
bias in the probability estimates can be
expressed in terms which are independent
of the actual sample size used to generate
the estimates (Abramson, 1971).

DISCUSSION
The four life table analyses performed
on the vital records from New York City
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

398 Abramson

demonstrate a functional relationship between the analytic model and the resulting
fetal death estimates. In addition, the
diversification of fetal death estimates,
including those from previous studies,
suggests that the question of the extent
of fetal death is not yet resolved. The life
table format for analysis was selected because it seemed to provide both the greatest flexibility and greatest utilization of
the information about pregnancy. Recognition that more than one type of life table
can be used to analyze pregnancy data
indicated the necessity first to define each
model and then to derive estimates using
a single source of data.

Evaluation of fetal death estimates is,
to a large extent, based on the specific
characteristics associated with the model
selected. Each type of life table possesses
positive and negative attributes which limit
the type of inferences which can be made.
Cohort life tables summarize the actual
experience of some initial group and provide a basis for comparison among defined
subgroups. However, there is no provision
to include pregnancies which cannot be
assigned to a specific cohort (for example,
pregnancies without prenatal care cannot
be used in cohorts formed on the basis of
when prenatal care began).

In addition, most cohorts start their
experience later in gestation than one would
desire. Only one-third of the pregnancies
used in this study could be used for first
trimester cohorts in either 1963 or 1967.
Given that fetal death risks fall rapidly
as gestation advances and that pregnancy
detection simultaneously becomes easier,
determining a sufficiently large cohort close
to the start of pregnancy presents obvious
problems, Pseudo-cohorts include all pregnancies in the analysis, regardless of when
or how they were first observed. Since
pregnancies are not really at risk to termination (in the life table) prior to their

Social Biology

ascertainment, the pseudo-cohort underestimates age-specific probabilities. The
11% fetal death estimate, therefore, might
be considered a minimum.

Fusion life tables are also capable of
utilizing every pregnancy. If prenatal care
before termination is universal, then it
remains only to show that each cohort’s
risks are approximately the same. While
the prenatal care cohorts within have approximately the same age-specific risks in
both 1963 and 1967 (Table 5), almost
20% of the pregnancies have no reported
prenatal care. Most of these are fetal
deaths. When these pregnancies are included, the mortality estimates approach
40%, which exceeds the findings of Erhardt
(1962, 1963) and French and Bierman
(1962).

Finally, the period life table estimates
for both 1963 and 1967 were approximately 75%. Although this model had the
advantage of using a cross-section of information, it also is affected, in varying
degrees, by biases in the data, especially
in the earlier gestation periods.

Unfortunately, the magnitude of most
of these biases is indeterminable at present. The explanation of the difference
between the period life table estimates
and the fusion life table estimates is to
a large extent attributed to the length of
time pregnancies are carried in each life
table. Table 11 presents the numbers of
pregnancies used in the period and fusion
life tables. The numbers for the denominator differ for the two models while
the numerators are essentially the same.
Differences in the denominators are explainable in that the fusion life table
continues pregnancies into successive gestation ages. In addition, pregnancies observed later in gestation have an increased
chance of ending in a live birth.

The differences between the two models
are most striking when the distributions of

The unexpected finding that fetal mortality may be as high as 75% has ramifications in several areas. An immediate
implication is that the extent of pregnancy
itself (more precisely, the extent of fertilization and implantation) would be
trebled. Under 25% mortality, 1.3 pregnancies are required per live birth while

if mortality approached 75%, 4.0 pregnancies are required. To express these
figures in terms of the numbers of fetal
deaths, 75% fetal mortality would result
in ten-fold more fetal deaths than would
25% mortality (3.0 versus 0.3).

Vol. 20, No. 4 Spontaneous
fetal deaths are associated with chromosomal abnormalities, and that the frequency
or proportion of these abnormalities increases in younger embryos (Carr [1971]
has reviewed this area). In addition, specific teratogenic agents have been identified, such as rubella and thalidomide, whose
mode and time of action have been defined.

High fetal mortality may therefore
indicate the extent of deformity associated
with the reproductive or developmental
process. Furthermore, the indication that
almost 90% of the loss occurs during the
first trimester suggests that many embryos
already possess a major defect which may
be of genetic, chromosomal, or environmental origin. Determination of the early
effects of teratogenic agents may be difficult, partially the result of an already
significant chance of death resulting from
other factors.

Separating high fetal mortality from low
conceptability would be difficult since early
fetal death more closely resembles inconceptability than it does late fetal death.
Therefore, demographic estimates would
not be strongly affected by high fetal
mortality. The upper estimate of 75% is
theoretically possible, at least when considering the average birth intervals observed
in several noncontracepting populations
(Abramson, 1973).

The diagnosis of infertility in patients
might now be separable into two components: (1) those where fertilization is
absent; (2) those where fertilization and
implantation occurs but where the pregnancy does not survive. Assignment to
either of these classes could be made based
on the results of early pregnancy testing.

Finally, although no satisfactory estimates are available for heterogeneous or
mixed populations, the life table model is
the appropriate choice to assess the risk
of fetal death in defined, homogeneous
populations. Not every woman has an

 

Fetal Death 401
equal chance of fetal death (James, 1963).
Age, parity, nutritional status, and other
parameters including specific genes, likely
represent specific effects which determine
a woman’s risk. For example, Shapiro et al.
(1970) and Erhardt (1963) found the
risks to differ when their populations were
subdivided based on maternal age or the
number of live births. For other populations, for example, those which may be
characterized by genetic factors such as
schizophrenia, Huntington’s Chorea, RH
incompatibility, or diabetes, a_ specific
genotype may alter the chance of fetal
death, either increasing or decreasing it.
Application of uniform analytic procedures
tailored to the specific experimental situations would facilitate precise estimates and
comparisons among such populations.

SUMMARY

Four life table models, the cohort, the
pseudo-cohort, the fusion, and the period
life tables, have been described with respect to their use as estimators of the
extent of fetal death in man. Evaluation
of these models was based upon the vital
records from New York City, collected in
1963 and 1967, which contain 165,000 live
births and 21,000 fetal deaths and 142,000
live births and 18,000 fetal deaths respectively.

From 15% to 20% of the pregnancy
termination reported in the vital records
were without prenatal care. Each life table
model was tested in two ways: (1) using
only pregnancies with prenatal care and
(2) using all reported pregnancies, Estimates using the first condition range from
2% to 13% fetal death (from the start of
the missed menstrual period). When pregnancies without prenatal care were included in each life table, the new estimates
were three to twenty times higher (11%
to 75%).

Although the decision to include or
exclude pregnancies ascertained at terDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

402

mination causes a large change in the life
table estimates, other factors which also
influence the estimates include: (1) the
difficulties associated with pregnancy ascertainment; (2) random and systematic
errors in the records; (3) small samples in
some months relative to other months; (4)
induced abortions reported as spontaneous
terminations; (5) nonreported fetal deaths;
(6) high risk pregnancies coming under
medical care earlier than expected;
(7) pregnancies which terminate in the
absence of prenatal care (or prior ascertainment); and (8) the criteria to include
or exclude pregnancies from analysis.
These all operate, singly or in combination,
to distort the final estimate. The extent
to which the sample of pregnancies used
in analysis deviates from being representative of all pregnancies determines the bias
in the final estimate. However, if the net
effect of the bias is determined, the probability estimate can be adjusted.

Abramson

Social Biology

The extent of fetal death in man is
likely to be between the 25% derived from
the most conservative form of the fusion
life table and the 75% derived from the
period life table. Both the pseudo-cohort
and the cohort life table tend to underestimate the chance of fetal death unless
a cohort could be formed at about the
missed menstrual period. Resolution of
whether human populations indeed experience 75% fetal death awaits precise
investigation of pregnancy risks during
the first trimester.
