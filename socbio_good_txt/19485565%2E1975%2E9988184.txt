Book Notes

CoMPUTER SIMULATION IN HUMAN PoPULATION Stupres: Edited by Bennett
Dyke and Jean Walters MacCluer. Academic Press, New York, 1974. 518 pp.
$16.00 (hardbound).

This comprehensive report contains
twenty-four original articles presented at
a Conference on the Uses of Computer
Simulation in Human Population Studies
held at The Pennsylvania State University
in 1972. The strong interdisciplinary character of the book is reflected by the four
major divisions: “Anthropology and Social
Systems”; “Genetics and Adaptive Systems”; “Demography”; and “Simulation
Methodology.” These papers should appeal
to a wide audience, including investigators
in biological anthropology, human genetics,
demography, and social anthropology.

THE CHANGING SEX DIFFERENTIAL IN
MortArity: By Robert D. Retherford.
Greenwood Press, Westport, Connecticut,
1975. 139 pp. $11.00 (hardbound).

A rapid improvement in general life span
has occurred during the twentieth century
in the Western world. Women have benefited to a greater extent than men, In 1965,
the average expectation of life at birth in
the United States was about 67 years for
males and 74 years for females, representing an increase of about 38 per cent for
males and 41 per cent for females over the
figures for the 1910’s. The sex mortality
differential widened by nearly 95 per cent

 

 

during the same period, in favor of females.
This book was written to explore the causes
of this abrupt change, and Retherford suggests a number of social factors that may
be responsible in part for changes in the
sex differential in mortality.

CONTRACEPTION AND FERTILITY CHANGE
IN THE INTERNATIONAL POSTPARTUM
ProcRAm: By Irving Sivin. The Population Council, New York, 1974. 98 pp.
$3.95 (paperbound).

In 1966, the Population Council initiated
the International Postpartum Program. By
January, 1973, one million women in 21
countries: had accepted family planning
methods at participating clinics, and the
program has become one of the most extensive family planning programs in the world.
This book focuses on the role of modern
contraceptives in reducing fertility through
a postpartum program, Acceptance and continuation patterns, pregnancy and fertility
rates, and a statistical analysis of the fertility decline are described and further clarified by the use of four figures and nearly
a hundred tables.

SUICIDE AND ATTEMPTED SuiciDE: Edited
by Eileen M. Brooke. World Health Organization Public Health Papers No. 58,
Geneva, 1974. 127 pp. Sw. fr. 8.— (paperbound).

In Part I of this book, E. M. Brooke and
M. Atkinson review the problem of ascer

tainment of deaths from suicide on the basis
of two WHO studies proposed by N. Kessel.
One of these studies revealed that variations
in response among those deciding whether
a death is due to suicide may have an effect
on the suicide rate. Thus, it is suggested
that a standard definition of suicide should
be forthcoming. In Part II is a report of
the deliberations of a working group on
suicide and attempted suicide in young
people. A number of recommendations are
proposed for a framework for future research into rates of suicide and attempted
suicide.

GENEALOGICAL MATHEMATICS: Edited by
Paul A. Ballonoff. Mouton, Paris, 1974.
311 pp. $15.00 (paperbound).

These sixteen original papers are the
proceedings of the Mathematical Social
Sciences Board Conference on Genealogical
Mathematics held at the University of
Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston
from February 28 to March 3, 1974. Comprised of social scientists, population geneticists, demographers, and mathematicians,
the conference was designed to explore new
mathematical developments in the general
area of social organization. The book is divided into three primary sections: algebraic
approaches, statistical approaches, and genetic approaches. In each section are articles on analysis of kinship systems, marriage networks, demographic transition, and
other topics of special interest to geneticists
and anthropologists.

GENETICS AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE: MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURALISM IN POPULATION GENETICS AND SocraL THEORY:
Edited by Paul Ballonoff. Dowden,
Hutchinson, and Ross, Stroudsburg, Pa.,
1974, 504 pp. $22.00 (hardbound).

Included in this volume are twenty-one
papers that delineate the mathematical and

 

Social Biology

structural foundations of population genetics and social theory. All papers have
been previously published with the exception of Cotterman’s “A Calculus for Statistico-Genetics” and range in date from
MacFarlane’s paper on consanguinity and
affinity (1882) to several in the late 1960's
and early 1970’s. The papers are intended
to highlight a century of anthropological
and sociological attempts to describe kinbased systems of social relatedness and the
reviving tradition of structuralism in population genetics. The volume will be of
special importance to anthropologists, geneticists, and sociologists.

Human GENETICS (Vol. I): Edited by
N. P. Bochkov. G. K. Hall, Boston, 1974.
120 pp. $22.00 (hardbound).

Four articles translated from Russian to
English provide surveys of progress in the
Soviet Union in the study of: gene coupling
and human chromosomal mapping, with
charts for autosome 1 and X-chromosome;
methodological approaches to identification
of chromosomes; achievements of modern
biochemistry in the investigation of hereditary metabolic defects at the cellular level;
principles of diagnosing hereditary enzymopathy in cell cultures; and data on biochemical changes pertaining to the activity
in cells with an aberrant karyotype.

GLOSSARY OF MENTAL DISORDERS AND
GuIDE TO THEIR CLASSIFICATION FOR
USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE JNTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES:
(8th revision): World Health Organization, Geneva, 1974. 86 pp. Sw. fr. 12.(paperbound).

WHO has published this glossary as part
of the program aimed at improving the
standardization of diagnosis, classification,
and statistics in psychiatry. It is intended

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

Vol. 22, No. 3

to provide guidance to psychiatrists in selecting the diagnostic code most descriptive
of the clinical characteristics of the patient.
The glossary consists of internationally
agreed-upon descriptions of a number of
diagnostic categories. Many of these categories are followed by a list of synonyms
and frequently used names for conditions
falling into that category. The categories
are assembled alphabetically in an index
for quick and easy reference.

WHO Expert CoMMITTEE oN Druc DEPENDENCE. TWENTIETH REPORT: World
Health Organization Technical Report
Series No. 551. World Health Organization, Geneva, 1974. 89 pp. Sw. fr. 7.(paperbound).

This report reviews the factors known or
presumed to be associated with initial, experimental, casual, and dependent drug use,
as well as with the cessation of drug use.
It discusses some general points that need
to be considered in the planning of activities for the prevention and reduction of
drug-related problems. The broad goal of
problem prevention is broken down into a
series of more limited specific objectives
that relate to the planning and implementation of preventive measures.

Kinsurp IN Bari: By Hildred Geertz and
Clifford Geertz. University of Chicago
Press, Chicago, 1975. 213 pp. $12.50
(hardbound).

This book is an examination of Balinese
kinship and a theoretical analysis of the
central ethnographic concept of “kinship
system.” The authors question the prevailing anthropological concept that kinship
systems are autonomous sets of institutionalized social relationships. They suggest
that kinship should be viewed as a symbolic

subsystem governed by ideas and beliefs
unique to each culture. In their analysis of
Balinese kinship, an alternative to the currently accepted notion of kinship system is
presented.

GENETIC DisTaNcE: Compiled by James F.
Crow and Carter Denniston. Plenum
Publishing Corporation, New York, 1974.
195 pp. $19.50 (hardbound).

The thirteen papers represent the proceedings of a workshop on genetic distance
included in the program of the Fourth International Congress of Human Genetics
held in Paris in 1971. These reports, for
the most part, are methodological rather
than theoretical. The relative merits of different techniques are explored, and topics
such as indicators of genetic distance, distance measures for phylogenetic trees, and
the effects of migration on some distance
measures are included.

CoMPLEX ADAPTATIONS IN EVOLVING PopPULATIONS: By T. H. Frazzetta. Sinauver
Associates, Inc., Sunderland, Mass., 1975.
267 pp. $4.95 (paperbound).

This book begins with examples of complex adaptations and the major ideas of the
modern Neo-Darwinian theory. Subsequent
chapters examine the effects of selection,
changes in adaptation, the probable fate of
rare mutants, and the evolution of adaptations. Frazzetta also discusses the fossil
record, the evolution of developmental processes, and their effects on adaptive flexibility. Written clearly and without jargon,
the book is intended for a broad audience.
The interdisciplinary approach is advocated, and it is stressed that many evolutionary concepts are satisfactory in one
discipline but implausible in another.

These papers are the proceedings of the
International Workshops on Correlates of
Sub-fertility and Infertility in Africa, held
at Ibadan, Nigeria, on November 26-30,
1973. In four short chapters, a review is
presented of the occurrence of fertility
problems, the factors influencing them, and
ways of conducting surveys to further investigate these conditions. Three appendices
contain short reports on the economic,
sociocultural, psychological, and medical
factors that relate to sub-fertility and infertility, Thirteen pages of bibliography
are included.

Lecture Notes IN BIoMATHEMATICS 3.
Stocwastic PopuLATION THEORIES: By
Donald Ludwig. Springer-Verlag, New
York, 1974. 108 pp. $7.40 (paperbound).

Ludwig’s notes for an introduction to
stochastic theories relevant to population
biology are based on a course given in the
spring of 1974. The notes assume an ac

quaintance with probability theory and
differential equations. More advanced
topics, including the qualitative behavior
of nonlinear models, are preceded by a
succession of simpler problems. Intuitive
interpretations are emphasized over formal
proofs, although simple and useful models
are treated in some detail.

GENETICS OF FLowERING PLants: By
Verne Grant. Columbia University Press,
New York, 1975. 514 pp. $20.00 (hardbound).

In this summary of our knowledge and
understanding of the genetics of higher
plants, Grant emphasizes the nature and
action of genes, gene systems, linkage systems, and genetic systems in higher plants.
Among many other topics are chapters on
sex determination, mosaicism, aberrant segregation ratios, multifactorial linkage, translocation heterozygotes, and recombination
systems. With the clarity of style typical
of his other works, Grant relates the evidence of plant genetics to the findings and
concepts of other branches of genetics. This
book is particularly appropriate for investigators and students in genetics, botany, and
agriculture.
