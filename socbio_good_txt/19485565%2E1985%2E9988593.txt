Sibling and Environmental Correlates of
Adolescents’ Perceptions of Family Environments:

Ethnic Group Differences

ABSTRACT: Hierarchical regression analyses and response surfaces were used in an investigation of relationships between sibling variables and adolescents’ perceptions of their family environments, after the tmpact on the perceptions of earlier family measures was taken into account. The analyses involved Australian adolescents and included 260 Anglo-Australian, 120
Greek, and 90 Southern Italian families. Regression models included terms to test for possible
linear, interaction, and curvilinear associations between the sibling and family environment
variables. The analysis suggested the propositions that: (a) parents from different ethnic groups
create different learning environments for their children and that there are ethnic-group variations in how children perceive their family environments, (b) there are ethnic-group variations
in relationships between sibling variables and adolescents’ perceptions of their parents’ support
for learning, and (c) within ethnic groups the relationships between sibling variables and perceived parental support for learning differ, depending on whether the support of fathers or

mothers is being considered.

One of the most significant models
that has been used to examine relationships between sibling variables and intellectual growth is the confluence
model developed by Zajonc and
Markus (1975). It is proposed that, in
any given period, intellectual growth is
related to the intellectual quality of family environments where quality is determined by influences such as the number
of siblings in families, the age spacing
between siblings, and whether individuals are only or last children in families
(see, Zajonc, 1976; Markus and Zajonc,
1977; Zajonc et al., 1979; Zajonc and
Bargh, 1980).

Although Zajonc (1983, p. 458) suggests that ‘“‘the central concept of the
confluence model is the intellectual environment within the family,” there have
been few studies which have investigated relationships between sibling vari
71

ables and family learning environments.
It is claimed by Svanum and Bringle
(1980, p. 435) that while the family environment construct has been welldefined mathematically in the confluence model “‘it is vague and nebulous
in its psychosocial nature.” They ask,
‘‘What is the nature of such an average
environment, how is it conveyed, what
sort of measures would quantify it?” (see
also Brackbill and Nichols, 1982;
Galbraith, 1982a, 19825). An attempt is
made in this present study to further our
understanding of the relationships between sibling variables and family environments by examining associations between sib size, birth order, and the
family learning environments of a sample of Australian adolescents.

Many studies that have adopted the
‘‘Wisconsin”’ social-psychological
model of status attainment have shown

that adolescents’ perceptions of family
environments have an important influence on their eventual educational attainment (e.g., Gottfredson, 1981;
Hauser et al., 1983; Jencks et al., 1983;
Campbell, 1983). It was decided, therefore, that in this analysis the learning environments of families would be assessed by the adolescents’ perceptions
of the support for learning they had received from their parents. Relationships
between sibling variables and adolescents’ perceptions of family environments may, however, merely represent
associations between surrogate environment variables and the perception measures. Research that has investigated relations between sibling variables and
cognitive performance, for example,
has often indicated that the size of such
associations is reduced when social context measures are included in the analyses (e.g., Record et ai., 1969; Marjoribanks et al., 1975; Kunz and Peterson,
1977; Valendia et al., 1978). In this
study, therefore, relationships between
the sibling and perceived environment
variables were examined after taking
into account the impact on the perception measures of family social status and
family environment measures that were
assessed when the adolescents were five
years younger.

In an alternative explanation of sibling influences on cognitive performance, Page and Grandon (1979) have
proposed that the significant associations found in many studies may merely
be an artifact of the pooling of subpopulations (see also Melican and Feldt,
1980; Valencia et al., 1981). They have
suggested that investigations of sibling
correlates of individuals’ attributes
should be conducted within different social groups. As a further refinement to
this study, the relations between the sib

ling and environment measures were examined in different ethnic groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In 1977 the family learning environments of approximately one thousand
11-year-old Australian children were assessed in an analysis of the environmental correlates of their academic achievement (Marjoribanks, 1979, 1980).
During 1982 resources permitted the
longitudinal study of half the earlier
sample. For the latter investigation two
parallel pools of families from the original study were formed. The purpose of

the substitute pool was to provide a set

of alternate families that could be used if
families from the first pool could not
participate. For this study the sample included 260 Anglo-Australian, 120
Greek, and 90 Southern Italian families.
In the Greek and Southern Italian families both parents had migrated to Australia, and they indicated that Greek or
Italian was the language typically spoken in their respective homes. Families
were classified as Anglo-Australian if
both parents were born in either Australia or England and English was the only
language spoken in the home. Each of
the families in the second survey had a
16-year-old child, and the analyses related to those adolescents. Findings
from the investigation need to be interpreted within the limitation that the
sample was not random. Throughout
the analyses, however, adjustments
were made for the design effects of the
sample. Significance levels of all statistics were adjusted using the formula:
standard error of sample estimate =
(design effect)’* X simple random sample standard error (Kish and Frankel,
1974; Ross, 1978).

ENVIRONMENT MEASURES

During the initial survey, family
learning environments were defined by
three dimensions that were labeled parents’ aspirations for their children and
parents’ instrumental and affective orientations toward learning. Parents’ aspirations were assessed by the educational and occupational aspirations that
parents expressed for their children. Instrumental orientations were defined by
an equally weighted composite of parents’ achievement orientations for their
children, parents’ concern for English
within the family, and their involvement
in reading. Affective orientations were
gauged by the sum of the parents’ concern for independence and their
individualistic-collectivistic achievement-value orientations (see, Marjoribanks, 1981).

A family environment scale, in the
form of a semi-structured home interview schedule, was used to obtain responses from parents. Interviewing in
homes was conducted by experienced
social-survey interviewers. Scores on
the items making up each of the environment dimensions were factor analyzed, using principal component analyses, to generate factor scales. The initial
family learning environment was measured, therefore, by factor scales that assessed parents’ aspirations, and instrumental and affective orientations. In the
initial interviews social status data were
also collected, and family social status
scores were constructed from equally
weighted composites of the occupations
and education of parents. Information
was also obtained from parents about
the number of children in their families
and the birth-order positions of those
children.

In the follow-up study, five years

Family Environments 73

later, a structured questionnaire was
used to gather information about the adolescents’ perceptions of their parents’
educational and occupational aspirations for them, the encouragement they
received from their parents, and their
parents’ general interest in their education. From the responses two scales
were constructed and they were labeled
as adolescents’ perceptions of their father support and mother support for
learning. Each of the environmental dimensions used in the study had a theta
reliability estimate greater than 0.75.

RESULTS

Because of the relatively limited sample sizes in the Greek and Southern Italian groups the data were not examined
separately for females and males, which
is a further restriction of the study. The
shapes of the profiles of mean family environment scores for each ethnic group
as shown in Figure 1. Scores for the
figure (and for later figures) were standardized with means of 50 and standard
deviations of 10, calculated over the total sample. The profiles indicated that
Anglo-Australian families were characterized by parents who expressed relatively modest aspirations for their children and had strong instrumental
orientations and _ independentindividualistic affective orientations. In
contrast, the Greek and Southern Italian
parents indicated higher aspirations for
their children, weaker instrumental orientations, and dependent-collectivistic
affective orientations. Greek adolescents perceived their parents as providing supportive learning environments
while the Anglo-Australian and Southern Italian adolescents had perceptions
of relatively weaker parental support for
learning. When the three ethnic groups

were included in regression models as

associations with parents’ aspirations
and instrumental and affective orientations of 0.338, 0.755, and 0.719, respectively. For the adolescents’ perceptions
of father and mother support for learning, the relations to ethnicity were 0.283
and 0.271, respectively. That is, these
initial findings indicated moderate to
large ethnic-group differences in the

 

family learning environment dimensions.

The first investigation of the relationships between the sibling and environment variables involved an analysis of
zero-order correlations. In Table 1 the
results indicated that in each ethnic
group the adolescents’ perceptions of
their parents’ support for learning had
moderate associations with family social
status and parents’ aspirations. The pery [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

ception measures were related, however, only to the instrumental orientations of the Anglo-Australian parents
and to the affective orientations in the
Southern Italian group. Sib size and
birth order had modest relations to the
Greek adolescents’ perceptions of both
father and mother support for learning,
and they were associated with the
father-support scores for the AngloAustralian adolescents. Although these
results indicated that the sibling variables had either negligible or modest relationships to the perceived environment measures, they did suggest
ethnic-group variations in the nature of
the associations.

Relations between the variables,
within each ethnic group were investigated further by plotting regression surfaces that were generated from twostage hierarchical regression models. In
the hierarchical models, product terms
were included to test for possible interaction effects among the variables while
squared terms were added to examine
for possible curvilinear relationships.

presence of interaction and curvilinear
associations between sibling measures
and individuals’ attributes (e.g., Rankin
et al., 1979; Knight, 1982; Zajonc,
1983). The regression models were of
the form: Z = aX + bY + cX*Y + dX’
+ eY* + constant, where Z, X and Y
represented measures of the adolescents’ perceptions of their parents’ support, earlier family environment variables, and the sibling variables,
respectively. In the analyses, interaction
and squared terms that were not related
to the perception measures were deleted
from the regression models and associations with the remaining predictor variables were reexamined.

The results in Table 2 indicated that
after accounting for the influence of
family social status and parents’ instrumental orientations, sib size made a
significant contribution to the variation
in the perceived father-support scores of
Anglo-Australian adolescents and to
the mother-support scores of Greek adolescents. When affective orientations
were included in the regression models,
sib size was related to both perception

there were no relations between birth

The three surfaces that have been
presented in Figure 3 indicate the nature
of the various significant relationships
involving birth order. They show the

order and the perceived mother support

DISCUSSION

The analysis suggests the general
propositions that (a) parents from different ethnic groups create different

learning environments for their children
and that there are ethnic-group variations in how children perceive their family environments, (b) there are ethnicgroup variations in relationships
between sibling variables and adolescents’ perceptions of their parents’ support for learning, and (c) within ethnic
groups the relationships between sibling
variables and perceived parental sup

port for learning differ, depending on
whether the support of fathers or mothers is being considered.

Also, by finding that the sibling variables continued to have some associations with the perceived environment
measures, even after controlling for the
impact of earlier environment variables,
the study suggests the need for further
investigations of the relationships between sibling variables and learning environments. In such investigations measures are required that examine with
greater sensitivity the nature and quality
of parent-child interactions in families
from different social groups. Such analyses may indicate, for example, why the
sibling variables were not related to the
Southern Italian adolescents’ percep

tions of their parents’ support for learning or why father support was more sensitive to sibling variables than perceived
mother support for the AngloAustralian adolescents. Also, other sibling variables should be considered such
as the age spacing between siblings, the
gender and age of children, and whether
the children are only, first-born, or lastborn. Only when such refinements are
included will there be a more complete
understanding of the nature of the rela
‘tionships between sibling variables and

the learning environments of families.
Until such an understanding is achieved
it is unlikely that our knowledge of how
sibling variables eventually influence
characteristics such as intellectual functioning will be enhanced.
