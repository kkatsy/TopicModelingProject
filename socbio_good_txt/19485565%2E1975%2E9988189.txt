Fishing and Fertility: A Study of a

Nova Scotia Fishing Village

Ishmael O. Okraku

Department of Sociology
St. Mary’s University
Halifax, Nova Scotia

Research interest in Nova Scotia’s small
fishing villages has focused primarily on
their relative isolation and the socioeconomic impact of their single nonprosperous
industry. Reported studies include analyses
of personal incomes and life-styles of fishermen (Pepin, 1968) and of modernization
of the fishing industry and its impact on a
community (MacDonald and Clare, 1967;
Proskie, 1961). Some of these studies examine population variables, but mainly as
background factors in a nondemographic
analysis. Detailed analyses of demographic
processes in the villages are rare. Particularly, fertility and its possible links with a
fishing economy remains relatively unexplored. This research focuses specifically
on this issue. It examines the effects of
different types of fishing employment on
reproductive behavior.

The results suggest that fishing may exert a real influence on fertility. However,
because the study was based on limited
samples drawn from a single fishing village,
further investigation is necessary to substantiate our tentative findings. Conditions
in the fishing communities offer an unusual
opportunity for studying relationships between occupation and reproductive behavior. Apart from variations in specific jobs

 

done in the fishing industry, residents of
individual fishing villages generally show
a high degree of homogeneity with respect
to level of education, income, religious
affiliation, race, and ethnic background,
thereby permitting an analysis of fishing
and childbearing under conditions in
which these important fertility-related variables are relatively controlled. We hope
that this research is the beginning of increased interest in fertility and other forms
of demographic behavior in the fishing
villages.

The particular aspect of fishing which
prompted this study is the fact that fishermen have to spend considerable lengths
of time away from their wives on fishing
trips. Because of these frequent trips, fishermen should have lower rates of coitus
and, hence, lower fertility than other workers with similar socioeconomic characteristics who work regular hours and thus spend
more time at home with their wives. To investigate this hypothesis, a sample of fishermen was compared with a sample of
plant workers, who do not go to sea but
work regular hours as fish cutters and
packers in fish factories. Within the fishing
sample two types of fishermen were distinguished, based on length of fishing trips:

326

Vol. 22, No. 4 .

deep-sea fishermen, who make the longest
trips and are away from home as long as
twenty-one days at times, with short rest
periods between trips; and in-shore fishermen, who make daily trips and therefore
come home every day. Unlike plant workers, the latter work very long and irregular
hours and are away at sea most nights.

The three groups of workers were compared on three aspects of fertility behavior:
number of children born per family, interval between successive births, and interval
since last birth. In line with our general
assumption that frequent sea trips would
tend to depress fertility, we expected:
(1) Deep-sea fishermen would have the
fewest children, the longest intervals between successive births, and the longest
interval since the last birth. (2) Plant
workers would differ the most from the
deep-sea fishermen, with the largest family
sizes and the shortest birth intervals.
(3) In-shore fishermen would occupy an
intermediate position, but one closer to the
plant workers than to the deep-sea fishermen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The study was conducted in a fishing
village located on the south shores of Nova
Scotia, about 130 miles from Halifax. Apart
from proximity to Halifax, the research
base, three other factors favored the selection of this particular village. First, fishing,
particularly the deep-sea variety, was done
all-year-round, and not on a seasonal basis.
Second, both deep-sea and in-shore fishing
were done extensively. Third, three local
fishing companies employed most of the
village’s estimated twelve hundred residents as either fishermen or plant workers.
The study sample was drawn from the
companies’ lists of their own employees
and of independent fishermen in the village.
Recent lists of registered voters also were
carefully checked for additional respon

dents. The voter lists had been compiled
for the 1968 federal general elections and
indicated current occupation for each voter
listed. With the assistance of informers,
each married and currently mated fisherman on these lists was identified and included in the sample. In all, 143 fishermen
(93 deep-sea and 50 in-shore), 39 plant
workers, and 19 other workers were contacted for a total study sample of 201
families.

Three interviewers conducted extensive
interviews with the wives of these men
over an eight-week period in the summer
of 1968. A major item of information collected was complete birth histories, from
which the measures of fertility (mean live
births per couple) and timing of childbearing (mean interval between successive
births and interval since last birth) used
in the analysis were computed. Data were
also collected on desired and ideal family
size.

Husband’s occupation, our major independent variable, was measured in terms
of occupation at the time of the survey as
well as occupation during marriage. The
second measure was developed from data
on work histories and used primarily to
separate husbands who had done the same
job throughout marriage from those who
had changed jobs, in an effort to control
the possible effects of this factor in the
analysis. We had anticipated considerable
mobility between deep-sea and in-shore
fishing. For example, a deep-sea fisherman
could change to in-shore fishing, which is
less physically demanding, as he advanced
in age. Similarly, an in-shore fisherman experiencing poor financial returns might decide to join a deep-sea fishing crew.

The work histories of our respondents
seem to confirm our suspicions. Of the 93
husbands described as deep-sea fishermen
at the time of the survey, only 61.3 per
cent had done the same job throughout

marriage. The figure for in-shore fishermen
was 60 per cent. In view of this finding,
particular attention is given in the analysis
to families in which the husband had done
the same type of fishing since marriage,
with the expectation that if fishing has an
effect on childbearing it would be most
evident among them.

annual incomes of their husbands were
generally low. Their incomes in 1967 were
on the average about 12 per cent less than
the incomes of all male workers in Nova
Scotia in the same year (see Canada Year
Book, 1969).

However, both age and income vary with
husband’s occupation. As in previous studies (e.g., MacDonald and Clare, 1967),
deep-sea fishermen are much younger and
have higher incomes than in-shore fisher

typical picture of socioeconomic conditions
in Nova Scotia fishing villages: a relatively
old population due to out-migration of the
youth and low levels of education and income (see Pepin, 1968). Over 73 per cent
of the women interviewed reported ages of
30 years or higher, with a mean of 40.8 for
the total sample. Nearly 40 per cent of
them had no more than elementary-school
education. A few had gone beyond high

men. The age difference may be due in
part to the fact that deep-sea fishing is a
more recent development in Nova Scotia.
In addition, it is a large-scale industrial
operation, organized usually by fishing
companies, and utilizes the most modern
fishing technology. The fishermen rely on
large powerful boats to penetrate deep into
the ocean on fishing trips, thus widening
the range of fish available to them and

ensuring large landings and relatively high
personal incomes.

In-shore fishing, on the other hand, relies on old traditional methods and tends
to be an independent and private operation
undertaken by individual families. The
general image of the average in-shore fisherman in Nova Scotia is that of a proud
individual who has developed his own fishing technique over the years and steadfastly adheres to it, even though changes
in the industry have made it unprofitable
(Pepin, 1968; Proskie, 1961). Forty-six
out of the fifty in-shore fishermen in our
sample were self-employed and fished in
their own boats. Most of them (82 per
cent) used small open boats compared with
the larger draggers and long liners used by
the deep-sea fishermen. Because of their
inability to go farther into the ocean, the
landings of in-shore fishermen tend to be
small and limited to fish of little commercial value, thus accounting for their low
personal incomes.

The plant workers in our sample are
younger and have lower personal incomes
on the average than either the deep-sea or
in-shore fishermen, and their wives have
less education than those of the fishermen.
As noted above, most plant workers are
unskilled laborers working at a variety of
jobs in fish factories. Their work week is
often longer than the usual forty hours,
with very low hourly wages (Pepin, 1968).

While the above age and income differences between deep-sea fishermen, in-shore
fishermen, and plant workers are noteworthy, they should not blind us to the
fact that the three groups are very similar
in many ways. They all rely on fishing for
their living, are rural residents, and are very
low in socioeconomic status. In the particular village chosen for this study, they also
all happened to be native-born, white,
English-speaking, and Protestant. What
this study seeks to do, then, is to portray

variations in fertility behavior in a sample
which is relatively homogeneous in terms
of numerous fertility-related factors.

RESULTS

Because of the small number of fishing
and plant-worker families involved in the
study, many of our statistical computations
were derived from limited sample bases.
However, in spite of this limitation, our
analyses revealed some clear and stable
patterns.

NUMBER OF CHILDREN BORN

Table 2 presents data on number of
children born by two measures of husband’s

occupation: occupation at the time of the
survey and occupation during marriage. As
indicated earlier, the latter measure eliminates from analysis women whose husbands
had changed jobs during marriage. Due to
small sample sizes, only two broad age
categories of women are used in the analysis—women in the reproductive ages of
15-44 and those 45 years and over.

As expected, the data show that on the
average fishing wives have fewer children

than plant-worker wives; and that within
the group deep-sea wivés have considerably
fewer children than in-shore wives. When
the analysis is limited to respondents whose
husbands had held the same job throughout
marriage (lower half of Table 2), the mean
live births of deep-sea wives drop sharply,
accompanied by moderate changes in the
rates of in-shore and plant-worker wives.
The net effect is to widen the differences
noted in the top half of Table 2.

Since the in-shore wives in our sample
are on the average considerably older than
the deep-sea wives (Table 1), some of their
fertility differences could be merely the result of differences in marital duration.
Similarly, income and educational differences noted in Table 1 between the three
occupational groups could also explain some
of the fertility differences among them.
Consequently, an attempt was made to
determine the effects of husband’s occupation (fishing versus plant work) and type
of fishing (deep-sea versus in-shore) on
fertility with duration of marriage, wife’s
education, and husband’s annual income
controlled by means of multiple regression
analysis. Only respondents who had been
married once and whose husbands had not
changed jobs during marriage were included in the analysis. The results showed
that income and education had little effect
on fertility and that both occupation and
type of fishing retained statistically significant effects with marital duration, income,
and education controlled.

In addition to the occupational differences in fertility, Table 2 also reveals
unusually low levels of reproduction among
wives of fishermen. For example, the average number of live births produced by

Social Biology

women aged 45 and over whose husbands
have done deep-sea fishing throughout
marriage is only 2.61. In light of the rural
residence and the rather low socioeconomic
characteristics of these couples, one would
have expected much higher fertility rates.

NUMBER OF CHILDREN BORN VERSUS DESIRED
AND IDEAL FAMILY SIZE

The low fertility levels led us to examine
the number of children desired by our respondents and the number they considered
ideal for the average Canadian family, in
order to determine the degree to which
their reproduction reflected their fertility
values. In populations where the level of
birth control is generally high, a couple’s
fertility values have a great impact on the
family size it actually achieves. Findings
reported by Ryder and Westoff (1969) for
U.S. couples indicate a sequential pattern
moving from ideal to desired to current to
intended family size. Where, as in the case
of our respondents, effective contraception
is at a minimum, expressed fertility values
have much less relevance for childbearing,
and the number of children produced often
exceeds desired and ideal family size (cf.
Berelson and Freedman, 1964). However,
only the plant-worker wives in our sample
were expected to exhibit this tendency.
With respect to the deep-sea and, to a
lesser extent, the in-shore wives, we expected failure to reach the levels of fertility desired or considered ideal as further
indication of the effects of fishing.

The analysis was done by cross-classifying the number of children born by women
aged 45 years or more with each of the
other measures to determine how many had
produced the exact number of children desired, or considered ideal, and how many
had either exceeded it or produced fewer
children. In addition, mean children born
was compared separately with mean desired
and mean ideal, limiting each comparison

to cases where responses were obtained for
the measures involved.

Again, with due respect to the limitation

cate the expected pattern. None of the
women whose husbands were plant workers
at the time of the survey had fewer children
than they wanted. Over 33 per cent had
more than the desired number, while 54.5
per cent had more than the ideal. The mean
live births figure also is substantially higher
than the mean desired and mean ideal
among these women. A reverse trend is
observed among the wives of in-shore and
deep-sea fishermen. Here the tendency
seems to be to produce fewer children than
the desired or ideal family size. The trend
is stronger among the latter, with 50 per
cent (68 per cent in the case of ideal family
size) reporting fewer children than they
desired.

Note also that in Table 3 the mean desired and ideal family size show much Iess
variation by husband’s occupation than
the mean live births. For example, the
mean number of children desired is almost
identical among deep-sea and _ in-shore

teristics noted earlier among our respondents, this finding, indicating substantial
agreement among them with respect to fertility values, is not very surprising. However, it is important as further indication
of the possible impact of husband’s occupation on the fertility of fishing wives, as it
seems here to severely limit, especially in
the case of deep-sea wives, their ability to
achieve their desired fertility.

TIMING OF CHILDBEARING

The analysis of timing of childbearing is
based on two measures—mean interval between successive births and mean interval
since last birth (Whelpton et al., 1966;
Freedman and Takeshita, 1969). Because
of their limitations (Balakrishnan and
Kantner, 1971), the measures are used
here only as crude indicators of timing of
childbearing. A third measure was computed by expressing the interval since last
birth as a proportion of duration of marDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

riage, in order to control the effects of
intercorrelation between the two factors
(Freedman and Takeshita, 1969). The
analysis of each measure was limited to
respondents who had been married only
once and had borne at least one child.
The results (Table 4) show little varia

is expressed as a proportion of total number
of months married. Thus, it would appear
that fishing, particularly deep-sea fishing,
affects timing of childbearing more by
bringing about an early termination of
childbearing than by increasing the interval between successive births.

tion in the mean interval between births
by husband’s occupation, an indication that
perhaps some effort is made to space births
even by the plant workers. By contrast,
mean interval since last birth varies considerably. As expected, it is longest among
deep-sea wives, followed in order by inshore wives and wives of plant workers.
The differentials are much larger between
deep-sea and in-shore wives than between
the latter and the wives of plant workers.
The pattern is clearer among women aged
40 and over, especially where the husband
had not changed jobs during marriage, and
remains when the interval since last birth

CONTRACEPTIVE PRACTICE AND
STERILIZATION

Contraceptive practice.—Data on contraceptive practice were obtained by asking respondents if they had “ever done anything
to prevent getting pregnant or getting pregnant too frequently.” Those responding
affirmatively were further asked what
methods they had used. Analysis of these
data revealed the following.

1. As may be expected, most of the
younger wives, aged 15-39 years, reported
having used some form of contraception
during marriage. The proportion of users
in this age group ranged from 62 per cent
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

among deep-sea wives to 50 per cent among
plant-worker wives. However, the figures
were much lower among wives aged 40
years or more: 30.6 per cent for in-shore
wives, 25 and 20 per cent respectively for
deep-sea and plant-worker wives.

2. The contraceptive techniques _reported most often by the users were withdrawal or coitus interruptus and _ the
rhythm method, both relatively ineffective
in preventing conception. Reliance on these
two methods was particularly great among
wives Over 39 years of age. Thus, for example, 9 of the 11 users among in-shore
wives in this age group (5 out of 10 among
deep-sea wives) cited either withdrawal or
rhythm as their method of contraception.
Only a small portion of these women used
more effective techniques (such as the pill,
condoms, diaphragms, foams, and intrauterine devices): 12.5, 5.6, and 6.7 per cent
respectively, among deep-sea wives, inshore wives, and plant-worker wives. The
percentages were higher among the younger
wives, but even here dependence on withdrawal and rhythm was often very high.

Only 15 of the 79 women aged 45 and
over in the sample reported ever doing anything to prevent conception; 12 had used
either withdrawal or the rhythm method;
2, the diaphragm; and 1, the condom. Of
the 15 users in this age category, 9 were

contraceptive use and fertility are hardly
surprising. One, the users have much higher
fertility rates than the nonusers, an indication that perhaps many of the users turned
to contraception only after family size had
already become too large. Two, among the
nonusers the original differences in fertility
between deep-sea, in-shore, and plantworker wives remain and seem to increase
in the 45-and-over age group. These two
findings seem to indicate that neither the
overall low levels of fertility nor the pattern of occupational differences reported in
this study may be attributed to contraceptive practice. It must be noted, however,
that our data on contraception deal only
with whether it was ever used and not with
extent of use.

Sterilization—Next, we examined the
possible effects of sterilization on our findings. Nearly 15 per cent of all the wives
interviewed and 35.7 per cent of deep-sea
wives aged 45 years or over reported that
they had undergone operations which made
it impossible for them to bear more children. Although we did not ascertain
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

whether sterilization had been undertaken
for medical or contraceptive reasons, our
analysis indicated that the latter might be
the case. Women who reported being sterilized seemed to have more children on the
average than those not reporting sterilization, especially among women aged 15-44
years. Removal of the sterilized women

of plant workers had higher fertility and
appeared to terminate childbearing later
than both deep-sea and in-shore wives. The

change in the original occupational differences in fertility observed in Table 2. The
only notable exception occurred among
plant-worker wives aged 15-44 years whose
fertility rates dropped slightly because of
the higher fertility of sterilized women in
this category.

DISCUSSION

In spite of the limitations placed on our
analyses by small sample sizes, the results
clearly indicate that fishing employment
may substantially influence fertility behavior: One, wives of fishermen as a group
had remarkably low fertility rates, much
lower than one would expect in light of
their rural residence and low levels of edu
fertility differences remained after the
effects of various demographic and socioeconomic factors were taken into consideration in the analysis.

THE FREQUENCY OF COITUS HYPOTHESIS

The above findings are consistent with
our basic hypothesis that fishing, especially
the deep-sea variety, by repeatedly separating married couples, would tend to reduce

‘chances for coitus and hence depress fer
tility. The deep-sea fishermen in this study
reported regular trips ranging in length
from 5 to 21 days; most of them (78.5
per cent) spent a minimum of 10 days on
each trip, with rest periods of 2-4 days
between trips. The in-shore fishermen

Vol, 22, No. 4

usually made one-day trips; however, they
worked very long hours and were at sea
most nights. Furthermore, as their wives
frequently complained during the interviews, even when the fishermen returned
from sea they spent most of their time with
fellow fishermen, either preparing their
boats for the next trip or “partying.”

The theoretical significance of coital frequency for fertility has been established by
numerous investigations (see especially,
Farris, 1950; Tietze, 1960; Potter, 1961).
The argument developed in these studies
may be summarized as follows. The life
span of both male and female germ cells in
the female tract is very short, and consequently the period within each menstrual
cycle during which coitus may lead to impregnation is limited—on the average perhaps as short as 12-24 hours, and almost
certainly not over 48 hours. If a couple
knew the wife’s fertile period and timed
sexual intercourse accordingly, they could
maximize chances of impregnation with
minimal coitus. However, in the absence of
such knowledge and deliberate planning of
coitus, which is generally the case, the
probability of the coincident presence of
fresh male and female germ cells in the
female tract and hence of impregnation
will tend to increase with the frequency of
coitus, other factors being equal (Pearl,
1939, p. 66).?

Some empirical support for the foregoing hypothesis is provided by studies
reporting positive association between
frequency of coitus and ease of conception
(Stix, 1939; MacLeod and Gold, 1953;
Westoff et al., 1963). However, as yet,
there are virtually no empirical data link
2 Pearl (1939, p. 74) estimated that an average
of 254 copulations were required for each pregnancy, with the figure increasing with age. The
estimates were based on data collected from a
sample of white women in Baltimore. They are
considered a bit too high due perhaps to the
ve infecundity of his sample (see Nag, 1962,
p. 75).

ing frequency of coitus directly with variations in completed family size. This lack
may be due in part to methodological difficulties, since ideally such a study would
require prolonged observation of a group
of couples starting from the time of marriage and covering as much of the female
reproductive ages as possible, under conditions. in which the rate of coitus and
numerous fertility-related variables were
highly controlled. In the absence of such
controlled experiments, much of the existing evidence on the possible effects of
coital frequency on family size is indirect,
often derived from research designs in
which variations in coitus rates are inferred
rather than precisely measured (see, for
example, Musham, 1956; Dorjahn, 1954,
1958).

On thé advice of informers that discussion of respondents’ sexual behavior would
jeopardize our chances for a successful survey, we did not collect data on coital frequency in this study and therefore could
not determine its impact on the observed
fertility patterns in a direct manner. Instead, the inference that the variable may
have a major influence is based largely on
indirect evidence derived from the type of
work the husbands are engaged in and how
often and for how long they are separated
from their wives. We recognize that a variety of factors other than frequency of
coitus, operating either singly or jointly,
could account for our findings.

SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH

As a first step in the further exploration
of the linkages between fishing employment
and fertility suggested by this paper, we
recommend a relatively large-scale study
involving several different types of fishing
villages to increase sample sizes as well as
broaden the empirical bases of the findings.
Such a study could also examine other aspects of fishing and fertility not analyzed

in this study. For example, the average
length of time fishermen spend on fishing
trips and at home between trips could have
an important bearing on the fertility of
deep-sea fishermen. Those who make long
trips and take short rest periods may have
fewer children than those who make short
trips and take long rest periods at home.

Because all our respondents were nativeborn white Protestants, there was no need
to analyze ethnicity and religious affiliation
in this study. Neither did we consider religiosity. In view of the influence that these
variables generally exert on fertility it
would be interesting to explore their role
in future studies of the fishing-fertility relationship. The existence in Atlantic
Canada of predominantly French Catholic
fishing communities ensures that meaningful comparisons involving ethnic-religious
variables can be made.

An important task of future investigations would be to test possible explanations
for the fertility differences observed among
deep-sea fishermen, in-shore fishermen, and
fish-plant workers. We have suggested in
this study that the key variable may be
the frequent sea trips taken by fishermen
and their possible depressing effects on
coitus rates. This hypothesis may be tested
in a more direct manner in future studies
through analysis of detailed histories of
sexual and fertility behavior obtained
through in-depth interviews with fishing
couples.

Another potentially fruitful line of analysis is fishermen’s attitudes towards fertility and family living. Fishing, particularly
deep-sea fishing, is a risky occupation.
Despite the fact that modern fishing boats
are powerful and well equipped to deal
with emergency situations at sea, every
fisherman knows that he may not return
home from a fishing trip as a result of a
severe storm or some other unexpected

Social Biology

event. Perhaps because of the risks associated with their work, and the resulting
feelings of fear and uncertainty, fishermen
often show strong bonds of friendship and
camaraderie, bonds which are further
strengthened by the fact that the men are
often also kinsmen and live in close physical proximity in the fishing villages.

In light of the risks associated with fishing, it may be argued that a man may embrace it as a lifetime occupation only if he
has a minimum of family responsibilities.
If this is true, then either fishing would tend
to attract individuals who attach low evaluations to family living or individuals who
become fishermen would tend to develop
such attitudes. Low fertility desires by
deep-sea fishermen, for example, would
provide a possible explanation for the high
incidence of sterilization found among their
wives and the latter’s apparent inability
to bear the number of children they desire.

Finally, in terms of general implications
for fertility research, this study suggests
two possibilities. First, the general hypothesis that long and repeated separations of
married couples eventually depress fertility may be explored further through
analysis of other occupations that require
husbands to take frequent trips away from
home. Potentially interesting groups in this
respect include long-distance truck drivers,
traveling salesmen, and sailors. Second,
previous research on occupation and fertility has involved global comparisons emphasizing differences between occupations.
This study suggests that analyses based on
specific jobs within individual occupations
also may provide interesting insights on
fertility behavior.
