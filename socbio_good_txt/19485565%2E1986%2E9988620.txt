ABSTRACT: Associations of measures of grandparental status, parental status, cognitive abilities, and personality, and own cognitive abilities and personality with educational and occupational attainment are reported for 249 offspring, now 25 years or older, from the Hawaii Family
Study of Cognition (HFSC). In general, across two ethnic groups (Americans of European ancestry (AEA) and Americans of Japanese ancestry (AJA)), the data suggest that family background had a relatively trivial influence, own cognitive abilities (particularly verbal ability and
general intelligence) substantial influence, and own personality some influence on the educational and occupational attainment of males, while family background had a far more substantial influence than own ability on the attainment of females. Educational attainment was generally found to be substantially predictive of occupational attainment. Hierarchal multiple
regression analyses were conducted to assess the influence of parents’ abilities over and above
grandparental status and the influence of offsprings’ abilities over and above parental status
and abilities on their respective educational and occupational attainments. These analyses also
indicated that family background was a much greater influence than own ability on the attainment of AEA female parents and both AEA and AJA female offspring. These findings for female offspring were further confirmed by analyses of parent-offspring and within-sibship differences in attainment.

pational attainment. A considerable
amount of the variation in attainment is
not accounted for by these factors, and
Jencks et al. (1972) have suggested that
“luck” may be an important factor.

In a previous report (Johnson et al.,
1983) we assessed the influence of family
background, own cognitive abilities,
and own personality on the educational
and occupational attainments of the parents in the Hawaii Family Study of Cognition (HFSC). The HFSC involved the
testing of 6,581 individuals from 1,816
families (both parents and one or more
biological offspring at least 13 years of
age) on a battery of 15 tests of cognitive
ability (see DeFries et al., 1979, and
Wilson et al., 1975, for further descriptions of the HFSC). All subjects also
completed a questionnaire on the home
environment, and well over half of them
were administered a standardized measure of personality, the Adjective Check
List (ACL) (Gough and Heilbrun,
1965). In the report on HFSC parental
attainment we concluded that family
background (the parents’ father’s education and occupation and mother’s education) had a relatively trivial influence, own cognitive abilities a
substantial influence, and own personality some influence on educational and
occupational attainment. Results were
generally consistent across sexes and
ethnic groups (Americans of European
ancestry (AEA) vs. Americans of Japanese ancestry (AJA)), although own
cognitive ability had considerably less
influence on the attainment of AEA
women (many of whom did not work
outside the home, suggesting the presence of restrictions on social mobility
based on merit for this group). In all
cases, the majority of the variance in attainment was not accounted for by the
variables used.

Social Biology

The HFSC families were tested during the years 1973-76, and all of the offspring are now young adults. The
present report presents analyses of data
obtained in a 1983 mail-out questionnaire to a significant portion of the original HFSC families on the educational
and occupational attainment of tested
offspring. As will be described below,
analyses were limited to those offspring
who were 25 years of age or older in
1983. Even with this restriction, however, it is likely that most of the offspring had not reached their final occupational level, although most had
reached their final educational level,
and their results are not entirely comparable to those of their middle-aged parents. Given this caveat, we’ve used this
offspring attainment data, as well as further analyzed the parent attainment
data, to address the following questions.

1. To what extent do parental cognitive abilities and personality influence
offspring educational and occupational
attainment? As has been found in several studies, including Johnson et al.
(1983), one’s own cognitive abilities and
personality are significantly related to
one’s attainment, so it is to be expected
that parental ability and personality are
important components of the genetic
and environmental familial endowment
that would have a “conservative” effect
on offspring attainment and social mobility. Few previous studies have considered these parental variables in their assessments of the relative influence of
family background on attainment.

2. To what extent have the relative
and absolute influence of family background vs. one’s own cognitive abilities
and personality on educational and occupational attainment changed across
generations? Although this comparison
is confounded by age differences be

Vol. 33, No. 1-2

tween the parent and offspring samples,
these results would still be suggestive of
the extent to which degree of meritocracy has changed in American society
(as represented by Hawaii) during the
decades between the time the HFSC
parents were entering the job market
and the present.

3. To what extent are the relative and
absolute influence of family background
vs. one’s Own cognitive abilities and personality on educational and occupational attainment comparable across
sexes and the two major racial/ethnic
groups in Hawali, Americans of European ancestry and Americans of Japanese ancestry? As noted above, in the
analyses of HFSC parental attainment
(Johnson et al., 1983), there was some
evidence for greater restrictions on social mobility based on merit for AEA
women. Historical changes, such as the
Women’s Liberation movement, might
be expected to have lessened or eliminated this sex difference in the influences on attainment of HFSC offspring. Johnson et al. (1983, 1985) have
described how historical changes in social status in Hawaii during the past
forty years have been much greater for
the AJA than for the AEA group. The
parents of the HFSC parents of Japanese ancestry were of considerably
lower educational and occupational attainment than the parents of the HFSC
parents of Caucasian ancestry, but the
two HFSC parent groups were very similar in their mean attainment. Notably,
this greater upward social mobility for
the AJA group was reflected in a somewhat greater influence of own ability on
AJA than on AEA attainment. Since
AEA and AJA HFSC offspring were
reared in families of comparable social
status, it would be expected that the relative influence of family background vs.

Educational and Occupational Attainment 37

own ability and personality on attainment should be similar for the two offspring groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

SUBJECTS

We have the current addresses of approximately 1,200 of the 1,816 original
HFSC families. About half of the lost
families are military families, almost all
Caucasian, tested during the first year of
testing (a five-year residency requirement was added after this first year).
Short questionnaires concerning the educational and occupational attainments
of offspring were mailed to 437 families
for whom we had current addresses.
Families were chosen on two, largely
overlapping bases: (1) having taken part
in a 1976 summer retest session (additional data were available for these subjects) and (2) date of testing (we began
seeking subjects tested at the beginning
of the second year of testing and contacted subjects from that point until
postage monies were expended). Fourteen questionnaires were not deliverable because of incorrect addresses,
with 309 of the remaining 423 families
completing and returning their questionnaires. Reminder letters were sent
to the 114 families that did not respond.
Forty-four more families completed and
returned their questionnaires following
this reminder for a total of 353 families
responding (83.5 per cent of those families contacted).

These families had a total of 561 offspring who took part in the HFSC, with
213 of these offspring 24 years of age or
younger. Preliminary analyses (which
will be briefly reported below) indicated
a cutting point seemed to be present at
age 25. At 24 or younger most of the
subjects were probably still in flux—if in

college, still undergraduates, or if employed, employed at what were likely to
be temporary types of jobs. No magic
change occurs at age 25, but we found
far stronger evidence of permanence
with regard to educational attainment
and occupational stability among subjects 25 years of age or older. Though
this is admittedly a somewhat arbitrary
cut, we felt that enough of a qualitative
difference existed between persons 25
years of age or older, as opposed to 24
years of age or younger, that we have
limited our analyses to the 249 subjects
25 years of age or older from the two
major ethnic groups in the HFSC,
Americans of European and Japanese
ancestries. The ages, sexes, and racial/
ethnic backgrounds of these subjects are
presented in Table 1. Data are also reported separately for unmarried vs.
married subjects.

Social Biology

MEASURES

We had comparatively few measures
of the HFSC parents’ family background. These were the reported years
of education of these parents’ mothers
and fathers and the reported occupational attainment of their fathers, i.e.,
the reported attainments of the grandparents of the HFSC offspring. Much
more information is available regarding
the family background of the offspring. ©
All parents provided information regarding their own educational and occupational attainments, all parents were
tested on the battery of cognitive measures described below, and the majority
of parents provided personality data as
well (also described below). Educational level of the offspring was coded
using the following scale: (1) some high
school, (2) high school graduate, (3)

some college, (4) college graduate, (5)
some post-graduate education, and (6)
post-graduate degree. These codes were
then converted into years of education
for comparability with the parent data.
Occupational level was scored through
National Opinion Research Council
(NORC) ratings (Reiss et al., 1961) for
the grandfathers, the parents, and the
offspring. The mean years of education
and NORC ratings of the HFSC offspring used in the present analyses are
also reported in Table 1.

The measures of cognition consisted
of 15 cognitive tests (see DeFries et al.,
1979; Wilson et al., 1975, for a description of these measures). These tests
loaded on four factors—Verbal Ability,
Spatial Ability, Perceptual Speed and
Accuracy, and Visual Memory Ability
(DeFries et al., 1979; Wilson et al.,
1975). The unrotated first principal
component correlated 0.73 with full
scale Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale
scores and may be regarded as a measure of general intelligence (Kuse,
1977). All cognition factor scores were
age-corrected by standardizing scores
within age bands.

The personality data consist of factor
scores derived from the Adjective
Check List (ACL) (Gough and
Heilbrun, 1965). The ACL was routinely administered during several years
of testing to a total of 3,411 subjects.
The ACL is a 300-adjective checklist

originally scored by Gough and.

Heilbrun to yield 24 scale scores. Because of criticisms with regard to the
lack of independence and poor psychometric properties of these scales (Masterson, 1975), it was decided to rescore
the 300 items of the ACL, using the
results of an item factor analysis by
Parker and Veldman (1969). Parker and
Veldman’s analyses yielded the follow
Educational and Occupational Attainment 39

ing seven factors, for which alpha reliability coefficients calculated on the 3,411
HFSC individuals who took the ACL,
the number of adjectives loading on the
factor, and some representative adjectives are given in parentheses: Social
Desirability (0.90; 28 items; pleasant,
kind, warm); Interpersonal Abrasiveness (0.65; 9 items; rude, lazy, foolish);
Ego Organization (0.87; 20 items; industrious, thorough, efficient); Introversion-Extraversion (0.66; 8 items;
quiet, silent vs. talkative, outgoing); Internal Discomfort (0.79; 14 items; emotional, nervous, worrying); Intraception
(0.71; 9 items; reflective, unconventional, idealistic); and Social Attractive
ness (0.76; 10 items; polished, clever,

charming). The seven scale scores were
empirically corrected for the total number of adjectives checked by obtaining
the linear and quadratic regression coefficients of each raw scale score on the
number of adjectives checked for the
entire sample and computing the residuals for each scale. Since all seven of the
scales were significantly correlated with
age, even after the correction for number of adjectives checked, the scale
scores were also age-corrected by removing, via regression, the linear and
quadratic components due to age. All
scale scores were then converted to
standard scores, and the analyses presented herein are based on these standard scores.

RESULTS

The correlations of grandparent education and occupation, parent cognitive
abilities, ACL factors, education, and
occupation, and own cognitive abilities
and ACL factors on offspring educational and occupational attainment
(plus the correlation of own education

with occupation) are presented separately by sex and ethnicity (AEA vs.
AJA) in Table 2. Variables equivalent
to those used in Johnson et al. (1983) to
predict HFSC parents’ educational and
occupational attainment have been underlined for comparison purposes. In
general these correlations are similar to
those found by Johnson et al. (1983)
with regard to parent attainment, indicating a small but fairly consistent influence of family background, a substantial influence of own verbal ability and
general intelligence, and some influence
of own personality on offspring attainment. As noted above, we were concerned about the effect of age on these
correlations. To test for this, the above
correlations were run separately on the
entire offspring sample for males and females 20 to 24 years of age, 25 and 26
years of age, and 27 to 40 years of age.
The overall findings from these analyses
were that the 20 to 24 year groups had
more significant correlations of parental
attributes with achievement (18 out of
104 vs. 15 out of 104 for the 25 and 26
year groups and 10 out of 104 for the
27+ year groups) and fewer significant
correlations of own attributes with
achievement (7 out of 50 vs. 12 out of 50

 

Social Biology

for the 25 and 26 year groups and 16 out
of 50 for the 27+ year groups) than did
older subjects. These findings seem to
support the reasons cited above for limiting our analyses to subjects 25 years of
age and older.

One advantage of using the present
age range of subjects is that a significant
proportion of them had not yet married,
allowing for analyses of the effect of
early vs. late (or non-) marriage on educational and occupational attainment.
The small sample number does not permit analyses of the influence of marital
status on attainment separately by ethnic groups, but the proportions of unmarried vs. married persons were similar across the AEA and AJA groups. As
can be discerned in Table 1, however,
substantially more females than males
have married, and sex differences in
mean educational and occupational attainment differ across marital status.
Analyses of variance of offspring educational and occupational attainment by
sex and marital status revealed no significant main effects, but did produce
significant interactions for both educational (F=15.42, df=1, 208, p
<0.001) and occupational (F= 4.49,
df = 1, 208, p < 0.05) attainment, such

reverse was true for females. This may
mean that males still are viewed as the
primary providers in a marriage and are
more often expected to postpone marriage until they can fulfill this role. The
correlations of grandparent attainment,
parent attainment, cognitive abilities,
and personality, and own cognitive abilities and personality with offspring educational and occupational attainment
are presented separately by sex and
marital status in Table 3. In general,
both family background and own ability
appeared to have a greater influence on
the attainment of unmarried as opposed
to married males, while the reverse was
true for females. As was also the case in
Table 2, mother’s education and occupation were substantially correlated
with the attainment of female offspring.

Since a major focus of the present
analyses was to assess the extent to
which own cognitive ability and personality was predictive of offspring educational and occupational attainment over
and above the influence of family back

ground, hierarchical multiple regression
analyses similar to those used in the
Johnson et al. (1983) report on parent
attainment were also performed on the
offspring data. In the regressions used in
the Johnson et al. report parent educational attainment was regressed on
grandfather education and NORC code
and grandmother education entered as a
block in the first step, parent first principal component (general intelligence)
was entered as the second step, and parent personality scales were entered as a
block in stepwise order in the third step,
retaining only those scales that accounted for a significant (p < 0.05)
amount of additional explained variance. The regressions on parent occupational attainment were similar, except
that parents’ own education was entered
as the third step before entering personality. These regressions were done separately by sex and ethnic group (AEA vs.
AJA). For comparison purposes, Tables 4 and 5 reproduce the Johnson et al.
multiple regression results for the sample of HFSC parents administered the
ACL.

ment on family background (parent variables) and own cognitive ability and
personality were similar to those used in
Johnson et al. (1983), except that midparent first principal component scores
were entered as the first step before entering the other family background variables, father education and NORC and
mother education. Mother NORC was
again not used, since many mothers,
particularly in the AEA group, did not
work outside of the home. The results of
these regression analyses on offspring

in comparing the parent and offspring
results, both because of the age confound mentioned earlier and because
the numbers are considerably smaller

and offspring generations. However, in
contrast to the parent results, the educational and occupational attainment of

than was the case with male offspring.
Few ACL scales accounted for a significant amount of additional explained
variance in predicting offspring attainment, but this may have been due to the
small sample sizes. The total amount of
variance accounted for by the variables
fluctuates more for the offspring than
for the parent regressions, which is
probably another function of the sample
size, but in no case is a majority of the

Two further tests of the finding that

less influenced by their own ability than

DISCUSSION

In contrast to the results of the studies cited in the Introduction, analyses of
both HFSC parent and offspring attainment indicate that family background
generally had a relatively small influence on attainment, whereas own
cognitive ability (particularly verbal
ability and general intelligence) had a
substantial influence over and above the
influence of family background for all
groups of males and for AJA mothers.
Family background did have a far
greater influence relative to own abilities on the attainment of AEA mothers
and both AEA and AJA female offspring. The families recruited for the
HFSC were of somewhat higher mean

Social Biology

socioeconomic status than the population average, although a wide range of
statuses was represented, so restriction
of range could account for some of the
lack of a stronger influence of family
background on attainment. Also of note
is that the relative influence of family
background vs. own ability on attainment was generally consistent across
generations, in spite of the age difference between the parent and offspring
samples. This may be cautiously interpreted as indicating that degree of social
mobility through ability, as well as the
sex difference in degree of mobility discussed below, has not changed in American society over the past twenty or so
years. Parental cognitive ability and personality were found to have some if inconsistent effects on offspring attainment and are probably important
factors to consider in defining those aspects of family background that do have
an influence on attainment.

As was the case with the Johnson et
al. (1983) report on HFSC parent attainment, own personality, particularly the
ACL factors Ego Organization (ego
strength) and Intraception (independence), had inconsistent but at times
substantial influence on offspring attainment. There is clearly a need, however,
to use more refined personality measures to get at those aspects of personality most relevant to educational and occupational attainment, e.g., Machiavellianism (Turner and Martinez, 1977).

Cross-generational comparisons of
the multiple regression results indicate
that differences in the parent generation
between the AEA and AJA ethnic
groups in the relative influence of family
background vs. own ability on attainment have largely disappeared in the
offspring generation. It could be argued
that the greater social mobility available

to the AJA parents as compared to the
AEA parents was sufficient to overcome the restrictions, which seemed to
be present for AEA female parents, on
the attainment of women through merit.
These restrictions, whether the result of
sex discrimination and/or societal expectations regarding marriage and family, are apparently still present in American society, as the results on the
attainment of both AEA and AJA female offspring indicate.

Finally, it should again be noted that
most of the variance in attainment was
not accounted for by the variables used
in any of our analyses. While some of
this is undoubtedly due to unreliability

of the measures, as was also stated in
Johnson et al. (1983), “chance” may in
fact play a large role in educational and
occupational attainment.
