ABSTRACT: The gene and phenotype frequencies for the ABO blood groups system were studied
in two socioeconomically different subpopulations of Santiago, Chile. The data were taken from
the maternity services and blood banks of two hospitals, one serving mainly low socioeconomic
classes and the other serving middle and high socioeconomic groups. Results show a clear
difference in gene and phenotype frequencies between the two subpopulations, a difference
maintained in two generations (mothers and their children). These results reinforce other studies
showing that socioeconomic forces have resulted in assortative mating and different genetic

subpopulations in Chile.

The population of Santiago can be segmented into a variety of socioeconomic
and cultural classes as can most, if not all,
urban populations. In Chile there are studies suggesting that these different urban
socioeconomic classes have different genetic compositions (see, for example, the
ABO blood group studies of PintoCisternas et al., 1971; Rothhammer, 1973;
and Palomino, 1976). If this is also true of
Santiago, we would expect to find different gene frequencies in the different socioeconomic groups. Since human matings
probably occur in an assortative way with
respect to socioeconomic variables, the
evolution of these populations will be
conditioned by their socioeconomic structures.

The Chilean population stems mainly
from the admixture of Spanish people with
Chilean aborigines. The ABO blood group
frequencies in these two peoples were very
different. While the aborigines were pre
sumably all of type O, the Spanish settlers
had types A and B in appreciable frequencies. Thus, the occurrence of types A
and B may be correlated with the degree
of Spanish or European admixture. The
papers cited above suggest that the upper
socioeconomic classes have higher frequencies of types A and B than do lower
socioeconomic classes.

Our aims in this paper are threefold.
First, we will show that there are significant differences between two very different socioeconomic subpopulations of
Santiago in their ABO blood group phenotypes and in the frequencies of the alleles
O, A, and B. Second, we will show that
the socioeconomic structure conditions the
mating structure in the population of Santiago in such a way that the gene frequencies of mothers and their children are almost the same within each socioeconomically defined subpopulation, that is to
say, there is a strong tendency toward as

226

sortative matings. Finally, we will show
that one needs to be very cautious when
interpreting gene frequencies obtained
after assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

Chilean health service benefits reach
Chileans either through the National
Health Service or through private medical
practice. In general, the latter benefits the
middle and upper socioeconomic classes;
the former, the lower ones. Among the
benefits available to all groups are maternity services and blood banks. Maternity
services offer an opportunity to study the
gene frequencies of mothers, who represent one generation, and their infants,
who represent another. Blood banks
permit one to study a sample of donors
which presumably represents the general
population from which the mothers are
drawn. The relation between the gene frequencies of the mothers and the gene frequencies of their husbands can be studied
through the phenotypes of children born to
O blood group mothers. Helpful in this
context is the method of stochastic matrices of conditional probabilities developed by Li and Sacks (1954), Li (1958,
1969) and applied recently by Harb and
Valenzuela (1976).

population frequencies. A, B, O, and AB
are the phenotypes of this blood group
system. 7 is a particular matrix that describes the conditional probabilities between individuals related as mother-child.
The elements of this matrix are given in
Table 1. It should be noted that in this
matrix the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
has been assumed, but it is possible to
construct a matrix which does not make
this assumption by adding the appropriate
coefficients related to conditions which
lead to an equilibrium different from the
Hardy-Weinberg.

Children born to mothers belonging to
the O blood group represent a direct sample of the fathers’ gene pool, as is demonstrated in Table 2. Again, if mating is at
random, f,, fg, and fg calculated by this
method will be equal to p, g, and r of the
general fathers’ population. If panmixia
does not obtain, then this statement does
not hold; but the frequencies f,, f, and fo
will then provide insight into the nature of
the deviation from simple randomness.

Children born to O-blood mothers represent a population backcross. The phenotypic frequencies obtained from these
children are directly the gene frequencies
of their fathers. It is thus possible to obtain
the variance-covariance matrix of p, q,
and r for the fathers, as a simple variance-covariance matrix of a trinomial distribution (Lebart and Fenelon, 1973).
However, since p + q +7 = 1, it is sufficient to work with two frequencies. We

have chosen p and g to obtain the estimators needed in the next stage of our
analysis. The variance-covariance matrix
under discussion is shown in Table 3. The
sum of the elements of this matrix is the
variance of 7. The gene frequencies obtained in this manner can readily be
shown to be a sufficient statistic and therefore maximum likelihood estimators
(Mood and Graybill 1963).

Gene frequencies from data belonging
to mothers and their children and from the
blood banks were calculated by the maximum likelihood method as shown in Stevens (1938). This method also gives a good
approximation to the variance-covariance
of the gene frequencies estimators. We
used Bernsteins’ coefficient statistics (Ca
valli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971) as trial
values to initiate the iterative procedure
which culminates in the maximum likelihood estimates. We have also calculated
gene frequencies from the matrix of mother-child phenotypes. This matrix is given
in Table 4 and can be used to generate a
polynomial distribution from which we
have obtained the maximum likelihood
estimators of p, qg, and r (Li, 1958). This
method enables one to use all of the information present in the mother-child combinations.

In Table 4, we again assume a
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. It is also
possible to construct the variance-covariance matrix of the gene frequencies directly from the maximum likelihood estimates as has been previously shown in
Table 3. The actual number of independent genes can be obtained by dividing the
elements of the variance-covariance matrix of the gene frequencies by the corresponding ones in the variance-covariance
matrix of the gene frequencies estimators.

Theoretical numbers can be obtained as
has been shown by Li (1958); but since
genetic dominance introduces complications into these calculations, we have chosen to work with the actual numbers. The
latter are slightly different if one chooses
the variance of p, or the covariance of p
and g, or the variance of g; these numbers
also differ slightly from the limits within
which the theoretical numbers must lie.
We have used the smallest actual number
in al} cases to avoid artificially increasing
the significances of the statistics. This procedure introduces an element of approximation in the computation of the Hotelling
T? and F; but since the numbers which are
used are large, we believe the true values
of T? and F to be little different from the
calculated ones.

Now, given p and gq, and their respective variances and covariances from two
samples, it is possible to calculate the
Statistical significance of a bivariate Hotelling 7? (Morrison 1967). The computation proceeds as follows:

N,N
TY = TN, (Ps — po, 11

— ge) $72 Py -f
G2) os oP

where the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate
samples 1 and 2, N is the sample size or
the actual number and 5S, is the pooled
variance-covariance matrix which corresponds to

St = (NV, + No _ 2)7!
(Vy — Si + We — 1)So].

The significance of the T? is obtained by
an F test, where
_ N, + No _ d — 1 2

and d is one of the two degrees of freedom

The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for
phenotypes was checked by squaring the
gene frequencies (p + g +7) obtained and
then applying the y? test for phenotypes as
found in Cavalli-Sforza (1971).

SAMPLES

Our samples of observations were
drawn from the Hospital San José (HSJ), a
National Health Service Hospital in the
northern part of Santiago, and from the
Clinica Alemana (CAL), a private clinic
located in the eastern part of Santiago
whose patients are predominantly from
the middle and upper socioeconomic classes. In these hospitals we obtained data
from the maternity services on mothers
and their children and from donors to the
blood bank at HSJ and receptors at CAL.
We choose blood bank receptors at CAL
rather than donors on the assumption that
the donors may not belong to the same
socioeconomic levels as the mothers.
Blood typing of infants was done at birth
from cord blood.

RESULTS

The phenotypic distributions of the
mothers, children, donors (HSJ), and receptors (CAL) are shown in Tables 5 and
6. The significance of the difference in the
phenotypic distribution between the hospitals for these various classes of individuals has been tested by chi-square. Significance is assumed if the observed deviation exceeds that predicted by chance
one in twenty times, which corresponds to
a chi-squre of 7.81 for three degrees of
freedom and 5.99 for two degrees of free
' It is also possible to treat the product (p; — po, ¢1

— g2) S' : ~ Pa as a chi-square value and then
1 ~ ¥2
to obtain significance level with one degree of freedom. This can be done because N, and N2 are large
numbers.

dom. Table 7 gives the results of these
tests. The frequencies and the method
used to estimate them are shown in Table
8. We tested the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with p, g, and r calculated from
one source of data and phenotypic numbers from the same or another source
(Table 9). A comparison between the HSJ
and CAL samples was not made, since the
phenotypic distribution revealed these

229

samples to be drawn from different populations (see Table 7). The chi-square test
where p, g, and r and the phenotypic frequencies belong to the same sample has
one degree of freedom. Two degrees of
freedom are lost in estimating p and q
from the observed distribution of phenotypes (Cavalli-Sforza, 1971; Li, 1958). Ifp,
g, andr belong to a different sample, then
the chi-square test has three degrees of
freedom.

These last tests, those in Table 9, must
be interpreted with care. There are striking differences when comparing reciprocal
situations, that is to say, if one compares
the chi-square values calculated applying
~, g, andr of sample A with phenotypes of
sample B with chi-square values calculated applying gene frequencies of B with
phenotypes from A, substantial differences are seen. This happens because the
~, g, and r of any one sample are not
estimated without error; their variance or
confidence intervals need to be considered.
Thus, the only clear significance is that
found within CAL’s children. The significance between matrix-donors from HSJ
and matrix-children from CAL needs to be
discussed further.

To solve the problem of interpretation
mentioned above, it is necessary to include

? In this case we are assuming that p, g, andr are
the parameters of the population.

gene frequencies and their variances when
comparing two samples, which was done
by the method previously described (TJ?
and F test). The results are presented in
Table 10. For 2 and more than 120 degrees
of freedom, the 0.05 level of significance
corresponds to an F value of 3.00. The
0.01 level of significance is reached with F
values over 4.61. Table 10 demonstrates

clearly the existence of two samples with
different gene frequencies and supports
the need for caution in evaluating the chisquare values of Table 9.

We have calculated », g, and 7 for all
individuals either from CAL or HSJ, and
with these frequencies we have tested the
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The values
for p, g, andr were 0.19547, 0.05972, and
0.74481 respectively, and the chi-square
value was 3.49 with one degree of freedom
(p > 0.05).

Finally, we examined the phenotypic
matrices to see whether they were distributed according to the Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium. The chi-square values for the
CAL matrix and for the HSJ matrix were
10.59 and 9.86 respectively, which are not
significant with eleven degrees of freedom.

DISCUSSION

Since different socioeconomic levels in
the populations of admission are assured
by the different admission requirements of
the hospitals, our data support the view
that the genetic compositions of these socioeconomically different populations are
different. Previous studies have also
reached this same conclusion. Here, how

ever, we add evidence that not only do the
phenotypic distributions differ but so too
do the gene frequencies. We also show
that these differences are maintained at
least for two consecutive generations.

It is necessary for further discussion
to emphasize the different degrees of socioeconomic heterogeneity within each
group. While the HSJ sample represents
an almost homogeneous population from a
socioeconomic viewpoint, the CAL sample
involves a range of socioeconomic groups,
one extending from the middle to the highest socioeconomic levels. We believe this
difference is why there is no significance in
the chi-square test for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the HSJ samples (see
Table 9). The significance seen when 9, g,
and r from T matrix are used to calculate
expected values of donors’ phenotypes can
be explained as a result of not considering
the variance of », g, and r and from the
further possibility that the donors are not
drawn from the same population as the
mothers. Donors need not be beneficiaries
of the National Health Services.

The chi-square for the Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium in the CAL sample of children
is significant at the 0.02 level. It is clear
then that the children are not from a generation in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
or alternatively that the mothers are not

from the generation of their children. The
significance seen when the ?, g, and r calculated from the 7-matrix on the phenotypes of children is used can also be explained; it is a consequence of the failure
to take cognizance of the gene frequency
variances. It is also possible, of course,
that this latter significance stems from a
deviation from panmixia, but the number
of observations needed to establish this
fact unequivocally would be very large.
The use of J matrices to estimate gene
frequencies represents an alternative approach to the methods of Bernstein or the
classic maximum likelihood technique. It
requires, however, that the recessive homozygote genotypes be in sufficient number, since the variances of estimators will
be small. The JT matrix approach yields
maximum likelihood estimates directly
and does not necessarily assume that the
population sampled is in panmictic equilibrium. We have shown that children
seen at the CAL do not fit the HardyWeinberg equilibrium, but their gene frequencies do not differ significantly from
those of their mothers. These two statements may be interpreted by assuming
that the fathers of these children do not
differ from the mothers in their gene frequencies, but that some sort of assortative
mating is occurring. This interpretation
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

232

would be in agreement with the known
heterogeneous socioeconomic composition
of the CAL sample. Of course, it is possible also that a small difference in gene
frequencies between fathers and mothers
may exist, but the method is not sufficient
to demonstrate it. Evidence for assortative
mating is necessarily indirect because paternal blood typing was not possible. In
the HSJ observations where there is more
socioeconomic homogeneity, no discrepancy with the Hardy-Weinberg assumptions is found.

The most conspicuous of our results is
the sharp difference in phenotypes and in
gene frequencies between the CAL and
HSJ samples. This finding strongly suggests that there are at least two subpopulations in the population of Santiago.
Since these differences are maintained
over two generations (mother and children), it is possible to conclude that the
socioeconomic factor is a very important
one in the origin and maintenance of these
subpopulational differences. It remains for
further studies to demonstrate if socioeconomic or cultural factors predominate in
the maintenance of these subpopulations.

When the data from both samples are
mixed, as if they were a larger sample of
the population of Santiago, the results are
striking. There is no significant deviation
from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, although we know that the samples belong
to at least two very different populations.
This result is explicable. First, the equations of estimation from which the gene
frequencies are derived assume an equilibrium (except for the T matrix method);
and second, the test of equilibrium has a
very large Type II statistical error (8 error). This last result emphasizes the need
to be extremely cautious in interpreting
the presence or absence of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium when the classic methods
of gene frequency estimation and analysis
are used.

Valenzuela and Harb

Social Biology

There are two technical considerations
to be mentioned. First, it is possible that
the ABO blood system cannot be typed so
clearly from infant cord blood as it can
from the blood samples from the mothers.
The other possible source of technical
error is the misclassification of the weak
subgroups of A and B groups. They can be
taken as O group (Race and Sanger 1968).
If this is happening in our samples, as we
suppose, then the actual significance of
our results might be larger than those
found.

Finally, we want to point out that maternity data are easily available. For purposes of comparison, it would be very interesting to have a study of another population where socioeconomic, cultural, and
genetic conditions are different from those
found in Santiago.

SUMMARY

The gene and the phenotypic frequencies for the ABO blood groups system
were studied in two socioeconomically different subpopulations of Santiago, Chile.
The data were taken from the maternity
services and blood banks of two hospitals,
namely: (1) Hospital San José (HSJ), belonging to the National Health Service
and serving mainly low socioeconomic
classes; (2) Clinica Alemana (CAL), a private hospital serving middle and high socioeconomic classes.

Gene frequencies were obtained from
mothers, children (newborn infants), donors to HSJ blood banks and receptors of
CAL blood banks by the maximum likelihood method applied to phenotypes. The
stochastic matrix method of mother-child
relationship was also used in order to find
the fathers’ gene frequencies.

Results show a clear difference in phenotypic and gene frequencies between the

Vol. 24, No. 3

two subpopulations. This difference was
maintained in two generations (mothers
and their children). The fathers’ gene frequencies were not different from the
mothers gene frequencies in each subpopulation.

These results reinforce the statement
that there are socioeconomic forces producing assortative mating in Santiago.
