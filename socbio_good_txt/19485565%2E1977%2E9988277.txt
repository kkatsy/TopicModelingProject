Genetical Concepts and IQ

Most psychometricians accept the
applicability of Fisher’s (1918) model of
assortative mating to IQ. One of the most
vigorous exponents of the relevance of genetics to IQ is Arthur Jensen. His writings
are prolific, and it would be natural for the
next generation of psychometricians to
study his work. Unfortunately, the very
small sections of his work that concern
genetical concepts show some confusion
and are, in places, totally inaccurate. It is
therefore important that researchers in
fields of genetics and IQ be aware of the
deficiencies in his excursions into genetics.

JENSEN’S INDEX OF HERITABILITY

Jensen (1967) criticizes Holzinger’s and
Nichol’s index and gives his own index for
measuring heritability as (ryz — rpz/(1 —
Poo), Where %¢ = phenotypic correlation
between monozygotic twins, 7pz = phenotypic correlation between dizygotic twins,
and p,. = genetic correlation between sibs.
He gives no proof that his index measures
heritability as defined genetically. The
formula contains p,,, the genetic correlation between sibs which can not be measured directly. He suggests that p,, should
be obtained from the formula p,, = (1 +
Ppp) (2 + Ppp), Where Ppp is the genetic
correlation between mates, and gives Li

 

(1955, Chap. 13) as reference for this formula. It does not, however, appear there,
and Prof. Li informs me (private communication) that he had not seen this formula before. In any case, it is incorrect.
Moreover, it does not overcome the
difficulty of finding genetic correlation.
We now require the genetic correlation between mates which can be obtained from
their phenotypic correlation if heritability
is known. Thus, to use Jensen’s index to
find heritability, a value of that heritability is required.

Neither does the formula ensure that the
value of heritability will be less than 1.
Jensen’s index using the above formula for
Poo can be written as (v2 — Tpz) (2 + Poo):
If we take ryz = 1, Ypz = 0.5, which
Jensen also takes, heritability will always
be greater than 1 if the population is
mating assortatively. Note that Jensen’s
estimate of heritability, presumably broad
heritability, of IQ as 0.8 is based on this
formula (Jensen, 1967).

PARENT-CHILD CORRELATION

Jensen (1969, p. 46) says, “The genetic
correlation between the average of both
parents (called the ‘midparent’) and a single offspring (rz.) is the square root of the
correlation for a single parent (i.e., 7, =
V¥o,). The correlation between the aver

age of both parents and the average of all
offspring (‘midchild’) that they could
theoretically produce (7p) is the same
value as Hy, i.e., heritability in the narrow
sense.” He does not say whether the relation % = Vrp holds for a population
mating at random or for one mating assortatively. In any case, it does not appear to be
correct.

Fisher (1918) shows that for a population mating at random the covariance between parent and child, in Fisher’s
notation, is 48? for one factor. Summing
over all factors, the covariance will be 4V,
where V, is the additive variance.
Midparent and child covariance will be
the same. Assuming equilibrium, the variance of the children will be the same as
that of parents. Therefore,

Thus,

For a population mating assortatively,
with yp, as the coefficient of assortative
mating, Fisher (1918) gives the formula
(for correction, see Vetta, 1976), parent
child covariance = midparent-child
covariance = $V, (1 + 4yp,), and
Var(parent) = £Var(child) = _ YV,;z;

Var(midparent) = 3V, (1 + up). Therefore,

It would therefore appear that Jensen’s
formula is not correct.

 

SIB CORRELATION

Jensen (1969, p. 46) says, “The correlation is also between .50 and .60 for
siblings on these characteristics; sibling resemblance is generally much higher than
this for traits of Jow heritability.” It needs
to be stated clearly that low heritability is
not the cause of high correlation between
sibs and that low heritability in itself
would not suggest a high sib correlation. If
a trait with low heritability and high sib
correlation could be found, the likely explanation of high sib correlation will lie in
similarity of environment. Moreover, it is
not absolutely clear that Fisher’s (1918)
model could be used in such a situation.

Jensen (1973, p. 108), says, “the theoretical genetic correlation og; [presumably a
misprint for pg] between siblings (when
there is no genetic correlation between
their parents) is 0.50. If the parents have
some degree of genetic resemblance, the
correlation between siblings will be
slightly greater than 0.50.” On page 112 he
says, “Therefore, the absolute deviation of
the sibling correlation from 0.50 provides
a rough index of the degree of non-genetic
variance in the measurements. (It is a
‘rough’ index because the theoretical genetic correlation between sibs is 0.50 only
under assortative mating and when there
is no dominance variance . . .).” In this
passage he probably wanted to say “only
in the absence of assortative mating” in
place of “only under assortative mating.”

Jensen (1973, p. 47 and p. 108) uses hh?
to represent the ratio of genetic variance

168 Brief Reports

to the phenotypic variance, i.e., broad
heritability. Geneticists usually use 4? to
represent narrow heritability, i.e., the
ratio of additive variance to the phenotypic variance. This usage difference
could lead to confusion, and in Jensen’s
case it did lead to confusion. He says (Jensen, 1973, p. 112), “itis evident that as the
value of k? approaches 1.00, the sibling
correlation, r,, must converge on 0.5.”
This would happen only if dominance
variance converges to 0, i.e., when broad
heritability equals narrow heritability and
only in the absence of environmental effects and assortative mating.

Jensen (1973, p. 112) goes on to say,
“While it is possible to obtain sibling
correlations of close to 0.50 when the
value of /:? is low, itis impossible to obtain
sibling correlations that depart significantly from 0.50 when h? is very high.” It
is difficult to justify this statement. If
broad heritability is low, the genetic
component of sib covariance will also be
low; hence, ignoring environmental covariance, the sib correlation will be low. It
is easy to see why this should be so in the
case of a population mating at random. V,
= Vg + V, where Vg and V, are the genetic
and environmental variances respectively.
Also, Vg = V4 + Vp where Vy, and Vp are
the additive and dominance variances respectively. If Jensen’s /?, i.e., broad
heritability, is low, then Vg is small as
compared with V,. Sib covariance under
random mating is 4V4 + %Vp which will
be small as compared with V,. Clearly, sib
correlation will not equal 0.5 when Vg is
small. If, however, #? is high, i.e., V, is
small as compared with V,, then sib
correlation could be near 0.5. Any
deviation from this value could reflect environmental or dominance effects or both.

POLYGENIC HYPOTHESIS AND

GALTON’S LAW OF REGRESSION
Jensen (1969) says, “None of these
findings is at all surprising from the

Social Biology

standpoint of a genetic hypothesis, of
which an intrinsic feature is Galton’s ‘law
of filial regression.’ He advocates the
polygenic hypothesis, assuming Mendelian inheritance. There are, however, other
hypotheses—for example, the hypothesis
of determinantal inheritance—which take
account of the observed phenomenon of
regression to the mean. Moreover,
Galton’s law of regression is not an intrinsic feature of the polygenic hypothesis. If a
trait is completely determined genetically,
there will be no regression of progeny
mean on midparent. The observed regression occurs because genotype determines
phenotype imperfectly.

Jensen (1973), comparing the IQ’s of
sibs of chosen groups of children from the
two ethnic groups, shows some confusion
concerning the meaning of sibling regression to the mean. Thoday (1973) clarifies
this confusion.

The above discussion concerns a population mating at random. In the presence
of assortative mating and dominance, Jensen (1973, p. 112) says, “Since assortative
mating and dominance deviation have opposite effects on the genetic correlation between siblings, their effects tend to cancel
out, so that 0.50 is probably the best
overall estimate of the genetic correlation
between sibs.” While it is true that dominance and assortative mating act in opposite directions so far as sib correlation is
concerned, it is not true that their effects
tend to cancel out. Under assortative
mating, the relation between heritability
and sib correlation is rather complex.

CONTROL OF HERITABLE TRAITS

Jensen (1969, p. 45) says, “Heritability
also tells us something about the locus of
control of a characteristic. The control of

- highly heritable characteristics is usually

in the organism’s internal biochemical
mechanisms. Traits of low heritability are
usually controlled by external environ

mental factors.” Since most, if not all, genetic factors are fundamentally biochemical in action, this seems to be little more
than a truism. More light is thrown on the
question by Falconer (1972, p. 167) who
says, “On the whole, the characters with

169

lowest heritability are those most closely
connected with reproductive fitness, while
the characters with the highest heritabilities are those that might be judged on
biological grounds to be the least important as determinants of natural fitness.”
