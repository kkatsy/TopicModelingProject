ABSTRACT: Demographic factors and patterns of substance use among women who did not consume alcohol during pregnancy were compared to women who did consume alcohol during
pregnancy. One-hundred seventy-seven Northern Plains Indian women who received prenatal
care at an urban clinic in a rural state were screened for substance use as part of the validation
study with a self-administered questionnaire. Women who drank during pregnancy were more
likely to be single and have less education than women who did not drink. While most of the
women in the study had available transportation resources, the women who drank during pregnancy were less likely to have transportation than the women who did not drink. Women who
drank during pregnancy consumed more alcohol more frequently before pregnancy than did
women who drank before but not during pregnancy. Compared to women who did not drink
during pregnancy, women who drank during pregnancy were more likely to smoke cigarettes
and use illicit drugs, to have parents who drank, to feel they drank the same or more than other
pregnant women, or to have experienced more relationship breakups and physical and emotional abuse. Prenatal patients who drink alcohol during pregnancy need more intensive counseling regarding their multiple risk behaviors.

Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy can affect fetal development resulting in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)
and other alcohol-related effects that produge life-long disabilities for the individual (Hungerford et al., 1994). Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading preventable
cause of mental retardation 1n this country (Abel, 1987). The higher rates of fetal
alcohol syndrome reported among American Indians compared to other populations may reflect the fact that FAS has
been studied more rigorously in the
American Indian/Alaska Native populations and may be better recognized by
clinicians who provide care to American
Indians (Duimstra et al., 1993; Harwood
et al., 1985; May, 1983; Burd et al.,
1994).

The Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service has developed and validated a self-administered questionnaire to screen for prenatal alcohol use in Northern Plains Indian
women (Gale et al., 1998; Bad Heart Bull
et al., 1999; Li et al., in press). This study
examines the maternal and prenatal factors
that were associated with alcohol use in the
study that validated the screening tool (Bad
Heart Bull et al., 1998).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

As part of a validation study for a selfadministered substance-use screening
questionnaire (SAQ), patients were asked
to complete the SAQ on their first prenatal visit as part of routine prenatal care.
The patients completed the questionnaire

214

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

while waiting to see their primary health
care provider (Bad Heart Bull et al.,
1999).

A public health nurse reviewed the
questionnaire with the patient to ensure
that all the questions were answered and
to provide prenatal education, including
the effects of substance use on the fetus.
For the questions that were left blank on
the SAQ or were answered ambiguously,
the public health nurse asked the questions and recorded the answers. A research nurse then interviewed the patients
who gave consent to participate in the
validation study. The purpose of this interview was to gather information similar
to that collected on the SAQ, but to obtain it in a face-to-face interview. The
medical] records of study participants
were also reviewed after delivery for any
alcohol-related injuries or illnesses for
which care had been received during
pregnancy.

Thirty-one Caucasian women whose
partners were American Indians were ex~
cluded from the analysis. Women were
categorized into two groups: (1) women
who did not drink during pregnancy; and
(2) women who drank during pregnancy as
determined by the self-administered questionnaire, interview, or medical record review. Women who drank during pregnancy
were subdivided into two groups: (1)
women who admitted to drinking when directly asked on the SAQ; (2) women who
stated on the SAQ that their last drink was
after their date of conception, or who were
detected during the interview or medical
record review. Binge drinking was defined
as five or more drinks per occasion (Siegel
et al., 1991).

Significant differences between the
two groups of women were determined
using a f-test for continuous variables and

Prenatal Alcohol Use

chi square for discrete variables. Fisher’s
exact text was used when comparing discrete variables when less than five events
were present. The p values less than or
equal to 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

RESULTS

Of the 177 American Indian women
who participated in the study, 44 per cent
of the women did not drink during pregnancy and 56 per cent of the women did
consume alcohol during pregnancy. Of
the women who drank during pregnancy,
23.2 per cent reported on the SAQ that
they consumed alcohol during pregnancy. An additional 32.8 per cent were
determined to have consumed alcohol
during pregnancy by their gestation and
the date of their last drink noted during
interview or medical record review. Maternal and prenatal factors were analyzed
in these two groups of women who drank
during pregnancy, and the only statistically significant difference was binge
drinking before pregnancy which was reported by 87.8 per cent of the former
group and 65.5 per cent of the latter
group (p = 0.01). For that reason, the entire group of women who drank during
pregnancy are compared to the women
who did not drink in pregnancy for all
factors except alcohol use before and
during pregnancy.

DEMOGRAPHIC AND
REPRODUCTIVE FACTORS

The women who drank during pregnancy were similar in age at delivery
(23.7 years) to the women who did not
drink (24.1 years). Women who drank alcohol during pregnancy were more likely
to be single (76.6 per cent versus 54.1 per

216

cent) and to have less education (11.2
years versus 12.1 years) than women who
did not drink during pregnancy. Most of

the women who drank alcohol had trans- 
portation available (85.7 per cent), but
they were less likely to have transportation than the women who did not drink
(94.9 per cent) (Table 1). The two groups
of women had similar reproductive histories (Table 2).

Male partners of the women who consumed alcohol during pregnancy were
more likely to have a GED and were less
likely to have a college education than
the male partners of the women who did
not drink.

SUBSTANCE USE

Alcohol use.—Most of the women in
the study (146 of 177, or 82.5 per cent)
stated on the SAQ that they drank alcohol
just before pregnancy, and 106 of the 146
women (72.6 per cent) drank five or more
drinks on an occasion. Overall, 99 of the
177 women (55.9 per cent) surveyed
were found to be drinking during pregnancy (Table 3). Almost all (95.1 per
cent) of the women had their last drink
after conception as determined by the
date of their last menstrual period.

Alcohol use during pregnancy.
Forty-one of the 99 women (41.4 per
cent) stated they drank during pregnancy
and quantitated their alcohol consumption on the self-administered questionnaire both before and during pregnancy.
Of the 41 women who quantitated their
alcohol consumption during pregnancy,
19 (46.3 per cent) reported having consumed five or more drinks on an occasion
during pregnancy. However, these 41
women significantly decreased the quantity of alcohol consumed from 7.2 drinks
per occasion before pregnancy to 4.4

Kvigne et al.

 

Social Biology

drinks per occasion during pregnancy
(p = 0.01) and frequency of alcohol consumption decreased from 2.7 times per
month before pregnancy to 1.7 times per
month during pregnancy (p = 0.007). On
occasions when more than the usual
amount of alcohol was consumed, the
quantity of alcohol consumed also decreased during pregnancy from 10.3 to
5.7 drinks (p = 0.004) and the frequency
remained unchanged.

Women who drank during pregnancy
consumed significantly more alcohol just
before pregnancy than the women who
did not consume alcohol during pregnancy but who drank prior to pregnancy.
Compared to women who did not drink
during pregnancy, women who drank
during pregnancy were more likely to report they drank more than or the same
amount as other pregnant women (p =
0.001) (Table 4).

Alcohol use before pregnancy.—The
alcohol consumption before pregnancy
was similar for the 41 women who admitted using alcohol during pregnancy and
the 58 women who did not admit to using
alcohol during pregnancy but were determined to be consuming alcohol based on
date of gestation and their last drink. Of
those who quantitated alcohol consumption prior to pregnancy, the former group
of 41 women drank 7.0 drinks per occasion, on average 2.8 times per month,
while the latter group of 58 women drank
5.8 drinks per occasion, on average 2.3
times per month (p = 0.23 for difference
in means and p = 0.34 for difference in
frequency). Binge drinking was reported
more commonly prior to pregnancy in the
former group (87.8 per cent) compared to
the latter group (65.5 per cent) (p = 0.01).

women who did not drink. Of the eight
women who used illicit drugs during pregnancy, all eight used marijuana and two
women also used speed.

Maternal risk factors —The women
who drank during pregnancy were more
likely to have parents who also drank alcohol (p = 0.003) (Table 6). Two-thirds
(65.7 per cent) of the women who drank
during pregnancy had mothers who also
drank (p = 0.003).

Women who drank during pregnancy
were more likely to be living with someone who used alcohol (p = 0.02). This
group of women experienced more physical abuse and relationship breakups (p =
0.05; p = 0.001). The women who drank
during pregnancy also experienced more
mental illness, sexual abuse, overdoses,
and suicide attempts, but these differences were not statistically significant.

The mean ages of first using alcohol
and cigarettes were similar in both groups.
The mean ages for first getting drunk and
first using marijuana were slightly older
for the women who did not drink during
pregnancy, but the differences were not
Statistically significant.

DISCUSSION

Although women between the ages of
21 and 30 have been reported to have
higher rates of alcohol use and to engage
in more binge drinking than older women
(Wilsnack et al., 1994), we found similar
mean ages of women who drink during
pregnancy and those who did not. Being
single has also been found to be a risk factor for increased alcohol use in women 21
years and older (Wilsnack et al., 1994).

Transportation for pregnant women is a
concern since public transportation is very

Prenatal Alcohol Use

219

limited in the Northern Plains. The women
who were less likely to have transportation
available did have fewer prenatal visits (7.5
vs. 9.4), but this difference was not statistically significant.

Two-thirds of the women in both groups
came into the clinic for prenatal care in the
first trimester. One contributing factor could
be the effort made by the public health
nurses and community health representatives to promote early prenatal care in this
community. In addition, providers in the
clinic consistently counseled the women in
a supportive, nonjudgmental manner so that
they would be compliant with prenatal recommendations.

Women who consumed alcohol during
pregnancy and who quantitated their alcohol
consumption on the SAQ drank more alcohol per occasion than women who drank
just before pregnancy but who did not drink
during pregnancy, which is consistent with
another study (Bnuce et al., 1993). This increased alcohol consumption may indicate
chemical dependence when women continue to drink through pregnancy. Most of
the women who drank before pregnancy
drank in binges when they drank their usual
and more than usual amount. Binge drinking was the usual pattern of drinking among
women who drank before and during pregnancy. Binge drinking may have a more
harmful effect on the fetus (Maier et al.,
1996). These women were assessed by an
intervention team and were referred for an
alcohol dependency assessment, if drinking
continued during pregnancy.

Women who drank during pregnancy
often had mothers and fathers who drank
alcohol (Table 4). More research is needed
to determine if female children of the parents who drink are more likely to drink
(Cicero, 1994).

“Information obtained postpartum from the medica! record review.

>Information obtained prenatally from the interview.

More of the women who drank during
pregnancy said they drank the same amount
or more than other pregnant women,
whereas 97.4 per cent of the women who
were not drinking during pregnancy stated
they felt they drank less than other pregnant women. It would be interesting to
know if women who drink during pregnancy are drinking with other pregnant
women, Additional research is needed in
this area.

Knowing the risk factors for women
who use alcohol during pregnancy is important for the health care providers.
Binge drinking was the only statistically
significant difference in maternal factors
in the two groups of women who drank
during pregnancy. This finding emphasizes the importance of asking the question “When was your last drink?” in determining alcohol use on the first prenatal
visit as well as determining alcohol use
on subsequent prenatal visits. Almost all
of the women (95.6 per cent) who were
drinking during pregnancy were identified by this question.

Our study was consistent with other
studies that found an association between
drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes
(Shiffman et al., 1996). Smoking rates
decreased during pregnancy for women
who drank and did not drink during pregnancy.

Risk factors for women to drink include living with someone who uses alcohol (Wilsnack et al., 1994). Over onehalf of the women who drank during
pregnancy lived with someone who drank
and approximately one-third of the
women who did not drink lived with
someone who did drink. Alcohol use in
the household seems to be a risk factor
for pregnant women.

Physical and sexual abuse are more
common among women who drink alcohol (Beckman, 1994). Alcohol is often a
coping mechanism for women who have
been sexually abused (Beckman, 1994),
Severe mental health disorders may also
be associated with alcohol abuse (Beckman, 1994). Approximately one-fourth
(28.3 per cent) of the women who drank

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

during pregnancy said they had a mental
illness compared to 16.7 per cent of the
women who did not drink (Table 6).

Programs that provide support to the
prenatal patients need to be prioritized
for women who are drinking during pregnancy. Some community prevention programs offer transportation, counseling,
prenatal classes, and parenting classes to
patients. Since nearly two-thirds of the
women who drank during pregnancy had
parents who also drank and over one-half
of the partners drank, optimal family support during the pregnancy may not be
available. To improve family support,
prevention and intervention programs
should include spouses and other family
members so that pregnant women who
are drinking have a more supportive environment in which to maintain abstinence.
It is not known how many women in this
group had prenatal alcohol exposure
themselves or what impact it may have
had on these women.

In summary, alcohol use was determined by the SAQ, interview, and medical record review. Binge drinking was
carefully assessed in this study. Although
no comparable national data exist, rates
of alcohol use, especially binge drinking,
were high in this prenatal clinic population. The question “When was your last
drink?” was the most sensitive question
in identifying women who drank alcohol
during pregnancy and should be asked at
every prenatal visit.

Women who consumed alcohol during
pregnancy drank a greater amount and
drank more frequently prior to pregnancy
than women who did not drink during
pregnancy. Smoking rates and daily cigarette consumption were higher in women
who drank during pregnancy than in
women who abstained from alcohol dur

ing pregnancy. These women experienced
more violence and may have fewer skills
to remove themselves from the cycle of
alcohol abuse. Treatment opportunities
for women and their children need to be
developed throughout the country to accommodate the needs of the women who
use substances during pregnancy.

It is important to emphasize that
drinking patterns and rates of FAS vary
considerably among various American
Indian and Alaska Native groups (May,
1996). While the prevalence of drinking
may be lower in other American Indian/
Alaska Native populations, most studies
have reported that binge drinking 1s common among the people who are currently
drinking. As the population of women
who drink reaches 40 years or older, their
alcohol consumption decreases and their
drinking pattern changes (Wilsnack et al.,
1994). More research is needed to determine how abusive drinking patterns can
be prevented and what are the most successful approaches to treatment (May,
1996).
