The Causes of the Decline in Fecundability with Age

William H. James

Galton Laboratory

London, England

 

ABSTRACT: Demographers have frequently suggested that women’s fecundability reaches a maximum some time in their twenties and thereafter remains at a plateau for some years. Recent work
by Bendel and Hua (1978) reinforces the author’s previously expressed suspicion that this theory is
incorrect. The present note is an effort to synthesize current knowledge about the variation with age
of the reproductive parameters underlying fecundability. It is suggested (1) that the major cause of
the decline in fecundability across ages 20-40 is a decline in coital rates, and (2) that a smaller part
of the decline in fecundability is caused by a rise in risk of unrecognized spontaneous abortion. It is
concluded that the “‘biological capacity to conceive’’ does not vary much during ages 20-40.

The subject of this note is fecundability, the probability of achieving a recognizable pregnancy in a month at risk (that
is, amonth of cohabitation when no form
of contraception is being used). Bendel
and Hua (1978), following earlier and less
comprehensive work on the same data
(James 1965), suggest that when fecundability is plotted against women’s age, there
is no plateau during the decade of the
twenties, but instead fecundability declines roughly linearly from ages 20-24 to
the menopause.

This finding is in marked contrast to the
beliefs and opinions of a number of demographers whom they cite. Bendel and Hua
(1978, pp. 217-218) write:

If one views fecundability as the product
of a woman’s biological capacity to conceive (potential) and her actual coital frequency, then it should be pointed out that a
linear decline of her fecundability does not
necessarily imply a linear decline of her
biological capacity to conceive. . . . Onthe
other hand if one views coital frequency and
factors other than the biological capacity as
only minor determinants of fecundability,
then a linear decline of fecundability
reflects a linear decline of biological capacity to conceive. In the future, after we be
come more certain about the relative
changes in both fecundability and coital frequency over age as wellas the latter’s role in
determining the former, we may infer more
definitively the changes in women’s purely
biological capacity to conceive.

In this note I shall offer a model suggested by our current understanding of the
parameters which underlie fecundability.
Briefly, I will argue as follows:

1. If all other relevant parameters are
equal, fecundability is roughly proportional
to coital rate.

2. Over the years 20-40, coital rate declines nearly as much as does fecundability.

3. In the absence of evidence of change
in the “‘relevant parameters” above, it may
be reasonable to suppose that the decline of
coital rate across these years is the major
determinant of the decline in fecundability.

THE MODEL

Fecundability, the probability of
achieving a recognizable pregnancy in a
month at risk may be considered as the
product of four probabilities: p,, that ovulation occurs; p,, that coitus occurs within
the fertile period; p,, that, given that
coitus has occurred in the fertile period,

330

Vol. 26, No. 4

fertilization will ensue;.and p,, that an unrecognized spontaneous abortion does not
occur.

A good deal is known about the change
of some of these parameters with age—
sufficient to enable one to draw inferences
about the probable change with age of the
product p,p,p,p, (which Bendel and Hua
call the ‘biological capacity to conceive’’).
I shall consider them in turn.

P,, THE PROBABILITY THAT OVULATION
OCCURS

The mean age at menarche is about. 13
years. About 55 per cent of all menstrual
cycles in the first menstrual year are ovulatory. For each successive year, the proportion of cycles estimated to be ovulatory increases roughly linearly until about 97 per
cent of all cycles are ovulatory at age 23.
The proportion remains roughly constant
until about age 40 when it starts declining
to about 50 per cent just before menopause (Treloar, 1974). These variations in
p, suggest that at least part of the rise of
fecundability with age before 20 is due toa
concomitant increase in p,.

In estimating the trend of fecundability
after age 20, Bendel and Hua (1978) use
data from two sources: their age-specific
fertility data are from Hutterite women
(Tietze, 1957), and their estimates of age
of onset of natural sterility are based on
Treloar’s data (1974) on menopause. But
one may wonder whether Hutterite women in general reach menopause as late as
the women in Treloar’s sample (1974).
The ground for this suspicion is as follows.
MacMahon and Worcester (1966) found a
slight negative association between age at
menopause and parity. This is odd because if the two variables were causally
unrelated, then one would expect a positive association between them simply because if (by chance) a woman were to undergo menopause early, then she could
not bear as many children as she otherwise

Decline in Fecundability 331

might have if her menopause were late.
Bearing in mind the very large number of
children borne to Hutterite women, one
might wonder whether these women reach
menopause unusually early. It is not entirely clear therefore whether fecundability is discontinuous as menopause is
reached. For this reason, the comments in
this note will be directed only at the decline of fecundability prior to age 40.

Pr THE PROBABILITY THAT COITUS OCCURS"
IN THE FERTILE PERIOD

The event of ovulation may be thought
of as contained within a stretch of time
(called the “‘fertile period”’) during which
coitus is attended with a nonzero probability of conception. This stretch of time is
equal to the sum of the durations of viability of ovum and sperm, less any time required for capacitation. Capacitation 1s
the phenomenon whereby a sperm is unable to fertilize an ovum until 1t has been in
the female reproductive tract for some
hours. Capacitation in the human being is
thought to last about 6 hours (Edwards et
al., 1969; Hembree, 1977). The fertile period in the human being has been estimated as of the order of two days (James,
1978a). If it is of this magnitude, then the
probability that coitus occurs in the fertile
period is approximately directly proportional to the coital rate (James, 1965).
And it is well established that mean marital coital rates decline roughly linearly
from age 20 to age 40, being only about
half at age 40 what they were at age 20
(Kinsey et al., 1953; Westoff and Westoff,
1971; Gorer, 1971).

P3, THE PROBABILITY OF FERTILIZATION,
GIVEN THAT COITUS HAS OCCURRED IN THE
FERTILE PERIOD

This is a parameter about which little is
known in general, let alone its possible
variation with age. However, it has been
estimated at 0.9 in the pig (Corner, 1923),

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

332 James

and a similar value has been suggested, on
tenuous evidence for the human being (James, 1970). In this context, Hertig (1967)
raises the question of whether “‘at least in
the human, the oocyte always gets into the
Fallopian tube following ovulation. . . . Itseems unlikely that so complicated a process should always work perfectly every time.’’ At this juncture, one
might note that if such high estimates of
(mean) p, are correct, then p, cannot vary
greatly with age.

Ps, THE PROBABILITY THAT UNRECOGNIZED
SPONTANEOUS ABORTION DOES NOT OCCUR

It is well established that recognized
spontaneous abortion rates are higher at
advanced maternal ages. However, interpretation of this increase is less secure.
(see Naylor, 1974, and James, 1977, for
different interpretations). But it seems
likely that sibships are heterogeneous,
some showing an increasing risk and
others a decreasing risk with age or parity
(James 19785). What can be said in respect to unrecognized spontaneous abortion? It seems that early (short gestation)
recognized spontaneous abortions are
more likely than late spontaneous abortions to be associated with chromosomal
anomaly, and in particular trisomy (Boué
et al., 1976). As such, they would be expected to be more closely associated with

_ maternal age than are later spontaneous

abortions (James, 1974). So it seems reasonable to suspect unrecognized spontaneous abortions of being positively associated with maternal age.

We are now in a position to assess how
p3 may vary with age. The facts seem to be
that (1) mean fecundability at age 40 is
about 0.4 of what it was at age 20, and (2)
mean coital rate at age 40 is about half of
what it was at age 20. Let us accept, as argued above, that in the human being the
fertile period is relatively short (say, two
days). Then fecundability is approxi
 

Social Biology

mately directly proportional to coital rate,
other parameters held constant (James,
1965). Of the two relevant parameters,
one (p,, the ovulation rate) remains
roughly constant, and the other (p,, the
complement of the unrecognized spontaneous abortion rate) almost certainly declines. So it seems that the slightly greater
decline in fecundability than in coital rate
across the age range 20-40 may be explained by the probable rise in risk of unrecognized spontaneous abortion. Thus, it
seems to follow that p, cannot vary much
across those years.

DISCUSSION

Let us consider possible ways of testing
the general suggestion made here that the
main determinant of the decline in fecundability with age is the decline in coital
rates. If this were true, then these three
propositions would allow:

1. Conception waits would be inversely
proportional to coital rates.

2. Total fertility would be slightly but
positively related to coital rate.

3. The fecundabilities of women with the
same coital rate but different ages would
not be greatly different (the difference being thought to be accastoned by an increase
with age of unrecognized spontaneous
abortion rates).

These propositions will be considered in
turn.

Proposition 1.—The first proposition
here is strongly supported by the data of
Stix (1939), MacLeod and Gold (1953),
and Westoff et al. (1963). Ryder and
Westoff’s (1971) data give moderate support to the proposition, and these authors
were clearly surprised (p. 339) at the finding because they related current estimated
coital rate to the conception waits through
the entire reproductive histories of the respondents (some occurring twenty years
previous). Workers finding a weaker (but
still negative) association between coital

Vol. 26, No. 4

rate and conception wait were Stix and
Notestein (1940) and Cartwright (1976).

In summary, all the data on this point
are agreed that there is an association between coital rate and conception wait.
Bearing in mind the very great imprecision in one of these variables (coital rate
estimated for periods up to twenty years
previous), we find it reasonable to infer
that the true relationship between these
variables is strong.

Proposition 2.—Sheps and Perrin
(1964) have shown that the mean birth interval B is given by

-A[ Sion +

1=1]

where 8,, 8,, and 6, are the probabilities
that a conception will result in a spontaneous abortion, a stillbirth, and a live birth,
respectively; and ‘n, n and 7 are the means
of the intervals during which a woman is
not at risk of further conception (i.e., the
gestation period plus the period of postpartum sterility) for a spontaneous abortion, a stillbirth, and a live birth, respectively; and p is harmonic mean fecundability.
If, following James (1965), we put

4
>On

at 13 months, then harmonic mean fecundabilities of 0.5 and 0.1 (a five-fold
change) would be associated respectively
with birth intervals in the ratio of 14 and
22. Since fertility is proportional to the reciprocal of birth intervals, it follows that in
conditions of natural fertility, couples
whose harmonic mean fecundability is 0.1
would be expected to have about twothirds as many children as those whose
harmonic mean fecundability was 0.5.
Thus, even if variation in fecundability
were entirely dependent on variation in
coital rate, one would only expect a slight

Decline in Fecundability 333

association between coital rate and fertility. Nevertheless, two sets of data testify
to such an association (Thompson and Illsley, 1969; James, 1974b). Thus, the evidence for this proposition ts good also.

Proposition 3.—This proposition is
supported by the data of Barrett (1971)
who suggested that the fecundability of
women over 30 is 70 per cent that of women less than 30 when coital rate is controlled. Moreover, this proposition is supported by a consideration of the Hutterite
data presented by Sheps (1965). Her
analysis shows that Hutterite cumulative
duration-specific birth rates over the first
ten years of marriage are almost identical
for women married at ages 25-29, and at
ages 20-24, and at ages less than 20. I have
unpublished data suggesting that coital rates (over the first years of marriage) are
much more closely related to duration of
marriage than to age. The inference is that
these various classes of women, though
they have different ages, have closely similar coital rates. And the fact that their fertilities (and hence fecundabilities) are
equal strongly suggests that it is coital rate
and not age per se which is responsible for
the overall decline in fecundability with
age.

The question arises: Would these propositions be true if coital rate were not a
major determinant of fecundability? The
third proposition would not be true, so no
further discussion is required on that
point. What of the first two? In principle
they would be true, but in practice it seems
that their truth would have remained undetected. As argued above, the relationship between fecundability and fertility is
tenuous even in noncontracepting societies. Moreover, the relationship between one component of fecundability
(coital rate) and fertility must be more
tenuous still, and all the more so when that
component is the subject of serious errors
of measurement. The fact that these assoDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

ciations (between coital rate on the one
hand, and conception waits and fertility
on the other) have nevertheless been detected indicates that coital rate is a major
determinant of fecundability.
