Endocrinological studies of the time
to the first ovulatory cycle in early and
late maturing girls in Finland (Apter and
Vihko, 1983) are contrary to the Bangladeshi results reported by Foster et al. in
their article in Social Biology (1986)
33:183-—198. Apter et al. found that the
frequency of ovulation depended significantly on both the time since menarche
and the age at menarche (p < 0.001 for
both variables). Early menarche was associated with early onset of ovulatory
cycles. The times from menarche until
50 per cent of the cycles were ovulatory
were about 1 year, 3 years, and 4.5
years, when the ages at menarche were
less than 12.0 years, 12.0-12.9 years,
and more than or equal to 13.0 years, respectively. These authors also found
that Quetelet’s index of adiposity was
highest in the early maturing group.

It would be interesting to know why
the Bangladesh data differ from the
definitive data of Apter and Vihko
(1983) and the earlier data of Halewijn
and DeWaard (1968), which Foster et
al. cite. In any case, the data from
Bangladesh are puzzling, and their use
in fertility models is problematic.

Also, two corrections are necessary
on the use of the fatness index in the

 

Foster et al. paper. First the MellitsCheek equation for predicting body water is based on direct measurements of
body water in American females. This
equation cannot be used to estimate
body water, and hence lean body weight
and fat for other racial groups. Direct
measurements of body water of Bangladeshi girls are necessary to estimate
their body water from their height and
weight.

Second, the equation given by Foster
et al. in Footnote e in Table 1 does not
quantify fat and is not the fatness index
of Frisch et al., 1973. The fatness index
described in Frisch et al, 1973, and later
papers (Frisch and McArthur, 1974;
Frisch, 1980; Frisch, 1985) is total water
as per cent of body weight (TW/
BWt%). Fat/body weight per cent is inverse to TW/BWt% since fat has little
water. To estimate total water as per
cent of body weight from the MellitsCheek equation, body water is estimated:

(1) TBW (liters) = -10.313 + 0.252 wt
(kg) + 0.154ht (cm), and divided by
the body weight of the subject.
Then, to estimate fat (kg):
since TBW is 72% of the lean body
mass (LBM):

(2) LBM (kg) = TBW/0.72
(3) Fat (kg) = Body weight (kg) -LBM
k

(kg).
(4) Fat/Body weight per cent = 100
((TBW/BWt %)/0.72].

These equations give physiologically
meaningful numbers, which can be
checked with corpse dissections and
other direct body composition measure

should be noted that prediction of the
threshold body weight for height for
menarche and regular cycles (Frisch and
McArthur, 1974), which is now widely
used clinically to evaluate and treat nutritional amenorrhea (Nillius, 1983), is
from TW/BWt%, not fat/body weight
per cent, (Frisch, 1985).
