In the paper by J. E. Veevers, “Factors
in the Incidence of Childlessness in Canada:
An Analysis of Census Data” (Volume 19,
No. 3, September, 1972, p. 266-274), there
are two quotations on p. 267 and 268 that
may mislead some readers. The first is
from Thomlinson (Population Dynamics,
1965, page 148, rather than page 48 as
stated in Veevers’ paper) which states that
in the United States about one-third of all
couples appear to be subfecund and approximately 10% are definitely sterile, “that
is, they seem totally incapable of having
children.” This statement was based on the
1955 Growth of American Families Study,
a sample survey of U.S. white married
women 18-39 years of age. The 10% classified as definitely sterile could not have
children in the future, but many of them
had borne children in the past. The fact
that the category “definitely sterile” refers
to the future rather than the past inability
to have children was not clear in the
Thomlinson quotation nor in the Veevers
paper, although it was clear in the original
source of this statistic.

On page 268 of the paper by Veevers the
following quotation is cited from Fertility
and Family Planning in the United States
(1966) by Whelpton, Campbell, and Pat
terson, page 163: “If fecundity impairments
had been the sole cause of childlessness, the
proportion of couples with no children
would have been between nine and thirteen
percent.” In the source, this sentence refers
to a 1941 sample of Protestant white
couples who had been married 12 to 14
years living in Indianapolis. In the context
of the Veevers paper, which does not describe the population to which the data
relate, the quotation might be misinterpreted as referring to the U.S. population
of childbearing age in 1960, which was
reported in the book from which the quotation was taken. In discussing trends in
childlessness in the U.S. population, the
book noted (page 164), “We may consider
8 percent as an upper limit on the prevalence of childlessness that will be achieved
by white couples in the United States. The
actual proportion will probably be lower
but we can only speculate about how much
lower.” The book goes on to cite very low
proportions childless (2-5%) in various
noncontracepting populations. The main
point I wish to make is that the authors of
this book did not think that the proportions
of 9% to 13% childless due to subfecundity
found in the Indianapolis Study was applicable to a contemporary U.S. population.
