Neurophysiological Mechanisms in the
Genetics of Ethanol Sensitivity

ABSTRACT: Cerebellar Purkinje neurons of long-sleep (LS) mice express a higher sensitivity
than do those of short-sleep (SS) mice to the depressant effects of ethanol in situ, in vitro, and in
intraocular cerebellar brain grafts. The ethanol sensitivity of Purkinje neurons is intrinsic to the
cerebellum, may be associated with only certain brain areas, and shows a high genetic correlation with the behavioral sensitivity of mice to ethanol-induced ataxia. Tolerance develops to the
depressant effects of ethanol on cerebellar neurons in both lines of mice. However, ethanoltolerant LS mice are more sensitive to the electrophysiological effects of ethanol on Purkinje
neurons than are ethanol-tolerant SS mice. In addition, the behavioral sensitivity to this drug
probably also involves noncerebellar neurons since neonatally cerebellectomized LS and SS

mice retain a different sensitivity to the'‘ataxic effects of ethanol.

The development of long-sleep (LS)
and short-sleep (SS) mouse lines which
differ markedly in their ataxic responses
to acute ethanol administration (McClearn et al., 1970; Heston et al., 1973,
1974) offered a unique opportunity to
study the relationship between neurophysiological and behavioral effects of
this drug. These authors found that the
loss of righting response to a given dose
of ethanol is over an order of magnitude
longer in LS mice than in SS mice
(Erwin, this volume). Previous neurophysiological investigations implicate
the cerebellum as one target brain area
in the acute central nervous system effects of systemically administered ethanol (Eidelberg et al., 1971; Kaland,
1974; Klemm and Stevens, 1974; Wayner et al., 1975; Mitra; 1977; Grupp and
Perlanski, 1979; Rogers et al., 1980; Sin
clair and Lo, 1980, 1981). Similarly, ethanol alters the firing rates of cerebellar
Purkinje cells in rats when applied locally by micro pressure-ejection and
electroosmosis in situ (Siggins and
French, 1979; Siggins and Bloom,
1980).

Consistent with these studies, we
found that the firing rates of single cerebellar Purkinje neurons (a measure of
information output from these brain
cells) from both LS and SS mice are
slowed by the micro pressure-ejection
application of ethanol from the second
barrel of two-barrel micropipettes
(Palmer et al., 1980) used to record electrical activity from these cells (Sorensen
et al., 1980). Correlating with the differential behavioral responsiveness of
these two mouse lines, this depression of
spontaneous Purkinje neuron discharge

doses of ethanol which are 30-fold lower
in LS mice than in SS mice (Fig. 1).

for LS and SS mice. This differential

negatively sloping (downward) part of the waveform with the roughly 5 msec latency to onset is the population spike. This spike represents the simultaneous firing of a population of pyramidal neurons in the
vicinity of the electrode in response to stimulation of the afferent pathway. The size of the spike represents the number of neurons responding to the stimulation. There were no significant differences in the
effects of ethanol for decreasing population spike size between LS and SS mice. (From Sorensen et al.,

1980; Siggins and Bloom, 1980; Sinclair
and Lo, 1980, 1981). On the other hand,
a direct action of ethanol in the cerebellum is evident from the work of Forney

experiments described above probably
directly affects cerebellar neurons in the
vicinity of the pipette tip. However, ethanol applied by this method might also

alter the activity of nearby nerve terminals from other brain areas. Previous investigations illustrate that ethanol’s effects on input pathways to the
cerebellum may mediate some of the
changes in Purkinje neuron firing rates
caused by systemic administration of
this depressant drug (Rogers et al.,

and Klemm (1976) who reported that
the electrophysiological effects of systemic ethanol persist in cerebella which
have been surgically isolated from the
rest of the brain. In addition, ethanol
perfused in vitro alters the firing rates of
neurons in explants of cerebellum (Seil
etal., 1977).

We sought to determine if the ethanol sensitivity of Purkinje neurons could
be maintained by intraocular brain
grafts of LS and SS cerebella (Palmer et
al., 1982). For this preparation, cerebellar buds were obtained from 11- to 12day fetuses of LS and SS mice and were
homologously transplanted into the anterior eye chamber of adult mice (Olson
and Malmfors, 1970; Olson et al., 1983),
where they were allowed to mature
prior to physiological investigations
(Hoffer et al., 1974). Fetal cerebellar
tissue was transplanted both within and
between mouse lines. The cerebellar
grafts attached to the anterior surface of
the iris and developed a trilaminar organization typical of the in situ cerebellum
(Palmer et al., 1982). We observed
dose-dependent depressions of Purkinje
neuron firing rates with ethanol perfusion of in oculo cerebellar grafts derived
from both LS and SS mice (Fig. 4).
Purkinje neurons from LS grafts were
about an order of magnitude more sensitive to the depressant effects of perfused ethanol than were Purkinje cells
from SS grafts (Fig. 5).

Since the in oculo transplants do not
receive nerve terminals from the central
nervous system (CNS), the observed
ethanol sensitivity difference could not
be due to alterations of central afferent
nerve fibers. However, effects of ethanol on axons from the host iris, which
are known to innervate cerebellar grafts
in oculo (Taylor et al., 1980), cannot be
ruled out. We also found that the ethanol sensitivity of Purkinje cells is not altered in cerebellar grafts transplanted
between mouse lines (Fig. 5). Thus,
Purkinje neurons in grafts derived from
LS fetal brain and transplanted to SS
host mice exhibited ethanol sensitivities
(Fig. 6) similar to that of neurons from
LS cerebellum transplanted to LS host

mice (Fig. 4). Likewise, the ethanol sensitivities of Purkinje neurons from SS
transplants were similar regardless of
whether transplanted to LS or SS host
mice. Since the LS and SS transplants
maintain the ethanol sensitivity of the
mouse line from which they were derived, the depressant effects of ethanol
on grafted cerebella do not appear to be
markedly influenced by the humoral
and neuronal influences of the host
mouse line. Thus, the data from the cerebellar transplants suggest that factors
intrinsic to the cerebellum determine
the different ethanol sensitivities of cerebellar Purkinje neurons observed in LS
and SS mice.

Consistent with this hypothesis that
genotypic differences between Purkinje
neurons from LS and SS lines of mice
determine the cerebellar ethanol sensitivities of these animals, Basile and collaborators (1983) have reported that
Purkinje neurons from slices of LS cerebella are 5-fold more sensitive to the depressant effects of ethanol perfused in
vitro than are neurons from slices of SS
cerebella (Fig. 7). Similar to the in situ
data, the ethanol sensitivity of HS
Purkinje neurons is intermediate between that of LS and SS cerebellar
slices. Since many of the afferents to the
cerebellum have been truncated from
their cell bodies in the preparation of the
in vitro cerebellar slice, there is little if
any spontaneous synaptic activity in this
preparation. Thus, although the longterm modulation of Purkinje cell responsiveness to ethanol by neuronal inputs to the cerebellum cannot be
discounted from these experiments, the
physiological effects of ethanol found
during this in vitro study may reflect direct actions of ethanol in the cerebellum.

demonstrate that tolerance to the depressant effects of ethanol applied by
micro pressure-ejection to in situ cerebellum and by perfusion of in vitro cerebellar slices develops in both LS and SS
mice (Palmer et al., 1985). In these studies, mice were chronically fed ethanol in
liquid diets for one to four weeks. For
both lines of mice, higher doses of ethanol were required to depress Purkinje
neuron activity in situ and in vitro in tolerant mice as compared to pair-fed controls. It was concluded that the degree of

 

tolerance developed to the electrophysiological effects of ethanol on single cerebellar neurons both in situ and in vitro is
equivalent and parallels the occurrence
of behavioral tolerance to ethanol in LS
and SS mice. However, ethanol-tolerant
LS mice remain significantly more sensitive than ethanol-tolerant SS mice, indicating that the differential sensitivity to
acute ethanol applications persists in the
tolerant animals.

the behavioral ataxic effects of ethanol,
documented by the studies described
above, supports the hypothesis that the
ethanol sensitivities of certain areas of
the central neuron system (CNS) may
mediate the behavioral responses to this
drug. However, it is also possible that
this association of behavioral and neurophysiological phenotypic differences in
the LS and SS mice may be due to happenstance; perhaps this phenomenon is
related to the occurrence of genetic drift
or inbreeding during the selection experiments.

To test the hypothesis of a genetic
correlation of the two phenotypes, we
compared the phenotypic differences in
behavioral and neurophysiological responses to acute ethanol administration
among the eight inbred mouse strains
used to develop the HS mice (Spuhler et
al., 1982). In these experiments, the estimates of genetic variation in ethanolinduced behavioral ataxia, as measured

bution. This, however, is consistent with
the fact that the selected lines have been
bred at least twenty generations for a
specific combination of gene complexes
that express the extreme phenotypic responses in ethanol sensitivity. The inbred strains, on the other hand, have
had no selection pressure applied for
ethanol’s effects during their breeding
histories. Indeed, the observed distribution of ethanol sensitivities might be expected for the inbred strains if the
fixation of gene complexes for ethanol

sensitivity within the strains during their
development was a chance event, consistent with random genetic drift.

From the analysis of covariance, the
estimate of genetic correlation of ethanol sleep time and Purkinje neuron ethanol sensitivity was quite high; this suggests that either common genes or
closely linked genes influence both behavioral and neuronal sensitivities to
this depressant agent. Further experiments, using recombinant inbred strains

the genetic correlation of behavioral
and neuronal ethanol sensitivities is not
as high in rats as in mice (Spuhler et al.,
1984). This appears to be due to differences in ethanol clearance rates playing
a greater role in determining the behav
ioral sensitivity to ethanol in rats than in
mice. However, it is apparent that the
variation in expression of behavioral
sensitivity to ethanol is under polygenic
control. Even so, the consistent relationship of Purkinje neuron sensitivity
and behavioral sensitivity to ethanol
suggests that major genes regulate the

ethanol sensitivity of certain areas of the
CNS which, in turn, influence behavioral responsiveness to this depressant
drug.

More recently, we have studied the
ability of the cerebellum to regulate ethanol sensitivity by investigating the
ethanol-induced sleep times of LS and
SS mice from which the cerebellar brain
area had been removed (Palmer et al.,
1984). Mice of both lines were cerebe]lectomized within ten days of birth, and
behavioral testing was performed sev
eral weeks later. Postmortem investigations showed that the degree of cerebellectomy of animals from both lines
ranged from 0 to 100 per cent. These observations agreed well for any one animal with the results of tests for cerebellar deficiency-induced ataxia that were
administered prior to the ethanol sleeptime tests. Even the most severely ataxic
animals, however, were able to show a
righting response.

The results indicate that neonatal
cerebellectomy caused SS mice to be

come more Sensitive to the ataxic effects
of ethanol, while the sleep times of LS
mice were essentially unchanged by this
surgical treatment (Fig. 10). Furthermore, the ethanol-induced sleep times
of cerebellectomized LS mice were
four- to five-fold longer than those observed for cerebellectomized SS mice.
While the proposed explanations for
these results are complex, it can be reasonably concluded that cerebellar
Purkinje neurons are not the only neuronal elements involved in determining
the sensitivity of LS and SS mice to the
ataxic effects of ethanol. It is possible
that neonatal brainstem plasticity is responsible for some recovery of function
lost with the cerebellar removal. Even
so, these data might suggest that populations of neurons in other brain areas
could also express the differential sensitivity to the depressant effects of ethanol

in LS and SS mice that we originally described for cerebellar Purkinje neurons.

It is obvious from the work of Sorensen and colleagues (1981) that at least
some neurons do not show this differential ethanol sensitivity. However, the regional distribution of CNS neurons
which are differentially sensitive is currently unknown. It is quite possible that,
in addition to the role played by cerebellar Purkinje neurons in regulating behavioral ethanol sensitivities, differentially ethanol-sensitive neurons outside
of the cerebellum are directly involved
in regulating the righting response.
However, the existence and significance
of these neurons will require further investigation.

In conclusion, groups of neurons
have been described in the cerebellum
of LS and SS mice which show sensitivities to locally applied ethanol that are

consistent with the sensitivity of these
animals to the ataxic effects of this drug.
This ethanol sensitivity is not found in
all brain areas, and the expression of this
phenotype by Purkinje neurons is an intrinsic property of the cerebellum.
There is, indeed, a high genetic correlation between the behavioral responsiveness and the physiological Purkinje neuron responsiveness to ethanol among
inbred mouse strains. However, noncerebellar groups of neurons are proba

bly also important in mediating the differential ethanol sensitivity of LS and SS
mice to the ataxic effects of this depressant agent.
