Hereditary Genius: A Centennial Problem
in Resolution of Cultural and Biological Inheritance

ABSTRACT: Galton believed that his data on hereditary genius support purely genetic inheritance.
On the contrary, analysis under a simple model shows no clear resolution of genetic and cultural
inheritance in this material, or generally, unless adoptive relations, monozygous twins, and/or environmental indices are included in a design adequate to test the assumptions under which they are

informative.

The publication of Hereditary Genius
(Galton, 1869) was greeted enthusiastically by a generation that ignored Mendel.
Charles Darwin wrote to the author, his
cousin Francis Galton, “I do not think that
Tever in all my life read anything more interesting and original,”

A century later Galton is remembered
as a pioneer in statistics and human
genetics, but the reputation of Hereditary
Genius has declined. This is partly due to
dissatisfaction with the phenotype as an
object of genetic study, but the more important factor has been reluctance to accept Galton’s postulate that family environment is a negligible cause of family
resemblance.

Our interest in these data is not to rehabilitate them, but to ask a general question: Could data of this type, collected for
a suitable trait under impeccable standards, resolve cultural and biological inheritance? The answer has important implications for genetic epidemiology and
behavior genetics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Galton defined a genius as ‘“‘a man endowed with superior faculties.”” About

48

250 such men are found per million adult
males. To diagnose genius he relied on
reputation as reflected by select biographical dictionaries. Starting with 951
probands of various kinds (judges, statesmen, commanders, literati, scientists,
poets, artists, and divines), he tabulated
how many of their male relatives of each
degree were also eminent. We shall not labor the ascertainment and diagnostic
problems in this endeavor, except to note
that the number of undistinguished relatives could not be determined. As the reference population is limited to adult
males, we assume that on the average each
proband has one classifiable son, two uncles, two grandsons, and so on. Familial
resemblance is strikingly manifest (Table
1). Heterogeneity between reciprocal relatives is significant, reflecting uncertainty
in number of relatives at risk and perhaps
variable ascertainment. We take the mean
square among replicates as error (19.43/5
= 3.89).

Further analysis is based on a simple
linear model for the continuous liability
scale underlying ‘“‘eminence”’ (Figure 1).
The phenotype on that scale is the sum of
contributions from genotype (G), transmissible environment (C), and random

hoods are obtained under a purely cultural
model if assortative mating is based on social stratification with a correlation u between transmissible parental environments). Since eminence is judged
posthumously or in old age, intergenerational differences are not assumed for
genetic heritability (h?) or cultural heritability (c?). Because Galton did not define
his phenotype in females, we cannot discriminate maternal effects by distinguishing the paths from father’s and mother’s
transmissible environments. This model
in four parameters (Table 2) is a special
case of a more general path model (Rao et
al., 1979).

Here we must fit this scheme not to
quantitative phenotypes, for which it was
developed, but to the dichotomy of eminent vs. undistinguished, where the frequencies are functions of the tetrachoric
correlation on the primary liability scale
(Kendall, 1973). Goodness-of-fit of the
observed frequencies (”,) among various
relatives to those expected (#i,) under the
linear model is measured by the likelihood
ratio test

x= 22nj In (7)

where the summation is taken over eminent as well as undistinguished categories
of all types of relatives fitted. This residual
x? would be used to test hypotheses if homogeneity among replicates were tenable.
However, since total heterogeneity between reciprocal relatives (fathers and
sons, etc.) is significant, we perform tests
of hypotheses in terms of F-ratios:

x2/k
3.89

where k is the degrees of freedom for x2.
Theoretical details of the method are
given elsewhere (Rao et al., 1979).

The results show that cultural and genetic inheritance are not well resolved (Table

F(k,5) =

Social Biology

3). The highest likelihood (smallest X2) is
given by pure cultural inheritance, but the
fit is not signficantly better than for pure
genetic inheritance:

_ 66.25 — 54.32 _

1.53.
* 2(3.89)

In fact, fixing h at a high value of 0.7 leads
to only slight increase in the X?. By a X?
test, ignoring significant heterogeneity
among reciprocal relatives, the hypothesis
of pure genetic inheritance is excluded
(X? = 66.25 — 54.32 = 11.93), but the hypothesis of pure cultural inheritance is not
(x? = 54.32 — 54.32 = 0.00). However,
this test is hardly appropriate. When f=%
the two kinds of inheritance are completely confounded and all values of h
from 0 to 1 give X2 = 66.25. Therefore, the
suggestively better fit of the purely
cultural model is entirely due to excess of f
over 1/2. Goodness-of-fit of the cultural
model is presented in Table 4. The best
generalized single locus model under random mating gives X? = 370.78 for no dominance. The fit is much poorer than for a
polygenic model, which accommodates
high recurrence in relatives through assortative mating.

Ascertainment of eminent remote relatives is incomplete and the estimate of
their number unreliable. When the
“great” relatives are excluded on this account, estimates are virtually unchanged
and there is no resolution of genetic and
cultural inheritance even by the X? test
(Table 3).

The conclusions with respect to
Galton’s data are clear. He was misled by
hereditarian prejudice and lack of a quantitative theory into imputing evidence
where virtually none was available. The
direction of the evidence slightly favors
pure cultural inheritance. If he were alive
today, he would have occasion to reaffirm
his great dictum which appears on the inside cover of Annals of Human Genetics:

General impressions are never to be
trusted. Unfortunately when they are of
long standing they become fixed rules of life
and assume a prescriptive right not to be
questioned. Consequently those who are
not accustomed to original inquiry entertain a hatred and a horror of statistics. They
cannot endure the idea of submitting their
sacred impressions to cold-blooded
verification. But it is the triumph of
scientific men to rise superior to such superstitions, to desire tests by which the value of
beliefs may be ascertained, and to feel
sufficiently masters of themselves to discard
contemptuously whatever may be found
untrue.

hereditary genius is not the anecdotal one
of proving indeterminacy in a particular
case. No data can resolve genetic and
cultural inheritance (by testing the subhypothesesh = Oandc = 0) unless: (1) relatives are included which vary one component while the other is held constant, or
(2) the relevant environment is estimated
by an index.

Of critical relationships monozygous
twins have complete genetic identity, with
an environmental covariance that for
some traits and populations may be no
greater than for sibs. This may be tested
indirectly by fitting a simple model to
several relationships including dizygous
twins. The children of monozygous twins
are also informative, under assumptions
about environmental covariance that must
be tested. The model of Figure 1 and its
generalization give logically consistent expectations in terms of the same parameters (h, c, f, p, etc.) as nuclear families and
other common relationships (Rao et al.,
1979)

So far environmental indices have been
applied with success to quantitative data,
but even the theory has not been implemented for qualitative traits (Rao et al.,
1979; Rao et al., 1979). The intercorrelations of indices and phenotypes give many
residual degrees of freedom for testing assumptions, even in nuclear families. For
resolution, the index must be a good

measure of relevant environment but is
not required to be excellent, i.e., the path
coefficient from environment to index
should not approach zero, but need not
approach unity.

Investigators in genetic epidemiology
and behavior genetics should be aware
that collection and publication of data on
common relationships without indices are
of limited value, since they cannot resolve
cultural and biological inheritance. Most

larly flawed. While they lead to no appreciable error for common relationships
whether inheritance is genetic or not, their
validity for adopted children, half-sibs,
and other uncommon relationships is
questionable.
