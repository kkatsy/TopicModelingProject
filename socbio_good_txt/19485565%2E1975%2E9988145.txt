Analysis of Genetic and Environmental
Sources of Variation in Serum Cholesterol
in Tecumseh, Michigan: II. The Role of '
Education, Occupation, and Income

ical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan

The level of serum cholesterol has been
shown to be one of the factors most highly
associated with the incidence of coronary
heart disease (CHD). Truitt et al. (1967)
have shown that in the Framingham study
serum cholesterol ranks second to the number of cigarettes smoked and systolic blood
pressure as an indicator of risk for CHD.
Many other studies have provided additional documentation that one or more of
these factors may be useful as an indicator
of risk for CHD (for a review see Epstein
and Kjelsberg, 1965).

This paper is the second in a series devoted to an attempt to determine the
genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the prediction of the level of
serum cholesterol, based on data compiled
in the Tecumseh Community Health Study
from 1959 to 1970. In the first paper (Sing
et al., 1975), one or two serum cholesterol
measurements taken on each of 4,730 females and 4,619 males were analyzed for
the effect of a polymorphic locus (with a
major effect) on the frequency distribution
of observations. After the serum cholesterol
values were transformed by the natural
logarithm (In), adjusting them for age,

period of exam, and replicate reduced the
total variation in the data 36 per cent for
males and 39 per cent for females. The evidence from the adjusted values for a second
mode of hypercholesterolemic individuals
suggests that the frequency of a hypothesized dominant allele at a single locus
which determines hypercholesterolemia is
rare in this population.

The purpose of this paper is to examine
the adjusted In-cholesterol values to determine if there is a2 random distribution
of serum cholesterol levels among education, occupation, and income classes and,
if not, to estimate the degree to which these
measures of socioeconomic status explain
the natural variation of serum cholesterol
in the Tecumseh community. Adjustment
of an individual’s value for such effects can
then result in a more precise analysis of the
genetic effects that may contribute to differences among individuals.

There have been a number of studies investigating the relationship between serum
cholesterol and one or two of these socioeconomic indicators using data which represented specific age groups. No study of
an unselected population which simultane

ously considers all three of these measures
of socioeconomic standing for the wide
range of ages represented in the Tecumseh
sample (4-92) has been reported.

The results of previous studies have been
varied. Marks (1967) summarizes quite
well the work published up to 1967 pertaining to socioeconomic effects. The relevant
findings may be stated briefly. In a study
of 1,400 Chicago blacks (Berkson et al.,
1960), no statistically significant difference
in serum cholesterol levels between bluecollar and white-collar workers was found.
Similarly, in a Chicago utility company
study (Berkson et al., 1960) and in a survey of railroad employees (Taylor et al.,
1966) in the northwest and midwestern
United States, serum cholesterol level was
not found to be statistically related to an
occupational identification.

In contrast, a number of investigations
have provided data supporting a relationship between some measure of socioeconomic status and serum cholesterol. A
comparison of 147 officers and 121 enlisted
men in the Chinese army, aged 30 to 59,
(Alexander et al., 1965) showed the officers
to have significantly greater serum cholesterol levels. Evaluation of data collected
from 288 Guatemalan male and female
school children, aged 7 to 12, showed that
children of higher income parents had
higher serum cholesterol than children of
lower income parents (Scrimshaw et al.,
1965). Studies of 75 healthy individuals
and 75 coronary cases (Chattopadhaya et
al., 1966) and 363 males (Mathur et al.,
1959) in India found that serum cholesterol
increased with the increase in socioeconomic
status. An investigation by Komachi et al.
(1971) of 8,587 Japanese males, aged 40
to 69, observed that urban executives and
physicians had higher average serum cholesterol and greater incidence of hypercholesterolemia than urban manual or clerical
workers or rural and semi-rural inhabitants.

Variation in Serum Cholesterol

35

Other research has turned up different
relationships between indicators of socioeconomic status and serum cholesterol in
different age groups. In Evans County,
Georgia, white males in “high” social classes
had significantly greater serum cholesterol
than those in “low” social classes after age
45 but not before (McDonough et al,
1965). White-collar workers in New ZeaJand had higher serum cholesterol before
age 40 than industrial workers but not
after (Hunter, 1963). Glazunov et al.
(1964) found that a sample of Moscow
clerks had higher serum cholesterol than
factory workers for those 50 to 59 years
old but not for those 40:to 49 years old;
and a comparison by Pell and D’Alonzo
(1961) of 1,585 “top” executives, “lower”
executives, and white-collar nonexecutives
of duPont in Delaware showed that serum
cholesterol increased with position for those
subjects between 40 and 49 years of age,
while there was no significant difference in
serum cholesterol between the three groups
for those subjects aged 50 to 64.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

From 1959 to 1970 the Tecumseh Community Health Study collected data with
the intent of defining predictors of health
and disease in a total community. Our data
set comes from this study. It consists of
14,310 serum cholesterol observations, representing one or two measurements on each
of 4,619 males and 4,730 females. Age was
recorded with each observation. Occupation, educational class, and the income of
the family unit within which an individual
resided were also recorded. Individuals who
had a cholesterol measurement but who did
not have one of the socioeconomic variables recorded were placed in a separate
category (Table 1) for that variable. These
data were collected in two “rounds,” the
first from 1959 to 1960 and the second from
1963 to 1966. Serum cholesterol was deDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

termined in both rounds for 2,457 males
and 2,504 females, while the remaining individuals had a measurement in only one
round. Serum cholesterol was determined
in both rounds by the procedure of Abell
et al. (1952).

It was established by Sing et al. (1975)
that the most reasonable method of dealing
with the serum cholesterol data was to take
the natural logarithm of each observation.
Then, for each sex and round separately,
In-cholesterol was fit to age (measured in
months) by a third-order polynomial; after
that, each In-cholesterol value was adjusted for age by the appropriate polynomial]. If a person was measured in only
one round, this measurement became his
adjusted In-cholesterol value; if he was
measured in both rounds, the two values
obtained were averaged to arrive at his final
adjusted value.

The socioeconomic variables considered
here were obtained by interview. They are:
(1) combined income of all members, 18 or
more years of age, of the respondent’s
family living in the same household in the
twelve months prior to the interview; (2)
the respondent’s occupation; and (3) the
highest level of education that he attained
if he was 18 years of age or older. The
codes for and the numbers of individuals in
each of the classes for each of these three
variables are given in Table 1. Whenever
an individual’s occupation, his educational
class, or the income of his family unit were

not available, he was assigned to a “not
available” class. Individuals who were under 18 years of age were considered to
belong to a separate educational class. If
an individual participated in both rounds,
he was assigned for each socioeconomic
variable the code for Round IT, unless his
code in Round II was “not available,”
in which case he was assigned his code for
Round I.

Having ascertained the values of the
variables of interest for all subjects, we
examined by amalysis-of-variance techniques the adjusted In-cholesterol values
for variation attributable to different classes
of education, occupation, and income. Due
to the unbalanced structure of the problem
(number of observations in each combination of the three indicators not being
equal), it was not feasible to examine all
three socioeconomic variables  simultaneously in a three-way analysis.

To examine the variation removed from
the data by accounting for the combination
of education, occupation, and income, we
followed a sequential analysis of variance
procedure. On the basis of the analysis of
In-cholesterol completed on education, each
person’s adjusted In-cholesterol value was
readjusted by subtracting from it the “effect” (deviation of the class mean Incholesterol from the grand mean of all
In-cholesterol values) of his education
class; and another analysis of variance was
done on occupation using these newly-adjusted In-cholesterol values. Similarly, an
adjustment was made for occupation followed by an analysis of variance of the new
values on income. In this way, a test for the
effect of all three socioeconomic indicators
taken together on serum cholesterol variation can be made on the basis of a “socioeconomic status sum of squares,” which is
the sum of three sums of squares: those
accountable by differences (1) among education classes, (2) among occupation classes

after adjustment for education, and (3)
among income classes after adjustment for
education and occupation.

In addition, one-way analyses of variance
of In-cholesterol were carried out separately on education, occupation, and income
variables. In these analyses, we estimated
the mean values of each class for a variable,
ignoring the other two variables, and considered the F-statistic as a test of the hypotheses of equality of the class means.
We also searched for possible interactions
between pairs of the socioeconomic variables. To measure and test for an effect of
interaction between education and occupation on serum cholesterol, for example, we
considered the difference between the sum
of squares among education classes within
occupation classes and the sum of squares
among education classes over all the data,
ignoring the occupation class designation.
At the same time, we examined the F-tests
and effects for the conditional (as described
in the previous paragraph) analyses of
variance.

RESULTS

Tables 2 and 3 present evidence that
variation in serum cholesterol may be related to socioeconomic status (as indicated
by class of education, occupation, and income taken together) in males but not in
females. The test for effects of socioeconomic status is significant at the 0.001 level
for males (Part A in Table 2), but it is
not significant at 0.10 for females (Part A
in Table 3). However, an assumption on
which the test is based is violated and must
be considered to evaluate this outcome
properly. Since some subjects were measured in two rounds and the others only in
ohne round, the error variances of the Incholesterol measurements considered in
Part A in Tables 2 and 3 are not the same
for each individual. Because of this fact,
our estimates of error variance (and hence,

result is an F-statistic which may be unreliable as a test for the null hypothesis of
no socioeconomic status effect. To get some
measure of what this bias might be, we
analyzed each round of data separately. In
this case, the “residual”’ observation variances are all based on one measurement
and the F-statistic will not be subject to
the aforementioned bias.

The results for each round are presented
in Part B in Tables 2 and 3 for comparison
with the analysis of the pooled data. In
each round, for males, the test of the socioeconomic status effects is still significant at
the 0.001 level of probability; for females,
the test is not significant at 0.10 in Round
I and significant at 0.05 in Round II. The
result for females is not disturbing, in light
of the fact that in Round JI only 13 of the

3,841 are coded with occupations, the rest
being “not available.” One occupation class
(with only one subject) accounts for onethird of the total sum of squares due to
socioeconomic status in Round II. Of the
total variation in the age-round-replicateadjusted 1n-cholesterol data, socioeconomic
indicators account for 1.80 per cent in
males and 0.57 per cent in females; of the
total variation in the 1n-cholesterol data
unadjusted for any other variables, socioeconomic indicators account for 0.76 per
cent in males and 0.23 per cent in females.

As with the test of socioeconomic status
effects taken together, the separate tests for
differences among classes for each of the
socioeconomic variables were significant for
males but not females (Part A in Tables 2
and 3). The inference about occupation and
income from the pooled data does not

change when each round is analyzed separately (Part B in Tables 2 and 3). There
is an inconsistency between rounds for
education, as we will note below.

The socioeconomic classes which actually
provided no information about education
(Classes 1 and 2), occupation (Class 1),
or income (Class 1) were included in the
analysis to maintain the sample and will
be used along with all other classes to adjust the data to reduce its variation in
preparation for further analyses. With the
no-information classes removed from the
analyses, the inferences which are drawn
from Tables 2 and 3 are essentially unchanged. For males, deviations among occupation and income-class means are still
significant at the 0.001 level of probability,
and deviations among _ education-class
means, while not quite significant at 0.01,
are significant at 0.025. For females, devi
 

ations among class means for each of the
three socioeconomic indicators taken separately are not significant at 0.10. Ignoring
the no-information classes, the changes in
the estimates of the effects (Table 4) of
socioeconomic status are constant among
classes within each socioeconomic indicator
and small (the largest in absolute value
being 0.00272, for education. Therefore,
comparisons among classes (Table 4) are
not distorted by including the “not available” class for education, occupation, and
income and the “under 18” class for education.

In testing for interactions (for both
sexes) between each pair of the three indicators, we find that none is significant at
0.05. This suggests that education, occupation, and income are statistically independent in their ability to identify variation in
serum cholesterol. Therefore, as we next exDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

amine the means of the individual classes
of each indicator, we feel justified in considering each indicator apart from, as well
as in conjunction with, the others.

Due to the fact that the effect on Incholesterol of socioeconomic indicators
(taken separately or combined) is statistically significant in males but not females,
the rest of this paper will be confined to a
consideration of the effects on serum cholesterol of each socioeconomic outcome for
males only. The test for equality of education class means (in males) is significant
at the 0.01 level of probability; but looking at each round individually, we find that
the Round I test is significant at 0.001
while the Round IT test is not significant
at 0.10 (Table 2). Therefore, there is an
indication that the connection between educational level and serum cholesterol may
not be consistent between rounds. Although
we could have taken those people measured
in only one round and used analysis of
variance to test for a round by class interaction here, we chose not to reduce the
data set in this way, preferring instead to
keep the sample intact.

Hence, we proceeded to examine the individual effects based on the rounds pooled.
Table 4 suggests that each class comprised
of individuals having less education than
high-school graduates deviates negatively
from the overall mean, while each class
containing subjects with a high-school education or greater deviates positively. However, Scheffé simultaneous 95 per cent confidence intervals for contrasts which were
chosen in advance showed no significant
difference between individuals with a high
school education or more and those with
less, or between either of those two classes
and the under-18 and _ no-information
classes.

For occupation, whether we consider the
rounds pooled or each round separately,
the F-tests are significant at the 0.001 level.

Given education, the tests are still significant at 0.001 for the rounds pooled and
Round II and 0.01 for Round I. Hence,
there is strong evidence for a relationship
between occupational class and serum cholesterol, even after an adjustment for educational class. The occupation classes with
the highest levels of serum cholesterol in
the data unadjusted for education are sales
personnel, managerial and office personnel,
and professional and semi-professional individuals; those with the lowest levels of
serum cholesterol are unskilled, unemployed, and clerical and kindred workers
(Table 4). Other classes with sizable negative effects are agricultural and semi-skilled
workers. Those with effects nearly zero are
“not available,” skilled, and domestic
workers.

The individual effects of occupation given
education are essentially the same as those
for occupation considered independent of
education, except for the professional and
semi-professional class, which has a negligible effect after adjustment for education.
of serum cholesterol in the professional class
This result is not unexpected, since the professional occupation class contains mostly
people in the college-educated classes, which
have high serum cholesterol; the high level
(with education not accounted for) is
eliminated when education is taken into
account.

 

Variation in Serum Cholesterol 41

For multiple comparisons among class
means, the occupation classes were rearranged into “white-collar” (professional,
managerial and office, clerical and kindred,
and sales), “blue-collar” (skilled, semiskilled, domestic, and unskilled), and agricultural workers along with those who are
unemployed or for whom there is no information. Scheffé simultaneous 95 per cent
confidence intervals show that white-collar
workers have statistically significantly
greater serum cholesterol than a combined
class made up of blue-collar and agricultural workers; this contrast is not significant when education has been accounted
for. Contrasts of all other pairs of the
classes considered above (which were
chosen in advance) are not significant. Of
the comparisons chosen after we looked at
these data, a number are significant (Table 5).

Testing for a relationship between serum
cholesterol and income, we find the pooledround test for equal class means to be significant at 0.001; the test is significant at
0.001 for Round I and 0.01 for Round II.
Given education and occupation, the tests
are significant at 0.01 for the rounds combined and Round I, and 0.05 for Round II.
An increase in serum cholesterol with increasing income (with education and occupation accounted for) is indicated. In the
data unadjusted for education and occu

pation, those classes with individuals with
family income over $7,000 have aboveaverage serum cholesterol (Table 4). The
“no-information” class has the smallest of
the negative effects.

For income given education and occupation, the effects are essentially the same
as for income examined independently,
although all are smaller in magnitude. The
Scheffé 95 per cent simultaneous confidence
intervals show those individuals with high
incomes (over $7,000) to have significantly
greater serum cholesterol than those with
low incomes (less than $7,000); this contrast is not significant when education and
occupation are accounted for. Of the contrasts not chosen in advance, we find those
individuals with income between $7,000 and
$15,000 to have statistically significantly
higher serum cholesterol than those with
incomes between $2,000 and $5,000, even
when the data have been adjusted for
education and occupation.

SUMMARY

Data collected on 4,619 males and 4,730
females sampled by the Tecumseh Community Health Study provide evidence for

Social Biology

a relationship between socioeconomic status,
as measured by occupation and level of
education and income, and serum cholesterol in males but not in females. There
is also, for males, a statistically significant
relationship between serum cholesterol and
each of the three socioeconomic indicators
taken separately. Greater than average
serum cholesterol is associated with those
individuals with more education and higher
family income. Sales, managerial and office,
and professional people have higher than
average serum cholesterol, while unskilled,
unemployed, and clerical workers have
lower than average serum cholesterol.

The socioeconomic status of an individual
accounts for only a small portion of the
natural variation among age-round-replicate-adjusted In-cholesterol values in the
sample of Tecumseh, Michigan (1.80 per
cent in males and 0.57 per cent in females).
