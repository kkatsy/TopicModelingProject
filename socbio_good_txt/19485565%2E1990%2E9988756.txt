Are Heritability Estimates Generalizable?
Lack of Evidence from Cross-sample Correlations

ABSTRACT: The majority of research indicates that estimates of heritability are not
generalizable beyond the specific sample on which they have been calculated. This research has

- been limited, however, in its scope. The present set of investigations center upon an

examination of previously reported heritability estimates for the scales of the Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). The first investigation correlates the estimates for
eight samples derived from a variety of published studies. The second investigation correlates
the DZ twin pair and MZ twin pair intraclass correlations from four of the first investigation’s
samples. The third investigation correlates the estimates from one study in which the same
sample was tested twice over a period of Jess than five years. It is concluded that no evidence is
available for the generalizability of these estimates of MMPI scale heritability either across
samples or even across time with the same sample.

The issue of differences in the heritability of personality traits has been under dispute for several years (e.g.,
Ahern et al., 1982; Carey, 1978; Carey
et al., 1978; Loehlin, 1978, 1982, 19865;
Vandenberg, 1967; Zonderman, 1982),
although there is growing agreement
that such differences probably exist
(Loehlin, 1986a). There is no agreement
across studies, however, as to what traits
are more heritable than others. Such
heritability estimates usually are viewed
as properties of a sample or population.
With this consideration in mind, Gottesman (1966) wrote that the heritability of
a personality trait should be viewed as
“sample specific until proved otherwise” (p. 201). Several researchers have
since attempted to find support for the
generalizability of heritability estimates
of specific traits.

Vandenberg (1967) compared the
heritability estimates described in separate studies for the scales of both the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI; Hathaway and McKinley, 1951) and the High School Personality Questionnaire (HSPQ; Cattell et
al., 1958). Three separate samples were
available for the heritability component
of both of these tests. Vandenberg concluded that, while there was evidence
for significant hereditary variance, there
was considerable fluctuation among the
samples in their estimates.

Cross-sample mathematical comparisons were undertaken by Loehlin and
Nichols (1976) for each set of these estimates (MMPI and HSPQ). In neither
set of comparisons were any of the coefficients of concordance significant.
Loehlin and Nichols concluded “‘that,

while identical twin pairs tend to be
more similar than fraternal pairs, it is
difficult to demonstrate that they are
consistently more similar on some traits
than others” (p. 46).

In another examination of the replicability of heritability estimates, Carey
et al. (1978) correlated these estimates
from five samples of twins that were derived from three separate studies employing the California Psychological Inventory (CPI; Gough, 1955). The
results indicated that only 1 out of the 10
possible between-sample correlations of
their heritability estimates was significant. The DZ and MZ twin pair intraclass correlations were then separately
correlated across samples. This set of
correlations gave evidence for a high degree of replicability across samples for
the MZ correlations but not for the DZ
correlations. Carey et al. concluded that
the MZ twin correlations were replicable across samples but that this replicability was not supported for the heritability estimates.

One byproduct of this lack of strong,
consistent evidence for cross-sample replicability of scale heritabilities was the
investigation of item heritability. It was
hypothesized that one consequence of
combining the items into scales was that
the genetic and environmental influence
of the more narrowly defined content
areas could be blurred. While research
has indicated that some CPI items may
be classed into high heritability and low
heritability groups (Horn et al., 1976),
there is often little consistency across
samples as to what items are in which
group (Loehlin, 1986a; Loehlin and
Nichols, 1976). Loehlin (1986a) concluded that, since such classifications for
items are not dependable across separate samples, attempting to estimate the
heritability of items in a personality

Social Biology

scale is probably not a useful procedure.
Instead, ‘‘we need to focus our measuring instruments more sharply, or at least
differently, in order to understand the
structure of genetics and environmental
influences on personality” (p. 602).

Different methods have been applied
for the estimation of the degree of heritability of personality traits. Heritability
estimates have been calculated for item
clusters (e.g., Loehlin, 1987), orthogonal factors derived from items (e.g.,
Rose, 1988), as well as orthogonal factors derived from item clusters (e.g.,
Loehlin, 1982). No one specific method,
however, has been applied frequently
enough to allow for investigations of
consistency across samples.

Thus, while there is growing evidence
for differential heritability among scales
within a particular sample, the evidence
is unclear as to how generalizable these
estimates are across different samples.
Those studies of personality that have
compared previously reported heritability estimates from separate samples
have not been generally supportive
(e.g., Carey et al., 1978). These comparisons, however, have been limited to
only two or three samples. The purpose
of the present set of investigations is to
research further the generalizability of
heritability estimates by an examination
of estimates reported for the most popular of objective personality assessment
devices: the MMPI.

This examination will take place in
three parts. Instead of comparing only
two or three sets of heritability estimates, the first portion of this study will
examine eight sets of estimates. The second portion will examine the consistency among four samples for the DZ
and MZ twin pair intraclass correlations. The final portion examines two
sets of estimates that were derived from

the same sample with a period of less
than five years between them. With the
perspective which might be gained from
such a comparison of a larger number of
heritability estimates and intraclass correlations, it is hoped that stronger statements may be made with regard to their
generalizability. Furthermore, employing such a method will allow for the possible expression of patterns as to what
variables might affect generalizability as
well as pointing to areas for future investigation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
INVESTIGATION I

Method.—The MMPI consists of 550
items, combining to form 10 clinical
scales (e.g., Hysteria, Paranoia) and
three validity scales (e.g., Lie). It has
been described repeatedly as being the
most widely used objective personality
assessment device in a wide variety of
settings (Brown and McGuire, 1976;
Lubin et al., 1985; Piotrowski et al.,
1985). Furthermore, it is viewed as being the most important objective personality test to learn in clinical training
centers (Moreland and Dahlstrom,
1983; Wade and Baker, 1977). Psychological Abstracts reports almost 5000
references to the MMPI between 1966
to 1988. The present study will focus on
the 10 original clinical scales as well as
five additional scales (K, Ego-Strength,
Anxiety, Repression, and Dysphoria).

In reviewing the literature on the
MMPI, eight different sets of heritability estimates were discovered (see Table
1). The number of estimates available in
each set ranged from 8 to 15, depending
on which of the MMPI’s scales that particular study described. To determine
the degree of their generalizability,
these sets of estimates were then correl

ated with one another. In addition,
these heritability estimates were also
correlated with the estimates of each
scale’s reliability. These correlations
were undertaken to overcome any difficulties due to the MMPI scale heritability estimates being related directly to
the differential reliability of its scales.
For all of these correlations, the largest
possible number of scales were always
included. The sources for these sets of
estimates were as follows:

1. Minnesota twins.—Gottesman
(1963) reported on research on the heritability of personality based on high
school students in Minneapolis and St.
Paul, Minnesota. This sample consisted
of 34 DZ (11 male and 23 female) and 34
MZ (12 male and 22 female) twin pairs.
Estimates were calculated by Gottesman by employing the formula
H= (Voz _— Vuz) / Voz where Voz
equaled the within-DZ pairs variance
estimate (mean square) and Vyz
equaled the within-MZ pairs variance
estimate (mean square). The estimates
of heritability adopted for the present
investigation included those estimates
from the 10 clinical scales and the 5 additional scales.

2. Harvard  twins.—Gottesman
(1965) calculated scale heritability estimates for the 10 clinical scales of the
MMPI. These were based on 68 pairs of
DZ twins and 82 pairs of MZ twins from
high schools in the greater Boston area.
These values were listed as “‘preliminary
analyses’? and employed the same
method of analysis as Gottesman
(1963).

Dworkin et al. (1976), in a follow-up
study of this same sample of twins, listed
revised F ratios for the significance of
genetic variance estimates. Three MZ
twin pairs were dropped leaving 68 DZ
(32 male and 36 female) and 79 MZ (34

male and 45 female) pairs in the sample.
This study also reported on the five additional scales. It is from the values listed
in Dworkin et al. that the heritability estimates representing the ‘‘Harvard
twins” were calculated. The heritability
estimates for the present investigation
were calculated from using the formula
H =(F-1)/ F.

3. Harvard twins (subset-adolescent).—Dworkin et al. (1976) reported
on a longitudinal study of the heritability of personality traits for the subjects
in Gottesman (1965). Forty-two pairs of
twins from the initial study were available for a follow-up testing (approximately 12 years later). This subset was
composed of 17 DZ pairs (9 male and 18
female) and 25 MZ pairs (9 male and 16
female) with an average age of 15.9
years. Heritability estimates for the
present study were calculated from the
reported F ratios for the 15 scales.

4, Harvard twins (subset-adult).—
This sample consists of the same subjects from the previous example with the
exception that the average age for this
sample was 27.9 years. Once again, heritability estimates for the 15 scales were
calculated from the reported F ratios.

5. Connecticut twins I.—Reznikoff
and Honeyman (1967) described a study
of 16 DZ and 18 MZ twin pairs from the
Connecticut Twin Registry (average
age: 39.9 years). While discussing their
findings in relation to those findings described in Gottesman (1963), they did
not list the estimates for the heritability
of the MMPI scales. F ratios for these estimates were later listed, however, by
Vandenberg (1967) in his comparison of
previous MMPI scale heritability research. The present investigation employed heritability estimates calculated
from these F ratios for the 10 clinical
scales.

6. Connecticut twins II.—Dies et al.
(1969) reported on MMPI research on
personality and smoking patterns. The
sample consisted of 37 DZ twin pairs
and 39 MZ twin pairs obtained through
the Connecticut Twin Registry. Dies et
al. reported that all subjects were born
in 1947 or earlier and the gender distribution was approximately equal across
groups. For the present investigation,
data was adopted for the 10 clinical
scales and 2 additional scales (EgoStrength and K). It should be noted that
no mention is made of subject overlap
between this sample and the previous
Connecticut twin sample.

The method of heritability calculation should be commented upon. Dies
et al. listed intraclass correlation coefficients for scores on each of the scales
separately for six separate subgroups.
These subgroups were ‘“‘Concordant
Smoking,’’ ‘‘Concordant Nonsmoking,” and “Discordant” for both
the DZ and the MZ twin pairs separately. For each scale, these correlations
were transformed into Fisher’s z scores.
They were then aggregated for the DZ
and MZ twin groups separately, weighting each subgroup according to its size.
The two resultant average z scores were
then transformed to twin pair group intraclass correlations.’ From these correlations, an estimate of heritability was
calculated using Nichols’ HR.?

7. Minnesota families.— Hill and Hill
(1973) reported on the administration of
the MMPI to first-born children (12

‘Such a z-score transformation in averaging
correlation coefficients reduces the effect of bias
due to small set sizes, small sample sizes, and heterogeneity in the correlations (Silver and Dunlop,
1987; Strube, 1988).

Nichols’ HR was employed as the method of
estimation from twin data since recent evidence
suggests that it may be the most theoretically
sound of the broad estimates of heritability
(Schonemann, 1989).

years and over) of 28 couples. What
made these couples of interest was that
all of the parents were administered the
MMPI in 1947 while they all were in the
ninth grade. The average age of the parents at this initial testing was 15.1 years
for men and 14.8 years for women. For
their children, the average age was 12.8
years for both sexes. To estimate scale
heritabilities for the 10 clinical scales
and for one additional scale (K), Hill
and Hill calculated midparent-offspring
regressions.

8. Texas families.—Heritability estimates based on midparent-midoffspring
regressions were calculated by Loehlin
et al. (1987) for all but two of the 10 clinical scales (Masculinity-Feminity and
Social Introversion were not included).
The research was part of the Texas
Adoption Project and the regressions
were based on 81 adopted children (average age: 17.0 years) and their biological parents.

9. Reliability. Hunsley et al. (1988)
calculated reliability estimates for the 10
clinical and 3 validity scales from the
MMPI. These estimates were based ona
meta-analytic investigation of calculations of internal consistency from over
70 studies published between 1970 and
1981. The resultant sample was diverse
and included over 5,800 subjects for
some of the scales. These estimates indicated high levels of reliability with a
range between 0.71 (Hypomania) and
0.84 (Psychasthenia) for the 13 scales.

Results and Discussion.—a cursory
overview of the heritability estimates
listed in Table 1 reveals the considerably
variability in the estimates. For example, some of the scale estimates were
outside the accepted range for a heritability estimate (0.00 to 1.00). Eight of
the 15 scales had at least one negative
heritability estimate. These negative es
Social Biology

timates were five of the eight samples. A
brief comparison between the samples
of these sets of estimates also reveals
how they differ between samples. For
example, the Psychasthenia scale has
the highest of the heritability estimates
from the Texas families sample but the
lowest of the estimates derived from the
Connecticut Twins I sample. Mathematical cross-sample comparisons, however, would allow for a more sensitive
examination of the generalizability of
the heritability estimates of the MMPI
scales.

An overview of these correlations, as
presented in Table 2, indicate little evidence for such generalizability. Of the
18 correlations involved, only four were
significant. Of these four significant correlations, only one was positive, and it
involved the adolescent subset of the
Harvard twins correlating with the
larger adolescent sample (r = 0.50,
p <0.05). Only one of the eight correlations with reliability was significant
(Connecticut Twins II; r= 0.71,
p<0.01).

Five sets of correlations could have
been viewed as having a greater likelihood of being significant, and these possibilities will be discussed. First, the
Minnesota and the Harvard twins might
have been thought to have had a
greater possibility of correlating significantly since the same researcher (Gottesman) employed very similar paradigms only a few years apart.
Nevertheless, there was no significant
correlation between the two sets of estimates (7 = 0.09, ns). Second, two sets
of estimates (Minnesota families and
Texas families) were based on the same
Statistical technique (midparentoffspring regression). Their correlation
might be thought to be at an advantage
because of this similarity, but it was not

significant (r = 0.40, ns). Third, two
samples were derived for separate studies from the Connecticut twin registry
but their correlation was also not significant (r = 0.16, ns). Fourth, two sets of
estimates were both based on Minnesota samples, but these were not correlated significantly (r = 0.02, ns). Finally,
the estimates of heritability based on
data from the Harvard twins adolescent
subset had a significant negative correlation with those estimates derived on the
same sample when tested 12 years later
(r = 0.63, p< 0.01).

Because of the large number of correlations involved in this matrix (36 correlations), the five significant correlations might have been the result of an
inflated Type I error rate. To correct for
this inflation, a multistage Bonferroni
procedure developed for multiple correlations was adopted (Larzalere and Mulaik, 1977). After this correction, only
the correlation between the reliability
estimates and the Connecticut Twins II
set of estimates remained significant.

. In light of the high negative correlation between the adolescent and adult
Harvard twin subset, it was decided to
further examine other data presented in
Dworkin et al. (1976). Data, similar to
that presented for the MMPI scales, was
available for the 18 scales of the CPI.
From this data, heritability estimates
were calculated for the adolescent and
adult subsets. These estimates were
then correlated as they were with the
MMPI. The result of this correlation
was that the estimates of heritability calculated on the adolescent Harvard twins
failed to correlate with the estimates
based on their assessment 12 years later
(r = 0.04, ns).

INVESTIGATION II

Method.—In an attempt to examine

Social Biology

further the degree of consistency that
exists among these sets of heritability estimates, we employed a method similar
to that described by Carey et al. (1978).
In this research, Cary et al. correlated
the DZ and the MZ twin pair intraclass
correlations (after these correlations
were transformed to Fisher’s z scores).
According to the authors, correlating
these estimates “allows an evaluation of
the consistency of results across studies
independently of whether or not the
scales are, in reality, differentially heritable” (p. 304).

In order to parallel the methodology
of Carey et al., the studies used in the
first investigation were reviewed. This
review netted four samples that also reported both the DZ and the MZ twin
pair intraclass correlations for the
MMPI scales: (1) Minnesota twins
(Gottesman, 1963); (2) Harvard twins
(subset-adolescent; Dworkin et al.,
1976); (3) Harvard twins (subset-adult;
Dworkin et al.); and (4) Connecticut
Twins II (Dies et al., 1969). The intraclass correlations for the MMPI scales
were then transformed to z-scores and
intercorrelated.

As in the previous investigation, it
could be argued that the DZ and MZ
correlations are directly related to the
tests’ reliability. In an attempt to determine if such a relation exists, these intraclass correlations were also correlated
with the estimates of each scale’s reliability. The estimates used were those
calculated by Hunsley et al. (1988).

Finally, the Dworkin et al. (1976) research on the Harvard twins also listed
the DZ and MZ intraclass correlations
for 18 CPI scales. To further examine
the effects of the passage of time on
the consistency of these relations, the
same procedure used for the MMPI
scales was undertaken for these CPI

Results and Discussion.—As shown
in Table 3, of the six DZ intercorrelations and the six MZ intercorrelations
for the MMPI scales, only one intercorrelation was significant: Harvard adolescent MZ subset and the same subset

The CPI scale intercorrelations also
failed to provide evidence for the consistency of intraclass correlations over
time. Neither the DZ intercorrelation

ficant (r = 0.22, ns) andr = 0.28, ns respectively). Thus, only the two samples
which would be viewed as the most similar demonstrated any degree of significant replicability.

In a further attempt to support the replicability of the DZ twin pair intraclass
correlations, Carey et al. (1978) correlated these intraclass correlations with
the MZ twin pair intraclass correlations.
As can be seen in an examination of
these correlations for the MMPI scales
(see Table 4), only the Harvard adult
DZ twin pairs correlated with any of the
MZ twin pairs (Minnesota twins;
r= 0.49, p<0.05). Once again, this
correlation was no longer at a level necessary for statistical significance after a
multistage Bonferroni procedure was
completed for a 16 correlation matrix.

These intraclass correlations were
also correlated with the estimates of reliability for the MMPI scales. As can be
seen in Table 2, of the eight resultant
correlations, the reliability estimates
only correlated significantly with the intraclass correlations of the Connecticut
DZ twins (r = 0.80, p<0.01). In this
instance, the correlation remained significant after a multistage Bonferroni procedure was adopted for an eight correlation matrix. Thus, there was little
evidence that either the DZ or the MZ
intraclass correlations were related directly to the differential reliability of the
MMPI scales.

Intercorrelations of the CPI scale DZ
and MZ heritabilities were also undertaken. The adolescent DZ twin correlations were not supported as replicable
with regard to either the adolescent MZ
twin pairs (r = 0.35, ns) or the adult MZ
twins (r = —0.28, ns). A similar lack of
evidence for replicability was found for
the adult DZ twins when they were correlated with either the adolescent or

adult MZ twins (r = 0.22, ns andr = —
0.04, ns respectively). Thus, little evidence can be found from this series of
correlations for the replicability across
samples or across time for either the DZ
or MZ twin pair intraclass correlations.

INVESTIGATION III

Method.—Two sets of MMPI heritability estimates were available from a
study by Pogue-Geile and Rose (1985).
In that study, 62 DZ twin pairs (24 male
and 38 female twin pairs) and 71 MZ
twin pairs (25 males and 46 female pairs)
were solicited from the Indiana University Twin Panel. The twins (average age:
20 years) first completed the full MMPI
and then, 4.5 years later, completed a
shortened version of the MMPI.

Pogue-Geile and Rose did not report
on all of the MMPI scales. They did report on the two standard clinical scales
(Psychopathic Deviate and Schizophrenia). They also reported on Wiggins
(1966) Social Maladjustment and Religiousity scales, the Welsh (1956) A
scale, and the Depression-30 scale (Dempsey, 1964). While not listing heritability estimates, they do report the DZ
and MZ intraclass correlations and the
Fw test. Nichols’ HR, Holzinger’s H, |
and Falconer’s h? were calculated from
this data. Since the Fw’s were related to
the scale’s heritability, they were also
employed in the analysis. To determine
if the heritability estimates were comparable, even within the same sample
across only 4.5 years, we made correlations of these estimates.

Results and Discussion.—None of
the four correlations between the two
time periods was significant. This remained true if the MMPI heritability estimates were calculated by Nichols’ HR
(r = —0.49, ns), Holzinger’s H (r =

—0.09, ns), Falconer’s h? (r = —0.32,
ns), or the Fw’s (r = —0.31, ns). Thus,
with two assessments done over a period
of less than five years on the same sample of over 130 twin pairs, there was no
evidence of any generalizability of heritability estimates for the MMPI.

RESULTS AND GENERAL
DISCUSSION

The results of the present set of investigations offer further support for the
proposal that the heritability estimates
should be viewed as sample specific
(Gottesman, 1966). In addition, an argument can be put forward for the discontinuation of making further inferences based on simple calculations of
such broad estimates of heritability
(e.g., Holzinger’s H, midparentmidoffspring regression). Such estimates have been criticized previously as
being biased, unreliable, and inaccurate
(cf., Haviland et al., 1982; Wahlstein,
1979). In the present study, an examination of the estimates listed in Table 1
would indicate that many MMPI heritability estimates are outside the accepted
range for such estimates. While these estimates may be based on theoretically
sound procedures, they are often found
to be in conflict with the actual empirical
data (Schonemann, 1988). Such heritability estimates, however, may be useful
in the initial stages of research for rough
descriptions of a sample (Loehlin, 1979;
Plomin and Foch, 1980). After these initial stages, the most promising method
for estimating genetic and environmental variance is model-fitting.

The testing of falsifiable mathematical models through the use of modelfitting has advanced considerably in recent years (Martin et al., 1989). During

Heritability Estimates 157

this period, it has been applied several
times in attempts to determine estimates
for the effects of heredity and environment to personality test scales (e.g., Carey and Rice, 1983; Loehlin, 1985) as
well as their relation to other variables
(e.g., willingness to drive when drunk;
Martin and Boomsma, 1989). Such
studies, while more frequent than ever
before (cf., Boomsma et al., 1989;
Loehlin et al., 1988), have not yet provided enough data to allow for the comparison across samples of heritability estimates.

By reviewing some of the results of
model-fitting research, a degree of light
can be shed on the lack of generalizability of heritability estimates. One of the
Strongest and most important of these
results is that the assumptions which are
important for fitting the best model to
One trait need not be important for the
model that best fits another trait (Carey
and Rice, 1983; Loehlin, 1985; Rose et
al., 1988; Zonderman, 1982). Some of
the assumptions which have been shown
to be important include the effects of assortative mating, equal environmental
variance for twins, sex differences, age,
and genetic dominance variance. Some
of these effects can be discussed with regard to the results of the present set of
investigations.

The important effect of age on heritability estimates has been underscored by
the present sets of correlations. In several instances, there was no support
over time for consistency in the degree
to which the MMPI scales (or the CPI
scales) are affected by genetic variance,
even after only 41/2 years. Similar results
have been described for other personality tests (e.g., Eysenck Personality
Questionnaire; Young et al., 1980).
Thus, if estimates derived from methods
such as Holzinger’s H are to be general

ized, precautions must be taken to make
certain that the samples are all of equal
age. Even then, they can only be generalized to samples of equal age. Also,
model-fitting should make sure to include age as a variable in analysis.

The samples should also contain subjects of only one sex. Half of the sets of
estimates were reported from twin research that also had separate estimates
for men and women (e.g., Minnesota
twins; Gottesman, 1963). Other results,
however, only reported on combined
twin samples (e.g., Connecticut Twins I;
Reznikoff and Honeyman, 1967). Also,
midparent-midoffspring regression
analyses were based on samples which
necessarily combined both sexes (e.g.,
Minnesota families; Hill and Hill, 1973).
The present examination employed the
estimates derived from combined samples in order to increase the consistency
across samples. Future research, however, will need to report separate estimates or include gender in any modelfitting.

Another important aspect of this type
of research which is often not mentioned
is the difficulty with the reliability of the
heritability estimates (Haviland et al.,
1983; Kendler, 1989). The heritability
estimates involved in much of this form
of research are based on correlations
and difference scores. The simplest example is that of Falconer’s h?: h? = 2
("mz — pz). The first portions to be calculated would be the correlations which
would be attenuated by any unreliability
in the measure. Then, the difference
would be calculated between these correlations. In an attempt to determine
generalizability, correlations of these
two sets of difference scores is then undertaken. As Gardner and Neufeld
(1987) have pointed out, the interpretations of correlations of difference scores

Social Biology

are difficult and equivocal (even without
the addition of any difficulties inherent
in the initial correlations).

These problems are further confounded by the study’s small sample
sizes. Loehlin and Nichols (1976) have
pointed out that a sample of 400 twin
pairs of each kind would still result in a
standard error of 12 per cent. This sample is considerably larger than that employed in any of the 12 estimate sets employed in the present investigation.
Even though the reliability estimates of
the MMPI scales did not relate directly
to their heritabilities or to the twin pairs
intraclass correlations, they may affect
the results in more complex ways which
are dependent on the particular heritability model involved. Any future
model-fitting will also need to incorporate the reliability of their measures into
its early stages.

The formulas which have been employed traditionally for the estimates of
heritability have also been criticized for
their oversimplicity. Perhaps the most
important criticism has been that they
often divide variance into only two
broad separate factors: genetic and environment. For example, these formulas
and models do not include the confounding of the factors due to genotypeenvironment interaction and correlation
(Haviland et al., 1983; Plomin et al.,
1977; Plomin and Loehlin, 1989). Because of the several weaknesses associated with such estimates, they should
only be used in limited circumstances
with specific purposes as an initial stage
of examination (Thiessen, 1979).

To summarize, the present investigations have failed to provide evidence for
the generalizability of MMPI scale heritability estimates. This result is in keeping with similar research on the generalizability of estimates for CPI scales and

items (Carey et al., 1978; Loehlin,
1986a; Loehlin and Nichols, 1976).
While the majority of research on
MMPI scale heritability was published
more than 15 years ago, more recent research has been published (Loehlin et
al., 1987) and is in progress at the
present time (T. J. Bouchard, Personal
Communication, March 17, 1989). Future research employing heritability estimates of personality traits should take
into account the various problems asso

ciated with the estimates employed in
the present set of investigations. The future of such calculations should be based
on model-fitting approaches to different
methods of data collection (e.g., twin
studies, adoption studies) on the same
population (Loehlin, 1979).
