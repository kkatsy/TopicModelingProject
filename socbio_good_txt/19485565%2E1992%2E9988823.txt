in ABSTRACT: The relationship between human sex ratios at birth and caloric availability per capita
S was examined across different countries. Significant positive correlations were obtained between
o the amount of food a country had available and the percentage of male births. Furthermore,
5 increases or decreases in a country’s caloric availability were related to corresponding changes

Sin that country’s sex ratio. These results provide evidence of adaptive sex ratio biasing in
9 humans. The physiological mechanism by which this effect operates is probably higher mortality
© rates for male embryos and fetuses as a result of nutritional deficiencies and associated stressors.

Evolutionary theory suggests that
cj Many structural features and behaviors
= of an organism have adaptive signifi=cance by means of their ability either to
Ssincrease that organism’s ability to sur5 Vive or to increase its reproductive out2 put. Influencing the sex ratio of offSo ‘spring is one way that some organisms
£&can increase their reproductive success
5 (Charnoy, 1982; Maynard Smith, 1978;
‘= Williams, 1975). In polygynous systems where only the fittest males reS produce, parental investment in a son
‘Sof good quality may yield greater re$ turns than comparable investment in a
‘sdaughter of good quality. A mother
©omight therefore prefer to produce sons
when she has the resources necessary
to give them a better than average
competitive ability, and daughters
when she does not.

There is convincing evidence that
invertebrates manipulate the sex ratio
of their offspring so as to maximize
their own fitness (Charnov, 1982). In
haplodiploid species, mothers can directly influence the sex ratio by fertilizing eggs so they will develop into females and leaving unfertilized eggs to

45 08

develop into males. Although the evidence is less consistent, and the magnitude of the effect tends to be smaller,
there is evidence that sex ratio variation also occurs in some birds (CluttonBrock, 1986) and some mammals
(Clutton-Brock and Iason, 1986).

In humans, there has been very little
study of whether adaptive variation in
the sex ratio occurs. Nevertheless,
many factors known to be associated
with variations in the sex ratio at birth
appear to have adaptive value. Fewer
males are born with increasing birth order (James, 1987a; James and Rostron,
1985; Ruder, 1985) or multiple births
(Bulmer, 1970; James, 1975), perhaps
because of greater sibling competition
for resources. Fewer males are born
with increased paternal age, and, toa
lesser extent, with increased maternal
age (James, 1987a; James and Rostron, 1985; Ruder, 1985). More males
are born in the spring and summer
when food is more plentiful (Colombo,
1957; James, 19845). More males are
born during and after wars when there
is decreased male-male competition
for mates (James, 1987a; MacMahon

285

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

286 Williams and Gloster

and Pugh, 1954). Fewer males are born
to fathers with high levels of stress (Little, Rigsby, and Little, 1987; Schuster
and Schuster, 1972). Couples with low
coital rates are less likely to produce
males (James, 1983; 1986; 1987b) (less
fit males, either because of age or dominance status, are likely to have lower
coital rates).

The above evidence suggests that
adaptive variation of the human sex ratio does occur. The purpose of the
present study is to determine whether
human sex ratio variation also occurs
as a function of caloric intake. Because
there is a direct positive relationship
between a mother’s prepregnancy
weight and the birth weight of her baby
(Magnus et al., 1984; Peckham and
Christianson, 1971), it might be expected that more males would be born
to mothers with high caloric intake,
and fewer males to mothers with low
caloric intake. Although fertility and
twinning rates in humans are related to
the mother’s percentage of body fat
(Frisch, 1988; Campbell et al., 1974),
the relationship between caloric intake
and sex ratio has not been directly investigated.

The few studies relevant to this issue
have not supported the prediction. No
changes in the sex ratio occurred in the
United States during the 1930’s Depression (Ciocco, 1938), in Leningrad
following the 1942 siege (Antonov,
1947), or in Holland following the famine of 1944-45 (Stein and Susser,
1978). On the basis of these studies,
James (1987a), in his review of the factors affecting the sex ratio, concluded
that nutrition did not likely have an effect. However, there is reason to reexamine this evidence. The fetus is extremely efficient at extracting calories

 

Social Biology

in short-term periods of deprivation
(Hytten, 1983). The famine in Leningrad lasted only six months and the one
in Holland, seven months. Follow-up
studies of children born during the
Dutch famine show them to be “well
grown” (Hytten, 1983) and with no intellectual deficits at age 18 (Stein et al.,
1975), which is consistent with the possibility that these famines were of too
short a duration to affect the sex ratio.

In any case, the effects of short-term
famines in developed countries is only
one way of investigating the relationship between caloric intake and sex ratio. The present paper reexamined this
issue by looking at the relation between various country’s caloric supply
per capita and their sex ratio at birth.
Since some countries consume twice as
many calories per capita as other countries, this approach not only permits
examination of whether malnourished
countries have a lowered sex ratio, but
also whether countries that overconsume have a higher sex ratio. Furthermore, because many of these consumption patterns are long-standing (i.e.,
Western overconsumption and Third
World underconsumption), the potential for actual alteration in the sex ratio
should be higher.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Information on a country’s caloric
supply per capita (as a percentage of
requirements) for the years 1975 to
1980 was obtained from the World Tables published by the World Bank
(1983). For the years 1982 to 1984, this
information was obtained from World
Resources by the International Institute for Environment and Development and the World Resources Insti
 
Vol. 39, No. 3-4

tute (1987). Information on the
number of female and male live births
from 1967 to 1986 was obtained from
the United Nations Demographic Yearbook for 1986. All available countries
were included in the analysis unless information on either caloric availability
or sex ratio was not available, or if the
country had fewer than six thousand
wy births per year. Also, because birth
= records were of questionable accuracy
‘i in some developing countries, it was
8 decided beforehand that sex ratio out% liers + 3 standard deviations from the
G mean would also be excluded (result© ing in the exclusion of 5/222 countries).
2 Two types of calculations were
cn done.
1. A Pearson product-moment cor5 "= relation was calculated between the avSerage caloric supply per capita for a
5 two-year period and the percentage of
= male births for the second year. This
© procedure allowed for the possibility
“= that sex ratio variation might occur ei5 ther at the point of conception or by
‘=< differential mortality during pregnancy. Three sets of years were examined: (a) caloric availability for 1976
2 and 1977 as it related to percentage of
2 = male births for 1977; (5) caloric avail2 & ability for 1979 and 1980 as it related to
A percentage of male births for 1980; and
6) caloric availability for 1982 to 1984
as it related to percentage of male
births for 1984.

2. The second calculation used a
Pearson product-moment correlation
to examine whether changes in a country’s caloric availability were associated with changes in its sex ratio.
Countries were included in this analysis only if they had a stable three-year
period where their caloric supply varied by less than 5 per cent. The change

in the average caloric supply from this
three-year period to the subsequent
two-year period was correlated with
the change in the percentage of male
births from the third year of this threeyear period to the second year of the
subsequent two-year period.

RESULTS

1. (a) A nonsignificant correlation
coefficient of 0.140, p > 0.05 (df=59)
was obtained between average caloric
availability for 1976 and 1977 and percentage of male births for 1977. (b) A
significant correlation coefficient of
0.365, p < 0.01 (df=57) was obtained
between average caloric availability for
1979 and 1980 and percentage of male
births for 1980. (c) A significant correlation coefficient of 0.369, p<0.01
(df=45) was obtained between average caloric availability for 1982 to 1984
and percentage of male births for 1984.

2. A significant correlation coefficient of 0.524, p<0.01 (df=48) was
obtained when the change in caloric
supply from a stable three-year period
to the two subsequent years was correlated with change in percentage of
male births from the third year of this
three-year period to the second year of
the subsequent two-year period. The
data for this calculation are presented
in Figure 1.

DISCUSSION

The results are largely consistent
with predictions of adaptive sex ratio
biasing. Countries with lower caloric
availability or who experience a sudden decrease in caloric availability tend
to have a lower percentage of male
births. Countries with higher caloric

availability or that experience sudden
increases in caloric availability tend to
have a higher percentage of male
births. Although deviations from the
average percentage of 51.33 per cent
are small (standard deviation of only
0.55 per cent), a small deviation translates into many thousands of excess
male or female births in populous
countries.

The percentage of variance accounted for by changes in caloric supply is less than 28 per cent. However,
there are several confounds that may
have diminished the magnitude of

these correlations. One is the exclusion
of many of the most impoverished
countries because of the unavailability
of birth and/or caloric supply data.
Only 13 per cent of the countries included in the analysis had caloric supplies below 100 per cent of requirements, whereas the World Tables
indicate that in 1980 this occurred in 36
per cent of all countries. A related
problem concerns the overrepresentation of countries with caloric oversupply. Fifty-four per cent of countries
included in the analysis had caloric
supplies greater than 120 per cent of

 
 

Vol. 39, No. 3-4

requirements. Changes in caloric supply from 120 to 130 per cent might be
expected to influence sex ratios less
than a change from 80 to 90 per cent.
Furthermore, gross obesity during
pregnancy is a risk factor for birth and
pregnancy complications that may decrease the likelihood of a live male
birth (Peckham and Christianson,
1971; Gillmer, 1983). Another problem concerns the practice of female in& fanticide and failure to report female
8 births that occurs in some developing
Ecountries (Repetto, 1972; Jeffery et
®al., 1984). A final issue concerns the
o problematic relationship between ca7 loric availability and caloric intake.
>: The availability of food within a coun"_ try does not ensure equal distribution
“of the food, nor does it ensure conS sumption of the food.
The mechanism of this effect on sex
S ratio is uncertain. Although the effect
‘s could possibly be operating through a
&third variable such as parental age,
«parity, or race (James, 1984a; 1985),
‘the evidence that changes in caloric
~ supply are related to changes in the sex
Bratio within the same country argues
against a mediating variable. By the
same token, it is possible that caloric
< availability may be mediating the rela2 tionships that exist between sex ratio
© and parental age, parity, and race.
Although the physiological mechanism of this effect could theoretically
operate at either the point of conception or during the pregnancy, the latter
possibility seems more likely. Maynard
Smith (1978) has argued that there
does not exist a plausible physiological
mechanism by which diploid species
could alter their sex ratio at conception. Furthermore, Reiss (1987) points
out that in diploid species maternal
control over the sex ratio at conception

is always going to be actively opposed
by the sperm. Altruistic sperm that allowed themselves to be correctly identified by the mother as Y- or X-bearing
will not be chosen as often as sperm
that can disguise their identity and pass
as either X- or Y-bearing. On the other
hand, there is good evidence that
males have a greater mortality rate
during pregnancy (Hassold et al., 1983;
Jakobovits et al., 1987; KellokumpuLehtinen and Pelliniemi, 1984; McMillen, 1979), although there are dissenters from this view (Huisjes, 1984).
Although difficult to estimate, the percentage of male births at conception
may be as high as 54.5 per cent (McMillen, 1979) which declines to 51.4
per cent at birth. Furthermore, malnutrition is a prenatal risk factor known
to increase the likelihood of pregnancy
complications, abortion, and stillbirth
(Brasel, 1978; National Centre for
Health Statistics, 1986; WorthingtonRoberts et al., 1985).

CONCLUSIONS

This study found that the amount of
food a country has available had a significant positive correlation with that
country’s percentage of male births in
two out of the three time periods examined. Furthermore, increases or decreases in a country’s availability of
food from a stable three-year period
was found to be significantly related to
corresponding changes in that country’s sex ratio at birth.

These results provide evidence of
adaptive sex ratio biasing in humans.
The physiological mechanism by which
this effect operates may be higher mortality rates for male embryos and fetuses as a result of nutritional deficiencies during gestation.
