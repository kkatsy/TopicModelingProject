Legalization of Consensual Unions in Mexico

ABSTRACT: There is ample evidence that there are important behavioral differences in Latin
America between couples living in consensual unions and those who are legally married. In this
paper, we examine the frequency of and variations in legalization of consensual unions in Mexico, using data from the 1976-77 Encuesta Mexicana de Fecundidad. Our results indicate that
the frequency of legalization of consensual unions appears to have risen among recent cohorts.
Women in first unions, those who start a union at older ages, and those who are more highly
educated are also more likely to marry their partners. Our results also indicate that pregnancy
does not appear to be a major factor precipitating legalization, and that whether a couple lived
together before marriage has no effect on the stability of the marriage.

In Mexico, as elsewhere in Latin
America, socially sanctioned conjugal
unions take several different forms. The
two primary forms are: marriages and
consensual unions. Roughly 12 per cent
of all women in unions at the time of the
Mexican Fertility Survey were in consensual unions, but a substantially larger
proportion had lived in a consensual union at some time in their lives (Quilodran, 1982). There is ample evidence
that there are important behavioral differences between couples living in each
type of union, including a significantly
higher probability of separation for
those in consensual unions (Potter and
Ojeda, 1982). Thus, in studies of nuptiality and fertility patterns, it is often important to distinguish between unions of
different types. The distinction between
consensual unions and marriages, however, is complicated by the fact that
many couples in consensual unions
eventually marry their partners in a civil
and/or religious ceremony. Unfortu
nately, relatively little is known about
this process, which we will refer to as legalization,! or about which couples are
most likely to legalize.

In this paper, our goal is to examine
legalization in Mexico using data from
the Encuesta Mexicana de Fecundidad
(EMF) conducted in 1976-77 in connection with the World Fertility Survey.
This analysis is an extension of an earlier
study (described below) of legalization
in Latin America, based on data froma
set of surveys taken in rural and semiurban areas in 1969-70 as part of CELADE’s program of comparative fertility surveys in Latin America

'The term “legalization” is used to indicate the
transition from cohabitation to marriage, either by
a civil or religious marriage or both. The vast majority of such marriages are either civil or a combination of civil and religious. Only 5 per cent of ongoing unions at the time of the EMF interview
were religious only. Quilodran (1982) indicates
that “marriage ‘only by the church’ is less and less
common, and currently persists only in the most
rural localities.”

(PECFAL). Our primary objective is to
describe legalization in Mexico as part
of the Mexican nuptiality pattern. We
examine the characteristics of women
initially entering consensual unions and
legal marriages, the frequency and timing of legalization of consensual unions
and its relationship to fertility, and the
resulting stability of legalized unions relative to legal marriages without prior cohabitation.” Our results are also compared with those from the earlier
Mexican PECFAL survey as a check on
their validity.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH

The study of legalization of consensual unions in Latin America has been
hampered by a paucity of data. By
definition, consensual unions are not
registered in vital registration systems,
and they are often underreported in censuses (Camisa, 1978; Florez and Goldman, 1980; Ordorica and Potter, 1980;
Quilodran, 1982). Mortara (1964)
points out that only consensual unions
which “have a certain character or permanence”’ are usually recorded, that
women are more apt to report the existence of these unions than are men, and
that certain respondents are likely to report that they are legally married rather
than admit that they are in an informal
union. Analysis of legalizations is fur
Legalization of consensual unions is not the
only kind of union transition with the same partner. Acomplete analysis of this topic might also include an examination of what we might call sanctification of marriages, that is, the change from a
civil to a religiously sanctioned marriage through a
second wedding ceremony performed by a priest
some time after the civil marriage. Unfortunately,
neither EMF data nor those from the earlier PECFAL surveys permit us to determine whether a
marriage reported retrospectively as both civil and
religious had been initiated as such, or whether the
religious rites came after the civil ceremony.

ther complicated by the failure of most
vital registration systems and censuses
to distinguish between legal marriages
with and without prior cohabitation.
The exceptions are Panama in 1967 and
Guatemala in 1957, for which data from
vital registration indicate that about 30
per cent and 15 per cent, respectively, of
first Jegal marriages were preceded by
cohabitation with the same partner
(Camisa, 1978).

Of the series of fertility surveys in
Latin America over the past twenty
years, only two have included a full union history: the PECFAL rural surveys
conducted in several countries in 1969
and 1970 and the National Fertility Surveys conducted since 1975 in connection
with the World Fertility Survey. The
PECFAL surveys attempted to collect a
broad range of detailed fertility and
nuptiality information. In the nuptiality
history, all changes in union type were
recorded as separate unions and legalization is one of the possible types of union termination. The 1976 Encuesta
Mexicana de Fecundidad employed a
similar but more detailed format for its
union history. By contrast, the other
Latin American surveys in the WFS series used an altered version of the standard WFS questionnaire, which fails to
determine whether a woman had more
than one type of union with the same
partner. That is, termination of a consensual union and the beginning of a legal marriage with the same partner were
recorded as only one union. This unfortunate limitation of the WFS questionnaire not only makes the study of legalization impossible in all countries except
Mexico, but it confounds analysis cf union dissolution to an unknown extent
(Goldman, 1981).

The two previous studies which have
examined legalization in Latin America

both employed data from the PECFAL
surveys in Mexico, Colombia, Costa
Rica, and Peru. The PECFAL surveys
were based on self-weighted samples of
between two-thousand and threethousand women age 15 to 49 who lived
in rural or semi-urban areas, defined by
CELADE as areas with fewer than
20,000 inhabitants. Roughly 70 per cent
of the total population of each country
at the time of the surveys was living in
areas of this size. In the first study, Rosero (1978) indirectly estimated the frequency of legalization in each country.
He indicated that 10.2 per cent of Mexican women aged 15-49 had had both
consensual unions and legal marriages,
and that 90.3 per cent of these women
had first unions which were consensual.
The comparable figures for the other
three countries ranged from 8.1 to 15.2
per cent, and 79.6 to 97.7 per cent respectively. He also constructed life tables by duration of union for both consensual unions and legal marriages but
since exits from consensual unions consisted of legalizations, separations, and
widowhood combined, it is impossible
to infer the frequency of legalizations
from these data.? Rosero speculated,
along with a number of other writers
(CEPAL, 1975; Camisa, 1978; Stycos,
1968), that many legalizations occur as a
result of a pregnancy or birth, but he did
not attempt to test this hypothesis.

In a second analysis, Goldman and
Pebley (1981) used PECFAL data and
life table methods to look more directly
at the frequency of legalization, by duration of union. The results indicated that

3Moreover, in Rosero’s life tables, women who
formed second- or higher-order unions reentered
the life table at their duration since the onset of
first union; hence it is impossible to infer even the
frequency of termination of unions from these tables.

Consensual Unions in Mexico 201

within ten years of onset of cohabitation, the proportion of consensual unions which had been legalized was 22 per
cent in Mexico, 19 per cent in Colombia,
18 per cent in Costa Rica, and a significantly higher 35 per cent in Peru where
consensual unions were also more common. In all four countries, at any given
duration of union, women who began
cohabiting after age 17 and who had
some education were more likely to legalize a union. In Mexico, women in
consensual unions classified as observant Catholics were also significantly
more likely to legalize than other
women. The probability of a legal marriage occurring within ten years after the
beginning of cohabitation in Mexico was
38 per cent for practicing Catholics versus 22 per cent for other women. However, in the other three countries, religiosity seemed to make little difference.
The results also indicated that the timing
of legalization did not appear to be reJated to the occurrence of the first pregnancy or birth. In fact, there was no difference in the probability of legalization
between couples who did and did not
have a child within a consensual union.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Throughout this analysis, we measure the risk of legalization with life table procedures. Life tables, which are
indexed by duration of union (i.e.,
months or years since the onset of a consensual union), directly take into account length of exposure to the risk of
legalization. Specifically, life tables incorporate information from both unions
which have ended and unions which are
intact by interview date by determining
a union’s status at each duration.

Life table calculations can be based
upon either a single or double decre

ment table. In the double décrement life
table, we consider two categories of
events which can terminate a consensual
union: (1) legalization; (2) all other terminations, i.e., separation or death of
one partner. Although the event of interest is legalization, the frequency of
other types of terminations can affect
the per cent of consensual unions which
actually legalize; that is, if most consensual tinions end in a separation, few can
end in a legalization. By contrast, in the
single decrement life table, the only recorded termination is legalization, and
separation and death of a partner are
treated as censorings. Consensual unions which dissolve by the latter causes
contribute exposure to the risk of legalization up until the time of the separation or death. Hence, the single decrement life table probabilities are
hypothetical in that they refer to the per
cent of consensual unions which would
legalize by successive durations, if they
did not terminate by other causes.

We initially consider both single and
double decrement probabilities for the
entire sample of consensual unions (Table 2), but use only single decrement
values for comparisons among subgroups.’ By eliminating all competing
risks, single decrement tables provide a
standardized comparison of the risks of
legalization among different groups of

‘Calculation of single decrement rates, however, requires the assumption that the two events
of interest occur independent of one another. In
the case of legalization and separation, this assumption may not be valid. Unfortunately, as discussed in the text, the use of double decrement legalization rates, which are not comparable across
subgroups because of differing separation rates, is
equally unappealing. Faced with two alternatives,
neither of which is ideal, we have chosen to present
single decrement rates to facilitate interpretation
of our results. In any event, the direction of the
results remains the same for both single and double decrement rates.

women. Since the sample size in each interval of our life tables is relatively
small, we present cumulative probabilities of legalization by duration of union,
for most of our calculations.

DATA

The data used in this analysis come
from the 1976-77 Encuesta Mexicana de
Fecundidad (EMF). The EMF sample
was self-weighting and consisted of
13,080 households intended to represent the national population. As in other
WFS surveys, brief questionnaires were
completed for households, and eligible
women in each household were then interviewed with a detailed individual
questionnaire. Women were eligible for
interview if they were 20 to 49 years old,
or if they were 15 to 19 and had ever
been married or had a child (EMF First
Country Report, 1979, Vol. 1, p. 51),
The data used here are entirely from individual interviews of a total of 7,310
women, principally from the union and
birth histories. In the union history,
women were asked to supply the year
and month of the onset of each union,
type of union (civil, religious, or consensual), year and month of dissolution (if
applicable), and reason for dissolution
(including whether or not the union was
legalized). The reproductive history in
EMF collected the following data for
each pregnancy: the date it ended, the
type of outcome (live birth, stillbirth,
etc.) and gestation at the time of outcome for nonlive births.

Ordorica and Potter (1980) evaluated
the quality of data collected in the EMF,
using both internal consistency checks
and comparisons with other sources of
data..In general, they concluded that
“the survey gives every indication of
having been carried out with care and

Vol. 33, No. 34

the results seem, by and large, to be as
free from response error as one could
reasonably hope for”’ (p. 28). More specifically, their results indicate that “the
EMF nuptiality data appear to be significantly less affected by response error
than the results of other surveys in the
WES series that have been conducted in
countries at a similar level of economic
development, although there is some
evidence for oldest cohorts of misplacement of births” (p. 28). —

| COMPARISON OF
_ EMF ann PECFAL Data

Both to check further on data quality
and to facilitate subsequent comparison
of results between the two surveys, we
compared nuptiality and fertility from
the EMF and PECFAL Mexican surveys for the period of time and the portion of the population which they both
cover. Tabulations from the EMF were
made comparable to those from PECFAL by including only events prior to
January 1, 1970 (roughly the midpoint

of the PECFAL interviews) and by tab
ulating age for women interviewed in
EMF as of this date. Women younger
than 22 in the EMF and women 43 or
older in PECFAL were removed from
the analysis. Women younger than 22 at
the time of the EMF would not have met
the minimum PECFAL age criteria of
15 in 1970. Similarly, women 43 or older
as of PECFAL would be 50 or older by
the time of EMF. The result is that calculations as of January, 1970, are based
on women aged 15-42, for estimates derived from either the EMF or PECFAL.

The total pre-1970 EMF sample,
however, is still not strictly comparable
to the PECFAL sample, because all
PECFAL respondents had to live in areas containing fewer than 20,000 inhab
Consensual Unions in Mexico 203

itants, according to the criteria for eligibility. It is difficult to determine how to
select an EMF subsample which would
be comparable as far as the PECFAL
rural residence requirement. Since the
EMF collected a migration history for
each respondent, it would be theoretically possible to confine EMF tabulations to only those women who in 1970
lived in places with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants. However, the necessary data
were not coded onto the data tape. We
have chosen a simpler, although less satisfactory, approach. We compare PECFAL respondents with two groups: the
total EMF sample, and the sample of
women who lived in locations with a
population under 20,000 at the time of
the EMF survey. There are two reasons
why this second sample would not be
comparable to the PECFAL rural sample: migration between 1969 and 1976,
which has been primarily from rural to
urban areas, and growth in the size of
places from under 20,000 to over 20,000.
These limitations should be borne in
mind when interpreting subsequent
comparisons between the two surveys.

Initial comparisons of the age distributions, proportions of first unions
which are consensual, proportion of
women currently in a union, and mean
number of children ever born for respondents in the two surveys (as of January, 1970) indicated general agreement
between the two data sources. In most
cases, the PECFAL results fall somewhere between the total EMF and the
rural EMF results, as we might expect
from recent migration patterns and the
growth of rural areas. The results described in the next section compare estimates of the prevalence of consensual
unions and the frequency of legalization
of such unions, as derived from the two
surveys.

RESULTS
PREVALENCE OF CONSENSUAL UNIONS

Since the focus of this analysis is on
probabilities of legalizing consensual
unions, most of our calculations are restricted to women’s consensual unions.
Before examining the frequency of legalization, however, we briefly consider
the prevalence of consensual unions in
the EMF sample. Table 1 shows the per
cent of unions recorded in the EMF
nuptiality history which are consensual
by various characteristics of respondents. Overall, 28 per cent of all conjugal unions are consensual. First unions,
which comprise the majority of all unions, are more often consensual in rural
than in urban areas. For second and
higher order unions, consensual unions
are slightly more common in urban areas. Overall, the frequency of consensual unions is greater among higher
Social Biology

order unions, although in rural areas,
the proportion consensual is about the
same regardless of union order.

The proportion of unions which are
consensual is 31.7 for the PECFAL sample, which is very close to the 31.2 per
cent for rural EMF. The PECFAL and
rural EMF figures for first unions also
agree well. However, while 41.9 per
cent of PECFAL higher order unions
are consensual, the comparable figures
for the rural EMF sample is only 30 per
cent.

The second part of Table 1 indicates
that a women’s first union is more likely
to be consensual if she was younger at
interview, had an earlier age at union,
and had little or no education. These last
two results are consistent with the findings of previous analyses that women
enter consensual unions at younger ages
than they enter legal marriages and that
women in informal unions tend to be

from lower social strata (Yaukey and
Thorsen, 1972; Michielutte et al. , 1973).
The proportion of unions which are consensual in the rural EMF sample by age
at interview, age at union, and education are also quite similar to those from
the Mexico PECFAL survey (Goldman
and Pebley, 1981).

FREQUENCY OF LEGALIZATION

While consensual unions account for
more than a quarter of all unions in
Mexico and are often viewed as an ac

ceptable alternative to civil or religious
marriage, the figures in Table 2 suggest
that consensual unions are frequently
converted to legal marriages. Roughly
half of all consensual unions recorded in
the EMF become marriages by 25 years
duration. Few consensual unions remain intact beyond that point, due to
the combined effects of legalization,
separation, and widowhood. The frequency of legalization, as indicated by
double decrement values, is virtually
identical in urban and rural areas. How

ever, women in urban areas are more
likely to terminate their consensual! unions through separation, resulting in a
higher termination rate due to all causes
in urban areas. Legalizations and separations both tend to occur early in a union, with 30 per cent of unions terminating within two years. The single
decrement values indicate that in the absence of separation or widowhood, twothirds of consensual unions would eventually become legal marriages; single
decrement rates of legalization in urban
areas are somewhat higher than in rural
areas.
The probabilities of legalizatio

shown in Table 2 are substantially
higher than those we found for the PECFAL survey (shown in Table 3), even
when only the rural EMF figures are
considered. Such a difference could
result from a number of factors including a change in the pattern of legalization subsequent to 1970, differential
misreporting in the two surveys or differences in the sampling frames between

Social Biology

PECFAL and EMF. In Table 3, we recalculated the EMF probabilities of legalization by restriction of the sample to
unions which began prior to January,
1970, and which involved women living
in rural areas and older than 22 at the

- time of EMF interview (i.e., at least age

15 as of January, 1970). In addition, we
censored all ongoing unions as of January, 1970, to match the censoring effect
of the PECFAL interview. To ensure
comparability, the PECFAL probabilities were recalculated to eliminate
women too old (43+ years) to have
been eligible for the EMF interview
seven years later. As is apparent from
the figures in Table 4, the cumulative
probabilities of legalization for PECFAL remain lower than those for EMF
even when comparable samples are
used. Jn Figure 1, we have graphed the
duration-specific (uncumulated) probabilities of legalization for the comparable PECFAL and EMF samples, for the
first ten years of union. This figure indicates that most of the differences be

A comparison of the EMF and PECFAL union histories suggests that part
of the reason for the differences in legalization rates observed may result from
different questionnaire design. In the
EMF questionnaire, respondents were
asked for each marriage, the date the
marriage began, whether the marriage
was preceded by cohabitation with the
same partner, and if it was, when she began to live with that partner. In addition, the tabular format in which previous unions were recorded makes it
explicit that each union (whether or not
with the same individual) was to be recorded separately, and that legalization
is an appropriate type of union termination.

Although the intent was the same in
the PECFAL questionnaire, the questions are organized in a more confusing
manner. For each marriage, respondents are asked whether they lived with
the same partner prior to marriage. Regardless of the reply, they are then
asked “in what year and month were
you married (did you begin living together)?” It is left up to the interviewer
to record a consensual union preceding
a marriage aS a Separate union with a
separate starting date. This sequence of
questions may also have created some
confusion among respondents about
whether to give the date of marriage (legalization) or the date when they began
cohabitation. Furthermore, all respondents terminating a union were asked:
‘“‘How did this marriage (consensual union) end: death, separation or divorce?”. Note that “marrying a partner” is not explicitly included in the
question, although it is one of the response codes on the questionnaire. A
skillful interviewer who understood the
respondent’s history could have properly coded the questionnaire. However,

Social Biology

the sequence and wording of questions
in PECFAL leaves much more room for
confusion and miscoding than the EMF
questionnaire.

These differences in questionnaire
design between the two surveys may ‘
have meant that (1) consensual unions
which legalized at short durations were
less likely to be recorded in the PECFAL ‘survey than consensual unions
which were intact at interview or resulted in separation, and (2) even if the
consensual union was recorded, the
PECFAL questionnaire may have miscoded the legalization as another type of
termination. Some support for this latter hypothesis can be seen from Table 4:
The probabilities of separation and widowhood are higher for the PECFAL
sample than for the comparable EMF
sample. Since most of the differences
occur in the first year of union, these
data suggest that the legalizations of
brief unions may have been mistakenly
recorded as separations. Given the
more careful and less ambiguous design
and the more frequent probing of important points in the EMF union history
relative to the PECFAL questionnaire,
the EMF estimates of legalization would
appear more credible than those from
PECFAL.

VARIATIONS IN THE
PROBABILITY OF LEGALIZATION

As Table 5 shows, the probability of
legalization differs substantially between first-order unions and secondand higher-order unions for EMF respondents. By ten years after the beginning of the union, only 19 per cent of
higher-order unions have legalized compared with 46 per cent of first unions.
These results suggest that women with
more than one union may prefer cohabitation to marriage, that men may be less

likely to marry women who have had
several previous partners and perhaps
have children, or that many higherorder consensual unions may involve
previously married women who cannot
remarry because they were never formally divorced. Because of the large differences in the frequency of legalization
by order of union and the relatively
small numbers of higher-order unions,

 

Consensual Unions in Mexico 209

we restrict the remainder of the analysis
to first consensual unions,

Although the results in Table 1 indicate that women who are in older cohorts, who were older at first union, and
who are better educated are more likely
to have a legal marriage as their first union, we have yet to determine whether
these same characteristics increase the
probability of legalization for women
who initially enter a consensual union.
In Table 6, we present the probabilities
of legalization by selected durations of
union, according to a woman’s age at interview, age at beginning of first union,
and educational attainment. In our earlier work with the PECFAL survey, we
found that if a woman was an observant
Catholic she was much more likely to legalize her consensual union in Mexico
(Goldman and Pebley, 1981). Unfortunately, information on religion is not
available from the EMF.

The results in Table 6 suggest that legalization is more common among

younger cohorts, and among women
who marry above age 17. There are substantial differences by educational attainment, with well-educated women
being more likely to legalize a union.

Our attempt in Table 6 is to describe
variations in legalization rather than to
test hypotheses about determinants of
legalization. An analysis of determinants would have to take a multivariate
approach since variables such as age at
formation of consensual unton and educational level may be related.

LEGALIZATION AND FERTILITY

As noted earlier, some demographers have speculated that the greatest
impetus to legalize a consensual union
stems from desires on the part of couples
to legitimize their children. One of the
major findings of our earlier study of legalization in Latin America was that the
discovery of a pregnancy or the birth ofa
child does not increase substantially the
frequency of legalization. Given the limitations of the PECFAL sample, we
were anxious to test this hypothesis using a more recent and nationally representative survey such as the EMF.

A test of the strength of the association between fertility and legalization is
more complicated than other comparisons in this analysis. A simple comparison of legalization rates between (1)
consensual unions with no pregnancy or
birth and (2) consensual unions with a
pregnancy or birth yields absurd results.
Legalizations which occur soon after the
start of cohabitation will usually occur
before the women has had time to become pregnant. Hence, category (1) is
characterized by very high probabilities
of legalization at early durations.

A proper comparison involves calculation of exposure for women before and
after the onset of a pregnancy (or birth).

Pebley and Goldman

Social Biology

One life table is based upon exposure
for durations from the onset of cohabitation until the termination of the consensual union (or interview date) for
women with no pregnancy within the
union combined with the exposure for
durations from the onset of cohabitation
until the onset of pregnancy for the remaining women. The comparison life
table is based upon exposure for durations from the onset of pregnancy until
the terminations of union (or interview
date) for women with a pregnancy
within the union. In both life tables, duration is measured as time since the onset of cohabitation.

Selected values from the resulting life
tables are shown in Table 7. For the total
sample (shown in the first column) during the first year or two after pregnancy,
women are only slightly more likely to
legalize than those who are not pregnant
at the same durations of union. After
five years, however, the cumulative
probability of legalization is somewhat
higher for women who have had a pregnancy than those who have not—38 per
cent versus 30 per cent. The effect of a
pregnancy, to the extent that it exists,
appears to be gradual rather than immediate and to affect only unions occurring
subsequent to 1965.5

STABILITY OF LEGALIZED UNIONS

Goldman’s (1981) and Potter and
Ojeda’s (1982) results indicated that
couples in consensual unions in Latin
America are much more likely to separate than couples in legal marriages,
even if age at union and social character
5At most durations, the differences between
the rates of legalization (q,) for women with and
without a pregnancy are not statistically significant. However, the lack of significant differences
at some higher durations may be due to the very
small sample size in the “‘no pregnancy” category.

istics of the couples are taken into account. Using data from the EMF, Potter
and Ojeda point out “there is a strong
presumption that the decision to legalize
a consensual union will hinge on a couple’s (perhaps principally the woman’s)
evaluation of the stability of the union”
(1982, p. 2). Are couples in legalized
consensual unions also more likely to
stay together than couples who marry
without a trial period of cohabitation?
A life table comparison of the probabilities of a first marriage ending in separation, by whether or not the couple
lived together prior to marriage, is
shown in Table 8. For those marriages
which were preceded by cohabitation,
duration is measured as time since legalization. Our earlier results from the
PECFAL surveys (Goldman and Pebley, 1981) indicated that in all four countries included, marriages with prior cohabitations had less chance of
dissolution. The EMF results, however,

show that the probabilities of dissolution are the same regardless of whether
marriages were preceded by cohabitation.

One reason for the lack of difference
in dissolution rates between legalized
and initially legal marriages may be that

212 Pebley and Goldman

there are two selection processes in operation. As several researchers have
suggested, couples who believe they
have more stable relationships may initially enter legal marriages, foregoing
the trial period provided by a consensual
union; among those who do initially opt
for a trial period, only more stable unions progress to legalization (Quilodran, 1980; Potter and Ojeda, 1982).
Thus, legal marriages appear to be
equally stable regardless of the process
by which they are reached.

DISCUSSION

In this paper we have examined the
frequency of and variations in legalization of consensual unions in Mexico, using data from the 1976-77 Encuesta
Mexicana de Fecundidad. Our results
indicate that while consensual unions
are fairly common among Mexican
women, many are subsequently legalized. Approximately 30 per cent of first
consensual unions are legalized by five
years after the union was formed. The
vast majority (84 per cent) of consensual
unions dissolve by 25 years duration either through legalization or due to separation and widowhood. The frequency
of legalization is similar in both urban
and rural areas, even though consensual
unions are more common in rural areas.
First consensual unions are much more
likely to be legalized than those of
higher order. Women in more recent co
Social Biology

horts, who start a union at older ages,
and who are more educated, are more
likely to marry their partners.

There has been some speculation
that pregnancy may be an important factor precipitating the legalization of a
consensual union. Our earlier analysis
of the 1969 PECFAL survey data from
rural areas in four Latin American countries, including Mexico, indicated that
there was no difference in the probability of legalization between unions in
which a pregnancy occurred and those
without a pregnancy. By and large, the
results from our analysis of the EMF
data support this result. However, for
unions begun subsequent to 1965, there
appears to be a moderate difference after the first few years of union.

Finally, we looked at whether marriages resulting from legalizations are
more stable than first marriages for
couples who had not cohabited prior to
marriage. Our results indicate that there
is no difference in the probability of separation between the two groups. These
findings are in contrast to earlier results
from the PECFAL survey which indicated that cohabitation exerted a stabilizing effect on marriage.
