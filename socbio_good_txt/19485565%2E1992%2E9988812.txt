The Fitness of Human Sociobiology:
The Future Utility of Four Concepts

in Four Subdisciplines

ABSTRACT: Reported here are the results of a survey inquiring into the rate of acceptance of four
sociobiological concepts in regard to their usefulness for future research. Included in the survey
were members of four subdisciplines: animal behavior (biology), biological anthropology, cultural
anthropology, and developmental psychology. Three types of institutions were included: universities, four- and five-year colleges, and community colleges. A total of 1,631 responses are
reported with the degree of acceptance varying from highest to lowest as follows: biology,
biological anthropology, developmental psychology, and cultural anthropology. These variations
are related to the central concepts of each subdiscipline.

This paper details the results of an
investigation into the rates of acceptance of some of sociobiology’s key
concepts in the subdisciplines of animal
behavior, cultural anthropology, developmental psychology, and biological anthropology. We are not concerned here with assessing the
empirical correctness of the concepts.!
We limit ourselves to examining the sociocultural diffusion and acceptance of
the concepts across four academic subdisciplines whose members are acquainted with sociobiology’s key concepts and have actively debated the
conceptual and social issues raised by
their usage.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE QUESTIONNAIRE
During 1984 and 1985, a question

and Sociobiology, General Hal] Publisher.

pying the response categories described below. The questionnaire was
in the form of a booklet titled “Viewpoints About Human Sociobiology.”
Its stated purpose was to gather information helpful in describing and understanding the emerging diversity of
viewpoints on sociobtology. Respondents were asked to address the following question: “To what degree do you
think each of the following sociobiological concepts might be useful in future research on human behavior?”
Answers were on a five-point Likert
scale including ‘“‘very useful, useful,
undecided, probably not useful, very
unlikely to be useful.”

A study by Cathey and Brown
(1986), addressing a related set of concerns, sent a questionnaire to 111 faculty at Michigan State University and
received 88 returns, 79 per cent. About
52 per cent (31 of 59) of the responses
agreed that sociobiology is a scientific
discipline within biology, and 73 per
cent (32 of 44) agreed that it is a con
troversial area as applied to humans.

The 88 respondents were members of
departments of Anthropology, Social
Science, Sociology, Psychology, Natural Science, and Zoology. The present
study adds to the findings of Cathey
and Brown by being based on a total of
1,631 persons in four subdisciplines
situated in three types of educational
institutions: those granting the Ph.D.
degree, those four- and five-year uniwversities granting the Master’s and/or
SBachelor’s degree, and two-year comsSmunity colleges granting the Associate
‘cof Arts or Science degree. The size of
Sthe populations and the frequency of
Aresponses allows us to compare subdisSciplines at the three institutions and
make inferences about their differ“ences in relation to the central conScepts of each subdiscipline.?
‘= The four concepts whose usefulness
-=Wwas evaluated were as follows: kin setection, reciprocal altruism, maleZfemale reproduction strategy, and the
sgenetic basis for altruism. Kin selection
“Zand reciprocal altruism have become
the most widely known of the concepts
Sof sociobiology. Kin selection refers to
paction at some cost to ego which favors
the fertility of siblings, cousins, and
Sother collateral kin to the degree that
Sthey carry ego’s genes. Sociobiologists
zassume that genetic similarity is known
Qor recognizable and that there are genetic predispositions for such altruistic
behavior (Hamilton, 1964; Wilson,
1975). Reciprocal altruism occurs

7An alternative hypothese which will be reported in the above book concerns whether the respondent’s knowledge of sociobiological concepts
influences acceptance of them. Briefly stated, crosstabulation of self-reported familiarity with acceptance of the concepts is far less productive than is
the relationship to the subdisciplines. Kind of activity (such as research, publishing, teaching, etc.)
shows a somewhat stronger relationship, but the discipline is still the more powerful explanatory tool.

when ego, acting at some personal
cost, favors the fertility of nonkin in
the expectation of future reciprocity
(Trivers, 1971). Male-female reproduction strategy refers to a wide variety of behaviors resulting in copulatory
access to persons of the opposite sex,
but also involving care and differential
survival of offspring (Trivers, 1971;
Gray, 1985). The genetic basis of altruism is an essential assumption, since
sociobiology is derived from evolutionary biology with its keystone concept
that natural selection modifies gene
frequencies. We propose that the perceived utility of each of these concepts
will vary with the central concepts of
each of the four subdisciplines in this
Study.

THE SAMPLE

The rates of returned and usable
questionnaires from the study’s various
subdisciplines are as follows:

Biologists specializing in animal behavior: Eighty-one per cent (147) of
specialists in animal behavior teaching
in Ph.D.-granting departments and 57

‘per cent (111) of specialists working in

four- and five-year institutions returned
usable questionnaires. Both of these
populations were random selections
from the membership list of the Animal
Behavior Society. Usable questionnaires were returned from 47 per cent
(154) of the mailing to community colleges. Letters were addressed to Instructor of Biology. The community colleges
selected were from the Directory of the
American Association of Community
and Junior Colleges if the full-time faculty numbered 50 with 1,000 or more
students and if they were located in or
adjacent to a county of 50,000 or more
population.

Biological anthropologists: Usable
replies were received from 71 per cent
(147) of biological anthropologists in
Ph.D.-granting departments and from
66 per cent (123) of those located in
four-year schools. These two populations were the product of mailing the
questionnaire to all persons listing either biological or physical anthropology as a specialty area in Guide to Departments of Anthropology of the
American Anthropological Association (1983-84, 1984-85). Following
the same procedure outlined in the
preceding paragraph above, we received a return of 29 per cent (95) from
teachers of biological anthropology at
community colleges.

Cultural anthropologists: Sixty-nine
per cent (151) of those listed in the
above cited Guide and teaching in the
Ph.D.-granting departments returned
usable replies, as did 70 per cent (197)
of those at four-year institutions.
Members of these two groups listed
their specialty area as cultural anthropology in the Guide. Usable replies
were received by 22 per cent (74) of
our mailing to teachers of cultural anthropology at community colleges.

Developmental psychologists: Eighty-four per cent (197) of those in
Ph.D.-granting departments, and 52
per cent (101) at Bachelor’s and/or
Master’s-granting institutions provided
usable replies, both populations being
randomly selected from those developmental psychologists listed in the membership directory (1985) of the American Psychological Association. Usable
replies were received from 40 per cent
(134) of our mailing to teachers of introductory psychology at two-year colleges.

Social Biology

The responding population, then, is
comprised of 412 biologists, 365 biological anthropologists, 432 developmental psychologists, and 422 cultural
anthropologists, for a total of 1,631
persons.

RESULTS

The frequency of acceptance of sociobiological concepts, as seen in Table
1, is highest among biologists, second
highest among biological anthropologists, followed by developmental psychologists, with the lowest rates recorded for cultural anthropologists.
The reverse order applies to the degree
of disagreement with the future utility
of the concepts. There is a striking consistency of response within disciplines.

At Ph.D.-granting departments, the
largest total agreement on the future
utility of the four core concepts (Table
2, total for concepts 1-4) for research
is among biologists specializing in animal behavior (72 per cent). The second
highest mean frequency of agreement
occurs among biological anthropologists (58 per cent). Developmental psychologists recorded an intermediate
agreement rate (43 per cent), while the
lowest agreement rate is among cultural anthropologists (32 per cent).

The frequency of disagreement
rates illustrates a reverse pattern. The
largest mean frequency of disagreement is found among cultural anthropologists; the next highest level of disagreement is among developmental
psychologists, then biological anthropologists. The lowest mean frequency
of disagreement is recorded for biologists.

 
 

Vol. 39, No. 1-2

A high degree of pro-sociobiological consensus in each discipline is indicated when a majority of its respondents agree that the four core concepts
are useful research tools. Such a degree of consensus is found among animal behaviorists at all three types of
educational institutions where all four
concepts are favored by a clear majority. Three of the four basic concepts

truism, and the genetic basis of altruism. Skepticism about the genetic basis
of altruism was indicated by the undecided or disagree responses which
ranged from an overall average of
about 40 per cent in animal behavior to
75 per cent in cultural anthropology. In
the Cathey and Brown (1986) study a
related question asked whether the respondent believed that “innate” behavior is common in humans. Half the
respondents in the six disciplines,
taken as a unit, were neutral or did not
know, and another large portion were
neutral or did not know. The data reported here clarify the variation on this
kind of issue by discipline with the
same order reported for the overall
pattern in the opening paragraph of
this section. It is remarkable that responses from Ph.D. and BA/MA institutions in each subdiscipline on the
four concepts are very close together,
except at the Ph.D.-level in anthropology. The largest and most consistent
degree of difference (ranging from 9
per cent to 17 per cent) is found between those two institutional types on
the one hand and two-year colleges on
the other. Among biologists and biological anthropologists, those teaching
at two-year schools tend to be less accepting of sociobiological concepts,
but among cultural anthropologists
and developmental psychologists those
teaching at junior colleges are more accepting of these same concepts.

ethology, is a subdiscipline of biology.

havior. By contrast sociobiology is concerned only with social behavior. Origins of the study of behavior as an expression of instincts ts attributed to
Lorenz (1937), the founder of ethology
in Europe, who believed that different
behaviors could be studied and explained as if they were like organs of
the body. Lorenz placed the behaviors
he observed in an evolutionary perspective. The concepts of sociobiology
were derived from evolutionary theory, also known as the modern synthesis (Fisher, 1930; Wright, 1931;
Huxley, 1942), andfromethology(Hamilton, 1964; Trivers, 1971). Wilson
(1975) referred to this as the new synthesis. The modern synthesis is the conceptual foundation embraced by much
of modern biology and physical anthropology. The extent of the adoption of
the new synthesis is the topic of this paper.

The very high percentages of support for the first three concepts (Table
1) is closely related to the conceptual
focus shared by biologists. These three
concepts are supported at Ph.D. and
BA/MA institutions by 76 per cent or
more of respondents. By contrast, support for the “‘genetic basis of altruism
ranges” from 53 per cent to 66 per
cent. This lower frequency of acceptance may result from the view that
identifying genetic bases for altruism is
impossible or very difficult; or it may
be that the respondents believe that
the central theorems of sociobiology
can and should be tested without reference to genes (see Barash, 1977).

If ‘kin selection” is derived from
the modern evolutionary theory which
biologists support, why do not 100 per
cent of animal behaviorists support it?
Part of the resistance may trace back to

 

Social Biology

the recognition that its genetic basis is
assumed, but difficult to prove. Resistance may also relate to the debate in
the 1950’s in which some animal behavlorists and psychologists challenged
Lorenz’ emphasis on innate response
patterns and the neglect of learning
theory (Beach, 1955; Schneirla, 1956).
Most simply, there may also be an
avoidance of controversy among some
biologists, and the feeling that sociobiologists .claam too much explanatory
power in regard to the behavior of the
human species.

Cultural anthropology is the largest
branch of anthropology. The discipline
has been committed to three central
concepts: race, culture, and evolution
(Stocking, 1968). But the degree of
commitment to these concepts varies.
There is a duality in the cultural
branch, where the central concept is
culture, but it views itself as being holistic in also embracing the biological
nature of humankind. For many cultural anthropologists, the synthesis of
biological and cultural evolution holds
that biological evolution made human
intelligence, language, and culture
possible, but does not determine their
diversity (Leeds, 1977; Sahlins, 1976).
Further, once complex human culture
was possible it became the major mode
of adaptation, reducing the likelihood
of biological adaptation, with exceptions being recognized, but stress being
placed on how culture alters gene frequencies such as in the case of the
sickle cell allele (Livingstone, 1958).
Given this emphasis, it is no surprise
that cultural anthropologists respond
least favorably (Table 1) to sociobiological concepts which claim to explain
an ever-expanding variety of human
behaviors from rape to who accompaVol. 39, No. 1-2

nies whom to the shopping mall. Cultural anthropologists are concerned
with the anthropomorphism, ethnocentrism, and social Darwinism that
they perceive in the concepts and scenarios of human sociobiology (Leeds,
1977).

Despite these concerns, sociobiology has won a number of adherents
from the ranks of cultural anthropol
ogy (Chagnon and Irons, 1979; DickSemann, 1979; Silk, 1980). Harris
5(1979) does not attribute this to the
‘gstrength of sociobiological theory, but
Srather to the Jack of agreement on a
Apowerful and coherent theory of culSture (see Ortner, 1984). Harris sug+gests cultural materialism with an eco“logical focus as a source for that
Scoherence (see also Bennett, 1976;
‘SCampbell, 1983; Foley, 1987).
Biological anthropology is today
=concerned with human variation and
evolution, but it had its origin in the
pstudy of race by eighteenth-century zoZologists (Boas, 1904). Early in this cenztury, its practitioners, mostly from
SHarvard, came to be incorporated into
pemerging anthropology departments
zheaded by students of Franz Boas at
Columbia (Spencer, 1981, 1982; CraEvens, 1978). Partly as a result of their
Straining at Harvard and the influence
Aof their new departmental colleagues,
they maintained a dual interest in biology and culture. But biological theory claimed their primary allegiance,
especially after the introduction of the
modern synthesis in the 1950’s. In the
1940’s, Montagu (1941, 1942) was already using that synthesis to challenge
the race concept. Biological anthropologists in the 1960’s began to take up
that challenge, and by 1985 only half of
faculty at Ph.D. institutions continued

8

to accept the view that races exist in
the species Homo sapiens (Lieberman
et al., 1989).

This degree of change in rejecting
race relates to several factors: There
was recognition of clinal data establishing that racial boundaries are very difficult to identify because of the discordant geographical distribution of
human hereditary traits (Montagu,
1941; Livingstone, 1962; Brace, 1964);
there was the social climate of the
1960’s and 1970's challenging a concept
that supported inegalitarian views (Littlefield, et al., 1982); there was an infusion into the discipline of persons
from backgrounds of lesser privilege
(Lieberman and Reynolds, 1978); and
there was the expansion of several
fields of research (Garn, 1982) such as
paleontology, primate behavior, and
molecular evolution. The use of evolutionary biological concepts, and the
utility of these concepts in regard to
primate behavior and hominid evolution made the concepts of sociobiology, which were also derived from evolutionary biology, seem very
promising. The challenge to the culture
concept may also have seemed less important because culture was fess central to some biological anthropologists.

Some of the lack of support for sociobiological concepts relates to the
perception by Washburn (1980) that
the concept of kin selection provides a
biological explanation for racism, with
some radical right groups in Europe
having already taken advantage of that
potential (see Barker, 1982).3 A more
general caution is provided by Konner
(1982) who warns of the “dangers of
behavioral biology” and the role

3For an opposing view, see Barkow (1980).

166 Brief Reports

played by biological anthropology in
supporting racism and eugenics in the
United States and Germany in the
past. Konner (1982, p. 445) believes it
is healthy and understandable that anthropologists ‘“‘are resisting the new
currents of biological determinism.”’
Another source of resistance among
sociobiological anthropologists (Tanner and Zihlman, 1976), is the continuing acceptance by sociobiologists of the
scenario of “man, the hunter’ as an
adequate explanation for aggression
and a male-dominated division of labor
(see Wilson, 1978).

Developmental psychology is a major subdiscipline of psychology. It can
trace its ancestry to Darwin, Haeckel,
Freud, and Piaget. It draws upon and
contributes to such fields as behavior
genetics and ethology. Developmental
psychology is defined in one text as
“the scientific discipline concerned
with describing age-related changes in
the behavior and mental processes of
both humans and animals and then explaining how nature and nurture
through their interactions produce
these changes” (McGraw, 1988, p. 6).
Darwin’s theory, Haeckel’s idea that
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, and
the search for the origins of adult behavior patterns in the roots of early
childhood entered into the origin of developmental psychology. The field also
had its origin in the nature-nurture issue, which Richard Lerner (1976) refers to as “the core conceptual issue”
of developmental psychology.*

‘The nature-nurture issue boiled over in 1976
when 50 psychologists and other scientists signed a
letter deploring the situation in which “‘it ts virtually
heresy to. . . recommend further study of the biological bases of behavior."* The response and debate
that followed is in Tobach and Proshansky (1976).

Social Biology

The nature-nurture controversy embroiled developmentalists “only 30
years ago”’ (Shaffer, 1989, p. 102), but
“the prevailing contemporary viewpoint is that developmental changes in
human behavior result from genetic
and environmental factors acting together, with each playing a crucial
role” (Friedrich and Van Horn, 1976,
p. 6, emphasis added). This dual emphasis on nature and nurture interacting involves utilizing a:

holistic perspective . . . that emphasizes
the important interrelationships among
the physical, mental, social, and emotional aspects of human development

.. and a theoretical eclecticism involving psychoanalytic, behavioristic, cognitive-developmental, information pro
cessing, ethological and behavior
genetic viewpoints. . . . (Shaffer, 1989,
v1).

Given this emphasis on the relationship of nature and nurture, it is unexpected that the mean for acceptance of
the four core sociobiological concepts
is only 43 per cent, especially given the
holistic, eclectic, and interactionist
credo of developmental psychology.

Some light is cast on this by Shaffer
(1989, p. 39) who lists five basic questions posed by the theories of developmental psychology: (1) Is human nature inherently good or bad? (2) Is
human development influenced primarly by nature or nurture? (3) Is the
child an active or a passive recipient of
social and biological influences? (4) Is
development a continuous process or
are there more abrupt shifts from stage
to stage? (5) Are there unusual paths
that children follow in development? If
the theories differ, should we not expect developmental psychologists to
differ? For example, one textbook au 

Vol. 39, No. 1-2

thor states: “This book strives to
present a particular point of view on
human development—that is, human
development is determined in large
measure by biological factors; commonly, these interact with environmental and social factors. This interaction is not denied” (Nash, 1978, p. 1).
We can expect that other developmental psychologists would lean the other
way, and some would claim balance,
Sand others would state that it depends
aon the phenomena studied at a given
oint in time.

In a paper concerning the relationship of sociobiology to topics in human
Cdevelopment, Smith (1987) stresses the
simportance of concepts of inclusive fit“hess, kin investment, evolutionary sta“ple Strategy, learning rules, geneSulture transmissions. But he then
-zBtates that “‘evolutionary thinking has
snot had a major impact on mainstream
sdevelopmental research” (1987, p.
2238). Smith attributes this to several
‘wpbstacles, Or misconceptions, about so_ciobiological explanation including the
5‘feeling” that: (1) Evolutionary forces
sdo not adequately explain contemposary human developments. (2) Evolutionary explanations are not compatiple with traditional views such as
Aearning theory. (3) Cognition, learnGing, and culture are far more important

for human development than is the
case for any other animal. (4) Evolutionary explanations can apply to simpler reflexes but not more complex be

haviors. (5) Evolutionary concepts emphasize individual “genetic differences.”’ (6) Evolutionary views assume
that environmental intervention to improve conditions is limited to biology.
(7) That few gene-to-behavior pathways have been traced in humans.

CONCLUSION

The fact that there is no prevailing
emphasis on one or the other side of
the nature-nurture issue in developmental psychology contrasts with the
éxistence of such a commitment in biology, biological anthropology, and
cultural anthropology, and it also relates to the pattern of responses in
which the highest frequency of undecided answers is generally found
among developmental psychologists.
To the extent that the developmental
psychologists in our sample Jean in one
direction, they lean away from the concepts of sociobiology. That puts them
in the company of cultural anthropologists who also reject sociobiological
concepts, but do so more emphatically.
Cultural anthropology is a social science subdiscipline. Animal behaviorists
and biological anthropologists represent natural science subdisciplines. Developmental psychology is lodged between the natural and social sciences.
This pattern as much as any other may
explain the acceptance rates presented
here.
