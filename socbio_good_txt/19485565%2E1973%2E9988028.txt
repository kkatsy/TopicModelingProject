Erratum and Further Analysis: “Perinatal

 

Conditions and Infant Development in

Children with Schizophrenic Parents’

In a recent issue of Social Biology, Mednick, Mura, Schulsinger, and Mednick
(1971, Vol. 18, Suppl., p. $103-S113)
presented a preliminary study of the “Perinatal Conditions and Infant Development in
Children with Schizophrenic Parents.” In
this study, we indicated that a significantly
greater number of “Other” complications
was suffered by the Schizophrenic Parent
Group than the Character Disorder or
Normal Parent Groups. The significance
was tested with y?; the noted y? was 9.48
(4 df, p<.0.05). Since publication, two
problems have developed regarding this preliminary study.

The first is that the y? for ‘Other’
complications was found to be in error. Instead of the reported result, the y? was
found to be 7.87 (4 df, p < 0.10). As stated
in the article, the bulk of the difference
between the groups in the “Other” complications category was contributed by the
variable, birth weight. The other variables
included in the “Other” complications scale
reduced rather than enhanced the difference
between the groups. Therefore, the authors
decided to investigate the birth weight
variable alone.

The second problem concerns the matching criteria employed in the study as reported in Table 1 of the original publication.
The Parent Groups were drawn from Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. At the time of this
study, admission to Rigshospitalet was restricted to unwed mothers and cases with anticipated severe pregnancy and/or delivery
difficulties. Thus, if a given Parent Group
had a surplus of unwed mothers (admitted
for social reasons and typically young and
healthy), we would expect (and empirically
found) fewer PBCs in that group. In view
of this, the entire analysis is currently being
repeated with the Parent Groups matched
for marital status in addition to the other
seven matching variables. Matching for
marital status yielded 32 married and 52
unmarried in each Parent Group. The other
matching variables in Table 1 remained
essentially unchanged. For purposes of this
note, we analyzed the differences in birthweights between the children of the Schizophrenic Parent Group (mean = 3,053.5
grams) and the children of the Control
Parent Group (mean = 3,263.2 grams).
The difference was significant (f= 2.35,
168 df, p<.0.01).

Symposium on the Human Genetic Load

A symposium entitled “What Is Happening to Gene Frequencies in Man?” will be
held in Atlanta, Georgia, on October 24,
1973. It will be sponsored jointly by the
American Society of Human Genetics and
by the Society for the Study of Social Biology. The symposium will be held on the
opening evening of the annual meeting of
the first society and in connection with the
annual business meeting of the second
society.

Barring late changes, the symposium program will include: “Medical Implications
of the Genetic Load,” W. J. Schull “Exposure of Modern Populations to Mutagenic
Agents,” H. E. Sutton; “Anticipated Effects
of Carrier Detection, Intrauterine Diagnosis, and Reproductive Compensation,” G. R.
Fraser.
