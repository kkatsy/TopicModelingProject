ABSTRACT: This paper investigates gender differences in the timing of ischemic heart disease
(IHD) mortality among white Americans. Three age-at-death groupings are examined, using a
model incorporating three types of independent variables: lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and
biology/heredity. Logistic regression techniques are used to analyze National Mortality Followback Survey data. Three hypotheses drawn from the literature are tested: (1) that IHD mortality
risks will vary by gender and across the life course; (2) that the independent variables will exert
a lower mortality risk for women than for men at all ages of death; and (3) that differential risks
by gender will be larger for younger age-at-death groups. Findings support the first and third
hypotheses. The importance of research on gender differentials in age at IHD mortality in
relation to parental heart-attack mortality, smoking and spousal smoking, occupation, and

fertility is highlighted.

In the low mortality regimes of developed countries, women outlive men
by a substantial, although variable,
margin. The sex difference in life expectancy at birth in developed countries ranges from 9 years (in the former
USSR) to 4.5 years (in Greece). In the
United States the figure is 7.5 years
(United Nations, 1988). Diseases of
the circulatory system account for
nearly one-half of the sex difference in
life expectancy at birth, and ischemic
heart disease (IHD) for approximately
one-third. In addition, about 63 per
cent of the increase in the sex mortality
differential in the U.S. between 1900
and 1982 resulted from trends in death
due to circulatory disease! (United Nations, 1988). While differential life expectancy by sex has been decreasing
within a number of age groups in North

1The figure for IHD mortality is not available.

America in the last decade (Gee and
Veevers, 1988; Waldron, 1993), sex
mortality differentials in deaths due to
heart disease continue to remain substantial and, as yet, there are no indications of a narrowing (Waldron,
1993).

A combination of social, psychosocial, and biological factors—and
their interactions—are considered to
account for women’s greater life expectancy in general (i.e., for all causes
of death), although biological risks
are considered to be of overall lesser
importance (e.g., Koskenvuo et al.,
1986; Verbrugge, 1985). A number of
findings are well-established—for example, only a few causes of death
(IHD, lung cancer, and deaths due to
accidents/violence) are primarily responsible for the sex difference in longevity, and that about one-half of the
sex differential in (adult) mortality in
general and in IHD mortality specifi

cally is attributable to smoking (Waldron, 1986a). Findings on other possible determinants of the sex difference
in deaths due to IHD —such as the protective effect of female sex hormones
(Kalin and Zumoff, 1990) and the role
of Type A behavioral patterns (Barker
et al., 1984; Waldron, 1986b)—are
more ambiguous.

This paper investigates gender dif£ ferences in mortality, but with a differa ent focus than most research on the
8 topic. Typically, efforts are directed
€ toward establishing the factors that de3 termine the magnitude of the sex morA 5, tality differential. We are less interS ested in accounting for the differential
~. per se than in ascertaining if mortality
— determinants operate in the same way
S ‘for female and male mortality across
5, S the life course. For example,. are fac= tors x, y, and z equally “risky” for
= men and women? And, do these dif«= ferential risks vary with age at death?
2 These questions are particularly relef © vant given the substantial changes oc2 = curring in the female gender role, such
5 as shifts in labor-force participation
>and work-related stress.

Ultimately, all research on sex dif'S ferentials in dying in developed countries seeks to answer the question:
= Why do women live longer than men?
© Without denying the complexities of
attempting to answer this question,
one finds research has not progressed
significantly beyond broad generalities. In 1986, Waldron stated “much
remains to be discovered about the
multiple interacting causes of sex differences in mortality” (p. 74). While
this statement is as true now as it was
then, research on differential mor
ed b

ownloa

tality in developed countries has, in recent years, shifted its focus away from

Ischemic Heart Disease

111

gender to social-class/socioeconomic
differences.”

We suggest two reasons for the current “standstill” in the explication of
mortality differences by gender. One is
a looseness in the operationalization of
the dependent variable. As pointed out
by Pollard (1983), mortality rates and
survivorship (or life expectancy or longevity) measure different aspects of
death, although they are related in
nontrivial ways. If one is attempting to
explain or account for gender differences in longevity, the appropriate
measure is one based on age at death
(or years until death). However, researchers of sex differences in longevity sometimes use the rate of dying
(i.e., women’s lower mortality rates
[for most causes of death]) as a proxy
or equivalent measure (e.g., Harrison,
1978; Hoyenga and Hoyenga, 1979;
Solomon, 1981; Sutherland et al.,
1990). The linking of a mortality measure with its corresponding conceptualization of death is an important,
albeit complicated, issue as inappropriate measures can lead to misleading
conclusions.

A second reason is that limited research has been devoted to gender
differences in cause-specific mortality
risk factors. An exception is the work
of Wingard and her colleagues (e.g.,
Wingard, 1982; Wingard et al., 1983).
As noted by Waldron (1986b), Wingard reports inconsistent findings

across studies, attributable in part to

A library search of research done in the past
five years on mortality differentials in developed
countries revealed a preponderance of work on socioeconomic differences. Examples include: Committee for International Cooperation in National
Research in Demography, 1991; Mare, 1990; Marmot, 1989; Nolan, 1990; Wilkins et al., 1989; and
Wing, 1988.

nonrepresentative samples. Another
exception is research done as part of
the Framingham Study. While the
Framingham research has examined
male and female risk for various types
of heart disease and mortality, its biomedical framework often precludes
the examination of social or lifestyle
variables?—except smoking—and its
focus is not on gender differences per
se (e.g., Stokes, 1987). However, until
we know about the possible “‘gender
-ing”’ of risk factors (e.g., are smoking,

low SES, etc., as “risky” for women as
for men?), we will not progress in our
understanding of gender differences
in dying from IHD. An examination
of risk factors is particularly important
in IHD mortality, since gender differences in IHD prognosis are small
(Waldron, 1986).

This research examines male-female
differences in the timing of death due
to IHD among white Americans. Specifically, we seek to ascertain if, and
to what degree, the factors associated
with dying from IHD earlier versus
Jater in life are similar for men and
women. As the concern is with explicating longevity (survivorship) differentials, our mortality measure, age at
death, is appropriate. The data source
used—the National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS) (see following
section)—contains a relatively large,
representative sample and a number of
independent variables for testing.

The choice to limit the investigation
to one cause of death, IHD, is based on
a number of considerations. One, we
assume that different causes of death

3Research based on the Framingham Study (and
its Offspring Study) is increasingly examining social
variables, but gender is not a major focus (e.g., Garrison et al., 1993).

Social Biology

(due to natural causes) have different
configurations of causal variables; to
include all causes of death, in an attempt to account for women’s later age
at death, is to chance obscuring effects
that counterbalance one another. Two,
heart disease is the major cause of
death for both men and women in the
United States; hence, findings related
to this cause of death will be more explicative of the overall sex difference in
longevity than those for any other natural cause of death. Three, heart disease has tended to be ignored by social
scientists interested in sex differences
in longevity and/or mortality (exceptions include Wingard et al., 1983;
Johnson, 1977). The putative role of
sex hormones in determining gender
differences in heart disease mortality
appears to have deterred nonbiological
researchers from studying this cause of
death. Four, research on predictors of
death due to heart disease performed
by biomedical researchers has tended
to examine men only (exceptions include Schildkraut et al., 1989; Stokes
et al., 1987), presumably because premature death due to heart disease is
more common among men. As a result
of three and four above, there is little
research-informed knowledge about
sex differences in age at death due to
heart disease.

In attempting to account for age at
death due to IHD for men and for
women and, in particular, the degree
of similarity or dissimilarity in the
predictor variables by sex, we adopt a
model containing three types of variables: lifestyle* variables, socioeco
“Our use of the term lifestyle does not imply an
“individual-responsibility” approach to health.
That is, we acknowledge the social and economic
environment which both creates some lifestyle be
 
 

Vol. 41, No. 1-2

nomic status (SES), and _ biological/
hereditary variables. The lifestyle
variables examined are smoking, spousal smoking, drinking, and exercise.
Smoking is clearly linked to gender differences in heart disease mortality
(Waldron, 1986, Wingard, 1983).
While smoking by a spouse has been
explored less, Garland et al. (1985) report elevated IHD mortality in neversmoking women aged 50-79 whose
Sihusbands smoke or had smoked. The
consumption of alcohol is less consisE tently linked with heart disease mortalDity, but, as stated by Epstein (1989,
$203) “it is nevertheless likely that
Sdrinking habits reflect patterns of
~- lifestyle that are relevant to the prob—lem [of coronary heart disease].”
“Further, research has demonstrated a
S J-shaped curve in the distribution of
THD mortality and alcohol consumpS tion, wherein heavy drinkers, followed
‘sby light drinkers or nondrinkers, apepear to have a higher mortality risk
than moderate drinkers (Marmot et
Zal., 1989). Other studies even show
~ a health benefit associated with moderate alcohol consumption (for a regview of research findings, see BaumSBaicker, 1985). Physical activity or
exercise has also been reported as a
= correlate of longevity (e.g., Blair et al.,
1989, Paffenbarger et al., 1986). While
it is not clear whether exercise affects
the quality of life more than its quantity (O’Brien and Vertinsky, 1991),
there is enough evidence to justify its
inclusion in our analysis.
SES is measured by occupation. Although not our operationalization of

cussion of methodological issues regarding SES measurement), an association between heart disease mortality
and occupation has been reported
(e.g., Marmot, 1989; Wing, 1988), as
has a relationship between female
labor-force participation and the sex
differential in mortality (Pampel and
Zimmer, 1989).

The set of biological/hereditary
variables contains three indicators.
One is parental death due to IHD.
Family history is a widely accepted risk
factor for heart disease, but its role as
a factor independent of other risks that
family members tend to share has been
questioned (Perkins, 1986). Findings
from the Framingham study suggest
that parental death due to heart disease is an independent factor for both
women and men (Schildkraut et al.,
1989). The second variable is body
mass, since weight is an acknowledged
risk factor in heart disease (e.g., Higgins et al., 1988; Kannel et al., 1976;
Negri et al., 1992). It is possible that
the distribution of body weight (‘‘apple” vs. “pear”? shape) is more important than actual weight itself (Wingard,
1990). However, such a measure is not
available in the NMFS. The third variable is fertility (among women only).
It is included as an exploratory variable, particularly to see if childlessness
(and/or bearing large numbers of children) which has physiological dimensions in many cases, is linked to IHD
mortality, especially at young ages.
Childlessness has been found to be
related to sudden coronary death in
women (Talbot et al., 1989).

Our working hypotheses are that:
(1) IHD mortality risks will vary by
gender and across the life course;
(2) the independent variables (except

114 Wister and Gee

fertility) will exert a lower IHD mortality risk for women than for men at
all ages of death; and (3) differential
risks by gender will be larger for
younger ages of death. The first hypothesis is based on research suggesting that mortality risks vary by gender.
The second hypothesis is guided by research that demonstrates no narrowing
of sex mortality differentials due to
IHD even in the face of decreasing
gender differences in important mortality determinants such as smoking
(Waldron, 1993). The third hypothesis
is based on a general finding that the
major risk factors predictive of cardiovascular mortality lessen with advancing age (Davis, 1990).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS

The data used are a subset drawn
from the 1986 National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS), conducted
by the Department of Health and Human Services. The NMFS contains
18,733 records, gathered from the Current Mortality Sample (CMS), of resident U.S. adults aged 25 or more who
died in 1986. The CMS comprises a systematic sample of 10 per cent of the
death certificates from each state except Oregon. Oregon did not participate in the NMFS due to state legislation regarding consent of survey
respondents. Washington, D.C., and
New York City are also excluded,
given separate death registration in
those areas.

The NMFS links information taken
from the death certificate with data obtained from an “informant” (a relative
or close friend of the decedent), the

 

Social Biology

latter of which includes information
about potential risk factors that may
have contributed to the death. There
are a total of 16,598 cases linking these
two sources of information; and the response rate for the informant questionnaires was 89 per cent. Multiple causeof-death data were also linked to this
data set, since 99.9 per cent of cases
contained multiple cause-of-death information.

This study is based on cases in which
IHD (ICD codes 412~414 [ninth rev.])
was indicated as the main cause of
death on the death certificate and
where race was reported as white on
the death certificate and in the informant file. A small number of persons
with inconsistent information on gender across the files were also removed.
This results in a total unweighted sample of 2,955 IHD decedents; 1,656 men
(56 per cent) and 1,299 women (44 per
cent.)

MEASUREMENT OF DEPENDENT AND
INDEPENDENT VARIABLES

The dependent variable is age at
death due to IHD, which indicates the
timing of death due to ischemic heart
disease. Since age-at-death data are
sensitive to life cycle and cohort effects, our initial step involved dividing
the IHD decedents into four age-atdeath groups: (1) those who died very
young—25 to 44 years of age; (2) those
who died during mid-life—45 to 64
years of age; (3) those who died as
young elderly—65 to 79 years of age;
and (4) those who died as old elderly
—8&Q years of age and over. The number of IHD decedents in these four
groups, by sex, is provided in Table 1.
From these groups, three dichotomous
dependent variables were developed to

independent variables is provided in
.2 Table 2, including the reference cate~ gory for each variable for the logistic

S straightforward, although some discussion of the SES measure (occupation)
=is warranted. Our preference is an edAucation measure, as education is the
single best SES indicator in relation to
the risk of cardiovascular disease (Winkleby et al., 1992). However, the characteristics of our sample result in a negative relationship between age at death
and education. Specifically, education
is a co-variate of age at death. Age
strongly affects level of completed education (a cohort effect) and level of
education affects age at death. If we
had data on survivors as well as dece
Ischemic Heart Disease

115

dents, we could have performed an
analysis (e.g., event history analysis,
proportional hazards analysis) which
would remove the potent cohort effects
of educational attainment. As we lack
such data, we are forced to adopt an
SES measure, based on occupation of
longest duration, that is less susceptible to cohort effects.

DaTa ANALYSIS

Logistic regression techniques are
used to investigate differences in the
ability of the independent variables to
predict the timing of IHD deaths in the
lives of men and women. As indicated
above, age at death due to IHD was
dichotomized for the purpose of conducting logistic regression analyses of
very young IHD decedents (ages 2544/remaining); young decedents; (ages
25-64/remaining); and very old decedents (ages 80+/remaining). In this
way, we are comparing the independent variables across gender in their
ability to predict dying from IHD very
early (versus later), early (versus
later), and very late (versus earlier) in
life. A comparison between one of the
two mid-age at death groups (i.e., ages
44-64 or 65-79) would prove problematic, since we would be combining ageat-death groups that are both younger
and older than the middle age-at-death
group.

Logistic regression is a multivariate
technique that is well suited to predicting a binary dependent variable from a
set of independent variables. It requires fewer assumptions than other
models, such as discriminant analysis,
that also attempt to estimate the probability that an event occurs. The logistic coefficient, its standard error, and
odds ratio are presented. The logistic

coefficient can be interpreted as the
change in the log odds of death due to
IHD associated with a one-unit change
in the independent variable. The odds
of an event occurring (in this case, dying from IHD) are defined as the ratio
of the probability that it will occur to
the probability that it will not. When a
coefficient is negative, the odds of dying from IHD are below one (even
odds) but never reach zero; when a coefficient is positive, the odds ratio is
above singularity. Goodness-of-fit chiSquare is provided for the full models
along with a test for statistical significance. If a chi-square is not statistically
significant, it does not differ significantly from a “perfect”? model using
the independent variables in the
model.

The independent variables that are
not binary are grouped into three categories (except occupation; see below), with the middle one treated as
the reference or contrast category.
(The reference groups are indicated in
Table 2. The coefficient for the reference category is zero.) The odds ratio
for the first category of a variable indicates the change in log odds when
comparing this category to the middle
or contrast group. The same logic can
be applied to the other contrast.

The occupation variable contains
three categories for men and four for
women. For women, a homemaker/
student category is added to the three
variable classes that apply to both genders: blue collar/agriculture; white
collar/service; and professional/mana
-gerial. The contrast group for both

female and male decedents is white
collar/service (see Table 2). The odds
ratio is therefore interpreted as the
probability of dying from IHD for a

 

Ischemic Heart Disease

 

117

specific occupational category compared to the white collar/service industry category.

DATA LIMITATIONS

A number of data limitations which
can affect the results and their interpretation can be identified. One major
concern is that all of the independent
variables in the NMFS are obtained by
proxy (i.e., informants or decedents).
The information provided by proxies
varies depending on the degree of
closeness of the informant to the decedent and the ability of the respondent
to recall information, some of which
relates to events distant in time. Both
affect the accuracy of the informant’s
information, which cannot be validated. Missing data is a related issue.
Logistic regression allows only for
the listwise deletion of missing data.
Therefore, missing data are added
to the contrast category group for
multiple-category variables, and coded
as zero for binary variables. This is the
most conservative way of dealing with
missing data and still retain sample
size. A third concern is the absence
of control groups, i.e., persons in the
same age groups who are alive. The
lack of information on both decedents
and survivors does not allow for the
elimination of cohort effects, as discussed in the measurement of our SES
variable. Furthermore, predictors of
age at IHD death may not necessarily
correspond with predictors of survival.

RESULTS

Table 1 indicates the relationship
between age at death due to IHD and
gender in the NMFS sample. Nearly
one-half of IHD male deaths occur at

ages under 65, whereas IHD deaths
among women are concentrated at the
older ages. The median age at death
due to this cause differs by 11 years between men and women.

Given the association between IHD
mortality and gender, results are discussed separately for the three age-atdeath groups. Within each group, the
discussion is ordered so that the variables displaying the largest odds ratios
(for women, men, or both) are discussed first.

For both men and women, the
strongest predictor of very early versus
later death due to IHD is parental
death from a heart attack (see Table
3). This result confirms other studies
reporting that parental death due to
heart disease is a predictor of heart disease mortality for both sexes, particularly mortality at young ages (e.g.,
Schildkraut et al., 1989). However, the
magnitude of the relationship for both
men and women is striking. The odds
ratio for women is more than double
that for any other variable; for men,
the odds ratio is larger than for heavy
cigarette smoking.

The odds ratios and B’s in Table 3
show the strength of a relationship
while controlling for the other variables in the model. Therefore, at least
some of the factors that could account
for the relationship between parental
death due to heart attack and IHD
mortality through the transmission of
family traits (such as smoking, drinking, obesity, a sedentary way of life, for
example) are controlled, lending support to family heart disease mortality
as an independent risk factor.

Social Biology

It is also important to note that the
effect of family history (i.e., parental
heart attack death) is sex-linked. That
is, for women it is the heart attackdeath of the mother only and for men
it is the heart attack-death of the father
only that predicts early IHD death.
This finding conflicts with Schildkraut
et al. (1989), who report that the heart
disease mortality of either parent is important for both sexes. As most studies
examining the effect of family history
of heart disease mortality have restricted their samples to men, it is not
possible to reconcile these conflicting
findings.

Compared to later IHD death, very
early male IHD mortality is more
likely to be affected by smoking than
is very early female IHD mortality.
Men display 2.23 times the risk of dying from IHD at ages 25-44 if they
are heavy smokers in contrast to moderate smokers (the contrast group).
For women of these ages, a risk exists
as well, but it is smaller (1.33 odds) and
not statistically significant. Similarly,
men who do not smoke are somewhat
less likely (0.86 odds) to die early
from IHD than are moderate smokers.
Women, on the other hand, are not protected from early IHD death through
not smoking; the risk for nonsmokers
is not statistically significant.

Overall, smoking is a significant risk
factor for very early IHD mortality
for men but not for women. It is not
known whether this difference is due
to a protective mechanism within
women (possibly biologically-based) or
whether it is due to differences in
smoking styles/habits (e.g., men inhale more deeply, smoke closer to the
filter, are less likely to smoke filtered
cigarettes, etc.) (Waldron, 1986a). The

data relating to spousal smoking pro~ vide a clue, however. Nonsmoking
wives protect men from the risk (0.58)
3 odds) of very early IHD mortality
3 whereas heavy smoking wives are as"e sociated with only a small and not staeB tistically significant risk for men. However, spousal smoking does not affect
dying very young from YHD for
women. This may be partly due to the
low probability of IHD death for
young women.

Occupation has no effect on early
compared to later IHD mortality
among men. On the other hand, young
women are less than one-half as likely
to die from IHD if they are blue collar
or agricultural workers than if they are
in white collar or service occupations

(the contrast group). Similarly, homemaking seems to exert a protective effect (0.57 odds) in comparison to the
contrast category. With regard to fertility, women who have 4 or more children are one-half less hkely to die from
IHD at young ages compared with
women with 1-3 children. Similarly,
childlessness exerts a protective influence, although not to a statistically significant degree. (Since within-gender
differences are not the focus of the
analysis, issues concerning female
work and fertility are not dealt with
here but will be briefiy highlighted in
the Summary and Discussion section).

Heavy alcohol consumption increases the risk of early IHD death for
both men (1.32 odds) and women (1.67

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

120 Wister and Gee

odds) compared to medium drinking,
but the latter is not statistically significant due to a large standard error for
the coefficient. A low level of drinking
decreases the risk for both men and
women to an approximately equal degree. Thus, these data do not support,
for either sex, the research suggesting
an association between lower mortality
and moderate drinking (see BaumBaicker, 1985).

Persons with unacceptable body
mass (either too fat or too thin) have a
slightly elevated risk of dying very
young rather than later in life from
IHD, but statistical significance is not
reached for either women or men.
Regular exercise reduces the risk of
very early IHD mortality for both men
and women, compared to the contrast
category (not very regular exercise).
However, a sedentary lifestyle is also
protective for both men and women. It
appears that, at least for the risk of
very early IHD mortality, irregular exercise is more “‘dangerous”’ than both
much or very little exercise, and that
this finding holds for both sexes.

IHD DECEDENTS AGED 25-64

Among this age grouping, which
overlaps with the previous one, there
are proportionately more women as
the numbers of men and women dying
from IHD in the older segment (i.e.,
ages 45-64) are nearly equivalent (see
Table 1).

The strongest predictor of the timing of IHD death is smoking. For
women, heavy smokers are nearly 5
times more likely to die from THD
younger than older compared to moderate smokers. Among men, the risk ts
approximately 3 times higher. However, a protective effect of not smoking

 

Social Biology

compared to moderate smoking occurs
for women only. Similarly, a nonsmoking spouse decreases the likelihood of
dying from IHD before age 65 for both
men and women (0.62 and 0.57 odds,
respectively). However, it should be
noted that the probabilities of dying
from IHD younger rather than later
in life due to heavy spousal smoking
are in opposite directions for men
and women, although neither of these
associations is statistically significant.
Thus, these data suggest that gender
differences in the risk of dying young
from THD associated with smoking
are complex. While heavy smoking is
definitely a risk—although more for
women than for men—the risk associated with spousal smoking and the protection of not smoking differ by sex and
suggest that the deleterious effects of
smoking (and passive smoking) need to
be further examined.

Family history of heart attack again
emerges as an important variable, although the results differ somewhat for
this age grouping. Having either a
mother or a father who died from a
heart attack significantly affects the
probability of dying earlier than later
in life from IHD among women (2.84
and 2.22 odds, respectively). However, among men, only paternal heart
attack significantly increases the risk of
early IHD mortality (2.64 odds). These
data suggest that research on the role
of family history of heart attack as a
determinant of early IHD mortality
needs to pay greater attention to the
“family transmission” of heart disease
for women.

Men who are heavy drinkers have a
higher likelihood of dying before
rather than after age 65 from IHD than
do moderate drinkers (1.67 odds), but

the association for women is not significant. A significantly decreased likelihood of THD death associated with
light drinking exists for both men and
women (0.67 and 0.48 odds), again
casting doubt on research findings that
suggest that moderate drinking is the
“healthiest” drinking behavior.

As with the previous age-at-death

women are at less IHD mortality risk
(0.54 odds) than women with 1-3

While regular exercise has a small
protective effect, slightly greater for
women, the results are not significant.
However, being sedentary has a statistically significant protective effect for
both women (0.53 odds) and men (0.74
odds). As with the previous analysis, it
appears that irregular exercise (the
contrast group) is the least “healthy”
behavior.

THD DEcEDENTS AGED 80+

In turning to persons who die at very
old ages, we are looking at the probability of dying from IHD late compared
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

122 Wister and Gee

to earlier in life. Thus, the odds ratios
in Table 5 are interpreted differently
than in the two previous Tables. In
Table 5, a high odds ratio indicates a
protective effect, because now we are
comparing the chances of dying from
IHD late rather than earlier in life.

A striking feature of the regressions
provided in Table 5 is the high degree
of similarity between men and women.
The magnitudes of the odds ratios for
the independent variables for women
and men are quite comparable (with
one exception, spousal nonsmoking).
This finding indicates that gender differences in the variables predictive of
late compared to earlier IHD death are
relatively small.

While heavy smoking is associated
with a low likelihood of dying late from
IHD (0.33 odds for men; 0.13 odds for
women), again we see that nonsmoking does not significantly affect mortality chances (relative to moderate
smoking, the contrast category). Having a spouse who does not smoke increases the chances of dying late for
both men and women, but particularly
for men for whom the odds ratio exceeds 4. However, a heavy smoking
spouse is not a significant risk factor for
either men or women. Again, we see
that smoking is a complex phenomenon in relation to IHD mortality.

Parental death due to heart attack is
a significant factor for both men and
women, and is not sex-linked. As expected, the effect of parental heart attack death is to decrease the likelihood
of dying from IHD at old ages rather
than at younger ages. In other words,
having a parent who died from a heart
attack is associated with a greater likelihood of dying from IHD young rather
than late in life.

 

Social Biology

Again, the effect of occupation is
much stronger for women than for
men. For men, being tn a professional/
managerial job lowers the odds (0.66
odds ratio) of dying later than earlier in
life from THD relative to the contrast
occupational group (white collar and
service). For women, both being a
homemaker and working in a blue collar or agricultural occupation more
than double the odds of dying later
rather than earlier from THD (in comparison with white collar/service occupations). Similarly, for women, being
childless significantly increases the
odds (1.64 odds ratio) of dying at old
ages.

Heavy drinking lowers the odds for
both men (0.53 odds ratio) and women
(0.60 odds ratio), although the effect is
significant for men only. Light drinking
increases the odds of dying later rather
than earlier, approximately 1.5 times
for both sexes, but is statistically significant for women only.

An unacceptable body mass lowers
the odds of late IHD death for men
(0.62 odds ratio) but not for women.
For women, being sedentary doubles
the odds of dying later rather than earlier from IHD. The other exercise relationships do not reach statistical
significance.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In general terms, the findings here
indicate that the ranking of determinants of the timing of IHD death are:
lifestyle factors (see footnote 4), biological factors, and, finally, socioeconomic factors. Our findings regarding
the importance of smoking, spousal
smoking, drinking and parental transmission of risk are in keeping with the

literature, although results here suggest complexities in the operation of
variables that need further study. The
lack of importance of occupation (for
men) and the results associated with
the fertility variable are unexpected
findings that may have relevance for
further research.

Turning to our specific hypotheses,
the first hypothesis—that IHD mortality risks will vary by gender and across
the life course—is supported. Also, we
find that the magnitude of risk factors
varies by gender. The second hypothesis—that the independent variables
will exert a lower IHD risk for women
than for men at all ages—is not supported. Together, these findings sug
gest that the explication of gender differentials in the timing of mortality (at
least regarding heart disease) depends
upon models that incorporate different
risks, and varying magnitude of those
risks, by gender and age. At a minimum, considerations of female mortality need to include family history,
fertility, and type of occupation, all
variables that are rarely included.
Also, the differential risks associated
with smoking, spousal smoking, drinking, Occupation, and exercise need
to be accurately assessed. The third
hypothesis—that differential risks by
gender will be larger for younger ages
at death—is supported. Reasons for
this remain unclear and require further
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

124 Wister and Gee

exploration. However, it appears that
many of the protective effects associated with being female diminish with
age.

In addition to the support/refutation
of specific hypotheses, our findings
bear on a number of issues relevant to
male-female differentials in mortality
and survivorship. The role of family
(i.e., parental) history of heart attack
mortality, and its possible sex-linked
characteristic, suggests an important
avenue for research. It is important to
add women to studies concerned with
family history and heart-disease risk,
particularly among young ages-atdeath groups. It should be noted, however, that since this analysis is based
on only decedents of IHD, the effect
of parental transmission may be
magnified.

Findings regarding smoking and
spousal smoking, and their differential
effects by gender and age at death, illustrate the intricacies involved with
the smoking variable(s). Given increases in female smoking, there is
clearly a need for more refined research on the mortality consequences
of smoking. These findings provide details as to why the relationship between
increased female smoking and heart
disease mortality rates remains ambiguous (Waldron, 1993).

Our results regarding gender, mortality, and occupation—specifically,
that occupation plays a minor role in
the timing of IHD mortality for men
and a fairly important one for women

—indicate another avenue of explora
tion. This finding conflicts with explanations of greater female longevity
that focus on women’s sheltered role in
the home (Kotler, 1989). Indeed, these
data provide little support for the pro
 

Social Biology

tective effect of the homemaker role.
Rather, they suggest that blue collar
and agricultural jobs are the “‘healthiest” for women. This finding departs
from that of Hazuda et al. (1986) who
report that women employed in clerical
and sales jobs are at the least risk of
IHD, although their dependent variables were risk factors (e.g., cholesterol levels, body mass, blood pressure, glucose intolerance, smoking)
rather than mortality. It may be that
the effects of employment are mediated through family and work-setting
variables. The findings here point to a
factor (women’s outside-the-home employment) that may increase mortality
differentials by gender. Also, our findings show the importance of research
focusing on variables associated with
gender and work in relationship to
mortality.

For the two female age-at-death
groups for whom the childbearing
years are complete, childlessness acts
as an IHD mortality protector. The relationship between number of children
ever-born and IHD mortality has been
little-researched, but, if these findings
are valid, they suggest another factor
that could increase the gender differential in mortality, assuming that childlessness levels increase, as is predicted
(Veevers, 1993).

It is clear that lifestyle factors play a
leading role in the timing of IHD death
and in accounting for some of the gender differences. However, the complexities of relationships, along with
the role of social and economic factors
in determining lifestyle behaviors,
leave considerable uncertainty as to
how health promotion initiatives could
be tailored to meet the specific needs of
women and men.
