ABSTRACT: From retrospective survey reports 1985-87, the study examined the determinants of
neonatal and post-neonatal survival in three provinces in China. Conditional logistic regression
models were employed to estimate the effects of macro- and micro-level factors (such as
socioeconomic conditions, familial relationships, as well as biosocial determinants) on the
survivorship of neonatal and post-neonatal infants in China. The study yielded two findings:
(1) Social changes in Chinese society had a strong positive effect on neonatal and post-neonatal
survivorship; and (2) the magnitude of such social changes differed across regions which, in turn,
led to the differential effects on neonatal and post-neonatal survivorship across provinces in

China.

Between 1954 and 1990, China experienced an unprecedented infant
mortality decline from 139 to 30 per
thousand (Jiang et al., 1984; Wang,
1986; Grant, 1992). China achieved
this unexpected infant mortality decline at an average income level which
was among the lowest in the less developed countries. Attempts to explain
China’s success in reducing infant mortality to a level almost comparable to
that of a developed country have so far
focused on the broad level of changes
in the political and social institutions of
the Chinese society. Some studies have
attributed this success to the “political
will” of the Communist government in
launching campaigns to improve environmental sanitation, to increase the
coverage of immunization for infants
against a host of infectious diseases,
and to enhance the organization of the
basic infrastructure of maternal and
child health care centers (Jamison,
1985). Other studies have emphasized
the contribution of the Chinese gov
ernment’s family planning policies and
campaigns on literacy and technical education for women which have greatly
facilitated a marked degree of autonomy of women in China (Caldwell,
1986; Sen, 1993).

However, despite a wealth of literature addressing infant mortality in
China, little is yet known about the
mechanisms and processes through
which the “government will or campaigns” improve infant survivorship.
The macro-level approach of these
studies (often with national-level data)
has largely neglected the importance of
micro-level sociodemographic as well
as biosocial characteristics in infant
mortality decline in China. Under the
premise that the “government will
or campaigns” impose universal impacts across all parts of China, these
investigations often do not allow interregional comparisons and are thus
likely to obscure tremendous variability in infant survival across different regions or provinces in China.

The purpose of the study is therefore twofold: (1) to examine various
factors that account for the improved
infant survivorship in China; and (2)
to explore regional variations in infant survivorship in three provinces in
China: Shaanxi, Liaoning, and Guangdong. I begin by reviewing a series of
conceptual issues that link macro-level
social forces and micro-level sociodemographic factors with infant survival in other less developed countries.
After discussing the relevance of
these studies to the Chinese context, I
present my approach through the formulation of a simplified causal model,
then describe the data used in the analyses, test the hypotheses presented in
the causal model, and discuss the results of the analyses.

CONCEPTUAL ISSUES

Studies in many traditional societies
(historical or contemporary) have
found a strong, persistent association
between the education of mothers and
differentials in infant survival (Lindenbaum, 1983; Mosley and Lincoln,
1984). In an effort to explain this association, most studies tend to focus
on the forces that influence maternal
education as well as the mechanisms
through which maternal education influences infant survival. While macrolevel socioeconomic forces (e.g., government policies) have been found to
influence maternal education, the family has been suggested to function as
the main mediating force linking maternal education with infant survivorship (Caldwell, 1979). According to
these hypotheses, the key to mortality
decline in these traditional societies is a
synergy between mass education of
women at the broad societal level and

 

Social Biology

an egalitarian politics within the family
which leads to a more receptive attitude toward health services use.

These hypotheses posit that emphasis on education of women by some
governments in the less developed
countries has greatly changed the traditional balance of familial relationships between: generations. Unlike
women in their traditional roles, educated women are more likely to challenge their mothers-in-law, more likely
to attempt to communicate with their
husbands, and more likely to succeed
in establishing more companionate relationships within the extended family.
This rise in the status of women within
the family means that mothers will become less ‘‘fatalistic”’ in case their children get sick. Instead of leaving their
sick children to God’s hands (the notion that God gives and takes away
life), educated mothers are more likely
to demand immediate medical attention for their sick children. Moreover,
when their children get sick, educated
mothers are in a position to know
better and to use more efficiently the
existing medical facilities.

There is a good theoretical basis
for expecting connections of macrolevel socioeconomic forces and microlevel sociodemographic characteristics
(e.g., maternal education and familial
relations) with infant survival in China.
Since the Communist revolution in
1949, China has started to break away
gradually from a traditional patriarchal
family system. There has been a move
toward freedom of mate selection, a
lessening of the elder’s power, and a
rise in the position of women (Parish
and Martin, 1978; Pasternak, 1986).
These changes within the Chinese family have coincided with a dramatic decline in infant mortality, which is in

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

turn believed to have resulted from
two macro-level political forces: (1) the
Communist government’s extraordinary efforts to put women’s education
on top of the national agenda and to
liberate women from the feudal bondage of the traditional Chinese society;
and (2) the Communist government’s
campaigns in family planning and public health measures (Young and Prost,
1985; Caldwell, 1986).

The impacts of these government’s
efforts on infant survivorship in China
may work through two different channels. One is that the government’s
campaigns in family planning and public health measures may have a universal influence on infant survivorship
across all regions, regardless of socioeconomic development. This line of
reasoning is supported by studies that
use national aggregate data. The other
channel is that although the government’s efforts in family planning, in
raising women’s educational level and
status, and in public health measures
are national policies, the success of
these campaigns nonetheless depends
largely on how those campaigns are
perceived, accepted, or implemented
at the regional levels.

There are known differences in the
level of socioeconomic development
across regions in China (PCO, 1985;
CFPYC, 1986). Moreover, there also
exists a varying pattern of family life
across different provinces in China
(Lavely and Ren, 1992). While family
life in the more developed provinces is
characterized by a higher degree of
autonomy of women, family life in the
less developed provinces may be more
traditional, patriarchal in nature. Different levels of socioeconomic development and varying patterns of family
life across regions are likely to lead to

Infant Survival in China 3

differential perception, acceptance, or
implementation of the government’s
campaigns across different provinces.
This difference may exist because unequal socioeconomic developments
coupled with a differential pattern of
family life may determine the status of
women in the family —whether women
can make decisions about resource distribution and about seeking health care
for their infants if needed. In this analysis I examine these hypotheses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The study used “China In-Depth
Fertility Survey—Phases I & II”
(CIDFS) conducted in 1985 and 1987.
CIDFS employed a stratified multistage sample design, one in which the
ultimate areal units were neighborhood committees in cities and production teams in rural areas. Within each
selected area, systematic selection of
households was made and within these
selected households, ever-married
women aged 50 or less were interviewed. Detailed descriptions of the
sample design and characteristics of
the data are given by the Department
of Population Statistics of State Statistical Bureau (DPS, 1986).

CIDFS collected information in two
municipalities and seven provinces.
This analysis, however, used only
the data from Shaanxi, Liaoning, and
Guangdong provinces to make the
sample population more heterogeneous. Shaanxi province, located in
the Northwest, is largely a rural, less
developed province; Liaoning province, comprising the Northwest China
Plain, represents one of the more industrialized areas in China; Guangdong province, located in the south
with its boundary surrounding Hong

Kong, is an economically  welldeveloped region.

CIDFS was a life retrospective history data set, one which comprised a
longitudinal record of when events
happened. Because the information
collected depended upon the recall of
events and dates of events in the past,
this data-collecting procedure presented several potential methodological problems, i.e., omission of events
and misreporting of dates of deaths
(Hobcraft et al., 1985; Singh, 1987).
However, a cultural emphasis on
knowledge of dates in China seems to
ameliorate both problems. Respondents in China, even if illiterate, can
supply quite reliable dates of events for
their children based on the traditional
Chinese calendar (Coale and Li, 1991).
Even so, however, it is still difficult
for older women to remember certain
events such as the birth weights of their
newborns some thirty years before the
survey. Therefore, some of the results
should be interpreted with caution.

It is also important to distinguish
two types of problems related to retrospective life history data, namely
right censoring and selectivity. Right
censoring denotes essentially a curtailment of exposure by the date of the
interview (Rodriguez and Hobcraft,
1980). This problem of censoring is
ubiquitous in all event history data.
Using standard statistical procedures
will lead to severe bias and loss of
information (Allison, 1982). Fortunately, the development of life tables
with covariates and hazards models has
provided an important means to handle the problem of right censoring
(Cox, 1972; Allison, 1982).

The problem of selectivity arises because of the incompleteness of a wom
Social Biology

an’s reproductive career in the life retrospective history data (Nath et al.,
1994). The intervals available for analysis tend to be biased toward the older
birth cohorts who have completed their
reproductive career at the time of the
survey. To test this possible bias, I conducted separate analyses using a subsample of available life history, i.e.,
the birth cohort aged 40-49 at the time
of the survey (Rodriguez and Hobcraft, 1980; Rindfuss et al., 1982). Because of similar results (available upon

request), I opted to present the results

based on the total sample in the paper.

For the purpose of this study, I recreated the data in such a way that
ever-married women were no longer
the cases as in the original data set; instead, the new cases were represented
by each birth based on the birth-order
information. Due to the loss of sibling
mortality information during the process of recreating the data,! the results
of the current study may lose potentially important familial as well as genetic effects shared among siblings
(Guo, 1993; Geronimus and Sanders,
1993).

DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT
VARIABLES

The dependent variable of the study
is the event of survival. Because the determinants of survival change as the infant grows older, the dependent variable of the study is disaggregated into

'The sibling structure in child mortality data was
lost when the author re-organized the data a few
years ago. The original data sets are no longer available to the author. However, although one should
not ignore clusters of siblings in mortality data, one
recent study based on data from Columbia indicated
that the contribution to child mortality from sibling
structure in child mortality seems modest net of
household socioeconomic status (Guo, 1993).

the probabilities of surviving the intervals of less than one month and of one
to eleven months, or neonatal and
post-neonatal periods respectively
(DaVanzo et al., 1983). With the introduction of neonatal intensive care
(NICU’s) technology, there are some
questions about the distinction between neonatal versus post-neonatal
mortality. However, since NICU’s are
not widely available in China’s countryside which consists of over 70 per
cent of China’s total population, the
distinction between the neonatal and
post-neonatal periods is still valid. As
will be discussed later, some covariates
tend to impose different effects on neonatal versus post-neonatal survivorship, which justifies the separation between the neonatal and post-neonatal
periods.

There are four groups of covariates
used in the study: (1) biosocial determinants which include birth order,
breastfeeding status, birth weight,
mother’s age at birth, sex, and place of
delivery; (2) familial relation variables
such as age differences between
spouses, marriage type, and communication between spouses; (3) microlevel social background factor (or maternal education); and (4) macro-level
social background factors (e.g., type
of area and year of birth). To examine
a possible U-shaped relationship between mother’s age at birth and infant
mortality, i.e., infants of younger or
older mothers are at a higher risk of
mortality, mother’s age at birth was
grouped into =20, 21-27, and 28 or
older categories in the study. Birth
weight was a two-category classification: =6 pounds to denote low birth
weight, whereas =7 pounds to measure
normal birth weight.

Infant Survival in China 5

The study does not contain direct
measures of macro-level social forces.
Instead, I use year of birth and type of
rural-urban area as proxies for macrosocial forces. Birth year groupings
were selected based on the macro-level
conditions that each period represents.
Prior to 1965, China witnessed the establishment of a universal health care
(cooperative health insurance) system,
a considerable use of health campaigns
by the government as a means of obtaining its health objectives (Zheng,
1992), and a family-planning campaign
to warn young women of the dangers of
early and frequent childbearing to the
health of their children (Ren, 1992).
The period of 1965-69, the most chaotic time of “‘the cultural revolution,”
saw a softening and negligence of family planning efforts. Between 1970-74,
the government launched the campaign of “later, longer, and fewer
births,” which emphasized later marriage and promoted the ideal of a twochild family with the two births spaced
three to four years apart. The period of
1975-79 marked the end of “‘the cultural revolution” and the beginning of
the post-Mao era when China adopted
an open-door policy or “the economic
reform.” Beginning from 1980, a
national-wide campaign of ‘‘one-child”’
was launched by the government.
Meanwhile in 1980, the government
promulgated a new marriage law to
make family planning mandatory and
reiterate the equal status of women to
men.

If infant survival in China has been
influenced by these various government campaigns, then year of birth
should reflect the timing of such an influence. Likewise, if the governmental
policies have imposed a_ ubiquitous

6 Ren

influence across China regardless of socioeconomic developments, then one
would expect no rural-urban differences in infant survival.

While most of the other covariates
are self-explanatory, further explanations of the three familial background
variables are needed. Age differences
between spouses may be a proxy for
power between the two sexes. In a patriarchal family system such as of
China, in order to ensure men’s dominance in the family, the husband’s parents may prefer a young daughter-inlaw so that she can easily be socialized
into her role in her husband’s family.
Parental age difference was a fourcategory classification: parents of the
same age, fathers being 1-3, 4-6, and
=7 years older than mothers. While
“parents of the same age”’ stands for a
higher status of women in the family,
“fathers being 1~3 years older” is a
widely-accepted ideal age difference
between spouses in China. “Fathers
being 4—6 years older’’ measures men’s
dominance in the family, whereas “‘fathers being =7 years older” is not desirable in the Chinese society, for only
men from poor families who cannot afford to marry at an earlier age have to
wait and marry much younger wives
(laofu shaogi) (Yuan, 1982).

The marriage type includes three
categories: (1) non-arranged (or free)
marriage and neolocal residence after
marriage, (2) arranged marriage and
extended residence, and (3) the joint
family type, either arranged marriage
but neolocal residence, or free marriage but extended residence. While
arranged and extended families indicate full parental involvement in the
marriage process, the joint family type

suggests partial parental involvement;

Social Biology

whereas nonatranged and _ neolocal
families denote a higher degree of
autonomy for young mothers in the
family.2

“Discussion over family size between spouses’’ may serve as an important proxy for spousal communication
and hence intrafamilial relations. Although such conversations may seem
routine in the West, there is a certain
reserve or self-sufficiency which discourages free and informal communication in many less developed countries. The reluctance to talk about
sexual matters is even stronger. When
the amount and scope of husband-wife
communication tend to be minimal,
even “discussion of family size” tends
to play an important role in family
relations between spouses (Bogue,
1975).

Together, these familial relation
variables reflect different dimensions
of the relative autonomy of women
within the Chinese family. The higher
status of women in the family, as indicated by a smaller age gap between
spouses, less parental involvement in
marriage arrangement, and active engagement in spousal communication,
means that women are likely to possess
control over the decision-making on

2While extended residence or family refers to
co-residence with parents after marriage, neolocal
residence or family refers to residence away from
parents. The reason to create a “‘joint family type”
is due to three considerations: First, the ban of arranged marriage by the Marriage Law of 1950
forced many families to mislabel some arranged
marriages as free marriages; second, over time, patrilocal residence had turned more or less into a ritual formality or symbol of family harmony, a result
of the compromise between the traditional ideal of
co-residence and a shortage of available sons due to
a steady decrease in fertility; and finally, even many
free marriages started in extended residence due to
lack of living space.

the allocation of surviving resources
and use of medical facilities.

METHODS

To examine the effects of the covariates on neonatal and post-neonatal
infant survivorship, I employ a series
of conditional logistic regressions,
which are given as follows (Allison,
1982):

logit q = In [q,(1 —;,)] =
A+ ByXig7 + D2Xigg +. © + Op Xin

where gq is the probability that an infant
(i) who survived to age (t) continues to
survive in the interval between ¢ and
t+ n; a is the intercept representing
the odds of surviving for infants for
whom the values of all coefficients
equal zero; and b is the vector of coefficients of the covariates, x,,.

The logistic regressions (SAS logistic procedures) estimate the effects on
the log of odds of being in category one
versus being in the other (SAS, 1989).
Hence, in this study the conditional
probabilities of “dying” for the neonatal period are simply the number of
neonatal deaths/number at risk. Likewise, the conditional probabilities of
surviving neonatal infancy are simply
the number of neonatal survivors/
number at risk. Take Shaanxi province
as an example. The conditional probability of surviving neonatal infancy is
10,856 survivors (11,391 — 535)/11,391
(number at risk). Since the conditional
probabilities specify that infants will
drop out of the analysis for time units
in which their events have occurred or
censored, for Shaanxi province 535
(neonatal deaths) and 17 (censored)
cases are not then included in the
model run on the post-neonatal period.
Thus, the conditional probability of

 

Infant Survival in China 7

surviving the post-neonatal infancy for
Shaanxi is 10,607 survivors (10,839
— 232)/10,839 (remaining number at
risk).

There are two components of the
analyses in the study: bivariate and
multivariate analyses. Using the
pooled data of the three provinces, I
perform the bivariate analyses for
“year of birth” and “‘type of area”’ (urban vs. rural). In order to test to what
extent the effects of macro-level social
conditions are buffered by other covariates, the bivariate results are later
compared with the multivariate results. In addition, bivariate analysis is
also conducted for geographic location
or “province” so as to justify the separate multivariate model for each of
the three provinces. The purpose of
these separate models is to test the hypothesis to what extent the mechanism
that influences infant mortality varies
across different regions in China.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

Table 1 presents sociodemographic
profiles of Shaanxi, Liaoning, and
Guangdong provinces. As the table
shows, there is a great diversity among
these three provinces. The per cent of
newborns delivered at home and the
per cent of illiteracy for women was
higher in Shaanxi than that in Liaoning
and Guangdong. Compared with
Shaanxi and Guangdong, the per cent
of low-birth-weight infants and the per
cent of illiterate women was lower in
Liaoning, while the per cent of urban
population was higher in Liaoning. In
Guangdong, there existed a discrepancy between its relatively higher level
of socioeconomic development and

some of its demographic and biosocial
characteristics. On the one hand, the
per cent of newborns delivered at
home and the per cent of illiterate
women was lower in Guangdong; yet,
the percentages of higher-order births
and low-birth-weight infants were
higher in Guangdong.

These three provinces also differ in
the familial relation dimensions. While
the per cent of couples who engaged in
discussion about family size was lower
in Shaanxi, Liaoning was characterized
by a higher per cent of couples who engaged in such type of communication.
The per cent of couples who lived in
joint-type families (either lived neolocally even though their marriages
were arranged or co-resided with parents even though their marriages were
not arranged) was higher in Guangdong. In addition, the per cent of husbands who were more than seven years
older than their wives was also higher
in Guangdong.

Table 2 provides some basic characteristics of neonatal and post-neonatal
mortality in Shaanxi, Liaoning, and
Guangdong provinces. Between the
study period (1950-87), neonatal infants on average were susceptible to
higher mortality (34 per thousand live
births) than post-neonatal infants (13
per thousand live births). This pattern
is also consistent across all three provinces. Table 2 also shows a regional
variation in infant mortality. Compared with Liaoning and Guangdong,
the rates of neonatal and post-neonatal
mortality were significantly higher in
Shaanxi.

BIVARIATE RESULTS

The bivariate (unadjusted) effects
of year of birth, region, and type of

Infant Survival in China 9

area are contained in Table 3. Consistent with previous studies (Jiang et al.,
1984; Wang, 1986; Grant, 1992), both
neonatal and post-neonatal infant survivals in these three provinces had improved over time, as indicated by an
increase in the strength of coefficients
over time. Compared with neonates
born before 1965, the probabilities of
surviving the neonatal period were
1.46 [exp(0.38)] times greater for the
1965-69 cohort; 1.99 [exp(0.69)] times
greater for the 1970-74 cohort; and
2.16 [exp(0.77)] times greater for the
1975-79 cohorts. Furthermore, postneonatal survivorship experienced
more improvement than neonatal infancy, as indicated by the stronger
coefficients. Compared with the cohort before 1965, the probability of
surviving neonatal infancy was 2.58
[exp(0.95)] times greater for the
1980-87 cohort; whereas the probability of surviving post-neonatal infancy
was 4.39 [exp(1.48)] times greater for

_ the 1980-87 cohort.

Infant survivorship was also influenced by geographical location in
which families resided. Urban area was
often associated with a higher level of
socioeconomic development, such as
easy transportation and easy access
to medical facilities; whereas rural
area was Virtually deprived of most of
these healthy environments. As a result, residing in the rural area significantly decreased the probability of
survival as compared with living in
the urban area. Such effect was also
stronger during the neonatal period.
Compared with the urban area, the
probabilities of surviving neonatal
and post-neonatal infancies in the
rural area were 61 [exp(—0.49) = 0.61]
and 69 per cent [exp(—0.37) = 0.69]

respectively. Alternatively, since
1/0.61 = 1.64 and 1/0.69 = 1.45, it also
meant that living in the urban area increased the probabilities of surviving
neonatal infancy by 64 per cent and
surviving post-neonatal infancy by 45
per cent.

There is also a regional difference in
both neonatal and post-neonatal infant
survivals. Compared with Shaanxi, a
province with lower socioeconomic development, Liaoning and Guangdong
experienced significant higher rates
of neonatal and post-neonatal infant
survivals. On the other hand, despite
their differences in socioeconomic
and familial background characteris
tics, Liaoning and Guangdong witnessed almost similar neonatal and
post-neonatal survival probabilities.

mained a strong predictor of survival
for both neonates and post-neonates.
For instance, compared with neonates
born before 1965, the log odds of survival for the 1965-69 cohort only decreased from 0.38 in the unadjusted
model (Table 3) to 0.33 in the adjusted
model (Table 4).

On the other hand, after controlling
for all the covariates (except for “‘province”), we find the effects of type of
area (urban vs. rural) increased for the
neonatal period but decreased for the
post-neonatal period. For the neonatal
period, the log odds increased from
—0.49 (unadjusted model) to —0.69
(adjusted model); whereas for the
post-neonatal period, the log odds
decreased from —0.37 (unadjusted
model) to —0.19 (adjusted model),
and the effects changed from being significant to nonsignificant. This finding
indicates that the effects of the macrolevel socioeconomic condition, mea
sured by year of birth and type of area,
were either mediated or “‘suppressed”
by the covariates included in this study.

Columns 3-5, which report the results of the separate logistic regression
models for each of the three provinces,
yield several findings that are broadly
consistent with previous studies in
China (Ren, 1994). Lower survivorship is associated with higher parity
births, very young age of mothers, lack
of breast milk, low-birth-weight babies
(=6 pounds), and lack of access to
medical facilities as indicated by births
delivered at home. Some of these biosocial determinants also tend to impose
very similar effects on both neonatal
and post-neonatal infant survivals in all
three provinces, suggesting that other
things being equal, the biosocial effects
on infant survivals were more or less
the same across regions.

After controlling for the other covariates in the study, year of birth had

a strong influence on both neonatal
and post-neonatal survivals, a pattern
consistent across all three provinces.
The result suggests that social changes
in the Chinese society over time have
played a key role in improving infant
survivorship. Year of birth may serve
as a proxy for macrosocial changes or
modernization processes which generate changes at the other levels of social
life such as the gradual improvement of
women’s status and improving environment like better living conditions
and better access to medical facilities.
Furthermore, the magnitude of such
improvement in neonatal and _ postneonatal infant survivals was greater in
Shaanxi, indicating that the low socioeconomic development region benefitted most from these social changes.

It is interesting to note that the effects of year of birth in all three provinces reveal a gradual improvement in
infant survivals over time (as indicated
by the gradient effects). Assuming that
various campaigns were launched by
the Communist government at some
particular period of time, the effects
of year of birth would then be expected
to be irregular, i.e., more dramatic effects would be expected following the
campaigns. The fact that the effects
were graded suggests that those government campaigns had little impact
on the infant mortality decline in
China. This does not mean, however,
that the government played no role in

infant mortality decline. Improvement

in infant survival may be attributed to
some social changes that might have
resulted from the sustained “will” of
the Communist government to modernize the country.

The degree to which living in the rural area influences infant survivals

 

 

Social Biology

tended to vary across provinces. Compared with living in the urban area,
other things being equal, living in the
rural area significantly decreased the
log odds of surviving neonatal infancy
by —0.39 in Shaanxi, —0.65 in Liaoning, and —1.06 in Guangdong. On the
other hand, only in rural Shaanxi was
the log odds of survival (—0.59) significantly lower for the post-neonatal period. Given the higher level of socioeconomic development in Guangdong
and Liaoning, it is puzzling to see that
during the neonatal period the effects
of living in the rural area are stronger
in these two provinces than that in
Shaanxi. One possible explanation is
that social equity may be different
across these provinces. The ruralurban disparity in Shaanxi, a less developed province, may be smaller as
compared with the more developed regions of Guangdong and Liaoning.
This rural-urban gap seems to be more
likely to influence the survivorship of
neonates, who tend to be more vulnerable to the biological factors. During
the post-neonatal period, survivorship
is more susceptible to social factors as
Shaanxi, a less developed region, witnesses a lower survivorship for postneonates in its rural sector. This finding is consistent with the literature,
i.e., while neonatal infant mortality
was more likely to be influenced by
biosocial factors, post-neonatal infant
mortality was more likely to be effected by social factors (or social
changes) (Omran, 1971).

The effects of familial relations on
infant survival also tended to work in
different ways in these three provinces.
In Shaanxi, marriage type had an expected effect on neonatal infant survival. Compared with living in free and

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

neolocal families, infants living in
joint-type families (with partial parental involvement in the marriage process) were significantly less likely to
survive [exp(—0.54) = 0.58]; whereas
infants living in arranged and extended
families were even less likely to survive
[exp(—0.69) = 0.50]. In Guangdong,
however, the effects of marriage type
worked the opposite way. Compared
with living in free and neolocal families, infants living in arranged and extended families were significantly more
likely to survive neonatal infancy
[exp(0.53) = 1.70); infants living in
joint-type families were also more
likely to survive neonatal infancy
[exp(0.35) = 1.42), but the effect was
only marginally significant.

Consistent with the results of marriage type, while age differences between parents had a negative effect on
neonatal infancy in Shaanxi, age differences had a strong, positive effect in
Liaoning and Guangdong. For instance, compared with parents of the
same age, “father being 4-6 years
older than mother’ decreased (though
marginally significant) the log odds
by —0.30 or [exp(—0O.30) = 0.74] in
Shaanxi, but significantly increased
the log odds by 0.48 or [exp(0.48) =
1.62] in Liaoning and by 0.37 or
[exp(0.37) = 1.45] in Guangdong.

These results suggest that the mechanism of familial relations on infant
survival worked in different ways
based on the level of socioeconomic
development of each province. In the
socioeconomically less developed region (Shaanxi), familial relations were
associated with the status of young
women in the family. Marriage type
and age differences which reflected low
women’s status tended to decrease the

 

 

Infant Survival in China 15

probability of infant survival. On the
other hand, in more developed areas
(Liaoning and Guangdong), familial
relations might not be related to women’s status. Due to a higher population
density (e.g., shortage of living space),
living with parents after marriage
might be necessary; furthermore, due
to the nature of intensive labor in those
areas, having parents look after their
infants might be critical to improving
the survival chances of these infants.
Although the effects of maternal education were in the expected direction,
the magnitude of such effects seemed
to vary across provinces. In Shaanxi
and Liaoning, maternal education had
significant, negative effects on neonatal infancy; but in Guangdong, maternal education had no significant ef
' fect on neonatal survival. There were

no significant effects in all three provinces on post-neonatal infant survival.
These findings provided mixed results
to the robust effect of education found
in other less developed countries. This
robust effect seemed to be supported
in Shaanxi and Liaoning, i.e., even after controlling for the other covariates
included in the study, maternal education still had a strong, negative effect
on neonatal infant survival. In Guangdong, however, maternal education
did not impose significant effects on
neonatal infant survival. Moreover,
during the post-neonatal period, maternal education in all three provinces
had no significant effects even after
controlling for all other covariates.

SUMMARY

The current study yields the following broad points and specific conclusions. First, the study shows that while
the success in reducing infant mortality

 
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

16 Ren

in China over the past several decades
has been unusual for the level of government intervention, there is some
evidence that neonatal and _ postneonatal infant survivals have also
been effected by familial relations, by
socioeconomic conditions, and by biosocial factors. In explaining the factors
that may have attributed to the historical decline in infant mortality in
China, the study found that even after

controlling for other covariates, year of

birth remained a strong predictor of
neonatal and post-neonatal survivals.
This finding suggests that social
changes that have occurred in China
over time have contributed a great deal
in improving infant survivals in
Shaanxi, Liaoning, and Guangdong
provinces. Since these social changes
may be attributed to the influences accompanying the socioeconomic development or to the government policies
in modernizing the country, it is difficult, however, to determine whether
infant mortality decline in China is a
result of the government intervention
or a result of the macro-level social
forces that are unrelated to the “government will.”’

Second, the effects on. neonatal
and post-neonatal infant survivorship
tended to vary across provinces. Under
different socioeconomic — circumstances, familial relations and rural residence had different implications for
neonatal and post-neonatal infant survivals in China. In the more developed
regions of Liaoning and Guangdong,
living in the rural area tended to impose a stronger effect on the survival
of neonates compared with in Shaanxi,
a less developed region. This finding
could be due to a larger rural-urban
gap in the more developed regions

 

 

 

Social Biology

which produced a large disparity in infant survivorship between the urban
and rural areas. Likewise, in the more
developed regions, co-residence with
parents after marriage, a usual sign of
lower status of women in the traditional societies, is unexpectedly associated with a higher infant survivorship. Intensive labor requirements and
higher population density in the more
developed regions in China might have
changed the meaning of co-residence
with parents into a necessity and not a
symbol of the status of women in the
family. Having grandparents around
the household presumably improved
the survival chances of infants. These
findings suggest the importance for future research to differentiate regions
when studying the mechanisms that
influence infant mortality in China.
Studies based on the national-level
data are likely to produce biased estimates of the determinants of infant
survivals.

There are some indications that familial relations (e.g., discussion of
family size) may function as the mediating force linking macro social
changes and health services use (e.g.,
place of delivery) in influencing infant
survivals. As Table 6 shows, the number of couples who discussed family
size increased gradually and significantly over the study period. Since
spousal communication about family
size was associated with place of delivery of newborns (Table 7) and since
place of delivery was highly correlated
with infant survival, the results here
indicated a causal relationship, i.e.,
changes in the Chinese family which
resulted from social changes tended to
impact places of delivery, which in turn
influenced infant survival.

research, there is a need to develop sophisticated methods in order to understand fully the varying mechanisms
through which familial relations influence infant survival in different regions
of China. Furthermore, to understand
fully the unprecedented decline in infant mortality in China, future studies
also need to identify mechanisms to
sort the separate effects of government
policies from various aspects of social
changes in the Chinese society.
