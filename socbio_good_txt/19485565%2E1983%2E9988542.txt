Fertility Effects of Isolated Spouse Separations

in Relation to Their Timing

ABSTRACT: Three dimensions of isolated spousal separation largely determine its fertility impact: (1) length, (2) “‘completeness”’ (degree to which it is eliminating fecundability during fecundable months), and (3) its timing as defined by the reproductive state of the wife at its start.
While it is obvious that by starting when the wife is in the fecundable state its net delaying of
next conception is maximized, it is much less clear with which reproductive state its start should
coincide in order to minimize its fertility impact. By means of a simple model, it is shown that
for minimum impact a separation should start later in a pregnancy the longer is post-partum
anovulation, the higher is the level of intrauterine mortality, and the shorter is the period of
separation. Conditions of natural fertility are assumed.

Under conditions of natural fertility,
an important component of any closed
birth interval is the one or more ovulatory periods between the end of temporary anovulation and the next conception. While subject to chance variation,
the length of these ovulatory intervals
depends on the couple’s natural fecundability. James (1979) has marshalled
evidence that the primary determinant
of natural fecundability is coital frequency. Even for the same couple, this
monthly frequency is far from constant.
Anything which reduces frequency,
then, such as temporary spouse separations, becomes a matter of considerable
importance. Two studies demonstrating
the sizable effects of this factor on marital fertility are Chen et al. (1974) and
Van de Walle (1975).

Indeed, there has been enough interest associated with the problem of
spousal separation as a fertility determinant, so that one of the modules of the
World Fertility Survey interview instrument includes a series of questions on
the topic. Hill and Shorter (1979) have

proposed an index for measuring the impact of spousal separation upon marital
fertility.

In theoretical work (Menken, 1979;
Bongaarts and Potter, 1979; and Potter
and Kobrin, 1982a) spousal separation
has been treated as a kind of contraceptive, operating to delay the next conception by reducing or eliminating fecundability during the fecundable periods with
which it overlaps. This work has assumed that separations do not modify
the pregnancies already in course or alter the lengths of post-partum anovulation or the risks of secondary sterility.
The assumption of conditions of natural
fertility is necessary for the results to be
clear and unambiguous, for, where birth
control is utilized, the question immediately arises: To what extent is the separation merely substituting for contraception that would otherwise have been
practiced?

Two broad classes of spousal separation may be distinguished: (1) seasonal,
or, more broadly, cyclic, and (2) isolated or individual separations. The

former are often associated with fishing
or farming occupations while the latter
are often linked with military service or
with migration from one community to
another in which the husband precedes
the rest of the family.

Three dimensions of separation
largely determine its fertility impact.
First, and most obvious, is its length.
Second, is whether the separation is
‘‘complete”’ or not, and therefore
whether it eliminates fecundability
when overlapping fecundable exposure,
or merely reduces fecundability by reducing the frequency of coitus within the
intermenstrum. The third dimension is
its timing. Does it start when the wife is
in a fecundable state, when she is pregnant, or when she is temporarily amenortheic?

In terms of this third dimension, if the
separation starts when the woman is in
the fecundable state, then a complete nmonth separation should delay the next
conception n months. If, on the other
hand, it starts when she is pregnant or in
a post-pregnancy anovulatory state,
then its net fertility effect is reduced due
to the overlap, partial or entire, with
temporary infecundability. The manner
in which the timing of cyclic spouse separation within a pregnancy interval affects the interval’s length has been studied by Potter and Kobrin (1982b).

With respect to single separations,
the comparable question is: With what
reproductive state should the start of
spousal separation coincide, in order to
minimize the expected net delay of the
next conception? This question, the object of investigation of the present paper, turns out to be a complex issue, one
whose answer is not wholly intuitive. Indeed, no single reproductive state such
as the first month of gestation always
qualifies. Instead, it is a function of the

Potter et al.

values taken by three factors: length of
separation, average length of postpartum anovulation, and the overall
rate of spontaneous pregnancy wastage.

The paper is organized into the following five sections: (1) the hypotheses,
(2) the model, (3).the formulas, (4) the
main results, and (5) the summary and
discussion.

THE HYPOTHESES

It is obvious that, under natural fertility conditions, starting separation during a fecundable month maximizes the
fertility impact of a complete n-month
spousal separation. It is not at all clear,
however, what reproductive status
would minimize the effect of such a separation. One might suppose that it
would be the first month of pregnancy.
This supposition would be valid only if
one knew, in advance, that the pregnancy was going to lead to a live birth,
thereby assuring nine-“plus” months of
pregnancy and post-partum nonsusceptibility. If, on the other hand, one knows
only the current length of the pregnancy
and not its outcome, then the picture
changes and becomes much more intetesting.

If the separation starts during the
fourth or fifth month of gestation, instead of the first month, one forfeits the
possibility of overlap with the initial few
months of pregnancy but, at the same
time, one also greatly reduces the risk of
pregnancy wastage, given that most recognizable miscarriages occur in the second or third gestational months. Thus,
there arises the question of whether the
overlap of separation and the infecundable period is maximized by starting separation with the first month of pregnancy
or by starting separation in a later gestational month. In the former case, there
Vol. 30, No. 3

is the overlap of separation with the initial gestational months, but simultaneously, a much greater risk of miscarriage. There will be, therefore, a
heightened proportion of women who
will miscarry and therefore become susceptible relatively early in the separation period. For these women, the net
delaying of the next conception is significantly greater than for the women
_, Whose pregnancies end in a live birth. In
= the case where separation starts later in
“the gestational cycle, the proportion of
Swomen who will later spontaneously
eabort is very much reduced, thus deA creasing the number of women who will
ec become susceptible early in the separaation period. This lower number of
women miscarrying is gained at the expense of forfeiting overlap with the initial months of gestational infecundabilBaty among the majority of women
5 blessed with live births.
= We see, therefore, that the problem
Sof maximizing the expected overlap of
>>
separation and infecundable periods,
Othat is, minimizing the number of sus2 ceptible months the couple spends
apart, is neither simple nor intuitively
obvious. It is, in fact, dependent on sev‘Seral factors. One may argue, for examSple, that if the expected difference between the infecundable periods associSated with a live birth and a fetal loss is
large enough, then it becomes necessary
to minimize the number of fetal losses,
and, therefore, a mid-gestation start of
separation would vouchsafe more overlap, on average, than a first month start.
Then too, if the overall rate of spontaneous pregnancy wastage is higher, it will
take a longer current pregnancy in order
to achieve a given reduced level of subsequent fetal loss. Hence, one may plausibly hypothesize that (1) longer postpartum anovulation, and (2) a higher

Isolated Spouse Separations

281

overall rate of intrauterine mortality,
permit a later timing of separation to
minimize the net delaying of next conception.

Whether long or short separations
give advantage to a later timing of the
start of separation is harder to see, and,
indeed, will be found later to be a function primarily of the length of postpartum anovulation.

The model for testing the above hypotheses regarding the length of postpartum anovulation and the rate of intrauterine mortality, as well as the
connections with the length of separation, is described in the following section.

THE MODEL

What is necessary is an apparatus that
estimates the average overlap E(0) with
infecundable periods of complete separations lasting n months, among couples
sharing a specified fecundability. The
length of separation minus the average
overlap, or n—E(0), defines the net delay of the next conception, the quantity
to be minimized.' Adequately specifying fecundity entails choosing probability distributions for the nonsusceptible
periods associated with live births and

1The argument that the reproductive state at
start of separation which maximizes its expected
overlap with the infecundable period is also minimizing its net delaying of the next conception applies to incomplete as well as complete separation.
Accordingly, exactly the same set of starting states
that minimize fertility impact under specified combinations of separation length, mean duration of
post-partum anovulation, and level of intrauterine
mortality holds whether separation is complete or
incomplete. On the other hand, expected net delays to next conception, taken as absolute values,
are being reduced by any incompleteness of separation; and the formulas for these expected net delays under conditions of incomplete separation are
more complicated than simply 7—£(0), applicable
to complete separation.

fetal losses, respectively, as well as the
conditional risk, 0;, of a later pregnancy
loss, given that the current length of
pregnancy is exactly i months. The level
of natural fecundability turns out to be a
matter of indifference since our concern
is with the extent of overlap between
separation and infecundable periods,
not with the rapidity of conception during fecundable exposure when the
couple are cohabitating. A monthly
time unit is assumed throughout the
analysis.

The length of the infecundable period associated with a fetal loss is represented by the truncated geometric distribution employed by Bongaarts (1977).
Despite its simplicity, this distribution
well captures the rapidly declining incidence of fetal wastage as gestational age
increases (Leridon, 1971), the brief
length of post-partum anovulation
(Boyd and Holmstrom, 1972), and the
limited range from two to ten months.
Without serious distortion, pregnancies
ending in live births are assigned a constant value of nine months.

Length of post-partum anovulation is
represented by the two-parameter negative binomial distribution (Potter and
Kobrin, 1981). Its advantage over the
curve most commonly used, namely, the
modified Pascal distribution proposed
by Barrett (1969), it is the avoidance of
excessive variances when the mean substantially exceeds twelve months. Both
curves are most appropriate where the
distribution of post-partum anovulation
is unimodal as a result of either very
brief breast-feeding or the absence of infant deaths. The two curves have the advantage of generating conditional
monthly probabilities of resumption of
ovulation that increase with the period
elapsed since childbirth. This increase
fits with new insights into the mecha

nisms relating length of post-partum
anovulation to lactational behavior.

The algebra of the two probability
distributions for the infecundable periods as well as that for the formulas discussed below are given in the next section.

Defined as short, medium, mediumlong, and long post-partum anovulation
are negative binomial distributions averaging m=2.0, 10.8, 14.2, and 23.3 (in
months). The latter three figures are
based on amenorrhea series taken, respectively, from the Khanna Study in
Punjab, India, from INCAP in Guatemala, and from Matlab, Bangladesh
(Potter and Kobrin, 1981). The first,
short distribution constitutes a more
hypothetical curve portraying a situation of absent or very brief lactation. Together, the four distributions essentially
span the observed range of post-partum
anovulation length (Bongaarts, 1980,
and Lesthaeghe and Page, 1980).

Defined as low and high overall risks
of pregnancy wastage are 6=0.15 and
0.30. The former is below the 0.20 to
0.25 encountered in studies especially
designed to control the underreporting
of second-month miscarriages (Leridon,
1977), while the latter is more typical of
older women and therefore high for a
simple cross-section of women.

The lengths to assign separation, n,
are more arbitrary. It is desirable to
have a sufficient range so that what happens for very short or very long separations becomes evident. Also useful is an
intermediate length. Lengths n=6, 12,
and 48 (months) are adopted for these
purposes.

Since the incidence of miscarriage decreases rapidly as one passes from early
to late months of pregnancy, the probability 6;, of a later fetal loss, as a funciion
of current length i of pregnancy, also de

creases rapidly. Over half of all recognized miscarriages occur in gestational
months 2 and 3, which means that for a
pregnancy already lasting three months,
the risk of a later intrauterine death is
much less than 6. Values of 0, for
§=0.15 and 0.30 are assembled in Table
1.

reproductive state which minimizes the
impact of separation by maximizing the

If the first month of separation coincides with the ith month of pregnancy,
expected overlap varies depending upon
whether that pregnancy subsequently
ends in wastage or in a live birth. Respective probabilities of these outcomes
are 6,and 1—96,. Let us represent the expected overlap and its dependence upon
the starting state, pregnancy outcome,
and separation length, as follows

E(0|G(i),n) = 8,E(0|G(i),A,n) +
(1-0,) E(O|G(),L,n) for i=1,2,3,...,

Here the symbols “A” and “L” denote
the pregnancy outcomes of abortion and
live birth. Explicit formulas for these
quantities as well as for E(Q|L(10),n),
the expected overlap when the start of
separation and the start of post-partum
anovulation coincide, are found in the
next section.

It is worth noting that the overlap
E(0|L(10),n) is typically smaller than n,
even when the average length of postpartum anovulation m is appreciably
greater than n. This inequality, illustrated by several combinations of m and
nvalues in Table 2, results from the variability of anovulation after childbirth.
Since the overlap of separation with the
infecundable period can never exceed
the separation length n, those separations which coincide with post-partum
anovulatory periods briefer than n drop
the average of overlaps below the value
of n.

Menstruation typically follows an
early abortion within six weeks, meaning that any delays of menstrual onset
that might be construed as temporary
anovulation are of the order of two
weeks. This generalization may be invalid for a late pregnancy loss, but stillbirths are only a small fraction of all
spontaneous pregnancy losses. If the intrauterine deaths occurring during gestational month i, spanning exact gestational ages i-—1 to i, are distributed
uniformly and therefore occur at an average gestational age of i—0.5, the associated infecundable periods end on average at exact gestational age 7. Hence,
it is reasonable to treat those ith gestational] months that include fetal losses as
full months of infecundability.

This convention means that f,(i) also
serves to represent the probability distribution of infecundable periods associated with fetal losses. As a result formulas (6), (7), and (8) below are greatly
simplified.

THE MAIN RESULTS

It has been hypothesized that the fertility impact of spousal separation will
be minimized if the separation start coincides with a later gestational month,
when (1) the average length of postpartum anovulation, m, is longer, and
(2) the overall risk of pregnancy wastage, 8, is higher. ‘These expectations are
tested in Table 3. Factors m and 6 operate as predicted. Specifically, for a given

that produces the shortest mean conceptive interval moves to higher gestational
months as the average length of postpartum anovulation, m, increases.
Given long post-partum amenorrhea,
the effect of 48-month separations is
minimized by starting them during the
fourth or fifth gestational month, and
the effect of six-month separations is
minimized by postponing separation until about the time the child is safely born.
A later timing of separation also leads to
a minimum conception delay as 6 increases.

In addition, Table 3 illustrates the interconnections between separation
length, average length of post-partum
anovulation, and the overall risk of
pregnancy wastage, and indicates that as
separation length increases, at a given
level of overall intrauterine mortality
and average duration of post-partum
anovulation, the separation should start
at earlier gestational stages in order to
maximize overlap and hence, to minimize the net delay to next conception.

Potter et al.

Social Biology

An explanation for this last result is
as follows. When the start of separation
coincides with a later month of gestation, there will be a greater proportion
of pregnancies ending in live births, but
the overlap with the infecundable early
pregnancy months is forfeited. If, on the
other hand, separation starts at the beginning of gestation, then all women
having a live birth are infecundable
throughout a greater proportion of separation; however, this proportion of
women among all women is reduced. In
order to realize the maximum overlap
and therefore the minimum number of
fecundable months apart, there must be
an optimum balancing between the gain
of a higher proportion of all women having a live birth and the reduction of average per-capita overlap with infecundable months among the women having a
live birth. This latter cost proves minor
when for example, separation is only six
months and post-partum anovulation
averages 2.0 months. If the starting state
of separation is G(5), with the probability of a live birth 1—@5 near 1.0, there
will be few cases of abortion-associated
nonsusceptible periods that allow the
six-month separation to overlap with as
many as two to four fecundable months.
Most pregnancies will end in a live birth
and the associated last five gestational
months plus one more month of anovulation assures a complete overlap of separation with nonsusceptible exposure.
Thus, in this case, optimal starting state
Gs generates appreciably more overlap
than starting state G;.

Quite different is the situation of 48month separations with post-partum
anovulation still averaging 2.0 months.
Here when a starting state of G; is chosen in favor of G,, the cost in forfeited
overlap among women having a live
birth is virtually four months apiece. Be
 
 

Vol. 30, No. 3

cause the associated risk of abortion, 45,
is so close to zero, the cost in forfeited
overlap per woman is (1—8s) 4 or close
to four months. Moreover, this loss outweighs the gain from raising by (1—@s)—
1—6,=98;,—86s5, or almost 0, the proportion of women having a live birth, which
proportion will average about nine
months more overlap apiece than the
women suffering abortion. That is, because 4 > 96, or more exactly 4(1—@5) >
9(6—6;), starting state G, this time generates more overlap with unfecundable
months than starting state Gs, the reverse of the case when separation is
short.

Detailed results are presented in Table 4. Three separation lengths by average length of post-partum anovulation
are crossed with different gestational
starting states of separation, providing
the net delay to conception for each
case. The number of starting states is expanded to include the fecundable state
(F) and the first through third months of

Isolated Spouse Separations

287

post-partum anovulation (L(10), Z(11),
and L(12)). What are worth noting are
the large contrasts in the net delay of
next conception between separations
starting during a fecundable state and
those commencing during pregnancy or
early post-partum nonsusceptibility. As
shown in Table 4, the contrasts tend to
be larger for longer separations. What is
also evident is that, other factors being
equal, the importance of starting state is
greater when zis longer. This is true for
m=23.2 as opposed to 14.2 and for
m= 14,2 as opposed to 2.0. Even in this
last case, the contrast is appreciable
enough to render the reproductive state
of the wife at the start of the spousal separation an important determinant of the
impact of separation on natural fertility.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The results of Tables 3 and 4 are easily summarized. The timing of spousal
separation has an important bearing on

its fertility impact. This bearing is significant only in relative terms when the
separation is short, but becomes highly
significant in absolute terms, as well,
when the separation is long. Other factors being equal, the reproductive state
at the start of separation that minimizes
its fertility impact stands later in the infecundable period when the length of
post-partum anovulation is longer, the
overall risk of intrauterine mortality is
higher, and the separation is shorter.
Some explanations of these results have
been suggested.

All these results are predicated on
unimodal distributions of post-partum
anovulation characteristic of either
short lactation or else freedom from infant mortality. As Lesthaeghe and Page
(1980) have demonstrated, however,
post-partum amenorrhea is commonly
bimodal owing to an initial mode of brief
amenorrhea lengths associated with infant deaths followed by the principal
concentration of amenorrhea lengths
several months later, resulting from the
lengthy lactation of mothers whose babies do survive.

To illustrate its effects, this bimodality may be crudely operationalized as a
mixture of two unimodal distributions,
with the minority of cases of infant mortality represented by the geometric distribution that averages 2.0 months and
the majority of cases of surviving infants
represented by the negative binomial
distribution that averages 14.2 months.
The weight attached to the former distribution, equal to the stipulated rate of in

fant mortality, is set successively at 0.00,
0.10, and 0.20. As this rate increases,
the overall mean length of anovulation
decreases while the corresponding variance increases owing to rising heterogeneity. The resultant changes in the reproductive state at the start of
separation that minimizes the fertility
impact are seen in Table 5 by glancing
down columns. The changes are modest. Furthermore, the changes occur in
the anticipated direction, that is, in the
direction expected from a decreasing
length of post-partum anovulation,
which is, in this case, a function of the
increase in infant mortality.
