Age Heaping in Recent National Censuses:

An Addendum

In an earlier article in this journal
(Stockwell and Wicks, 1974), we presented
a brief description and analysis of the extent and pattern of digit preference and
avoidance in the age statistics of 64 national
censuses taken since 1965. Here we supplement that article by presenting additional
data on this phenomenon in 37 censuses
that have been taken since 1970.

As noted in our earlier article, the tendency for persons to “round-off” to certain
preferred digits when reporting numerical
data, such as age or year of birth, often
leads to a marked pattern of “heaping”
throughout an age distribution. That is,
there will be an overrepresentation of persons with ages or birth years ending in the
preferred digits (0, 5, and to a lesser extent
8), and an underrepresentation of ages or
birth years ending in the remaining digits
(especially 9 and 1).

As before, the technique selected to measure the extent of digit preference/avoidance in age statistics is the “blending”
method described by Robert J. Myers
(1940). This is a technique which derives
a “blended” population that is essentially
a weighted sum of the number of persons
reporting ages ending in each of the ten
terminal digits. Assuming no systematic irregularities in age reporting, the “blended”

sum at each terminal digit should approximate 10 per cent of the total “blended”
population. If the sum at any given digit
exceeds 10 per cent of the total “blended”
population, it indicates overselection of ages
ending in that digit (digit preference).
Conversely, a sum that is less than 10 per
cent of the “blended” total indicates underselection of ages ending in that digit (digit
avoidance). An overall measure of the extent of digit preference/avoidance is the
Index of Preference, which is defined as
one-half of the absolute sum of the deviations for each of the ten terminal digits.

Our previous research has suggested that
an overall index value of 3.0 is a reasonable
cut-off point to separate out countries whose
statistics may be regarded as generally accurate and relatively free from bias. Among
the 37 new countries examined here, the
following 21 had Index of Preference values
below 3.0:

Index of Preference less than 1.0.—Argentina, 1970; Australia, 1971; Canada,
1971; Ireland, 1971; New Zealand, 1971;
Scotland, 1971; United Kingdom, 1971.

Index of Preference between 1.0 and 1.9.
—Belgium, 1970; Federal Republic of
Germany, 1970; Finland, 1970; Puerto
Rico, 1970; Republic of Korea, 1970;
Thailand, 1970.

second in preference, while among those
ages divisible by 2, those ending in 2 or 8
should be selected more than those ending
in 4 or 6 because the latter two flank the
more preferred digit 5. On the other hand,
major avoidance should characterize ages
ending in 1, 3, 7, or 9 (ie., those digits
that are not multiples of the divisors of
the base of the number system), with
avoidance being especially pronounced for
