ABSTRACT: Detailed 1977 national natality data are used to investigate social, demographic,
and genetic effects on birthweight differentials. Analysis of birthweight differences among
infants with white, black, and mixed black-white parents indicates that a portion of the
observed weight differentials appear to be due to biologic factors. Infants with a black mother
and father have the lowest mean birthweights, while infants with two white parents have the
highest weights. Newborns with mixed-race parents have intermediate birthweight
distributions. Multivariate analysis suggests that the effects of parental race on birthweight are
not the result of maternal/obstetric differences among parents of the same or mixed race.

a genetic component, since if this factor
is important, its exclusion from analysis
will simultaneously confound our understanding of both the causes of ethnic
birthweight differentials as well as interventions necessary for reducing the incidence of babies born too soon or too
small. This issue is of special importance
because of the pervasive relationship
between poverty and ethnicity.

This paper explores the relationships
among ethnicity, birthweight, and selected social or demographic factors.
Specifically, the paper compares the effect of factors such as father’s educational attainment, mother’s educational
attainment, age, previous pregnancy
history, and prenatal care, with the effects of a possible genetic component on
observed differentials in birthweight in a
national population.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH

Numerous studies have explored the
association between poverty and fetal
development (Eisner et al., 1979; Gortmaker, 1977; Sepkowitz, 1982). Garn et
al. (1977) found that while all measures
of social status have a positive association with birthweight, social status has a
more pronounced effect on the weight
of black infants than is true of whites or
Puerto Ricans. In addition, among the
social factors, maternal education was
found to have the greatest effect on the
likelihood of delivering a low-weight infant. Other researchers using ecological
indicators in cross-national studies
found that mean birthweight had a positive association with per capita GNP,
extent of urbanization, educational attainment, and literacy (Boldman and
Reed, 1977; Hauser, 1959). Similar findings have been reported using national
data (Baird, 1974; Stockwell and Wicks,
1984).

Social Biology

Although the findings concerning the
association of maternal age and birth
weight are mixed, the majority of stud1es report greater proportions of women
at the extreme ends of childbearing age
have low-birthweight infants than do
women in the prime childbearing ages
(Bouvier and van der Tak, 1976; Bross
and Shapiro, 1982; Gortmaker, 1979;
Kleinman, 1982; Ventura and Hendershot, 1984). The effect of maternal
age upon birthweight appears to be partially due to factors that covary with maternal age, including socioeconomic status, marital status, parity, and prenatal
care. For example, women under age 20
are more likely to have low-birthweight
infants, but are also more likely to be
primiparous, unmarried, and to delay
prenatal care (Taffel, 1980; Ventura and
Hendershot, 1984; Zuckerman et al.,
1983).

Two elements of a woman’s reproductive history—parity and previous fetal or infant death—have been investigated in studies of birthweight.
Although some researchers have reported greater proportions of lowweight infants among first births and
fifth or higher order births (Berkowitz,
1981; Peters et al., 1983), other studies
report interaction effects between maternal age and parity (Selvin and
Janerich, 1971; Shapiro et al., 1968) or
no statistically significant effects of maternal age after controlling other factors
(Bross and Shapiro, 1982). Research investigating the effects of previous fetal
or infant loss on birthweight is more
consistent: Most studies show that previous loss increases the risk of bearing
low-birthweight infants (Fedrick and
Anderson, 1976; Eisner et al., 1979;
Kessner et al., 1973). A number of studies report an association between prenatal care and birthweight. Receipt of prenatal care, especially care initiated in

the first trimester of pregnancy and continued until delivery, is associated with a
lower risk of bearing low-birthweight infants (Kessner et al., 1973; Stickle and
Ma, 1977; Showstack et al., 1984; People and Siegel, 1983).

Although race is strongly associated
with birthweight (Kessel et al., 1984;
Williams et al., 1986; Hemminski and
Starfield, 1978; Morton et al., 1967;
NCHS, 1984; NCHS, 1987; NCHS,
1988), race differentials are not clearly
understood. Several factors have been
suggested as contributing to the differentials, including socioeconomic status
(Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977; Chez
et al., 1976; Gortmaker, 1977; Garn et
al., 1977; Hemminski and Starfield,
1978), maternal age, parity, wedlock
status (Bross and Shapiro, 1982; Eisner
et al., 1979; Gortmaker, 1979; Kehrer
and Wolin, 1979; Kleinman, 1982), and
pregnancy weight gain, height, and prepregnancy weight (Goldstein, 1981;
Hardy and Mellitis, 1977; Levkoff et al.,
1982; Taffel and Keppel, 1982).

Based on a large prospective study of
perinatal mortality, Naeye (1979) found
a higher incidence of premature rupture
of fetal membrane, placental growth retardation, amniotic fluid infections, and
congenital malformations among black
fetuses and neonates. That these differences are nonracial in origin is suggested
by the fact that they were either reduced
or eliminated when controls for mother’s prepregnancy weight and antenatal
care were employed.

Several studies have suggested that
observed birth weight differentials are a
consequence of both social-demographic and biological factors. Numerous
studies report that while controls for
various socioeconomic and demographic factors reduced the incidence of
low birthweight, they did not eliminate
it (Naylor and Myrianthopoulos (1967;

 

Infant Birthweight 15

Garn et al., 1977). Morton (1955) and
Carlson (1984), as well as Seltzer and
Mayer (1966), argue that about one-half
of the observed differentials among diverse ethnic or racial groups is due to social and environmental factors, while
the remaining one-half is biologic in
origin. Naylor and Myrianthopoulos
(1967) have also suggested that race may
be a polygenetic variable affecting birthweight. Maternal weight and height, genetic genomes, maternal ethnic origin,
and differential rates of fetal development are among the biologic factors
considered to impact infant birthweight.
Although the mother’s height appears
to be the primary biologic determinant
of birthweight, a similar but weaker association is obtained between the mother’s prepregnancy weight and birthweight.

Numerous studies suggest that
birthweight has a genetic component
which is maternal in origin (Morton et
al., 1967; Morton, 1955; Seltzer and
Mayer, 1966). Ounstedt (1978) argues
that observed birthweight differentials
are partly determined by maternal genomes. Johnson and Inglis (1974) found
that the sisters of women who had delivered a low-weight infant were significantly more likely to have a low-weight
baby than were sisters-in-law. Grossman and colleagues (1974) reported that
maternal ethnic origin was associated
with significant birthweight differentials, while a follow-up study of paternal
origin (Handlesman et al., 1975) revealed no significant effects on infant
birthweight.

Several studies demonstrate that
both optimum birthweight—the weight
associated with lowest infant mortality—and mean gestational-agespecific birthweight are different for
black and white newborns (Garn et al.,
1977; Wilcox and Russell, 1983, 1985;
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

16 Mangold and Powell-Griner

Benkin et al., 1986). A study of
birthweight among ethnic populations
in Hawaii reported that the optimum
weight ranged from 3,678 grams for
whites to 3,358 grams for Filipinos and
suggested that low birthweight for these
populations be defined as 2,500 grams
and 2,200 grams respectively (Morton et
al., 1967). Differences for other ethnic
populations in the United States have
been documented for Asian Americans
(NCHS, 1984), American Indians and
Alaskan Natives (NCHS, 1987), and
Hispanics (NCHS, 1988). These studies
show that the proportion of births under
2,200 grams for American Indians,
Alaskan Natives, and Hispanics are similar to those for other whites, despite
their shorter mean gestational periods
and tendency to be concentrated in obstetric categories associated with low
birthweight—the young and less educated, those who receive fewer prenatal
visits, and those who start prenatal care
late in the pregnancy. Such studies suggest that genetic factors are partly responsible for differential rates of fetal
development.

There is evidence that fetal development proceeds at different rates for
blacks and whites (Garn et al., 1977;
Morton et al., 1967; Wilcox and Russell,
1983). These studies find that black infants develop at a more rapid pace than
whites during the first 36 weeks of gestation. An analysis of California data suggests that fetal development may proceed at a different rate for various race
groups as evidenced by higher mortality
rates for black than white newborn populations with identical birthweight distributions (Binken et al., 1985). Wilcox
and Russell (1986) arrive at similar conclusions using North Carolina data.
These investigations suggest that while
the lower birthweight of nonwhites may

reflect prior genetic or nutritional factors, they do not necessarily indicate retarded fetal development. A significant
implication of such studies is that the use
of 2,500 grams as a single proxy measure
of retarded fetal development or prematurity may be inappropriate for different
race or ethnic groups and may obscure
the effects of other factors.

A review of past research suggests
that although the disparity in birthweight distribution of blacks and whites
is well documented, there is a lack of
concensus concerning the causes of this
differential and a need for research
which examines both types of factors simultaneously. This paper contributes to
the literature on birthweight differentials by examining the effects of selected
social, demographic, and genetic factors
on birthweight within a multivariate
framework.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data used in this analysis are individual birth records from the 1977 detailed natality files for the United States,
consisting of approximately 2.8 million
records. The analysis is restricted to
birth records of singleton infants containing race information on both parents. Four race categories are used:
white mother and white father, black
mother and black father, black mother
and white father, and white mother and
black father. This classification is more
specific than that used by the National
Center for Health Statistics and hence
will yield greater detail than is typically
available from NCHS publications.

NCHS designates the newborn’s race
according to the race of the parent(s). If
one parent is white, the child is assigned
the other parent’s race or national origin. When neither parent is white, the

Vol. 38, No. 1-2

child is assigned the father’s race with
one exception. If the mother is Hawaiian or part Hawaiian, the child is classified as Hawaiian. If the race of one
parent is missing, the child is assigned
the race of the parent for whom race is
given. The race of the child is considered
not stated and is allocated when information on race is missing for both parents (NCHS, 1979). It is important to
note that “race” as used in this paper is a
gross measure. The categories of
“white” and “‘black” are not genetically
homogeneous. In addition, births to
parents other than whites and blacks are
excluded from the analysis because of
substantial heterogeneity of the groups
and the fact that the number of mixedrace births among these other race categories yield numbers too small for reliable analysis.

The other variables used in the analysis include gestational age at birth, infant sex, mother’s live-birth order,
mother’s age, month prenatal care
started, number of prenatal visits, mother’s education, father’s education, number of previous fetal deaths, gestational
age at birth and infant birthweight.

The 1977 natality micro-data tapes
consist of 2,772,186 unweighted re

cords. Records for eighteen states are
based on 50 per cent samples and when
inflated yield a weighted n of 3,326,632.
Tables 1-3 and Figure 1 are based on an
extract file of single births where the
parents were coded as either black or
white. This extract file contains a
weighted n of 2,850,089. Because thirteen states (Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho,
Maryland, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington) did not code one or more of the variables used in the regression analysis, a
second extract file was created which included these states. This was necessary
because the only appropriate way to
handle missing data in the SPSSx regression procedure is the list-wise deletion
of cases. The elimination of records
from the thirteen nonrecording states
produced a weighted extract file of
1,326,620 single births to black and
white parents. Table 4 and Table 5 are
based on ann of 1,177,805 which reflects
the loss of 148,815 because of missing
data among the recording states. Table 6
is based on ann of 364,055. This number
consists of all births to a black mother
and a black father and where the mother
or father are either black or white. Re

missing or where the father’s race is not
white or black have been excluded.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows the mean birthweight,
weight differentials, number of births,
and standard deviations for single births
for each of the four race categories.
Compared with white mothers and
white fathers, newborns with other combinations of parental race have a lower
mean birthweight. Black mothers deliver infants of lowest weight, irrespective of the father’s race. In addition, differences in mean birthweight according
to mother’s race (167 grams and 148
grams) are greater than those for father’s race (99 grams and 80 grams).

The effects of parental race on
birthweight are also evident in Figure 1

and Figure 2, which show the
birthweight distributions of infants according to parental race. Both figures indicate that newborns with parents of the
same race have the most distinctive
birthweight characteristics, while the
offspring of parents of mixed race form
intermediate distributions. As was seen
earlier, Figure 1 shows that infants of
white parents have the heaviest
birthweights, while infants of black parents have the lightest weights. Babies of
white mothers and black fathers have
heavier weights than those with black
mothers and white fathers. Figure 2 is
the probit of the cumulative birthweight
distributions and provides greater detail
in the tails of the distribution than is true
of an ogive based on per cents. The cumulative probit function clearly shows
the distinctive weight patterns between
newborn with white and black mothers.

fant than does the father’s. The largest
differences occur between infants whose
parents are of the same race, either both
black or both white, while the proportions of low-birthweight newborns of
mixed-race parents are fairly similar to
each other.

The suggestion from past research
that fetal development may proceed at a
different pace for whites and blacks is
considered in Table 3, which shows
mean birthweight by parental race and
the length of gestation. The data in Table 3 clearly show that infants of black
parents have the lowest mean
birthweight in each gestational age
group and that infants of white parents
have the highest mean weight at gestational ages above 37 weeks. The most
striking difference observed among infants born at 37 weeks gestation or less is
the higher mean birthweight among babies with a black mother and white father (2,711 grams), resulting in a mean
birthweight 197 grams heavier than babies of white parents, and a 269 gram advantage over babies whose parents are
both black. However, it should be noted
that the numbers of parents of mixed
race in general, and especially the category of white father and black mother,
are relatively small.

There are no consistent differentials
among infants with gestation periods of
38 to 39 weeks or 40 to 41 weeks. However, large differences which are consistent with the mean weight differentials
seen in Table 1 are observed for gestations of 42 weeks or more as well as for
births with missing gestation data.
Other patterns in Table 3 are less consistent, but generally the effects of mother’s race on mean weight appear to exceed those of father’s race.

 

Infant Birthweight 21

The data in Tables 1-3 and Figure 1
lend credence to the hypothesis that
birth weight is affected by parental race,
with mother’s race generally having a
larger effect on infant birth weight than
race of father. The data also lend support to the idea that there may be differences in the rate of fetal development of
blacks and whites, especially in the first
36 weeks of gestation.

As noted earlier, social and demographic factors play an important role in
birth weight differentials. Table 4
presents information for a series of
maternal/obstetric indicators which are
available from the detailed natality files
for black and white parents of the same
and mixed race. Table 4 indicates that
social and demographic differences are
largest for infants with a white mother
and father relative to all others, but the
differences among the remaining combinations are fairly small. For example,
the mean maternal age for the category
white mothers and white fathers is
nearly one year higher than for white
mother and black father, and about onehalf a year higher than the combination
black mother and black fathers. A similar pattern occurs for all other variables.

In general, the differences observed
in Table 4 indicate that newborns with
white parents have the most favorable
maternal/obstetric characteristics, while
infants with a black mother have the
least favorable characteristics, irrespective of the father’s race. These differences, although small, are of special interest for the items which indicate access
to prenatal care. On average, prenatal
care among women in the white mother
and white father category was initiated
about two weeks earlier than for other
parental combinations, and this group

of women also had an average of one to
two more prenatal visits than other
women.

Two variables shown in Table 4 display patterns which are noteworthy. Although slight, differences in the mean
length of gestation are consistent with
birthweight differences and suggest a
larger maternal effect. The difference in
mean length of gestation between white
and black mothers is approximately 0.60
weeks, while paternal differences are
about one-third to one-half as large.
Differences in the sex-ratio show a small
maternal effect relative to the parental
effect. These differences are consistent
with a recent investigation which found

the primary sex ratio to be predominantly paternal in origin (Khoury et al.,
1986).

In order to pursue the issue of a possible maternal genome effect on birthweight, a multiple regression analysis
was performed with birthweight as the
dependent variable. The independent
variables used in this part of the analysis
consist of the items shown in Table 4. In
addition, three binary dummy variables
were employed for parents of mixed
race. The first dummy is for the combination of a black father and white
mother, the second is for the combination of a black father and white mother,
the second is for the combination of a

“Regression models which used birth weight 1n its standard and as a natural log were both obtained The model based on the
log of birth weight yielded a slightly better fit (R? = 0 25) primarily because of a shght departure from hnearity for birth weight
and the length of gestation among extreme gestation periods (> 46 weeks) Because the effects of the dummy vanables for race
are inturtively sumpler to interpret for birth weight in its standard, these results are presented in Table 5

In addition to the results presented, separate models were obtained for first, second, and third and higher birth orders These
models were essentially the same and are not presented Also, first-order interactions between the dummy variables for race and
all other independent variables were included in the mode! Two of the 36 first-order interaction terms barely achieved statistical
significance (p = 0 05) and were not included 1n the model because they were of little substantive importance

black mother and a white father, and the
third for a black mother and black father. The remaining combination of a
white mother and father comprises the
suppressed or reference category. In interpreting the results, each dummy variable reflects the effect of a specific racial
combination relative to white parents.
Table 5 contains the regression coefficients and standard errors for each independent variable and birth weight.
Table 5 shows that, as expected from
other research, length of gestation has
the largest effect on birthweight. The remaining obstetric/maternal variables
also have significant effects on birthweight which are consistent with previous studies. An increase in birth
weight is associated with higher order
parity, more frequent prenatal visits,
greater maternal age, and higher parental education, while a decrease in
birthweight is associated with greater
numbers of fetal deaths, later initiation
of prenatal care, and having black parent(s).

The dummy variables for race have
significant effects on birthweight. The
largest effect is seen for the category of
black mother and black father and
results in a birthweight decrement of 143
grams relative to the reference category
of white mother and white father. The
remaining combinations of parental
race also produce significant, but more
modest, decrements in birthweight. A

decrement of 78.3 grams is observed for
the combination of black mother and
white father, and a decrement of 46.1
grams is seen for white mother and
black father. Comparison of the coefficients for the parental race combinations lends support to the hypothesis
that maternal ethnic origin has more of
an effect on infant birthweight than paternal ethnic origin.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The results of this analysis support
both the theoretical propositions and
empirical results from other studies
which have suggested that birthweight
differentials are the result of both a genetic component and social and demographic factors. Although the amount of
variance in birthweight attributable to
the regression model is modest, the
combination of a black mother and father produces a birthweight decrement
of 142.3 grams, or 57 per cent of the total
observed black-white difference among
the study population. This value is consistent with previous research that reported that approximately one-half of
the black-white birthweight differential
is due to genetic factors.

Other results are also consistent with
prior research on the effects of social
and demographic factors on infant
birthweight. Increased birthweight is associated with higher order parity, more
frequent prenatal visits, higher maternal
age, and higher parental education,
while a decrease in birthweight is associated with greater numbers of fetal
deaths, later initiation of prenatal care,
and having black parent(s).

There are several implications of the
findings reported here. First, different
ethnic classification schemes can produce different estimates of the preva
Social Biology

lence of low birthweight. The estimate
of the proportion of black infants of low
birthweight using the race criteria employed by NCHS may be lower than that
obtained if the race criteria is a combination of the race of both parents. This
study has shown that newborns with one
white parent generally have higher
mean birthweights than newborns with
black parents. This finding suggests that
grouping infants of racially-mixed parents into the black category will yield an
artificially low proportion of lowbirthweight infants for the black population. The extent of the underestimate
will depend on the proportion of black
infants with a white parent. In addition,
such underestimates may vary by geographic area, since the incidence of
mixed-race marriages may vary from
one location to another. Substantial distortions are possible in states where the
likelihood of interracial marriage is
higher. In general, states that have a
large black population will experience
less distortion than will states where the
number of blacks is small. In this context, it is significant to note that the likelihood of interracial marriage is substantially higher in the states where there are
relatively smaller black populations.
The correlation between the per cent of
births to mixed-race couples and the log
of the per cent of the state’s population
which is black is —0.86.

At the national level, the per cent of
births classified as low weight increases
from 11.7 using the NCHS classification
of race to 12.0 when the more restrictive
definition (both parents are black) is
used. This modest difference represents
an additional 1,093 births. The total effect of including parents of mixed race is
slight because the proportion of mixed
race parents is fairly small (5.4 per cent).
However, when individual states are

considered, the effect of racial composition varies considerably. When only infants whose parents are both black are
considered in the category black, there
is no change in the percentage of lowweight black infants in four states, a
lower percentage in five states, and a
higher percentage in the remaining
states (analysis not shown).

Finally, measurement of low birthweight by the ethnicity of parents has
important implications for estimates of
infant mortality, particularly mortality
among low-birthweight infants. Ethnicity at death is classified according to the
ethnicity of the decedent; at birth, it is
classified according to the ethnicity of
the mother and father. Thus, infant
mortality is affected by the construction
of ethnicity, and mortality levels are
therefore partly an artifact of the data
rather than a characteristic of the ethnic
group itself. This discrepancy in the coding of ethnicity on birth and death records becomes more problematic as the

Infant Birthweight

number of events becomes smaller, as is
the case when the incidence of low
birthweight is assessed among minorities.

The study shows that mean birthweight differs according to ethnic classification and that there appear to be differences in mean birthweight by ethnicity within some gestational groups. This
finding suggests that a single criterion of
2,500 grams to define low-birthweight
infants may not be appropriate for all
populations. Alternative criteria should
be investigated. Better operational
measures of low birthweight are
needed, especially if low birthweight
continues to be used as an indicator of
inadequate prenatal care, poor nutrition, and the efficacy of maternal health
problems.
