ABSTRACT: Breastfeeding beyond the resumption of mother’s menstruation plays a significant
role in the proximate determinants of fertility. Breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhoea data
collected from retrospective surveys usually exhibit digit preferences. Here, these heaping errors
were smoothed by B-spline and used in multivariate models of risk of conception to investigate
the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding. The data used come from a 1987 Indian survey. Results
show that lactation, after mother’s menses resume, reduces the risk of conception. Heaping in
breastfeeding data attenuates this relationship. When adjustment is made, breastfeeding reduced
the rate of conception by 47 per cent; the reduction, with adjusted data, was 63 per cent.

Duration of the nonsusceptible period for conception due to postpartum
amenorrhoea (PPA) is a major determinant of birth intervals in populations
where contraceptive use is minimal.
This nonsusceptible period depends to
a large extent on breastfeeding practices, in that lactation postpones the return of ovulation after birth during
which time a woman cannot conceive.

Both empirical estimates (Habicht
et al., 1985; Huffman et al., 1987; John
et al., 1987; Jones, 1988; Santow,
1987) and simulation of birth interval
dynamics (Bongaarts and Menken,
1983) suggest that, in developing countries, breastfeeding also has a substantial contraceptive effect. Cleland et al.
(1984) have also shown that in Asia
and Africa lactation reduces total fecundity by 30 to 33 per cent, compared
to the reduction by contraception of
20 per cent in Asia and 5 per cent in
Africa. |

Many researchers have examined
the influence of lactation on the length
of PPA as well as on the waiting time to

conception once a woman has resumed
menses. Epidemiological and laboratory investigations confirm that lactation prolongs PPA and provides some
degree of protection against pregnancy
even after the resumption of menstruation (McCann et al., 1981; WHO,
1981).

The relationship between breastfeeding and PPA is well supported by
clinical evidence. High levels of anterior pituitary hormone, which suppresses normal ovarian function are
strongly related to breastfeeding.
When lactation continues for more
than a few months, the menses are
likely to return while the mother is still
breastfeeding. The duration of breastfeeding thus exceeds the length of
PPA, and that period can be partitioned into two components: breastfeeding during amenorrhoea and
breastfeeding during the menstrual
interval. How breastfeeding, after
return of menses, might affect the
waiting time to conception is usually
ignored.

230 Singh et al.

A basic factor that lengthens the
waiting time to conception is the period of postpartum anovulation. In
most studies, PPA duration is used as a
proxy for the duration of postpartum
anovulation. Ovulation is, however,
the phenomenon of real interest. Ovulation, not menstruation, makes a
woman able to conceive.

Breastfeeding may affect a woman’s
ability to conceive after resuming
menses via the production of prolactin.
Frequent and intense suckling results
in the production of high levels of prolactin, which in turn inhibits ovulation
(Lunn et al., 1984). Thus, women who
continue to breastfeed following the
resumption of menses may have a
higher incidence of anovulatory cycles
than those women who have weaned
their infants.

Continued breastfeeding beyond
the resumption of menstruation inhibits the transport of ova down the fallopian tubes and makes the luteal
phase inadequate for implantation
and sustaining pregnancy (McNeilly,
1988), suggesting an extended time to
conception after birth and thus lowering fecundability.

The reported duration of breastfeeding and PPA usually show digit
preference at months 3, 6, 9, 12, and so
on. Such heaping errors in data are
known to attenuate the relationships
on ordinary regression models. We examine the effect of such heaping errors
in studying the relationship between
breastfeeding and PPA in the context
of time-dependent hazards models,
where a B-spline smoothing technique
was used to adjust for the heaping errors in breastfeeding and PPA data.
Further, we examine the relationship
among PPA, breastfeeding after

Social Biology

menses resume, and waiting time to
conception with and without adjustments.

Splines are well known for their usefulness in providing a smooth approximation to a covariate function of unspecified form (Wold, 1974). Smith
(1982) employed B-spline in a linear
regression problem. O’Sullivan (1988)
used smoothing splines to estimate
nonlinear covariates in a Cox model.
Smoothing splines are effective for examining fine details of regression data
in exploratory analysis.

Apart from breastfeeding, socioeconomic and biological factors influence
the length or distribution of waiting
time to conception in a population
(Nath et al., 1993; Singh et al., 1993).
Although nutritional intake is also
known to influence fecundity, in this
study we have no direct information on
women’s nutritional intake. An alternative is to observe the standard of living of the concerned individual and
hence infer about food items. Based on
certain characteristics, household socioeconomic status has been defined
where it is assumed that individuals belonging to a household have the same
status. Other factors, such as religion
or caste, education, place of residence,
etc., are known to influence breastfeeding and _ nutritional behavior
(Huffman et al., 1987; Ramchandran,
1987; McCann et al., 1981; Diamond et
al., 1985; Srinivasan, et al., 1989;
Mukherjee et al., 1991; Nath et al.,
1993; Singh et al., 1993). In addition,
age also influences fecundity. Therefore, we examine here, through the
hazard modeling technique, the effect
of breastfeeding after menstruation
and PPA on the time of the next conception after controlling the above

mentioned socioeconomic and biological variables.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The basic data for our research
come from a retrospective survey,
“Breastfeeding and Its Effect on Fertility,” conducted in 1987 under the
auspices of the Centre of Population
Studies, Banaras Hindu University,
Varanasi, India, sponsored by the
University Grants Commission, New
Delhi. The survey’s main objective was
to obtain reliable data to study the pattern of breastfeeding and its effect on
fertility and to estimate biocultural
parameters of human reproduction in
traditional societies.

In this connection, several sociocultural, economic, and other factors accounting for variation in duration of
lactation and fertility were taken into
account. In addition to other information, data were collected relating to
age at marriage, total number of children ever born and surviving, including
details about duration variables—
lactation, PPA, timing of birth, etc.,
for births occurring within the last
seven years for each married, eligible
female in the household. Information
on women menstruating, pregnant,
amenorrheic, or menopausal was obtained, and those women who had
reached menopause were excluded.

The study is based on data from two
types of residential areas: 1,100 urban
and 900 rural households of Varanasi,
a district of Eastern Uttar Pradesh.
Varanasi city has been expanding, especially since 1960, by including neighboring villages into the city. The urban
households were selected from regions
included in the city area before this

Smoothed Breastfeeding Durations

231

time. Rural households were selected
from regions included in the urban
area during the last thirty years (Singh,
1991).

Several factors affect social status.
Social status in India, particularly, in
rural areas, is not only a function of
caste and landholding but also life-style
(Beteille, 1974). Distinctive life-styles
are determined through differences in
household educational status, housing,
etc. The expenditure of rural households is determined not only by their
income, but also by their aspirations
of either maintaining their status or
achieving upward social mobility. We
have classified eligible women into
three social-status groups: low, medium and high, by an aggregated score
that takes account of the following factors: (a) total household income; (b)
household educational status; (c) housing; (d) landholding; and (e) possession of luxuries (for details, see Singh,
1990). |

The caste has a socioreligious base.
Caste beliefs, therefore, exert a strong
and stable conditioning influence on
human behavior, social habits, customs, and practices. Segregated, casteoriented living as is commonly practiced in villages, reinforces caste beliefs
and habits. Therefore, the sample has
been subdivided into broad groups:
Muslims and upper, middle, and
scheduled castes among Hindus (Huffman, et al., 1987; Nath et al., 1993;
Srinivasan, 1989; Singh et al., 1994).

Mother’s age at childbirth is known
to be an important determinant in
analyzing the interval from resumption
of menses to next birth (Diamond et
al., 1986; John et al., 1987; Nath et
al., 1993). In countries such as India,
where preference for male children
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

232 ; Singh et al.

exists, breastfeeding patterns appear
to depend on the infant’s sex. In this
study, we have examined the roles of
woman’s age and child’s sex on the
interval of interest.

The study data consist of two types
of birth intervals. One is the closed interval for women who had experienced
at least two live-birth conceptions before the survey date—the interval between the two births. The other is the
open interval—the duration from the
date of birth of the last child to the survey date, for women who have not experienced a subsequent conception.
These open intervals provide information that the subsequent conception
time exceeds the time elapsed from the
date of the index child to the date of
survey. Only those open intervals are
considered in which the menses are resumed before the reference date of the
survey.

Because we have considered both
complete and incomplete intervals at
the time of survey, we used the life
table technique (Namboodiri and
Suchindran, 1987) to analyze the interval from resumption of menses to next
conception. Life tables of length for interval between resumption of menses
to next conception were constructed,
and summary measures such as median
length of the interval from resumption
of menses to next conception were
computed. We considered all closed
and open birth intervals that occurred
within the last seven years before the
reference date of the survey to reduce
recall lapse for intervals that began
very long ago. Since the use of contraception is almost negligible in the survey area, to observe the impact of
breastfeeding alone on the interval under study, we confined our analysis to

 

 

Social Biology

women who did not use any form of
contraception during the interval.

The multivariate analysis of the duration of the interval from resumption
of menses to next conception was
achieved through hazards modeling
(Cox, 1972). In the following models,
the probability of conception depends
on the elapsed duration of the menstrual interval and on a set of independent variables which describe the
woman and the environment in which
she lives. The independent variables
fall into two classes: (1) fixed characteristics, which take the same value in
every month of observation for a given
woman, such as her religion and caste,
household socioeconomic status, education, place of residence, etc.; and the
variable characteristics, such as breastfeeding status which may take a different value in each month of observation. Because of this time-dependent
nature of the breastfeeding variable,
special attention was paid to obtain
data on breastfeeding duration after
resumption of menses and the interval
between resumption of menses and
next conception. The breastfeeding
variables were examined in two separate specifications, done to ease interpretational difficulties with timedependent covariates and to reduce
computer costs. The first model specifies the hazard of the event ‘“‘conception after resumption of menses” (A[t])
as follows:

log M(t) = log Ag(t) + BX + Bo
BREAST (1) (1)

where A,(t) is a baseline hazard, X is a
set of fixed covariates, and BREAST(t)
is an indicator variable assuming a
value 1 if the woman is breastfeeding t
months after resumption of menses
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

Vol. 41, No. 3-4

and 0 if she is not breastfeeding. The B,
and B, are unknown regression coefficients. Note that the indicator variable
BREAST(¢t) simply examines whether
or not breastfeeding status after resumption of menses at a given time
(current status) influences the rate of
conception at that time. Also, by interacting an independent variable with
the BREAST(?) variable, one can examine the question whether the effect
of current breastfeeding status after
menses on the rate of conception varies
among subgroups of the population defined by the variable. However, such
specification of the breastfeeding after
the return of menses variable does not
account for the duration of breastfeeding, if it has stopped prior to the time
point at which the hazard is estimated.
To include the duration of breastfeeding, the following specification of the
model was used:

log A(t) = log Ao(t) + BX +
B.D(t) + BsLX*D(t)] (2)

where D(t) = minimum (tf, duration of
breastfeeding after resuming menses).
Note that for women who _ have
stopped breastfeeding before t, D(t)
will be the duration of breastfeeding;
and for those still continuing breastfeeding, D(t) will be the time point
of consideration. Such specifications
avoid the problem of indicating breastfeeding durations after menses longer
than that of the length of interval from
return to menses to next conception.
The £8; coefficients measure the interactive effects of the duration of breastfeeding after menses and the set of independent variables.

Before applying the multivariate
time-dependent hazards models, the
data on duration of breastfeeding and

233

PPA were smoothed by using B-spline
functions (SAS, 1990).

RESULTS

The median duration of total (full
and partial) breastfeeding after resumption of menses was calculated for
females in the study by univariate life
table technique (Table 1). The overall
median duration of breastfeeding is
seen to be 16.26 and 13.35 months, respectively, with and without smoothing. Median durations of PPA obtained
through life tables are also shown in
Table 1. The median duration of PPA
was found to be 7.82 and 5.82 months,
respectively, with and without-smoothing. Life tables show that a high percentage of females resume menses before 3 months (not shown). This may
be, in part, confusion of postpartum
bleeding with first menses. There may
also be downward bias in the median
duration of PPA compared to the general population because we are considering only intervals in which PPA is
already completed. Hence, the data
may be over-represented by females
who have shorter durations of PPA.
Smoothing, in general, increased the
average durations of breastfeeding and
PPA.

We also present the median duration from resumption of menses to next
conception (Table 1). For closed (uncensored) intervals at the time of survey, the time of conception was estimated by subtracting 9 months from
the month of delivery. In the present
study the status of females at the time
of survey (pregnant or not) was known
but the duration of pregnancy was not
known. So, for females pregnant at the
time of survey, the time of conception

was assigned by generating the duration of pregnancy by drawing a random
number from a uniform distribution of
a range of 8 months and treating these
intervals as closed. The rest of the intervals are considered to be censored
at the time of survey. The overall median duration of waiting time to conception after menstruation is found to
be more than 15 months.

Table 2 presents the percentage distribution of females who were pregnant or nonpregnant at the time of survey by selected characteristics. Much
variation is observed according to
pregnant status at the time of survey in
two characteristics: place of residence,
age of female at birth, and religion/
caste.

In Table 3 we give the results from
fitting the first model with and without
smoothing breastfeeding by cubic
splines respectively. We have examined here the effect of current breastfeeding status on the hazard of conception. The regression analysis indicates
that breastfeeding beyond menstruation at any given time reduces significantly the likelihood of conception,

Social Biology

even after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics under study in
both cases.

Comparison of the results from the
analysis indicates that heaping of
breastfeeding and PPA (Table 3) show
reduced effect on the chance of conception after menstruation. This finding means that if no smoothing adjustment is made, the rate of conception
after menstruation is reduced by 47 per
cent if the female is breastfeeding at
that time. When smoothing adjustment is made, the reduction increases
to 63 per cent, consistent with the attenuation effect of errors in variables
noted in the regression model literature.

Many other factors included in the
model also have a significant effect.
Younger mothers at the child’s birth
have significantly higher rates of conception after return of menses than
older mothers in both cases. Literate
women have less chance of conception
than the illiterate after menses; the difference is highly statistically significant. Rural women have a significantly
smaller interval from menses to next
conception than do urban women. The
model was re-estimated by adding the
interaction terms of the current status
of breastfeeding after menses and
other independent variables. None of
the interaction terms are found to be
Statistically significant either before
and after smoothing the breastfeeding
and PPA.

The regression coefficient from the
model specifying breastfeeding duration after menses and its interactive
effect with duration of PPA with and
without smoothing adjustment are
given in Tables 4 and 5 respectively.

Results from Model 1 in Tables 4 and 5
show that breastfeeding duration has a
significant negative effect on the rate of
conception after menses. For every additional month of breastfeeding, there
is about a 1.8 per cent (3.3 per cent)
reduction in the risk of conception
after return of menses without (with)
smoothing breastfeeding and PPA.
The results once again show the attenuating effect of the heaping in duration
data.

Model 2 in Table 4 examines the interactive effect of breastfeeding after
menses on the risk of conception. The

interactive effect of breastfeeding with
the duration of PPA is found to be statistically significant. Results show that
if there is no breastfeeding, as the duration of PPA increases so does the risk
of conception. However, breastfeeding
attenuates the positive effect of duration of PPA. Here, smoothing increases the effect of breastfeeding
duration on the risk of conception.

DISCUSSION

Waiting time to a conception is
an important indicator of fecundity.

Biomedical evidence suggests that
continued breastfeeding, even after
menses have returned, may inhibit the
return of normal ovarian function, and
hence fecundity. Analysis shows that
breastfeeding after menstruation observed as a current status or breastfeeding duration has a significant effect
on the interval from resumption of
menses to next conception. The results
further show that the risk of conception after menstruation varies significantly by mother’s residence, age, and
religion/caste.

A study of the relationship between
breastfeeding and waiting time to conception is complicated by the heaping
errors in the breastfeeding data. In ordinary regression models, it is known
that the regression coefficient of a variable measured with error is reduced
by a factor equivalent to its reliability
(Fuller, 1987). Similar results in the
context of hazards models with time
dependents are not available in the literature. We show that heaping errors
can significantly reduce the main effects. Also, the interactive effect of

solute value by smoothing the duration
of breastfeeding and PPA.

Regardless of adjustments in the
breastfeeding data, breastfeeding after
menses is found to have significant
impact on waiting time to conception.
This result shows that breastfeeding
after menses has a significant contraceptive effect.
