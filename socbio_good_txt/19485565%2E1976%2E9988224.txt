An Unusual Live-birth Sex Ratio in Ecuador

Stephen Beckerman*

Department of Anthropology
University of New Mexico
Albuquerque, New Mexico

In his study of the Peruvian village of
Nufioa, Baker (1969) reports “the sex ratio
was highly unusual in that there was a
large number of excess males.” Specifically, fora sample of 608 children born to 136
women, he records a sex ratio of 124. In
this note I want to call the attention of
human biologists to a village in Ecuador
that may manifest this phenomenon of a
male-skewed sex ratio in an even more
extreme form.

The town of Oyacachi is a settlement of
peasantized Indians, some of whom are
still] monolingual in Quechua, located
about 40 kilometers due east of Quito. As
of 1967, the population (excluding a school
teacher, a teniente politico and his son,
and a storekeeper and her son, all of
whom were white Ecuadorian nationals)
was enumerated in a locally conducted
census as 179 persons.

Located as it is on the eastern slope of
the Andes, at an altitude of nearly 3,000
meters, the town has always been difficult
to reach and unattractive to white colonization. In the spring of 1969, when I visited the town for several months of ethnographic field work, the easiest route to
Oyacachi was a full day’s horseback ride
across the Andean divide.

The original vegetation, still present in
large parts of the environs, is cloud forest.
The people raise about half their own food
and earn the money to buy the rest, as well

as all their tools, clothes, etc., by a cottage
industry—the hand carving of large
wooden spoons, bowls, and trays.

In the course of my field work, I examined the civil register of the town, which
had been established as a separate register
only in 1959. In the ten years in which the
register had been maintained, there had
been 77 live births, of which 27 were
female and 50 were male, yielding a sex
ratio of 185.2.

It is important to stress that this figure
refers to the sex ratio at birth and not to
the total population. A fair number of
cases of extreme sex ratios have been collected by Salzano (1972). However, all
these cases refer to total populations and
thus could be the result of female infanticide (ethnographically known for some of
these groups), differential survival, and
differential emigration.

Of these complicating factors, only
female infanticide could have affected the
Oyacachi data. I am satisfied that infanticide is not a valid explanation of the
skewed sex ratio for the following reasons:

1. Oyacachi has been Catholic for centuries and has normal Catholic peasant
values in regard to this practice.

2. The teniente politico, who had been
resident in the town for a good many years
and was generally well regarded, would
almost certainly have become aware of
any systematic infanticide. However, he
attributed the sex ratio to unknown
causes.

3. Little girls are valued in Oyacachi
and, if anything, are better treated than
little boys. The ten-year records in the
civil register of the children under five
years of age who had died listed eleven
males and eight females.

4. The figure of 77 births in ten years
for a population of 179 gives a crude birth
rate of 43 per 1,000, which is very slightly
lower than the range of figures given by
Baker and Dutt (1972) for Andean populations. To assume that the Oyacachi sex
ratio had been achieved by female infanticide would necessitate raising the total
birth rate to about 54 per 1,000. While this
figure is in the midrange of those given by
Baker and Dutt (1972), it seems unlikely in
view of the sex ratio of the whole population which the 1967 census showed as 105
males to 72 females. Many of these
females had married in from neighboring
villages. Thus, a production of 54 children
per 1,000 total individuals would have
been equivalent to a crude birth rate of 73
per 1,000 individuals in a population with
a normal proportion of females.

Such a rate is not impossible. In fact,
Baker and Dutt (1972) record an even
higher crude birth rate at an even higher
altitude. However, this rate is certainly
unlikely, especially in view of the findings
of James (1966), Heer (1967), and Baker
and Dutt (1972) on the general negative
correlation between altitude and fertility.

5. The people of Oyacachi are of course
aware that the shortage of female births
makes for a shortage of adult women in
the village, a condition they regard as anything but a blessing.

Accepting the sexual imbalance as
genuine, then, brings up the question of
just how exceptional it really is. Taking a
normal sex ratio at birth of 106.1 males to
100 females (Colombo, 1957), the 77 recorded births in Oyacachi could have been
expected to distribute as 39.64 to 37.36.
The observed sex ratio of 50 males to 27

females permits the calculation of a chisquare statistic of 5.59. With one degree of
freedom, the alpha is slightly less than
0.025.

While a probability of 0.025 hardly represents a vanishingly unlikely event, there
are additional data which lower the probability to the point at which one may begin
to entertain very serious doubts that the
phenomenon is the result of random fluctuation.

While in Ecuador, I was able to assemble, for purposes relating to an examination of patterns of village endogamy and
exogamy, the genealogy of a substantial
fraction of the total population of Oyacachi. The genealogy was compiled by interviews and by the examination of the civil
register of Oyacachi itself and of the
neighboring villages in which Oyacachi
vital statistics were formerly recorded.
The final product comprised 168 people,
113 of whom were still living at the time of
my field work and all of whom were supposed to be related either by birth or marriage to at least one of five ancestral
husband-wife pairs.

The genealogy is open to some doubt, as
it contains a number of dead children
whose births were remembered but whose
sex was forgotten, in addition to a few
relationships that may be inaccurate.
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the
vast majority of the relationships indicated there are correct. The maximum
depth of the genealogy is only six generations, and the preponderance of individuals is in the —1 generation. From the 49
marriages and one illegitimate birth recorded on the genealogy, there were produced 121 children of known sex, 76 males
and 45 females.

This sample is significantly larger than
that found in the birth register. Although
the sex ratio is slightly smaller (173.3 as
compared to 185.2), the greater number of
cases permits the calculation of a chiDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

square alpha of only slightly more than
0.01.

As a further test of the nature as well as
the genuineness of the phenomenon, one
can extract from the genealogy all the sibling sets of each size class (i.e., all the cases
of single-child families, of two-child
families, and so forth) and test these cases
against the sexual distribution in each size
class predicted by the overall sex ratio
taken from the genealogy. When this is
done, Oyacachi families of each size class
are found to conform to the predicted
abundance of male and female children
just about as well as they can without
having fractional children. The conformance improves regularly as family size
goes up, and in no case is the alpha less
than about 0.5. There is no suggestion that
the proclivity for an excess of males is
concentrated in a few families; the ratio
seems to be remarkably regular throughout the whole population.

Although the case for the significance of
the Oyacachi phenomenon has been argued here largely in isolation, it is germane
to add that the existence of a similar phenomenon in Nunoa adds a great deal of
credence to the supposition that this is indeed a nonrandom occurence which requires investigation. The fact that the two
populations are ethnically and geographi
Social Biology

cally close allows the hope that intensive
field work in Oyacachi would allow at
least a partial untangling of the bewildering variety of factors which Teitelbaum
(1972) summarizes as having been proposed to influence sex ratio.

The recent opening of the Ecuadorian
oil fields at Lago Agria has impelled the
cutting of a road through a pass only
twenty kilometers south of Oyacachi. A
house trail connects Oyacachi itself to this
road, which now has daily bus service between Quito and the oil camps. The
economic opportunities attendant upon
the road traffic, and the oil wealth itself,
will almost certainly accelerate the emigration from the village which had already
begun when I visited six years ago. Whatever factor is so strikingly manifested in
Oyacachi may soon be removed from the
population and/or diluted by greatly increased out-marriage.

I have prepared this brief report in the
hope of arousing interest in the further
investigation of this phenomenon.
