Further Data on Inbreeding Levels

in Brazilian Populations

Lucia G. da Fonseca and N. Freire-Maia

Laboratory of Human Genetics
Federal University of Parand
Curitiba, Parand, Brazil

Inbreeding levels of Brazilian populations have been estimated by different methods and through several surveys (see review
in Salzano and Freire-Maia, 1970). Since
estimates for large areas (dioceses and
states) have been mostly made on the basis
of a survey carried out around 1954 (FreireMaia, 1957a), it seemed worthwhile to obtain a new series of data for two basic purposes: (a) to ascertain the situation in those
extensive regions for which little or no information had been gathered before; and (8)
to evaluate the present situation as compared with that shown in the 1957 paper.

Only data on Roman Catholic marriages
were obtained, through questionnaires sent
by mail to the ecclesiastical authorities in
each diocese. On the problem of extrapolating from these data to the whole population
and on some methodological details, see
Freire-Maia (1957a).

Our data (together with estimates of F,
the coefficient of inbreeding) are presented
in Table 1. They support previous conclusions that inbreeding rates are “‘relatively
low” in the South (States 1-4) and part of

the East (5-7) (F approximately 0.0005),
“moderately high” in another part of the
East (8-10) (F generally from 0,002 to
0.005) and “very high” in the interior of the
Northeast (11-17), with many values of F
between 0.005 and 0.009). The Center-West
and the North (18-23) show “low” and
“‘moderate” inbreeding rates ( from lower
than 0.0005 to 0.0036).

These data refer to entire dioceses which
encompass a large number of localities and
their respective surrounding rural areas.
Naturally, local rates of inbreeding may be
much higher, say, between 0.01 and 0.02
(Freire-Maia, 1957<,0).

Our present data (although also not covering extensive areas of the Brazilian territory) suggest that some of our previous estimates of inbreeding rates for the Brazilian
states and regions, as well as for the whole
country (Table 5 of Freire-Maia, 1957a),
could be overestimates. This seems particularly true for those areas with large parts
uncovered by our first survey. A guess based
on the “probable” rates of inbreeding of
these zones with unknown inbreeding levels

had to be introduced at that time into the
estimates. In some cases, the ‘‘approximate
degrees of accuracy” of these estimates were
considered to be “low” or “poor” (FreireMaia, 1957a).

By comparing the previous values of F
from Freire-Maia (1957a) with the most recent ones of Table 1, we verify that among
the 40 dioceses appearing in both about
three-fourths (i.e., 29) now have lower rates
(Table 2). It is interesting to note that the
South (the most developed region) contributes about half (19) of those 40 dioceses, and

among them only one example of increase is
found. In the rest of the country, there are
10 cases of increase in a total of 21 dioceses.
To explain the high heterogeneity of the
inbreeding levels in the Brazilian territory,
a number of factors have been suggested and
analyzed: economic development, demographic density, religious structure, illiteracy, migration, “cultural” pattern, ethnic
composition, ruralization, etc, (Freire-Maia,
1958; Salzano and Freire-Maia, 1970).
Another point to be mentioned is that
our values of F are to be accepted as underestimates, since only frequencies of consanguineous marriages up to and including second cousins have been used. It is to be noted, however, that all the situations with
multiple consanguinity, provided their degrees are equal to, or higher than, second
cousins, have been used for estimating F;
only “remote” consanguinity (below second
cousins) was disregarded. This is due to a
methodological deficiency somewhat similar
to that also found in investigations based on
pedigree ascertainments made on the basis
of information provided by the spouses.
For a comparison of the Brazilian rates
of inbreeding with those from other countries, see Freire-Maia (19576, 1968, 1970).

Social Biology

Here, we will only mention that, as pointed
out by Freire-Maia (1968), some regions and
localities in Brazil present inbreeding levels
respectively 100 and 250 times higher than
that estimated for the American Catholic
population as a whole (F = 0.00008).

SUMMARY

New data are presented on the frequencies of consanguineous marriages in a number of Brazilian dioceses. Estimates of F
vary from lows of 0.0005 up to 0.009. In
spite of the fact that there is a tendency for
decreasing inbreeding rates with time, some
examples of increases have been verified in
the last fifteen years. This and some other
aspects of the problem are briefly analyzed.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Weare very grateful to the chancellors of the
Brazilian dioceses and archdioceses, without
whose cooperation this investigation would have
been impossible.

Our research projects are supported by
grants from the National Research Council of
Brazil, the Rockefeller Foundation, the World
Health Organization, the Calouste Gulbenkian
Foundation, and the Research Council of the
Federal University of Paran4. This investigation was specially supported by the National
Research Council of Brazil. Mrs. Fonseca held
a fellowship from this institution during the
period of the investigation.
