ABSTRACT: A general multifactorial model is given for the inheritance of traits that exhibit a sexual
dimorphism. The model allows for polygenic inheritance, cultural transmission, phenotypic assortative mating, and a common environment of rearing. Several cultural mechanisms are described
for which transmission from parent to offspring is sex-dependent and for which many different patterns of sex-specific correlations can result. A special case of the general model is described in which
phenotypic differences between males and females are due only to differences in nontransmissible
environmental factors and/or genetic factors that do not contribute to variability within a sex. Application of these models to human spatial visualizing ability, using data reported by others, gives
an estimate of 45 per cent for the proportion of the variance that is accounted for by transmissible
factors. Neither an X-linked hypothesis nor a sex-specific cultural mechanism is required to explain
the transmission of spatial ability.

ences. They emphasize the plasticity of
genotypes in response to their environments and deal explicitly with the effect of
phenotype-to-phenotype transmission.
Morton (1974) and Rao et al. (1974, 1976)
have developed a general linear model of
familial resemblance using path analytic
techniques to incorporate both an index of
home environment and cultural transmission. They describe the effects of secondary assortative mating due to social homogamy and have recently included direct
phenotypic assortment (Rao et al., 1979).

Rice et al. (1978, 1980) and Cloninger
et al. (1979a,b) have described two
models which allow for combined polygenic and cultural transmission, primary
or secondary phenotypic assortative mating, correlated environments of rearing,
and variable family structure. The BETA
Model (Cloninger et al., 1979a,b) is appropriate when separation data are available and explicitly contains as parameters
both h?, the (narrow) heritability, and b?,
the proportion of the phenotypic variance
due to cultural transmission. This model
has recently been used by Rice et al.
(1980) in their analysis of IQ and SES (socioeconomic status) data. The TAU
Model (Rice et al., 1978, 1980) is appropriate when data are available only for individuals who are reared in intact nuclear
families. The model assumes that a phenotype P may be partitioned as P = T + E,
where T denotes both genetic and cultural
factors which are transmissible from
parent to offspring and £ denotes all other
effects with COV (7,E) = 0. Familial resemblance is determined by the following
two structural equations given in terms of
standardized variables:

P=tT+eE, (1)
T,=1,Tet+tyTytrR, (2)

when M, F and O denote mother, father
and offspring, respectively. The path

coefficients (standardized partial regression coefficients) tf and e are given bya,/
opando,/oa,, respectively, so that? + e?

measure the relative contribution to the
offspring’s phenotype made by each
parent, and R, with path coefficient r, is
the residual term of the regression equation which is assumed uncorrelated with
T,,and T;. In the case of polygenic inheritance, T,, and t, would be one-half and R
would be segregation from midparent
genotype. The TAU model also allows for
a correlation between the phenotypes of
mates and a correlation between the E’s of
individuals reared together.

In this paper we shall extend the TAU
Model to allow for the distributions of
both T and E to differ for males and females as well as to allow for the 7’s to depend both upon the sex of the parent and
the sex of the offspring. This model,
termed the TAU Model With Sex Effect,
allows for differences in the means of
males and females as well as for sex differences in correlations. Using this model,
we demonstrate that cultural inheritance
can lead to many different sex-dependent
patterns of familial correlations. In contrast, such patterns may be difficult to explain when only genetic transmission is
considered.

THE THEORETICAL MODELS
THE GENERAL MODEL

Consider a quantitative phenotype P’
for which the distributions P,'’ and P,’ of
males and females, respectively, may be
partitioned as

Pi =a,+T7,' + E (3)
PP,’ =a,+ T,' + Ey’. (4)

We adopt the conventions of using a prime
for variables which are not standardized

and of using 1 and 2 to denote males and
females, respectively. In Equations (3)
and (4) we assume the means of T, and E,
are 0 and that P’ is measured on a scale
where males have mean a, and females
have mean a,. The variables T,’ denote
the effects of all factors relevant to the development of P,’ and which are transmissible from a parent of sexi to an offspring of
either sex and E£,’ denote the effects of all
other factors relevant to the development
of P,’. It is assumed that COV (T7,’, E,') =
0,2 = 1,2.

In terms of standardized variables,
Equations (3) and (4) yield the path equations:

P,=t,T,+e,E£,, (S)

tl

P,=0,T, + e, E,, (6)
where the path coefficients t, and e, are
given by ft; = o,;,/ op; and e, = o,;/ O>p;.
Family resemblance is determined by the
path equations

To; = 7:7, + TT, + 7, R;, (7)

where T.,,, 7, and T, denote the 7's of an
offspring of sex i, the father and the
mother, respectively, and R;an uncorrelated residual. The path coefficients 7, are
standardized partial regression
coefficients which measure the contribution of a parent of sex i to an offspring of
sex j. As noted by Rice et al. (1978, 1980),
direct phenotypic assortative mating is
described by the path equation

P,=mP,+uU, (8)

where m is the phenotypic correlation between mates and U is an uncorrelated residual. Finally, we allow for correlationsc,,
between the nontransmissible environment £,and £, of full siblings of sex: andj
who are reared together.

which must be equal.

EQUIDISTRIBUTIONAL SUBMODELS

Consider the special case of T,’ = T,'
= T’ and E,’ = E,' = E'. Then Equations (3) and (4) reduce to

parent-offspring and sibling data. They
also allow the description of a wide variety
of plausible cultural mechanisms for the
transmission of a phenotype when a sexual
dimorphism is present.

Equations (10) and (11) show that in
general the father-daughter and motherson correlations need not be equal. Even
in the case in which all the 1,’s are equal,
assortative mating will introduce an asymmetry in these two correlations. In the
case of polygenic transmission with all 7,,
= Vr, we have 7,512 — “yon = Yam (LZ — #),
so that the two correlations will be unequal when ¢, # ¢,. This can result either
from males and females having different
genes involved in the expression of the
phenotype or from males and females having the same 7” in Equations (3) and (4)
but different phenotypic variances. Such
an asymmetry does not apply, of course,

and P,’ and P,’ differ only in their means.
Such a difference in mean phenotypic
values may result either from a systematic
cultural bias which differentially applies to
one sex or from systematic biological differences between the sexes. These differences are systematic in the sense that
there are no interfamilial differences, the
same familial and random environmental
factors govern the variation of both sexes
about their respective means. In this case
t, = t, = t, and differences in sex-specific
correlations result from differences in sexspecific parent-offspring transmission.
Some of the possible paradigms are illustrated in Table 1. For some of these
models, the residuals R, and R, (see Equation 7) are assumed here to compensate
for the different degree of parental determination of 7, and 7,. However, the

Daughter Effect and Cross Sex Effect
models could lead to different ts. These
equidistributional models are easily generalized to allow for t,#t,.

For the Maternal Effects Model, we assume that the mother and father contribute to an offspring’s phenotype to different degrees in a way that does not
depend on the offspring’s sex. In many
contemporary cultures the mother tends
to have a greater share in child rearing, so
that for some phenotypes we may expect
Ty > Tr, Where T,,and 7, represent the contribution from the mother and father, respectively, to an offspring.

For the Daughter Effects Model, we assume each parent contributes equally, but
that the total parental contribution depends on the sex of the offspring. As a result, the 7, of the other sex is to a greater
extent determined by nonfamilial environmental factors. Such a model may
apply in a culture in which offspring of one
sex receive more parental supervision or
attention or are given less exposure to outside activities. For example, if exposure to
certain factors in the teenage years are relevant to the development of a phenotype,
and male offspring are given greater
freedom to explore nonfamilial situations
during these years, we may expect daughters to more closely resemble their
parents. The contributions from a parent
to ason or daughter are denoted by, and
74, respectively.

For the Cross Sex Effects Model, we assume that offspring of one sex are
influenced to a greater (or lesser) extent
by a parent of the opposite sex. This
model would apply to phenotypes where
gender identification or sex-role modeling
were relevant to etiology. The influence
between a parent and same-sex offspring
is denoted by 7+,,, and between a parent
and opposite-sex offspring by 7,,. Some
psychodynamic interpretations of personality development would be expected

to conform to this model. When

parent of the opposite sex, T,, > 7,, and

greater than or equal tor,,,.. This follows
from Equations (13) and (14) and the inequality that 7,2 + 1,22 21,,7,,. This last
inequality may be seen by expanding
(1,, —To,)? = 0.

The parameters of these models are m,
r, the t’s given in Table 1, and the c,/’s.
The equality of the sibling correlations in
Table 1 occurs when all c,’s are equal, so
that the inclusion of sex specific c’s will
provide more degrees of freedom to allow
their estimation.

A test of fit of these models may be
done by testing whether the predicted pattern of equality of correlations occurs.
However, for many of these models, the
underlying parameters cannot be estimated from parent-offspring and sibling
data alone. For example, the No Sex Effect Model has four parameters, m, f, 7,
and c, but only three parameters can be estimated since the model can be reparameterized in terms of the parameters m, r,,
and r,,. Estimation of the four parameters
would require observations on another
class of relatives or the making of a priori
assumptions such ast = %.,

THE ENVIRONMENTAL MODEL

In this section we will make the assumption that all 7,’s are equal to a common 7, and that 7,’ and T,’ of Equations
(3) and (4) are equal to a common T. By
equality, we mean that T, and T, are random variables drawn from the same distribution of phenotypic effects of transmissible elements or, in other words, the
transmissible elements and their ultimate
phenotypic effects are the same for both

Vol. 27, No. 1

males and females, so that both parents
are identical with respect to their influence
on an offspring’s T. This model, termed
the Environmental Model, is given by the
structural equations

Pi =a,+T+Ey, (18)
Py =a,+Tt+ Ey, (19)

To=tTp+tTytrR, (20)

where O, F, M, denote the offspring,
father and mother, respectively. The difference in the phenotypic distributions of
males and females is due only to the effects of nontransmissible factors or biological factors that do not show variability
within a sex. If the variance of E, and £,
are equal, but a,#a,, as in the case of systematic cultural or biological differences
discussed previously, then males and females will have the same variance and
only differ in their means, so that all
parent-offspring correlations will be
equal. If, however, £,’ and E,’ have different variances, then the variances of P,’
and P,' will differ, and the path
coefficients ¢, and ¢, will be unequal, even
though the phenotypes differ only for environmental reasons. In such a model, the
standardized path equations might mislead an investigator (Duncan, 1975). Indeed, all sex differences could be explained by the two phenotypes differing
only in their reliability of measurement.
Note, however, that the standard polygenic model is a special case of the Environmental Model, so that a fit to this
model does not imply the presence of
cultural transmission. ‘Environmental’
here only refers to the implication that ift,
+ t,, then this difference is explained by
differences in nontransmissible factors,
Moreover, even ift, = ¢,, itis possible that
the means of males and females are the
same, so that a fit to the Environmental
Model does not imply an environmental

origin for differences in the means of
males and females.

By setting all the t,’s equal tot in Equations (9) through (15), we obtain the following two relationships among the
phenotypic correlations:

Ypo12 "por = Tpors “p0229 (21)

loo12 = (roo ~ Cy €,?)
(7.922 — Coz C22) + Cy €1 €2. (22)

If observations satisfy these two equations, and there 1s a reduced variance for
the sex with the higher same-sex correlation, then the Environmental Model
should be considered as a likely explanation of the data. Ifm is zero, and allc,’s are
zero, then

so that the phenotypic correlations themselves may be used in a test of fit to the

et al. (1979) for a two-disease model and
applied to data on diastolic hypertension.

THE SEX EFFECT MODEL FOR
SEMICONTINUOUS TRAITS

The multifactorial model for threshold
characters has been described by Falconer
(1965, 1967), Reich et al. (1972, 1975) and
Curnow and Smith (1975). In this model it
is assumed that the manifestation of a
qualitative trait is governed by a normally
distributed variable X, termed the liability
scale. Affectational status is determined
by a threshold, with an individual being
“affected” if his score on X is above the
threshold and “unaffected” otherwise.

42 Rice et al

For the sex effect model, we assume hiability scales Y, and X, for males and females,
respectively.

The above models are formulated in
terms of X, and X, and their correlations
between relatives, together with the
threshold values for males and females.
The correlations between relatives may be
estimated using the tetrachoric correlation
coefficient (Rice et al., 1979) and the
threshold values from population prevalences. Although the models for qualitative
traits require the prevalences of affected
males and females as two additional parameters, direct estimates are usually available and may be incorporated into an
analysis.

In the case of semicontinuous traits, a
sexual dimorphism on the (unobserved)
liability scales is reflected as differences in
frequencies on the observed qualitative
scales.

APPLICATIONS OF THE MODELS

alizing ability, a trait which exhibits
markedly different distributions in males
and females. Maximum-likelihood parameter estimates were obtained from reported correlations using a FORTRAN
program XTAU, available upon request.
The likelihood function was computed as
described by Rice et al. (1978), and the
general purpose searching program
MAXLIK (Kaplan and Elston, 1972) was
used for maximization.

Several studies of spatial ability had
suggested the influence of an X-linked major locus in the transmission of spatial ability (Stafford, 1961; Hartlage, 1970; Bock
and Kolakowski, 1973). However, more
recent studies have cast doubt upon this
hypothesis (DeFries et al., 1976; Bouchard and McGee, 1977; Loehlin et al.,
1978; Park et al., 1978). The reported
parent-offspring correlations from these
latter studies are displayed in Table 2
along with the sample size (number of
pairs of relatives) given in parentheses. A
test of equality of the four sex-specific
parent-offspring correlations is reported
in the last column (Snedecor and Coch

The last row of Table 2 consists of correlations obtained by pooling those of
Bouchard and McGee (1978) and Loehlin
et al. (1978). Each pooled correlation was
obtained by taking the weighted sum of
the two corresponding Z-transformed correlations and then taking the inverse Ztransformation (Snedecor and Cochran,
1967). The “effective” sample size (the
sum of the two sample sizes less three) for
the pooled correlations is given in parentheses. |

The sibling correlations reported by
Bouchard and McGee (1978) and Loehlin
et al. (1978) are displayed in Table 3. The
former set of correlations and the pooled
correlations were found to be heterogeneous at the 0.05 significance level while
those of Loehlin et al. (1978) were not,
reflecting their small sample sizes. We
shall apply the above models to the pooled
correlations reported in Tables 2 and 3 after giving a brief description of the two
samples.

The sample of Bouchard and McGee
(1978) consisted of 801 individuals from
200 families ascertained through University of Minnesota undergraduate students.
The students were administered the Mental Rotation Test (Vandenberg, 1975) and
the Hidden Patterns Test and were then
trained to administer these tests to their

Spatial Visualizing Ability 43

family members between the ages of 11
and 69. The correlations in Tables 2 and 3
are the reported Mental Rotation Test
correlations after correcting for age using
Z scores in five-year age intervals. Bouchard and McGee also report that only 20
per cent of females scored above the male
median.

The sample of Loehlin et al. (1978)
consisted of 192 families in the Tel Aviv
area. Each family contained a father,
mother, and two children at least 13 years
of age with an upper limit of 60 years of
age for the parents. Families were tested
in their homes with a battery of tests
adapted from the Educational Testing
Service Kit of cognitive tests. Scores were
adjusted using a multiple regression equation with years of education, birth rank,
and a quadratic in age as independent variables. The correlations displayed in
Tables 2 and 3 are age-adjusted scores
based on a composite scale derived from
scores on card rotations, cube comparisons, hidden patterns, and paper folding.
Loehlin et al. also report that the mean
score for males was significantly higher
than that for females.

The results of the analyses are displayed in Table 4. Parameter estimates for
separate analyses of the two data sets are
displayed in brackets to allow monitoring
of the effect of pooling. To obviate the
problem of indeterminance, tT was fixed at
0.5 in all of the analyses. The program

“Parameter estimates for Bouchard and McGee (1978) and Loehlin et al. (1978), respectively, are displayed in brackets.

XTAU was used to estimate m, t,, t,, Ci,
C,,, and c,, and then used to test linear constraints placed upon the parameters. The
resulting maximum-likelihood parameter
estimates are displayed in Table 4 together with chi-square goodness-of-fit
Statistics. Tests of the linear constraints
are performed using the likelihood ratio
test (Kendall and Stuart, 1973), since the
difference in the chi-squares of the constrained and unconstrained models is
asymptotically a chi-square random variable whose degrees of freedom are given by
the number of constraints.

In the present application, the log likelihood function differs from the reported
goodness-of-fit chi-squares by a multiplicative factor of minus one-half and by a
constant which is independent of the parameters of the model. This constant cancels
when the difference of two such chisquares is taken, so that the value of the
difference of the chi-squares of the constrained and unconstrained models is
identical to the value of the likelihoodratio chi-square (Rao et al., 1974). This
test is more powerful than the chi-square
goodness-of-fit test, which is appropriate
when testing against an unspecified alternative hypothesis.

We first fitted the full six parameter
model to the data with no constraints and
obtained the parameter estimates displayed in Table 4. The goodness-of-fit chi
square is obtained by adding the squared
differences of the observed and predicted
Z-transformed correlations. The degrees
of freedom are given by the number of observed correlations less the number of estimated parameters, which yields 8-6 = 2
degrees of freedom for the model with no
constraints. This model provided a good
description of the data (x2 = 0.25, 0.75 <
p <0.90).

The hypothesis that t, = t, is accepted
(x? = 0.64 - 0.25 = 0.39, p > 0.5), in
agreement with the acceptance of the
equality of the parent-offspring correlations for the studies displayed in Table 2.
Under the assumption that t, = 4, the hypothesis that c,, = cy. = c,, can be rejected (2 = 9.08 — 0.64 = 8.44, p <
0.025). Accordingly, our estimates for the
model which best describes the pooled
data arem = 0.11, f = 0.45, c,, = 0.50,
C,, = 0.14 andc,, = 0.07.

We conclude, therefore, that the transmission of spatial ability is described by
the Environmental Model with ¢t, = t,.
This is compatible with polygenic transmission with a heritability of 45 per cent,
although the effects of non-sex-specific
cultural factors may mimic polygenic
transmission (Rice et al., 1978) so that
other types of data would be needed to
separate the two sources of resemblance.
From our analyses, there is no evidence to
support X-linkage, maternal effects, or

any of the sex-specific cultural mechanisms which we have described.

The conclusion that c,, # c,, # c,, indicates that the nontransmissible environmental factors relevant to the development of spatial ability are different for
males and females. This is compatible
with the argument that boys are encouraged in the home to engage in activities which enhance the development of
spatial ability, whereas girls are not.
These factors would be nontransmissible
if they depend only on the offspring’s sex
and not on the parental spatial ability
scores themselves. This could also explain
in part why a, < a,, although sex differences in cortical organization is an alternative explanation for these mean differences. Further research is needed
before the relative contributions of biological and sociocultural factors can be determined.

DISCUSSION

The models we propose are an attempt
to relax two assumptions which are implicit in the standard polygenic model for a
phenotype P when partitioned into its
genetic and environmental components as
P=G+E., The first assumption is that E
is uncorrelated between a parent and his
offspring. Cultural inheritance is one
source of such a covariance which may be
important for many behavioral or developmental phenotypes. Another possibility is that a genotype “‘seeks out”’ certain
environments so that G and E are correlated within an individual and hence would
lead to correlated E’s between parent and
child. The salient point is, however, that
such phenomena can be modeled and incorporated into genetic analyses to provide logical and consistent models for
complex traits.

The second assumption is that & is uncorrelated between individuals who are

reared contemporaneously. Such covariances may result not only from individuals
being reared in the same household, but
from E£ itself being related to covariates
such as age or SES. Such hypotheses cannot be explored without models which allow for more comprehensive types of environmental variation. These problems
are compounded by the fact that the environmental similarity between two individuals in general increases along with
their genetic similarity. We have found
path analysis and the related method of
structural equations to be a valuable tool
in addressing these problems.

Since its introduction in 1918 (Wright,
1918), path analysis has proven a useful
technique in many areas of genetics. In
contrast, its applications in the social
sciences have by and large been unfruitful
(Duncan, 1975). This has occurred in part
because even a few variables will produce
too many plausible diagrams relating
these variables if no a priori casual schema
can be deduced. In genetics, however,
only a few causal patterns are reasonable
in most situations so that only a few
models need to be considered. In the investigation of behavioral phenotypes,
models which first consider the causes of
familial resemblance, both genetic and environmental, are more likely to be fruitful
than “‘shotgun’’ approaches which use
many variables to produce ad hoc models.
The high covariances between family
members for many phenotypes indicate
that interfamilial variations can explain a
large portion of the total variances for
these phenotypes.

In analyzing the spatial ability data we
chose to test the equality of all four
parent-offspring correlations as a first step
in our analysis. Unless the pattern of correlations 1s predicted a priori, this is necessary to avoid the pitfalls of multiple comparisons. No clear pattern is apparent in
Table 2 across the individual studies. Dif

ferent measures of spatial ability are used
in these studies of different populations,
so no definitive conclusion should be
made. It is clear, however, from Table 2
that an X-linked model does not seem
likely.
