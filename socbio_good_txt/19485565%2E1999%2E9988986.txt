ABSTRACT: This study deals with models and hypotheses that attempt to explain the underlying
mechanisms determining the sex ratios at birth in human populations. Since the factors responsible are still questionable and research results are contradictory, we examine data available in
Israel on the sex ratios at birth among two different sociodemographic groups, Jews and
Moslems. Results suggest a difference between Jewish and Moslem patterns of secondary sex ratios with respect to parental age, education, and birth number. The difference may be described
as a more regular and, by existing models, a more predictable pattern of secondary sex ratio
among Moslems than among Jews. The possibility that Jewish religious laws play a role in this

difference is discussed.

The sex ratio—the number of males
per hundred females in the population—
is one of the most basic demographic
characteristics. Nowadays, when mortality is usually low, the sex ratio of the population depends heavily on its initial values, i.e., the sex ratios of newborns. The
sex ratio among newborns, known as the
birth-sex ratio or the secondary sex ratio,
usually stands at about 105 males to
every 100 females, but different population groups show varying fluctuations
over time. It is common to use the term
“proportion of males among newborn” as
a substitute for “sex ratio,” but the latter
expression is still in use (Ulizzi and
Zonta, 1995). The fluctuations of secondary sex ratios can be very small, usually only a tenth of a per cent. The social
consequences of a bias of such magnitude
is difficult to analyze and to foresee, but
in a period when chaos theory has attained such wide recognition, we cannot
neglect the possible implications of very
small changes in population sex ratios.

DETERMINANTS OF THE
SECONDARY SEX RATIO

The range of results of numerous studies on models and hypotheses that attempt to explain the underlying mechanism determining sex ratios at birth in
human populations is analyzed by James
(1987a, b) and Chachnazarian (1988).

Broadly speaking, there are two sets of
conditions for the development of sex ratios at birth: underlying biological determinants and intervening sociodemographic factors.

Biological determinants that have been
argued to affect the birth-sex ratio are
coital frequency, genetic factors, women’s
hormonal levels upon conception and
during pregnancy, and the timing of fertilization during the fertile period. High
sex ratios may result from conception either early or late in the menstrual cycle
relative to the time of ovulation (James,
1987a). Among the biological correlates,
the hand-dominance of parents has been

 

 
34 Riis

claimed to play a role, the chances of
having a son being higher when both parents are right-handed (James 19875).
Character traits of the parents have also
been proposed to determine the sex ratios, with more dominant mothers reported to have a larger proportion of sons
(Grant, 1996).

Sociodemographic factors which in

_, Some populations are associated with sta= S tistically significant differences in human

_. Sex ratios at birth are maternal and pater: nal age (higher age is associated with a
9 lower sex ratio), birth order (later-born
A children tend to be female), and social
% class (lower sex ratios among lower so20 cial classes) (James, 1987a, b; Chachnaco Zarian, 1988).
= Secondary sex ratios in human popula5 "='tions may depend on environmental facSotors such as levels of nutrition, because
4 low nutrition reportedly diminishes the
=. secondary sex ratio (Williams and Gloster,
o 1992), and war, because the sex ratio of
= newborns rises during and immediately afO ter wartime. Another additional factor in

—smoking—the sex ratio is lower among
oO © offspring of smoking women (James
2 1987b), a factor that may be classified as
© both social and biological because of the
F correlation between smoking and social
& Strata.

The purpose of this study is to analyze
the role of some of these intermediate sociodemographic factors in the formation
of secondary sex ratios in populations.
Data available from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics provide an opportunity
to examine sex ratios at birth among two
different sociodemographic groups in Israel, Jews and Moslems. It is of interest
to compare these two geographically contiguous population groups in the context

Social Biology

of a secondary sex ratio analysis because
the groups’ different forms of social, religious, and political organization may lead
to different levels of secondary sex ratio.
This effect may be the result of different
forms of sexual behavior and psychological factors conditioned by social status.
Our general hypothesis is that a difference will be found in the secondary sex
ratios of Jews and Moslems in Israel.

At the end of 1995, Israel had a Jewish
population of 4,549,500, 16.7 per cent of
whom lived in urban localities with populations of less than 10,000 or in rural areas. The country’s Moslem population
was 813,000, 45.2 per cent of whom
resided in small urban or rural localities.
Among the Jews, 21.6 per cent lived in
urban localities with populations greater
than 200,000, as against 21.7 per cent of
Moslems, most of whom lived in East
Jerusalem. The economic, political, religious, and social conditions of these two
populations are perceptibly different. In
their labor-force characteristics, these
groups differ mostly in the participation
rate of women: 49.9 per cent among Jewish women and 12.5 per cent among
Moslem women. The percentage of males
in the labor force was closer between
both groups: 61.9 per cent among Jews
and 67.4 per cent among Moslems.
Moslem households obviously had lower
incomes than Jewish ones because the
average gross monthly income of nonJewish households was NIS 3,936.3 as
against NIS 6,185.3 among Jewish households. Separate data for Moslem households were not published (Income of
Households, 1995). Average housing density (persons per room) in 1995 was 0.98
among Jews and 1.76 among Moslems.
The poorer social conditions of the
Moslem population, as expressed in such

indicators, and their lower sex ratio at
birth, coincide with the presumed correspondence between social status and secondary sex ratio. In 1994, infant mortality
rates among Moslems were twice as high
as those of Jews—-13.0 and 6.3 per thousand, respectively. There was no striking
difference in life expectancy.

Changes in fertility between 1981 and
1995 may be also associated with a
change of the secondary sex ratio. The total fertility rate of Israeli Moslems was
approximately 5.5 in the 1980’s and
dropped to 4.7 in the mid-1990’s. The total fertility rate of Jews fell from about
2.8 to 2.5 during this time. Among
Moslems, the proportion of first-born
among all births increased from 18.2 per
cent in 1980 to 23.0 per cent in 1995,
while among Jews the fraction decreased
slightly in the same period—from 31.8
per cent to 29.2 per cent. In 1994, the difference between the ages of groom and
bride upon first marriage was higher
among Moslems (3.9 years) than among
Jews (2.6 years). The age upon first marriage rose somewhat between 1980 and
1994—by about half a year—among both
populations. Thus far, fewer young unmarried Moslem adults than Jewish
adults live alone, especially among young
women (Goldscheider, 1992). Such differences may modify the secondary sex
ratio and depend on a variety of factors to
be described later.

In 1995, Jewish women submitted
15,305 applications for termination of
pregnancy and Moslem women submitted
863; the rates per 1,000 women were 14.3
and 4.7, respectively (Central Statistics
Bureau, 1998). The differences in rates
were more pronounced in younger ages
(18-19) at 18.9 and 1.7, respectively. The
number of illegal abortions in Israel was

estimated in the 1980s at about 6,000 per
year (Sabatello, 1990).

Data on the use of contraceptives in Israel are very scarce. A survey performed
in 1987-1988, in which 1,751 currently
married Jewish women aged 22-39 were
polled, showed that 68 per cent of them
used some contraceptive. Among the contraceptive users, 63 per cent used an JUD
or “the pill” as their main choice (Okun,
1997). Less is known about several specific groups in the Jewish population, especially strictly Orthodox Jews, and little
is known about Moslem women. According to findings in the mid-1970s, Israeli
Moslems were still in the early stages of
family planning and lagged behind their
Jewish counterparts in Israel (Eisenbach,
1986). Another survey was performed in
1987 (Keisar et al., 1992) but the results
concerning use of contraceptives by
Moslem women have not yet been published, except for a note stating such use
among the women in the Moslem community in Israel is increasing (Peritz,
1992). Another study, carried out in four
Moslem villages in the northern and central districts of Israel in 1988-1989, included 429 females of fertile age who had
given birth (Azaiza, 1996). Its results
show that 34 per cent of the respondents
used no contraceptive at time of the survey, 28 per cent used traditional methods,
and 37 per cent used modern devices
(“the pill,’ IUD). Comparing these findings with the survey of 1987-1988 years,
we found that the use of modern contraceptives among contraceptive users was
56 and 63 per cent among Moslem and
Jewish married couples, respectively. It
must be borne in mind that the study of
the four Moslem villages included only
women who had given birth and excluded
Bedouin women from the south, while
 

36 Riis

the study of the Jewish population included all married women including those
currently pregnant. Thus, one must be cautious when comparing the two population
groups. Furthermore, because the survey
embraced only specific subpopulations,
the rates of contraceptive use among all
married Moslem women in Israel are
probably lower that those presented in this
survey. Evidently, the gap in contraceptive
use between Jewish and Moslem women
has decreased over the past two decades.

DATA

ecember 2015

Q The birth files at the Central Bureau of
% Statistics contain individual information
e regarding approximately 100,000 births
co per year. This paper presents the analysis
43 results of about 1,500,000 births in Israel
g during the years 1980-1995. The data
may differ slightly from previously pub-2 lished official statistics because of posta publication corrections. The sex ratio, or
° more exactly the proportion of male
Z births among the total number of new© borns, was investigated for this period. To
€ achieve statistical significance in comparisons of very small differences in sex ra© tios, vast quantities of data are needed—
8 as large as 500,000 cases for each group
& (James, 1994). One doubts that such data
E will become available in the foreseeable
& future for the population groups under
consideration. Therefore, we can not determine any statistical significance for a
difference in sex ratios between the
groups; the results should be regarded as
suggestive only.

RESULTS

The dynamics of the sex ratio at birth
for Moslems and Jews throughout the period are shown in Table 1. The mean sec
Social Biology

ondary sex ratto of Jewish births in the
period reviewed was slightly higher than
that of Moslem births, at 51.39 and
51.36, respectively, but this difference is
not statistically significant. The secondary sex ratios were more stable for
Jewish births than for Moslem births
(Fig. 1). This dissimilarity may originate
in the smaller number of Moslem births,
which made their secondary sex ratios
more susceptible to random fluctuations.

The births were classified by maternal
religion, years of schooling, parental age,
and order of birth. Legitimate and illegitimate births were not considered separately. The secondary sex ratio for illegitimate births is usually lower, but since
Israel has a low percentage of such births,
this variable should not significantly
modify the overall results.

Univariate and multivariate analyses
were performed, mainly to examine and
estimate dependencies between the secondary sex ratio and available explanatory
variables. Since the dependent variable—
the sex of newborn—is dichotomous and
our goal is to estimate probabilities, the
analysis is performed by building logistic
regressions. The models evaluate the likelihood of the birth of a male child for
each of the defined categories in each religious group. The data are also presented
in two-way tables for which statistics
were computed using SAS software
(Stokes et al., 1995). The totals in Tables
2-5 and 6-8 are not equal because of different numbers of missing values in the
variables examined. Since only the results
of univariate analysis are presented in this
paper, we preferred to perform the analysis on the maximum possible number of
valid cases for each variable.

We start the analysis with the only socioeconomic variable available in the data

as a weak proxy for social and economic on the secondary sex ratio of the Israeli
status. Measured in number of years of population as a whole. The secondary sex

ratio in the Jewish population tended to
rise commensurate with maternal education, and the effect was even stronger
among the Moslems. Paternal education
had a similar effect. It seems that the effect of level of education becomes clear
only when a large difference in educational level exists within the population
group. Such a difference indeed exists in
wthe case of the Moslem population, which

Awho found that the decline of secondary
sex ratio with birth order was very small
in large human populations. The secondary sex ratio of first-born was found
to be higher among Moslems (51.52)
than among Jews (51.39). This finding is
compatible with hypotheses about declining coital rates during couples’ conjugal
life and the effect of coital rates on secondary sex ratios. A considerable proportion of Jewish young couples cohabit for
some time before marriage, while this be

havior is_ still exceptional among
Moslems. These different premarital

arrangements may affect the sex of the
first child.

In this study, as in many others, the
secondary sex ratio exhibited a complicated correspondence to maternal age and
a more-or-less apparent decline with paternal age. The sex ratio declines with paternal age for both Jews and Moslems.
The study did not detect a descending
trend in the sex ratio with maternal age
among Jews. The curve in this variable
resembles that found in England and
Wales (James and Rostron, 1985). A
steady and monodirectional decline in sex
ratio with mother’s age was discerned
among the Moslems. The regression coefficients were positive for the Jews and
negative for the Moslems. The results of
the aforementioned study by James and
Rostron show that the secondary sex ratio
declined regularly with maternal age until
1959 and that afterwards, compared with
the previous years, the sex ratio declined
among women aged 20-24 and increased
for mothers aged 30-34. The authors
cited among possible causes the use of
oral contraceptives, artificial insemination, racial heterogeneity, and rising
promiscuity. Similar mechanisms may
explain the difference in the secondary
sex ratio patterns of Jews and Moslems in
Israel.

It is also useful to examine the effect
of the difference between maternal and
paternal age (age of father less age of
mother) on the sex ratio. Such an influence has been reported (Manning et al.,
1997). In our data, the secondary sex ratio declines slightly as the age difference
rises between husband and wife in the
Jewish population and, to a lesser degree,
in the Moslem population.

Finally, a multivariate analysis of available variables was performed to evaluate
the cumulative importance of the explanatory variables. A multivariate logistic regression was built for sex of offspring as
against maternal age, years of schooling,
paternal age, and birth order. This method

allows us to estimate the fraction of the
variance that each factor explains. Separate analyses were conducted for Jews and
Moslems. Two models were built for each
group: one including years of schooling in
addition to maternal and paternal age and
birth order; the other not including the

first-mentioned variable. The regression
equations included only major effects.

The model that included years of
schooling was not statistically significant,
but the models excluding this variable
were found significant for both religious
groups, testing the hypothesis that the effects of the models are jointly equal to
zero. As for the univariate regression, the

coefficient for maternal age was positive
for Jewish mothers and negative for
Moslems. Negative coefficients were obtained for both religious groups with respect to paternal age and birth order in
marriage. Thus, the effects appear to be
the same in the presence of other factors.
Based on the results attained, we
found several differences between Jewish

and Moslem patterns of secondary sex ratios. The difference may be described in
sum as more regular behavior of the secondary sex ratio among Moslems than
among Jews, that is, Moslems’ behavior
conforms more strongly than Jews’ behavior to that predicted by the existing
models.
We looked for other possible factors
ip, that may contribute to the observed differ= ence in the patterns of Jewish and Moslem
i S secondary sex ratios. One such factor
S might be the presence of a religiously ob® servant (Orthodox) group within the JewA ish population of Israel. A considerable
%© part of Jewish births of high parity may be
co attributed to this population subgroup,
co thereby explaining the higher sex ratio for
= higher birth numbers among Jews than
Sg among Moslems. This factor, which we
&0 labeled as religious, deserves special ref5 erence due to the special effect of Jewish
religious laws on the sexual behavior of
Orthodox married couples.

THE RELIGIOUS FACTOR

Jewish religious laws require abstention from intercourse during menstruation
© and for a period of seven days after its
© end. This means that, given the usual
: 28-30 day cycle, intercourse may not reZ sume before the thirteenth to the fifteenth
day in the cycle, or 2-4 days before ovulation. The James theory predicts that the
sex of offspring is affected by the day in
the fertile cycle on which the insemination responsible for conception occurs.

Harlap (1979, cited by Guttentag and
Secord (1983), analyzed data on 3,658
births among Jewish women who described themselves as adhering to Jewish
law. The sex ratio among these births declined from 114 among those reportedly

load

Secondary Sex Ratio 41

caused by insemination 1-2 days before
ovulation to a low of 97 for births resulting from insemination occurring on ovulation day. The sex ratio then rose again
to 100 on the day following ovulation and
to 153 the next day. Overall, the sex ratio
was 112. The shortcomings of Harlap’s
research were criticized in a more recent
study by Martin (1995). Martin surmises
that the reported abstinence through
seven “clean” days after menstruation
had not been observed. This hypothesis
may surely be true for some of the interviewed women. Therefore, information
regarding religious communities as evidence of the influence of religious rules
on the birth-sex ratio must be treated with
some skepticism.

However, since the Jewish religious
rules cause and even prescribe high rates
of coitus during the two or so days before
ovulation, when the probability of conceiving male offspring is higher, they
should increase the secondary sex ratio.
Strictly speaking, the Jewish religious
codes of sexual conduct may influence the
primary sex ratio, that at the time of conception. The results of genetic analysis of
sex in spontaneous abortions indicate that
the primary sex ratio and the secondary
sex ratio may be quite comparable
(Brewis, 1993). Hence, the observance of
Jewish religious laws may increase the
probability of birth of male offspring, but
the expected change would be minor. This
supposition is compatible with James’s
conclusion concerning a possible but very
marginal effect of coital rates on the secondary sex ratio (James, 1994). The problem may be more complicated if the correspondence between coital frequency and
secondary sex ratio is nonlinear, 1e., increasing in one domain of coital frequencies and decreasing in another.

Demographers (e.g., Dobroszycki, 1981)
have traditionally denied the possibility
of biased sex ratios at birth among Orthodox Jews on the basis of unsatisfactory
quality of data stemming from underregistration of births of Jewish girls. They
cite statistical data from nineteenthcentury Russia, where the secondary sex
ratio was reported as high as 137, and

i, Other historical data sources of similar
S quality, and conclude that such a bias
+ Seems impossible. However, in the first
Russian Empire census in 1897, we
© found a sex ratio of about 105 for Jewish
G children under the age of one, and a ratio
& of about 101 for the population at large at
2 the same age. While this finding may reco sult from different infant-mortality rates,
= it may also reflect the initial levels of the
's'different groups’ secondary sex ratio. The
SS ‘
relatively high sex ratio among Orthodox
.2 Jews today is still considered an admissi= ble and given fact by the leading re¢ searchers in the field (e.g., James, 1987a).
‘Z The possibility that Orthodox Jews have
D an unusually high secondary sex ratio has

— (1983), but without a definite conclusion
s reached. We attempted to examine this
8 possibility by applying data available in
S Israel.
We searched for evidence to examine
A our hypothesis within the data at our disposal. Israeli statistics contain no data on
religiosity at the level of individual
records. Therefore, we examined secondary sex ratios in localities characterized by a predominantly Orthodox population. We selected three such groups: (1)
The secondary sex ratio during 19801995 was 52.11 in religious kibbutzim
versus 51.63 in other (secular) kibbutzim.
(2) Nine localities with a high proportion
of voters for the ultra-Orthodox parties in

ownl

Social Biology

the 1996 elections showed an overall secondary sex ratio of 51.56. (3) Settlements
defined as religious in Judea, Samaria,
and Gaza had a sex ratio of 51.30. For the
same period, three small strictly Orthodox localities—-Emanuel, Upper Betar,
and Kfar Chabad, showed rates of 51.80,
52.31, and 50.14, respectively. Since variances of such magnitudes occur in many
Israeli localities, this finding in itself cannot lead us to any definite conclusion
about the existence of a difference in the
sex ratios at birth of Orthodox and nonOrthodox Jewish communities. Due to
the small size of the groups under consideration, we could not control for socioeconomic status, the age-sex structure of
the population groups, and other intervening factors that may affect the secondary sex ratios in the opposite direction
of the religious rules. We did, however,
examine the sex ratio patterns by maternal and paternal age and by birth number.
The results are shown in Tables 6-8.
Comparing the foregoing results with
those for the Jewish population at large
and with the Moslems, we find a much
higher sex ratio in high birth numbers and
among older parents in the Orthodox
group. For high birth numbers, there was
a slight increase in the sex ratio among
Moslems as well. Figure 2 presents secondary sex ratio data by birth number for
the Jewish and Moslem populations and
for the three Orthodox subpopulations.
This finding may be attributed to the influence of the Jewish religious laws. As
stated, these rules may increase coital rates
during the most fertile days of the cycle
and thereby raise the probability of the
birth of a male child to couples in older
age groups. The sex ratio at birth does not
increase at younger ages, possibly because
religious observance is weaker among the

younger cohorts, especially with respect to
regulations governing marital sexual relations (cf. Martin, 1995).

Another complication is that the role
of coital timing and frequency may be
less important than that of other factors,
say, psychological. James (1995) has suggested that parental hormone levels
prompted by perceived adult sex ratios affect the level of sex ratios in the successor

generation, thus providing the basis for a
negative feedback process that stabilizes
the sex ratio. Alongside this mechanism,
we may presume the existence of a stabilizing mechanism that functions as a reaction to the perceived sex ratio of children
in the population. In the case of the Orthodox Jewish community, this perception
may produce psychological tension because the Biblical commandment to be

fruitful and to multiply (Genesis 9:7) implies the duty to have a daughter as well
as a son. This tension may balance the
secondary sex ratio in low parities, but
when the sexes of a married couple’s offspring attain the desired composition, the
tension weakens and other factors, such
as coital frequency, become more impor
 

 

tant, thus boosting the sex ratio in high
birth numbers.

It is possible that psychological factors
influence more than the hormonal level.
Supposing even that the secondary sex ratio
is a completely random process, i.e., one
that cannot be influenced directly by any of
the aforementioned sociodemographic and
 

Vol. 46, No. 1-2

cultural factors, the ratios still can be to
some degree altered merely by parental intentions. Data from various man-machine
experiments indicate that human operators can bias random output distributions
in accordance to their pre-stated intentions (Jahn, 1989). There is no reason to
believe that parental intentions cannot influence processes at work within their
own organisms. This proposition regarding the impact of parental intentions conforms well to results showing that more
dominant mothers have more sons among
their progeny, since it seems very plausible that the preferred sex of offspring in
%& modern society still remains the male.
& Parental intentions, of course, are prod° ucts of the sociocultural environment and,
< in turn, influence this environment. The
role of parental intentions deserves more
thorough examination but requires data
sources not currently available.

CONCLUSIONS

Different secondary sex ratio patterns
among Jews and Moslems in Israel may
be responsible for the slightly higher sex
ratio at birth observed among the Jewish
population. The explanation may be that
the higher fertility of Moslem women,
with a large number of high-order births
among older women, leads to a lower
probability, relative to that of Jewish
women, of giving birth to a boy. This situ

ation would result in a lower total secondary sex ratio among Moslems than
among Jews. The different patterns may
also reflect the difference between population groups, such as the Jewish and the
Moslem communities, that make greater
and lesser use of contraceptives and induced abortions. Another possible factor
is the religious one. Although the strict
observance of religious rules cannot result
in a noteworthy increase in the secondary
sex ratio, it may contribute to a difference
between Jewish and Moslem parental agepatterns related to the secondary sex ratio.

Most of the unexplained variance in
secondary sex ratios may be the result of
factors that can not be sufficiently approximated by the sociodemographic and
cultural variables that we consider here.
The secondary sex ratio differences may
be traceable to much more indirect factors than the existing statistics can reveal.
