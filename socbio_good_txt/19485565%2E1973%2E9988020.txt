Fertility Patterns Within the Mexican
American Population

Peter Uhlenberg

Department of Sociology
University of North Carolina
Chapel Hill, North Carolina

No racial or ethnic group distinguished
by the United States census has a fertility
level as high as Mexican-Americans,! when
standardized fer rural-urban residence. The
comparison of various groups in Table 1
indicates the distinctiveness of MexicanAmericans’ reproductive behavior, particularly in urban areas. At all ages in both
urban and nonurban areas, American Indian women, who often are thought to have
the highest fertility rates of any group,
have borne fewer children per ever-married
woman than Mexican-Americans.? Among
women in urban areas at the end of their
childbearing years (those aged 35 to 49),
the average number of children for MexicanAmericans is over 50% larger than for
Negroes and about 70% greater than for
native whites. This strikingly high fertility
of Mexican-Americans relative to the dominant pattern in the United States has

1Following the practice of the United States
census bureau, the Mexican-American population
is represented by the Spanish-surname population
living in the five Southwestern states.

2The slightly higher average number of children for the total American Indian population
compared to the total Mexican-American population results from the gross differences in proportion rural. Only 23% of American Indians,
compared to 80% of Mexican-Americans, lived in
urban areas in 1960, and both groups had higher
fertility rates in rural than urban areas.

received almost no sociological or demographic analysis (brief discussions are given
in Browning and McLemore, 1964, p. 23-28
and in Grebler, Moore and Guzman, 1970,
p. 126-128).

Although previously neglected by fertility studies, the Mexican-American population provides an exceptionally valuable case
for observing how various factors influence
family size. The foreign-born come from a
developing country characterized by a very
high rate of reproduction (crude birth rate
above 40). They enter a modern, urban,
industrial nation with moderately low levels
of fertility (crude birth rate under 20).
How they are their descendants adjust
their fertility to this new environment reveals much about social determinants of
reproduction. Similarly, variations within
the population between subgroups with
differing social and economic characteristics
provide insight into the process of fertility
reduction. An examination of the reproductive behavior of the foreign-born provides
a starting place for this study of differential fertility patterns within the MexicanAmerican population.

of foreign-born persons living in the United
States comes from the 1910 census (see
Table 2). In that year Mexican-born women
with completed fertility averaged 6.5 children each, which was substantially above
the 4.3 average of native-born white women.
Compared to other immigrants, however,
Mexican women were not exceptional. On
the other hand, by 1960 Mexicans occupied a unique position compared to all
foreign-born women, by having more than
twice the average number of children per
ever-married woman. Despite a reduction

classified according to the census definition of urban and rural.

Mexican women with completed childbearing, the second most fertile group in 1960
was Italian women, who averaged only 2.6
children each.

The size of completed families for Mexican-born women in 1960 was similar to
that of native-born white women in the
United States in 1910, which suggests that
this group is lagging fifty years behind the
dominant society in fertility behavior. Women who completed their childbearing by
1910, however, were bearing their children
under conditions of much higher infant
mortality than now exist. Therefore, with

respect to effective reproduction, Mexicanborn women lag even further behind other
white women. The ratio of children under
5 years old to women aged 20 to 44 (standardized for age distribution of women) indicates that the reproductive level achieved
by Mexican immigrants in 1960 was characteristic of all white women in the United
States in 1860. Thus, the average family
size of first generation Mexican-Americans
is equal to that of other American families
during the early stages of the Industrial
Revolution.

A valuable background for understanding
the reproductive behavior of Mexicans in
the United States lies in a clear picture of
the reproductive behavior of Mexicans in
Mexico. Since most immigrants spend their
childhoods in their country of origin, they
are conditioned by many of the forces determining that country’s level of fertility
(Spearman rank correlation between crude
birth rates in country of origin and fertility
level in the United States for the populations in Table 2 is 0.720, significant at

Social Biology

0.01). In Mexico we find that despite a
rapid decline in mortality (since 1920 the
death rate has been reduced by more than
half), and considerable economic growth
and rapid urbanization, the birth rate has
shown no sign of decreasing. In fact, when
standardized for the age and sex distribution of the population, fertility has actually
been increasing (Arriaga, 1970). Moreover,
recent investigators of Mexican fertility
have concluded that urban fertility has increased and is no longer substantially lower
than rural fertility (Robinson and Robinson, 1960; Zarate, 1967).

To be sure, Mexican immigrants have
not been exactly replicating the reproductive levels of Mexicans in Mexico. The 1960
census of Mexico reported there were an
average of 4.9 live births per woman aged
40 to 49, and 6.3 births per mother in this
age range. Among Mexican-born women in
the United States in 1960 the comparable
number of births per woman was 4.3 and
per mother was 5.2. Thus, women who migrated to the United States averaged about
one less child per woman than those who
remained in Mexico. On the other hand, the
fertility of Mexican immigrants was much
closer to the pattern existing in Mexico
than to that in the United States, as is
revealed by the fact that they had, on the
average, almost twice the number of children of similar age native white women.
One indication of how much MexicanAmerican fertility varies from what is considered ideal in the United States is shown
by the number of women who have two to
four children. The Growth of American
Families Study found that about 90% of
the American women interviewed considered between two and four children ideal
for the average family. Over 60% of evermarried Mexican-born women aged 40 to
49 do not fall within this range. While 22%
of first generation Mexican-American women had seven or more children, only 2.4%

of other white women in the Southwest had
that many.

Clearly, the fertility of Mexicans—
whether in developing and urbanizing Mexico, or in developed and urbanized North
America—does not readily respond to influences that we customarily regard as antinatalist. But what of second and third
generation Mexican-Americans? Have they
made the transition from patterns characteristic of Mexico to those of the United
States?

complex, industrial economic system. The
demographic literature repeatedly argues
that each of these variables has a depressing effect upon fertility. However, there are
other variables that might be operating to
vitiate the force of these supposedly antinatalist factors. The continued concentration of second and third generation Mexican-Americans in ethnic enclaves (Grebler,
Moore, and Guzman, 1970, p. 271-289)
may encourage the preservation of earlier
social patterns, their relatively disadvantaged socioeconomic position may weaken
the impact of economic forces, and their
greater- emphasis on familism (Burma,
1954, p. 33-84; Murillo, 1971) may positively encourage large families.

Actual generational trends in MexicanAmerican fertility are presented in Table 3,

ican-Americans have produced more children per woman than the immigrant generation. Compared to fertility levels of
populations with almost unchecked procreation, it is obvious that most MexicanAmericans do limit their family size. But
it is equally apparent that as of 1960, even
third generation Mexican-Americans had
not adopted the small family size pattern
characteristic of the dominant society. The
lack of differentiation between generations
in fertility performance does not, of course,
imply that temporal changes are not occurring, nor that other important differences
within the population do not exist. It simply
indicates that length of exposure to American society has little relationship to the
fertility behavior of Mexican-Americans.
Data from the 1970 census will permit
a@ more adequate assessment of whether
more recent cohorts of Mexican-Americans
are beginning to significantly alter their
fertility behavior, since the information in
Table 3 is inconclusive. In 1960, the group
of Mexican-American women aged 25 to 34
was well ahead of the comparable group of
other white women in rate of childbearing,
and it is probable that the differential in

a much greater extent than other whites,
Mexican-American women continue to bear
children during the later stage of their
fecund period of life. When a population
begins to reduce its fertility, however, it is
generally reflected first in a reduction of
age-specific birth rates at the older ages.
Therefore, it is possible that changes are
occurring within the Mexican-American
population, and that despite their initially
rapid pace of reproduction, the younger
cohorts may not replicate the pattern of
the older ones.

SOCIOECONOMIC DIFFERENTIALS
IN FERTILITY

An examination of differential fertility
by educational attainment within the Mexican-American population produces the interesting results presented in Table 5. Mexican-American women who have completed
four years of high school have almost exactly the same average number of children
as do similarly educated other whites; but
among the less educated, Mexican-American women have much higher fertility
rates. Mexican-American women aged 35
to 54 who have completed high school have

an average of 2.7 children per mother, compared to 2.6 children for comparably educated other white women. In contrast, similar age Mexican-American mothers with
less than eight years of schooling average
over six children per woman, while poorly
educated other white women average 3.8.
The difference in number of children produced by high school graduates and those
with less than eight years of schooling is
three times larger for Mexican-American
women than for other white women. The

same pattern, though not quite as accentuated, is seen when education of husband is
used instead of education of wife. Thus, it
is the poorly educated segment of the minority that is responsible for the exceptionally high fertility of this group. The fact
that a very small per cent of all MexicanAmericans have completed four years of
high school means that the low fertility of
the better educated has little influence upon
the minority’s overall rate.

occupation of the husband as an indicator
of social class results in similar conclusions.
Middle-class Mexican-Americans have families quite similar in size to other middleclass whites, while those with lower socioeconomic characteristics have much larger
families than other whites in similar positions. The largest fertility differential by
occupation for the total white population
is one child per woman more among farm
workers than among white collar workers,
but for Mexican-Americans the difference
between these two groups is 3.8 children
per woman.

To better determine the relative social
position of a woman, it is helpful to see
how she rates on several variables simultaneously. Using this approach, it is possible to distinguish low fertility and high
fertility syndromes among Mexican-American women. A woman is considered to have
a low fertility syndrome if both she and
her husband have a high school education
and the husband earns at least $5,000 per
year. The 67 Mexican-American women
aged 35 to 54 with these characteristics
who were included in the 1 in 1,000 sample from the 1960 census averaged only 2.0
children per woman, and only four (6%)
had as many as five children. The high fertility syndrome applies to a woman if both
she and her husband have attended Jess
than eight years of school and the husband
earns less than $3,000 per year. MexicanAmerican women in this category averaged
6.1 children per woman, and over twothirds had five or more children. Contrasting these two groups of women reveals
clearly how extreme variations in family
size are between different segments of the
Mexican-American population.

DISCUSSION

Residence in the United States has reduced the fertility of Mexican-Americans
to levels somewhat Jower than those exist
Social Biology

ing in Mexico, but the minority’s continued
large families by American standards and
their lack of generational differences indicate that mere presence in a modern, urban
milieu has only a limited impact upon
reproductive behavior. Rather, it appears
that family size is significantly reduced
only among that segment of MexicanAmericans that has achieved middle-class
status, a status which tends to reflect
greater actual involvement in the dominant
social structure. These fertility patterns
within the Mexican-American population
lend themselves to two opposing interpretations, and the conflict cannot be fully
resolved without obtaining additional information.

One interpretation of the observed fertility patterns would follow the position found
in family-planning literature, which emphasizes the importance of the instrumental
factors in determining fertility behavior
(for example, see Jaffe and Guttmacher,
1968). This position argues that the huge
social class variations seen above indicate
that lack of accessibility to contraceptives
is primarily responsible for the group’s high
fertility. It suggests that the poorly educated and economically disadvantaged do
not have access to effective contraceptives
through private medicine and that public
family-planning facilities are not readily
available. Furthermore, lack of knowledge
about the reproductive process and Catholic
doctrine are seen as additional barriers to
successful family planning by disadvantaged Mexican-Americans.

Until information becomes available on
family size desires among Mexican-Americans, and on the extent to which they
either lack knowledge of or access to contraceptives, an adequate assessment of this
position is not possible. It would be necessary to show not only that poorly educated
Mexican-Americans are less able than the
better educated to plan their families, but

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

Vol. 20, No. 1

also that they are, for some reason, less able
than comparably educated other whites.
Available information on attitudes toward
contraception indicates that opposition to
their use is not very substantial. A survey
of Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles®
found that 62% of the respondents felt it
was always or usually right for married
couples to practice birth control, while only
15% felt it was always wrong.

The opposing interpretation of MexicanAmerican fertility would follow from the
literature which challenges some basic assumptions of the family-planning movement, and which examines how reproductive motivation is structured in society (see
Blake, 1965). This approach would emphasize that among Mexican-Americans who
are largely assimilated into the dominant
society (primarily the middle-class), the
same forces are operating as for other
whites, and their fertility is very similar.
Among the less assimilated, however, one
can find evidence of strong social support
from the minority for large families, and
this segment has very high fertility. Most
important in encouraging and rewarding
reproduction are the socially preferred family system and sex roles. As with the other
position, more data are required to test
this explanation, but some information on
the Mexican-American family is suggestive
of how strong reproductive motivation may
arise.*

A variety of community studies have

San Antonio (603 interviews), see Grebler, Moore,
and Guzman, 1970, p. 631-665.

4 Studies of the family in Mexico also provide
valuable evidence of how Mexican social structure
encourages large families. Kahl (1967) shows that
Mexican males have much larger family size
ideals than comparable Brazilian males, and he
relates this to distinctive aspects of Mexican family structure. A discussion of marriage and family
roles by McGinn (1966) shows rather clearly how
motivation for reproduction is encouraged by the
role of females, which makes childbearing the only
means of gaining status.

reported that the family (including the
extended family) is the most important
element in lower-class Mexican-American
society. Sex roles are also clearly specified,
with no socially approved alternative for
females other than wife and mother with
almost exclusive interest focused upon the
family (see Burma, 1954; Murillo, 1971).
One might expect this familistic emphasis
to change with urbanization, and no doubt
it is weakened. Nevertheless, when Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles and San
Antonio were asked whether they agreed
or disagreed that “Mexican-Americans tend
to have stronger family ties than most other
Americans,” two-thirds expressed agreement. Based upon additional information
from these surveys, Joan Moore (1970,
p. 117) gives this summary of findings regarding the roles of females in metropolitan
areas:

Women still find their major role and valida
tion in their families, as wives and espe
cially as mothers. Higher education and
careers are still alien to many Mexican
American woman. Even a working wife is

considered an embarrassment by most

Mexican-American men.

Indeed, the very low educational achievement of Mexican-American females severely
limits their options for alternative roles. In
1960, only 19% of all Mexican-American
adult females were high school graduates,
and only slightly more than 1% were college graduates. Among married MexicanAmerican females, only 23% were employed outside the home, compared to
36% of other white females.5 Moreover,
while two-thirds of the employed otherwhite women had white-collar jobs, which
permit greater social interaction and are
presumably more rewarding than manual

5 As anticipated, Mexican-American females who
are employed have fewer children than those who
are not employed. Among women with their
spouse present who were aged 35 to 54, those who
were employed averaged 1.9 fewer children per
women than those not employed.

jobs, only one-third of the employed Mexican-Americans had such jobs. Finally,
there is little social involvement outside the
family context. Seventy per cent of the
respondents in Los Angeles and over 80%
in San Antonio indicated that they do not
belong to any organization that meets more
or Jess regularly. Not only do they not
attend social meetings, but they also do
not have frequent interaction with neighbors. Five per cent in San Antonio and
18% in Los Angeles visit frequently with
neighbors, while 80% in San Antonio stated
that they visited rarely or never. An example of how completely Mexican-American women seem to have accepted the
primacy of their role as mothers and rejected alternative roles is revealed by their
responses to a question asking if they
agreed or disagreed that, “Having children
is the most important thing that can be
done by a married woman.” Over 85% of
the respondents agreed with this statement
concerning the preferred role for women.
Most likely, additional research will show
that Mexican-American fertility patterns
are best understood by combining the two
interpretations discussed here. For the entire United States population, Bumpass and
Westoff (1970) have shown that pregnancies among less educated and high parity
women are more often unwanted than pregnancies among better educated and low
parity woman. It would therefore be surprising if much of the higher fertility of
Mexican-Americans is not a result of failures in family planning. At the same time,
the much higher fertility of Mexican-American women than other whites in lower socioeconomic groups requires that special
attention be focused upon the minority’s
unique social structure. The above discussion of family structure and sex roles as
factors in the group’s high rate of reproduction is only suggestive, but it is prom

ising enough to encourage further research
along these lines.

SUMMARY

Mexican-Americans present an interesting example of a group that even after
three generations in the United States have
reproductive levels more characteristic of
nonindustrial than industrial populations.
Further examination, however, reveals extreme variations within the Mexican-American population, with the middle class
having the same size families as other
whites. These findings suggest that it is
not presence in, but rather involvement in
an urban, industrial society which has
greatest effect in forcing modification in
reproductive behavior. A serious gap in our
knowledge of Mexican-American fertility
results from the absence of any information
on desired family size. Without these data
we cannot satisfactorily answer the question of how much of the high fertility of
the lower-class results from their inability
to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and how
much it results from their desire for large
families.

Future trends in Mexican-American fertility are likely to be most dependent upon
how rapidly the group achieves upward
social mobility and greater involvement in
American society, although efforts of family-planning organizations may also have
some effect. Thus far, the minority has
been composed predominately of poorly educated and economically disadvantaged individuals, and these individuals have produced very large families. Increasingly,
however, Mexican-Americans are,expressing
discontent with their economic plight, and
their efforts to change existing conditions
may indirectly influence reproductive behavior. As more individuals perceive children as an expense and an impediment to
greater economic achievement, and as

efforts at contraceptive dissemination
among the poor increase, we can expect
more Mexican-Americans to respond by
reducing the sizes of their families.
