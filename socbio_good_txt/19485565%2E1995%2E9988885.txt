ABSTRACT: This study examined the effect of maternal age on birth outcomes among young
adolescents, ages 10 through 15. All records representing single births of primipara, Black or
White adolescents, were selected for analysis from the 1983-1986 National Center for Health
Statistics’ Public Use Linked Live Birth-Infant Death Data File (n = 127,668). Logistic regression analyses controlled for effects of maternal race, marital status, prenatal care, gravidity,
education, and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan residency. Univariate analyses indicated that the
youngest adolescents were at greatest risk for negative birth outcomes including very preterm
and preterm delivery, low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), and neonatal mortality.
Logistic analyses showed similar results, with the exception that differences in SGA were
insignificant. This study indicates the importance of examining age-specific birth outcomes
among a population that has traditionally been studied in aggregate and underscores the need
for increased prevention efforts.

1983); and infant mortality (Alexander
et al., 1987). In contrast, others have
found adolescent mothers to be at no
greater risk for these same birth outcomes (Babson and Clarke, 1983;
Brown et al., 1991; Creatsas et al.,
1991; Horon et al., 1983; McCormick
et al., 1984; Elster, 1984). Interpretation of the data from some of these
studies is further limited since many do

this study is to determine, by using information available from vital records,
whether or not maternal age among
young adolescents has an independent
effect on birth outcomes, including
age-specific birth rates, gestational
age, birth weight, birth weight for gestational age, and neonatal, postneonatal, and infant mortality. The independent effect of age on each of these
outcome measures is assessed while

controlling for the effects of maternal
race, marital status, prenatal care,
gravidity, maternal educational attainment, and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan residency. The study hypothesizes
that a pattern of increasingly poorer
birth outcomes will emerge among the
infants of this cohort of mothers, as
maternal age decreases, thereby suggesting a relationship between maternal age and birth outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study uses data from the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS, 1991) Linked Birth—Infant
Death Data Set, for the 1983 through
1986 birth cohort. All records representing single births of young adolescent mothers who were US residents,
Black or White, and primiparas were
chosen for analysis. Selected cases
totaled 127,668 live births and 2,470
infant deaths. The study population
was limited to mothers 10 through 15
years of age to identify significant differences in birth outcomes among
these youngest mothers. Records of
Black (n=61,320) and White (n=
66,348) mothers were used, as preliminary birth frequencies among women
of all other races were insufficient to
calculate stable rates. Only primipara
births were selected, since differences
in birth weight (Selvin and Janerich,
1971; Sweeney, 1989), birth weight for
gestational age (Elster, 1984), and infant mortality (Sweeney, 1989) have
been found between adolescent primipara and multipara births. In addition,
only single births were studied to control for any possible differences inherent in multiple births. Furthermore, 35

cases were excluded due to having
grossly inconsistent age and years of
completed education data, i.e., having
an education level well above what
would be expected for their age. A
closer examination of these cases suggested that their reported age was in
error.

Few births occurred among young
adolescents 10-11 years of age (n=
108). Therefore, births to these age
groups were combined with those occurring to 12-year-old mothers. Marital status at the time the mother gave
birth was either married or not married. Prenatal care was categorized
according to a modification of the
Kessner Index, which incorporates the
trimester prenatal care began, the
number of prenatal care visits, and gestational age (Alexander and Cornely,
1982; Kessner et al., 1973). Gravidity
was either primigravida (0 previous
pregnancies) or multigravida (greater
than or equal to 1 previous pregnancy).
Educational attainment was based on
both the number of years of education
and the age of the mother. If age was
greater than or equal to 2 years older
than would be expected for the number
of school years completed, education
status was defined as low. If age was
within a plus or minus one year range
of what would be expected for the
number of school years completed, education status was average. And if age
was 2-4 years below what would be
expected for the number of school
years completed, education status was
high. Residency was either metropolitan (population greater than or equal
to 250,000) or nonmetropolitan (less
than 250,000). For the purposes of
logistic regression analyses, the refer
 

Social Biology

ence group consisted of mothers 15
years of age who were White, were
married, had adequate prenatal care,
had one or more previous pregnancies,
had average educational attainment,
and were nonmetropolitan residents.
The following definitions were used
in evaluating birth outcome variables.
Age-specific birth rates were calculated using 1983 through 1986 census
data (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1987). Gestational age was measured
as either very preterm (less than or
equal to 32 weeks of gestation), moderately preterm (33-36 weeks), preterm (less than or equal to 36 weeks),
term (37-41 weeks), or post-term
(greater than or equal to 42 weeks).
Birth weight was reported as very low
(less than or equal to 1499 grams),
moderately low (1500-2499 grams),
low (less than or equal to 2499 prams),
average (2500-4249 grams), or heavy
(greater than or equal to 4250 grams).
Infant weight for gestational age was
reported as either small, average, or
large, based on the criteria of Brenner
(Brenner et al., 1976). Infants below
the 10th percentile of birth weight for
gestational age were small for gestational age (SGA); infants between the
10th and 90th percentile of birth weight
for gestation age were average for gestational age (AGA); and infants above
the 90th percentile of birth weight
for gestational age were large for gestational age (LGA) (Brenner et al.,
1976). Three measures of mortality
were used. Neonatal mortality rates included infant deaths occurring within
the first 27 days of life. Postneonatal
mortality rates included deaths from 28
days through 11 months of life. And infant mortality rates included deaths

Vol. 42, No. 1-2

within the first year of life. All rates
were calculated per 1,000 age-specific
live births.

Descriptive statistics were used to
determine the frequencies of births and
deaths. Chi-square analyses were used
to determine if an association existed
between maternal age and the following outcome measures: gestational
age, birth weight, birth weight for gestational age, and mortality rates. Logistic regression was used to determine
the independent effect of maternal age
on birth outcome, controlling for the
effects of maternal race, marital status,
prenatal care, gravidity, maternal educational attainment, and residency.

RESULTS
MATERNAL CHARACTERISTICS

Birth rates and sociodemographic
characteristics differed significantly
across age groups (Table 1). As maternal age increased, age-specific birth
rates increased. A higher proportion of
mothers 10 through 14 years of age
were Black, while more than half of
those 15 years of age were White. The
oldest adolescents (15 years of age)
were less likely than the other age
groups to be not married and have inadequate prenatal care. This group was
more likely to have low educational attainment, nonmetropolitan residency,
one or more previous pregnancies, and
have their child fathered by an adult.
Findings concerning prenatal care, education, and father’s age should be
viewed cautiously, since greater than
10 per cent of the data were missing
among the age cohorts.

BIRTH OUTCOMES

Birth outcomes differed  significantly by maternal age (Table 2). The
proportion of very preterm and moderately preterm deliveries decreased
significantly as maternal age increased,
although the proportion missing a gestational age value also decreased with
maternal age. Similarly, as maternal
age increased, the proportion of births
that were very low and moderately low
birth weight decreased, while the percentage of births that were normal
birth weight increased. Compared to
the older age groups, births to adolescents 10-12 years of age were more
likely to be SGA, and the proportion
of SGA births decreased as maternal
age increased. As maternal age increased, neonatal and infant mortality
decreased. Although this same trend
appeared for postneonatal mortality,
the difference was not significant.

INDEPENDENT EFFECTS OF MATERNAL
AGE ON BIRTH OUTCOMES

Based on the results of logistic regression analyses, a progressively increased risk of very preterm and preterm birth was observed for younger
age groups when compared to the 15year-old group (Table 3). Other maternal factors that were independently
and significantly associated with very
preterm and preterm delivery included
Black maternal race, being not married, inadequate and intermediate prenatal care, and metropolitan residency. In addition, low educational
attainment was a risk factor for preterm delivery. Primigravidity was a
protective factor against very preterm
delivery.

The risk of delivering a very low or

and inadequate prenatal care were associated with very low and low birth
weight. Intermediate prenatal care and
low educational attainment were addi

attainment were risk factors. Being not
married was protective of postneonatal
mortality.

Healthy People 2000 lays out objectives, or “national opportunities” relating to maternal and infant health
(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1991). Very young adolescents are at considerably greater risk
for late initiation of prenatal care and
several poor birth outcomes compared
to both national target figures and
baseline data for all women of reproductive age (Table 5).

DISCUSSION

For very young women who give
birth in the United States, this study
provides additional evidence for a link
between maternal age and birth outcomes. For young mothers between
the ages of 10 and 15, clear yearly incremental trends were demonstrated
that showed increases in the extent of
very preterm and preterm birth, very
low and low birth weight, and neonatal
mortality as maternal age decreased.
Further, the data suggests that the
most marked differentiation in outcomes occurs between the ages of 13
and 14 years. Despite possible differences in physical, psychosocial, and
cognitive development between adolescents who are 10 and those who are
15 years of age, previous studies examining birth outcomes have typically categorized these young adolescents into
a single age group. This study revealed
disparities in risk, which until now
have been masked in aggregate data.

Both preterm delivery and intrauterine growth retardation are precursors to low birth weight. While logistic
regression analyses showed significant

 

 

Social Biology

differences in preterm delivery among
young adolescents, no significant differences were found in birth weight
for gestational age (SGA). It appears,
therefore, that the increased risk of
very low and low birth weight found in
this study among the youngest adolescents can be largely attributed to preterm delivery. These data, however,
should be viewed cautiously due to the
high proportion of missing data on gestational age measures, especially in
the younger age groups. In addition,
the accuracy of the data that is reported may be problematic. Because
they have been found to experience
more vaginal bleeding in their first trimester, inaccurate reporting of the last
menstrual period has been shown to be
more likely among girls who are closer
to the time of menarche when they become pregnant (Stevens-Simon, Roghmann, McAnarney, 1991).

This study showed that neonatal and
infant mortality rates increased as
maternal age decreased, but did not
show a similar trend for postneonatal
mortality. Infants of these younger
mothers are no more likely to die in
the postneonatal period, suggesting
that exogenous factors impacting infant survival beyond the first month of
life may not vary by maternal age.

A trend showing higher proportions
of inadequate prenatal care utilization
as maternal age decreased was also observed. Given the propensity for infants of younger mothers to suffer
poorer birth outcomes, efforts to identify very young pregnant women and to
intervene early in their pregnancies
with intensive prenatal care, appear
crucial.

Primigravidity was found to be protective against poor birth outcomes

3 also observed. Remarkably, a greater
Q proportion of the youngest mothers
(10-12 years) were more likely to be
married than the 13-year-old mothers.
Further, although a substantial amount
of data was missing, most of the fathers
of infants were adults rather than minors among the youngest mothers
(10-12 years). These data raise a number of questions regarding the possible
extent of force in the form of sexual
abuse, incest, and rape which may
have preceded these pregnancies and

appropriate role of health care providers, to pregnancies that occur to such
young mothers, especially when the father of the child is an adult? Also,
these findings pose questions regarding
why a substantial proportion of data
is missing, whether an effort should be
made to collect this information, and
whether an attempt to verify the data
should be made.

This study also showed dramatic evidence that very young adolescents are
at considerably greater risk for several
poor birth outcomes compared to both
national target figures and baseline
data for all women of reproductive
age. For young adolescents to meet
the target objectives for the nation,
a two- to six-fold improvement is
needed. The huge disparity between
young adolescents and all women, in
addition to the differences seen within
the young adolescent population,
clearly indicates the need to establish
independent goals and objectives for
improving birth outcomes of very
young adolescents.

The use of secondary data gathered
from vital records has inherent limitations, including only a narrow range of
available information. Previous studies
have controlled for the effects of one
or more of the following: alcohol, buying power, hypertension, infant’s sex,
interpregnancy interval, labor onset,
maternal height, parity, payment status, prepregnancy weight, reproductive history, smoking, toxemia, weight
gain, and ward status (Eisner et al.,
1979; Elster, 1984; Horon et al., 1983;
Lee et al., 1988; Leppert et al., 1986;
Scholl et al., 1984). While this study
points to young maternal age as a risk
factor for several poor birth outcomes,
these additional variables require attention as well.

From both a clinical and a public
health perspective, it is important to
identify and address the etiology of
preterm delivery among very young
adolescents in order to prevent preterm birth and subsequent low birth
weight and neonatal mortality. With 30
per cent of the youngest adolescents,
and 19 per cent of those 15 years of age
delivering infants preterm, it is critical
to establish a risk profile to help explain who is at increased risk and why.
While the predeterminants of preterm
birth are in all likelihood multifactorial, prevention and intervention efforts should be developed to target
specific predisposing mechanisms, such
as smoking, infection, etc. (Fuchs et
al., 1993). To the extent that gynecological or anatomical immaturity of
very young adolescents creates biological limits that prohibit young adolescents from carrying a pregnancy to
term, the appropriate intervention
may be different than if preterm delivery among these young mothers is

Social Biology

more often related to environmental
factors. Given the current paucity of
knowledge regarding the etiology of
preterm labor and delivery (Kramer et
al., 1992), a combination of primary,
secondary, and tertiary prevention efforts are indicated that would strive to
reduce unwanted pregnancy in young
adolescents, to intervene early in pregnancy through prenatal care efforts
aimed at improving the prospects of a
good outcome, and to assure the availability of an appropriate level of postdelivery medical care to decrease preventable mortality.

Findings from this study indicated a
higher risk of poor birth outcomes involving gestational age and neonatal
mortality in metropolitan (areas with
250,000 or more residents) versus nonmetropolitan (areas with less than
250,000 residents) areas. Because the
vital records used in this study do not
provide more precise measures of residency in terms of population size, it is
difficult to interpret these results. Further investigation of the influence of
urban residency on preterm birth and
neonatal mortality among very young
women who give birth in the United
States is needed.

A primary public health response to
young adolescent pregnancy is essential. The significant discrepancies in
birth outcomes among young adolescents, which, until now were lost in aggregate data, highlight the need for
pregnancy prevention strategies to be
inclusive of the youngest adolescents.
Although the birth rate among the
youngest mothers is relatively small,
these births reflect only a portion of
pregnancies to young adolescents. Furthermore, these births represent only a
portion of adolescents who are sexually
 

Vol. 42, No. 1-2

active. Clearly, primary prevention efforts to reduce adolescent pregnancies
must begin with children, before they
reach puberty. Currently, most schoolbased family life and sexuality education efforts are focused on youth in 7th
through 12th grades (Kenney et al.,
1989). This is too late for those who
become sexually active prior to junior
high. In addition, a timely school‘© based curriculum is only a partial so& lution. This strategy must be coupled
8 with a multitude of interventions that

& The results of this study also support
< the need for secondary prevention proE grams relating to birth outcomes of
~ young adolescents. To provide appro} priate care, age-specific risks must be

efforts must be based on this under< standing of risk. As indicated, the dis= parity of risk for poor birth outcomes is
A significant among young adolescents at
individual years of age. In addition, as
maternal age decreases, inadequate
prenatal care increases. Young adolescents need to be educated about the
benefits of prenatal care. Furthermore,
they need to be connected with appropriate social and medical services both
before and after delivery. Health and
social service practices must be sensitive to the increased needs of these
young mothers, their infants, and the

 

Maternal Age 33

fathers of these infants, and address issues specific to their health, social, cognitive, and physical needs.

As long as very young adolescents
continue to be at greater risk for extremely poor birth outcomes, tertiary
interventions addressing the multiple
needs of these infants and children
must be implemented. Infants born
preterm and at low birth weight are at
increased risk for an array of complex
medical problems (Peterson, 1988).
Those born very preterm and very
low birth weight are at even greater
risk for requiring long, complicated,
and exorbitantly expensive treatment.
Further, chronic health conditions may
result that require life-long interventions (Brown et al., 1980). Psychosocial and educational needs of children
born at very low birth weights are just
now being recognized, as these children are entering the school system
and requiring special educational services (Abel-Smith and Knight-Jones,
1990).

This study found very young adolescents to be at increased risk for a host
of poor birth outcomes. These discrepancies in risk are exacerbated when
compared to those of older adolescents
and women. Given both the human
and financial costs of very young adolescent births, an extensive public
health response is in order. Foremost is
the call for primary prevention.
