Coital Rates and Sex Ratios
in the South Pacific

A number of anthropologists have
recently cited my papers to support hy
potheses about which I have misgivings.

(Whiting, 1993; Martin, 1994; Brewis,
1993; Underwood, 1993). Since the
two latter papers appeared in this journal, I shall concentrate on them. As I
understand it, their argument is based
on two premises:

1. Sex ratio (proportion male at birth) is
positively related to parental coital
rate at the time of conception.

2. In their independent sets of Micronesian data, there was no evidence of
a decline in sex ratio with parental
age or parity.

Underwood infers that her data
“constitute a serious challenge to the
assumed universality of at least certain
aspects of Euramerican patterns of
marital sexual behavior.” Accordingly,
she hypothesizes a Micronesian pattern of marital sexuality in which coital
rates do not decline appreciably with
duration of marriage (within the reproductive years).

I should like to comment on both
premises in this argument.

CoITAL RATE AND SEX RATIO

If, as I proposed in my 1971 paper,
coital rate is a determinant of sex ratio,

 

then it must be a weak one. This conclusion follows from the facts that
though coital rates roughly halve
across the first year of marriage
(James, 1981, 1983), yet the concomitant decline in sex ratio of conceptions
(in the first and twelfth months of marriage) is only from about 0.522 to about
0.513 (Renkonen, 1970).

SEX RATIO AND MATERNAL AGE

It is clear that the decline in sex ratio
with maternal age (or with any of the
closely related variables, e.g., paternal
age, birth order, or duration of marriage) in large human populations is
very small indeed (James, 1987). For
instance, there were 21 million births
in England and Wales 1938-68. The
sex ratio of those to married women
aged 20-24 and 40-44 were 0.5152 +
.0002 and 0.5129 + .0006 respectively
(James, 1972). Standard power analysis Suggests that to stand 8 chances in
10 of detecting a difference of this magnitude in two equal-sized samples at
the 0.05 level (one-way), the samples
would each have to number more than
500,000. So the failure of Brewis
(1993) and of Underwood (1993) to detect such an effect in their comparatively minute samples can scarcely be

regarded as grounds for the inference
that the effect does not exist in Micronesia.

Peter de Vries (1969) wrote: “Sex in
marriage is like a medicine. Three
times a day for the first week. Then
once a day for another week. Then
once every three or four days until the
condition has cleared up.” In the absence of direct data to the contrary,
one might suppose that youth is just as

fleeting in the South Pacific as elsewhere.

Margaret Mead was memorably castigated by Evans-Pritchard for her
“‘wind-in-the-palm-trees”’ style of anthropological writing. It is not clear
whether the publication of four papers
ascribing strange powers to coital rates
in faraway places marks a return to romance in anthropology—or a mere
want of numeracy in anthropologists.
