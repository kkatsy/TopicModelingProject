ABSTRACT: Age-adjusted spouse correlations for performance on tests of specific cognitive
abilities were substantially higher for couples tested in Korea than for Americans of European or
Japanese ancestry tested in Hawaii. It was hypothesized that this greater spouse resemblance in

Korea may be due to cultural factors such as the Korean practice of arranged marriages.

Assortative marriage for specific cognitive abilities in two different ethnic groups
living in Hawaii was recently reported by
Johnson et al. (1976). Spouse correlations
in this Hawaii Family Study of Cognition
were estimated from samples of 148
couples who were Americans of Japanese
ancestry (AJA) and 555 couples who were
Americans of European ancestry (AEA).
Although AEA spouse correlations were
higher for 13 of 15 individual tests, in only
two cases (Subtraction and Multiplication;
Hidden Patterns) were these differences
significant. Furthermore, both sets of correlations were relatively low. The median
age-adjusted spouse correlations for the
AJA and AEA samples were only + 0.06
and +0.13, respectively.

The primary objective of the present
report is to extend the study of assortative
matriage to a third ethnic group living in a
different cultural setting. The data for this
cross-cultural comparison were obtained
in Korea during the course of a family
study conducted by Jong-Young Park
(Park, 1975). The cultures of the Korean
and Hawaiian samples differ considerably
more than those of the AEA and AJA
samples living in Hawaii; for example, one
cultural difference is the Korean custom of

arranged marriages. Thus, we hypothesize
that differences in the spouse correlations
between the Korean and Hawaiian samples may also be greater.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The 209 families tested were residents of
the city of Choon-Chun, capital of
Kang-Wong-Do Province, Republic of
Korea. The population of Choon-Chun is
approximately one hundred thousand.

Except for members of seven families
tested in one group session, each family
was tested individually as a nuclear family
unit. The tests employed were Korean
versions of those used in the Hawaii study
and are listed in Table 1. One test (the
Whiteman Test of Social Perception) was
sufficiently culturally loaded that it
proved impossible to produce an equivalent Korean version. An amended form of
this test was administered to maintain the
sequential integrity of the testing procedures across groups, but it was not included in the data analysis.

Other modifications of the test battery
were also required. Rather than simply
translating the Primary Mental Abilities
(PMA) Vocabulary Test into Korean, it
was necessary to construct a new Korean

vocabulary test using the same multiplechoice format. This project was accomplished in collaboration with two Korean
high-school instructors who teach the Korean language. Because of problems encountered in adapting the Education Testing Service (ETS) Word Beginnings and
Endings Test, only word beginnings were
used in the Korean version. Finally, appropriate Korean names and _ kinship
terms were used in the PMA Pedigrees
Test, and some of the object stimuli of the

Visual Memory Tests were replaced with
objects more familiar to the Korean subjects.

Estimated reliabilities for both the
Hawaiian battery and the Korean battery
are presented in Table 1. Reliabilities of
ten tests in the Korean battery were estimated from the data of the present study.
Estimates of reliability for the Korean vocabulary test and the Sheppard-Metzler
Mental Rotations Test were previously obtained by Park (unpublished) from data on

103 Korean high-school students. The two
remaining tests, Elithorn Mazes and PMA
Pedigrees, were so administered as to preclude a valid estimate of reliability from
the data of the present sample. Nevertheless, it may be seen from Table 1 that
estimated reliabilities for twelve of the Korean tests are highly similar to those of the
Hawaii battery. It was therefore concluded that the Korean battery is
psychometrically adequate and highly
comparable to the battery administered in
Hawaii.

In the Hawaii study, Wilson et al.
(1975) observed marked differences in
mean performance on these tests as a
function of age. Age correction of the
Hawaii data was therefore undertaken by
grouping the scores of adult subjects in
five-year intervals and expressing them as
z scores (Johnson et alJ., 1976). A similar
age adjustment was employed in the present study, although the age band was
seven years for those subjects between
ages 50 and 56, inclusive.

The factor structure of the Hawaii battery is nearly identical for the AEA and
AJA samples (DeFries et al., 1974) and
highly similar to that for an AEA group
tested with the same test battery on the
United States mainland (Zonderman et
al., 1977). Phenotypic correlations among
the 15 cognitive variables were obtained
for each of these three samples (AJA,
Hawaiian AEA, and Mainland AEA) and
were subjected to principal component
analysis with varimax rotations. Communalities of one were used, and the factors retained for rotation were those with
eigen values greater than one (Kaiser,
1960).

For each of these three samples, four
readily interpretable factors emerged:
spatial visualization, verbal, perceptual
speed and accuracy, and visual memory.
When the same analysis was undertaken
with the Korean family data, a four-factor

solution was again obtained (Park, 1975).
However, when the data were analyzed
separately as a function of sex and generation (parents vs. children), a more consistent and interpretable pattern of factor
loadings was observed when a five-factor
solution was forced. The factors were
labeled perceptual speed and accuracy, vi
-sual memory, word fluency, spatial rota
tion, and inference. Nevertheless, a factor
comparison analysis indicated considerable isomorphism of cognitive structure
across the AEA, AJA, and Korean samples (Park, 1975).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Age-adjusted spouse correlations for the
individual tests and for factor scores are
presented in Table 2 for the Hawaiian
AEA and AJA couples and for the Korean
couples. For purposes of comparison,
these spouse correlations are also presented for the mainland AEA sample.

It was previously noted that AEA
spouse correlations for 13 of the 15 individual tests were higher than those for
AJA couples and that the median correlations for AJA and AEA were +0.06 and
+0.13, respectively. Thus, although the
magnitude of the difference is not large for
these two ethnic groups living in Hawaii,
these results suggest that biological or cultural factors related to ethnicity may influence the extent and nature of assortative
marriage. That the effect of ethnicity on
assortative marriage may be considerable
is suggested by a comparison of the
Hawaiian and Korean samples. For all 14
tests included in the data analysis, the Korean spouse correlations are greater than
those of the Hawaiian AEA and AJA
samples. Except for one of these tests (Visual Memory, immediate), the differences
are substantial.

The differences between the Hawaiian
and Korean spouse correlations, however,
may in part be attributed to a difference in

method of test administration. As indicated previously, the tests in Korea were
administered to individual nuclear family
units. In contrast, as described in some
detail by Wilson et al. (1975), tests in the
Hawaii study were administered to large
groups under highly standardized conditions (automated tape and slide presentations of instructions, etc.). The Mainland
AEA sample is a valuable comparison
group in this respect, because tests in that
study were administered in the same manner as in the Korean sample (i.e., to individual nuclear family units). Thus, the effect of method of test administration may
be assessed directly by comparing the
Hawaiian and Mainland AEA spouse correlations. From Table 2 it may be seen
that Mainland AEA spouse correlations

 

are higher than those for the Hawaiian
AEA couples on 12 of the 15 individual
tests. However, the median spouse correlations do not differ markedly (+ 0.22 vs.
+0.13 for the Mainland and Hawaiian
AEA samples, respectively), and for only
two of the individual tests (Visual Memory, delayed; Pedigrees) are the differences
significant.

The Mainland AEA sample also provides a particularly valuable comparison
group for studying the effects of ethnicity.
It may be seen in Table 2 that 13 of the 14
Korean spouse correlations for the individual tests are greater than those for
Mainland AEA couples and that these differences are significant for 10 of the tests.
Since tests were individually administered
to nuclear family units for both of these

samples, method of test administration
cannot be readily invoked as a cause of the
difference.

The possibility of a greater heterogeneity in the Korean sample was also examined to determine if this factor could account for the higher spouse correlations.
When this possibility was investigated by
Park (1975), it was found that the
Hawaiian and Korean groups are highly
comparable samples with regard to such
variables as age, education, and occupational level.

One cultural factor which may cause a
greater spouse resemblance in Korea is
their custom of arranged marriages. Although this custom of seeking advice from
a “matchmaker” has been declining in recent years. it was in practice when the
present couples, who were all old enough
to have children at least 14 years of age,
were married. The custom of arranged
marriages may be briefly described as follows. Parents of young persons consult a
“matchmaker” to seek advice as to appropriate marriage partners. Family attributes, which are given considerable
weight by the matchmaker, include such
factors as reputation of the families, family status (e.g., nobility, commoner, or
“lowly”), family’s last name (cannot have
the same last name, even if there is no
known relationship in the ancestral record
for five-hundred or more years), and family’s lineage (cannot be cousins of any degree, even if of different last name). In
addition, ability level judged subjectively
and by scholastic achievement, personality, and appearance of the individuals and
their parents are also considered. It is
usually the case that the families involved
in arranged marriages have never met. Although most marriages are between persons from the same geographic area within
the matchmaker’s domain, propinquity in
the Western sense (e.g., met on the job or
attended the same school) is not a factor.

Assortative Marriage in Korea

315

The matchmakers are conscientious in
their selection of prospective mates and
sincerely try to make good matches, When
the matchmaker succeeds in finding a
prospective spouse, a relative is requested
to make unobtrusive observations firsthand. The procedure is structured in
such a way that neither family commits
itself at this point and either may withdraw without causing the other to lose
face. If the relative’s observations are congruent with the matchmaker’s report, the
young persons involved are informed of
the findings. Although they have the prerogative of requesting another choice, this
rarely happens because it would be considered as showing disrespect for elders.

For the reasons given above, the practice of arranged marriages is a cultural
factor which favors the marriage of individuals of similar ability and temperament. Thus, this practice may result in
higher spouse correlations in Korea, where
such factors as physical attractiveness and
sheer propinquity may be less important
than they are for Hawaiian and Mainland
couples.

It should be noted that the AJA and the
Hawaiian and Mainland AEA spouse correlations presented in Table 2 are lower
than those previously reported. In a recent
review by Jensen (1977), the unweighted
mean of 43 spouse correlations for various
tests of mental ability was +0.45. Several
factors may account for this apparent discrepancy. First, as discussed by both
Johnson et al. (1976) and Zonderman et al.
(1977), marked age effects will inflate the
spouse correlation. The highest obtained
correlation between spouses is with regard
to age (greater than 0.9). When test performance changes as a function of age, this
effect will contribute to the spouse correlation. In both of the above studies, age
adjustment of the test data was found to
lower spouse correlations. Furthermore,
as expected, this effect was more marked
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

316

in the Zonderman et al. study, where the
age range of the subjects was greater. It is
conceivable that at least some of the
spouse correlations reviewed by Jensen
(1977) may have been inflated by the presence of such age effects.

A second factor that must be considered
is the nature of the tests. The individual
tests in the Hawaii battery concern
specific cognitive abilities and are not
measures of IQ or “general intelligence”
(“g”). On the other hand, principal component scores (unrotated) obtained from
these tests do provide such a measure. It
may be seen in Table 2 that the Hawaiian
AEA and AJA spouse correlations for this
variable are also relatively low. Thus,
even though the nature of the tests may be
important, this factor does not seem to
account entirely for the lower spouse correlations obtained in the Hawaii study.

Another factor, which has already been
discussed, is the method of test administration. The use of different test administrators and the practice of administering
tests to individual couples may also lead to
inflated spouse correlations.

To the best of the authors’ knowledge,
this is the first report of assortative marriage for mental ability in an Asian popu

lation. By comparing spouse correlations
for the Korean sample with those previously reported for Hawaiian AJA and
AEA and for Mainland AEA couples, a
truly cross-cultural comparison was obtained. It was deduced from this comparison that cultural factors, such as arranged
marriages, may influence spouse correlations. Assortative mating influences the
correlation between relatives and the genetic variance in a population (Crow and
Kimura, 1970); thus, it may be seen that
cultural factors may have a marked effect
on the genetic composition of populations.
Results of the present study also suggest
that other factors such as age effects, the
nature of the tests, and the method of test
administration should be considered when
spouse correlations for various measures
of mental ability are compared.
