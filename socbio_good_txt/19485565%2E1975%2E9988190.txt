Suicide and Homicide as Causes of Death

and Their Relationship to Life
Expectancy: A Cross-cultural
Comparison

Gideon Vigderhous

Bell Canada Survey Research Group
Montreal, Canada

This paper will compare life expectancy
in countries with high suicide and homicide
rates before and after eliminating suicide
and homicide as causes of death. Only two
countries with high homicide rates, Colombia and Mexico, are included because of
the unavailability of complete demographic
data for other countries with high homicide
rates. The United States is included in the
study since both suicide and homicide rates
are relatively high.

In previous research (Silins and Zayachkowski, 1968; Preston et al., 1972; Schoen
and Collins, 1973), suicide and homicide
were not considered as independent causes
of death in constructing multiple-decrement
tables. Rather, the research focused primarily on calculating the hypothetical
gains in life expectancy resulting from
elimination of organic diseases such as respiratory tuberculosis, infectious and paraSitic diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.

The focus on suicide and homicide as
causes of death is of special interest to
sociologists and criminologists who attempt
to assess the impact of these social problems by employing a demographic model.

A traditional approach to assessing the

 

 

importance of various social problems has
been to evaluate their economic impact.
The President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice
presented its report on Crime and Its Impact—An Assessment (1967). In this report, willful homicide is estimated to cause
a loss of 750 million dollars. This figure
was reached by estimating the economic
loss of the worker’s productive life, the
financial burden on the victim’s dependents, medical bills before his death, etc.
The report (1967, p. 42) acknowledges the
fact that “The costs of lost or damaged
lives, of fear and of suffering, and of the
failure to control critical events cannot
be measured solely in dollars and cents.”
Any assessment of human life in terms of
dollars and cents creates uneasiness, since
life itself is regarded as the highest value
known to human beings.

The assessment of suicide and homicide
in terms of their impact on life expectancy
figures can be regarded as another approach to evaluating the importance of
these social problems. The question raised
is: What will be the average gains in life
expectancy resulting from the elimination

of suicide and homicide as causes of
death? Findings from this research cannot
be of direct relevance to social planning or
law enforcement agencies simply because
no consensus can be reached about how
many lost lives a given community can
tolerate before it begins to consider suicide
or homicide as a serious social problem. On
the other hand, the comparison of the
average gains in life expectancy by eliminating suicide and homicide in relation to
eliminating major causes of death, such as
cardiovascular diseases, can present a
meaningful demographic comparison of the
magnitude of the problem.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The mathematical-demographic model
where a single cause of death is eliminated
is known as the associated single-decrement
table (Jordan, 1952; Preston et al., 1972).
The theory and specification of such tables
is presented by Greville (1948, 1954),
Spiegelman (1968) and Preston et al.
(1972). By constructing a life table, it is
possible to divide the value of d, into specific causes of death, where d, is the number dying during each age interval for
every 100,000 persons born alive.

Following Greville (1948) and Spiegelman (1968), I adopted the following
mathematical-demographic model.

nD, — the number of deaths occurring during the period between
ages x and x + n.

nD, =a part of ,D, which denotes
death rates between ages x
and x-++7 resulting from a
specific cause (#}.

The probability of dying from a specific
cause (the ith cause) is:
De

We =

 

z

The data for the values ,D, and ,D,' are

Suicide and Homicide 339

available from published official statistics.
From the life table constructed by elimi
nating a specific cause of death (#), the

following relationships are observed:

fe — l — af.

The symbol (—i) denotes that a specific
cause of death was eliminated. ,r,—* equals
the proportion of observed deaths due to
all causes after the cause (i) was eliminated. If ,d, equals the number of persons
dying between exact ages x and x-+ 72,
then the ,d, which is attributed to cause 4
is approximated by the equation

nde! = ates dy.

The probability ,P.~* of surviving
years after reaching age x in a life table
when the specific cause of death (ith
cause) is eliminated is colog ,P,—-*=
nfo *colog ,P,. Here, »Ps is the value obtained from the life table when all causes
of death are present. The parameters for
the life table in which the cause i is eliminated are derived as follows: 1,4,7*=
L,—*. we and ada‘ — L--* — eta (Jz)
equals the number of survivors reaching
exact age x. The formula for deriving ,Z.—‘,
which is the life table population on the
number alive in the age group x to x -++ n,
was derived in the following way (see
Greville, 1954):

RESULTS

In the first step of the data analysis, the
aim was to compare suicide as a cause of
death to other major causes of death.
Quiriby et al. (1972, pp. 38-39) demonstrated that heart disease was almost unanimously ranked as the leading cause of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

340 Vigderhous

death in developed societies. In Portugal,
heart disease was ranked as the second
killer; in Japan, third; and in France,
second. For developing countries, heart
disease was ranked as the second leading
cause of death with the exception of the
Philippines, Taiwan, and Mexico where it
ranked fifth, fourth, and sixth, respectively.

Quinby et al. classified adult deaths
“according to a somewhat modified form
of the internationally recommended ‘Abbreviated List’? of 50 causes of death”
(1972, p. 2). The International Classification of Diseases was not used in the report
since the data were collected before the
classification went into effect. No breakdown was provided by Quinby et al. (1972)
on the specific breakdown of various heart
diseases.

The rank of suicide as a cause of death
varied considerably from one society to
another. The mean rank of suicide as a
cause of death was found to be 7.6. However, in Hungary it was ranked as the fifth
leading cause of death, and in New Zealand
and Norway it was ranked tenth. Quinby
et al. (1972) did not report data on suicide
in developing countries.

The data for this study were extracted
from the World Health Organization
Annual Epidemiological and Vital Statistics
(1964). A major concern in utilizing this
source of data is the assessment of its reliability and validity. Examination of suicide
and homicide data from 1953-70 revealed
that the rank ordering of countries with regard to suicide and homicide remained
stable for the entire period. This fact does
not imply, of course, that no change took
place in suicide and homicide rates during
these years.}

The establishment of the validity of the
data is a rather complex issue. With im

proved diagnosis of causes of death and
better collection, processing, and reporting
of official statistics, it can be assumed that
the level of validity of the data improved
as well. However, the accuracy of suicide
and homicide statistics may vary from
country to country.

The selection of countries for the demographic analysis was based on the magnitude of suicide and homicide reported for
the various countries and the availability
of epidemiological and demographic data.
The first country selected was Hungary,
which reported the highest suicide rate in
the world—28.6 per 100,000 persons in
1964. The suicide rate for males was 40.9
per 100,000. The life tables were constructed for males since men tend to commit suicide or to be victims of homicide
more often than women.

Table 1 presents only the final product
of the life table analysis for males in Hun

gary—the average remaining life expectancy for each age interval. The life expectancy was calculated for four different
categories. Column 1 presents the life expectancy when all causes of death are considered. Column 2 presents the average life
expectancy when suicide is eliminated as
a cause of death, and Column 3 when homicide is eliminated. Column 4 presents the
average life expectancy after the elimination of arteriosclerotic and degenerative
heart disease, generally considered to be
the leading cause of death among cardiovascular diseases. As stated previously,
since heart disease is the leading cause of
death in developed countries, the difference
between the values of Column 1 and all
the other columns will demonstrate the
gain in life expectancy when a specific
cause of death is eliminated; this is the
value (e~*). The average gain in life expectancy from eliminating suicide is 0.75 years

for newborn males (e)). Eliminating homicide, the average gain is much smaller, 0.07
years. By eliminating arteriosclerotic and
degenerative heart disease, the gain in average life expectancy was found to be 2.71
years, while the elimination of all forms of
heart disease more than doubles this figure.

The highest level of homicide reported is
for Colombia—25.5 per 100,000 persons.
Complete data on the average gain in life
expectancy for males in Colombia due to
the elimination of various causes of death
is presented in Table 2. From this table it
is evident that the elimination of homicide
as a cause of death will result in an average life expectancy gain of 1.32 years for
newborn males. The average gain in life
expectancy due to the elimination of heart
disease is relatively lower, 0.92 years. The
elimination of suicide will result in an average gain of 0.16 years.

In order to extend the cross-cultural perspective, Table 3 presents the life expectancy for males under one year of age for
different countries. The average gains in
life expectancy by eliminating suicide, homicide, and heart disease are shown for
each of eleven countries.

Preston et al. (1972) indicated that “‘the
effect of simultaneously eliminating two
cause-of-death processes from the population cannot be inferred from observing the
effect of eliminating each individually”
(1972, p. 51). A separate analysis was conducted combining suicide and homicide
into a single category, and the results
showed that the sum of average gain in
life expectancy with homicide and suicide eliminated individually approximated
rather well the average gain obtained when
both were considered simultaneously. Generally, the average gain in life expectancy
tends to be higher when both causes of
death are considered simultaneously.

death from suicide and homicide, I have
included infectious and parasitic diseases
in the analysis. The elimination of this
cause of death in developed countries
showed a higher average gain in life expectancy than that obtained by eliminating
homicide. However, the gain was relatively
small (0.09) on the average. The United
States was the only developed country
where elimination of homicide produced a
higher gain in life expectancy than the
gain achieved by eliminating infectious
and parasitic diseases.. For Colombia and
Mexico, the elimination of these diseases
produced a higher average gain in life expectancy than did the elimination of suicide, but less than homicide. However, the
gain was less than that produced by eliminating homicide as a cause of death. The
average gain in life expectancy was 0.94
for Colombia and 0.53 for Mexico.

SUMMARY

The demographic analysis in this paper
demonstrates the average gain in life expectancy after the hypothetical elimination of
various causes of death. For developed

countries, the elimination of heart disease
will usually increase the average gain in
life expectancy more than the elimination
of suicide and homicide together. Furthermore, the elimination of infectious and
parasitic diseases will increase the average
gain in life expectancy more than elimination of homicide as a cause of death. This
conclusion does not necessarily hold true
for developing countries, which have a
higher rate of violence, a higher rate of infectious and parasitic diseases, and a lower
level of heart disease than developed
countries.

The average gain in life expectancy for
the United States caused by the elimination of heart disease is 10.5 times higher
than the gain in life expectancy when suicide is eliminated. It is eleven times higher
than when homicide is eliminated. Hungary, which has the highest rate of suicide
in the world, will increase the average life
expectancy by less than a year by eliminating suicide.

These hypothetical results are not incompatible with the sociological treatment
of homicide and suicide as serious social
problems. Although from the demographic

perspective a more substantial gain in life
expectancy will result from eliminating
organic rather than social diseases, suicide
and homicide will continue to be of major
concern to society since both result in loss
of human life.
