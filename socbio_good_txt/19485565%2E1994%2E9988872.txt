ABSTRACT: This study examines factors impinging on the survival of children in Cameroon using
longitudinal data collected by the United Nations Demographic Training and Research Institute
of Yaoundé, Cameroon. It deals especially with the role of socioeconomic factors (mother’s
education, employment, marital status, ethnicity, and household income), housing characteristics (construction materials, power source, source of water supply, extent of crowding), and
immunization status on infant and child mortality. Two-state parametric and nonparametric
hazards models for the risk of death at any time within the course of the study are used, with
and without accounting for unmeasured heterogeneity. Overall, overcrowding has robust deleterious effects on infant and child survival. As regards the effects of socioeconomic variables, the
robustness of the effects of household income and ethnic differentials are unchanged, even after
controlling for unmeasured heterogeneity; the deleterious effects of marital status are also
apparent, but these effects are largely explained by unmeasured covariates. The data also suggest
that the protective effects of full immunization status are robust and not contaminated by
confounding factors, at least in the first 16 months of life. These findings provide solid ground
to support immunization programs and efforts as a means to reduce significantly infant and child
mortality.

In general, the high mortality of
developing countries is associated,
among other factors, with poverty,
ignorance, malnutrition, inadequate
quality of housing, lack of environmental sanitation, and low levels of
immunity. Many of these potential
determinants of mortality are highly
associated, and their effects are thus
mutually confounded.

Failure to control for confounding
variables can lead to erroneous associations between a factor and mortality.
For example, feeding method is highly
associated with child health. at birth;
and if poor health condition of the
child is a true cause of mortality, fail
ure to control for child health status
will produce an association between
feeding method and mortality. The
feeding regimen, however, may merely
be a marker of poor child health, and
not a true causal determinant of
mortality.

The goal of this study is to examine
factors impinging on the survival of
children in Yaoundé, Cameroon, using
data from the Yaoundé Infant and
Child Mortality Survey (YICMS). We
deal especially with the role of socioeconomic factors (mother’s education,
employment, marital status, ethnicity,
and household income), housing characteristics (construction materials,

power source, source of water supply,
extent of crowding), and immunization
status on infant and early child mortality. While the practice of primary
health care, along with other interventions, will probably lead to further reductions in the mortality of many developing countries, it is likely to be less
effective unless policies are based upon
a clear understanding of the factors
which influence the mortality patterns
in those countries (Walsh and Warren,
1979; Henderson, 1983; Mosley, 1983;
Halstead et al., 1985; DaVanzo and
Habicht, 1986; Caldwell et al., 1990;
Kunitz, 1990).

BACKGROUND

SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUND
AND CHILD SURVIVAL

Most studies of differential mortality in developing countries have not always disentangled the ways in which
the social, cultural, and economic characteristics of individuals and families
operate to impact the survival of children (e.g., Adamchak, 1979; Behm,
1983; Hobcraft et al., 1984; Akoto,
1990; Akin, 1991; Victoria et al.,
1992). Most often the mechanism is
surmised.

EDUCATION

Several studies have suggested that
child mortality in developing countries
is associated more closely with maternal education than with any other
socioeconomic factor (Caldwell, 1979;
Cochrane et al., 1980; Behm, 1983;
Caldwell et al., 1990; Gupta, 1990;
Hobcraft et al., 1984). This finding has
led some researchers to conclude that
the mother’s education is an important

Kuate Defo

Social Biology

and independent covariate of mortality. According to Caldwell (1986),
mother’s education is not a simple substitution variation for a set of other
variables with which it is correlated,
but produces its own impact. This inverse association has been attributed to
many causes: (a) Education helps
mothers break with traditional childraising practices and facilitates the acquisition of information related to family planning. The latter, through its
effects on spacing and timing of births
and pregnancies, acts to delay adolescent childbearing which is a risk factor
of infant and child mortality. (b) Education decreases fatalism about illness
and increased use of modern medical
facilities. (c) Education creates aspirations for upward social mobility and
the accumulation of wealth, enhances
the likelihood of outside female employment, reduces the perceived economic utility of children, and increases
availability of higher-quality foods
made possible by increased income.

_ Some joint effects have also been
described. Modernization and urbanization more generally are theorized to
influence mortality through, or jointly
with, education. Finally, there might
be “spillover effects’? which serve to increase the average level of education in
the community. However, in many settings, it is still not clear why education
is related to child survival.

HOUSEHOLD INCOME

The potential role of income-related
factors in child survival is complex,
mainly due to the multifaceted nature
of income itself (United Nations, 1985,
1986; Schultz, 1984). Household income may serve as an indicator of
children’s consumption of goods and
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

Vol. 41, No. 3-4

services that affect their health. However, despite the availability of numerous studies of the relationships between income and mortality, the
interpretation of such relationship is
not straightforward. A higher household income is expected to be associated with lower child mortality risks.
This assumption is based on the
premise that children in higher-income
households will consume more healthenhancing goods and services per capita than will children in lower income

- households. But higher income could
be obtained at the expense of extra

hours of work that reduce women’s
time spent in child care. If so, the effect
of income on mortality could be adverse. The relatively few studies focusing on the relation between infant
mortality and income at the household
level in developing countries found
consistently negative. associations.
These studies vary only in terms of explanatory power attributed to income
in relation to other factors (United
Nations, 1985).

ETHNICITY

Ethnicity has sometimes been identified as an important variable associated with child mortality (Morley et
al., 1963; DaVanzo et al., 1983; United
Nations, 1985; Blacker, 1991). In some
cases this relationship may be explained by the fact that certain customs
might strengthen or weaken a group’s
defenses against environmental haz
-ards (Blacker, 1991). Such practices

may include: (1) obstetric methods
used by traditional birth attendants, especially the type of dressing put on the
umbilical stump; (2) traditions affecting the duration of breastfeeding, including that of full or partial breast
Childhood Mortality

183

feeding and the appropriate period
before breastfeeding is discontinued;
(3) type and nutritional value of the
weaning foods generally given to infants and the methods of their preparation, particularly their susceptibility
to bacterial contamination; (4) traditional diets and food avoidances likely
to affect the nutritional status of pregnant and lactating mothers and hence
the birthweight of their children and
their own ability to breastfeed adequately; (5) other traditional practices,
particularly postpartum abstinence,
likely to affect birth spacing; (6) traditional treatments and remedies prescribed for childhood sicknesses, particularly diarrhea, with particular
reference to whether or not fluids are
withdrawn, and other practices likely
to aggravate the condition and weaken
the child; (7) traditional practices relating to sanitation and the disposal of
human excrement; (8) modes of living
that affect crowding; (9) child care and
childrearing practices.

Morley et al. (1963) drew attention
to the important influence of traditional beliefs and practices on measles
mortality and their contributing role
toward complications. In African
countries in general, and in Cameroon
in particular, groups are differentiated
primarily on the basis of language and
culture. In every ethnic group in
Cameroon, there is no disease other
than measles for which there has been
developed so impressive an array of
nursing care practices, dietary restrictions, and medicinal therapies. These
practices are likely to influence the
mortality, the severity, and the kinds
of temporary and permanent sequelae
which ensue. Among the mechanisms
by which ethnicity may influence child
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

184

survival, genetic elements should also
be considered. The most obvious of
these is the sickle-cell trait, which
protects against malaria but also contributes to infant mortality through
sickle-cell anemia, particularly among
populations of black origin. Although
many studies have suggested strong effects of ethnicity on mortality of children in Africa (Akoto, 1990; United
Nations, 1985; Cantrelle et al., 1986;
Hill and Randall, 1984), none have
been able to demonstrate the contingencies of the operation of these
effects.

MARITAL STATUS

Several studies have reported
higher mortality rates for out-ofwedlock children compared to children
of married women (Isaac and Feinberg, 1982; United Nations, 1973,
1986; Behm, 1983; Morley et al., 1968;
World Health Organization, 1978).
Several explanations have been proposed for such a relation: (a) higher socloeconomic status of currently married women as reflected, in particular,
in their higher educational attainment;
(b) it is possible that widowhood and
divorce are associated with substantial
stress, which in turn may affect child
health. By depriving the mother of a
principal means of support for her
childrearing activities, widowhood and
divorce may also have a calamitous
effect on her financial situation. These
effects are doubtless culturally mediated (Morley et al., 1968).

» The World Health Organization
(1978) suggests that much of this
higher mortality could be ascribed to
the fact that the birthweight distribution of babies of unmarried mothers

Kuate Defo

Social Biology

was lower. Some additional disadvantage of births to unmarried women resulted from their being born disproportionately to teenage mothers and to
women without previous births. It was
found in Latin America that the infant
mortality rate was consistently higher
for illegitimate than for legitimate
births, and differential being larger in
the postneonatal than in the neonatal
period, which suggests that it may be
produced principally by environmental
factors, including aspects of child care,
rather than by endogenous factors
present at a child’s birth (United Nations, 1986).

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HOUSING
CHARACTERISTICS AND MorTALITY

We examine the relationships of
child mortality and four pertinent
aspects of the dwelling place collected
by the YICMS survey: housing materials, water-supply, electricity (power
source), and crowding. In the survey,
data on these aspects of the dwelling
. place are based on the observation of

interviewers, which helps ensure accuracy in reporting. Housing characteristics are expected to exert an impact on
mortality because these conditions are
closely related to the risk of exposure
to infectious agents and the extent to
which residents are protected from environmental hazards (e.g., cold, heat,
wind, rain, air pollution).

The characteristics of the dwelling
place have long been recognized as an
important influence on infant and child
mortality. The majority of relevant
studies of the impact of housing conditions on mortality have focused on
the presence and type of water-supply,
the type of lavatory facilities, the

Vol. 41, No. 3-4

power source, and the type of building
materials used to construct the house.

Examination of some of the major
fatal diseases of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries strongly suggests
a relationship with housing and associated problems. Infectious diseases
were the major causes of death in Europe for most of the nineteenth century. In England and Wales in 1850,
they were responsible for some 60 per
cent of all deaths. Smallpox, because
of its highly infectious etiology, was
caused by direct or indirect contact
with a preceding case, and therefore
easily transmitted in overcrowded
living conditions (Kunitz, 1986).

Harrington’s (1974) study of West
African societies views a child’s chance
of survival as the outcome of a Series of
factors governing exposure to disease
and those encompassing the course and
outcome of disease. These factors can
be summarized as exposure and resource variables, the former group
including environmental and socioeconomic elements and the latter containing such components as nutritional status and access to medical care.

The type of dwelling affects mortality mainly through the elements of exposure. Benjamin (1965) contends that
the most important effects of housing
conditions on health work through
their impact on the incidence of infectious diseases, in particular diarrheal
diseases which he found to increase in
prevalence in England and Wales with
the incidence of crowding. Particularly
problematic were instances where
rooms are used for both day-to-day living and sleeping and where more than
one family shared the same sanitary
facilities. These types of situations are

185

not uncommon in ‘Yaoundé in popular
neighborhoods such as Mokolo, Briqueterie, and Nkoldongo.

The role of infectious disease in mediating the effect of the family dwelling
on child mortality has been noted by
others. Feachem (1984) points out that
of the infectious diseases related to water supply and lavatory facilities, diarrheal diseases are of the greatest im
‘portance and that the reduction of

these diseases would be the major benefit of programs launched to improve
dwelling units and the facilities therein.
It is now well known that water, if not
purified and safe, can carry dangerous
diseases and consequently, cause considerable morbidity and mortality in
the population. In developing countries, safe water supply is a problem
and the rural population of these countries is more exposed to such risks. In
countries like Cameroon where limited
resources are available for the health
sector (Ministry of Plan and Regional
Development, 1986), only low-cost
welfare services are possible. This argument is supported by the findings of
Butz and his colleagues (1984) in Malaysia, that breastfeeding has a larger
protective effect on infant mortality
in areas where sanitary facilities are
poorer.

However, these housing and health
studies have usually failed to separate
or take into account the multifactorial
nonhousing variables with which they
are highly correlated or which affect
health (e.g., social class, social status,
income, employment, neighborhood
of residence, poverty, ignorance, poor
health and lack of medical care). This
difficulty in isolating the effects of
bad housing on health from other

186

predisposing factors, which often accompany it, is compounded as one
moves back in time (Schultz, 1984).

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
IMMUNIZATION STATUS AND CHILD
SURVIVAL

In developing strategies to combat
child mortality, we find that a number
of research issues arise. Governments
in developing countries often assume
that the optimal route to lower child
mortality is through expansion of the
formal health sector. Recently, however, this assumption has been called
into question with arguments that too
much emphasis is still being placed on
short-term vertically organized public
health interventions and modern medical institutions at the expense of social
and economic development. The apparent reduction in the rate of mortality decline after a period of rapid
progress has helped to convince some
that the current approach to health
care in developing societies is not appropriate to the disease environment
(Gwatkin, 1980; Palloni, 1981). While
the importation of medical technology
in the form of vaccines has reduced or
in some areas even eliminated such diseases as smallpox, now it is argued that
a much greater proportion of infant
deaths is due to diseases the prevention
of which appears to be responsive to
improved personal hygiene (Mosley,
1985).

Whether access to and utilization of
current health facilities guarantee significant reductions in child mortality is
perhaps the most important question
(Foster, 1984; Koenig et al., 1991; Clemens et al., 1988). As the immunity derived from the mother declines markedly, a large majority of children over

 

Kuate Defo

six months of age become susceptible
to infectious diseases (World Health
Organization, 1981). The six diseases
(measles, pertussis, diphtheria, tuberculosis, tetanus, poliomyelitis) of the
Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in general and measles in
particular continue to cause serious
child morbidity and mortality in Africa
and require further epidemiological
work (Feachem and Jamison, 1991).

It is estimated that worldwide, these
infectious diseases kill ten children
with each passing minute and disable
ten more, measles being responsible
for one-third of these deaths and disabilities (Assaad, 1983; Henderson,
1983). Recent estimates suggest that 1
out of every 10 children in Africa dies
of measles (Rodriguez, 1991). Vaccination can be a powerful tool in the
control of some of these diseases and
other causes of childhood death (for a
review, see Anderson and May, 1982).
Unfortunately, in sub-Saharan African
as a whole, vaccine uptake was still low
in 1986. Only 20 per cent of African
children had received, by the end of
their first year of life, a complete
course of vaccination against the six
EP] diseases (Feachem and Jamison,
1991).

On the other hand, the influence of
immunization in preventing mortality
has been controversial, and vaccination may not be a panacea. The kind of
problem one faces in studies of immunization status and child survival can
be illustrated by the question: ‘“What is
the ultimate effect of preventing an infant death by immunization?” The immediate mortality may be prevented,
but the environment may not be altered in any way, and the susceptibility

to further attacks therefore remains

Vol. 41, No. 3-4

high. If death in these subsequent cases
is also prevented by, say, measles vaccine, is the child’s susceptibility to
death from other diseases increased?
Does the lowering of the death rate in
the shorter term imply an offsetting
increase in a somewhat longer term?

Among the economically advantaged populations of all countries, infant and childhood mortality rates are
generally lower. In such populations, it
is often difficult to demonstrate the influence of a single intervention to improve health status or survival. SimiJarly, in economically disadvantaged
populations, the impact of a single
health care intervention may be hidden
by many other factors that contribute
to mortality. An argument has also
been made that measles vaccination
did not result in improved overall child
survival (Hendrickse, 1975; Kasongo
Project Team, 1981). But other data
have suggested that measles vaccine
has not only a major protective effect
on immediate infant and child survival,
but also that its residual effects contribute to reduce malnutrition and mortality from other diseases for many subsequent months (Morley et al., 1963;
Clemens et al., 1988; Koenig et al.,
1991; Aaby et al., 1993). But, the magnitude of the impact of immunization
in general and measles vaccine in particular on prevention of mortality may
be dependent on the age at vaccination
and other factors that contribute to
childhood mortality.

We assess the influences of full
immunization on mortality in a Cameroonian setting. The following age
schedule of immunization is used in
Cameroon: DPT and poliomyelitis No.
1 plus BCG at 6~8 weeks, DPT and poliomyelitis No. 2 one month later, DPT

187

and poliomyelitis No. 3 one month
later, and measles at 9 months. A child
was considered fully immunized by age
t if he/she had completed all his/her
appropriate immunizations by that
age. We will control for a number of
potential inhibiting factors discussed
above in order to evaluate the effects
of immunizations on child survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
~ DATA

We analyze a remarkably rich data
source, the Yaoundé survey carried
out by the Institut de Formation et de
Recherche Démographiques (IFORD)
survey of Yaoundé, Cameroon, to investigate the determinants of child survival. This survey was carried out from
January 1978 to January 1981. The survey was designed to measure levels
and patterns of maternal health during
the first two years post-partum, and its
demographic, biomedical, cultural and
socioeconomic determinants. The information was collected through a twostage process of follow-up interviews.

The first stage was initiated with the
registration at maternity wards (hospitals) of newly delivered mothers who
were residents of Yaoundé. The information gathered at this stage included
demographic, cultural, and socioeconomic characteristics of the woman
and her partner, characteristics of the
pregnancy and of the newly born child.

The second stage consisted of seven
waves of interviews with the women or
their surrogates. The interviews took
place 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 months
after delivery. These interviews were
designed to collect information on characteristics of the household, timing of
following conception, breastfeeding

188

regimens, and health conditions of the
mother and the child. The survey contained information on maternal episodes of illnesses collected at each
wave. These data have been described
and assessed elsewhere and found of
good quality (IFORD, 1987; Kuate
Defo, 1992; Kuate Defo and Palloni,
1992).

As in most African countries, in
Cameroon the levels of mortality
within the boundaries of large cities are
lower than in surrounding areas and
the countryside. As estimated from the
WES, infant mortality for Cameroon
during the year 1978 stood at about
0.106. This figure is roughly 1.9 times
higher than the level estimated for
Yaoundé from the Yaoundé survey under study. Clearly, the data from this
survey cannot be representative of
the entire country. But, is it a good reflection of conditions prevailing in
Yaoundé? The evidence available to us
suggests that it is.

First, using the World Fertility Survey data for Cameroon, Ferry (1983)
showed that approximately 90 per cent
of births in Yaoundé occurred in the 11
maternity wards surveyed by this survey. Second, in separate studies, Disaine and Garsen (1983) and Garsen
(1985) estimated that about 88 per cent
of the population of Yaoundé was covered by the survey. Finally, Houehougbe (1985) and Garsen (1985) argue convincingly that the fraction of
births that occurred outside the maternities surveyed by the Yaoundé survey
is likely to have a negligible impact on
mortality estimates. In fact, if we conservatively assume that between 10 and
12 per cent of the births are missed and
that these births experience the highest
levels of infant mortality observed for

Kuate Defo

Social Biology

any group in the sample, we are led to
errors of about 3.72 per 1,000 births,
which is within a 95 per cent confidence
interval constructed with the estimated
sampling error. Thus, although the
mortality conditions assessed by the
Yaoundé survey do not reflect national
conditions, they should provide a very
good yardstick to evaluate conditions
in Yaoundé and in similar cities in
Cameroon.

STATISTICAL METHODS

While we are chiefly interested in
the effects of soctoeconomic and housing characteristics and immunization
status, we locate these factors within a
more complex causal framework that
includes proximate as well as background variables. The models we formulate are designed to minimize some
of the problems of simultaneity, spuriousness, and selection that were discussed earlier.

The model we pose is a two-state
hazards model for the risk of death at
any time within the course of the study:

u(Z(t)) = po(Hexp(BZ()) (1)

Where u(t;Z(t)) is the risk of dying in
the interval (t, t+ dt) for a child with a
vector of characteristics Z(t), p(t) is
a baseline hazard. and 6 is a vector of
effects. |

For most variables that change over
time, we have monthly information.
However, we have adopted a conservative strategy to minimize errors of
response. In particular, we will estimate effects assuming that we observe
events in discrete segments: 0, 1-3,
4-7, 8-11, 12-15, and 16-23. When a
death occurs within a segment, it is
assigned to the middle. Experiments
with alternative solutions, including

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

Vol. 41, No. 3-4

the use of observed age at death, do
not change our results in any significant
way. Censoring times are also assigned
to the middle of the segment because,
unlike the timing of death, their exact
values are not known. Selected fixed
and time-varying covariates are defined in Table 1. We use the following
general rule to assign values to the
time-varying covariates: let Z(t) be the
value of the time-varying covariate at
time t and t< TJ, where T is the lower
value of an age segment selected for
analysis (T = 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, 16). Its
value can be either 0 or 1 depending
on the occurrence (nonoccurrence) of
an event before the child enters the
segment (7,;7+n). For example, the
value of full breastfeeding for a child
who is followed to 4 months will be 1 if
he/she initiated supplementation or
stopped breastfeeding any time before
month 4, and 0 otherwise. Similarly,
the value of following conception will
be 1 if the mother experienced a conception sometime before 4 months
postpartum.

Estimation of Model (1) proceeds
under two different assumptions about
the baseline hazard, w(t). The first is
that it can be represented as a piecewise constant with nodes at 1-3, 4-7,
8-11, 12-15, and 16-23 months (Tables
3 through 5). This strategy is designed
to circumvent the proportionality assumption inherent in conventional hazards models (Cox, 1972). The second
is that it can be efficiently represented
by a Weibull hazard (Table 6). This
assumption is pertinent in that the
Weibull distribution is widely used in
reliability theory and has been shown
to represent well the duration structure
of infant and childhood mortality (e.g.,
Choe, 1984).

will be calculated as follows:

for all vaccinated children.
RESULTS
FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF MAJOR
VARIABLES

Table 2 presents the sample proportions of target independent variables.
In general, there is a stability of the frequency distribution of categories of
these variables in various age segments
considered. There is a discrepancy between the proportions of educated versus employed women. These figures
probably reflect the fact that because
of childbearing and childrearing, most
of the educated women in Yaoundé
do not work. On average, less than half
of families have income higher than
20,000 CFA francs, and about onethird of families have income between
20,000 and 50,000 CFA francs. The
major ethnic groups in Yaoundé reflect
the picture of ethnic group distribution
in the country. The ethnic groups of
the Centre-South and the West provinces are the most important groups.
Although generally low, the level of
immunization coverage seems to increase with age for all vaccines as well
as for full immunization status. Only 32
per cent of children have completed all
their immunizations by their first birthday; this percentage rises to 44 per cent
by their second birthday. More than
two-thirds of children end up having
their BCG and DPT-polio (1st dose) by
their second birthday, but only 39 per

28 per cent get their DPT-polio (3rd

their measles vaccine before the required age of 9 months, some 25 per
cent by their first anniversary, and only
about 43 per cent by their second birthday.

As regards housing characteristics,
not all the construction materials are of
the same standard. Only about 12 per
cent of walls are modern, while about

80 per cent of dwelling places have
modern roofs and 60 per cent modern
floors. Some 37 per cent of households —
have electricity as power source, that
is, only about one-third of households
can refrigerate their food. Some 70 per
cent of the households have access to
clean water. The level of overcrowding
is quite high in Yaoundé. In at least 30
per cent of families, the index child
shared the room with more than 3 persons, and this proportion rises to 48 per
cent by the time the child is 2 years old.

EFFECTS OF SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS
ON CHILD SURVIVAL

The piecewise hazards estimates of
the effects of socioeconomic variables
on child survival are shown in Table 3.

Model 1 shows that, in general, all
these factors have primary influences
on infant and child mortality. The protective significant effects of mother’s
schooling and employment are limited
to the neonatal period and 16-19 completed months, with an improperly
signed effect of maternal education for
4—7 months. It is possible that in addition to biological factors affecting neonatal mortality, cultural factors also
play an important role. Household income appears to have strong effects
at least until the age 16-19 months.
Children of unmarried mothers are at a
disadvantage across all age intervals.
The other ethnic groups are generally
worse off than the referent ethnic
group (i.e., ethnic groups from the
West).

In Model 2, maternal education,
employment, marital status, and
household income are entered simultaneously in the regression- equation.
The estimates suggest that the effects
of maternal employment and mother’s
martial status are largely explained by
her household income level, but the effects of unwed motherhood remain unexplained in 20-23 months. The pat
-tern of effects of maternal education

remains unaffected by these controls.

Model 3 adds ethnicity to the estimation equation. While the pattern of
ethnic differentials persists, the magnitude of the effects of maternal schooling in the neonatal period are somewhat reduced, but the magnitude and

Kuate Defo

direction of effects of the other factors
remain virtually unchanged. This result suggests that to some extent, the
maternal-education relation in the
neonatal period is partly explained by
the mother’s ethnic identity which reflects practices, rituals, and taboos surrounding birth. The ethnic groups of
the North region appear to be the most
disadvantaged in the neonatal period
(p < 0.01).

The impact of a control for quality
of neighborhood of residence and season of birth is marginal to estimated effects from the previous model (results
not shown). Once a control is introduced for household characteristics
(Model 4), the protective effects of maternal schooling are restricted to the
age 16-19 months, but the deleterious
effects of education in 4-7 months are
still not accounted for. The effects of
household income are restricted to the
first 8 months of life. Ethnic differentials remain virtually unchanged. Thus,
household characteristics basically capture any noticeable effects attributable
to household income after the first year
of life.

In Model 5, we investigate the possibility that poor pregnancy outcomes
may explain socioeconomic differentials in mortality. Of interest is the persistence of the effects of maternal
schooling and household income. In
the first month, being of the ethnic
groups of the Center-South region is an
advantage once these variables are accounted for, and the magnitude and
Statistical power of the disadvantage
associated with the ethnic groups of the
North region is somewhat reduced.
These results indicate that at least in
the neonatal period, biological factors

(health conditions at birth) seem to explain most of the ethnic differentials in
mortality.

After a control for maternal reproductive patterns (maternal age, parity,
survival status of preceding sibling)
(Model 6), the disadvantage of the eth
nic groups of the North in the neonatal
period is eliminated, and the relative
advantage of the ethnic groups of the
East in the same period regains statistically significant explanatory power.
Thus, childbearing practices (particularly adolescent childbearing) appear

to explain the disadvantage of the ethnic groups of the North and East regions, and to reinforce the biological
argument suggested above for ethnic
differentials in neonatal mortality. The
ethnic differentials associated with the
other age intervals (particularly the
disadvantage of the ethnic groups of
the Center-South in 16-19 months) remain unexplained. Income differentials persist as well.

The possibility that socioeconomic
differences in mortality (notably ethnic
differences) could reflect differences in
breastfeeding practices was sought, but
there is no such evidence (results not
shown). Similarly, controls for following conception with and without con
trolling for breastfeeding patterns have
no effects on the magnitude, direction,
and sign of estimated effects in the previous model (results not shown).

In Model 7, we investigate the possibility that the differentials noted so
far could be mediated by differences in
health care services utilization. The results lend no support to this conjecture. The possibility that observed
mortality differentials by socioeconomic factors could be due to the poor
health of the child over time was
sought as well (Model 8), but once
again, these differentials remain, particularly income and ethnic differentials in the first year of life. In a similar
vein, we investigated the possibility

marginal impact could be identified.

(piped or well water) are protective for
child survival, while overcrowding
(more than three persons sharing the
room with the index child) has deleterious effects on child survival. This
general pattern is also age-dependent.
In particular, the advantage associated
with a modern roof is restricted to the
neonatal period. It is clear that in the
neonatal period, the greatest advantage derives from living in a house constructed from modern materials, from
the availability of power source (elec
tricity) and clean water, and from hav
 

ing fewer than three persons share the
room with the newborn.

Model 2 investigates the possibility
that these primary associations might
be confounded by the socioeconomic
characteristics of the family (mother’s
education, employment, marital sta
' tus, household income, ethnicity) or by

the neighborhood of residence within
the city. Such possibility exists for the
protective effects attributable to modern wall construction, and availability
of electricity and clean water. In fact,

controlled, some of the effects reverse
signs and turn into a disadvantage as in
the case of electricity in 4—~7 months
and piped water in the first month. But
the effects of crowding remain unchanged by these controls. Modern
roofing retains its protective effects in
the neonatal period and its disadvantage in the postneonatal period is reversed and even significant in 4-7
months. It is likely therefore that the
influences on mortality of housing con
struction materials and availability of .

electricity and clean water in families
are mainly mediated by the socioeconomic status of these families.

-The possibility that health conditions at birth might explain the remaining effects noted above was also sought

(Model 3). There is evidence that the
residual effects of the availability of
electricity or clean water in the first
month are explained by the poor
health of the newborn (e.g., poor pregnancy outcome). These controls did
not affect the significance of the effects
of a modern roof and overcrowding over time. Furthermore, controls for
maternal reproductive patterns (age ©
and parity) and survival status of the
preceding sibling leave these results
unchanged. Similar results were found
after introducing controls for breastfeeding patterns and timing of following conception, and prenatal care visits
(results not shown).

We also explore the possibility that
child health could account for the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

202

relationships between housing charac- .
teristics and mortality (Model 4). It°
appears that child health does not’
confound previous relationships. A
similar conclusion is reached after controlling for maternal health (Model 5)
or immunization status of the child
(Model 6).

Overall, overcrowding has direct
and robust deleterious effects on infant
and child survival. The greatest advantage derives generally from living in a
house constructed from modern materials with modern amenities, although
the mortality of children living in
houses with nonmodern materials or
without access to electricity or clean
water is sometimes almost as low as
—or even lower than—that of their
modern material counterparts. A possible explanation of this anomaly is
that a modern housing structure could
indicate hastily constructed temporary housing using modern materials
which degenerate into modern slums,
whereas traditional housing may have
received greater care in construction.
The tendency for a modern facility to
exhibit the lowest mortality risks is
maintained with regard to modern wall
construction.

EFFECTS OF IMMUNIZATION STATUS
ON CHILD SURVIVAL

Table 5 presents the estimated effects of full immunization status on
infant and child mortality. The gross
effects (Model 1) indicate that full immunization status is associated with
significant reduction in mortality at
least up to 16-19 months of age. These
results are virtually unaffected by a
control for socioeconomic background
of the family (Model 2). Once ethnicity is accounted for, the robustness of

Kuate Defo

Social Biology

the protective effects of full immunization is restricted to the first 16 months
of life (Model 3). These protective effects of full immunization remain unchanged after controls for neighborhood of residence (Model 4), housing
characteristics, availability of electricity or clean water in the family, and
overcrowded family structure (Model
5), health conditions of the child at
birth (Model 6), and maternal reproductive characteristics (Model 7).

The possibility that maternal antibodies (through the immunological
properties of breast milk) could inhibit
some of the effects attributable to full
immunization status was sought
(Model 8). There appears to be no evidence whatsoever that breastfeeding
patterns mediate the protective effects
of full immunization on child survival.
Further controls for prenatal care
checkups (Model 9), child health over
time (Model 10), or maternal health
status over time (Model 11) did not
modify these conclusions.

In terms of the efficacy of full immunization status of children on their
survival prospects, the efficacy of full
immunization Is strongest in the first 4
months of life (about 90 per cent,
p<0.01) and decreases as the child
ages to a level of about 40 per cent by
the end of the second year of life. It is
important to notice that the efficacy of
full immunization in saving children’s
lives peaks at 1-3 months and later at
8-11 months. The peak at 8-11
months probably reflects the overwhelming role of measles vaccine for
saving children’s lives in this age group
where measles morbidity and mortality
peaks in Cameroon. Thus, there is no
evidence that full immunization status
has limited or no protective effects on

referred to in the literature as the problem of unmeasured heterogeneity
(e.g., Trussell and Rodriguez, 1990;
Rogers, 1992; Gill, 1992). To test
whether or not our results are sensitive
to omitted covariates, we use a Weibull
hazard model with nonparametric heterogeneity (Heckman and Singer,
1984). We choose nonparametric heterogeneity over parametric heterogeneity since the results of the latter are
very sensitive to the distribution imposed on the unknown covariate(s)
(Trussell and Richards, 1985). In addition, since we are fairly certain that the
duration structure of child survival is
well represented by a Weibull, we are
in a position to minimize the identification problems that plague hazard
models with unmeasured heterogeneity (parametric or nonparametric).
Table 6 presents the results of the
effects of measured covariates within
a continuous-time hazards framework,
with and without accounting for unmeasured heterogeneity. The first 7
models are nested models incorporat
ing stepwise controls, and the last two

models (8 and 9) incorporate a control
for unmeasured variables. If the estimated effects show no change, our
inferences regarding the estimated
effects receive further confirmation.

As regards the effects of socioeconomic variables, the robustness of the
protective effects of household income
(p < 0.01) and ethnic differentials are
unchanged, even after controlling for
unmeasured heterogeneity. In general,
the referent ethnic groups (i.e., ethnic
groups of the region of West) are at an
advantage. The deleterious effects of
marital status are also apparent, but
these effects are largely explained by
unmeasured covariates.

Kuate Defo

Social Biology

The general results for housing
characteristics show that a family with

‘modern wall and roof housing has

the greatest survival advantage, while
a family with more than three persons
in the room of the index child suffers
the greatest disadvantage, even after
accounting for unobserved heterogeneity.

Finally, the protective effects of full
immunization status of the index child
on his/her survival over the first two
years of life is robust and insensitive to
unmeasured heterogeneity. This lends
support to the argument that immunization directly saves lives of children.

Overall, a comparison of Model 7
with Models 8 and 9 in Table 6 shows
that the introduction of nonparametric
heterogeneity with two points of support (additional points of support
could not be estimated) has no impact
on the estimated effects. These results
suggest that the estimates are indeed
robust.

DISCUSSION

Overall, the data suggest that household income has robust effects on child
survival and that there are substantial

ethnic differentials in mortality in

Yaoundé. These ethnic differentials
are possibly mediated by behavioral
mechanisms in the postneonatal period
and beyond. Maternal schooling shows
no clear pattern of effects on child
survival in this setting. Similar results
of the poor performance of maternal
schooling as an explanatory factor of
infant and ‘child mortality in urban
Africa were found by Mbacke and van
de Walle (1989) in Bobo Dioulasso in
Burkina Faso. It is generally suggested
that income can only affect child

mortality through other factors
(United Nations, 1985). We found
strong income effects even after controlling for unmeasured heterogeneity:

The persistence of ethnic differentials
in mortality, although all groups are assimilated into the general urban cultural environment, suggests that there
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

still remains a considerable degree of
difference among these groups in their
health beliefs and practices.

The data generally suggest that the
hazards to health arise mainly from
overcrowding, unhygienic methods of
construction, inadequate and impure
water supplies, and the arrangements
for cooking and storage of food. If
housing structure variables are important determinants of child survival,
much of their impact would be retained
when other socioeconomic variables
are introduced; which proves to be the
case for overcrowding throughout this
research. Overcrowding has direct and
robust deleterious effects on infant and
child survival. This importance of overcrowding within households as a factor
in the spread of infectious disease has
recently been highlighted in Africa.
Although bad housing can clearly facilitate the transfer of communicable
diseases, it is not possible to isolate the
house as a physical structure from the
external environment in which it is located, or from the wider social and economic environment of its occupants.
On the other hand, while poor housing
almost always accompanies  overcrowding, poor sanitation, poor diet,
and a generally poor standard of living
as part of the cycle of deprivation, improved housing could even result in an
increase in mortality when higher rents
mean that there is less to spend on
food, treatment of recurrent infections, and general health of the household, and the most vulnerable are children. The tendency for most modern
facilities to exhibit the lowest mortality
risk is maintained with regard to modern wall construction. While one would
have expected mortality to be lower

Childhood Mortality

where running water is available inside
the house, and also where electricity is
available, we found no such tendency.
These deviations have been observed
elsewhere in Africa (United Nations,
1985). In Ghana, better housing structure, particularly at intermediate levels, does not improve the survival status of children. Deviations from the
expected patterns were also found in
Sierra Leone where the child mortality
in houses with water taps in the household yard is higher than that associated
with the water supply from public taps,
and in the Sudan, where the mortality
level related to pipes in the compounds
is Slightly higher than that in the households obtaining water from village
pipes. It should be noted that piped
water in some areas is more subject to
the risk of contamination than water
from wells or streams, particularly
where the water-supply system is
not well maintained. This explanation
is plausible in Yaoundé where there
are frequent interruptions of running
water in the city.

This study has shown that vaccines
remain one of the most effective
disease-prevention technologies available and have the potential to significantly reduce mortality in infancy and
childhood. We found that full immunization status could prevent as much as
90 per cent of deaths due to lack of immunization in the first 4 months and
about the same proportion at 8-11
months where measles is most prevalent in Cameroon (Direction Nationale
du Deuxiéme  Recensement/IRD,
1992). Currently, there are three
diseases—neonatal tetanus, pertussis,
and measles—which contribute significantly to childhood mortality and

208

which are amenable to prevention by
immunization of the mother and/or the
child. In most developing countries,
however, little impact has been made
on mortality from these diseases because of low coverage of the population by vaccine programs (in the range
of 10 to 30 per cent) (Aaby and Clements, 1989). These preventable childhood infectious diseases not only kill
many children of the Third World, but
additionally many have after-effects
that leave the survivors handicapped
for life. Effective, safe vaccines have
greatly reduced the incidence of diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, tuberculosis, measles and poliomyelitis.
Improved techniques of immunization
and of simple cold storage systems
have also contributed to the effectiveness of immunization efforts. This
study provides further evidence that
full immunization against diphtheria,
pertussis, tetanus, tuberculosis, measles, and poliomyelitis can effectively
reduce the incidence, lethality and
mortality of these diseases in infancy
and childhood. These findings are important and need to be incorporated
into the national vaccination policy
since immunization coverage is still
low.

There is an urgent need for intensification of immunization — efforts
through amalgamation of the preventive and curative services in Cameroon,. especially for children attending health centers for medical care.
Those who attend to sick children must
also accept the responsibility of initiating or completing their immunization
programs. One possible strategy for increasing coverage is the routine and

Kuate Defo

obligatory immunization of all children
presenting for episodic care in medical
facilities, public and private. Each
child attending a health center for clinical consultation should be screened as
to immunization status and those currently in need should be immediately
immunized. It is not known whether
vaccination integrated with episodic
care will effect sufficient coverage of all
subgroups to assure the attainment of
program objectives without additional
efforts. The advantages of beginning
from the general health services are
both managerial and technical. Overburdened clinics are unlikely to accept
the additional burden of immunization
when parallel vertical programs exist
which are designed to do only immunizations (e.g., EPI). Monitoring and
evaluating programs could include,
among other things, monitoring the
prevalence and mortality of preventable diseases, studying vaccine uptake
and efficacy, exploring the reasons behind the nonacceptance of programs,
identifying local groups with low vaccine coverage, and evaluating the impact of different strategies to expand
vaccine coverage.
