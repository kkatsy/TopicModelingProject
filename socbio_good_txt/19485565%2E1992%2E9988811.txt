© ABSTRACT: While numerous studies have reported differential assortative mating coefficients for

oo Personality traits, little research has centered on cross-sample comparisons to determine their
© degree of generalizability. The present investigation examines the assortative mating coefficients
<- for scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) from five separate studies.
© An examination of these patterns of significant coefficients offers little support for this cross= sample generalizability. No significant correlations resulted between these studies in their co— efficients, even when the unreliability of the different measures was controlled. It is concluded
= that there is little evidence to support statements of differential importance in assortment for
‘e personality variables beyond the sample under investigation.

oO

A Human assortative mating (homogCamy) has been reported in research
since the beginning of the century
o (e.g., Pearson and Lee, 1903). Recent
‘Ereviews of this research have noted
“that assortment is evident for a variety
Sof characteristics including — intelli2 gence, personality, physical traits, reS ligion, psychiatric disorders, and family structure (Epstein and Guttman,
© 1984; Thiessen and Gregg, 1980; Vandenberg, 1972). The question remains,
however, as to what are the more important of these characteristics.

In their review, Thiessen and Gregg
(1980) divided the characteristics of
mate selection into three categories of
assortative mating strength: high, medium, and low. In the “high strength”
category of characteristics, they included propinquity, age, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion, and
politics. The “middle strength” cate
gory included intelligence, educational
status, personality, and vocational interests. The characteristics of the “low
strength” category included specific
anthropometric traits, talents, and
abilities. The strength of assortative
mating of a level was described as inverse to the amount of genetic variance
displayed by those characteristics included within it. That is, the more heritable characteristics (e.g., specific anthropometric traits) were less powerful
criteria in assortative mating than were
the less heritable characteristics (e.g.,
politics). Thiessen and Gregg argued
that such a relation capitalized on the
genetic homozygosity between the individuals while avoiding the dangers of
inbreeding associated with excessive
homozygosity.

After reviewing the research on assortative mating, Epstein and Guttman
(1984) supported Thiessen and Gregg’s

(1980) earlier observation that assortative mating for sociocultural traits
was more pronounced than for psychological traits. Yet, differential assortative mating within a group of traits was
not supported. Epstein and Guttman
concluded that, while it is not random,
“the many correlational studies done
to date have yielded no definite conclusions as to which personality variables are most highly correlated among
married couples” (p. 273).

Several studies have reported differential assortative mating coefficients
for variables within a sample. Yet, little research has been put forth which
compares estimates from different
samples. That research which has compared different samples has been inconclusive (Guttman and Zohar, 1987;
Mascie-Taylor, 1989; Price and Vandenberg, 1980). While this research often reports similar patterns in assortative mating coefficients, no statistical
analysis or pattern similarity has been
employed.

The present investigation will center
on the generalizability of assortative
mating coefficients for personality variables. Specifically, it will report on the
correlating of sets of coefficients which
have been reported for scales of the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI; Hathaway and McKinley, 1951). By employing a series of
coefficients from a variety of samples
and comparing them statistically, I
hope that a broader, more accurate
picture will be expressed of differential
assortative mating.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The MMPI consists of over 550
items, combining to form 10 clinical

Social Biology

scales (e.g., Hysteria, Paranoia) and
four validity scales (e.g., Lie). It has
been described repeatedly as being the
most widely employed objective personality assessment device in a wide
range of settings (Brown and McGuire,
1976; Lubin et al., 1985; Piotrowski et
al., 1985). In addition, it is viewed as
being the most important objective
personality test to learn in clinical
training centers (Moreland and Dahlstrom, 1983; Wade and Baker, 1977).
Its importance in research is illustrated
by its numerous citations. For example, Psychological Abstracts reports
over five thousand references to the
MMPI between 1966 and 1988. The
present investigation will focus on the
10 original clinical scales and three of
the validity scales (Lie, Fake, and K).
The literature on the MMPI was reviewed to glean those studies which reported sets of spouse (or “prospective
spouse’’) correlations. The only restriction placed on these sets was that
the marriage sample not be defined by
its instability. Such groups repeatedly
have been demonstrated to display
lower levels of assortative mating (e.g.,
Bentler and Newcomb, 1978; Cattell
and Nesselroade, 1967). The resultant
sets of correlations, as listed in Table 1,
are from the following five samples:
Massachusetts. Gottesman (1965)
reported some preliminary analyses
from a twin-family project in the
greater Boston area. One portion of
the presented data was based on an examination of 66 pairs of mothers and
fathers of the twins who were in the
project. Gottesman presented the correlations between the parents on the 10
clinical scales of the MMPI. Significant
levels of positive assortative mating
were demonstrated for Scale 1 (Hypo

@ Minnesota. — Hill (1973) reviewed a
‘047 series of MMPI’s administered to
4,000 ninth grade students in the MinReapolis public school system. This reew identified 99 pairs of students who
Would later marry one another. Hill rerted on correlations between these
gudents for the 10 clinical scales and
6ne validity scale (K). Significant posive assortative mating was reported
for Scale 6 (Paranoia) and Scale 7 (Psychoasthenia).

New England.—Murstein (1976)
studied 99 couples from several universities and colleges in New England who
were “going steady, engaged, and/
or seriously contemplating marriage”’
(p. 137). The correlations between
these prospective partners were reported for the 10 clinical scales, four
validity scales, and three additional

Ego-Strength). Significant positive correlations were obtained for Scale 2
(Depression), Scale 10 (Social Introversion), and the Anxiety Scale.! A
significant negative correlation was reported for Scale 5 (MasculinityFemininity).

Texas. — As part of an investigation
of personality resemblance between
children who were adopted and their
biological mother, Loehlin et al. (1982)
administered a shortened 373-item version of the MMPI to the adopting parents. Correlations between spouses
were then reported based on 281 couples for the three validity scales and
nine clinical scales (Scale 10 [Social Introversion}| was not reported). Signifi
Although Scale 7 (Psychoasthenia) was listed as
significant by Murstein (1976), it is only significant
when a one-tailed test is employed. As such, it was
not included as a statistically significant correlation
for the purposes of the present investigation.

cant positive correlations were reported for the Lie Scale and the Fake
Scale; Scale 6 (Paranoia) and Scale 8
(Schizophrenia) were at a level required for statistical significance.

California. —Lewak et al. (1985) reported comparisons of the levels of intellectual and personality similarity of
two sets of couples. One set was composed of 42 couples involved in marital
therapy while the other set contained
39 volunteer couples obtained by posting advertisements in the San Diego
area, Separate correlation coefficients
were listed for each set of couples for
the 10 clinical scales of the MMPI as
well as three validity scales (Lie, Fake,
and K). For the volunteer couples, significant positive assortment was noted
for the Lie Scale, the K Scale, Scale 4
(Psychopathic Deviate), Scale 5
(Masculinity-Femininity), and Scale 6
(Paranoia).

Reliability. —Because it is possible
that the differential reliability of the
scales, by attenuation of range, could
artificially differentiate or equate assortative mating coefficients, estimates
of scale reliability were included in the
analysis (see Table 1). Hunsley et al.
(1988) reported reliability estimates
for the tests’s 10 clinical scales and
three of its validity scales (Lie, Fake,
and K). These estimates were calculated from a meta-analysis investigation of calculations of internal consistency from over 70 studies published
between 1970 and 1981. The resultant
sample was diverse and included over
5,800 subjects for some of the scales.
These estimates indicated high levels
of reliability for the 13 scales and
ranged from a low of 0.71 for Scale 9
(Hypomania) to a high of 0.84 for Scale
7 (Psychoasthenia).

RESULTS

A brief examination of the general
pattern of correlations between
spouses (and between prospective
spouses) fails to reveal any patterns of
generalizability (see Table 1). While all
studies did report significant correlations, only Scale 6 (Paranoia) was reported as significant in three separate
samples (Minnesota, Texas, and California). Furthermore, there was often
no concordance between studies as to
which scales were significant. While
the Massachusetts sample reported
three significant correlations and the
New England sample also reported
three significant correlations, there
was no concordance between samples
for these correlations. Furthermore, in
only one instance was there more than
one significant scale in common between any two samples (the Lie Scale
and Scale 6 [Paranoia] in the Texas and
California samples). Thus, a_ brief
overview of the pattern of significant
correlations offers little support for
their cross-sample generalizability.

Furthermore, these correlations
are, for the most part, quite low. To
determine how strong an effect assortative mating generally was having on
the MMPI, two mean correlations
were calculated for each sample. One
average was for all scales listed while
the other was limited to the clinical
scales. Because of the small sample
sizes and small number of correlations
in a set, Fisher’s z_ transformation
method was employed (Silver and
Dunlop, 1987; Strube, 1988). As can be
seen in Table 1, none of these correlations were significant.

It should be noted that the California sample had a mean correlation

 
 

Vol. 39, No. 1-2

which was considerably larger than
that calculated for the other samples.
Their sample size, however, was also
considerably smaller than were the
other sample sizes. As a result, the California MMPI correlations would also
have the greatest degree of unreliability in their estimates of assortative mating.

Four sets of additional correlational
vanalyses were then undertaken on
these coefficients. First, the five full

ets of assortative mating coefficients
avere correlated with one another. Secnd, this same set of correlations was
indertaken while controlling for the
effects of differential attenuated range
~due to scale reliability. None of these
“correlations, either before or after the
"Adjustment for scale reliability, were
Significant (see Table 2).
‘= It could be argued that the inclusion

Soul obscure any significant clinical
scale between-study correlations that
Anight exist. Thus, the same two sets of
-<orrelations were undertaken, although they were limited to the 10 clincal scales. The resultant sets of corre‘dations are not presented since they did
hot differ considerably from the Table
2 correlations calculated on all of the
MMPI scales.

DISCUSSION

The absence of significant correlations between any two of these samples
strongly suggests the lack of generalizability for assortative mating coefficients based on personality variables.
Three possible explanations could be
offered for the lack of any significant
results. First, it could be argued that
one should not expect significant correlations of these coefficients because
of the vastly disparate nature of the
stages of marriage they represent. Research has supported mild convergence
or divergence for some personality
variables over the course of a marriage
(Buss, 1984; Guttman and Zohar,
1987). Nevertheless, this argument
does not explain why such widely differing patterns of assortative mating
coefficients should appear in different
samples.

If one accepts, however, the
premise that these samples are representative enough that one should be
able to detect at least some degree of
pattern similarity, then two alternate
explanations are possible. These explanations are commensurate with the
view that similarity on characteristics
in Thiessen and Gregg’s (1980) lower
categories (which would include personality variables) results from assortative mating on the “high strength”

category of characteristics. The second
proposed explanation is that lower
strength characteristic resemblances
result directly from assortative mating
on “high strength” characteristics. As
Thiessen and Gregg stated, “the environment can amplify assortative mating and heighten inclusive fitness ...
by acting as a gravitational sink for the
accumulation of similar genotypes” (p.
134). If one further proposes that different “‘gravitational sinks” lead to different genotypes with different corresponding patterns of personality
variables, then it follows that different
patterns of assortative mating for these
characteristics would result. In this explanation, there is no actual assortment based on “medium strength”’ or
“low strength” characteristics. The appearance of assortative mating for
these characteristics results from assortment based solely on the “high
strength” characteristics.

The third explanation is a variant of
this second explanation and employs
more of a “filtering”? model. This
model suggests that assortative mating
on the “high strength’ category of
characteristics indirectly determines assortative mating on the lower strength
categories of characteristics. In this
model, primary assortment occurs on
“high strength” characteristics with

Social Biology

further assortment occurring on characteristics in the “medium strength’
category and then in the “low
strength.” This further assortment,
however, is not uniform. The degree of
this secondary assortment, as well as
the characteristics involved, are determined by the initial assortment. Unlike
the previous explanation, assortment
continues on the “medium strength”
and “‘low strength” categories of characteristics, although it is moderated by
the initial assortment. Previous research by Mascie-Taylor and Vandenberg (1988) supports this explanation
over the others. Their results indicate
that propinquity has some differential
effect on assortative mating for personality, but it does not account for all of
spousal similarity.

It is not possible from the present
investigation to determine which of the
three explanations is the most likely.
What can be noted is that the results of
this investigation fail to support the
generalizability across samples of differential assortative mating coefficients
for personality variables. As a result, it
is no longer possible to study one or
two samples and make wide-ranging
statements as to what exact personality
variables are more important for assortative mating.
