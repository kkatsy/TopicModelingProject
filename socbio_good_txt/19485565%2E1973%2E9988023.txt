The Samaritans today are a small group
of some four hundred individuals. Their
current demography was reported by Bonne
(1963). They trace their ancestry over a
period of more than two thousand years
from the biblical Samaritans, a religious
sect that broke away from the main stream
of Judaism about the fifth century s.c. As
an independent nation, they enjoyed their
greatest expansion in numbers and significance during the Roman Empire, and large
Samaritan settlements were later found in
various localities in the Middle East. With
the coming of the Byzantine Christian rule
and its Islamic successor, there was a period of exile, persecution, and gradual decline in numbers and influence. Finally,
the colonies disappeared, and the center
of the community continued to survive only
in Shechem (Nablus) where in the last century the number of Samaritans declined
to fewer than 150 individuals. Nonetheless,
as throughout the whole of their history,
they remained preferentially endogamous.

At the beginning of this century, the impending extinction of the population was
predicted, but a general increase in numbers
occurred. In the early 1930’s there was a
slow migration of several families from
Shechem to Jaffa (Palestine) which resulted

 

in the present division of the population
into two groups, one living in Nablus, Jordan, and the other in Cholon, Israel. In
1948 political events separated the two
groups geographically and socially from
each other, except for several days each
year during the Passover when all members
of the two communities join for a pilgrimage to Mount Gerizim, their holy mountain
and center of worship.

In 1933 Gini drew attention to the high
abortion rate among women of the small
Samaritan community. He wrote (p. 127):

The striking characteristic of the reproductive hfe of the Samaritans is the high
frequency of abortions, in contrast to the
rarity of stillbirths and the moderate frequency of premature deliveries. The abortions are not due to venereal disease, for
this is said not to exist among the Samaritans; our investigations exclude the possibility that they are due to excessive toil
on the part of women during pregnancy. In
some cases they appear to be connected with
malaria, but for the majority this does not
appear to be a plausible reason. . . . it is
highly probable that here is an effect of the
strict and prolonged consanguinity which, as
is well known, results in the uncovering of
the action of lethal factors. Very high also
appears infant mortality in both sexes and
particularly in males.

To these high frequencies of abortions and
infant deaths has been attributed the dim

inution in numbers of the Samaritans that
has progressively occurred over the centuries, despite the fact that recently they have
had better health conditions than those of
surrounding populations.

For this small population, then, there
was a report of a high abortion rate, a suggestion that it was related to inbreeding,
and the speculation that it may have been
characteristic of this population for a long
period. It was of obvious interest to investigate the reproductive history of Samaritan
women to verify Gini’s observation and, if
confirmed, to examine his interpretation.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

From 1960 on Dr. Bonne worked in the
Samaritan community in Israel and established good rapport. This personal contact
was extended in 1963 through informants
and correspondents to the Samaritan women
living in Jordan to whom no direct access
was possible until 1967. Over this protracted period, the details of the reproductive histories of the women were acquired.
The accuracy of the reporting is believed
to be very high, for apart from the personal
acquaintanceship, it is customary among
the Samaritans for the domestic activities
of the woman to be affected by her position
in the menstrual cycle. Thus, it is possible
to cross-check personal information in a
way impossible in many other populations.
The information here analyzed relates to
the situation at the end of 1963.

For every woman details were recorded
of her present age and the duration of her
marriage or marriages. From this information, the period at risk of pregnancy was
calculated. The menopause was taken to
occur at the age of 45 years, and in the
case of a woman above this age the period
at risk was taken as having terminated
then. Marriages of less than one year’s duration were excluded from the calculations.
For each woman, pregnancies were listed

Inbreeding Among the Samaritans

65

and the outcome identified. From the nature of the data it was possible to identify
“pregnancies” when only one period had
been missed; but for purposes of this analysis a pregnancy was only taken as such
when two periods were missed. For each
woman, the number of pregnancies, the
number of abortions and stillbirths, the
number of live births, and the number of
children surviving and the ages at death of
those who did not were tabulated. The
number of pregnancies, live births, etc., per
fertile year of marriage were estimated as
the ratio of the total number of pregnancies, live births, etc., to the total number
of fertile years of marriage. The proportion
of miscarriages was estimated as the ratio
of the total number of miscarriages to the
total number of pregnancies, and the proportion of children dying as the ratio to
the total number of children born.

RESULTS
REPRODUCTION

The reproductive experiences for the Israel and Jordan groups are generally similar
(Table 1). Details are available for the total population, 80 women involved in 84
unions. Four unions of duration greater
than 2 years (12 years and 3 years in Israel,
7 years and 6 years in Jordan) had proved
Sterile; a fifth of 8 years was unproductive,
although the woman was fertile in a subsequent marriage. Altogether, these unions
had resulted in 457 pregnancies, 59% of
which occurred in the Jordan group. There
were 9 twin pregnancies, so that 466 individuals in all were conceived. There were
5 current pregnancies, leaving 461 individual conceptuses whose fate could be analyzed. The number that had aborted or
were stillborn was 117, a very high total,
representing one quarter of all individuals
conceived; moreover, the proportion is simiJar in both Israel and Jordan (27% and
24%). Of the 344 live births, only 271

survived to adulthood or are still surviving
as children. There is significantly (0.02 >
P>0.01) better survival in the Jordan
than in the Israel communities.

The greater number of pregnancies in the
Jordan community is due to the greater
duration of unions and accompanying years
of pregnancy risk. The number of pregnancies per fertile year of marriage is very
similar in the two groups as is the number
of live births per fertile year of marriage,
since the proportion of abortions to number
of conceptions is also very similar in the
two communities. The number of surviving
offspring per fertile year of marriage, and
the proportion of children surviving per
live birth both remain greater in the Jordan
community. There are few data with which
these rates can be compared. The overall
number of pregnancies per fertile year of
marriage (0.34) is very similar to that
(0.33) in 93 unions uncomplicated by abnormal hemoglobin in either spouse in a
West African survey among the Yoruba and
neighboring peoples practising no contraception (Roberts and Boyo, 1960). The
proportion of Samaritan abortions (overall,

 

0.25) is nearly twice as high as the Nigerian sample (0.14) and thus accounts
for the lower number of live births per
fertile year of marriage (overall, 0.25) in
the Samaritan than in the Nigerian sample
(0.29). The difference in live birth frequency remains when allowance by weighting is made for the bias due to the concentration of births in the earlier years of
marriage, with an increase in variance with
duration of marriage.

Examining the Israel community in more
detail, those abortions whose date by month
of pregnancy can be definitely stated show
a distinct bimodal distribution. The majority occur in the earlier months of pregnancy (third, fourth, and fifth); there is a
distinct antimode in the sixth and seventh
months of pregnancy, and a second mode
in the eighth and ninth, the losses rising to
a peak with the number that occur at or
near term, stillbirths, etc.

RELATION TO INBREEDING
Bonne (1963), examining all living individuals born to those married after 1932,
calculated the mean inbreeding coefficient

of inbred individuals in the Israel community to be 0.055 and of the whole generation
in the Israel community to be 0.043. The
calculations were subsequently extended
(Bonne, unpublished) to cover Samaritans
in both communities and included all 381
Samaritans who were living in 1964 and
174 of their known ancestors. The pedigree
depth over which the inbreeding coefficients
were calculated varied from individual to
individual, and in view of the long history
of inbreeding in the Samaritan community,
all the results are to be regarded as minimal for any individual. There is no base
line population against which comparison
can be made. Nonetheless, there are some
high inbreeding coefficients. There were 82
individuals for whom F = 0, 41 in Jordan
and 41 in Israel, from unions with nonSamaritans. The other 299 exhibited some
degree of inbreeding, with a coefficient
ranging from 0.006 to 0.135; of these, 47%
have an inbreeding coefficient of 0.0625 or
higher. The mean value of F for inbred
individuals in Jordan is 0.061 and in the
Israel community, 0.055. The mean coefficient of inbreeding for the total Samaritan
sect is 0.046 for the total population, and
0.059 for inbred individuals only. In the
last generation, born to parents married
after 1938, there are 123 offspring from
42 fertile marriages, for whom the mean
inbreeding coefficient is 0.069; in the Jordan representatives of this generation, it
is 0.074.

Despite the bias involved in using incomplete pedigrees for calculations of
inbreeding and genetic load (Spuhler and
Kluckhohn, 1953; Roberts 1969), it appeared of interest to examine the Samaritan
abortion and survival data in terms of their
inbreeding. Of the nonproductive unions
of sufficient length to be regarded as sterile,
the coefficients of relationship of the spouses
were all positive, ranging from 0.042 to
0.156 with a mean of 0.096. These unions
were excluded from the subsequent anal

ysis. The data showing the number of losses
antenatally and postnatally for the Samaritan communities of Israel and Jordan are
given in Table 2, according to the inbreeding coefficient of the individuals conceived.
Inspection suggests no clear trends with
inbreeding category in either community.
Perhaps in Israel there may possibly be
an indistinct trend with increasing consanguinity to a greater proportion of antenatal
losses, and in Jordan a faint trend in the
opposite direction. Comparing the Israel
and Jordan groups, there is no significant
difference between them in the proportions
of antenatal losses in the first four inbreeding categories in Table 2, but the difference is highly significant in the most
inbred category. It appeared worthwhile
to look more closely at the regressions on
consanguinity. ;
Calculation of the A and B values for
the weighted regressions on inbreeding coefficients gives the results shown in Table
3. For abortions and stillbirths, the Israel
figures do indeed show a positive value
for B, and the Jordan, a negative. However,
compared against their standard errors,
neither regression coefficient differs significantly from zero, and the regression coefficients in the two subsamples do not differ
significantly from each other (F = 1.17
with 1 and 37 degrees of freedom). The
two values of A are both significant and
very similar to each other. The two subsamples may therefore be pooled, and the
estimates of B and A for the total Samaritan population is given in the final column
of Table 3. Again, although the regression
coefficient is negative, it is less than oneand-a-half times its standard error. Similar
calculations were carried out for deaths
between birth and 2 years of age, and for
deaths between birth and 15 years of age.
The values of the variance ratio are respectively 0.74 and 0.40, so again the two
subsamples are pooled to give the overall
values in the final column of Table 3. Thus,

there is no evidence that within the Samaritans increased consanguinity gives rise to
increased antenatal or postnatal loss, and
indeed there is a slight suggestion that
the trend may be in the opposite direction
—that increased consanguinity reduces antenatal loss.

the fetus, is responsible for fetal loss. This
hypothesis was tested by examination of the
weighted regression of proportion of abortions on the inbreeding coefficient of the
mother instead of on the offspring in the
two subsamples combined. Again, the value
of B is negative, but not significantly different from zero (B = —1.265 + 0.888,
A = 0.304 + 0.048), so that it appears

Vol. 20, No. 1

that maternal inbreeding does not increase
fetal loss.

DISCUSSION

This study has confirmed the reported
high antenatal loss in Samaritans and has
also demonstrated moderate postnatal loss.
However, the results give no suggestion
that within this community the high antenatal loss is positively associated with the
consanguinity of unions or the degree of
maternal autosomal inbreeding and indeed
suggests rather the reverse. Similarly, consanguinity does not appear to exaggerate
postnatal loss, but again rather the reverse.
The two sections of the community do not
differ significantly in the relationship of
their antenatal loss to inbreeding, nor would
they be expected to, since they were so
recently a whole and they continued to
intermarry despite the political separation,
a practice that has increased since 1967.

Of the possible explanations for the results, one is that inbreeding has continued
for so long in the Samaritans that the inbreeding coefficients used in this study,
which except for the noninbred were minimal, in fact do not reflect adequately the
differing probabilities of identical homozygosity in any conceptus in the population. Another possible explanation depends
on the interpretation of the final regression
coefficient, whether in fact it is zero, or
whether it is negative; for this, further
information over the next few years is
required. If it proves negative, then it is
possible that there may have been an
adaptation to inbreeding, i.e., inbreeding
has been going on so long that any deleterious genes producing abortions have been
bred out, as suggested by Darlington (1960,
1961). If this is so, then one might expect
to find still higher levels of abortion in
other less inbred Middle Eastern communities. Data are as yet not available.

Perhaps homozygosity has no effect on

abortion. Fraser (1962) made a careful
appraisal of the existing data on abortion
and inbreeding. These data may not be
entirely satisfactory since they relate to
detected abortions and do not include
early undetected embryonic deaths. He
noted in Slatis, Reis, and Hoehne’s study
(1958) that even though abortions represented a contribution of 0.52 lethal equivalents, the actual numbers of abortions in
consanguineous and control matings were
very similar (e.g., 36 out of 248 pregnancies
in consanguineous unions as compared with
34.2 expected on the null hypothesis). The
preliminary analyses of Schull (1958) and
Morton (1958) of Japanese data showed
that inbreeding had no effect on the interval
between marriage and first birth; thus,
there was no evidence for an important recessive lethal component acting at the early
zygote stage. Moreover, inbreeding had no
effect on sex ratio, and therefore there was
no evidence of sex-linked lethals acting in
utero. However, there is a marked inbreeding effect on stillbirth and neonatal] deaths.
Goldschmidt et al. (1961) showed fewer
abortions among consanguineous unions in
Kurdish Jews, and Book (1957) similarly
observed a negative effect. Freire-Maia,
Freire-Maia, and Quelce-Salgado (1961)
found in Brazilian whites a small increase
in stillbirths and decrease in abortions in
consanguineous unions and a greater increase in both Brazilian Negroes. Sutter
(1958) in France and Yanase, Masuda,
and Fujiki in Japan (cited in Schull and
Neel, 1965) observed an increased proportion of stillbirths with increasing consanguinity.

Taking another approach, Stevenson and
Warnock (1959) found no increase in consanguinity of the parents in a series of
abortions in Belfast as compared with the
normal population; in the present data

women who have aborted at least once

(0.039) and those who have not (0.035)
are similar. Fraser (1962, p. 414) concluded, “there is therefore no reason to
suppose that recessive lethal genes are
operative prenatally to any extent in man

. unless indeed they are so common
that no increase in consanguinity amongst
the parents is to be expected. This is rather
unlikely.” The present results are compatible with this conclusion.
