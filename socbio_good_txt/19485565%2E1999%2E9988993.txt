On Abandoning Life When It Is Least Difficult

ABSTRACT: Suicide data from Sweden (1911-1993) and New Zealand (1975-1995) were used to
test a hypothesis derived as an extension of the Seasonal Affective Disorder concept. Contrary to
the hypothesis, but similar to what Durkheim had reported regarding Central Europe in the
nineteenth century, suicides peaked in late spring (May in Sweden, November in New Zealand).
Durkheim’s hypothesis that there would be more monthly variation in suicides in rural areas
was strongly supported. Our hypothesis is that people abandon life when it is least difficult because of a disjuncture between experience and expectation.

The concept of a “seasonal affective
disorder” asserts that a lack of exposure
to sunlight in winter causes some people
to experience feelings of depression (Lee
et al., 1997). Among these people, some
become severely depressed and contemplate suicide. While most depressed people do not commit suicide, the risk factor
for suicide is, nonetheless, estimated to
be thirty times as high for those with depression as for the general population
(McDonald, 1998).

Therefore, the idea of a seasonal affective disorder clearly implies that suicides
should peak sometime during the harsh
winter months. As Durkheim put it, if one
were to speculate without reference to social facts, one might easily surmise that
the season most conducive to suicide 1s
“when the sky is darkest and the temperature the lowest ... Does not the desolate
appearance of nature at such times ...
provoke melancholy? Moreover, this is
the time when life is most difficult because a more abundant sustenance is necessary to replace the lack of natural

warmth, and this is harder to obtain”
(1897, p. 106).

In a recent survey of undergraduate students in a social psychology course at our
university, 86 per cent chose December or
January when asked which month would
have the largest number of suicides. The
modal answer was December, chosen by
117 of the 166 respondents. Some students
even made explicit reference to “S.A.D.”
or “Seasonal Affective Disorder,’ when
asked to explain their estimate.

Durkheim theorized that the crucial
variable was the intensity of social life
rather than climatic or weather conditions. Using data from the nineteenth
century for seven central European countries, Durkheim found that the summer
season had the highest proportion of suicides. He reported: “Beginning with January..., the incidence of suicide increases regularly from month to month
until about June and regularly decreases
from that time to the end of the year”
(1897, p. 111). Durkheim’s findings,
while unexpected, were not entirely new.

The Greek physician Hippocrates had observed in his anthology of truths, Aphorisms, that the common conditions of
madness and melancholy were especially
frequent in the spring. Contemporary authors (Maes et al., 1993; Parker and Walter, 1982) echo Hippocrates’ observations
inasmuch as they locate spring peaks for
several types of severe anxiety and depressive disorders.

In addition, Durkheim observed that
there was more variation in social life
from month to month and from season to
season in rural settings than in urban areas. This observation implies the hypothesis that, whenever the peak and whatever
the shape of the function, there ought to
be more seasonal or monthly variation in
suicides in rural than in urban areas.

Although there have been some mixed
results (e.g., Araki et al., 1986; Nayha,
1982; Spiers, 1972), overall the evidence
is quite consistent with that reported by
Durkheim (Flisher et al., 1997; Kunz and
Kunz, 1997; Hassan, 1994; Lester, 1971;
MacMahon, 1983; Warren, Smith and
Tyler, 1983; Wenz, 1977). Massing and
Angermeyer (1985), for example, found
that suicide in Lower Saxony in the years
1968-77 was most likely to occur in
spring and early summer and was at its
minimum in winter. Chew and McCleary
(1995) reported that countries with a relatively high proportion of agricultural
workers had higher spring peaks in suicide than countries less dependent on
agriculture. They also observed that “...
spring peaks in suicide decline as populations urbanize, but only in the temperate
middle latitudes are there significant
spring peaks to begin with” (Chew and
McCleary, 1995, p. 229). The latter inference is called into question by the data
reported below.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The focus of this article is on suicide
data from Sweden, and there are good
reasons for this choice. Located far to the
north with a range of 55-69 degrees north
jJatitude, Sweden has distinctly different
seasons, featuring extended daylight
hours in the summer and very short days
in the winter. Norway, just to the west of
Sweden, has been referred to as the “best
laboratory in the world” for research on
seasonal affective disorder and depression (Reuters, 1997). While Sweden is
situated well to the North, the bulk of its
population lives at latitudes of 55-60 degrees. So we are not conducting analyses
of people who live within or near the Arctic Circle. (For that type of comparison,
see Bohlen, 1972.)

Sweden also has a world-wide reputation for being willing to take an objective
look at its own society and for the accuracy of its statistics. Categorizing deaths
as suicides is problematical; making
cross-national comparisons of suicide
rates, hazardous. Social scientists have
expressed the view that the suicide statistics of some Catholic-dominated countries in Southern Europe may have been
skewed “for heavenly purposes.” Sweden,
one of the more secular societies, does
not have that problem. It is also an advantage that comparable data have been gathered within Sweden for a rather long
time. Our analysis extends continuously
across nine decades from 1911 to 1993.
During these 83 years, there were 102,
102 deaths recorded as suicides in Sweden for an average of about 1,230 per
year. Of these suicides, 75 per cent were
committed by men and 25 per cent by
women. Table 1 shows that there was relatively little variation across decades in

RESULTS

Figure 1 shows the average number of
suicides per month in Sweden in the
years 1911-93. These averages, adjusted
to equalize the number of days per
month, show the peak to occur in May
with a rather symmetrical curve going
downward in both directions. The average for May was 121.8, followed by
June’s average of 116.6. Contrary to the
hypothesis implied by the seasonal affective disorder concept, the lowest average
was for December with 90.9; February,
January, and November, additional cold
and dark months, were the other months
with an average of less than 100 suicides.
Despite the large differences due to gender in the number of suicides, May was
the peak month for both men and women.

As might be expected, there were minor variations across decades. However,
the peak month for suicides was always
May (6 decades), April (2 decades), or
June (1 decade). The lowest month for
suicide was always December (4

decades), February (3 decades), or January (2 decades). Overall, we have 996
cases (83 years x 12 months). With the
adjusted number of suicides as the dependent variable, month as an independent
variable accounts for about 9 per cent of
the variance (eta = 0.30). That figure,
however, underestimates the strength of
the relationship since a substantial portion of the variance is due to an increase
in the number of suicides across years,
e.g., from an average of about 832 per
year in the years 1911-1919 to an average of about 1,442 in 1990-1993. When
the same analysis of variance procedure
was done within each decade, the eta
value averaged 0.60. This finding indicates a rather robust relationship, implying that, within a decade, the month being considered can account for about 36
per cent of the variance in the number of
suicides. We also tested whether month,
season, or a dichotomous warm-cold period was the more relevant variable. The
results indicate that dividing the calendar
into twelve months accounts for more of
the variance in suicides than dividing it
into four seasons or two periods.

We then considered the hypothesis that
monthly variation is greater in rural than

in urban areas. Between 1911 and 1955,
Swedish data were available with the adjusted number of suicides for each of four
combinations (gender by rural-urban). The
results, given as eta squared coefficients,
are shown in Table 2. Men show slightly
more monthly variation in suicides than
women, but the difference is relatively
small and not consistent across decades.
The rural-urban difference, however, is
quite large and entirely consistent across
decades. That the same trend would be
observed in each of five comparisons is
unlikely to occur by chance (p < 0.05).
For people living in rural areas away
from the large cities, month accounts for
more than twice as much variance in the
number of suicides as for people in urban
areas. The rural-urban difference is further sustained when gender is controlled
(see the four right-hand columns in Table
2). In each comparison, rural men

showed more monthly variation in suicide than urban men, and rural women
more than urban women. The consistency
across these ten comparisons is almost
certainly not due to chance (p < 0.001).

REPLICATION

Despite the strong association between
month and the number of suicides in
Sweden, we deemed it desirable to replicate the finding in the southern hemisphere where the seasons are the opposite
from those in Sweden. Ideally, we wanted
a technologically advanced nation with
accurate mortality statistics that is as far
south as Sweden is to the north. The nearest we could come to that standard was
New Zealand. Although New Zealand is
not as far south as Sweden is north, we
still hypothesized that in New Zealand,
suicide would peak in November which is
late spring in that country.

"Each entry is an efa squared value based on an analysis in which month is the independent variable and the number of suicides, adjusted
for the number of days in the month, is the dependent variable. Hence, the number given estimates the proportion of variance in the number of

suicides that can be attributed to the month variable.

In New Zealand in the years 1975-95,
8,421 deaths were classified as suicides.
Similar to the Swedish data, in New
Zealand men committed about 75 per
cent of the suicides and women 25 per
cent. Table 3 presents the suicide data by
month for New Zealand combined across
this 21-year period. The association between month and suicide is not as strong
in New Zealand as it is in Sweden.
Nonetheless, the observed pattern in New
Zealand departs significantly from what
would be expected if there were no relationship (x2 = 37.51, df = ll, p <
0.001). Moreover, the adjusted number of
suicides peaks in November in New
Zealand, as predicted.

DISCUSSION

In this research, we tested a logical
and reasonable extension of the seasonal
affective disorder concept, namely that
suicides would peak in December or January due to a paucity of sunlight during
these months. That hypothesis was not
supported in data from either Sweden or
New Zealand. While this finding in no
sense disproves or eliminates the concept
of a seasonal affective disorder, it does
limit it. A plausible hypothesis is that the

concept remains viable and valid, but the
lack of sunlight may cause no more than
a mild, transitory form of depression that
does not increase a person’s propensity to
suicide.

Our use of data from Sweden and New
Zealand is quite defensible. As shown in
Table 4, neither country is an outlier as to
its suicide rate. Sweden’s rate, while
above the median, is similar to that of
Germany, Belgium, and France. The suicide rate in New Zealand is similar to that
of the United States or Canada.

We regard the differences between
Durkheim’s finding that suicide peaks in
June in Central Europe and our finding
that suicide peaks in May in Sweden and
in November in New Zealand to be relatively minor. The point is rather the counterintuitive mature of these findings.
Taken together, they beg for a sociological interpretation.

Durkheim’s use of variations in the intensity of social life as a crucial factor
was only partially successful. It is not
clear, for example, how that factor could
be operationalized directly, nor that it increases from January to June and then decreases until December in a way that corresponds with the suicide curve. Also, it
is not obvious how an increase in the

“Number of suicides per 100,000 population.

intensity of social life would necessarily
yield an increase in suicide.

Durkheim asserted that there would be
more seasonal variation in social interaction in rural than in urban areas. It follows, therefore, from his interpretation
that there would be more monthly variation in suicides in rural than in urban settings. In that regard, Durkheim’s reasoning was strongly corroborated by our
analysis.

However, we are still lacking an adequate social explanation for why people
are prone to abandon life when it is least
difficult. Why should people decide (disproportionately) to end their lives when
nature is being “reborn,” when the birds
are singing and fiowers are blooming?

Although we cannot prove it here, perhaps it has some connection with the relativity of human judgment. In the poet T.
S. Eliot’s words:

“April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring... .”

In a different but related area of research, common sense tells us that people
would be most prone to revolt when they
are most deprived in objective terms, i.e.,
when they have “nothing left to lose.” In
fact, however, people are more likely to
revolt following a period in which living
conditions have actually been improving
and expectations have been rising (Brinton, 1965; Davies, 1962). The concept of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

Vol. 46, No. 1-2

relative deprivation proved useful in sociological analyses that sought to explain
apparent paradoxes in the American Soldier Studies (Merton, 1957; Myers,
1996). A recent analysis suggests that
suicidal reactions to natural disasters, especially floods, may be delayed by a lag
as large as four years—at a time when
one might suppose that life would be returning to normal and living conditions
improving (Krug et al., 1998).

A relativistic theory of human happiness is grounded in people’s recent experiences and their expectations (Parducci,
1968, 1984). The late spring peak in suicides may be due to a combination of
what people are experiencing relative to
what others appear to be enjoying and to
their own high expectations (Gabennesch,
1988). Especially in ambiguous situations
in which people are searching for meaning, judgments are heavily influenced by

the results of a social comparison process
(Festinger, 1954). As the popular song,
“Oh Lonesome Me,” put it, “Everybody’s
going out and having fun; I’m just a fool
for staying home and having none.” The
dynamics of this relationship could be examined more directly in future research
by comparing suicide notes written in
May when suicides are most frequent
with suicide notes in December when suicides are least numerous.
