Vasectomy Eligibility: Evaluative Criteria

in the Health Care System

Over the past few years, the surgical procedure of vasectomy has become a popular
method of family planning in the United
States. This is evident not only in the increasing number of articles that have appeared in the popular and scientific press,
but also by the actual number of vasectomies reportedly performed. In 1970, over
750,000 operations were reportedly performed (Nation’s Health, 1971), while only
200,000 sterilizations for both sexes were
acknowledged between 1955 and 1960
(Campbell, 1964).

It might be presumed from the increasing
incidence that the procedure is readily accessible to men who may desire this method
of family planning. Indeed, more men are
able to obtain a vasectomy, since a greater
number of physicians are performing the
procedure than in the past. Yet, the fact
that more men obtain vasectomies does not
necessarily support the assumption that the
procedure is readily available throughout
the health care system, although there are
no legal restrictions in the United States on
voluntary sterilization of male or female
adults seeking such operations.

If the current literature regarding vasectomy is examined, the full spectrum of

eligibility requirements defined by the medical profession is encountered ranging from
explicit and detailed barriers to be surmounted by the prospective patient to complete omission of any eligibility criteria.

Medical bodies have taken cautious
stands. The American Medical Association
singles out religion, parity, psychiatric stigmata, and agreement of the spouse as criteria for consideration (JAMA editorial,
1968). The Association for Voluntary Sterilization proposes probably the most liberal
stance, spelling out no specific criteria but
urging evaluation based on the mental and
emotional condition of the spouses, and
family histories (AVS, 1970). The Margaret Sanger Research Bureau has age and
parity requirements, but bases a decision
on the needs of the individual family (Sobrero and Edey, 1970).

When individual authors are consulted,
an appalling variety of eligibility requirements are encountered. The intuitive approach, reflecting years of experience, seems
to be the method of choice in the absence
of clear organizational guidelines.

In varying combination, age, age and
parity, psychological fitness, maturity,

the operative procedure, marital stability,
religious compatibility, the length of time
vasectomy has been considered prior to
application, psychosomatic illness, and various idiosyncratic criteria tend to be emphasized.

It would be a disservice to individual
authors to omit their entire eligibility and

peculiarities; but, the reader who is inter

< Although both clinics and private physi= cians were self-selected (i.e., volunteering
© the information that they performed vasectomies), the survey population appeared to
be essentially representative of service
agents throughout the health care system.
Since vasectomy performance is available
through both clinic services and private
physicians, it was possible to note not only
the overall configuration of eligibility criteria in the service system, but also differences between the service delivery modes.
In the former, eligibility criteria and decisions potentially involve an interdisciplinary
approach (i.e., the consultation between

Vasectomy Eligibility

 

309

physician, nurse, social worker, counselor,
etc.), while in the latter the private physician would shoulder sole responsibility. A
primary objective of the study was to compare and contrast criteria within the context of the two delivery modes.

Respondents were asked a series of questions about criteria that had been established and were followed in the decision to
accept or reject a vasectomy applicant.

Specific areas of interest revolved around:
the youngest age range of acceptability; age
and parity combinations that would be
acceptable; the importance of religious conflicts, marital status, marital stability,
spouse consent, and emotional stability;
and the length of time that vasectomy
should have been considered by the applicant prior to application.

Individual clinics and private physicians
devote different amounts of time to the
performance of vasectomy in their total
services; this factor was controlled so that
assessment was possible of its potential influence on eligibility criteria.

Significant differences between physicians
and clinics were viewed in terms of chisquare tabulations.

RESULTS

In order to control for the differing
amounts of time devoted to vasectomy performance among service agents, it was necessary to determine the proportion both
groups (the 114 physicians and 72 clinics)
devoted exclusively to the operative procedure. This did not seem to vary greatly between the groups. Few clinics or physicians
devoted more than 25% of their time to the
performance of vasectomy.

Those services which devoted 75% to
100% of their time to vasectomy performance were only 2% of the physicians and
7% of the clinics; in the 50-75% category,
2% of the physicians and 1% of the clinic
services reported affirmatively. The 25

50% category accounted for roughly 3%
of the physicians and 8% of the clinics.

Although over 18% of the physicians and
17% of the clinic services reported vasectomy performance as being 10% to 25% of
their total services provided, the majority
in both groups spent less than 10% in
vasectomy performance, ie., 75% of the
private physicians and 67% of the clinics.

No statistical difference emerged among
group totals.

Review of the literature revealed that a
common measure of eligibility is often the
age of the applicant. Although clinics tended
to accept a slightly higher percentage of
men in the “under 21” age ranges, no statistical significance was apparent between the
groups as a whole.

For men under age eighteen, 5% of the

agents with high age requirements. For the
twenty-seven to thirty-four age range, 22%
of the physicians and 19% of the clinics
responded affirmatively; only 1% of the
physicians and clinic services expected the
applicant to be over thirty-five.

When the youngest age range of acceptability was controlled for service time devoted exclusively to vasectomy, no statistical difference was seen to emerge. Apparently this exerted little influence on the age
factor in vasectomy applicant acceptance.

Age alone is only one dimension, since
family parity has often been advocated in
the literature as a factor to be coupled with
age for eligibility criteria. In the present
study, several alternatives were offered the
respondents coupling age and family parity
in various combinations reflecting degrees
of restrictiveness and flexibility. In Table 1,

were likely to grant vasectomies. Men between eighteen and twenty-one stood a
better chance of obtaining a vasectomy,
with near:y 20% of the physicians and 27%
of the clinics approving the operation. Both
clinics and private physicians tended to
select the age range of twenty-two to
twenty-six with greater frequency, indicating men in this range were of sufficient age
to warrant a vasectomy (54%, physician;
44%, clinic). Higher age brackets showed

tomy. The most frequently selected ageparity category appeared to be the man
between twenty and twenty-six years of age
with more than two children; nearly 68%
of the physicians and 74% of the clinics
preferred such a candidate. For older age
ranges, where parity was sufficient, no statistical differences were apparent.

However, in two of the three younger
age-parity categories, significance was
noted. In the “20-25 with one or more
children” category, physicians (29% as
opposed to 53% for clinics) were less likely
to make a selection (P < 0.005); for the
“under 21 with no children” category, clinics (13% as opposed to 4% for physicians)
tended to be more represented in selections
(P < 0.05). It is interesting to note that
although the “under 21 with two children”
category approached significance, the clinic
percentage (31) was almost twice that of
the physicians (18).

When controlled for service time devoted
exclusively to vasectomy, significance was
seen for those services devoting less than
10% (where the majority tended to fall)
in relation to the age-parity category of
“20-25 with one or more children.” While
the clinic services were nearly evenly divided in their acceptance or rejection (45%
and 55% respectively), private physicians
were more likely to reject an applicant
under these circumstances (24% and 76%
respectively; statistical difference was significant at the 0.05 level).

Hence, significant correlations were
shown between delivery modes and younger
age-parity criteria for granting vasectomy.
Clinics were more likely to accept younger
applicants with lower parity, perhaps reflecting a slightly more flexible, less restrictive stance in part.

Speculation suggests that age-parity is a
more accurate measure of the services’ position toward applicant acceptability than age
alone. Few authors in the literature neglect

the link between age and parity in eligibility
criteria. The data above tend to suggest, it
can be speculated, that not only are private
physicians more concerned about legal ramifications (self-protection and defensive
medicine) and maturity of the applicant,
but also higher parity tends to insure
against potential untoward reactions and
misgivings in the event of the death of
progeny. Clinic services are less concerned
about age-parity, perhaps placing greater
emphasis on the individual’s right to elect
vasectomy despite personal circumstances.

Several additional factors are frequently
suggested in the literature as potential criteria of eligibility. Among these factors are:
religious conflicts, marital status (whether
unmarried men should be vasectomized),
marital stability, spouse consent, history of
emotional instability, and period of time
vasectomy has been considered prior to
application.

Respondents were asked to designate
whether these were important factors in
consideration of eligibility within an “agreedisagree-not important” context. Questions
were arranged so that responses of agreement would indicate a more restrictive
stance, while disagreement or unimportance
would reflect a less restrictive posture. In
Table 2, responses of the two groups are
shown regarding attitudes toward the
above criteria, excluding time of consideration prior to vasectomy application.

When asked if vasectomy should be denied because of religious conflicts, respondents’ percentages primarily fell into the
“agree” category (39%, physicians; 53%,
clinic), with “strongly agree” selected secondly (32%, physicians; 23%, clinic).
Responses of disagreement and unimportance consisted of nearly 30% for physicians but only about 23% for clinics.

Marital status seemed to be of less importance. To the statement that unmarried
men should not receive vasectomies, 23%

agree,” with nearly 35% of both groups
represented. Strong disagreement and unimportance accounted for 30% of the physicians and 26% of the clinic services.

A majority of both services agreed that
marital stability should be a factor in the
vasectomy decision. Nearly 49% in each
group responded that if the marriage were
not stable, vasectomy should not be granted.
In addition, another 25% of the physicians
and 18% of the clinic services strongly
agreed. Responses of disagreement and unimportance accounted for 26% of the physicians and 34% of the clinics.

Wife’s consent seemed to be the most
important of the criteria. Nearly 91% of
the private physicians and 86% of the
clinics reported “agree” or “strongly agree”
responses to the imperative procurement of
wife’s consent. Responses of disagreement
or unimportance accounted for only 9% of
the physicians and 14% of the clinics.

Observable or known history of mental
illness tended to have some importance for
both groups. Denial of vasectomy for this
reason was supported by 41% of the physicians and 44% of the clinics who reported
agreement, and 23% and 19% respectively
who strongly agreed. Yet, 36% of the physicians and 37% of the clinics responded in
disagreement or unimportance.

No significant differences emerged in
statistical analysis; however, “wife’s consent” approached significance at the 0.05
level, with fewer clinics concerned about
“spouse consent as an eligibility factor.

On the whole, designation of religious
conflicts, marital status or stability, and
emotional stability as important eligibility
criteria differed little between groups. In
essence, neither delivery mode enjoyed a

more flexible posture, excluding “‘wife’s consent,” where physicians were more representative in their responses.

Combining “strongly agree” and “agree”
percentages together, both groups tended to
select ‘‘wife’s consent” as the primary factor
of importance, with religious conflicts, marital stability, emotional stability, and
marital status following in order of importance for clinics; private physicians, however, reversed the order of religious conflicts
and marital stability in their configuration
(Table 3).

CONCLUSIONS

The delineation of and focus upon independent criteria, it can be argued, is artificial and misleading; obviously, they overlap
in application and are in concert during the
evaluative process.

Yet, the overall pattern of the data seems
to lend credence to speculation that confusion of eligibility criteria and haphazard
application evidenced in the literature
roughly mirrors actual clinical practice in
the delivery system.

When controlled for service time devoted
exclusively to vasectomy, no significance
was noted.

When length of time that vasectomy had
been considered by the applicant was
viewed, little difference was noted. Group
percentages varied slightly, with nearly the
same figures (38%) shown for both groups
in designating that the length of time vasectomy had been considered was relatively
unimportant. Although private physicians’
preference (33%) was six months, while
clinics (30%) chose one month as a time
preference, percentage totals for the groups
were low and there was no significant difference. Only 8% of physicians and 5% of
clinics chose a time length of one year.

Controlling for time devoted exclusively
to vasectomy revealed no statistical difference.

However, some consistency appeared to
emerge. That the wife’s consent is procured
appears essential; and religious compatibility, and marital and emotional stability,
also seem to be fairly important to the
survey population.

One obvious implication in the data suggests that younger men with lower parity
tend to have more difficulty obtaining a
vasectomy; a man with a dissenting spouse
may also be hindered. The service delivery
system tends to view such candidates as
possible legal risks and rejection assures
self-protection.

One wonders about the validity of this
position. The Association for Voluntary
Sterilization has taken great pains to publicize the fact that vasectomy is completely
legal when voluntarily performed. Yet, the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

history of vasectomy in the United States,
and the muddled legal position which
evolved, perhaps genuinely justify a cautious posture. With laws varying from state
to state—often still existing from the past
but disregarded—and/or not clearly defined
or updated, few service agents relish the
opportunity to disrupt the equilibrium.

‘ Influential professional organizations
have only sparingly offered guidance regarding vasectomy criteria and procedures. This
is understandable in light of widely differing
professional opinion, and a dearth of conclusive research. Hence, in the vacuum created,

 

Social Biology

personal bias, value judgment and sometimes lack of knowledge have evolved as the
underpinnings of eligibility decisions.

To debate the question of whether there
should be clearly defined guidelines which
service agents should subscribe to in the
delivery of services, or whether elective
vasectomy procedures should be free from
imposed constraints—i.e., vasectomy on demand—is beyond the scope of this paper.
However, either position would tend to
greatly facilitate the transition from valueJaden and inconsistent application of services to a more equitable process.
