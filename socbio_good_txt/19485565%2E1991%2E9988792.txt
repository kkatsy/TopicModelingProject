Abortion in Canada:

Dimensions of Women’s Attitudes

‘2 ABSTRACT: This paper examines a number of demographic and sociocultural factors (e.g., age,
3 marital status, family size, religion, religious assiduity, sex-role ideology) as predictors of
© women’s attitudes toward abortion, using data from the Canadian Fertility Survey of 1984. The
5 5p tindings suggest that women’s abortion attitudes are to a greater extent based on ideological
& positions. It appears that anti-abortion stance affects those women who are religious, presumably
+ by increasing the relationship between their general sex-role ideological stances and abortion
~- attitudes. Abortion attitudes also vary according to a woman’s education, her family size, and

Abortion is increasingly becoming a
-= social and political issue in Canada. In
‘S January, 1988, the Supreme Court of
“= Canada struck down Canada’s 19-yearold abortion law, ruling it violated wo& men’s constitutional right to life, lib‘Zerty, and security of person. The court
effectively invited the government to
introduce a new law that would be less
yrestrictive and yet somehow balance
3 women’ s rights against the competing
= =rights of the unborn. The Supreme

chigan] at 13:4

=Court’s decisions instigated anti© abortion as well as pro-abortion activity.

In an attempt to resolve the abortion issue, the House of Commons
passed a bill, Bill C-43, which outraged
anti-abortionists because it allows
abortions to be performed at any stage
of pregnancy if a physician considers
the woman’s physical, mental, or psychological health is in danger. Bill
C-43, however, was defeated in January, 1991, by an extraordinary 43-43
tied vote in the Senate, and Canada is

now left without a national abortion
law. The pro-choice activists were
cheered by the defeat of the law. They
predicted that no federal government
will try to regulate the procedure for at
least the next generation. The Canadian Medical Association (CMA),
which opposed the bill because it
would have “recriminalized a medical
ct,” believed the senators provided a
valuable service to health care,
women, and Canadian society as a
whole by defeating the law. Some antiabortion activists were also pleased
with the outcome because passage of
the bill would have made it difficult
to introduce a stronger law against
abortion. They called it a victory, but
insisted that Parliament must now
introduce a tougher law against abortion. The years 1988 to 1991, therefore, represented a period of volatile
debate on the abortion issue in Canada, and the vote in the Senate is a
clear indication of how polarized and
difficult the issue is.

In spite of the appreciable controversy over and interest in abortion in
Canada, there has been relatively little
research on the factors affecting the attitudes of Canadian women toward
abortion. The more recent studies have
indicated that women who are nonCatholic, educated, less religious, and
metropolitan residents are more liberal
in their attitudes toward abortion (Balakrishnan et al., 1988). In their study
of married women living in metropolitan Toronto, Balakrishnan et al.
(1972) found that religious affiliation
(Catholic vs. non-Catholic) and religiosity to be more powerful predictors of
attitude toward abortion. The control
variables of age, education, income,
and size of birthplace were not as important as the religious factors in explaining the variation in abortion attitudes. These two studies are perhaps
the most conclusive studies to date on
the importance of religion as a predictor of attitudes toward abortion in
Canada.

Other studies indicated that both
demographic and attitudinal variables
are important predictors of abortion
attitudes (Clayton and Tolone, 1973;
Hertel et al., 1974; Renzi, 1975; Blake,
1977; Granberg, 1978; Singh and
Leahy, 1978; Granberg and Granberg,
1980; Adebayo, 1988). However, few
of these studies have controlled for the
simultaneous effects of ideological
variables. It seems likely that religious
differences in abortion attitudes can be
accounted for by attitudinal variables
which are related to ideological stances
(Barnartt and Harris, 1982). Furthermore, there is reason to suspect that
the attitudinal variables affect the
physical and social reasons for abortions (often known as “hard” and
“soft” reasons) in the same way.

Social Biology

Two features central to the theoretical arguments of the present paper
stand in contrast to previous studies.
First, attitudinal variables such as sex
role ideology are expected to be important predictors of abortion attitudes.
Second, predictors of approval of abortion for physical reasons vary from that
for social reasons.

This focus neither disputes nor disregards the possibility that the religious
variables have direct influences on attitudes toward abortion. I suggest,
however, that earlier studies may have
understated the importance of attitudinal variables in explaining attitudes to
ward abortion by failing to distinguish .

their effects between physical and social reasons for approval of abortion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data used in this paper were drawn
from the Canadian Fertility Survey
(CFS) conducted in April-June 1984.
The CFS was Canada’s first national
fertility survey, using telephone interviews for both household selection and
in-depth interviewing of the selected
respondents, namely, women in the reproductive ages of 18 to 49 years. The
total of 5,315 women of all marital statuses who were interviewed constitutes
a representative national sample. The
overall response rate was 70 per cent.

The survey questionnaire is an outgrowth not only of the WES questionnaire, but of other surveys done in
Canada, Europe, and the United
States. The CFS contained a substantial number of questions on attitudes
toward marriage, family, and abortion
seldom asked in fertility surveys. It
also covered a wide range of topics,
including pregnancy, marriage, work
history, contraceptive behavior, and

socioeconomic background variables
such as religion, education, income,
and occupation including those of the
husband where applicable. It should be
borne in mind that the data were gathered before recent Supreme Court rulings which liberalized abortion laws
and the Senate’s tied vote against Bill
C-43 which allowed abortion at any
stage of pregnancy with approval of a
physician.

The specific variables employed in
the analyses are described below.

ABORTION

Attitudes toward abortion were
tapped by seven questions. These
questions were phrased as: Assuming
abortion were legal, would you be for
or against a woman having an abortion

bos

_

. the pregnancy is endangering the
mother’s life;

. the pregnancy puts the mother’s
health in danger;

. the woman had been raped,

. there were good reasons to believe
that the child would be physically or
mentally retarded;

. the woman was not married;

. the household does not have the financial means to support a child; and

7. the woman wants an abortion for a

reason she feels is valid.

Other studies which have used the
CFS data have shown clear differences
in approval for abortion depending
upon the reason given for abortion (see
also Table 1). Approval for abortion
varies from a high of 92 per cent if the
mother’s life is endangered by the
pregnancy to a low of 32 per cent if the
household does not have the financial
means to support a child (see also Balakrishnan et al., 1988). Different levels
of approval for abortion depending
upon the reason given have also been

found by researchers in the United
States (e.g., Jones and Westoff, 1973;
Blake, 1977; Barnartt and Harris,
1982). The authors found greater approval for abortion for physical reasons
than for social reasons. These items
form a fairly consistent Guttman Scale
(Balakrishnan et al., 1988), although
there are two clusters of types of reasons with a gap between them. In a recent work by Balakrishnan et al. (1988)
the first six items, leaving out the seventh, constituted a unidimensional |
scale with a coefficient of reproducibility 0.93. Ironically, factor analysis suggested the presence of two factors.
Factor 1 on which the physical reasons
loaded highly and positively, accounted for 46.6 per cent of the variance; Factor 2, on which the social reasons loaded highly and negatively,
accounted for 20.3 per cent of the variance. Treatment of the two factors as
separate scales can therefore be justified.

The four reasons for which approval
is relatively high are those which were
derived from physical causes, including
danger to the mother’s life or health,
physical or mental retardation in the
child, and rape. Lower levels of approval are found for abortion related
to social reasons, including lack of financial means and being single. Based
on these large differences in approval
levels, two indices were developed,
one for physical reasons and the other
for social reasons. Each item was dichotomized, and the respective codes
were summed. A score on the first index ranged from 0 to 4, indicating the
number of physical reasons in which
the women think abortions should be
made legal. A score on the second index ranged from 0 to 3, indicating the
number of social reasons in which the

women think abortions should be
made legal. The indices measure the
degree to which the women think legal
abortions should be available. The two
indices form the dependent variables in
the study.

CONTROL VARIABLES

The independent variables selected
are typical of those frequently analyzed
in studies on attitudes toward abortion
(Mileti and Barnett, 1972; Blake, 1973;
1977; Singh and Leahy, 1978; Balakrishnan et al., 1972; 1988; Barnartt
and Harris, 1982; Powell-Griner and
Trent, 1987). The variables include age
(AGE), marital status (MSTATUS),
number of children (CHILDREN),
years of schooling (SCHOOLING),
religious affiliation (RELIGION), religious assiduity (RELIGIOSITY),
and occupational prestige of women
(PRESTIGE). A locational variable,
province (PROVINCE) is also in
 

cluded as a control variable. The attitudinal variable includes sex role ideology index (SEXROLE). Items for
the sex role ideology index are:

a. Do you find that it is a good thing for
each partner in a couple to have their
own close friends who they see without the other? (1 = Yes; 0 = No)

b. Do you find it acceptable for a
woman to decide to have a child without a husband/partner in a house?
(1 = Yes; 0 = No)

c. Could you make a decision to have a
child without the presence of a
husband/partner in the house?
(1 = Yes; 0 = No)

d. Do you find it acceptable for a divorced woman to live with her children and a new partner without being
married to him? (1 = Yes; 0 = No)

The respective codes for the four items
were summed up forming an index
ranging from 0 to 4, measuring the
number of “‘liberal”’ answers provided
by each woman.
Vol. 38, No. 3-4

Relationship between the dependent variables and the independent
variables were investigated through regression analyses. The analyses involved three steps. The first step in the
analysis was to assess the explanatory
power of sociodemographic and attitudinal variables on the women’s attitudes toward abortion using multiple
regression analyses. The second step in

‘cthe analysis was to determine whether
addition of religious affiliation and reGigious assiduity adds significantly to
€the explained variance in abortion atotitudes beyond that accounted for by
demographic factors. The third step in

The descriptive data in Table 2 show
no consistent relationship between ap‘yproval levels of abortion and women’s
‘age. Although, age differences in ap<proval levels, both for physical and soScial reasons, are not pronounced, it appears that the approval levels are
comparatively higher among those
aged 25-34. Means for marital status
indicate that divorced/separated/widowed women are more inclined to approve legal abortion. Approval levels
of abortion monotonically decrease
with rising number of children, and in

ferences are somewhat greater for social reasons compared with physical
reasons. The levels of approval by religious preference follow the expected
pattern with relatively low levels of approval among Catholics. Approval of
abortion varies for the remaining variables in the expected directions. Particularly, high approval levels are seen
among less religious women residing in
Quebec, and women who have higher
occupational prestige.

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS

Regression analyses were performed to assess the extent to which
variation in approval for abortion
stemmed from differences in demographic, socioeconomic (including cultural) and attitudinal variables. The results are presented in Table 3.

In general, the estimated effects of
most of the variables are consistent
with previous research. The strongest
predictors of abortion approval include
church attendance and sex role ideology for both types of reasons. When
the other variables are controlled, religiosity exerts the strongest effect on
abortion attitudes. In general, those
who are highly educated, nonCatholic, and less religious, those with
fewer children, those with more liberal
sex role views, and those who reside in
Quebec are more likely to support legal abortion. Religious factors explain
a greater proportion of the variance for
physical (9.7 per cent) and social (9.2
per cent) reasons. The relative importance of marital status is higher for
physical reasons than that for social
reasons, indicating that married
women are more likely than their nonmarried counterparts to approve abortion for physical reasons. There are

some regional/provincial differences
worth noting. Approval levels for
physical reasons are stronger among
Quebec women compared to their
counterparts in Ontario. Opposition 1s
stronger in the West than in Ontario.
On the other hand, opposition to abortion for social reasons is the strongest
in the Atlantic region as compared to
that in Ontario.

Sex role ideology explains a greater
proportion (2.5 per cent) of the variance for social reasons whereas it explains only 1.2 per cent of the variance
for physical reasons, suggesting a tendency for sex role views to be more related to abortion attitudes for social
reasons. Ignoring sex role ideology,
demographic and socioeconomic variables explain 13.7 per cent and 17.2 per

cent of the variance in abortion attitudes for physical and social reasons
respectively. One could now ask the
question: Given the significant relationship of demographic and socioeconomic (including cultural) variables on
abortion attitudes, will sex role ideology add significantly to our understanding of the abortion attitudes of
women once their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are controlled? The answer is yes. Even after
demographic and socioeconomic variables are controlled, sex role ideology
explains a notable proportion of the
variance in abortion attitudes. Apparently, demographic variables possess
only a fraction of the predictive-explanatory power for attitudes toward
abortion, especially, for physical reasons.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The results can be summarized returning to the two basic objectives outlined in the introduction.

The first basic question was whether
sex role ideology is an important predictor of. abortion attitudes, when
other factors are controlled. The most
strongly supported notion is that approval for abortion is centered in certain strata of society that reflect a more
general liberal attitude. This was suggested by the regression analysis where
sex role ideology was by far the second
strongest predictor for approval of
abortion when other factors were controlled.

The second issue concerned
whether predictors of abortion attitudes for physical reasons vary from
those for social reasons. The results
suggest that religiosity and sex role ide
Social Biology

ology are the strongest predictors of
abortion attitudes for both types of
reasons. Although sex role ideology
has a clear positive effect on abortion
attitudes for physical reasons, this effect accounts for a relatively smaller
portion of the observed variation in
abortion attitudes for physical reasons.
However, it contributes to a substantial portion of the variability in abortion attitudes for social reasons. This
finding suggests that attitudinal variables such as sex role views are important predictors of approval of abortion
for social reasons. One cannot, of
course, provide more than inferential
support for the impact of sex role ideology without additional data. The
present analysis suggests that the impact is significant for women’s attitude
toward abortion, and further exploration of the impact on men’s attitude
might tell whether the sexes are differentially susceptible to ideological views
relating to abortion attitudes.

The results also indicate that religious factors, and, especially religiosity, are more powerful predictors of
attitudes toward abortion than demographic and socioeconomic variables
such as marital status, education, and
occupational prestige. Thus, women
who are highly religious seem to be less
liberal in their attitudes toward abortion.

There is an important caveat to the
conclusions made here, and, indeed, to
those drawn from any study that uses
the CFS data to explore abortion attitudes. The questions only dealt with a
limited statement. The responses do
not measure whether the women themselves would get an abortion under the
specific situation (Balakrishnan et al.,
1988). Whether the opinions of these

women conform to their actual behavior, is, of course, not known. Nevertheless, these data provide additional
insight into abortion attitudes in the
country since this is the first study, to
this author’s knowledge, in Canada
which distinguishes physical and social
reasons for approval of abortion attitudes in a multivariate framework. I

further research on the topic.
