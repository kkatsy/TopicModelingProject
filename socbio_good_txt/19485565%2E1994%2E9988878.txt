~ ABSTRACT: Although fertility declines have taken place in several Arab countries, the Arab
© nations are growing rapidly. In Saudi Arabia, the total fertility rate (TFR) is 7.1, and the growth
erate is 3.5 per cent per year, among the highest in the world. This research examines the
& structural determinants (indirect indicators) of fertility attitudes and behavior among Saudi
A Arabian students studying in American universities. Specifically, this study examined the
oo relationship between fertility attitudes and behavior, and background characteristics which
= included age, religiosity, education, income, length of stay in the U.S., and wife’s age and wife’s
St education. Results indicate a highly significant effect of religiosity as a major positive determi“ nant of fertility attitudes. However, the major determinant of fertility behavior, the number of
3 children respondents had, was wife’s education which was negatively related with family size.

© The fertility rate in Arab countries is
among the highest in the world. Although fertility declines have taken
place in several Arab countries, the
Arab nations are growing rapidly. In
Saudi Arabia the total fertility rate
(TFR) is 7.1, and the growth rate is 3.5
per cent per year. These rates are
among the highest in the world.
‘Despite the fact that the TFR in
Saudi Arabia is comparatively high, according to some sources it is declining
(World Population Profile, 1991). Only

recently, couples in Saudi Arabia have
been deciding not to have as many children.

The purpose of this study is to
examine the relationship between fertility attitudes and behavior and background characteristics of Saudi Arabian university students enrolled in
U.S. institutions. Specifically, fertility
attitudes and behavior were correlated
with: age, religiosity, education, income, and the length of stay in the
United States. The impetus for this research lies in the fact that Saudi Arabia
has one of the highest levels of fertility
in the world (TFR 7.1), one of the
highest annual rates of natural increase
(3.5 per cent), and simultaneously a
relatively high GNP per capita (US$
6,230), and level of education for men
and women. Very little is known about
fertility attitudes in Islamic countries.
High fertility and natural increase, and
relatively high socioeconomic development indicators, call into question the

relationship between fertility and development. Therefore, it is important
to investigate this relationship including the very strong cultural factor of
religiosity.

BACKGROUND

Both Demographic Transition Theory, and Wealth Flows Theory (Caldwell, 1982), emphasize the importance
of socioeconomic development as the
key factor leading to fertility decline.
To date, neither Transition Theory nor
Wealth Flows Theory seem to account
for the demographic situation in Saudi
Arabia. Saudi Arabia has experienced
significant economic growth and development over the past three decades
without a commensurate decline in fertility. Therefore, it is possible that the
lag between the aspects of development and fertility have not yet
emerged, or a new and different approach to understanding the Saudi
situation is needed.

This study focuses on male fertility
attitudes and behavior since in some,
or perhaps many, cultures in developing nations, men usually tend to make
family size decisions and decisions on
the use of contraception (Mbizvo and
Adamchak, 1991; Khalifa, 1988).

The relationships between socioeconomic and cultural factors and fertility
attitudes have been examined by a
number of researchers. Religiosity has
a strong influence on fertility. Al-Said
(1988) and Nagi (1983) found that the
level of religiosity is positively correlated with fertility attitudes and behavior. Caldwell (1980) and Dhindsa
(1986) argued that education, as a socioeconomic factor, tends to have a
negative influence on fertility. As the

education of both males and females
increases, age at marriage increases.
Also, people with higher education
tend to be more concerned with children’s education which might lead parents to change their attitudes toward
family size. Income appears to be negatively associated with fertility (Briquets and Perez, 1982; Freedman and
Thornton, 1982). The length of exposure to different cultural and socioeconomic conditions has been assessed by
Friedland et al. (1980), Adamchak and
Adebayo (1987), and Adebayo and
Adamchak (1991). It was found that
students who have been exposed to
Western education and live in a different cultural and social environment
may have the desire for a smaller family size.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA

All male Saudi students who are
sponsored by the Saudi Education Mission (SEM) are the population of the
study. The total population, according
to SEM, is almost 2,000 male students,
distributed randomly in many American academic institutions. Nearly all
Saudi students are sponsored by SEM.

Cluster sample design was used to
select 622 male students from all institutions that have 15 or more male
Saudi students enrolled. SEM agreed
to provide a letter of consent and a
telephone number and address of one
Saudi student in each location for personal contact. This individual was contacted as the key person to distribute
the questionnaire in each location with
15 or more Saudi students. The response rate was 45 per cent representing 279 individuals.

VARIABLES

The dependent variables of this
study are the fertility attitudes and behavior of male Saudi students. Fertility
attitudes were measured by ideal family size for the total sample and its
married and single components. In addition, for those who were married, desired number of children and actual
number of children were used as dependent variables.

The independent variables are age,
religiosity, level of education, economic background, and length of stay
in the United States when ideal family
size was the dependent variable. In the
models where desired number of children and actual number of children
were the dependent variables, wife’s
age and education were included as
independent variables.

Religiosity is an important element
determining perception of fertility attitudes. Religiosity was measured by
asking respondents several questions
concerning the importance of their
participation and actions toward some
religious activities. To gain a more exact measurement of religiosity, four
questions were combined into one index. They include the importance of
religion compared to other forces,
the strength of religious beliefs, how
often respondents recite Quran, and
how many times respondents perform
prayers in the Mosque. The answer to
each question was divided into four
categories resulting in sixteen categories as follows:

1. The importance of religion
—Very Important = 3
—Important =2 ..
—Somewhat Important = 1
—Not Important = 0

 

Brief Reports

269

2. The strength of religious beliefs
—Strong Influence = 3
—Fairly Strong Influence = 2
—Somewhat Important = 1
—No Influence = 0

3. Howoften respondents recite Quran
—Every Day = 3
—2-6 times a week = 2
—Once a week = 1
— Other (Hardly or Never) = 0

4. How often respondents perform
prayer in the Mosque
— Over 7 times a week = 3
—2-6 times a week = 2
—Once a week = 1
— Other (Hardly or Never) = 0

The highest score of the religious index that a respondent could obtain is
12 while the lowest is 0. To obtain a
value from 0.0 to 1.0, the value of each
category was added and then divided
by 12 to obtain an average. For example, a respondent is considered very
religious if he has a score of 1.0.

Education appears in many studies
as an important factor of fertility. This
variable was measured by asking the
respondent about the number of years
he and his wife (if married) have spent
in formal education.

Economic background is viewed as
an important factor in shaping fertility
behavior. The level of subject’s income
was excluded since all Saudi students
sponsored by SEM receive the same
amount of money each month. Therefore, the income level of respondents’
families was used. Family income was
logged to correct for skewness.

In order to evaluate the strength of
the relationship between education,
religiosity, and income with fertility
attitudes and behavior, we needed to
contro! for confounding variables.
Length of stay in the United States was
used as a control variable since it

makes it possible to consider exposure
to a different culture. Age of respondent and age of wife (if married) were
also used as control variables. Older
students have had the opportunity to
marry and have children, and therefore, may have different attitudes and
behavior patterns toward fertility and
family planning.

Multiple regression was performed
to test the combined effects of the independent variables upon dependent
variables. Multicollinearity was assessed by regressing each independent
variable on the other independent variables (Lewis-Beck, 1980). The largest
coefficient of multiple determination,
R? was 0.590. Multicollinearity is not
considered a problem when R?’s are
less than 0.8.

RESULTS

Multiple regression was used to examine the relative importance among
the independent variables and to test
the combined effects of independent
variables upon dependent variables.
Means and standard deviations of the
variables used in the analysis are
shown in Table 1.

Table 2 shows the relationship between the dependent variable, ideal
family size, and the independent variables for the total sample and the
married and single components.

Unstandardized and standardized
regression coefficients and their level
of significance are shown. The only
significant variable was religiosity for
the total sample as well as the married
and single respondents (total sample:
Beta = 0.390; p < 0.01). The more religious the person is, the higher his
ideal family size preference, controlling on all other variables.

Social Biology

Table 3 shows the relationship between two dependent variables (number of children married respondents
desire, and the number of children
married respondents currently have)
and the independent variables including wife’s age and wife’s education.

The religious index remains positive
and significant with desired number of
children controlling on all other variables (Beta = 0.408, p<0.01). There
are no other significant relationships.
With the other dependent variable, the
number of children respondents have,
however, there are several significant
relationships. Wife’s education is negative and significant (Beta = ~0.280,
p<0.01). As the wife’s education increases, the respondent’s number of
children decreases. This finding reflects the importance of wife’s education on fertility decline.

Both respondent’s and wife’s ages
are found to be positively significant
with number of children. As age increases for respondents and _ their
wives, the number of children they
have increases. This result was expected since the older couples are
more likely to have more children than
younger couples. Religion, family income, respondents’ education, and duration were not significant.

DISCUSSION AND
CONCLUSIONS

Results indicate a strong influence
of the cultural factor, religion, net of
other indicators on ideal family size for
the total, married, and single respondents. Duration of residence in the
United States does not have a significant effect on any of the dependent
variables for any subgroup of the sam

ple. However, there was a negative relationship between duration of residence and ideal family size for the total
and married component and desired
number of children.

Religiosity, as an indirect determinant of fertility, was found to be the
most important determinant of fertility
attitudes among Saudi students studying in the United States. For married

respondents, religiosity was the only
significant indicator net of all other
variables to be related (positively) to
desired number of children. However,
religiosity was not related to fertility
behavior as measured by number of
children respondents currently have in
the regression analysis. Respondent’s
age and wife’s age are positive and
significant as expected. Number of

the wife’s education in fertility reduction in this particular Saudi population
group. Future research efforts on
Saudi Arabians and other Islamic populations will further our understanding
of this complex relationship within an
Islamic cultural context.
