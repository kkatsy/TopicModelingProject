Human Fertility and Land Tenure in

Highland Bolivia

Ricardo A. Godoy

 

Harvard Institute for International Development,

Cambridge, Massachusetts

ABSTRACT: Basic demographic data of landless and landed peasants from the highlands and
valley of Northern Potosi, Bolivia, are compared. Household size and crude birth rates are
larger in the highlands than in the valley. Within the highland population, no statistically significant difference was observed between the age-specific fertility of landless and landed women,
nor in the survivorship ratio of their offspring. The prevalence of exchange and reciprocity at
the village level may be responsible for the absence of important differences in the fertility and

mortality patterns of the landed and landless.

From the sixteenth century onward,
students and lay observers of Andean
demography have been interested in the
relationship between altitude and fertility (Monge, 1948; Clegg, 1978; Little,
1981; Stycos, 1963; Heer, 1964, 1967;
James, 1966; Hoff, 1968; Whitehead,
1968; Bradshaw, 1969; Baker and Dutt,
1972; Abelson, et al., 1974; Goldstein et
al., 1983). In line with this intellectual
tradition, this paper addresses the question: What is the relationship between
fertility and altitude within a single ayllu
or Andean ethnic group? In contrast to
previous studies, however, this article
also asks: To what extent do fertility patterns of wealthy and poor peasants of
the same ayllu living within the same
high-altitude ecological zone vary?
These queries are analyzed by using
fairly complete village census and retrospective fertility reports of women from
the Jukumani ayllu, a group of approximately 8,000 people inhabiting the
northern tip of the Department of Potosi, Bolivia.

Ayllus or ethnic groups have disappeared in most Andean nations, yet
they survive in some scattered regions of
Bolivia such as Northern Potosi. From
Colonial days onward, ayllu populations

290

have been divided into several categories for fiscal purposes. Some of the best
known tax categories include originarios, agregados, yanaconas, and Kantu
runas. Despite the variety of tribute categories, two major distinctions emerged
in the area under consideration: taseros
and kantu runas. The former are the
landed peasantry or true insiders, people who are obligated to pay land taxes
(tasas) to the state; hence their name fasero. They have direct rights of access to
ayllu natural resources such as farmland and grazing grounds. Kantu runas,
in contrast, are later additions. Jukumani Xantu runas date back to the latter
part of the nineteenth century, when
they entered ayllu territory as landless
laborers in search of land. They pay no
taxes and, as their name suggests in
Quechua, are “people of the margin,”
working the periphery of the tasero’s
plots (Platt, 1982, p. 38). In exchange
for the right to work marginal parcels,
kantu runas help taseros during festivities and with agricultural chores. Since
the usufruct rights of kKantu runas to the
margins of the land of taseros are limited
and mediated by faseros, land taken by
Jukumanis from neighboring ayllus during wars are given to Kantu runas to sup

plement their nominal holdings. Rights
to work these war booty lands, however, are Insecure, for neighboring ethnic groups fight back to reclaim these
lands.

Besides this dual distinction of the rural population into taxpayers and marginal people, the Jukumani ayllu, like
many other ayllus in Northern Potosi, is
culturally uniform. Most members are
peasant farmers, Quechua and Aymara
are the principal languages, and few
people speak Spanish. Work outside the
ayllu occurs among men on a seasonal
basis during the agricultural slack season.

Although there is an incipient interest in trying to understand the historical
origin and current function of these different types of peasants, few studies
have actually tried to spell out what
these tribute categories imply in terms
of quality of life, mortality patterns, fertility schedules, and other vital statistics
(Harris 1978, p. 56; Platt, 1982; Godoy,
1983).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Jukumani population lives in
two major ecological zones—the highland and the valley. Approximately
7,000 Jukumanis live permanently in 14
highland villages; the remaining 450
members of the ayllu live in the valleys,
three to five walking days away. The
data for this study include a complete
census of the entire permanent valley
population, and a rather complete census and fertility survey of four highland
villages. Census data were obtained
from the heads of households, but the
fertility survey was obtained by interviewing all available women. The sample of this study constitutes a fifth of the
total Jukumani population. The demo

graphic study was part of a broader ethnographic study of mining and agriculture in the region (Godoy, 1983).

A cautionary note should be introduced here before examining the
results. First, although the valley census
was complete, the highland census of
the four villages underestimates the total taxpayer population because 37 tasero households were temporarily absent during the time of the survey.
Second, as in other Andean societies,
there is underreporting of females born
and surviving (Bolton, 1980). For instance, when discussing the number of
surviving children, mothers often failed
to mention married daughters living
outside the village. While considerable
effort was taken to check underreporting, some errors, especially in regard to
Sex, no doubt remain. Age determination is also a problem, especially for the
older generation. Among the young,
one can check the age by consulting
birth certificates, an obligatory requirement for entering into the army or
schools. Among the older people, unfortunately, age determination is not
sound (Hoff, 1968, p. 110; Mazess and
Mathisen, 1982). To correct this problem, age data are presented in five-year
groups.

RESULTS

Table 1 presents the basic information of the census taken in the highlands
and valley. Information was obtained
from a total of 333 households, which included a population of about 1,700 people or 20 per cent of the Jukumani ayllu.

area despite the lushness of that terrain.
The reason relates to the land tenure regime; only taseros have direct rights of
usufruct to valley fields. The three kantu
runa households living and working permanently in the valley during the survey
were renting land from faseros.

A second salient observation of the
aggregate data relates to household
(i.e., nuclear family) size. Because
lower-lying mountainous zones tend to
be more fertile and productive than
higher-level zones (Guillet, 1981; Caballero, 1981; Golte, 1980), and because
hypoxic stress may depress the fertility
of highland women (James, 1966;
Abelson et al., 1974; Hoff and Abelson,
1976, p. 130; Baker and Dutt, 1972, p.
373), one would expect household size
to be inversely related to altitude. In
fact, when one controls for security of
tenure, one finds highland taseros having significantly larger households than
their valley-dwelling counterparts
(p < 0.005).

CuitpD/WomaN Ratios, CRUDE BIRTH
RATES AND ALTITUDE

Contrary also to the notion that the
children per woman in the reproductive
years declines with altitude (Stycos,
1963), one finds among Jukumanis no
relationship between altitude and human reproduction. The ratio of children
under 6 to women 20-59 years old is approximately the same in the highlands
(1148/1000) and in the valley (1155/
1000). Within the highland population,
taseros have a higher child/woman ratio
(1971/1000) than kantu runas (1082/
1000).

While it is true that the child/woman
ratio is not a sensitive index of fertility
owing to such factors as neonatal and infant mortality, underreporting of
young, and incorrect age reporting
(Whitehead, 1968; Bradshaw, 1969;
Dutt, 1976), 1980 crude birth rates in the
highlands are also higher for faseros
than for kKantu runas—S1 and 46, respecDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

tively. Although these crude birth rates
are higher than the national average of
40 per 1,000 population (POPLAB,
1981, p. 7), they are well within the
range of other Andean communities. In
Nufioa, Peru, at 4,200 meters above sea
level, and at Cerro de Pasco, Peru, at
4,600 meters, Baker and Dutt (1972)
found crude birth rates of 49 and 54 respectively. The crude birth rate of Vicos, Peru, located at 2,800 meters above
sea level, rose from 46 in 1952 to 56 in
1963 (Alers 1971). Crude birth rates in
rural Chile rise from 48 at sea level to 82
at 4,300 meters of altitude (Cruz-Coke
et al., 1966).

AGE-SPECIFIC FERTILITY

As Table 2 shows, highland Jukumani women begin reproducing in their
late teens; by their mid-twenties only
about 30 per cent of the 21-25 year old
female cohort remains childless. Of the
68 post-menopausal women interviewed, only 2 (3 per cent) had never
given birth. Virtually all Jukumani
women marry and enter the breeding
population—even the blind and physically disabled. And, as among the neighboring Laymi ayllu, divorce and perma

293

nent separation are rare (Harris, 1978a,
p. 28). This contrasts with other Andean
populations where marital instability is
marked (Hoff, 1968; Price, 1965).
Table 2 also shows the age group specific fertility of women by five-year age
cohorts. The data indicate that tasero
women are most fertile from their midtwenties until their mid-thirties while
kantu runa women are more fertile later
in life—during their thirties. When the
two peasant groups are merged, the fertility peak is shifted to the thirties. As in
rural Chile (Cruz-Coke, 1966) and Nuhoa, Peru, (Baker and Dutt, 1972),
highland Jukumani women are more
fertile later in their reproductive life.
Table 3 shows that the total fertility
of highland Jukumani women past the
age of 45 is about 8 offspring. On the
average, a fasero women past menopause has 8.7+2.3 live births. Kantu
runa women, in contrast, have about
one child less (7.83) by the end of their
reproductive careers. These differences, however, are not Statistically
significant (p > 0.05). Throughout their
reproductive careers, highland tasero
women have more children than their
kantu runa counterparts, yet these dif

ferences are not statistically significant,
except for the 26-30 year old age cohort
(p < 0.05).

Parity data was not obtained because
women could not recall all the dates of
birth and death of their offspring. Nevertheless, assuming a 21-25 year period
of time from the time of first to last pregnancy (Howell, 1973, p. 253; Hoff and
Abelson, 1976, p. 145) and a completed
fertility ratio of 8 offspring yields a parity span of about 2.5 years. This finding
is consonant with the average lactation
period, which is about two years.

Although a completed fertility ratio
of 8 is higher than the national rural average of 6 children (POPLAB, 1981, p.
10), it is within the range of other highaltitude Andean population estimates.
The completed fertility ratio of the Chilean Aymara studied by Cruz-Coke and
his associates ranged from 6 to 8.5
(Cruz-Coke et al., 1966). The postmenopausal Bolivian Aymara women studied by Dutt (1976, 1980) had a total 6
live births. The completed fertility ratio
in Nufoa and Cerro de Pasco was 6.7
and 7.6 (Hoff, 1968; Baker, 1978; Goldstein et al. 1983, p. 43).

MorTALITY

Within the highland territory there
are no statistically significant differences
in the infant and child mortality patterns
of taseros and kantu runas (Table 4). On
the average, a Jukumani woman past
the age of 45 has had about 8 children of
whom about four survive to adulthood.
This figure gives the Jukumani population a survival ratio of approximately
0.50, lower than the ratio for rural Cochabamba (0.78) at 2,600 meters above
sea level and rural La Paz (0.63) at an elevation of 3,800 meters (Dutt, 1980, p.
109).

DISCUSSION

The higher household size and crude
birth rates of highlanders suggests that
hypoxic stress may not depress fertility
(Goldstein et al., 1983). Despite the relative isolation of the Jukumani population and its traditional character, the
higher ecological zones are more benign
and economically important than the
valleys. The higher zones are closer to
the mines and markets and are free from

malaria and other diseases which caused
many valley farmers to migrate upwards.

Unfortunately, fertility surveys of
co lowlanders were not collected. Within
= the highland territory, however, taseros
o and kantu runas differ in fertility pat‘= terns in degree rather than in kind.
= Kantu runas have a lower crude birth
a rate, child/woman ratio, and total fertil2 ity rate than faseros. By the time a kantu
& runa woman completes her reproduc8 tive career she has had an average of 7.8
8 children; her tasero counterpart has had

one more child.

The age-specific differences in fertility and survivorship are higher for taseros than for kantu runas, but these differences are not statistically significant.
The same applies to household size. Taseros have slightly larger households
than kantu runas, but these differences
are not significant. From the available
evidence we therefore conclude that although differential access to natural resources may translate into slightly

f Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 201

higher crude birth rates and child/
woman ratios, it does not have much
bearing upon the fertility of women, or
the mortality or household size of taxpayers and kantu runas.

These results contrast with the findings of other scholars. Durham (1979)
and Stys (1957), for example, found that
the size of land holdings translated into
higher fertility and lower mortality
rates. Other evidence likewise suggests
that peasant household size correlates
with status and wealth (Laslett, 1965, p.
64; Netting, 1981, pp. 208-209; Klapisch, 1972; Wheaton, 1975; Lofgren,
1974, p. 28).

A possible explanation for the Jukumani anomaly may be the prevalence of
reciprocity and exchange. Though kantu
runas have an insecure tenure on land
and, as a rule, have also less land than
taseros, exchange and reciprocal mechanisms at the village level homogenize
people’s survivorship. Landless kantu
runas, for instance, are not left to their
fate; they are given land by wealthier ta

seros in exchange for services and the
like. Likewise, an old fasero married
couple with few or no children will invite
a kantu runa family with many children
to take care of them in their old age and
to bury them in exchange for the rights
of access to land. Through a variety of
such mechanisms discussed at length
elsewhere (Godoy, 1983), the survival
and mortality patterns of taxpayers and
marginal peasants may be equalized.
