Delinquency, Sex, and Family Variables

Family variables such as broken homes,
family size, and ethnicity have long been
linked to delinquency. Broken homes, in
particular, have popularly been thought to
play a causal role.

However, broken homes have been
found to relate more closely to female than
to male delinquency (Eaton and Polk,
1961; Ganzer and Sarason, 1973; Hathaway and Monachesi, 1963; Toby, 1957),
although one study differed (Gath, 1974).
The specificity of the broken-home effect‘
in female delinquency was interpreted by
Toby (1957) in terms of the better ability of
intact homes to control the behavior of
girls. Despite changing trends, female delinquency remains a vastly smaller problem than male delinquency, in terms of
both lower incidence and lesser violence.

Large family size, on the other hand,
has been linked to male delinquency
(Glueck and Glueck, 1968; McKissack,
1974; Nye, 1958; Sutker and Moan, 1973),
although one study (Hathaway and Monachesi, 1963) found no relationship. Glueck
and Glueck (1968) cautioned that their
finding that delinquent boys came from
larger families might be explainable by
uncontrolled factors such as ethnicity and

“multiple parental marriage patterns,” a
variable presumably also related to broken
homes. The Gluecks noted that when they
matched for ethnicity, the large-family
factor remained.

That more male than female delinquents come from large families (Quay
and Werry, 1972; Solnit, 1967; Toby,
1957) may stem from the greater difficulty
of socializing boys. Boys also respond
more to discipline by the mother than by
the father (LaVoie, 1973), suggesting that
boys may be more vulnerable to dilution of
the mother’s attention. For boys, parental
affection was one variable found to be important in delinquency (Glueck and
Glueck, 1964), but it is a difficult variable
to rate. Family size, on the other hand, is
easy to determine and may also relate to
parental interaction with the child (Zajonc
and Markus, 1975).

Gerber (1973) has suggested that the relationship with the cross-sex parent is important to both boys and girls (see also
Hetherington et al., 1971). A large family
may dilute the mother’s influence more for
boys than for girls, who may identify with
the mother’s expanded role in a large family (Gath, 1974).

The present study of community-retained delinquents in San Diego County,
California, hypothesized that, in compari

son with general populations norms, the
sample should include: more males than
females; more broken than intact homes,
especially for females; and more large than
small families, especially for males.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects studied were 182 delinquents,
aged 10-20 years, referred consecutively
by probation officers for psychological
evaluation for “treatment planning.”

Intact homes were defined as those in
which the child resided with both natural
parents. Small families were defined as
containing 1-3 children; large families,
4-13 children.

Expectations for the genera] population
were estimated from census figures (U. S.
Bureau of the Census, 1975, p. 69) in
order to compute the significance of deviations from those expectations by means of
a chi-square test.

RESULTS

As expected, the delinquent sample contained more males than females (70 per

169

cent vs. 30 per cent; chi-square equals
28.48, p < 0.001).

The hypotheses about the incidence of
broken homes were also verified in this
sample. Delinquents came from broken
homes more often than would be expected
from norms for the general population,
and broken homes were more typical of
delinquent females than of delinquent
males (Table 1).

As expected, delinquents tended to
come from large families, whether intact
or broken. Large family size was more
typical of male than of female delinquents.
Males’ mean family size was 5.27 compared to 4.13 for females’ families (¢ equals
2.59, p < 0.05).

Of the 127 males, 16 came from families
of 9 children or more; of the 55 females,
only 1 came from so large a family. The
difference is significant by a post-hoc
Fisher’s exact test (b < 0.05).

A three-way analysis of variance was
performed on family size, by sex, broken/
intact home, and Anglo/non-Anglo ethnic
groups. Family size varied significantly by

sex and ethnicity, but the broken/intacthome variable was not significant. There
was a significant interaction between sex
and ethnicity, in that the largest families
belonged to non-Anglo male delinquents
(mean, 6.80 children; F (1,171) equals
4.24, p < 0.05).

For males and females together, nonAnglo delinquents’ families were larger
than Anglo delinquents’ families (means,
6.08 vs. 4.26 children} F (1,173) equals
44.94, p < 0.001). The larger-family effect
for male delinquents compared to female
delinquents could be traced through all
three ethnic groups: Anglo, 4.43 vs. 3.84;
Chicano, 7.00 vs. 4.60; Black, 6.69 vs.
4.50. This finding fails to support the
Gluecks’ concern (1968) that the larger
families of minority ethnicity might be
responsible for the relation observed between large families and male delinquen
cy.

DISCUSSION

As hypothesized, two family variables,
broken homes and large families, were
more frequently found among delinquents
than among the general population, with
broken homes more frequent for female

delinquents, and large families more frequent for male delinquents.

The broken-home rate for male delinquents was no larger than that estimated
for the comparable general population
(Table 1). Both rates were higher than
those in previous years and those for other
geographical areas (Biles, 1971; Eaton and
Polk, 1961; Hathaway and Monachesi,
1963; Herzog, 1970; Sutker and Moan,
1973).

The national trends toward smaller
families (thus decreasing male delinquency) and more broken homes (thus increasing female delinquency) may relate to the
recently observed relative increase in
female delinquency (Andrew, 1974). Small
intact families appear favorable for both
girls (Joseph, 1970) and boys.

LIMITATIONS

The present sample must be considered
subject to possible selection bias (Herzog,
1970). Further, the lack of comparison
groups from the same city and year, and
the consequent reliance upon census figures for general population rates, limits
this as well as other studies (Biles, 1971;
Eaton and Polk, 1961).
