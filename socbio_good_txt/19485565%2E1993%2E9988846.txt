Secondary Sex Ratios
in Micronesian Populations

ABSTRACT: Secondary sex ratio (SSR) values in excess of 109 male for every 100 female livebirths
have been reported from several Micronesian populations. Analyses of linked family records
dating from before 1942 for the native people of Guam reveal a highly masculinized SSR even
at high birth orders and parental ages of married fertile couples. These findings contrast with
reported declines in SSR with parity and parental age among historical and modern populations
in Europe and North America where such declines often have been ascribed to the effects of
decreasing mean coital frequencies associated with marital duration and spousal age. This study
challenges implicit assumptions about the supposed universality of Euroamerican patterns of
marital sexual behavior and supports the coital frequency hypothesis of SSR determination.

The proportion of males to females,
more readily ascertained than an accurate age composition of many anthropological populations, has long attracted the attention of anthropologists
and demographers. Even rough estimates of age categories along with
knowledge of the sex structure of human populations have been used to
seek insights into past lifeways, differential migration, and/or mortality experiences responsible for the observed
distribution of the age cohorts, by
gender, composing an entire group.
Krzywicki (1934, p. 230), for example,
argued that the greater surplus of adult
females among the maritime Chukchee
demonstrated the more dangerous lifeways of adult males who followed a
maritime subsistence pattern than
those of their reindeer-hunting kinsmen. A marked paucity of females,
particularly in younger age groups,
may suggest that a society has practiced female infanticide, while a relative deficit of males and females born

in many parts of the world a few years
before 1920 is likely to be ascribed to
the effects of the influenza pandemic of
the same period.

Underlying these exercises and estimates is the assumption of a basic,
slightly masculinized near-uniformity
in the secondary sex ratio, the relative
proportions of males and females at
birth. Based on analyses of comprehensive and complete registrations
covering millions of births in Europe
and the United States, the secondary
sex ratio is usually reported as more
than 105 males born for every 100
females (SSR = > 105), according to
Parkes (1976), inter alia. Slight
variations—as in the lower SSR among
African-Americans in the United
States, as a result of random fluctuations observed in small-scale groups or
over brief periods of observation, in
the offspring of mothers who smoke, of
parents afflicted with certain diseases
or with certain blood group combinations, or, temporarily, in the offspring

of returning war veterans—are often
seen as minor aberrations from the basic universality of the phenomenon,
useful mainly in attempting to elucidate the underlying responsible mechanisms. Indeed, observed deviations
may even be used to question the accuracy and/or completeness of birth
registrations, as in the recent case of
the One Percent Survey of China for
1987 (Hull, 1990). Willigan and Lynch
(1982, p. 65) warn that ‘“‘any sex ratio
over 1.10 (derived from baptismal
records) may be sufficient to call into
serious question the completeness of
the registration of female births, if such
a ratio lasts over a period of years.”

Understanding of the basic mechanism of male sex determination (inheritance of the Y chromosome, or, more
specifically, the sry gene carried on
that chromosome) has been accompanied by increasingly refined techniques
for identifying the chromosomal or genetic sex of aborted embryos and fetuses. However, since many products
of conception may be lost and undiscovered in the earliest days after fertilization, it is virtually impossible to
estimate satisfactorily the primary sex
ratio (PSR), the relative proportion of
male to female conceptions. Accordingly, any differences in the SSR
among diverse populations are assumed not to reflect significant variations in the PSR or the underlying
physiological processes surrounding
fertilization.

In his comprehensive review of the
subject, James (1978a, p. 730) notes a
“substantial body of evidence that
there are birth order, paternal age, and
possibly maternal age effects on sex
ratio. ...”’ He hypothesizes (James
19875, p. 873) that “hormone levels of

Secondary Sex Ratios

201

both parents at the time of conception
affect the probability of a male birth,
high levels of estrogen and testosterone increasing this probability, and
high levels of gonadotropin decreasing
it.”” As he has pointed out, high coital
rates over the course of the female cycle should ensure that sperm are
present in the vaginal tract in the midcycle, when estrogen and testosterone
levels peak, and in the late-cycle when
gonadotropin levels drop. Thus, it is
surprising that James does not call for
further investigations of associations
between coital rates and sex ratio in his
plea for additional testing of this hypothesis (James, 1990). The present
study is, however, in part a response to
his call to other workers to test the hypothesis “in whatever way is open to
them” and, in part, to add to the ethnodemographic literature materials relating to Pacific island populations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The present study is based on data
derived from a linked family record
register for the native population of
Guam covering the period prior to the
beginning of World War II hostilities in
this part of the Pacific. These materials, more fully described elsewhere
(Underwood 1990b), include 38,884
individual records. However, many of
the results shown below, as indicated,
derive from a separate set of reproductive histories for 4,177 couples whose
marriages were registered between
1901 and October 1941. Of these,
3,406 unions had produced over 18,000
offspring by the end of the period, and
the reproductive histories of 3,317
first-married women were included.

RESULTS

While the overall sex ratio for all individuals contained in the larger data
base set is 101.0, this figure obscures
the marked difference between sex ratio for those born before 1898 (88.4),
the remaining survivors in 1897 of earlier mortality and migration experiences, and 106.7 for those born between 1901 and 1941, all of whose
births are included. This latter figure is
not directly synonymous with the SSR
for all births in the more recent time
period since individuals born and also
dying between 1898 and 1901 were not
listed in registration records. Moreover, SSR differences also distinguish
marital (SSR = 106.8) and nonmarital
(SSR = 105.6) fertility patterns for
those born after 1900.

In contrast with other studies cited
by James (1983a, 1983b, 1987a), the
sex ratio does not decline with parental
age or birth order in fertile married

- Guamanians (Table 1), rather increas
ing from 107.2 for first-born offspring
to 109.7 for it* order births for fathers.

Underwood

Social Biology

A less marked increase in the sex ratio
of offspring born to married mothers
(from 109.3 to 110.2) is not matched by
comparable changes in the mean age of
mothers by birth order (Table 2), although the mean age of fathers of it
order male births (36.62 years) differs
from paternal mean age at birth of it
order females (36.02). This pattern is
also evident from an examination of
records for only those parents born before 1895, all or most of whom would
have completed reproductive histories
by 1941 (Table 3).

The relationship between birth order and SSR, as shown in Table 4, also
fails to conform to the findings of most
previous studies. Among children born
before 1942 to married Guamanians,
SSR is essentially as high (110.5) in the
higher order (> 9) birth group as in
the group of lower order births (111.1),
i.e., for birth orders 1 through 5. And
despite the age differential between
mothers and fathers born before 1895,
this same pattern of higher sex ratio in
lower- and higher-order births persists
(Table 5), indicating the greater influ

DISCUSSION

The role of coital frequency as a significant proximate determinant has
long been recognized in frameworks
for the study of human fertility (Davis
and Blake, 1956; Bongaarts and Potter, 1983; Wood 1990; inter alia). Surveys, almost all among European and
American populations, report declining mean frequencies of sexual intercourse with age and with marital duration (Leridon, 1977), but the possible
effects of declining female fecundabil

ity and increasing levels of spontaneous abortions in older mothers have
been the major foci of interest in studies of secondary infertility. In order to
reconcile the observed decline among
Euroamericans in sex ratio of offspring
born to older parents and/or in marriages of longer duration, it also has
been necessary to assume higher levels
of intrauterine loss among male con
“ceptuses (Parkes, 1976; Mealey and

Mackey, 1990). Sieff’s review (1990)
reveals that this latter assumption is
highly problematic, however. In any
case, studies among non-Western
groups seem generally to have assumed
the universality of the Euroamerican

coital frequency pattern of decline with
age and/or marital duration, the De
Vries effect (James 1987b, p. 878).

Reliable information on SSR (or
fertility) among traditional Pacific island populations is extremely limited
and may be based on older census materials of dubitable equality. In Micronesia, Hunt et al. (1965) reported a sex
ratio of 110 for 1,804 livebirths from
census materials for Yap. Marshall
(1975) used municipal records and field
notes to reconstruct the number of
livebirths on Namoluk Atoll for the period 1945-72, resulting in a very high
SSR value of 137.1 for 294 total births.
For nearby Etal Atoll, Nason (1975),
using interviews and census materials
covering the period 1948-68, reported
a total of 112 male and 98 female livebirths (SSR = 114.3).

These studies, however, do not consider SSR in relation to parental age or
birth order. Most recently, Brewis
(1992) has calculated an SSR of 111
from reproductive histories of 636 livebirths on Butaritari Atoll, a value re
ceiving confirmation from the SSR

value of 113 she derived from 5,470
livebirths reported in Butaritari vital
records. Thus, despite marked differences in source materials, population
sizes, and time periods covered, existing reports confirm the results of the
present study in the historical demography of Guam. In contrast with the
Euroamerican pattern, the SSR among
Micronesian populations appears from
limited demographic data to express a
consistently strong male bias at lower
and higher birth orders and with increasing parental age.

I have previously (1990a) reported
for the historic Chamorro population
low levels (6.6 per cent) of marital infertility and relatively high levels of extramarital (22 per cent) and premarital
(ca. 32 per cent) fertility. The present
study reveals that a relatively late age
at marriage of fertile women (21.9
years) was accompanied by advanced
maternal age at time of last reported
birth. Among 1,012 final livebirths to
married women born before 1895, over
70 per cent (N = 717) were reported
for women aged 35 years or older, with
45 per cent of all final parturitions occurring to women in their 40’s and 50’s.
For married fathers born before 1895,
59.5 per cent (N = 755) of 1,269 i" order offspring were born to fathers 40
years of age or older. On this evidence

alone, it is clear that levels of marital
intercourse remained high throughout
the pre- and peri-menopausal periods,
when female fecundity was expectably
declining and the probability of fetal
loss may have been increasing.

As discussed elsewhere, prevailing
sociocultural patterns encouraged high
levels of marital sexual activity and reproduction among Chamorros, almost
all of whom were adherents of the Roman Catholic religion during this period. Anecdotal and ethnographic evidence indicate a high value was placed
on continuing sexual activity of married men and women and on the rearing of large families. Heterogeneity
in actual practice and in fecundability
are suggested by the declining SSR

completed family sizes. For those couples with higher completed family size,
coital frequency and male bias in SSR
obviously continued at high levels.
This is further confirmed by the minimal difference in mean birth interval
(22.56 months) of women with completed family sizes of 6 to 9 children
and those with completed family sizes
of 10 or more (21.60 months). Differentials in completed family size were
obviously far more dependent on stopping behavior than on spacing mechanisms for married women born before
1895.

Only further studies in relatively
more traditional Micronesian societies
can confirm the suggested Micronesian
pattern of continuing high levels of sex

ual activity regardless of age or marital
duration responsible for elevated SSR
values so far reported for island populations in this part of the Pacific.
Brewis (1992) has suggested that high
SSR values with age of partners and
marital duration actually provide an indirect estimate of high levels of continuing marital sexual activity, and her
ethnodemographic research on Buta
-ritari Atoll amply documents the asso
ciation. At the least, these studies directly support James’ hypothesis of the
role of coital frequency in SSR determination and constitute a serious challenge to the assumed universality of at
least certain aspects of Euroamerican
patterns of marital sexual behavior.
