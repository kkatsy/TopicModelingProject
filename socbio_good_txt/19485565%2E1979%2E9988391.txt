Frequency of Fatal Congenital Anomalies
of the Nervous System: Association with

Geographic Latitude

ABSTRACT: We report a significant pole-to-equator gradient in fatal congenital defects of the central
nervous system whose rates increase directly with increasing latitudes in either hemisphere of the
American continent. This gradient was not observed in deaths due to malformations of other organ
systems and is in the opposite direction to the well-recognized one between latitude and childhood

mortality.

An opportunity for studying possible
associations between latitude and birth
defects was provided by an internationally
sponsored ten-country investigation of
childhood mortality conducted by fifteen
collaborating groups in widely scattered

areas of the American continent (Puffer

and Serrano, 1973; Munan, 1973). Interlaboratory comparability was achieved
because differences in data collection,
case ascertainment and diagnostic criteria
between areas were minimized by procedures described below.

For eight of the fifteen areas selected
for this analysis, longitude varied less than
8° while latitude varied widely (78°). Since
the basis for selection of study areas was
interest and willingness of researchers to
participate rather than their geographic
location, the shape of the study area as a

“narrow swath extending over about half of

the distance between poles was entirely
fortuitous (Figure 1). It is also important
to underscore that the objective of the collaborative investigation was to study
childhood mortality, not to test the

strength of latitude or longitude relationships to disease distributions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The field inquiry began with the
identification of death certificates of
children under five years of age dying
during a two-year period in each area
listed in Table 1 and continued with a review of clinical and autopsy records and
with household interviews. The investigation thus excluded stillbirths. Data on pertinent circumstances surrounding each
death were entered onto pretested and
standardized questionnaires and examined in each area by a group of pediatricians, obstetricians, pathologists, and epidemiologists with a view to ascribing an
accurate cause of death.

All data collected on approximately
37,100 childhood deaths (of which 27,600
were infants under one year of age) were
again reviewed centrally by a separate expert group appointed by the Pan American Health Organization/World Health

Organization. The procedure assured
consistency in the application of criteria to
define principal and associated causes for
each death and thereby reduced bias due
to differences in diagnostic practices
among study areas.

The following are the criteria used for
inclusion of data in this analysis: (1) congenital defects leading to death during the
first year of life; (2) congenital defects
diagnosed as the underlying cause of
death; and (3) deaths occuring in urban
centers situated in a narrow north-south
band less than 10° wide.

   
     
    
  

Social Biology

Expressions of cause-specific infant
mortality rates usually have as the denominator the number of live births. In the cities under study, birth registration varied
in the degree of completeness. In several
areas additional birth data were obtained
by examining hospital and baptismal records and estimating the number of home
deliveries from midwives and similar
sources (Puffer and Serrano, 1973).

Mortality rates are assembled in Table
1 and classified by the degree of latitude of
each area under study. They are analyzed
for significance of pole-to-equator gradients in either hemisphere using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. This
nonparametric Statistic provides a useful
approximation for estimating concomitant variations in small series. As used
here, the geographic areas are ranked
from 1 to 8 as you move from lowest to
highest death rates and from lowest to
highest latitude. Spearman’s formula
follows:

—1_ 62d

 

m—n

where d is the difference between two
ranks and n is the number of pairs of observation.

RESULTS

Death rates due to all congenital defects combined did not have well-defined
hemispheric clines, nor did those due separately to congenital malformations of the
circulatory system, of the digestive system, or to mongolism. (Table 1). Only
birth defects of the central nervous system
had a Statistically significant latitudinal
gradient (r = 0.79), with rates diminishing as the equator was approached from
either pole.

Rates for congenital defects of organ
systems other than those specified above,

Spiratory, musculo-skeletal, or genitourinary systems are combined and listed
under “Other” in Table 1. These also
showed significant latitude associations.
This gradient, however, was based upon
two fewer rates than the others, and at the
same time the dates were also less reliable
due to lower frequency of occurrence.

Of note in Table 1 is the well-known
correlation between high childhood mortality and low latitudes. The direction of
this correlation is opposite to that noted
for the relationship of fatal nervous system anomalies to latitude.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

It would be unproductive to regard the
significant gradients in congenital defects
of the central nervous system as odd observations simply because no ready explanation becomes apparent. To view
them as reflections of more general poleto-equator mortality gradients is contrary
to known facts, and to ascribe them to
differentials in diagnostic practices would
also be unrewarding. As stated, other congenital defects more difficult to diagnose
than malformations of the nervous system
do not show clines (Table 1).

Several studies dealing with the relationship between latitudes and congenital
malformations have appeared. One,
based on world-wide data, supports the
hypothesis that the earth’s geomagnetic
fields and cosmic rayflux, differing tn intensity as you move away from the poles,
are importantly associated with the distribution of fatal congenital malformations
of any type (Wesley, 1960). A study by Alter (1963) found that a more northern
community had significantly higher incidence of anencephalic births than a more
southern one in the North American hemisphere.

and spina bifida with longitude have also

been reported and reviewed (Hewitt,
1963; Elwood 1976). Longitudinal disease-specific patterns in North America
are described, showing the incidence of
anencephaly, spina bifida, and hydrocephalus declining from east to west with
no difference or increase in other kinds of
malformation. Geographic variations in
anencephaly interpretable in part by human migrations, mineral content of water,
cosmic radiation and other factors have
been more recently analyzed and discussed (Elwood, 1977, 1979; Archer
1979). |

This paper cannot fully examine and
explain the latitude dependency of deaths
due to defects in structures arising out of
the neural tube. A more detailed sociobiologic and environmental assessment
would be needed, focusing on the role of
maternal age, parity, and nutrition; of
birth rank of the newborn; of socloeconomic, ethnic, genetic, and environmental variables of the family; and
especially of incidences of congenital defects in aborted fetuses.

A suggestion was proffered on the nature of the correlation of central nervous
system birth defects with latitude, namely,
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

that it might reflect social factor differences such as maternal and child care. We
therefore collected data shown in Table 2
on percentage of mothers of deceased infants who received prenatal care in each of
the eight cities under study and ran a correlation analysis against latitudinal rank of
the cities as described under ‘“‘Methods’’
above. The Spearman rank correlation
coefficient was of the order of 0.74, indicating that medical attention rendered
during pregnancy and delivery, expressed
quantitatively and without regard to the
quality of care, also varies directly with
latitude as do the mortality rates of congenital defects of the nervous but not of
other systems. These results underscore
the complexity of the phenomenon under
observation and are remindful of the
difficulties equally encountered in accounting for the disease-specific east-west
patterns discussed above.

It would be difficult to explain our observations on the basis of poor reporting
of early neonatal deaths or of live births,
that is, as being due to numerator or denominator effects in the estimation of
death rates. With respect to the first concern, it is true that anencephalics dying
soon after birth would have been considered as stillbirths and therefore not included in the study. On the other hand,
many stillbirth records after being examined for evidence of life in the infant
(attempts at respiration, heartbeat, etc.)
were included in the study group. Also
arguing against underreporting of death is
the fact that, unlike cardiac and other
anomalies which in our study did not show
similar trends, anencephaly and most
other anomalies of the nervous system are

diagnoses which cannot be easily missed.
With respect to the second concern,
namely the underreporting of. births in
some areas (the denominator effect), especially those at lower latitudes, it would
seem that this would result in increases in
congenital defect death rates for these
areas as compared to areas at higher latitudes leading to an inverse correlation
rather than the observed direct one. What
we also see is a decrease with decreasing
latitude in cause-specific death rates for
the congenital defects of the nervous system but not for the other systems, which is
not explainable by a simple denominator
effect. In sum, we note at least one drawback to any single explanation for the phenomenon in question.

The body of data analyzed here (Puffer
and Serrano, 1973), although substantial,
is regrettably too small for many
stratifications of interest. At this juncture,
we think it unlikely that geographic location alone could override such sociobiologic characteristics as have been mentioned. Under our conditions, the
phenomenon is almost specific as to organ
system anomalies and is devoid of the
east-west effects which have been reported (Hewitt, 1963; Elwood, 1976) as
being contributory. The observation is
nonetheless there and, whatever its explanation, is deserving of note.
