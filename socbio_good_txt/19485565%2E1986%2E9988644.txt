Macroanalytic Study of Development and Fertility:
Consideration of Transition Models

ABSTRACT: Macroanalytic studies of the relationship of fertility and development have been
applied in the past based mostly on cross-sectional aggregate data from various countries. Because these countries belong to different models of the epidemiologic transition, variation in the
dynamic relationship among these models should be allowed for. In this paper, various techniques (including linear and quadratic regression, a minimum-maximum method of plotting
the relationship, a special approach of stepwise regression) were applied to a data set from 85
countries. The crude birth rate was used as the dependent variable with several demographic,
economic, social health, and family planning indicators as independent variables, measures
over the period 1950-75. The results confirm the existence of submodels of countries with varying relationships between fertility and its correlates. The results disallow direct transferability
of the experience of one group of countries (such as Europe) to another group belonging to another model (such as the less developed countries). The study also found the strength of the
family planning effort to be a significant factor and one to be singled out as a major contributor
in the fertility decline between 1965-75 in the developing countries. Its effect, however, stands

to be enhanced in various degrees by concurrent social and economic development.

In the growing debate about the relative role of development variables in fertility change, macroanalytic studies
have been many. These studies are usually based on cross-sectional aggregate
data for multiple countries to which various correlation, regression, and multivariate techniques are applied in an attempt to isolate fertility determinants.
Little attention has been given in these
analytic studies to the fact that the countries used may belong to different transition models in which the dynamics of
fertility and mortality change may vary,
and in which the dynamics may differ in
the component models from the aggregate of these models. It is possible,
therefore, that some of the dynamics of

259

fertility and mortality in the aggregate
may be an artifact.

The models referred to in this study
are those described by Omran (1971,
1977, 1982) in his Epidemiologic Transition Theory. In that theory, several
transition models were identified and
characterized according to the pace and
dynamics of mortality and fertility
change in different societal settings. The
Classical Model represents the health
and demographic transition in Western
societies over the last two centuries, that
of a gradual decline in mortality, followed by a similar decline in fertility. A
variant of this model was described for
Japan and several eastern European
countries where fertility decline was ac

celerated by family planning and induced abortion; hence, the name Accelerated Model of the Epidemiologic
Transition. The Delayed Model is seen
in the less developed countries where
the mortality transition was delayed until well into the twentieth century, while
fertility maintains its high levels. The
Transitional Variant of the Delayed
Model is described for a number of less
developed countries (LCD’s) where fertility started to decline in the mid1960’s, or thereafter.

In this report, we aim to examine the
extent to which the interaction between
development variables and fertility varies from one transition model to the
other, to identify possible artifacts in the
macroanalytic approach to corroborate
(or refute) a development-fertility covariation, and to assess the relative role
of family planning and socioeconomic
factors in the recent fertility changes in
the developing countries. Although this
paper is limited to an examination of the
macroanalytic approach to the relationship between development and fertility
variables, the ascertainment that distinctive models of interactions exist has
significant implications for policy formulation and strategy selection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Tn order to serve the objectives of this
study, a data set was built in the Population Epidemiology Unit of the Carolina
Population Center for macroanalysis
containing national information on the
annual demographic, health, social, and
economic status of 85 countries for the
period 1950-75. As might be expected,
the choice of the variables was problematic. Despite the universal importance
of socioeconomic development as a goal

Omran and Salama

 

Social Biology

of international and national interest,
there is no clear and agreed-upon definition of this concept. As in other studies,
we are relying on a group of indicators
approximating the concept. Initially, we
collected data on some 54 indicators, a
list eventually narrowed down to the 20
indicators given in Table 1. Care was
taken to select indicators commonly
used in other studies in order to allow
comparability with those studies. To increase the accuracy of data, several
sources were used for each variable.
Temporally, a few gaps still exist, especially for the 1950’s; nevertheless, the
resulting data set allows not only crosssectional, but also time series analysis.

Throughout this paper, the dependent variable used is the crude birth
rate. While we are fully aware of its limitations, especially its dependence on age
structure, it is the one indicator that is
readily available for a multitude of
countries over the 25-year period. Fortunately, its correlation with other,
more refined measures of fertility is satisfactorily high.

Various Statistical techniques are
used in this study to explore the following issues in terms of the models of the
Epidemiologic Transition.

(a) the nature of the
development relationship,

(b) the transferability of the fertilitydevelopment relationship between
different models of the Epidemiologic Transition theory, 71

(c) the stability of the  fertilitydevelopment relationship (e.g., of
the correlation coefficients) over
time, |

(d) the differential strength of the
fertility-development relationship
between different Epidemiologic
Transition models,

(e) the comparative effects of family
planning programs and development
on fertility decline.

RESULTS

THE NATURE OF THE
FERTILITY-DEVELOPMENT RELATIONSHIP

First, simple regression analysis was
used to examine the nature of the relationship between socioeconomic variables and fertility (as measured by the
crude birth rate). A simple regression

 

model was considered because it is a
simple model and has been used in earlier studies. However, the simple regression approach was rejected after examination of the plots, and relevant
statistics made it evident that for the majority of the variables the relationship
was by no means linear.

A quadratic equation was then used

 

 
 

262

to represent the relationship of each socioeconomic variable and fertility. The
results, given in Figures 1.1-1.8, reveal
a curvilinear relationship with fertility.

maximum fertility level = Yung = maximum of (Yi,. . ., Yin;); minimum fertility level = Ypinj = minimum of (Ya,
an ag Yang)

Plotting the three fertility levels, (Xi,
Yi), (Xi, Yenaxi), (Xi Ymini) for all Xj gives
us an indication about the general relationship between the development variable X and the corresponding range of
fertility levels (see Figure 2).

The min-max method, simple as it
may be, is a reasonable supplement to
regression equations in graphically characterizing the relationship between
some development variable, X, and fertility. It avoids the restrictive nature of
the particular prespecified regression
model (linear, quadratic, etc.) and allows more flexibility without the complications of fitting a higher degree regression model. The min-max approach is
used here as a descriptive tool to give us
a clear idea about the overall structure
and range of the data points.

As an illustration, we will compare
the results in the combined Classical and

in both models simultaneously (Table

Agriculture and Infant Mortality Rate
for the Transitional Variant countries,
and the number of variables in common
here is also 0. Table 4 gives a summary
of these results.

To make sense of these numbers, we
note that if there is a full agreement between two submodels, then the sequence of number of common variables
should be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, corresponding to
the five steps of the regression. On the
other hand, if we do not have an agreement, than we may get a sequence such
as 0, 0,1, 3,5. This idea was introduced
by Salama and Quade (1982). To test for
the similarity of two submodels, they
suggest the test statistic

where 7; is the number of common variables between the two submodels in the
i® step of the regression, and n is the
number of independent variables in the
model. They also provide a table for
critical values for this procedure. Thus,
to test for similarity between Classical/
Accelerated and Transitional Variant
Models for the five example variables
above, we have: 7; = 0, T> = 0, 73 = 1,
T, = 3, Ts; = 5, wheren = 5.

That gives:

T=94 944434343

= 2.08, with p = 0.1.

Similarly, Transitional, versus Delayed
models gives us a T = = 2 andp = 0.1,

To test for similarity between
Classical/Accelerated and Delayed, we
have T= 42 =3.91 with p-value
= 0.175. These results confirm our conjecture that these three models are different.

STABILITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP
OVER TIME

One of the points considered here is
the stability of the relationship between
fertility and the socioeconomic variables
over time. For this purpose, we selected
the Kendall rank order correlation coefficient between CBR and the socioeconomic variables for each submodel of
the Epidemiologic Transition. The
choice of Kendall correlation is based on
its descriptive nature which fits the purpose of this analysis. Table 5 shows the
values of the correlation for the five 5year time periods, 1950-75, under consideration, as well as the corresponding
p-values. Table 6 summarizes these relations and gives for each submodel the
maximum correlation, the minimum
correlation (and the same for the pvalues). It is evident from this table that:

1. For the developed countries
(Classical/Accelerated Model), the maximum absolute correlation occurs at the
fifth period (Fem.-L.F. at the fourth) and
the minimum absolute correlation occurs
at the middle period (Period 1 for Fem.~
L.F.). Also, the smallest p-value (i.e.,
most highly significant) occurred at the
fifth period (Fem-L.F. at Period 3).

2. For the transitional countries, the
maximum absolute correlation occurs in
the fifth period (Fem—L.F. occurs in Period 1). The minimum absolute correlation occurred in Period 1 (Per Cent Literate occurred in Period 4 and Fem-L.F.
occurred in Period 5). The smallest pvalue occurred in Period 5 (Fem-L.F.
Period 1).

3. There is no clear pattern describing
the correlations for the delayed Model
countries except that, generally, the maximum absolute correlation occurred in
Periods 4 and 5 for four variables, and
Period 2 for all variables. The minimum
p-value occurred at Period 5 for three

bles occur?”’ The underlying hypothesis
is that if fertility is dependent on development, the strongest correlation
should occur in the Transitional Model
where fertility has been actively declining since the mid-1960s’. To answer that
question, we Cannot consider the correlation values shown in Table 5 because
of the changing sample size between the
different models, as well as the possible
change over time. However, we can use
the p-value tables for this comparison
where a small value reflects a significant
relation. Table 7 gives the corresponding ranks for the p-values, within each
time period, for each variable, and Table 8 gives the strength of the correlation
between fertility and socioeconomic indicators for different models (1 for the

 

smallest p-value, i.e., the strongest). It
is evident that:

1. For Infant Mortality Rate, the
strongest correlation occurred in the Developed and Transitional groups; the
weakest occurred in the Delayed model.

2. For Gross National Product, the
strongest correlation occurred in the
Transitional model, followed by the
Classical/Accelerated model; the weakest occurred in the Delayed model.

3. For Per Cent Literate and Female
Labor Force, the strongest correlation
occurred in the Classical/Accelerated
model; the levels of correlation in the
Transitional and Delayed groups are similar.

4. For Per Cent in Agriculture, the
strongest correlation occurred in the
Transitional group; the Classical/
Accelerated and Delayed models had almost similar patterns.

RELATIVE ROLE OF FAMILY PLANNING
VERSUS DEVELOPMENT IN THE RECENT
FERTILITY DECLINE IN LDC’s.

In this section, we study the relative
effect of the family planning program
versus the socioeconomic factors in explaining fertility changes as revealed by
the data. For this purpose, the transitional and underdeveloped groups were
added together. The results are summarized in Table 9. The dependent variable
is the difference between crude birth
rates in the base period and the terminal
period; the independent variables are
the same five socioeconomic variables
mentioned earlier for the base period.
In the first column of Table 9, the base
period is the third period and the terminal period is fourth. This means that
there is a five-year lag with Base Period
3. The second column represents Base
Period 4 with lag of five years, and the
third column represents Base Period 3
with a lag of ten years. A similar result
was obtained when the dependent variable is the per cent change in Crude Birth
Rate with respect to the base period.

It is clear from Table 9 that the
strength of the family planning program
is a significant and important factor to be
singled out as a major contributor to fertility changes during the years 1965-75.

3 and 4, the total effect of the family
planning program is more than the joint
total effect of all socioeconomic factors
together; the same is also true for the net
effect. This result holds when the dependent variable is the per cent change in
CBR. We also note that the joint effect
of the family planning program and the
socioeconomic factors are highest in
both cases, which corroborates the importance of such programs in the developmental process.

The above conclusion is based purely
on the data presented here. It does not
go beyond that to any philosophical discussion concerning which comes first or
which comes last. What we observed
here is that their joint effect is high. Actually, in one model the joint effect is

higher than the combined net effect of
the socioeconomic factor and the family
planning program.

DISCUSSION

Macroanalytic studies of the relationship of fertility and development indicators have been reported in literature
over the last two decades (see, for example: Weintraub, 1962; Heer and Turner,
1965; Heer, 1966; Friedlander and Silver, 1967; Janowitz, 1971, 1973; Kirk,
1971; Ekanem, 1972; Gregory et al.,
1972; Tsui and Bogue, 1978; and
Mauldin and Berelson, 1978; among
others). For a quick review of the literature, see the report by Mauldin and
Berelson (1978). The features of our

study that differ from those in the literature include: (a) the consideration of
transition models; (5) the consideration
of stability of the interaction over time;
and (c) the use of new and/or modified
statistical techniques in this analysis.

Five major issues have evolved from
our analysis:

1. The nonlinearity of the relationship
between fertility and development indicators was demonstrated.

2. The analysis confirmed the existence of submodels where the interaction
of fertility and development indicators
vary from one model to the other.

3. The temporal variation (i.e., lack
of stability over time) of the relationships
was also demonstrated.

4. The expected higher strength of interaction in the Transitional Model was
not confirmed.

5. Our findings confirmed those reported by other studies (e.g., Mauldin
and Berelson, 1978, and Tsui and Bogue,
1978) in regard to the explanation of recent fertility decline in developing countries. Our study confirmed that such a decline could be explained, statistically,
more by family planning effort than by
national development. At the same time,

Omran and Salama

Social Biology

it was found that the combined effect of
both family planning and development is
larger than either one alone.

Finally, while the variation of the dynamic relationship between fertility and
development indicators from one group
of countries to another was proven statistically, this area is in need of further
investigation, using larger data sets and
using different statistical models.

Two major conclusions can be made
in this regard:

1. It is risky to assume the transferability of the experience of one transition model in a group of countries to another. Hence, the historical experience
of Western countries should not be the
basis for predicting the population dynamics in the developing countries.

2. From our data, it is clear that the
strength of the family planning effort is a
significant and important factor to be
singled out as a major contributor to fertility decline. Its effect, however, stands
to be enhanced by concurrent social and
economic development.
