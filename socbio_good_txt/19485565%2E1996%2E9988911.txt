ABSTRACT: Between the early 1970’s and 1990’s, twelve industrialized nations experienced for
the first time a narrowing of their sex differences in life expectancy at age zero. In another set
of countries, the differential has not yet reached a stage of convergence, although in some of these
nations the female advantage appears to be increasing at a slower pace than ever before. We
discuss the demographic and epidemiologic conditions for this new and largely unanticipated
trend, as well as its applied and theoretical implications in the context of the following questions:
(1) Is the observed change a function of males’ faster pace of gains in life expectancy since the
early 1970s? (2) What is the relationship between country differences in socioeconomic development (as measured by GNP) and the degree of convergence in the sex gap in average length
of life? (3) What is the degree of association between temporal change in age-sex specific death
rates and change in the sex gap in life expectancy over the twenty-year interval between the early
1970s and early 1990s? Our results indicate that where Some convergence has taken place, in
relation to women, men have experienced more rapid gains in survival; the higher a nation’s level
of social and economic development, the greater the amount of convergence in male and female
life expectancies. The most pronounced age-specific association with the changing sex gap in
longevity is that of ages 25-59, where the greater reductions in male mortality, as compared to
that for females, contributed to a significant portion of the observed convergence in life expectancy across industrialized nations.

Since the turn of this century, the another set of countries the differential
sex gap in life expectancy has widened has not yet reached a stage of converin all Western countries from approxi- gence, but over the last two decades
mately two to three years in favor of the female advantage appears to be inwomen, to the current difference inthe creasing at a slower pace than ever berange of four to seven years (Lopez, fore. By its very nature, this unprece1983; Nathanson, 1984; Nathanson dented development falls in the same

mographic events was their unexpectedness, such that few scholars had predicted a priori their developments.

As far as we can determine, on an
international scale there is no sign of
convergence prior to the early part of
the 1970's. For instance, in his analysis
of thirty nations in the interval between 1950 and 1978, Lopez (1983)
presents data which indicate that only
between the quinquennial periods of
1970-74 and 1975-78 do we see some
evidence of narrowing sex differences
in life expectation, with five countries
(Japan, Austria, England-Wales,
Northern Ireland, and Scotland) showing a 0.10 of a year reduction in their
differentials. Although he paid no attention to this numerical fact, in his
concluding comments he stated that
there exists “. . . the [eventual] possibility of a stabilization, if not reduction, in the size of the sex mortality differential” (p. 106).

Olshansky and Ault (1986) noted
that in the early part of the 1980’s
the United States had entered a new
stage of epidemiological development,
which they call the ‘‘age of delayed and
degenerative diseases,”’ characterized
(among other things) by a general delay of the ages at which chronic and
degenerative diseases tend to kill. An
important corollary of this stage of epidemiological transition is that future
gains in longevity will be made increasingly at older ages since gains at the
younger ages have become smaller
over time and may be reaching a plateau in terms of further improvements.
In this context, they project that ‘“‘the
historical pattern of a widening gap in
longevity between the sexes . . . [will
come] to an end during the fourth stage

 

Life Expectancy 21

of epidemiological transition in the
United States” (p. 364). They did not
elaborate the reasons underlying this
prediction, nor did they offer any indication as to whether the same trend
would prevail in other nations.

Only very recently have there been
systematic attempts at documenting
the possibility that male/female mortality differences in the industrialized
world may be declining. In her investigation of sex differences mortality
for adults in the developed world, Waldron (1993) discovered that across 22
nations between the years of 1977 and
1979, male/female mortality ratios continued to increase for persons in the
age group 25-34, but at the older ages
the pattern is mixed. For example,
death ratios went up for 55-64 year

‘olds in Southern Europe, Eastern

Europe and in Japan, but declined in
some North European societies and
among Anglo-Saxon nations. In Canada, Gee and Veevers (1988) examined changes in sex ratios in mortality
for the period 1966 to 1985 for the age
groups of 45-54 and 55-64. They
showed some evidence of a middleaged turnaround in the sex differential.

Given the recency of this phenomenon, and its generality across a significant portion of the industrialized
world, analysis is timely and will be of
practical value to those interested in
establishing parameters for sex differences in life expectancy in the context
of mortality projections (e.g., Olshansky, 1988; Valkonen, 1991; Coale,
1990; Krishnan, 1992; Lee and Carter,
1990; Bulatao and Bos, 1990; McNown
and Rogers, 1990; Manton et al.,
1991). Theorists will want to consider
the implications of this new trend for

its sociological and social psychological
underpinnings in the context of rapid
social and demographic change: We
feel that this development is part of a
larger configuration of social and demographic evolution witnessed by the
industrialized world during the postWar years.

The onset of narrowing sex differences in survival may be closely associated with convergence in genderbased behaviors and life styles in
recent decades (Nathanson, 1992; Waldron, 1993; Wister and Gee, 1994).
For example, it has been hypothesized
that sex differences in mortality have
begun to decrease in the industrialized
countries due to decreasing sex differences in several behaviors which have
contributed to men’s higher mortality
in the past. The rise in smoking among
women and their increased participation in the labor force have been cited
as two possible interrelated processes
contributing to this development (Waldron, 1993).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Unlike previous studies, such as
those of Waldron’s (1993) and Gee and
Veevers’ (1988), our investigation is
not based on changing sex ratios in
mortality, but with the changing sex
differential in life expectancy at age
zero over the interval from the early
1970’s to the early 1990’s. Our approach conveniently summarizes the
mortality experience of the sexes over
the complete age span as opposed to
only the mortality ratios of target age
groups. A desirable feature of our procedure is that life expectancy is a standardized measure of survival which

 

Social Biology

takes into account age and sex compositional differences across societies. In
another section of our analysis we examine the association of age-sex specific changes in death rates to the
amount of variance explained in the
dependent variable in order to infer
the relative importance of changes in
sex mortality differences within age
groups to the narrowing of the sex differential in longevity at age zero.

In addition to covering a roughly
twenty-year span of observations, and
amore recent end point of analysis, we
examine a larger set of industrialized
countries (38 as opposed to 22 as in
the case of Waldron’s study, and only
one in the case of Gee and Veevers’s)
comprising both East and West European nations, the USSR, Canada,
the United States, Australia, New
Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong
Kong, and Israel. These societies are
diverse in terms of their histories, cultures, and social structures, but are
commonly related by virtue of their industrialized economies and their being
in the advanced stages of demographic
and epidemiological transitions.

We investigate three questions: The
first deals with the association of men
and women’s changes in life expectation over time to convergence in life
expectancy at age zero. We hypothesize that in countries where there is
evidence of convergence, this is mostly
a function of men’s greater rates of improvement in life expectancy over the
roughly twenty-year interval from 1970
to 1990. We base this prediction on the
assumption that in the industrialized
world female life expectation may be
approaching a plateau in terms of its
rate of gain, whereas men, by virtue of
their lower levels of life expectancy,

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

still have considerable room for further
improvements.

A second objective is to study the
association between country levels of
socioeconomic development (as measured by GNP in US dollars; Population Reference Bureau, 1994, 1975),
and the amount of convergence in life
expectancy between men and women
in the industrialized world. We surmise
that convergence should be more pronounced in the most advanced nations
of the world. We do not have data to
test for the many mechanisms involved
in this relationship, but we assume that
countries in the advanced stages of
epidemiologic and demographic transitions have social and economic structures that might be conducive to a
narrowing of the long-established sex

differential in life expectation. Our

sense is that a large part of this new
phenomenon is related to changes in
life styles among men and women in
recent decades, particularly in the
adult working ages.

Therefore, if behavioral factors are
germane to the phenomenon under
investigation, as has been suggested by
a number of authors (e.g., Nathanson,
1992; Waldron, 1993, 1990; Gee and
Veevers, 1983; Veevers and Gee,
1986), important mortality changes
should be noticed for those in the age
range from young adulthood to late

middle age. Thus, a third aspect of this

study is to explore this possible relationship by examining changes in agesex-specific death rates over time and
their association with changes in life
expectancy.

DATA

Country data for the periods around
1970 and 1990 with respect to sex
Life Expectancy 23

specific life expectancies at age zero, as
well as corresponding age-sex-specific
death rates (ages 0-15, 15-24, 25-59,
60+, and 85+) were compiled from
published tables in the United Nations
Demographic Yearbooks (1993, 1992).
A more refined classification of agespecific death rates is not available
from the published tabulations in the
Yearbooks.?

We tried as much as possible to include data for the same two periods
consistently—that is, for 1970 and
1990—but for some countries the observations are one or two years prior to
or after these time points; and on a
number of occasions, the information
for the most recent time point is for the
early to mid 1980’s (see Table 1), thus
making it impossible to incorporate
into our statistical analysis an intervening period of observation (i.e., for the
early 1980’s) between the two principal
end points.?

MEASUREMENT

A variety of numerical methods

-could be applied to examine the phe
nomenon under investigation, but
after a careful overview of the alternatives, we decided that the most appropriate and straightforward measure for

‘The 1992 and 1993 United Nations Demographic Yearbooks contain the most exhaustive listing of life expectancy by sex for the nations of the
world. These sources also contain data on age-sexspecific death rates; however, the age groupings are
not as refined as we would have liked. Notwithstanding this limitation, the classification provided
sufficient information to allow us to execute an adequate investigation of the phenomenon.

?The countries for which data do not correspond
closely to 1970 are Bulgaria (1975), Iceland and
Malta (1973). The nations for which data do not correspond closely to 1990 are Scotland (1985), USSR
(1986), West Germany (1986), Northern Ireland
(1983), Luxembourg (1986), and Republic of Ireland (1986).

our purposes is the second-order difference of period-specific differences
in male and female life expectations at
age zero. This measure can be shown
as follows:

AO = f0 ~me0 (1)
A0@ = fe ~me02 (2)
A(A@-) = AO@— AO (3)

where A°0™ and A°0@ represent symbols for sex difference in life expectancy at age zero for the periods
around 1970 (time point 1) and 1990
(time point 2), respectively; and the
letters m and f pertain to males and females. Equation (3) provides a simple
measure of change over time. A negative value would indicate a narrowing
of the sex gap in survival, while a positive value would denote the opposite
development. Within these two possible outcomes we can also take note of
the degree of convergence or divergence in the change in the sex differential in survival between the two time
points under observation.

RESULTS

Table 1 lists in rank order the
amount of convergence or divergence
in the sex gap in survival for 38 industrialized nations between two points in
time, covering roughly a twenty-year
interval between 1970 and 1990 (specific points of observations for each
country are shown in parentheses).
Hong Kong shows a reduction in its
gender gap in longevity by —1.85
years, which happens to be the largest
change among the countries in this
analysis. This reduction is followed by
the countries of Iceland (—1.32), Austria (—0.63), United States (—0.60),
Scotland and the United Kingdom

 

Social Biology

(both with values of —0.59), Canada
(—0.49), Australia (—0.37), Finland
(—0.27), USSR (—0.26), New Zealand
(—0.03) and Switzerland (—0.02).
Among the countries with positive
values in our measure of the changing
sex gap in average length of life, some
of them display larger divergences than
others, indicating that over time they
have experienced a greater degree of
expansion in female advantage in Iongevity over males. This tendency can
be demonstrated with the examples
of Hungary, Romania, Albania, Bul
 garia, Spain, and Yugoslavia, where

the differential widened by a range of
2.81 (Hungary) to 1.04 years (Yugoslavia). At the other end of this continuum, the difference grew to only 0.19,
0.18, and 0.14 in the cases of Israel,
Norway, and West Germany, respectively.

A number of patterns can be discerned from Table 1: (1) Among the
nations with positive values in their
changing sex differences in life expectancy, the largest gaps appear to be
typical of Eastern European countries,
with the notable exception of the
USSR, where as indicated earlier, a
narrowing has occurred. (2) Of those
nations with positive differences between values of 1.00 and 0.14, with the
exception of Japan, all are situated in
Europe. (3) With the exceptions of
Hong Kong and the USSR, all nations
displaying a narrowing of their sex differentials are either in Western Europe
or in North America.

These tendencies suggest that country differences in the level of socioeconomic development may be related to
the degree and direction of change
over time in the sex gap in life expectation. In this regard, it is not surpris

ing that the largest divergences tend to
prevail among the relatively less affluent nations of Eastern Europe, while
the largest convergences tend to occur
in some of the most wealthy societies of

the world.

We correlated the life expectancies
of men and women across all societies
in the early and later periods of observation, separately, with the dependent
variable. The zero-order association
was —0.24 (p = 0.11) when the male
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

expectancies in period one (i.e.,
around 1970) were entered as the independent variable. The correlation
becomes significant and increases to
—0.54 (p< 0.01) when female life expectancies in the early period were
substituted as the independent variable. Thus, societies with relatively
high female life expectancies at the beginning of the study period (around
1970) are more likely to experience
larger reductions in their sex differences in life expectation over time.

When the two sets of sex-specific life
expectancies around 1990 are put into
the analysis, the resulting correlation
goes up to —0.60 (p < 0.01) if the male
expectancy is the independent variable; and it is —0.57 (p <0.01) if female expectation is treated as the
predictor variable.

We recognize: that the dependent
variable (second-order difference) is a
linear combination of the four life expectancies used in the above correlational analysis: Two of the life expectancies have been added and two of
the remaining life expectancies are
subtracted from the sum to’ obtain the
second-order difference (i.e., AA@-®
= feo — m2) — feo + med),
Consequently, in our analysis we could
expect some positive and some negative correlations. As shown above, all
four correlations are negative, thereby
indicating that as life expectancy increases (male or female), the secondorder difference decreases. This finding may also mean that the sex
difference in longevity itself can be a
nonlinear function of expectation of
life.

As shown in Table 2, we also computed zero-order correlations between
period-specific male and female life ex
 

Social Biology

pectancies and the dependent variable
for only those 12 countries that display
a narrowing of the sex gap in longevity.
Again, all the correlations are negative, but smaller in magnitude in comparison to the ones computed earlier
for all the countries combined. As was
true of the previous correlational analysis, the male ‘coefficients become
more pronounced over time than do
those of females (i.e., the male coefficient increased from -—0.172 to
—0.403, while that of females went up
from —0.285 to —0.303).

Another set of correlations in Table
2 involves those countries with positive
differences in the dependent variable.
The corresponding coefficients in the
table are larger in magnitude than in
the previous analyses. Both genderspecific coefficients tend to increase in
magnitude over time, but the male one
increased more and Is the larger one in
the later period of observation. This
pattern of results suggests that there is
considerable variability in the extent
of change in the sex gap in longevity
within those nations where the direction of change is still positive. That is,
where the gender gap is widening,
some countries are experiencing less
divergence than others. Stated differently, in those nations where the
second-order difference is positive, the
higher the male or female life expectancy in either early 1970’s or early
1990’s, the lower is the degree of divergence in the male/female gap in
survival.

Noteworthy is the fact that in both
groups of nations the male coefficients
increased more over time than those
corresponding to females. This finding
suggests support for the notion that it
may be the temporal change in male

life expectancy which largely explains
the amount of convergence in the sex
differential in survival across countries. We explore this question in
greater detail below by examining the
varying contribution of the sexes to the
change in the male/female gap in longevity over time.

Table 3 contains ten regression
equations, seven of which are directed
to testing the effects of national variations in a given gender’s life expectation at the earlier or later point in time
on the dependent variable. Female life
expectancy in the early 1970’s is a sig
nificant predictor of the change in the
sex gap in the average length of life
(Equation [2]), while male life expectancy during this period has no significant effect (Equation [1]).

Equations (3) and (4) in Table 3 correspond to the same analysis using
gender-specific life expectations for
the later period of observation (i.e.,
around early 1990’s) as separate predictors of the change in the sex gap in
survival. In this case, the male coefficient is statistically significant and the
respective equation explains 35 per
cent of the variance in the dependent

variable. The contribution of female
life expectancy around 1990 to explaining the dependent variable is slightly
lower, with an R? of 0.330. Therefore,
level of male expectancy in around
1990 is slightly more important in predicting convergence in survival,

Equations (5) and (6) assess which
gender-specific change in expectation
of life accounts for more of the variance in the dependent variable. As
shown in the table, the change in male
expectancy is more important than the
corresponding change in female life expectancy. Moreover, the male regression coefficient is larger than that of
females’ (b = —0.306 vs. —0.105), and
the associated R? is also greater (0.389
vs. 0.028). The female equation fails to
reach statistical significance.

In Table 3 Equations (7) to (9) have
positive intercepts and negative slopes,
which implies that the change in sex
difference is positive (i.e., sex difference increases) at lower levels of the
independent variable (GNP or change
in log of GNP), and becomes negative
(i.e., sex difference decreases) at
higher levels of the predictor variable.
In general, a rise in GNP is associated
with a reduction in the sex gap in longevity, as denoted by the negative regression coefficients for both the period around 1970 and 1990. Equations
(7) and (8) show that the GNP’s of
periods one and two, respectively, explain 29 and 51 per cent of the variation
in the dependent variable, whereas
Equation (9) indicates that the larger
the gain in GNP (expressed as change
in its natural logarithm) over time, the
larger the degree of convergence in
the sex gap in longevity (b = —0.841,
R? = 0.382).

 

 

Social Biology

Equation (10) considers both GNP
around the early 1990’s and change in
male life expectancy over time simultaneously for their independent contributions to explaining cross-national
changes in the survival gap between
the sexes. These two _ variables
emerged as the most powerful predictors Im previous regressions, thus justifying their inclusion in Equation (10).

The presence of outliers was examined by calculating the residuals, and
none of the countries showed values
outside of the range of three standard
deviations. Both variables are statistically significant and explain 57 per cent
of the variance in the dependent variable. It would appear, therefore, that
an important condition for reducing
the male disadvantage in longevity in
the industrialized world would be a significant rise in national levels of GNP.
A critical mechanism in this relationship may be the GNP’s positive association with male improvements in life
style (e.g., reduction in smoking and
increased exercise) and also in the
availability and access to good health
care (Waldron, 1993). The more prosperous and socially advanced is the
nation, the more likely that men will
benefit from further developments in
health care because the gains in survival for women in such countries may
have already reached close to a maximum; consequently, men have more to
gain from any improvements in health
care. One may also hypothesize that in
the most advanced nations, a recent
consequence of changing gender roles
is that women have been increasing
their levels of tobacco consumption;
and this changing behavioral difference may be of some relevance in reDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

ducing the gender gap in life expectancy by virtue of raising female death
rates from lung cancer (Waldron,
1993).

It would seem unlikely that all age
groups would contribute equally to the
changing sex differential in survival. In
recent years scholars have observed
that the elderly have made gains in survival probabilities (Stone and Fletcher,
1986; Fries, 1980; Manton, 1982; Olshansky and Ault, 1986; Olshansky et
al., 1990; Olshansky and Carnes, 1994;
Crimmins et al., 1994). It has also been
indicated that men and women in their
middle ages have made notable gains
in survival (Levi, 1981; Myers, 1989;
Rothenberg and Koplan, 1990; Olshansky and Carnes, 1994).

Therefore, most of the observed
narrowing .in the sex gap across the
twelve nations in Table 1 may turn out
to be a function of decreasing sex differences in mortality at the older ages
and possibly within the interval be
- tween the young adulthood years and

retirement age. It is also possible that a
narrowing in life expectancy at age
zero may result as a function of relatively larger male reductions in infant
mortality over the time interval being
considered. Clearly, if this last condition is a factor, it would preclude gender role type explanations for the phenomenon being investigated.

In Table 4, we show three equations
involving the dependent variable regressed on the change in male/female
age-specific death rates between the
early 1970’s and the early 1990’s. In
comparison to the previous analysis,
the number of countries is reduced to
33 (as opposed to 38) due to unavailability of appropriate data concerning

Life Expectancy 29

age-sex-specific death rates for five nations in Table 1. In Equation (2), we
substitute the death rate for age 60+
with that corresponding to 85+ in order to assess better the possible importance of change in the sex mortality difference in old age mortality on the
narrowing of the sex differential in life
expectancy at age zero.3

As in our preceding analyses, we
rely on OLS regression, and the interpretation of parameters is made in relation to the nation as the unit of analysis. Thus, a given coefficient measures
the relative effect of male/female differences in the amount of change in
age-specific death rates (per 1,000 population) on the dependent variable,
thus allowing us to answer the substantive question of which age group or
groups show the strongest association
with the dependent variable. A positive coefficient would indicate that the
age-specific difference in the rate of
change in death rate between men and
women is related to a divergence in the
male/female difference in life expectancy at age zero, which is the same as
saying that males in comparison to females in a given age class have made
relatively lower improvements over
time in reducing their mortality risk. A
negative coefficient would indicate that
the effect of a differential rate of
change in age-specific mortality serves
to reduce the sex gap in life expectation
over time, and that therefore men
would be making larger improvements

3Out of the 38 countries listed in Table 1, five
nations (Albania, Northern Ireland, Romania,
Scotland, and USSR) had to be excluded from this
part of the analysis because data on death rates by
age groups were unavailable in the data sources.

From Equation (1) in Table 4, the

two age classes may account for the
phenomenon under investigation: age
groups 25-59, and 60+. Equation (2)
gives further indication that age 85+ is
not statistically significant in its contribution to variance explained in the dependent variable. The multivariate results, however, show that it is mainly
male/female differences in the amount
of change in death risk within the ages
of 25 to 59 which accounts for most
of the explained variations in male/
female change in life expectancy at

age zero. The effect of the 25-59 sex
mortality differential is to reduce the
sex gap in life expectancy by —0.705 on
average (or by —0.78) in standard
units). Stated differently, since the
early part of the 1970’s, the effect of
men’s relatively greater improvements
in mortality within the age class of
25-59 serves to reduce significantly the
sex gap in longevity across nations in
this analysis.

Given the overlap between the age
groups of 60+ and 85+ , we decided to
delete the former age class and include
the latter in a separate equation to assess better the relative effect of change
in gender-specific death rates in old
age to the phenomenon under investigation. As it turns out, there is only a
marginal additional influence of this
predictor to the change in male/female
differences in life expectancy across
countries (b = —0.000; B = —0.02). It
is clear, however, that this is a minor
effect in relation to the impact of age
class 25-59, which now in this last
equation shows an increased contribution over the previous one
(6 = —0.742, B = —0.82). In fact, the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

changing sex mortality differential
within this age group alone accounts
for 67 per cent of the variance in the
dependent variable (total variance explained is 72 per cent).

It appears that a significant part of
the observed convergence in the gender gap in longevity in recent decades
can be accounted for by the differential
speed at which the sexes have been reducing their respective mortality rates
within the young adulthood to latemiddle-age span; that is, between ages
25 and 59. This is the age range within
which industrial nations vary significantly in explaining the narrowing of
sex variance in survival: Countries
where males in this age range have
made faster gains in reducing their
death risk in comparison to females experience a larger degree of convergence in the survival gap than in those
nations where males have been less
successful in making mortality improvements within the age range of
25-59,

A question worth posing is whether
across countries the male/female difference in age-specific rates of mortality reductions vary by level of GNP.
Table 5 concerns itself with three bivariate regressions involving three different measures of GNP as predictors
of the male/female change in agespecific death rates over time. As displayed in the table, country variations
in GNP explain a relatively small part
of the sex difference in the rate of
change in age-specific mortality. This
finding is true irrespective of whether
GNP is measured at the beginning of
the study period or at the end. The
only case where GNP seems to make
any real difference is in connection
with the explanation of sex differences

 

 

Life Expectancy 31

in death rates in the age group 25-59,
where the amount of variance explained ranges from 19 per cent in the
period around 1970, to 51 per cent in
the later period; and 41 per cent of the
variability is explained if the predictor
is the temporal change in GNP (i.e.,
LN(GNP, 12/ GNP, f1).

The results indicate that for 25-59
year olds, the effect of raising GNP
would serve to decrease men’s death
rates faster than those of females
within this age range (b = 0.833 and
0.793 at time points one and two, respectively). Moreover, a rise in a nation’s GNP over time is associated with
greater benefits for men in reducing
mortality risk (b = 0.984). The data
also indicate that if nations had relatively high levels of GNP at the beginning of the study period, men aged 60
and older would experience larger declines in mortality in relation to women
(b = 2.342, r= 0.29). On the other
hand, the opposite is suggested among
those aged 85+, where male gains
have occurred at a slower pace
(6 = —10.38, r= —0.26); however,
these last two effects are only marginally significant in statistical terms
(p < 0.10).

CONCLUSIONS

Since the early 1970’s or so, the industrialized world has witnessed the
beginning of an unprecedented narrowing of the long-established sex differential in survival. When exactly this
trend began is not possible to identify
as some countries started earlier and
some later, but it is clear that around
the early part of the 1970’s, some nations were approaching an apex in their
sex gaps in longevity, and by the early

1990’s, twelve societies had experienced varying degrees of convergence.
Some of these countries have reduced
their gender gaps in survival at age zero
by as much as 1.85 years (Hong Kong),
while others by as low as 0.02 of a year
(e.g., Switzerland). In another set of
nations, situated mostly in Western
Europe, but also Israel and Japan, the
male/female difference in longevity
has not yet reached a point of convergence, but this may not be very far in
the future. Unfortunately, there is a
third group of countries, situated
mainly in Eastern Europe, where the
male disadvantage in the average
length of life has actually widened by
as much as two to almost three years
(e.g., Albania, Romania, Hungary).
The substantive reasons for this phenomenon in this part of the industrialized world need to be explored systematically in subsequent research. Our
observations suggest that an important
basis for this development is crossnational discrepancies in level of social
and economic development, as mea
sured by GNP. How exactly country
differences in GNP translate in a reduction in the sex gap in survival in
some nations, while in others it translates into’ divergence 1n this differential, remains a question worthy of further empirical exploration.

An important finding in this analysis
pertains to the contribution of temporal change in age-sex-specific differences in death rates across nations to
the changing sex gap in survival. Our
results indicate that a significant portion of the change in male/female survival differences is due to changing
death rates in the age group 25-59.
The larger the male improvement in
this age range in terms of mortality reductions, the larger a country’s degree
of convergence in its sex gap in life expectation. We found little support for
the proposition that much of this convergence would result from changing
sex mortality differences in the very
young (i.e., age 0-14) and in old age
(i.e., ages 60+). In fact, there appears
to be no statistical association linking

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

change in sex differences in mortality
rates among 0-14 year olds to the dependent variable; and there emerged
only a weak and marginally significant
contribution of such differential at ages
60 and above. Of course, this finding
does not in any way refute the fact that
within many industrialized nations old
age mortality has improved. Indeed,
there is evidence that this is the case
(Manton, 1982; Nagnur, 1990; Myers,
1989; Olshansky and Ault, 1986; Olshansky et al., 1991; Krishnan, 1992).
What we are saying is that the differences across countries with respect to
sex variation in mortality in old age do
not appear to be statistically relevant in
explaining a narrowing of the sex gap
in survival at age zero across industrialized societies.

What implications can be drawn
from our results? Earlier, we advanced
the notion that recently the industrialized world may have entered a new

phase of epidemiological evolution.

This proposition will undoubtedly receive further attention, but at this
point it is clear that for a significant
number of industrialized nations there
is now evidence of a reversal in the
long-established trend in the sex differential in survival. This situation seems
to be permanent and is not likely the
result of data errors. The phenomenon
has occurred in some of the most
advanced nations of the world, which
are known to possess excellent vital
statistics registration and systems of
data collection. This phenomenon has
taken place in not one or two countries, but in at least twelve, making it
difficult to accept the hypothesis that
the observed development is solely a
function of vagaries in the data. In the

Life Expectancy 33

next several decades more industrial
nations will likely witness the onset of
convergence in the sex gap in life expectancy.

It appears that several demographic
and epidemiological conditions must
prevail for an advanced society to witness a narrowing of its gender differential in survival: (1) The society must
have completed its demographic and
epidemiological transitions as specified
in the classic statements of these theories (cf., Omran, 1971). (2) The nation
must be either within or about to embark on its fourth stage of epidemiological evolution as delineated by
Olshansky and Ault (1986). (3) The
country must have already attained relatively high levels of life expectancy,
particularly among females, such that
women within the society are fast approaching a plateau in terms of further
potential gains in life expectation (cf.,
Fries, 1980; Olshansky et al., 1990).
(4) There must be a high level of female emancipation, as reflected in such
trends as their high rates of higher
education, labor force participation,
prolonged level of low or belowreplacement fertility, rising age at marriage, increased propensities to enter
common-law unions, and high divorce
probabilities. (5) There must have occurred in the recent past some convergence in gender-based behaviors,
which in many cases would be highly
associated with female emancipation.

These conditions are either implicitly or explicitly assumed, in some of
the recent literature on sex differences
in mortality. For example, researchers
have hypothesized that as women increase their levels of labor force participation toward those of men and

approximate the same occupational
distribution, they will begin to experience similar patterns of mortality (Waldron, 1990; Pampel and Zimmer, 1989;
Passannante and Nathanson, 1985;
Hazuda et al., 1986; Bouvier-Colle,
1983). Others have added that in recent decades women have been increasingly taking on “masculine” roles
and, as such, may soon start to approximate a correspondingly “masculine”
configuration. of death (Gee and
Veevers, 1983; Veevers and Gee, 1986;
Waldron, 1993). Furthermore, it has
been argued that the sex gap in death
rates has begun to narrow in the industrialized world partly due to women’s
adoption of several behaviors which
have contributed to men’s higher mortality in the past. The rise of smoking
among women and the concomitant reduction of tobacco use among men
during the past few decades is an example of this trend (Nathanson, 1992).
Women may also be consuming more
alcohol than in previous times. Also,
with their increased independence and
affordability due to their labor force
participation, women are driving more
and hence more likely to be involved in
fatal motor vehicle accidents (Veevers
and Gee, 1976).

In societies where these trends have
been prevailing a minimum value for
the sex differential in life expectancy at
age zero should eventually attain.
What that minimum difference will be
and when it will take place is open to
speculation, however. We surmise that
women will always enjoy one to two
additional years of life expectancy over
males; and it would seem highly unlikely that men will ever attain parity
with women. Even in high mortality
conditions, such as during the early

 

Social Biology

stages of epidemiological transition,
when society was relatively devoid of
good systems of health care and had
relatively low standards of living, the
differential in life expectation favored
women by about two to three years.
This assertion can be verified in part by
the Coale and Demeny (1983) model
life tables at the highest mortality levels, where indeed the sex gap in life expectancy at infancy is in this vicinity. It
would seem likely that a two to three
year gap may represent a natural lower
limit for the amount of eventual convergence in the male/female gap in longevity.

Our analysis suggests that if the prevailing rates of convergence in the
twelve nations identified in this research remain constant over time, two
countries can expect their sex gaps in
longevity to reach this presumed minimum difference within the next four
decades. Those countries are Hong
Kong and Iceland. For the remaining
ten nations, this outcome will necessarily take longer due to their presently
lower levels of convergence. Further
work in the area of mortality projections will have to take into account this
new reality and appropriate parameters for the sex gap in longevity will
have to be introduced into the computations.

From a theoretical point of view, the
evidence presented in this study is not
inconsistent with the thesis proposed
by Rogers and Hackenberg (1991).
They argue that the industrialized nations of the world have in recent years
entered the “Hybristic” stage of epidemiological transition, whereby the
morbidity and mortality patterns of
men and women are now largely a
function of individual behaviors and
 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

Vol. 43, No. 1-2

life styles. The rise of HIV/AIDS,
which has affected mostly men, but is
now spreading rapidly among women,
and the increased consumption of alcohol and other substances such as
tobacco and illicit drugs attest to the
importance of personal choice in explaining much of today’s morbidity
patterns (Waldron, 1993).

The beginning of convergence in the
sex gap in longevity in some industrialized countries may be partly associated with these kinds of developments
in the social worlds of men and women.
Some indication that this may be true is
provided by our finding that a significant portion of the phenomenon we investigated is a function of the mortality
conditions prevailing in the age range
between 25 and 59, which represents
the ages mostly affected by major life
style changes in contemporary society
during the past 20 to 30 years. Thus,
the recent gains in male survival in
comparison to females, albeit modest
in most cases, may be linked to convergence in behaviors among the
sexes, such as the relative rise of cigarette smoking among women and the
concomitant declines in such behaviors
among men, possibly resulting in differential rates of mortality from major
killers such as lung cancer (Waldron,
1993).

Life Expectancy 35

Unfortunately, we could not assess
this proposition in a more direct way
due to lack of appropriate data and
age-sex-cause specific mortality rates
for all the nations in this investigation
over the time period involved. This remains an important area of further
investigation. Further study is needed
to develop a more complete picture of
the interrelationships between changing individual behaviors among the
sexes, changes in gender differences in
morbidity, cause-specific death rates,
and convergence in male/female life
expectancy. A detailed analysis of the
age-specific components of change in
male and female life expectation by
cause of death will provide important
insight in this regard. Further insight
will also be gained by executing the
same analysis for societies in which
the sex gap in longevity has been diverging.
