Since this paper was written, some articles
that relate to this topic have appeared or are
in press now and have been brought to our
attention. James (1971) has shown that in the
one gene model with one threshold, the correlations between relatives depend only on three
parameters. Both the single gene model studied
by Elston and Campbell (1970) and the model
we used require four parameters for complete
specification. This leaves a range of equally
valid solutions, among which general incidence
and incidence among various types of relatives
are identical. The range is, however, restricted
by the fact that gene frequencies and penetrances outside the range 0-1 are unacceptable.

In the case of schizophrenia, the restriction
thus imposed limits the range of possible solutions to gene frequencies between approximately 0.06 and 0.15. In this range all solutions are equally acceptable. Thus, a single
gene two allele model can fit the data. If a
single locus is involved, the gene frequency
must be in the neighborhood of g=0.10 (with
range 0.06-0.15 by James’ approach). A very
similar range of solutions was found with our
search procedure and is indicated in Tables 2
and 3 of this paper.

Two aspects of some interest resulted from
the comparison of these approaches. The first |
is that, while James used only the parentoffspring correlation, his conclusions can be
extended to the case in which specific types of
matings are considered, eg., N XN, N XS,
and S X S as we have done. The second is that
the two formulations of the single gene model
(ours based on liability distribution and James’
using scores of O for normal and 1 for disease)
give rise to different heritability estimates. Our
formulation allows direct calculation of the
additive and dominance components of variance for the underlying liability for each acceptable solution. Over the range of these
solutions the variance components vary, and
consequently the heritability estimates vary.
The A? (narrow) values range from less than
4% to slightly over 15%, while the A? (wide)
values range only from approximately 11% to
approximately 17%. In contrast, the invariant
heritability estimates based on application of
Kempthorne’s formulae (see James, 1971) are
near 8% for h? (narrow) and near 40% for
h? (wide).

Reich, James, and Morris (1972) have developed a two threshold method that may

allow unique solutions for the single-diallelicgene model on traits in which the affected are
subdivided into two degrees of severity. It
may help in distinguishing between the polygenic and the one gene, two allele model. Obviously, the two thresholds must be sufficiently
sharp to allow accurate diagnosis. However,
with two thresholds, a three-allele model and
a two-diallelic-loci model may still leave a
probably wide range of ambiguity.

Smith (1971) has given a method and a
program for predicting risks in matings according to the polygenic hypothesis, This is an
alternative method to those we have introduced: Monte Carlo and direct evaluation of
the tetrachoric correlation. The relative cost in
computer time to obtain equal accuracy for the
two methods has not been determined. Numerical integration with a small number of intervals in Smith’s program may be unsatisfactory

when incidences are small. The graphs relating
incidence and correlation given by Smith
(1970) and by Reich et al. (1972) are virtually identical to results obtained using the
original tetrachoric correlation expansion to 50
terms (Kidd and Cavalli-Sforza, unpublished)
although the illustrations they give are either
limited to or only accurate for general incidences below 20%.
