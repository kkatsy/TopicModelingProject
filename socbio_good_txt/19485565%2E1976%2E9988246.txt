ABSTRACT: Ethnic differentials in neonatal and postneonatal mortality in a birth cohort of
Spanish surname, white (non-Spanish), and nonwhite infants in Houston, Texas, were analyzed
with legitimacy status, mother’s age, birth order, and birth weight controlled separately and
simultaneously. In the presence of all factors, Spanish surname and non-Spanish white infants
had a neonatal mortality risk about 13 per cent below average; nonwhite (primarily Black)
infants, 30 per cent above average. Adjusted for all four factors, the risk for nonwhites was 8 per
cent below average and for Spanish surname infants 2 per cent below average, while it rose to
almost $ per cent above average for non-Spanish white infants. Birth weight and legitimacy status
were responsible for most of the change. The four factors had less effect on postneonatal

mortality, with legitimacy status seeming to have the greatest influence.

The decline in infant mortality in the
United States has been one of the notable
health accomplishments in this century.
The rate of decline, however, has not been
uniform for all racial and ethnic groups.
Numerous studies have been conducted to
document ethnic differentials in infant
mortality. These studies have shown that
nonwhite babies have a higher risk of
dying than do their white counterparts
(Shapiro et al., 1965; Shah and Abbey,
1971; Scurletis et al., 1973). While the
white-nonwhite differentials have been
widely documented, few studies have
given attention to the Mexican-American
group, a major ethnic group in the Southwest.

The vast majority of the research on
infant mortality has been more descriptive
than analytic. Although descriptive studies are important in order to examine patterns of disease and mortality trends (Fox
et al., 1970), more analytic studies are
needed to understand the patterns and

trends better. Many studies have indicated
that infant mortality is associated with
each of the following social and demographic factors: low birth weight; very
young and very old mothers; the first order
birth and very high order births; and illegitimacy (Chase, 1969; Erhardt et al.,
1970; Chase and Erhardt, 1973; Burris,
1974). The most common analytic procedure to study these relations has been
standardization or  cross-classification.
Unfortunately, this strategy has been severely hampered by practical limitations.
The number of observations is usually too
small to permit the separation of the effects of any more than two or three factors. Alternative analytic procedures employed in some studies include correlation,
analysis of covariance and multiple regression (Wells et al., 1958; Cochran,
1957; Feldstein, 1966).

This study examines ethnic differentials
in neonatal and postneonatal mortality
among three ethnic groups: Spanish sur

name, white (other than Spanish surname), and nonwhite (virtually all
Blacks). In our analysis the effects of various social and demographic factors are
controlled separately and simultaneously
by means of a binary variable multiple
regression method. This study analyzes infant deaths in a birth cohort rather than
infant deaths and live births that occurred
in a calendar year.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The basic data source for this study is
the birth and infant death certificate information for the years 1958-60 obtained
from the Houston Health Department. Infant death certificates were matched with
their birth certificates so that variables
from both records might be utilized. The
birth cohort analyzed in this study comprises single live-born infants in Houston,
Texas, born to Houston residents during
the years 1958 and 1959. Plural births are
excluded since additional factors are involved in mortality associated with these
births. The total population size of this
study included 46,320 single live births. A
total of 118 live births were excluded because of erroneous or missing information
for certain items.

The major limitation of our data is the
omission of infant deaths among the
1958-59 birth cohort that were registered
outside of Houston (infant deaths among
out-migrants). This omission poses less of
a problem for neonatal mortality than for
postneonatal mortality. Although it is very
difficult to assess the magnitude of this
problem directly, an examination of unmatched infant deaths (infant deaths
among in-migrants) may provide an indirect indication. Since Houston is a rapidly
growing city, the number of infant deaths
among out-migrants is believed to be
smaller than the unmatched infant deaths.
Only 4.2 per cent of resident infant deaths
registered in Houston during the study

Gee et al.

Social Biology

period could not be matched with births
(2.9 per cent for neonatal and 8.6 per cent
for postneonatal deaths). The percentage
of unmatched infant deaths was about the
same for all three ethnic groups (3.2 per
cent for Spanish surnames, 4.4 per cent for
other whites, and 4.1 per cent for nonwhites). This finding suggests that the
omission of deaths among out-migrants
would not significantly affect ethnic differentials observed in this study, although
the overall mortality rate is slightly underestimated.

Identification of Spanish surnames was
achieved by means of a computer scan of
surnames on certificates. The computer
program was originally developed by
Buechley (1961). It identifies over 95 per
cent of all Spanish surnames as Spanish
and only 2 per cent of non-Spanish names
as Spanish (Jackson and Buechley, 1972).
Although the computer approach obviously does not give results equivalent to
the census bureau’s hand-coding procedure, it is satisfactory for the present study
since census figures are not used to compute rates. The more important question is
whether the Spanish surname criterion
is satisfactory in identifying MexicanAmericans in Houston. While the problems of using a Spanish surname criterion
are discussed extensively elsewhere (Hernandez et al., 1973), there is no other procedure available for use with existing vital
statistics data. Information on birthplace
of parents could be utilized in conjunction
with the Spanish surname criterion, but
unfortunately such information was not
available in our data file.

Quantitative information on completeness of vital registration for the study period is not available. The nationwide tests
of completeness conducted with the 1950
census showed that Houston’s registration
of white births was 99.2 per cent complete
while nonwhite births were 98.2 per cent
complete (U.S. Public Health Service,

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 23, No. 4

1955). It is believed that the completeness
of death registration was equally good or
even better than birth registration. Further improvement might have been accomplished by 1958, a major reason for
the improvement being the increasing
proportion of births occurring in a hospital
(Spiegelman, 1970). The proportion of
births taking place in hospitals in Houston
increased from 96 per cent in 1950 to 98
per cent in 1959 (City of Houston Health
Department, 1959).

In this study, neonatal and postneonatal
mortality are considered the dependent
variables. The neonatal period is defined
as the first 27 days of life, and the postneonatal period covers ages 28 days and
over but less than one year. These dependent variables are compared among three
ethnic groups with adjustments for the effects of other influential variables. The
ethnic groups along with other influential
factors are considered the independent
variables. The following four factors are
considered:

1. Legitimacy status. Two categories are
considered: legitimate births, illegitimate
births.

2. Age of mother. Five groups are formulated: less than 20, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35
and older,

3. Birth order. Five categories are used
(considering live births only): first order, second order, third order, fourth order, and
fifth and higher orders.

4. Birth weight. Since weight is reported in
pounds and ounces on birth certificates, and
over seven ounces is rounded up to the next
pound, only three categories are considered:
less than 5.5 pounds, greater than or equal to
5.5 pounds, and unknown birth weight.

A binary variable multiple regression
technique utilized by Feldstein (1966) is
employed to analyze the data in this study.
The purpose of using this technique is to
ascertain the expected increases or decreases in the dependent’ variables
(neonatal and postneonatal mortality) in
each ethnic group when adjustments are

Neonatal and Postneonatal Mortality

319

made for various combinations of the
other independent variables under study.
In other words, by using this particular
analytic technique, the relationship of the
ethnic groups to infant mortality may be
examined in the absence of the effects of
other influential factors. Since the multiple regression technique is an additive
procedure, many simultaneous adjustments may be made for the effects of various factors influencing neonatal and postneonatal mortality.

In this binary variable regression method, each independent variable, instead of
representing the overall effect of a factor
(maternal age, for example), will represent
a single subclass of a factor (for instance,
maternal age 20—24), taking the value one
if an observation falls into that subclass
and zero otherwise. Similarly, the dependent variable will be assigned a one if the
infant dies and a zero if the infant survives
the first year of life. Use of this method
does not require any assumptions about
the forms of the relations of the dependent
and independent variables. It is assumed
that there is no interaction between the
effects of the factors included in the equation (Suits, 1957; Shah and Abbey, 1971;
Feldstein, 1966; Melichar, 1965)

The least square estimates of the regression coefficients are used for computing the percentage deviations from the expected value of the dependent variable.
The deviation expressed in percentages
measures the excess or deficit mortality
associated with being in a particular subclass of a factor. Detailed computational
procedures of adjusted percentage deviation and associated standard error have
been given by Feldstein (1966).

RESULTS

Percentage deviations from the mean
neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates
were computed for each ethnic group. The
gross effects are adjusted for various
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

320

combinations of the other independent
variables. These unadjusted and adjusted
percentage deviations can be interpreted
in a similar manner as standardized rates.
It should be noted that the adjustment for
all factors simultaneously includes only
the factors under consideration in this
study. Other variables which were not
taken into account may have some influence on the results.

NEONATAL MORTALITY

Among the 1958-59 birth cohort in
Houston, Texas, there were 914 neonatal
deaths. Based on a total of 46,320 single
births during this period, the mean
neonatal mortality rate was 19.7 per

Social Biology

1,000. Percentage deviations are measured
from this value.

Table 1 shows the effects of adjustments
for various combinations of factors in the
study on ethnic groups, along with the
approximate magnitude of standard errors. The unadjusted deviations show that
Spanish surname infants and white (nonSpanish surname) infants have about the
same chance of dying during the neonatal
period, 12.7 and 13.8 per cent below average respectively, and nonwhite infants
have the highest chance, 32.3 per cent
above average. However, when adjustments are made for all factors under consideration, the results are changed. Nonwhite infants have the least risk of dying,

8.4 per cent below average, while white
infants now have the highest chance of
mortality, 4.5 per cent above average.
Spanish surname infants have a percentage deviation of 2.5 per cent below average in the absence of the effects of all other
factors.

When adjustments were made for only
one factor, the absence of the birth weight
effect caused the greatest increase in the
white and Spanish surname percentage
deviations. White deviations increased
from 13.8 per cent below average to 0.3
per cent below average; and Spanish surname deviations increased from 12.7 per
cent below average to 0.7 per cent below
average. The absence of the effect of birth
weight dramatically improved the nonwhite infant’s chances of survival during
the neonatal period, suggesting that low
birth weight among nonwhite babies is
mainly responsible for the excess neonatal
mortality among nonwhites. Next to birth
weight, legitimacy status was another influential factor associated with neonatal
mortality. The absence of the effect of this
factor resulted in higher risks for white
and Spanish surname infants. However,
both these risks remained below average.
Although nonwhite infants continue to
have an above-average risk of neonatal
mortality in the absence of the legitimacy
status effect, the unadjusted risk was reduced by 25 per cent.

The adjustment for birth order resulted
in lowering the Spanish surname infants’
risk of neonatal mortality to almost 14 per
cent below average and the nonwhite infant risk to 30.9 per cent above average.
The birth order adjustment increased the
risk of white infants from 13.8 per cent
below average to 12.9 per cent below
average.

Mother’s age was the one factor adjustment that had the least effect upon the
risks of the different ethnic groups. The
absence of this factor increased the risk of

Neonatal and Postneonatal Mortality

 

321

white infants by approximately 4 per cent.
It decreased the risk of nonwhite infants 3
per cent. The risk for Spanish surname
infants stayed approximately the same
after this adjustment.

As might be expected, the two-factor
adjustment causing the greatest change in
the unadjusted percentage deviations was
the legitimacy status—birth weight combination. With this adjustment, risk of
neonatal mortality for white infants increased to 1.6 per cent above average. Infants with a Spanish surname had about
an average risk of death during the
neonatal period when the effects of legitimacy status and birth weight were adjusted. The nonwhite deviation was reduced to 3.4 per cent below average with
this adjustment.

The lowest risk obtained by the Spanish
surname infants was in the absence of the
effects of mother’s age and birth order.
The risk of Spanish surname infants, 14.6
per cent below average, was lower than
both the white and the nonwhite risks.

For all three factor adjustments,
Spanish surname infants had a belowaverage risk of dying during the neonatal
period. However, the lowest deviation occurred in the presence of birth weight. The
white risk of death during the first 27 days
of life remained above average for every
three-factor adjustment except the legitimacy status—mother’s age—birth order adjustment. The presence of the effect of
birth weight resulted in the highest risk
obtained by using three-factor adjustments on the nonwhite group.

POSTNEONATAL MORTALITY

Among the 1958-59 birth cohort in
Houston, Texas, there were 337 postneonatal deaths. Since the total number of
births during this period was 46,320, the
mean postneonatal mortality rate was 7.28
per 1,000. Percentage deviations are measured from this value. This method of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

322

computing postneonatal mortality rates is
used by the National Center for Health
Statistics (Grove and Hetzel, 1968). By
using this particular computation, the sum
of the neonatal and postneonatal mortality
rates will be the infant mortality rate. It
should be noted that this method fails to
take into account the fact that infants
whose lives end in neonatal death in reality no longer belong to the population at
risk of postneonatal mortality.

Table 2 shows the effects on ethnic
groups of adjustments for various combinations of factors in the study. It is noted
that there are more ethnic variations in
postneonatal mortality than in neonatal
mortality. In general, all explanatory factors considered in this study have much

Social Biology

less effect on ethnic differentials in postneonatal mortality than in neonatal mortality examined above.

In the presence of all factors, nonwhite
infants had the highest risk of dying of the
three ethnic groups during the postneonatal period. Spanish surname infants
had a 29 per cent deviation above the
mean postneonatal mortality rate, while
whites had the lowest risk of dying during
the period, 49 per cent below average.
After adjustments were made for all factors considered, nonwhites still had the
highest risk and whites the lowest risk of
dying after the first 27 days of life. Total
adjustments did little to effect the Spanish
surname risk of dying. However, in the
absence of other factors in the study, the

nonwhite percentage deviation was reduced by 40 per cent—from 91 per cent
above average to 55 per cent above average. The risk of white infants in the absence of all other factors in the study was
increased from 49.4 per cent below average to 31.4 per cent below average.

When adjustments were made for only
one factor, legitimacy status seemed to be
having the greatest influence on ethnic differentials. The percentage deviation of
nonwhite infants dropped to 77.7 per cent
above average in the absence of the effect
of legitimacy status. The absence of
legitimacy status caused the white infants
and the Spanish surname infants to have
more unfavorable percentage deviations
than did the absence of any other single
factor. The adjustment for mother’s age
seemed to have the least effect on all three
ethnic groups. Of all the one-factor adjustments, the absence of the birth order
effect allowed the Spanish surname group
to achieve its most favorable percentage
deviation of 23.2 per cent above average
risk.

When adjustments for different combinations of two factors were made, more
favorable percentage deviations from
average risk emerged for nonwhites and
Spanish surname infants. The adjustment
reducing the nonwhite rate to its lowest
value in the absence of two factors was for
legitimacy and birth order. The interdependency of legitimacy status and birth
order had a greater influence in reducing
the deviation than did the interdependency of the two most important single adjustments—legitimacy and_ birth
weight. Of all adjustments made, the adjustment causing the most reduction to the
Spanish surname percentage deviation
was mother’s age and birth order. These
same two factors were the most important
single adjustments for this ethnic group.
The most favorable two-factor adjustment
for the white group was mother’s age and

Neonatal and Postneonatal Mortality

 

323

birth weight. However, this percentage
deviation, 45.3 per cent below average,
was higher than the unadjusted deviation
of 49.4 per cent below average.

In the absence of the effects of three
factors, nonwhite infants emerged with
a lower percentage deviation than in
the previous adjustments. This occurred
when adjustments were made for all factors except birth weight. Thus, legitimacy
status, mother’s age, and birth order adjustments caused a greater reduction in
percentage deviations than did a combination of the three most important single
adjustments—legitimacy status, birth
weight, and birth order. The interdependency of mother’s age with birth order and
legitimacy status was more important than
any of the two-factor combinations of
these three variables. Of all the threefactor adjustments, the adjustment of all
factors except legitimacy status caused the
most reduction in the Spanish surname
ethnic group. This finding is not surprising, since the absence of legitimacy status
caused the Spanish surname deviation to
increase more than in the absence of any
other factor.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This study investigated neonatal and
postneonatal mortality differentials among
three ethnic groups based on infant death
registration records matched with their
birth registration records. Particular attention was given to the examination of
changing ethnic differentials among three
ethnic groups in the presence of all factors
and in the absence of four sociodemographic factors. In the presence of all factors, both Spanish surname and nonSpanish white infants exhibit about a 13
per cent below average risk of neonatal
mortality and the risk for nonwhites
(primarily Blacks) is more than 30 per cent
above the average risk. In the absence of

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

324

the effects of four factors, however, the
Black—non-Black differential reverses.
When adjustments were made for all four
factors, Blacks had an 8 per cent below
average risk and Spanish surname infants
continued to have a below average risk,
while non-Spanish white infants had almost a 5 per cent above average risk of
neonatal mortality. Of the four sociodemographic factors, birth weight and
legitimacy status were responsible for
most of the changing differentials when
statistical adjustments were made. Similar
results between whites and nonwhites
were obtained by Shah and Abbey (1966)
in their investigation of neonatal mortality
in Baltimore.

There were more ethnic differentials in
postneonatal mortality than in neonatal
mortality. Four explanatory factors considered in this study have much less effect
on ethnic differentials in postneonatal
mortality than in neonatal mortality, suggesting that environmental factors not examined in this study are intervening after
27 days of an infant’s life. Unadjusted differentials in postneonatal mortality pictured Black infants as having the highest
risk (91 per cent above average), Spanish
surname infants with the intermediate
level of risk (29 per cent above average),
and non-Spanish white infants with the
lowest risk (49 per cent below average).
The four factors examined do not have
any effects on postneonatal mortality for
Spanish surname infants, while they have

Social Biology

some influence for non-Spanish white and
nonwhite infants. Of the four factors,
legitimacy status seems to be having the
greatest influence on ethnic differentials in
postneonatal mortality.

An unexpected finding in this study is
that the Spanish surname neonatal mortality level, despite the group’s much less
favorable socioeconomic conditions, resembles the Anglo experience rather than
the Black experience. Further, the unexpectedly low neonatal mortality among
Spanish surname births appears to be attributable to their more favorable birth
weight distribution and full-term gestation
period. Further research is needed, especially focusing on certain sociocultural
factors associated with the MexicanAmerican family system which might encourage better care of mothers and children. On the other hand, the Spanish surname postneonatal mortality level is
higher than that of Anglos, but still substantially lower than that of Blacks, which
seems to reflect the influence of socioeconomic environment, nutrition, and access
to health care
