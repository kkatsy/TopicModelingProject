An Exploratory Technique for Measuring
Fertility Norms

ABSTRACT: In an attempt to remedy inherent weaknesses in traditional methods of fertility norm
measurement, the evaluative dimension of the semantic differential is used to measure such norms
among college women at two Southern universities. The instrument was designed to gauge the
covert evaluative response elicited in people who observe behaviors relevant to norms which they
have internalized. Variations in evaluations of hypothetical couples representing the parities zero
through seven are associated with the race, religious preference, religiosity, and future work
orientations of respondents. The significance of differences in the relative configurations of norms
is determined by a special model of analysis of variance, and subgroups are compared with
respect to the intensity of the norms they hold.

Among the approaches employed to
explain fertility behavior, probably none
has been granted more credence than the
social norm perspective. Ronald Freedman notes:

How many children a couple should have is
a problem so widely shared and so important
in every society that it would be a sociological anomaly if normative cultural solutions
were not developed to meet this problem in
most cases (1961-62, p. 29).

To date, however, researchers have
done little to demonstrate that the normative approach constitutes a fruitful avenue
of explanation and prediction. Consensus
on the meaning of “norm” relative to fertility behavior and adequate techniques
for measurement are lacking. This paper
discusses an exploratory method for fertility norm measurement and presents data
illustrating the use of this technique in a
select population.

PREVIOUS APPROACHES

A myriad of definitions of “norm” have
been formulated (Gibbs, 1965). Within the

149

literature, there is agreement that norms
are prescriptions and proscriptions for behavior; still, it is unclear whether these
must be accompanied by social sanctions.
For example, Morris writes:

... norms are generally accepted, sanctioned
prescriptions for, or prohibitions against,
others’ behavior, beliefs, or feelings, i.e.,
what others ought to do, believe, feel—or
else . . . . Norms always include sanctions
(1956, p. 10).

Newcomb, on the other hand, defines
norms only as “shared frames of reference
which make communication possible”
(1950, p. 291).

Unless sanctions are essential to conceptualization, norms become difficult to distinguish from collective agreement about
what actions are practical, judicious, aesthetically pleasing, and the like. But incorporating sanctions within the definition
doesn’t necessarily solve problems encountered in previous research.

The frequency of certain behaviors,
statements of appropriate conduct, and
the observation of sanctioning have all

150

been used as indicators of norms (Nadel,
1957, p. 25). We contend that issues of
validity have not been treated adequately
in such work.

Regarding the first approach, there is
indeed much consensus on how many
children people in various settings have.
Such parity patterns may be the outcome
of normative pressures. However, Easterlin (1959) has noted that similar incomes,
tastes, and prices, for example, can also
create identical fertility outcomes, quite
apart from normative expectations. A
more general criticism of using consensus
behavior to indicate norms is one of logical
circularity. Behavioral regularities are observed; from these, norms are inferred;
and then, the inferred norms are used to
“explain” the original behaviors (Dreeben,
1967).

Asking respondents what constitutes
proper fertility behavior evokes questions
about the meaning of responses. Ryder
and Westoff (1969) and, more recently,
Rindfuss (1973) assert that such queries
have not clearly specified the context or
referent of proper fertility behavior. In
addition, these questions ignore enforcement altogether. Finally, this approach
requires that individuals be able to give
accurate descriptions of norms that impinge upon them,! and be willing to do so
as well.

The measurement of fertility norms
through observation of sanctioning is similarly problematic. A parity level is a
prolonged state of being rather than an act
or event of short duration. Thus, sanctions
could be imposed at any time during this
temporal expanse, making it difficult for
the observer to separate them from sanc
1 That individuals may be incapable of describing
norms does not mean that their behavior is free from
normative influence. For example, verbal behavior is
surely reflective of rules of grammar even though
many people could, at best, give a crude summary of
those rules. Fertility norms may also be difficult for
many to describe.

tions for other actions that actors have
taken. Sanctions may be administered in
essentially private settings or even covertly by the actor himself if he has internalized the norm. Further, there is no assurance that members of the audience
would consistently impose _ sanctions.
Strangers, for example, rarely sanction
others’ misbehaving children in public;
perhaps only individuals with particular
role relations with the individuals in question would impose sanctions in response to
fertility behavior. Lastly, there is a danger
that any desirable or undesirable consequence of an act will be perceived by the
observer as a sanction. Yet, in the
literature, only those consequences which
follow an act by virtue of social
convention, rather than as a direct result
of the act itself, may be considered sanctions.

Given the problems associated with the
above approaches to measurement, there
seems to be a need for developing an alternative measurement procedure. Such an
alternative is possible if we assume that (1)
some members of a social group have internalized a norm and that (2) these individuals will react covertly (and, perhaps,
overtly as well) as they witness actors
engaging in norm-relevant behavior. The
reaction would, in part, consist of judgments regarding the social worth and virtue of the actor—judgments the observer
creates in an attempt to account for behavior in terms of (un)desirable personality
traits, underlying motives, or the basic
character of the actor. The more closely
the behavior approximates the normative
ideal (from the observer’s view), the more
favorable the covert response should be.

THE SEMANTIC DIFFERENTIAL AND
FERTILITY NORMS

Few social science techniques exist for
detecting feelings which subjects are

unable and/or unwilling to reveal. Fewer
still are amenable to survey research applications, but the semantic differential is
one projective technique which holds
promise as a method of tapping normative
phenomena.?

The semantic differential requires that
respondents rate stimuli (typically,
single-word nouns) along a series of scales
linking polar adjectives. For example, a
subject might be asked to place an “X” to
indicate the semantic position of the stimulus DOCTOR on each of a series of scales
divided into seven segments. The paired
adjectives “honest-dishonest,” “sensitiveinsensitive,” etc., would denote the extreme values of such semantic scales.
Scores indicating the position of each “X”
placed on these scales would be factor analyzed, and the meaning attributed to a
stimulus would be reduced to a smaller
number of dimensions underlying the
separate scales. These dimensions, or factors, which actually would be clusters of
highly intercorrelated adjectival scales,
would be given substantive interpretation
by the researcher on the basis of denotative content common to the scales within
each cluster.

In numerous applications, three dimensions of meaning have emerged from
the use of the semantic differential: the
evaluation dimension, defined by such adjectival scales as “good-bad”; the activity
dimension, defined by scales such as
“fast-slow”; and the potency dimension,
defined by such polar adjectives as
“strong-weak.” If the semantic differential
can be used to measure fertility norms,
factor analysis of adjectival scale scores
will generate an evaluative dimension or
factor, the magnitude of which would

2 Well over 1,500 applications of the semantic differential have been documented in the social science
literature (Snider and Osgood, 1969), but to our
knowledge no one else has sought to create a
methodological/conceptual link between this technique and normative phenomena.

vary across parity levels. This approach
would allow measurement of covert feeling? and would avoid dependence on consensus behavior or observation of overt
sanctioning to detect norms.

A full-scale assessment of the utility of
the semantic differential technique for the
detection of fertility norms would need to
take into account three things:

1. Respondent characteristics. Though
one may postulate the existence of an American fertility norm, it is probably more
realistic to envision a composite of different
norms held by various subgroups. The
present study is limited to investigating the
impact of a few major social characteristics
found, in other work, to be related to fertility: race, religiosity, religious preference,
and future work orientation of the respondent. Obviously, additional respondent
characteristics might be related to normative
standards.

2. Fertility levels. The stimuli to which
respondents react should cover a _ broad
range of human fertility. However, one
could extrapolate to higher parities on the
basis of response to lower levels. One could
also interpolate to parity levels not presented
in the stimuli on the basis of response to
jevels that bracket the missing values. We
have limited the stimuli to the parity levels 0
through 7—levels within which a vast majority of American families fall.

3. Contingent characteristics. Many norms
are status- or situational-specific, i.e.,
what is expected of one is contingent upon
the statuses one occupies and upon pertinent
personal/contextual characteristics. Socioeconomic status, for example, would quite
likely be taken into account by respondents
reacting normatively to the fertility behavior
of a particular couple. Hence, in addition to
fertility, the stimuli used, ideally, should
vary as well by such characteristics of the
childbearing couple as income and education.

In addition to permitting the researcher to
identify those actor characteristics which
might influence normative judgments, the
contingent characteristics serve another purpose. The fertility variable would be imbedded within a field of social variables, and
the intent of the researcher (to measure fer
3 The contention that covert response is being
tapped is admittedly tenuous due to the relative
nonambiguity of the stimuli and instructions. Only
the inclusion of a variety of adjectival scales serves to
disguise the intent of the researchers.

152

tility norms) would be less obtrusive, thereby
strengthening the assertion that covert response was being measured with a projective
technique.

Unfortunately, with this advantage comes
a liability. The addition of contingent variables would greatly increase the number of
stimuli needed to measure normative response. If only three dichotomous contingent
variables were introduced, eight different
stimuli (2 X 2 X 2) would be necessary to
measure response to each parity level. Thus,
eight parity levels would necessitate sixtyfour distinct stimuli. This amount of complexity in data collection was deemed by the
researchers to be inadvisable in an exploratory study. Hence, no contingent characteristics were employed.

ILLUSTRATIVE DATA

In order to explore the usefulness of this
technique for measuring fertility norms,
questionnaires were mailed to simple
random samples of one thousand Florida
State University female students and four
hundred Florida A and M University female students during May of 1970.
Completed questionnaires were received
from 835 of the original 1,400. While not
intended to be representative of any larger
population, comparisons of sample characteristics with known population parameters at these schools failed to reveal
response bias among FSU students;
FAMU response was somewhat overrepresentative of students with higher college
class standing.

All respondents were given the following instructions:

“In everyday situations we often make
judgments about other people and what they
are like on the basis of a small amount of
information. It is the purpose of this section
of the study to measure the judgments made
of married couples on the basis of the number of children they have had. On the following pages, hypothetical couples and the
number of children they have had are listed.
Imagine that in each case the couple has had
the number of children they desire to have.
You are to rate each couple on a series of
scales that are listed beneath them. A first
impression or immediate feeling about what

the couple might be like is the response we
wish to measure.”

There were additional instructions on
the marking of the adjectival scales, followed by eight couple stimuli (e.g., Couple
A: no children) whose fertility ranged from
none to seven children. Twelve adjectival
scales followed each stimulus.4

The scores from these eight sets of
twelve scales were factor analyzed, using a
principal components solution and an orthogonal rotation. Diagonal elements used
for communality estimation were set first
at unity and then at the maximum absolute row value in the correlation matrix.
The orthogonal rotation was chosen to
replicate the production of independent
factors generally extracted from the
semantic differential. Also, unlike oblique
rotation, this procedure yields information
concerning the amount of judgmental
variance explained by the factors derived.
The summary results of this analysis are
contained in Table 1.

Three factors provided the best solution; rotation of a fourth factor explained
only another 2 per cent of the variance.
Rotation of three factors also produced
maximum congruence across fertility
levels of scales which had high loadings on
the three factors.

Final scores on each dimension were
computed as a simple summation of the
raw scores on the three adjectival scales
having the highest mean loadings on the
respective factors across the eight fertility
levels. For example, on Factor I, the
scales “considerate-inconsiderate,” “fairunfair,” and “selfish-unselfish” had
consistently high loadings. The factor
underlying these scales appears to be the
evaluative factor identified by Osgood and
his associates (1957).

Likewise, on Factor II, the three scales

* These twelve scales, from thirty-four examined
in a pretest, were retained for their ability to elicit

consistent responses capable of producing identifiable dimensions via factor analysis.

respond meaningfully to the stimuli along such scales
as “hot-cold,” “slow-fast,” and “small-large.” In one
sense, that concern is academic since the intent of the
researchers was to imbed a few evaluative adjectival
scales within a variety of other scales, thereby creating a more ambiguous response situation. At any
rate, it is interesting to note that response to
nonevaluative scales was “meaningful” in some way
since identifiable dimensions of potency and activity
emerged when the scales were factor analyzed, and
these dimensions were related to fertility. In short,
response was not random or meaningless (see Henley, 1970). Similar results pertaining to role enactments have been reported elsewhere (Friedman and
Gladden, 1964).

* Significant at the 0 001 level

Although the shape of the norm profile
depicted in Figure 1 confirms the view
that moderate-size families are normatively more acceptable than either large or
small ones, a caution is in order. The differences in the mean evaluative scores
across parity levels is small compared to
the potential range from three to twentyone. At first, this might seem to indicate
consensus concerning low intensity fertility expectations, i.e., that most respondents perceive no severe norm violations
or highly approved conformities at any
parity. However, the presence of considerable variance in scores around each of
the evaluative means counters this reasoning. Instead, the presence of some extreme
evaluative scores at the various parity
levels may indicate that different norm
profiles exist for subgroups within the total
sample. This reasoning can be explored by
disaggregating the sample along four respondent variables: race, future occupational plans, religiosity, and religious preference.

Summaries of the analyses of variance
performed using evaluative scores, fertility levels, and the four respondent variables are contained in Table 3. In each
case, the F-ratios produced by the
between-people analyses indicate the degree to which grand means of evaluative
scores differ from one subgroup to an
on one variable across different treatments, was employed (Winer, 1962, pp. 105-139, 298-378).

the case of the racial subgroups, for example, grand evaluative means for whites
and nonwhites are significantly different;
Figure 2 reveals that the nonwhite grand
mean is higher.

The F-ratios for the interaction terms
are indicators of the degree to which subgroups had norm profiles significantly dissimilar in shape from one another. Thus,
the interaction term keys on the relative
positions of points along one profile versus
another. Even though the nonwhite grand
mean exceeds that for the white subgroup,
the F-ratio indicates that the curves are
not significantly dissimilar, i.e., it cannot
be demonstrated that the curves are not
parallel to each other in the populations

from which these samples were drawn.
For subgroups defined by the other three
variables, the findings are different; in
each case, the interaction term is significant at the 0.01 or 0.001 level.

In essence, the subgroup analyses demonstrate that the total sample contains categories of people having normative expectations that are significantly different from
one another in average intensity as well as
in shape. This finding explains in part why
there was considerable variation in evaluative scores at each parity level for the
total sample.

Additional support for the claim that
these profiles represent normative expectations was found in examining respondents’ desired fertility. No other variable
examined in this study was as accurate a
predictor of each respondent’s fertility desires as the parity level which received her
highest evaluation. Moreover, the predictive capacity of the highest evaluated
parity either remained constant or increased when controls for race, religious
preference, religiosity, or future work
plans were introduced.

DISCUSSION

Despite encouraging findings, some
problems remain. In very few instances do
any of the norm profiles cross over into the
presumably negative range of evaluation.
Since the possible range of scores on the
evaluative dimension is from three to
twenty-one, it seems reasonable to assume
that the median point of twelve represents
evaluative neutrality.’ Additionally, the

7 Convention identifies the midpoint as semantic
neutrality. Using only the semantic differential, the
researcher really has no way of verifying, nor can
he demonstrate, that all the respondents perceive the
seven segments in each scale to be of equal length.

Henley and Gustavus

Social Biology

amount of variance in evaluations accounted for by the four respondent variables and the fertility variable was relatively low. A number of explanations may
be directed toward these problems.

Methodological constraints include the
selection of a test population from college
campuses. Such persons may be less willing than average citizens to negatively
evaluate persons on the basis of their fertility. Secondly, the range of fertility behavior presented in the instrument was
truncated, and extending the trend lines of
evaluations suggests that negative evaluations would have been observed in many
cases at higher parities.

It may also be that evaluations are
idiosyncratically volatile, though the aggregate values are near neutrality. Such a
view would be consonant with demographic transition notions picturing fertility norms in flux and hence not solidly
grounded in morality at this time.

Finally, the analyses performed here did
not include many variables that probably
are important. No characteristics other
than fertility were used to describe the
stimuli. Also, a number of respondent
characteristics, such as SES or marital
status, were not controlled.

What is promising about this approach
is its ability to yield significantly different
evaluations of fertility which can be examined in a variety of graphic and statistical
ways. At the same time, the data are free
of the contaminating sources that usually
accompany norm measurement.

Therefore, unless information independent of the
semantic differential is introduced, the identification
of semantic neutrality must remain indeterminate.

We found evidence that semantic neutrality was
higher than the evaluative score of twelve. Fortythree per cent of the respondents indicated some
willingness to impose mild negative sanctions on
one-child couples, and fifty-three per cent were similarly disposed toward couples with six children. Both
of these parities received evaluative scores about
twelve.
