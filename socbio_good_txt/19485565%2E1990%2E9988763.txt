Interruption of Breastfeeding
by Child Death and Pregnancy

ABSTRACT: This paper estimates the mean monthly losses and proportionate interruptions of
breastfeeding intervals due to child death and pregnancy. The paper uses a microanalytic
model with stochastic risks for the basic processes of human reproduction. The model results
show that a high proportion of women, depending upon mortality level and length of
breastfeeding, have their breastfeeding interrupted by either child death or pregnancy. The
results of this work suggest the need for caution in interpreting observed durations of
breastfeeding. Child death and pregnancy causes bias in the reported length of breastfeeding,
and this bias needs to be taken into account in statistical analysis.

This paper examines the relationship
between the observed duration of
breastfeeding, considering interruptions by pregnancy and early child
death, and the length of breastfeeding
that would have occurred without interruptions. Breastfeeding data are usually
derived from mothers’ reports on either
their open breastfeeding interval or the
last closed breastfeeding interval.

Both types of reports have known biases for estimating the mean length of
breastfeeding in a population: (1) Including only the interval since Jast birth
(an open interval) tends to select longer
intervals and biases the mean breastfeeding duration upward. (2) Including
only the interval since last birth (an open
interval) tends to select longer intervals
and biases the mean breastfeeding duration upward. (2) Including only women
who have completed their last breastfeeding interval (a closed interval) increases the probability of shorter breastfeeding durations and biases the mean
breastfeeding duration downward. Jain
and Bongaarts (1981, Footnote 3), however, provide procedures for making un
biased estimates of breastfeeding duration for data on open breastfeeding
intervals.

Besides the biases mentioned above,
there are biases due to truncation in the
observed duration of breastfeeding. The
two major sources of truncation are the
death of the child while breastfeeding
(and thus the involuntary cessation of
breastfeeding) and pregnancy (and thus
the voluntary cessation of breastfeeding
in a short period after learning of the
pregnancy). While researchers are
aware of these measurement issues,
standard statistical descriptions of
breastfeeding intervals do not always
take the truncation biases into account.
Moreover, researchers have lacked estimates of the impact of early child death
and pregnancy on breastfeeding intervals for various levels of mortality and
breastfeeding duration. Estimates provided in this paper suggest that truncation biases for reported breastfeeding
duration can be large.

This paper reviews microanalytic
techniques for modeling the risk of child
death and pregnancy following child

birth, incorporates these risks into a microsimulation model of human reproduction, and estimates the losses of
breastfeeding by “‘model length of
breastfeeding.’’ We use the phrase
“model length of breastfeeding” here to
mean the hypothetical duration of
breastfeeding if there were no interruptions of breastfeeding due to child death
or pregnancy. Toward these goals, the
paper presents a stochastic model of human reproduction with breastfeeding,
pregnancy, and child death specified as
model parameters. The results of this
model include estimates of the mean
monthly losses and proportionate interruptions of “model breastfeeding durations” by child death and pregnancy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
MICROANALYTIC MopEL

Louis Henry (1972) made the first efforts, in the 1950’s, to develop statistical
models of human reproduction. Later,
Perrin and Sheps (1964) considered a
stochastic model in continuous time
with five states—fecund, pregnant, fetal
loss, stillbirth, and live birth. Sheps and
Menken (1973) summarize early research in their comprehensive, coherent
survey of mathematical issues in the
study of human reproduction. At a certain point, however, in working with
probability models of human reproduction, the mathematics become intractable and simulation procedures are often
used to explore the relationships
(Keyfitz, 1968, pp. 397-398). Since the
work of Perrin and Sheps (1964), researchers have primarily depended
upon simulation for the estimation of
the probability models, with Perrin and
Sheps (1964), Hyrenius and Adolfsson
(1964), and Hyrenius et al. (1966) con

tributing early simulation models of human reproduction. More recently,
Watkins et al. (1987) have broadened
the realm of statistical modeling and undertaken extensive simulations involving the formation of families.

The microanalytic model used here
builds on prior work by Barrett (1971),
Barrett and Brass (1974), Barrett
(1978), Brass and Barrett (1978), Barrett (1981), and incorporates prior work
with this model by Edmonston and
Smith (1982) and Edmonston (1983). In
the prior model, major events of human
reproduction were represented for a hypothetical population. This paper’s
analysis chooses parameter values for a
variety of mortality and breastfeeding
patterns that encompass typical levels in
developing countries and, like prior
work with this model, does not attempt
to model any specific population.

Two key features are included in this
model that add to the previous work.
First, the risk of resumption of postpartum ovulation explicitly depends upon
the duration of breastfeeding. Second,
the risk of infant and child death affects
the interruption of breastfeeding if the
child dies. To our knowledge, this is the
first microanalytic simulation model of
human reproduction that estimates the
effects of breastfeeding-dependent
postpartum ovulation and the impact of
child death on breastfeeding.

The conditions of this model are biological and do not rely on any specific assumptions of social and cultural factors.
These factors may, however, affect human reproduction through the biological variables. For example, we initially
assume that women interrupt breastfeeding at the moment of conception. A
revised estimate, given in the final section of the paper, then assumes a lag between individual knowledge of pregDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

nancy (which probably varies between
individuals and between cultures) and
the cessation of breastfeeding.

Events of human reproduction are
represented individually in this model.
The reproductive process of a cohort of
women proceeds, for one woman at a
time, by moving the individual from the
beginning of reproduction (we assume
that all women begin reproduction at
the same age for this model) to the end
of the reproductive span of life. The primary biological assumptions of this
model include: (1) Conception is a
chance event, with the interval to conception depending upon a random variable with a beta probability distribution.
(2) Each pregnancy is terminated by a
fetal death, stillbirth, or live birth with
the outcome probabilities dependent
upon a woman’s age. (3) Each pregnancy is followed by a nonsusceptible
period, a postpartum anovulatory period that depends upon the duration of
breastfeeding. (4) Each woman eventually becomes sterile, and some women
are infecund at the beginning of their reproductive career. (5) The reproductive
process begins again if a woman is fecund at the end of the nonsusceptible
period.

Selected parameters of the model
may vary between women, and some
parameters may vary by age, parity, and
other factors. Each woman moves
through her reproductive span in intervals of one lunar month (there are 13 lunar months per calendar year in all estimates shown in this paper),
experiencing a sequential set of reproductive events.

Time to Conception.—Nonsterile
women are characterized by a fecundability function in which fecundity varies
by woman and with a woman’s age. The
variation in fecundity, p, is described by

235

a beta distribution:

fip) = _ Ppl pep

pt} (1 —p)’} dp

ie

where a-3 and b= 13 gives a reasonable
fit for human fecundability (Barrett,
1971). This beta distribution provides a
statistical description of fecundity for
women between age 20 and 30 years,
with a mean fecundability of 0.1875 per
monthly cycle that varies between
women. For women under 20 years, the
model assumes that fecundity increases
linearly from menarche until age 20,
when fecundity becomes equal to the
value provided by the beta distribution.
For women over 30 years of age, it is assumed that fecundity declines linearly
until menopause, when fecundity becomes zero,

Pregnancy.—Three outcome states
are possible for a pregnant woman: fetal
death, stillbirth, and live birth. The
probabilities of these three outcomes
are 0.24, 0.03, and 0.73, respectively
(Barrett, 1971). Fetal deaths and stillbirths are assumed to increase linearly
with a woman’s age after 30 years of age
(Edmonston and Smith, 1982) and, asa
result, the probability of live birth declines after age 30 years. Fetal deaths
are geometrically distributed by month
of gestation, following documentation
of fetal deaths in Kauai, Hawaii (French
and Bierman, 1952).

Postpartum Anovulation.—An interval of nonsusceptibility follows the end
of pregnancy. The model takes the interval to be 2 months for fetal deaths and
3 months for stillbirths. Previous microanalytic models have usually specified
nonsusceptibility following live birth as
a Pascal distribution, where nonsusceptibility is the sum of two consecutive

geometrically distributed random delays (Potter et al. , 1973). The model presented here develops along a new direction by incorporating a model schedule
of anovulation that depends upon the
duration of breastfeeding. Beginning
with early work by Potter et al. (1965)
and Jain et al. (1970), demographic research has studied the impact of the
length of lactation on the period of postpartum amenorrhea, both as a substantive relation and a problem in statistical
modeling. Bongaarts and Potter (1983)
and Habicht et al. (1985) summarize research on the relation of breastfeeding
and postpartum amenorrhea.

We have converted the model of
postpartum anovulation logits of Lesthaege and Page (1980) to lunar months
(published in Edmonston and Smith,
1982, Table 1), and made the logit values depend upon the hypothetical duration of breastfeeding. That is, the model
specifies a hypothetical length of breastfeeding for the population (a hypothetical length that is desired for all women
and for each live birth) and then derives
a distribution of postpartum anovulation that varies by live birth and between
women. To calculate the monthly
schedule of menstruation resumption,
we take the model length of breastfeeding, which we assume to be equal to the
median length of breastfeeding, M, and
solve for two parameters, a and B:

a = —2.757 + 0.1833M-0.00238M?
~o/B = —1.5013a—0.2756a2

where these relationships are reported
in Lesthaege and Page (1980, p. 161).
Then, knowing a and 6, one can estimate from a logit model the probabilities of menstruation resumption in the
month following childbirth, Y(d), as

¥(d) = a+BY,(d)

Social Biology

where Y,(d) is the standard schedule of
postpartum amenorrhea, also expressed
logit values.

It should be noted that the work by
Lesthaege and Page (1980) relied on
prospective postpartum amenorrhea
data from Guatemala to provide a
standard schedule of menstruation resumption, by months, following childbirth. They then scaled the logits of the
standard schedule in order to model the
relation of breastfeeding length to postpartum amenorrhea interval for other
populations. Ford and Kim (1987), ina
critical analysis of Lesthaege and Page’s
work, note that the Guatemalan standard schedule does not seem to fit correctly the shape of the postpartum
schedule for Bangladeshi women, given
the length of breastfeeding for those
women. Ford and Kim provide an alternative standard, using Bangladeshi
data. Our results use the original Lesthaege and Page (1980) data and, thus,
given the work of Ford and Kim (1987),
should be seen as modeling the shape of
the postpartum amenorrhea for Guatemalan women. It should be emphasized,
however, that only the shape is assumed
for Guatemalan women, and that the
monthly probabilities of menstruation
resumption depend upon the length of
breastfeeding.

During the period of breastfeeding, a
woman cannot become pregnant while
in the anovulatory state. If a breastfeeding woman resumes ovulation, then the
time to conception is a probability function, the same as described earlier. Only
when a breastfeeding woman resumes
ovulation and becomes pregnant does
she cease to breastfeed before the end of
her model breastfeeding.

Women in some populations abstain
from sexual activity while breastfeeding. Abstinence would remove the like

Vol. 37, No. 3-4

lihood of pregnancy, even if the women
resumed ovulation. The model reported
here does not include any association
between breastfeeding and abstinence
because available information on the relationship of breastfeeding and abstinence is scarce. Data for Hausa women
in Africa, who breastfeed for two years
or more, suggest that about one-third of
breastfeeding Hausa women abstain
from sexual intercourse while breastfeeding (Rehau and Adashiya, 1981).
The mean duration of abstinence for abstaining Hausa women is 21 months. For
the two-thirds of Hausa women who resume sexual activity while breastfeeding, the median length of abstinence is
about 6 months. Populations with a
significant proportion of women who
abstain from sexual activity while
breastfeeding would reduce the proportion of breastfeeding intervals that are
interrupted by pregnancy. Our model
does not provide estimates of this effect
however.

Infant and Child Mortality.—
Following work on the Weibull distribution (Edmonston, 1982), we model infant and child mortality here in terms of
a probability of a live birth surviving to
month x as /(x), where /{x) follows a
Weibull distribution:

x = exp (~ax’)

Interruption of Breastfeeding

 

237

We choose Weibull parameters, a and
b, from the United Nations model life
table system (United Nations, 1982), using the published life tables for the Latin
American region. Table 1 displays the
life table parameters for both sexes combined and the Weibull parameters arranged by level of life expectancy at
birth. The United Nations life table system includes five sets of regional life tables: Latin American, Chilean, South
Asian, Far Eastern, and General. We
select the Latin American life tables for
work here because the model breastfeeding schedules are derived from a
Guatemalan study group, a Latin
American population. Comparing the
fit of the United Nations’ Latin American model life tables for life expectancy
at birth of 55 years, we note that the various observed regional probabilities of
surviving to age 1 are within 4 per cent of
the model life table, and the probabilities of surviving to age 5 are within 3 per
cent of the model life table (except for
the Far Eastern pattern, which shows
about 7 per cent more births surviving to
age 5). This suggests, for purposes here,
that using a different regional life table
system would result in, at most, about a
3 or 4 per cent difference in the probability of a child dying in the early years of
life. Compared with life expectancy at

birth of 55 years, this per cent difference
diminishes for longer life expectancy
and increases for shorter life expectancy.

After the birth of a child, uniform
random numbers are generated to determine the age of death of the child. If
the child dies before 65 lunar months (5
years of age), then a random number is
generated in order to select a length of
postpartum anovulation from this
model schedule, given the model duration of breastfeeding. If the child dies after the time of postpartum anovulation,
then the child’s death would have had
no effect on postpartum ovulation, although it would interrupt the mother’s
breastfeeding. If, on the other hand, the
child dies before the onset of ovulation,
then the woman ceases breastfeeding
which may shorten the period until ovulation resumes. If a child dies during a
woman’s nonsusceptible period, the
model assumes two consecutive geometrically distributed delays with parameters of 0.5 per lunar month. When a
woman resumes ovulation, she is at risk
of pregnancy. When a woman becomes
pregnant, the model ascertains if she is
still breastfeeding and, if so, calculates
the amount of interrupted breastfeeding.

Sterility.—The sterility of a couple in
a sexual union Is represented entirely by
the sterility of the woman. Sterility is the
earlier of two variables for a woman.
The first variable is the woman’s age at
menopause, selected by a beta distribution from tabular data of menopause between 38 and 54 years of life. The distribution follows the model developed by
Hyrenius et al. (1966) from Swedish
data.

The second variable represents sterility occurring before age-related menopause. With this sterility, risk begins at

Social Biology

exact age 28 and assumes a linear increase in the risk of sterility. The model
gives no explicit consideration to
surgically-produced (operative) menopause, which is an increasing source of
menopause in low mortality population
and is significant even in some high mortality countries, where medical personnel encourages women to have tubal ligation for contraceptive purposes.

The combination of this second pattern of sterility, coupled with an esttmated 4.8 per cent of couples who are
Sterile at the onset of reproduction,
results in a pattern of childlessness simtlar to that reported by married Irish
couples in 1911 (Barrett, 1971). The
result of these factors is a mean age of
sterility of 43 years.

Recent work suggests modest improvements might be made in the stochastic modeling of sterility, although
the present model does not include
these changes. Trussell and Wilson
(1985) have reanalyzed several sterility
data sets and suggested revisions in the
original Barrett (1971) model. Larsen
and Menken (1989) measured sterility
by age from incomplete birth histories in
several African countries. They note
variations for African populations both
above and below those estimated for
Europe. For simulations of human reproduction for sub-Saharan African
populations, where venereal disease
and female circumcision increases the
incidence of sterility by age, the model
would need to be altered to include
these higher levels of sterility. The
results in this paper, however, do not
depend critically upon the sterility assumptions and, hence, do not include
varying levels and patterns of sterility by
age.

Contraceptive Use.—The model does
not incorporate contraceptive use.

Vol. 37, No. 3-4

There are a considerable number of
studies that investigate the association
of breastfeeding, contraceptive use, and
amenorrhea (see Laukaran and Winikoff, 1985 for a research on this topic).
Individual and national-level data show
a strong correlation between breastfeeding and duration of amenorrhea
(Smith, 1985), but associations with
contraceptive use (and, hence, on the
likelihood of conception) have been
more difficult to establish. Current research suggests that there 1s a negative
association between amenorrhea and
contraceptive use in developing countries. This suggests that breastfeeding
women, many of whom are amenorrheic, are not highly motivated to use
contraception. Future work, with better
data on contraceptive use, might model
breastfeeding interruptions with varying
levels of contraceptive use.

We have written the microanalytic
model described above in ANSI 77
FORTRAN, compiled the program using Microsoft’s FORTRAN compiler
(Microsoft Corporation, 1990), and carried out it for execution on a microcomputer. A simulation of 1,000 women
takes about 20 minutes on microcomputer equipped with an 80386 processor
and a numeric coprocessor.

RESULTS

The results show five Jevels of mortality: life expectancy at birth for both
sexes combined of 35, 45, 55, 65, and 75
years. Table 1 displays the Weibull parameters for infant and child mortality
corresponding to these five mortality
levels. The results also include five levels of model breastfeeding duration: 6,
12, 18, 24, and 30 lunar months. For
results for each of these 5 by 5, or 25 categories, the reproductive behavior of

239

1,000 women is simulated. This yields
between 5,588 and 10,721 breastfeeding
intervals, depending upon the particular
category of mortality and model breastfeeding duration, as the basis for reporting breastfeeding interruptions (see Table 2).

Table 2 displays the number of
breastfeeding intervals, by level of life
expectancy at birth and model length of
breastfeeding, for the 25 simulation runs
of 1,000 women in each simulation. The
table also shows the proportion of
breastfeeding intervals interrupted by
child death, pregnancy, and the combination of child death and pregnancy. Table 3 provides information on the observed length of breastfeeding with
interruptions by child death and pregnancy. The table also shows the monthly
losses in breastfeeding due to either
child death or pregnancy. The following
sections, with accompanying graphs, interpret these results.

Figure 1 shows results for the proportion of breastfeeding intervals that are
interrupted by child death and pregnancy. In general, a high proportion of
breastfeeding is interrupted by child
death or pregnancy. Our estimates
range from a low of 25 per cent of
breastfeeding intervals interrupted
when mortality is low and breastfeeding
duration is short to 63 per cent when
mortality is high and breastfeeding duration is long. For the average developing country in Latin America, for example, where overall life expectancy at
birth is about 60 years and women
breastfeed for about 12 to 18 months,
the model shows that one-half of the observed breastfeeding intervals are inter

rupted by either child death or pregnancy.

Breastfeeding is interrupted by the
coincidental occurrence of child death
and pregnancy in the same month in a
few cases. These joint coincidences are
unusual and are included in the total interruptions, but are not distinguished as
an interruption due to either child death
or pregnancy separately.

The proportion of breastfeeding intervals interrupted by child death (see
Figure 2) varies with the level of mortality. Under 5 per cent of intervals are interrupted when mortality is low, but be
tween 16 per cent and more are
interrupted when there is high mortality. In conditions of high mortality and
prolonged breastfeeding, more than
one-fourth of breastfeeding intervals
are interrupted by child death.
Interruptions due to pregnancy (see
Figure 3) do not vary by mortality level,
but primarily depend upon the duration
of model breastfeeding. About 15 to 20
per cent of breastfeeding intervals are
interrupted by pregnancy when model
breastfeeding is short (about 6 months).
For model breastfeeding duration of 1
year or more, these results show that

Fic. 6.—Monthly losses in breastfeeding due to interruption by pregnancy

where life expectancy at birth equals 55
years. The most sizeable impact of the
particular month of pregnancy that a
woman ceases breastfeeding is for a
model breastfeeding duration of 6
months. If women do not interrupt their

breastfeeding until 3 or more months after conception, then few women breastfeeding for 6 months would cease because of pregnancy. For longer
breastfeeding durations, fewer women
interrupt breastfeeding because of the

influence of the specific month of pregnancy that they choose for the cessation.

Another way of examining the influence of the month of pregnancy on
breastfeeding interruptions is to suppose that women do not interrupt their
breastfeeding until at least 3 months of

pregnancy. Under these circumstances,
Table 5 presents the proportion of
women who interrupt their breastfeeding, compared with earlier results for
women who interrupt during the month
of conception. Delayed interruption
during pregnancy influences the proportion interrupting their breastfeeding,
but a sizeable proportion of women continue to interrupt their breastfeeding for
the longer breastfeeding durations,
even if they delay the interruption until
at least the third month of pregnancy.

pectancy at birth is about 60 years and
where women breastfeed for about 12 to
18 months, the model shows that onehalf of the observed breastfeeding intervals are interrupted by the combination
of child death and pregnancy. Thus,
generally, a high proportion of breastfeeding intervals end before the hypothetical duration of breastfeeding.

These results also provide information about the difference between the
observed or reported duration of breastfeeding and the hypothetical or model
length of breastfeeding. For a population with life expectancy at birth of 60
years and a model breastfeeding duration of 12 to 18 months, about one
month is lost to child death and roughly
two months are lost to pregnancy (see
Table 3 estimates). Therefore, about 20
per cent of the model breastfeeding is
not observed because of these two interruptions.

These results emphasize the caution
required in analyzing observed durations of breastfeeding. They especially
serve to introduce a cautionary note
about comparing the observed length of
breastfeeding when mortality varies,
and hence biases the reported durations
of breastfeeding. For example, suppose
a researcher collects data on breastfeed

ing durations by level of female education and, further suppose, that the
model duration of breastfeeding varies
between 12 months for better-educated
women and 18 months for less-educated
women, a difference of 6 months between the educational extremes. We
might further assume that bettereducated women have a life expectancy
of 65 years and less-educated women
have 55 years. Then, Table 3 shows that
better-educated women would report
9.7 months of breastfeeding and lesseducated women would report 13.1
months, a reported difference of 3.4
months. Because childhood mortality is
also associated with female education,
the reported durations of breastfeeding
diminished by over two months. With
marked variations in mortality and
model length of breastfeeding, it would
be possible to collect data on reported
breastfeeding duration in which the reported data failed to show differences in
breastfeeding duration, when differences existed.

From the perspective of temporal
changes in breastfeeding, the net effect
of child death and pregnancy interruptions on reported breastfeeding durations serves to diminish a hypothetical
trend in shorter breastfeeding duration.
It is better-educated women in many developing countries who decrease their
duration of breastfeeding, and yet the
reported data would underestimate the
diminution of breastfeeding among
better-educated women with lower
mortality.

These results also suggest that there
is an interaction of effects between reported breastfeeding duration and contraceptive practice. Populations with
higher rates of contraceptive use or sexual abstinence are more likely to have
reported breastfeeding durations closer
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:43 08 December 2015

Vol. 37, No. 3-4

to the model breastfeeding length.
Again, the nature of contraceptive practice in developing countries, with
greater contraceptive use among more
educated women, acts to attenuate the
difference in reported breastfeeding.

In summary, the results of this model
demonstrate the potential biases in retrospective reporting of breastfeeding
duration. There is no single answer
about how to handle retrospective data
for simple statistical description. At a
minimum, however, data collection
should include information on child
death and pregnancy interruptions of
breastfeeding, and then exclude these
breastfeeding interruptions for descriptive comparisons of breastfeeding durations. For multivariate explanations of
breastfeeding duration, statistical
models are available that permit explicit
specification of censorship of breastfeeding by child death and pregnancy
(Cox and Oakes, 1986). Statistical
methods for survival models are one obvious approach for demographic analysis of breastfeeding data, and recent
published work shows an increasing
number of papers that include these
measurement problems in the survival
analysis.

The results reported here use several
mortality levels for Latin American regional life tables and several durations
of breastfeeding for a Guatemalan
model schedule of postpartum amenorrhea. Although the key substantive im
Interruption of Breastfeeding 249

pacts of child death and pregnancy interruptions of breastfeeding pertain to any
study of breastfeeding duration, the
specific numeric interpretations should
be limited to Latin American populations. Further work might analyze the
model results for different regional life
table groups and different age schedules
of postpartum amenorrhea. Finally, the
present model uses an age pattern for
the incidence of sterility that differs
from that reported for sub-Saharan African populations. Future research
might also investigate results of the
model with varying levels of sterility
by age.
