ABSTRACT; Genetic variability among seven Chilean Indian populations (Aymara, Atacamefio,
Diaguita, Pehuenche, Mapuche, Alacaluf, and Yagan) is measured in terms of net codon differences per locus from gene frequency data on seven serologic markers. Indices of cultural and
linguistic differences are computed surveying the various ethnographic accounts of these tribal
populations. Of the variables, culture, language, geography, and the degree of Caucasoid admixture, only geography seems to be the important factor in explaining the variabilities in
genetic distances among these populations. An empirical relationship between geographic dis
tance and gene identity is also established and shown graphically.

The comparative ethnography of South
American Indian tribes has been described
at length in the multivolume publication
called the Handbook of South American
Indians (Steward, 1963). On the other
hand, studies related to biological diversity
as measured by anthropometric and serologic traits are scattered, even when they
are extensive. Furthermore, only for a few
tribes is biological variability related to
ethnographic history through a formal
analysis (Salzano, 1968; Neel et al., 1972).

In this paper, the genetic diversity
among seven Chilean Indian tribes has been
studied through an analysis of seven serologic markers. Since these tribes are known
to have admixed with Caucasoids in varying degrees and thereby have gone through
a great deal of cultural transformation, the
dependence of genetic variability on geographic distance, on the extent of Caucasoid admixture, and on cultural and lin
guistic dissimilarities is explored through
a regression analysis,

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The seven Chilean Indian tribes considered for the present analysis are: Aymara (17°S, 70°W), Atacamefio (23°S,
67°W), Diaguita (22°30’S, 63°42’W), Pehuenche (38°S, 71°30°W), Mapuche (38°
S, 72°30’°W), Alacaluf (50°S, 75°W), and
Yagan (55°36’S, 70°48’W). They all belong to the so-called “highland” Andean
populations. Several of these tribes are
quite well spread in their geographic habitations, and the latitudes and longitudes
shown above are the approximate locations
from which the samples were obtained.
Furthermore, the Diaguita sample actually
comes from northwestern Argentina from
which this tribe expanded to Chile during
pre-Inca times with an already developed
culture (Bennett, 1963; Lothrop, 1963;

per locus, varies from 24 to 30 per cent
(not shown in the table).

Simple inspection of these genetic distance values indicates that there is a general trend of migration from north to south,
although a few exceptions do exist (eg.,
Atacamefios are the closest to Alacalufs).
Using these genetic distance values, Sneath
and Sokal’s (1973) clustering procedure
resulted in the dendogram shown in Figure
1. This dendogram indicates that except for
the Atacamefios and the Alacalufs the remaining tribes form a cluster below the
level of an absolute distance of 0.02 codon
differences per locus. This finding is comparable with our earlier findings (Blanco
and Chakraborty, 1975) where some ex

planations for this exception have been indicated.

Cultural variability: Andean culture has
been the subject of a vast literature
(Steward, 1963). However, quantitative
analysis of cultural dissimilarities of the
different tribes is far from being complete.
Of course, difficulties in obtaining uniform
criteria and an unambiguous classification
make such studies quite subjective. In our
analysis, the cultural attributes were taken
from the comparative study of Driver and
Massey (1957), and the broad classification was drawn from the descriptions given
in the Handbook of South American Indians (Vols, 1 and 2, Steward, 1963).

comparative studies which is the basis of
the cultural dissimilarity matrix shown in
Table 1 (lower diagonal entries). Numeric
values were assigned to each attribute
representing a gradation in the degree of
acculturation (e.g., for the attribute “clothing and body ornamentation,” the numeric
values for the seven tribes are 4, 3, 2, 1, 1,
Q, and 0, respectively, in the order they
appear in the table). Absolute differences
of these numeric values for each of the
attributes were computed, and the sum represents the total cultural dissimilarities between the two tribes concerned. The values
were then standardized by dividing each of
them by the maximum (which is 39, corresponding to the cultural dissimilarity
between the Aymaras and the Yagans).

Cultural descriptions given here, however, refer to the entire group of populations living in South America. Thus, the
Aymaras of the cultural classification matrix (Table 2) include the Aymara populations of Chile, Bolivia, and Peru. Local
differences in cultural patterns are neglected, although some of them are conspicuous, For example, the Aymaras of the
Chilean altiplano do not depend on fish as
one of their protein resources because of
their geographic location far away from the
coast and from the Lake Titicaca Basin
which is the habitation of their Bolivian
counterparts. Similar changes in fishing
habits also occurred in the Atacamefios
after they moved inland from coastal areas
in the recent past.

Linguistic variability: The linguistic
classification of South American Indians as
given by Greenberg (1960) consists of a
nested hierarchy of family, subfamily, and
group. Although this classification does not
take into account all the dissimilarities between these seven tribal languages, alternatives are not always acceptable. In other
classifications, a given language may be
classed in four or five different families by

Social Biology

as many authorities, resulting in rather
serious implications for cultural-historical
reconstructions (Steward and Faron, 1959,
pp. 25-26). In our analysis, linguistic distance is taken as zero if the languages beJong to the same group; the unit distance
is ascribed to languages belonging to two
different groups of the same subfamily;
and a distance of three is assigned between
languages belonging to two different families. In principle, a distance of two units
would correspond to languages belonging to
two different subfamilies of the same family. However, such a situation does not
arise in these seven languages according
to Greenberg’s classification (see Llop and
Rothhammer, 1974, for a similar analysis
of linguistic diversity).

Geographic distance and variations in
degree of miscegenation: As mentioned
previously, the geographic locations of the
seven populations are represented by the
latitudes and longitudes of the places from
which the samples are drawn. The transformation used to convert these coordinates
to a distance matrix in kilometers is somewhat different from Morton’s (1969). In
our computation, the distance between two
locations is represented by

Di —— 2R Sin~1[4 {1
— Cos x; Cos x; Cos (41 — 4;)
— Sin x; Sin x;}]12

where FR is earth’s radius at the equator,
(xi, ¥;) and (x;, yj) are latitude-longitude
of the locations transformed in radians.
The variation in the degree of Caucasoid
admixture is determined only from the
ABO blood group. The Caucasoid admixture rates for the seven populations are 4,
5, 17,5, 7, 6, and 13 per cent, respectively,
in the order mentioned earlier (Rothhammer and Llop, 1974). Assuming that these
figures are representative of the entire
genome, the probability that two genes

of Indian origin is (1 — 0,04)(1 — 0.17)
= 0.797. The variation in the degree of
admixture is thus studied in terms of these
probabilities which vary between 0.722 and
0.912.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To determine the nature of interrelationships among all the aforementioned measures of variability, we first computed the
correlation coefficients between them using
all the 21 population comparisons (Table
3). Note that cultura] and geographic dis

of such a regression analysis is shown in
Table 4. This analysis also indicates that
of all the variables, only geographic distance seems to be the important factor,
explaining the trend in genetic variabilities
in these seven Andean populations.

This result is in accordance with the
theoretical study of Maruyama (1973).
The relationship of genetic distance with
the geographic distance is studied further
by relating the probability of allelism between two homologous genes with the geographic distance by which two groups are

although a few large deviations from expectations exist toward the tail of the

point that an earlier study (Blanco and
Chakraborty, 1975) with a similar set of
populations also revealed similar results.
As mentioned in our earlier study, such a
relationship may not hold for populations
known to be unstable insofar as their habitats are concerned.

It may be noted that there is also a high
association between cultural and genetic
variabilities (Table 3) in these seven
tribal populations. However, this association may be an artifact of the other two
Significant values in the same table. Such
an association is also exhibited through
the regression analysis (Table 4), in the
sense that in addition to geographic dis
 

tance, cultural differences do not contribute significantly in explaining the variability in genetic distances. The high correlation between culture and geography
may also be interpreted from historical
evidence since within these populations
geographic proximity was the only way of
establishing cultural contact in the past.
Furthermore, the material culture as described here is not independent of ecological niche, especially because cultural distances are computed from information
which includes subsistence.
