ABSTRACT: During the last two decades some industrialized nations witnessed varying degrees of
constriction in their sex gaps in overall life expectancy. We investigate this development by paying particular attention to the contributions of major causes of death to the change in the difference between 1970 and 1990. The analysis is based on the experiences of seven nations: Australia, United States, Sweden, England and Wales, Portugal, Hungary, and Japan. In the first
four countries the gap has been narrowing during the last twenty years; in Hungary and Japan,
the difference remains substantial and continues to expand; in Portugal the situation is characterized by a slowdown in the amount by which the sex gap is expanding over time. We apply decomposition analysis to answer the following questions: (1) What is the relative contribution of
major causes of death to sex differences in average length of life within broad age categories? (2)
How do the contributions of age and cause of death vary across time to either widen or narrow

the sex gap in survival? (3) How do the patterns of cause contribution vary across societies?

During this century industrialized
countries have followed a pattern of
widening sex differences in life expectancy at birth. This difference has favored females over males by anywhere
from two to seven years, depending on the
time period and the country.’ Notwithstanding a continuation of life expectancy
gains by both sexes, some societies have
witnessed during the last two decades
varying degrees of constriction in the sex
difference in overall survival. Though not
yet widespread to all industrialized nations, this trend may represent an emerging feature of the most advanced stages of
epidemiologic transition (Omran, 1971;

‘Before the advent of modern medicine in the Western world, females had higher death rates than males in
the ages between 15 and 49 (i.e., the childbearing
years).

 

Olshansky and Ault, 1986; Rogers and
Hackenberg, 1991; Trovato and Lalu,
1996). Should this phenomenon sustain,
it will represent a break from the historical pattern of change in one of the most
entrenched differences in human populations (Ascadi and Nemeskeri, 1970;
Lopez, 1983; Vallin, 1983, 1993; Preston,
1976; Stolnitz, 1956; Waldron, 1993).
Our statistical analysis of the change
in this differential involves an examination of cause-of-death contributions to the
sex gap within broad categories of age
between 1970 and 1980, and then between 1980 and 1990. We have selected
seven nations which represent varying
patterns of development in the difference
in survival between men and women:
Australia, the United States, Sweden,
England/Wales, Portugal, Hungary, and

Japan. The first four societies are highly
advanced Western nations where the sex
gap has been narrowing. Portugal is a
country where the gap has continued to
widen, but the magnitude of change in
this measure over time (i.e., the rate of
change of sex gap with respect to time) 1s
getting smaller. Hungary and Japan reflect two diverse societies where the difference in survival has been expanding by
a relatively large amount over the last two
decades. We investigate the varied experiences of these seven nations from the
point of view of three questions: (1) What
is the relative contribution of causes of
death categories to sex differences in average length of life within broad age
groups? (2) How do the contributions of
age and cause of death vary across time
periods to either widen or narrow the sex
gap in survival? (3) What is the pattern of
cause contribution to the sex gap within
each of the seven nations?

CHANGE IN THE SEX
DIFFERENTIAL IN LIFE
EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH: 1940-1990

Figure 1 shows country-specific trends
in the differential (i.e., the female expectancy minus the male expectancy) from
1940 to 1990 in ten-year intervals.’? In
1940 the gaps in overall survival ranged
from a low of 2.8 in Japan, to a high of 6.2
in Portugal. The peak value of this difference in Australia, the United States and
Sweden, occurred in 1980. In England and
Wales (hereafter England/Wales) the apex
took place a decade earlier.

The life expectancy figures are actually for the following periods: 1939-41, 1949-51, 1959-61, 1970,
1980, and 1990. Data sources are given in the footnote
in Figure 1.

 

Social Biology

Since 1980, the gender-based difference in Hungary has been expanding by a
relatively large amount; and by 1990 this
country showed the most pronounced disparity of all seven nations in this analysis.
Earlier this century (i.e., in 1940) Hungarian women lived on average 4.2 more
years than their male counterparts. By the
early 1970’s this gap had risen to 5.9,
widening to 9.0 years in 1990. The divergence in the sex gap in this society can be
attributed to the large mortality gains females have enjoyed over the past four or
five decades on the one hand, and to
some erosion in male expectancy, most
noticeable since the early 1970's.

Currently, the life expectancies of
Japanese men and women exceed those
of other persons in all other nations
(Yanagishita and Guralnik, 1988). However, the sex differential in overall survival in this country has been expanding.
The change in the sex gap peaked during
the decade of the 1960’s, when the female advantage over males had increased
from that which prevailed in the preceding decade by 1.50 years of life expectancy. Between 1960 and 1970 there
occurred a decline of half a year in this
measure; and even though there was no
perceptible change between 1970 and
1980, over the ensuing decade the disparity had expanded by almost a whole year
of life expectation (i.e., 0.90), representing one of the largest expansions in the
sex gap across all industrialized nations.

Fic. 1.—Change of female-male gap in life expectancy at age zero, 1940-1990. (Data are from World
Health Organization Statistics Annual for periods before 1970. For 1970, 1980, and 1990, data are from
World Health Organization computerized tapes. Data for Portugal, 1940, are from Preston et al., 1972. Data

for Hungary, 1940, are not available.)

have documented that narrowing of sex
differences in overall life expectancy in
industrialized nations is the result of a
more rapid acceleration of male expectancy over the last two decades, coupled
with a concomitant slowdown in the pace
of female gains in this measure. We have
observed a similar situation among the
four countries in this analysis that have
experienced some degree of narrowing in

the sex gap—that is, in the United States, 
Australia, England and Wales, and Sweden. In nations where the sex gap continues to expand, as in Portugal, Japan, and
Hungary, the female expectancy has risen

faster than that of males (equations available on request).

In the first four countries, the underlying dynamics for narrowing sex differences in survival are likely to be found
in relatively recent changes in mortality
among the older age segments of the population. In fact, Olshansky and Ault
(1986) have shown that since the early
1970’s mortality declines in the United
States (and presumably also in other
highly advanced nations) are concentrated
mostly at advanced ages; and the distribution of deaths for degenerative conditions
is being shifted progressively toward the

4 Trovato and Lalu

older ages. However, mortality changes in
youth and the working ages may also play
an important part in either widening or
narrowing sex differences in life expectation over time. Rogers and Hackenberg
(1991) have argued that the contemporary
epidemiological scene in advanced nations is increasingly being conditioned by
life styles and personal behaviors, as reflected in the use of harmful and illegal
substances, alcohol, and tobacco. The rising incidence of social pathologies among
the relatively young, and increased risks
of motor vehicle fatalities, suicide, homicide, and other forms of violence, account
for an alarming number of deaths on a
yearly basis (Singh and Yu, 1996). The
rise of HIV/AIDS and the reemergence of
resistant strains of tuberculosis, also have
strong links to profligate practices.
Concerning smoking, until relatively
recently in history, lung cancer death
rates have been rising more rapidly for
males than for females. It now appears
that this cause of premature mortality is
increasing faster among females. According to Lopez et al. (1995), between 1950
and 1980 in the industrialized world the
female age-adjusted death rate of lung
cancer increased by 330 per cent, while
that of males rose by 270 per cent. “What
has happened,” they say “. . . is that social
and economic emancipation of women
has removed societal taboos against practices such as cigarette smoking” (p. 12).
Other researchers have estimated that the
future is bound to witness further increases in female lung cancer mortality,
and that over the next thirty years tobacco-related deaths among women will
more than double (Bartecchi et al., 1994;
Chollat-Traquet, 1992; Lopez, 1995).
Given the significance of lung cancer as a
determinant of overall mortality in con
 

Social Biology

temporary society, the rise in the death
rate among women may differentiate those
nations that have experienced a reduction
in the magnitude of the sex gap in life expectancy from those that continue to follow a widening trend in this measure.

Nathanson (1995) has proposed that female life expectancy has been rising more
rapidly in societies where the female
emancipation movement has not yet attained 4 “mature” stage. In such countries
female smoking is not widely accepted,
and the rise in lung cancer mortality has
not been as steep as in those nations where
women have been “liberated” from conventions governing this type of behavior.
Consequently, women’s life expectancy in
the “less liberated” societies has been rising faster over time (and presumably this
rise has contributed to a continuation of
widening sex gaps in survival) than in nations where the female emancipation movement is well-established, as in the cases of
the United States, Sweden, Netherlands,
Australia, and the United Kingdom. Of
course, the amount of contraction or expansion in the gender-based difference in
life expectancy in a given society will also
depend on the male mortality trends from
lung cancer, and the extent to which males
have been abandoning smoking or foregoing this habit altogether.

The female emancipation thesis may.
also be of relevance to explaining changing sex differences in suicide. This cause
of death is directly linked to problems in
living. If the changing role of women in
society entails negative consequences, female suicide rates in the most advanced
nations should be on the increase. In fact,
according to the observations of Ruzicka
(1995), between the mid-1950’s and mid1980’s, marked increases in suicide in the
industrialized world have tended to occur

Vol. 45, No. 1-2

more often in females than in males. It remains to be seen whether in fact changes
in male and female suicide over the last
two decades have contributed to either
widening or narrowing sex gaps in life expectancy, and whether the effect of such
changes has been uniform across societies.

In addition to suicide and lung cancer,
we will pay specific attention to other
causes of death that are known to be
strongly associated with life style and behavioral practices. We examine change in
sex differences in mortality from accidents
and violence, cirrhosis of the liver and
heart disease. If over recent history women
have increasingly been adopting “masculine” modes of behavior, they should exhibit some of the negative health effects
associated with these types of diseases,
and the effects of changing sex differences
in mortality from these causes should all
contribute to narrowing of the sex gap in
life expectancy. However, this explanation
may apply more in some societies than
in others. For example, these types of
changes in mortality may explain in part
the narrowing of gender differences in
overall survival in Australia, United States,
Sweden, and England/Wales, whereas in
Portugal, Hungary, and Japan, the contributions of these same components may
serve to widen the sex difference because
the female emancipation movement may
not be as fully developed as in the preceding nations (Nathanson, 1995).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS

Temporal changes (decreases or increases) in life expectancy in infancy are
typically not equally attributable to all

Life Expectancy 5

age categories in the life table (Arriaga,
1984). For example, in highly advanced
nations, where spectacular mortality improvements in infancy and childhood
have already been actualized, further survival gains in these age segments will not
produce very large increases in life expectancy at age zero. In developing countries, however, where the fight against
death has not reached such a high level of
success, improvements in early age mortality would raise life expectancy in infancy by a significant amount. It is also
true that age groups experience different
rank order of primacy in the causes responsible for death, as in the case of accidents and violence in youth and young
adulthood, and chronic/degenerative conditions prevailing in the older ages.

In order to take these important points
into account our decomposition analysis
is executed separately by age. We analyze
partial expectation of life (PEL) differences between the sexes within the following age groups: 0-15, 15-35, 35-55,
55-75, and 75M. PEL at age x for the age
interval x to x Mn is defined as the average number of years lived in the interval
x to xMn by those who reach age x, and
is expressed as "e, © (TN T,y,,)/1, (Arriaga, 1984). Using life table notation, 7,
is the total number of person-years lived
by those who reach age x (© 1,) between
age x and the end of the life span. We
constructed separate abridged multiple
decrement life tables for the sexes (using
standard life groupings for age: 0—1, 1-5,
5-10, ..., 85M); and from these tables
we derived PEL within the broad age intervals indicated above over three separate time periods, 1970, 1980, and 1990.

- Note that PEL for a given age class is
not affected by mortality changes in other
age groups and thus may be thought of
 

 

as a measure derived from a life table
summarizing the death rates in a selected
age range alone. It should be noted that
"e, has an upper limit of n which can be
attained only when the death rate for all
ages in the interval x to x+n are zero. For
example, PEL for age interval 15 to 34
(i.e., e,.) is the average number of years
lived in the age interval 15 to 34 by those
_, Who survive to age 15. It is clear that the
= maximum value of the expected number
‘of years lived in this interval is 20 years.
_ 8Moreover, from the definition of Te, it can
® be easily seen that ey = X[1,/ly . "e,].
A Sex differences in PEL within an age
% group are decomposed into components
ct that can be attributed to various causes of
codeath. To illustrate, consider a hypothetical case where mortality is a function of
‘gonly two causes of death. In the context
oof multiple decrement life tables, the PEL
S for n years at age x in this case will be a
= function of the cause-specific probabiliCties of death for the two diseases in the
“sage interval x to xn. That is,

sity of

"e (males) = F(A, B) (1)
"e, (females) = F(a, b) (2)

y [Univer

where A and B are the vectors of agespecific probabilities of death from the two
causes in the age interval x to x+n for
A males; and a and b are the corresponding
vectors for females. Thus, the sex difference in PEL can be decomposed into the
two cause components (Das Gupta, 1993):

wnloaded b

Difference in "e,=F(a,b)— F(A, B)
= [F(a,b) —F(A,b)+ F(a,B)— F(A, B)V/2
+[F(a,b)—F(a,B)+ F(A,b)—F(A,B)\V/2. (3)

The first and second components are attributable to the first and second causes of
death respectively; and the sum of the two

components will therefore add up to the
total gender difference in PEL. In substantive terms each component represents its
net contribution to the sex difference in
PEL as a function of sex difference in that
cause of death if all other causes were held
constant in this particular age interval.
Components with positive values would
indicate that the sex mortality differential
for that cause of death serves to increase
the female advantage in PEL over males,
whereas a negative value would reflect the
opposite effect. The magnitude of component contributions can be expressed either
in relative terms (1.e., as percentage) or in
absolute terms (i.e., in actual years of life
expectancy). Since the decomposition analysis is based on multiple decrement life tables, our statistical results are net of age
compositional differences.

The data analyzed in this study were
provided by the World Health Organization (1995) as a multidimensional tabulation including deaths by age, sex, country, year, cause of death, and population
counts. The ten cause-of-death components chosen for this analysis represent
causes of wide significance in the context
of advanced societies due to their strong
association with life style and behavior:
Cl=heart disease; C2 = other circulatory —
diseases; C3=lung cancer; C4=breast
cancer; C5=prostate cancer; C6= other
cancers; C7=cirrhosis of the liver; C8 =
other accidents and violence excluding
suicide; C9 = suicide; and C10 =all other
cause of death (residual).

In our decomposition analysis, each
cause component is expressed as having
an independent effect on the PEL difference within a given age range while holding constant the effects of other causes.
We pay attention to both period-specific
contributions as well as to change in con

Vol. 45, No. 1-2

tribution of cause components. The former
type of observation provides indication of
how much a given cause accounts for the
difference in survival in a given time point,
while the latter affords an assessment of
whether a given cause of death acts either
to widen or narrow the sex gap in PEL.
For example, if the trend in contribution of
lung cancer to the sex difference in PEL in
a given age range declines between two
time periods, this decline would signify
that changes in sex differences in lung
cancer mortality over time served to narrow the sex difference in PEL (i.e., the female advantage in partial expectation of
life over males). An increasing time trend
would denote the opposite effect.

These interpretations are premised on
the fact that in the majority of cases
sex differences in mortality from major
causes of death are characterized by men
having the higher death rates, and therefore time-wise reduction in contribution
to PEL differences by a given cause
would most certainly arise as a result of
larger male than female gains in survival
over time. Of course, the possible mechanisms which would result in a narrowing
of PEL differences may involve a variety
of combinations in sex-specific changes
in cause-specific mortality, such as when
between periods the male death rate declines while that of females increases, or
when both rates decline but that of men
declines more, or when female rates remain constant and those of men decline.

RESULTS

AGE PATTERN OF SEX DIFFERENCES
IN PEL

Our analysis (detailed decomposition
calculations available on request) of com
Life Expectancy 7

puted age-cause-specific sex differences
in PEL (measured as the female minus
male PEL) for each country during three
points in time suggested the following
summary (refer to Table 1 and Figure 2):

(a) The age pattern of sex differences in
PEL is fairly constant across societies.
The gaps are small in the youngest age
classes and peak in the oldest age category (in Hungary, they peak at age
55-75).

(b) Below age 15, PEL differences between the sexes are very small, but all
seven nations show temporal declines
in their gaps.

(c) Among 15-35 year olds, Portugal and
Hungary show rising time trends in
their PEL gaps ({i.e., increasing female
gains over males) while the other five
countries follow the opposite pattern.
In 1990, Portugal, Hungary, and USA
had the largest sex gaps in this age category, while the smallest gaps occurred in Japan and Sweden.

(d) For the age group 35-55, Hungary is
the only nation with rising PEL differentials over time. The other societies
in this analysis experienced either declining or stable sex gaps in this age
category.

(e) In general, the largest age-specific declines in sex differences in PEL between
1970 and 1990 are evidenced among
55-75 year olds. Hungary deviates from
this pattern, as it shows a widening of
the PEL gap in this age group.

(f) The PEL differential among persons 75
and older has been expanding in favor
of females, except for Australia and
USA, where the gap has been constricting, at least since 1980.

© Heart Disease.—Period-specific con‘tributions of heart disease to sex differences in PEL tend to be largest in the age
5 groups of 55-75 and 75 and older. How3
gover, the pattern of contribution of this
S disease to the gender-based difference in
E survival is different in the nations of AusA tralia, USA, England/Wales, and Sweden
from those of Portugal, Hungary, and
Japan. Figure 3 indicates clearly that in
the former set of nations there is a general pattern of declining contribution over
time among not only 55-75 year olds, but
also among those aged 35-55. In Hungary and Japan the corresponding pat_ terns for these same age groups tend to
be in the opposite direction. This tendency is also seen in connection with the
oldest age group in these societies, partic

ularly in Japan, where this category displays large contributions of heart disease
to expand the sex gap in PEL. The situation concerning heart disease in Portugal
is reflective of a society that is somewhat
in-between the experiences of the two
sets of nations above. Although among
35-55 year olds since 1980 the contribution of heart disease to the sex difference
in survival has been larger, in the subsequent age classes its contribution has
served to reduce the sex gap in survival.

As shown in Figure 3, in Australia,
USA, Sweden, and England/Wales, the
decline in the amount of contribution of
this disease to the sex gap has been largest
among 55-75 year olds. The contribution
of this cause among those aged 75 and
above between 1980 and 1990 are not as
spectacular.

Accidents and Violence (Excluding Suicide).—Along with “residual” cause component, accidents and violence (excluding
suicide) is responsible for a large portion
of the sex gap in PEL in the ages below 35,
reflecting to some extent problems with
safety for young boys and girls on the one
hand, and difficulties in living on the other,
particularly for those aged 15-35, where
accidents and violence figure prominently
as risk factors of premature mortality. As
demonstrated in Table 2 and Figure 4, for
the under-15 age category, changes in sex
differences in this component over time
have tended to reduce the sex gap in PEL
in all seven nations. This finding implies
that in a comparative sense, over time
boys in this age class have been making
larger improvements in risk than girls.

What is striking about the time trend
of this cause of death in 15-35 year olds,
is its uniformity across nations in showing
overall declines in contribution at least
since 1980. Hungary presents the only ex

ponent has served to have a narrowing
effect on the PEL gap (change in agespecific death rates available on request).

Concerning 35-55 year olds, the situation regarding contribution of this cause is
mixed: In England/Wales it is curvilinear,
with a decline between 1970 and 1980,
followed by a rise thereafter to more-orJess the same level as in 1970. Hungary
shows a striking upward trend, while all
other five countries have followed a declining pattern over the three time points.
These trends indicate that social and economic conditions in Hungary must not
have been very favorable to males in this
age range over the last two decades
(Eberstadt, 1995). In fact, judging from
the patterns in Figure 4, this same conclusion would apply to men in the older age
categories as well.

With the exception of Hungary, all other
countries show a declining time effect on
the sex gap in PEL among 55~75 year olds.
However, among those aged 75+ the effect
of change in this component has contributed to a widening of the survival differential except for the United States. Interestingly, Japan and Sweden demonstrate
the largest positive contribution to the sex
gap in PEL in the 75+ category

Lung Cancer—lIn Figure 5 there are
striking differences in the pattern of
period-specific contributions to sex differences in PEL between the four countries
where narrowing has occurred and the
three nations where divergence is continuing. In the former case the temporal trend
in contribution for ages beginning with
35-55 is clearly downward—at least since
1980— indicating that over the period sex
differences in lung cancer mortality have
changed in such a manner as to narrow
the PEL differences. The situations of
Portugal, Hungary, and Japan reflect the

Life Expectancy 13

opposite pattern of effect on PEL. In these
societies there have been rising contributions of lung cancer mortality differences
between the sexes on the PEL gaps in the
corresponding age classes.

The varied trends in lung cancer contribution between these two sets of nations are generally consistent with the
Nathanson (1995) thesis, that in societies
where female emancipation is at a “mature” stage (i.e., Australia, USA, Sweden,
England/Wales) prolonged smoking among
women has been responsible for some
erosion in the degree of life expectancy
gains as compared to men, partly as a
function of more rapid rise in lung cancer
death rates in women.

Cancer of the Breast and _ of
Prostate.—Mortality rates for these two
gender-specific ailments have been rising
in the industrialized world. The former
disease tends to kil] women in their late
reproductive ages, while the latter claims
mostly older men. The contribution of
breast cancer to the sex gap in life expectancy will always be to narrow the difference, while that of prostate cancer will
always widen it. Judging from the magnitude of temporal effects of these two
cause components, in the age range of
35-55 breast cancer has had a larger impact in explaining temporal changes in
life expectancy differences than has
prostate cancer; but in the older age
groups the effects of prostate cancer are
greater. In Portugal, Hungary, and Japan
the impact of breast cancer tends to be
larger than that of prostate cancer.

Other Cancers.—This component contains many cancers besides those already
mentioned. Its contribution to PEL differentials appears to be of significance
mainly in the two older age groups. In
Japan it has considerable impact on the

Fic. 5.—Contribution of lung cancer to sex gap in PEL (female-male) by country and year.

Suicide.—Suicide differences between sex differences in coping with problems
men and women are partly a reflection of in living. Our calculations (available on

 

 
 

16 Trovato and Lalu

request) indicate that in 1990 this cause
of death explained between 6 and 7 per
cent of the sex gap in life expectancy at
age zero. In Hungary, where the suicide
rate is one of the highest in the world, the
contribution is in the order of 10 per cent.
Period-specific effects of sex differences in suicide on the gender-based difference in PEL tend to be most pronounced in the ages of 15-35 and 35-55.
— As shown in Figure 6, in Australia, USA,
Si and England/Wales, the time trend in
6 contribution is generally upward across
E all age classes (but in the USA among
® 55-75 year olds the trend was down beoo tween 1970 and 1980, but went up in the
< subsequent period). This general pattern
= of contribution indicates that in compari= son to females, the suicide rates of men
—have increased more over time, or possiS& bly declined less, thus serving to widen
the age-specific sex gaps in PEL. The
S temporal pattern of change in contribu‘6 tion in Sweden is generally downward,
indicating the opposite situation has pre5 vailed, with the exception that in the oldE est age group male suicide has increased
~ more than that of females.
= In Portugal, Hungary, and Japan, the
DB age-specific contributions of suicide to
3 PEL differences is less regular. In Portu"s gal, between 1970 and 1980 there oc© curred substantial reductions in contribution among 35-55 and 55~75 year olds,
with no perceptible change thereafter.
However, in the 15-34 age class there
was a noticeable rise in contribution to
PEL gap between 1980 and 1990, a situation that describes the experience among
those aged 75 and above. Thus, in this
country, there appears to have been some
significant improvements among men in
suicide risk between 1970 and 1980, but
this trend seems to have stalled thereafter.

 

Social Biology

In Hungary the peak of contribution to
the sex gap in survival is noticeable among
35-55 year olds, where there is a clear upper temporal pattern of influence on PEL
difference, which means that women have
continued to gain more than men in terms of
survival, It is also clear in Figure 6 that
among 15-35 year olds, males have enjoyed
some degree of improvement over females
between 1980 and 1990, a situation which
repeats itself in the oldest age category.

In Japan since 1980 there have been
larger male improvements in risk reduction as compared to females in the ages of
15-35 and 35-55, but not in the subsequent two age categories, where the opposite conclusion applies. It would seem that
these two age-specific trends have canceled each other out in terms of net impact
on overall sex difference in life expectancy
in infancy, as the amount of widening or
narrowing in these ages is about equal.

Residual Causes.—This component
consists of many heterogeneous causes of
death, including infectious diseases and
conditions associated with infancy and
childhood. From the data contained in
Table 2, we find that this component is
responsible for a large part of the sex gap
in PEL in the age group below 15 and
generally ranks either first or second
among 55-75 and 75+ age groups. Its
time trend of contribution to PEL differences is generally downward, reflecting
larger male improvements from this condition over time. Therefore, in grosso
modo, temporal changes in sex differences in residual causes have tended to
contribute to a narrowing of PEL gap.

18 Trovato and Lalu

decomposition analysis has helped in
providing a better understanding of the
cause-of-death components that have
been responsible for these societies’ different trajectories of change in this measure over the last two decades. Varying
levels of improvement in mortality across
countries for males as compared to females explain why the gender-based gap
in survival has been narrowing in some
countries and widening in others. In Australia, the United States, Sweden, and
England/Wales, constrictions in the survival gap can be attributed to larger improvements in cause-specific mortality
among men as compared to women, particularly in the 55~75 age category. The
leading cause components for this development are heart disease, accidents and
violence (excluding suicide), and lung
cancer. Rising rates of breast cancer mortality in women have also added to this
trend by reducing their pace of life expectancy gains over time. In other words,
female expectancy would be noticeably
higher were it not for the counteracting
effects of rising breast cancer mortality.
~ In Portugal, Hungary, and Japan, the ex= pansion of the sex differential can be at'S tributed to these same cause components,
<S except that in these countries men have
not enjoyed a commensurate level of
mortality improvement as in the other
four nations.

In these three societies, males would
close some of the female advantage in
survival if middle-aged men were to experience larger improvements over time
with respect to causes such as heart disease in particular, accidents and violence,
and lung cancer. Portugal seems to be
closer to actualizing this condition than
either Hungary or Japan. In Japan, the
survival gap would eventually narrow if

adult men were to experience larger mortality improvements with respect to “other
cancers,” “other circulatory diseases,” and
“accidents/violence,’ since these causes
account for a large portion of the genderbased discrepancy in survival.

We have found that much of the differential in life expectancy between the sexes
is attributable to sex differences in mortality in late adulthood and old age. This is
particularly true in Australia, the United
States, Sweden, and England/Wales, where
constrictions in the sex gap are mainly the
result of changing mortality dynamics in
the 55-75 and 75+ age classes, and to a
lesser extent among the 35-55 year olds.
This finding is consistent with the proposition of Olshansky and Ault (1986) concerning the rising importance of old age
mortality in the fourth stage of epidemiological transition.

At the same time, one should not overlook the contribution of the younger age
segments to either narrowing or widening
sex gaps in survival. Our analysis indicated that men in the age ranges of 15-35
and 35-55 have experienced notable mortality improvements over time with respect to some of the most lethal conditions, including accidents and violence
(but not suicide), heart disease, and lung
cancer. This situation was shown to be
most prevalent in those countries where
the gender gap in life expectancy at age
zero has been narrowing (i.e., Australia,
United States, Sweden and England/
Wales). This aspect of our analysis lends
some support to the views of Rogers and
Hackenberg (1991) concerning the growing importance of epidemiological shifts
among youth and young adults in explaining convergent trends in survival between the sexes across advanced societies.

Concerning the possible link between
female emancipation and the changing
sex gap in life expectancy, our findings
provide some support for the proposition
that in some societies the sex differential
in overall survival has been constricting
partly as a result of either more rapidly
rising female death rates from lung cancer and/or a slowdown in the pace of increase in the male death rate from this
disease. In Australia, the United States,
England/Wales, and Sweden, where the
female emancipation movement has attained a “mature” stage, a large part of
the narrowing trend in the sex differential can also be attributed to females not
having made as large an improvement in
risk reduction as men with respect to
accidents and violence (excluding suicide). These trends suggest that perhaps
changes in the role and status of women
in society may be associated with these
tendencies in the pattern and pace of
change in survival over time. However, it
is clear that the emancipation hypothesis

Life Expectancy 19

is an incomplete explanation for the phenomenon of narrowing sex differences in
life expectancy observed in this research.
A more comprehensive explanation of
changing gender roles and mortality convergence is needed to take into account
changes in the behaviors of men and
women simultaneously, and how such
changes affect their survival probabilities.
More attention should be directed to how
the male role is changing and how this
change relates to reductions in death rates
from leading causes, including heart disease, lung cancer, accidents, violence,
and suicide.
