ABSTRACT: Comparison of birthplaces of parents and offspring in Longford, Ireland, shows a
high proportion of offspring with birthplaces outside of Ireland. Upon closer examination it was
found that the majority of these children had parents who themselves were born in Ireland.
These findings indicate a high rate of return migration, whereby an emigrant returns to his/her
place of origin. These findings have three genetic implications: (1) Return migration may act to
lower the total rate of long-range gene flow into a population. (2) Comparison of parent and
offspring migration data without taking return migration into account may lead to incorrect
inferences of demographic change. (3) Failure to account for return migration may produce
inaccurate estimates of genetic variation based on migration parameters.

A major interest in anthropological
genetics has been the investigation of
differing patterns of human migration
and their subsequent effects on mate
choice and gene frequency variation.
While a variety of genetic and demographic models dealing with migration
have been developed, a number of
studies have shown human migration to
be more complex than shown by simple
models of gene flow. Such studies have
revealed a number of interesting effects,
such as non-Markovian migration (Kramer, 1981), effects of population size on
rates of population interaction (Lalouel
and Langaney, 1976; Relethford et al.,
1981), differential migration to specific
populations (Devor, 1980; Brennan and
Relethford, 1983), and kin-structured
migration (Fix, 1978). The last is particularly interesting, since it illustrates a
means by which migration might act to
increase, rather than decrease, interpopulational variaility.

One aspect of human migration
which has not yet been looked at from a
population genetic perspective is return

migration, which refers to movement of
an individual back to his/her birthplace
to resettle (Gmelch, 1980). Return migration has become more frequent during the last century, particularly in Europe. The reasons for return migration
are varied, but most often are psychological in nature, such as family ties or
strong feelings toward one’s homeland.
A detailed review of return migration
may be found in Gmelch (1980).

The purpose of this paper is to provide an example of return migration using data collected in Ireland and to interpret potential genetic consequences.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data reported here were collected during the summer of 1977 in the
city of Longford, County Longford, the
Republic of Ireland as part of a growth
study of Irish schoolchildren. Anthropometric and skin reflectance measures
were collected for boys from St. Michael’s School and boys and girls from
the Melview School. Portions of these

data have been reported elsewhere
(Relethford et al., 1978; Lees et al.,
1979). A total of 361 children, ranging in
age from four to 14 years, were measured.

As part of our study we collected information on the county of birth for all
children and their mothers and fathers.
Complete birthplace data were available for 321 children (and 642 parents).

i, We combined all birthplaces into three
S categories for analysis: (1) those born in
3 County Longford, (2) those born else2 where in Ireland (and Northern Ire3 land), and (3) those born outside of IreA land.

RESULTS

The number of mothers, fathers, and
offspring are reported in Table 1 by
2 birthplace. For both parents and offthe greatest proportion of indi= viduals were born in County Longford,
> followed by the rest of Ireland, and then
‘z followed by those born outside of Ire© Jand. Birthplace distributions of moth2 ers and fathers are not significantly dif= ferent (x*=4.62, df=2, P > 0.05).
s Birthplace distributions for the com2 bined parent and offspring samples are
5 significantly different (y? = 38.36,
= df=2, P < 0.001). The sources of this
4 difference were assessed using the ¢-test
for equality of percentages (Sokal and

nee at 13:39 08

Rohlf, 1969) for each birthplace category. The proportions of parents and
offspring born in County Longford are
not significantly different (t= —1.41,
df=, P>0.05). A significantly greater
proportion of parents were born in the
rest of Ireland compared to offspring
(t=4,.36, df=“, P< 0.001), and a
significantly greater proportion of offspring were born outside of Ireland
compared to parents (t = 5.06, df=~,
P < 0.001).

At first glance, these findings might
suggest several demographic interpretations. For example, the greater proportion of long-range migrants among offspring could reflect an increase in such
migration into Longford over time. Another interpretation is return migration,
where a large proportion of offspring
born outside of Ireland have parents
who were born in Ireland. This interpretation is supported by an investigation of
the birthplaces of parents of the 44 children who were born outside of Ireland,
reported in Table 2. Here, a high percentage of these children have one or
both parents who were born in Ireland
(93.8 per cent). Also, a high percentage
of these children have one or both parents born in County Longford (70.5 per
cent). Thus, the majority of the longrange migration of offspring reported in
Table 1 is due to return migration on the
part of the parents.

DISCUSSION

There are several genetic implications of return migration in human populations. The net effort of return migration would be to lower the overall rate of
long-range migration. Given the fact
that return migration tends to be a relatively recent occurrence (Gmelch,
1980), a decrease in total gene flow
might be expected in certain populations during recent times. In genetic
terms, this would mean a decrease in the
rate at which local gene frequencies become closer to regional values, an increase in the potential effects of genetic
drift, and an increase in the degree of
random inbreeding. Obviously, the extent of such changes would depend on
the rate of return migration relative to
other immigration. Based on our findings here, rates of return migration
might be expected to be rather high in
some populations. More research is
needed to ascertain the genetic effects of
return migration under varying population structures.

Return migration also has an important implication when migration data
are used to assess demographic change
over time. As noted above, the high percentage of offspring born outside of Ireland (13.7 per cent) relative to the percentage of parents born outside of

Ireland (4.2 per cent) might suggest an
increase in long-range migration from
one generation to the next. Once return
migration is accounted for, the actual
percentage of long-range migrants
among the children is considerably
lower (2.2 per cent), suggesting a decrease in long-range migration over
time. Of course, more data are needed
to evaluate this hypothesis. The main
point is that return migration can act to
inflate migration estimates.

Another aspect of return migration
relates to the use of estimates of longrange migration in measures of genetic
drift and consanguinity (see CavalliSforza and Bodmer, 1971). The use of a
migration estimate which includes return migration will clearly be an overestimate, resulting in lower estimates of
random inbreeding and potential genetic drift. In situations such as the
present study, where the long-range migration estimate of offspring is 3.3 times
that of the parents, widely different genetic parameters could be estimated depending on which generation is sampled.

In sum, we note that there are a number of ways in which return migration
could affect the genetic structure of a
population. We hope future research
will be geared toward a more complete
understanding of this phenomenon.
