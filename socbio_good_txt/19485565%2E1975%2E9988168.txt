The relative frequency of congenital malformations in various population groups has
received considerable attention in recent
years, The problems associated with comparing malformation rates in various groups
are well recognized and have been discussed
in depth by many authors (Neel, 1958;
Stevenson et al., 1966; Morton et al., 1967;
Kennedy, 1967; Lilienfeld, 1970). Despite
the problems of comparability, a variety of
hypotheses and models have been set forth
which relate to the etiology of such malformations.

Comparison of malformation rates among
races and of the effects of interracial crosses
has been of particular interest in understanding the genetic basis of birth defects.
Thus, in studies of Japanese infants, Neel
(1958) observed that the total malformation rate was similar to those reported in
other diverse populations, even though rates
for specific malformations varied considerably. Subsequently, he proposed that a significant fraction of human congenital defects might be segregants from multilocal
homeostatic systems. Morton et al. (1967)
in a study of racial crosses in Hawaii obtained similar results in regard to total rate

of malformation among different races.
However, their data showed no effect of
outcrossing and “therefore no evidence that
multiple homozygous ‘phenodeviants’ are
of importance in the etiology of congenital
defects” (p. 112). More recently, Carter
(1970) suggested that the proposition that
the total malformation rate is constant
among racial groups may not be true.

The purpose of the present report is to
document the overall malformation rate as
well as frequencies of certain specific malformations in the American Indian. Since
the American Indian is considered a migrant population long separated from its
parental stock, comparison of these results
with those available for other Mongoloid
groups is of interest. A further objective
of this paper is to examine the effects of
admixture on the malformation frequencies
from this population. A preliminary report
of a part of these data has been published
previously (Adams and Niswander, 1968).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

the birth records of all American Indians
and the Alaskan natives born in Indian

Health Service hospitals were obtained for
this study. The Indian Health Service operates a system of 51 hospitals. The inpatient capacities of these facilities range
from 6 to 276 beds (Figure 1). All use an
identical recording form which includes a
newborn physical examination section completed by the attending physician. A discharge summary containing parental tribal
affiliation, residence, and other vital statistics, along with a list of coded diagnoses
and/or operative procedures relating to the
infant was also available.

We estimate that approximately one-half
of all American Indian births occur within
the Indian Health Service (IHS) hospital
system, More than 95 per cent of those
families residing on federal reservations or
within the 51 service unit areas utilize the
IHS hospitals. The majority of those births
for which we have no record represent families who have migrated to urban centers or
areas not served by IHS. Many of these
families do receive medical care under contract from local hospitals. However, because
of the nonuniformity in records and reporting systems and the difficulty in defining the base population served by such
hospitals, no attempt was made to include
this source of data.

The sample reported here represents a
nearly complete ascertainment of Indian
live births (95 per cent) on major federal
reservations and therefore should contain
no important ascertainment biases, such as
preferential selection by choosing to utilize
IHS facilities for delivery. The degree of
representativeness of these data compared
to that for nonreservation population is
difficult to define.

marized in Table 1. Newborn records were
not routinely completed for stillborn infants. Because of the gross underreporting
of stillborns and their importance in evaluating malformation frequencies, an attempt was made to supplement the hospital
data. Thus, certificates of all recorded Indian fetal deaths occurring in Arizona between July, 1967, and July, 1969, were
reviewed and tabulated.

The classification of malformations follows that used in a preliminary report
(Adams and Niswander, 1968) and is in
accordance with that of Neel (1958), Stevenson et al. (1966), Morton et al. (1967),
and Woolf and Turner (1969). The designation of a major versus minor abnormality
is arbitrary, but corresponds to these cited
studies.

Since no information was available after
discharge from the hospital, we have no
method by which to assess neonatal deaths
that occurred after hospitalization. Nevertheless, 398 liveborn infants died before
discharge—usually within the first day of
life. This group is referred to as “newborn
deaths.”

The data include 348 twin pairs and one

set of triplets. The twin data will be discussed in detail in another report (Morgan
and Niswander, unpublished).

VARIABLES RELATING TO EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND
GENETIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SAMPLE

The independent variables considered include a variety of indicators and measures
of social, medical, demographic, and genetic
factors with potential influence on pregnancy outcome. Specifically, we included
sex of the infant, year of birth, maternal
age, number of previous pregnancies, absence of prenatal care, legitimacy, maternal
serology, nonhospital birth, residence (on
and off reservation), and endogamy (parents of same or different linguistic group).
If no information pertaining to the father
appeared on the records, the birth was

 

considered illegitimate. Infants born outside of IHS hospitals, but admitted within
48 hours received regular newborn records.

The newborn record contains space for
recording tribal affiliation of both mother
and father. If the parents were of different
tribes, the child was arbitrarily assigned to
the father’s tribe. Since 95 different tribal
groups were encountered, it was necessary
to classify tribes into more discrete groups.
The tribes were grouped by major language
families following classifications given by
Hodge (1912), Swanton (1925), and Wissler (1938). Six specific language groups
were delineated: Aleut-Eskimo, Athabascan, Algonquian, Iroquoi-Muskhogean, Hokan-Siouan, and Uto-Aztecan. These six
groups encompassed over 90 per cent of the
sample with “other” and non-Indians com

prising the remainder. The original geographic distribution of these language
groups was modified from Underhill (1953)
and is shown in Figure 2. The eight language groups were coded by use of seven
“dummy” variables indicating deviations
from the Uto-Aztecans (Uto-Aztecan, X1—
Xz = 0; Athabascan, Xy = 1, Xo--X7 — 0;
Aleut-Eskimo, xX a 0, X2= 1 ; N3-k7 =
0; etc.).

Information relating to non-Indian admixture was available from the newborn
record as “degree of Indian blood” and was
recorded as a fraction for each parent. For
analytic purposes, the degree of Indian
blood was coded in eights (0, non-Indian;
8, full blood) with the infant scored as the
average of the parents. If the degree of

blood was recorded in finer fractions, it was
arbitrarily rounded down to the nearest
one-eighth. Since ABO and Rh blood types
of the mother are included on the newborn
record, it was possible to obtain an overall
appraisal of the reliability of the stated
degree of blood. For each mother’s degreeof-blood category (0-8), frequencies of the
B and r alleles were calculated. Assuming
that both alleles are absent in pure Indians
and that all intermixture was Caucasian,
admixture estimates were calculated for
each “blood” category using 0.074 and
0.387 as the respective Caucasian frequencies of B and r. A high degree of correlation was obtained between stated degree
of blood and admixture estimates based
upon blood typing (Figure 3). Although the

degree of blood clearly underestimates admixture, particularly at the lower levels, it
does appear that degree of blood is a justifiable measure of intermixture.

In addition to the general descriptive
data presented, we have employed stepwise
regression to analyze total as well as selected specific malformation rates for effects
of (1) linguistic groups, (2) medical-cultural variables, and (3) non-Indian intermixture. Our approach was first to test for
differences between linguistic groups using
the seven “dummy” variables (as previously mentioned). This procedure considers
variation among groups in the regression
model. After linguistic group variables were
added, the various significant medical-cultural variables were added in stepwise
fashion, The next step was to introduce the

child’s degree of blood into the regression
equation. If the effect of the child’s admixture was not significant, the analysis was
terminated. If the child’s degree of blood
was significant, we introduced the square of
this term and tested for deviation from additivity; then as a separate procedure, we
entered the mother’s degree of blood to
obtain information regarding maternal effects. This methodology results in a test of
genetic admixture which is to an extent free
of concomitant environmental variation.

figure compares closely with a frequency of
2.06 per cent found by Woolf and Turner
(1969) in the nursery records of liveborn
infants at the Latter-Day Saints Hospital
in Salt Lake City, Utah. However, it is considerably higher than the 1.02 per cent observed among Japanese by Neel (1958) or
the overall frequency of 1.27 per cent recorded by Stevenson et al. (1966) from 24
World Health Organization centers.

Excluding multiple births, there were
43,526 infants recorded in the study. These
births represent 33,755 different mothers
and 8,874 sibships or half-sibships of two
or more infants. A listing of the major malformations occurring within the same sibship is given in Table 3. In only seven cases

was there more than one affected child born
to the same mother, Major genes are certainly indicated in the two instances of
albinism and possibly for polydactly. The
occurrence of this large number of sibs in
the sample creates a potential problem for
analysis. However, the very low recurrence
rates involved suggest that such a factor
will have very little effect on the overall
results, and therefore it has not been considered in further analyses.

Among the 119 stillbirths reported, ten
(8.14 per cent) were malformed. Since this
small sample of stillbirths is likely to be
biased with respect to malformation, we
examined fetal death certificates for Indians
reported in Arizona for the years under
study. During this period, 20,559 Indian
births were reported in Arizona with 247
(12.0/1,000) stillbirths recorded. Of these
births, 11,466 occurred in IHS hospitals
and 126 (10.6/1,000) were stillborn. A

Mean frequencies for specific malformations among different linguistic groups are
given in Table 5. Results of regression
analysis for various malformation categories
and newborn death are given in Table 6.
Although a number of statistically significant effects are noted, the R?’s are all quite
low, indicating that, collectively, the variables studied have little predictive value
with respect to the individual infant.

DISCUSSION
MAJOR MALFORMATIONS

The most striking aspect of these data
with regard to total major malformation is
the variation between the different linguistic groups. The observed frequencies range
from 2.6 per cent in the Aleut-Eskimo
group to 1.3 per cent in the Uto Aztecans.
These difference are highly significant
(F oo. 93,075) = 42743 P< 0.001).

The two-fold differences which we observe between subgroups of Indians, a
Mongoloid population, ascertained in a
relatively homogeneous hospital system in
a single study are difficult to reconcile with
Neel’s assertion of similar frequencies of

total malformations for Caucasian and
Mongolian populations. The frequencies of
specific malformations tend to vary between
linguistic groups more or less independent
of total malformation frequency. A notable
exception is congenital heart disease which
parallels total malformation frequency with
respect to linguistic groups.

Major malformations were more frequent
in males and increased in later births and
among infants born outside the hospital.
The effect of nonhospital births is most
likely due to ascertainment bias in that a
malformed infant born at home is more
likely to be hospitalized than a normal
child. No effect of admixture was detected.

MULTIPLE MALFORMATIONS

Multiple malformations, including those
involving the same system, comprised 9.8
per cent of all malformed infants, while
those involving different systems made up
7.1 per cent. This figure is in close agreement with other studies (e.g., Woolf and
Turner, 1969; Neel, 1958; Chung and
Myrianthopoulos, 1968). Significant positive effects were noted for later year of
birth and advancing maternal age, but no
effect of intermixture was found.

NEWBORN DEATH

As stated earlier, our classification of
newborn death represents liveborn infants
who survived for varying periods of time,
but died before hospital discharge. It cannot be equated with neonatal death as
usually defined. Significant differences occurred among linguistic groups. The frequency of death increased with year of
birth, birth order, and illegitimacy. There
is a highly significant decrease in newborn
death associated with the occurrence of
prenatal care. This effect has been discussed
in a previous report (Iba et al., 1973) in
which it was also found that birth weight

was lower when the mother did not receive
prenatal care.

MINOR MALFORMATIONS

Differences regarding minor malformations were found among linguistic groups
as well as by year of birth and legitimacy
status. However, because of the variability
in definition and reporting, these data are
not considered reliable.

CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEFECTS

No significant effects were found in this
category which is perhaps due to the relatively small numbers involved. Neel (1958)
has previously emphasized that relatively
low frequencies of anencephaly and spina
bifida appear to be characteristic of the
Mongoloid race in general. Morton (1970)
suggested that these low frequencies may
in part be due to the low representation of
stillbirths in the Mongoloid groups which
have been studied. We have attempted to
gain some additional information on this
question by supplementing our present data
with fetal death certificates for Indian
births in Arizona for the years covered by
our hospital records.

For the period from July, 1964, to June,
1969, there were 11,344 live births in IHS
hospitals in Arizona and 122 fetal death
certificates recorded for these hospitals.
Among these 11,466 births, there were 14
cases of midline neurological malformations
recorded: 11 cases with spina bifida, two
with encephaloceles, and one with anencephaly, for a total frequency of 1.22/
1,000. This frequency is similar to that
among Japanese in Hawaii as reported by
Morton (1970) and approximately four
times higher that that reported by Miller
(1964) for Indians in British Columbia.
Nevertheless, the Indian frequency remains
considerably lower than that for Caucasians
after including the frequency in stillbirths.
There is no evidence from our data to sug
Congenital Malformations

 

213

gest that our intermediate frequencies are
the result of Caucasian admixture (Table
5). On the contrary, the highest rates occur among the Athabascans (Table 4) who
tend to be among the least intermixed of the
Indians in the United States. Based on B
and r allele frequencies, the Athabascans
show an average Caucasian admixture of
17 per cent, whereas all other groups collectively average 30 per cent admixture.

CLEFT LIP WITH OR WITHOUT
CLEFT PALATE—CI(P)

As previously reported (Niswander and
Adams, 1967), the frequency of Cl(P) in
American Indians is intermediate between
that of Japanese and Caucasian—-1.7/1,000
compared to 2.13 and 1.2/1,000, respectively. In this regard, we note that the only
significant effect found in Table 5 for C1(P)
is that of the child’s degree of blood. There
is no evidence of nonlinearity or maternal
degree of blood. These findings are compatible with a high degree of genetic determination by multiple genes with additive
effects and thus tend to support the multifactorial threshold model.

ISOLATED CLEFT PALATE (Cp)

A significant positive relationship was
found between CP and maternal age. This
finding is in agreement with results reported
by Hay (1967) who also found a significant
parental-age effect for Cl(P). She also
noted in her data that the parental-age effect was most pronounced for those clefts
which occured in conjunction with other
major malformations. The only other significant maternal age effect in our data is
for the multiple malformation category.

DOWN’S SYNDROME

Significant effects were found for increasing birth order, nonhospital birth, and illegitimacy. The birth-order effect represents
the well-documented effect in which the

214

frequency of Down’s syndrome increases
with increasing maternal age. Since maternal age and birth order are highly correlated and individually are both highly
significant, it appears that birth order was
entered first in the stepwise procedure,
reducing the effect of maternal age to nonsignificance. Therefore, the significance of
birth order rather than maternal age in
Table 5 is probably of chance occurrence,
reflecting this well-documented association
of Down’s syndrome with maternal age.

POLYDACTLY

A more detailed description of polydactly
in these infants has been published elsewhere (Bingle and Niswander, 1974). The
overall incidence of 2.4/1,000 is approximately twice that reported for Caucasians
(Woolf and Woolf, 1970; Woolf and
Myrianthopoulos, 1973). As shown in Table 5, there is significant effect of sex, with
males being most frequently affected. Infants born outside the hospitals and later
admitted were more frequently affected
than those born in the hospital. This finding presumably reflects an ascertainment
bias characterized by a tendency to seek
medical consultation for an infant with a
recognizable anomaly. We also found a significant positive effect of non-Indian admixture with a suggestion of a maternal
effect. In view of the known genetic heterogeneity in polydactly, the interpretation
of such a finding is unclear.

CLUBFOOT

The term “clubfoot” is imprecise and,
as commonly employed, includes three etiologically distinct entities, namely, talipes
equinovarus, metatarsus varus, and talipes
calcaneovalgus, as well as a number of other
less frequently occurring entities which are
often poorly defined and may be relatively
mild. Unfortunately, the newborn records
did not always include a description adequate for precise classification, but an at
 

Niswander, Barrow, and Bingle

Social Biology

tempt was made to limit the diagnosis of
“clubfoot” to those entities which were
either adequately described or appeared to
represent definite abnormalities of a serious
nature.

Among infants born in Hawaii, Morton
et al. (1967) and Morton (1970) reported
a higher frequency of clubfoot (primarily
talipes equinovarus) in Caucasians than in
Orientals. These findings were later confirmed by Ching et al. (1969). WynneDavies (1965) reported a total frequency
in England of 4.04/1,000 for talipes equinovarus, metatarsus varus, and _talipes
calcaneovalgus. Our observed frequency of
1.8/1,000 among Indians in conjunction
with the Hawaiian studies suggests that a
low incidence of clubfoot is characteristic
of Mongoloids in general. However, defintive conclusions are complicated by our
inability to adequately subdivide our data
by diagnostic categories.

Ching et al. (1969) found significant
racial effects, which were predominantly
additive, for talipes equinovarus but no
racial variation in the incidence of metatarsus varus. Moreover, they found inconsistent racial effects for talipes calcaneovalgus
which were interpreted as suggestive of
nongenetic factors. We found no significant
effects of any of the socio-environmental
variables, which is consistent with their
findings for talipes equinovarus; however,
they did find a significant effect of maternal age on the incidence of metatarsus
varus and an effect of father’s occupation
on talipes calcaneovalgus. Thus, while certain similarities exist between our results
and those of previous studies, sound conclusions are hindered by the quality of our
data.

CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

Because of the uncertainty of the diagnosis in the neonate and the heterogeneity
within this group of defects, our data are
of very limited usefulness. For the present

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

Vol. 22, No. 3

report, we have eliminated all Grade I or
II murmurs unless associated with cyanosis
or abnormal X-ray findings, but have included all other cases even though they
were unspecified as to type. As previously
noted, the relative frequency of heart defects among linguistic groups tends to parallel the total malformation frequency. The
significance of this finding is unclear. No
significant effects were found in the regression analysis.

SUMMARY

Major malformations were found to occur with a frequency of 18.4 per 1,000
American Indian births in Indian Health
Service hospitals. Among the subgroups of

Congenital Malformations

215

Indians, based upon linguistic affiliation,
highly significant differences in overall malformation frequencies were noted. These
frequencies ranged from 1.31 per cent to
2.63 per cent. In view of this finding, we
suggest that the apparent uniformity of
malformation rates among different races
and other diverse population groups may
be more fortuitous than of biologic significance.

Compared to Caucasians, Indians have
a greater frequency of cleft lip with or
without cleft palate and polydactly and
have a lower frequency of clubfoot and
central nervous system abnormalities. These
results are in agreement with the findings
of studies on other Mongoloid populations.
