Lalor Foundation Research Fellowship Program for 1976

The Lalor Foundation has announced its
1976 program of postdoctorate grants for
research in special areas of mammalian
reproductive physiology.

The Foundation will make grants up to
$13,500 each to qualified tax-exempt institutions for conduct of approved projects
up to one year. Foreign institutions can in
general achieve a similar eligibility.

The applicant institution has the obligation and freedom to make its own designation of a Lalor Fellow for conduct of the
research from among its own personnel or
elsewhere. The Fellow designated should
have achievement at least equivalent to the

Ph.D. or M.D. degree. Upper age limit is
35 years.

Applications are restricted to research
projects bearing on: (a) early amniocentesis in fetal development, or other means for
detection and evaluation of dysgenic factors or congenital disabilities, and means
toward their disposition; or (&) uterine
and cervical physiology and phenomena
relevant to pregnancy interruption, particularly for second trimester terminations.

Forms and details for institution application are available from the Lalor Foundation, 4400 Lancaster Pike, Wilmington,
Delaware, 19805.
