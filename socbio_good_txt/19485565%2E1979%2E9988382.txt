Correlates of Attitudes Toward Euthanasia

ABSTRACT: Data from a national survey conducted in 1977 were examined to identify correlates of
attitudes toward euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons. The results indicated that race,
religious participation, and attitudes toward freedom of expression were directly associated with
such attitudes. It was also found that regional variations in such attitudes could be explained by the

degree of urbanization of geographic regions.

The issue of euthanasia has become
more prominent recently because of advances in medical technology which can
prolong life, social changes in which death
with dignity has become a major issue,
and because of considerable attention being paid by mass media to the issues of
death and dying. However, the legal,
moral, and social implications of the right
to die have never been fully clarified. The
issue of euthanasia is somewhat different
than the issue of death since it involves rational decision-making on the part of patients, their families, and their physicians.
There is also the question of whether a
person who is terminally ill has the right to
simply take his or her own life or whether
this should always be done in consultation
with a physician or a board of physicians.

It should be noted that although euthanasia poses a moral dilemma for most
people, public approval of euthanasia has
increased over the years (Benton, 1978).
This increasing approval is crucial, since
the legal, moral, and technological issues
cannot be resolved if the citizenry is
greatly divided on the subject of euthanasia. However, the patterns of approval

and disapproval of euthanasia vary depending on the sociodemographic, socioeconomic, religious, and ideological
characteristics of respondents included in
previous studies. For example, previous
studies suggest that older, less educated,
and black respondents are likely to be opposed to euthanasia (Adams et al., 1978;
Dempsey, 1975; Kalish, 1963; Kloper and
Price, 1978). Sex differences have generally not been found to be relevant.
Perhaps the most important predictors
of attitudes toward euthanasia are found
to be embedded within the religious behaviors of respondents. Previous studies
are conclusive in suggesting that those
who are more religious (measured either
through multidimensional measures or a
single dimension measure such as attendance at religious services) are generally
more opposed to euthanasia (Adams et al.,
1978; Beswick, 1970; Fletcher, 1977;
Jorgenson and Neubecker, 1979; Russell,
1975; Schultz, 1978; Wilson, 1975).
Whether differences based on religious
affiliation may be relevant is subject to
question since most religions explicitly endorse the sacredness of life. However,

247

since the frequency of attendance in religious services is generally higher among
Catholics, it is possible to hypothesize a
difference between Catholics and nonCatholics on the issue of euthanasia.

An issue not addressed in previous research on attitudes toward euthanasia is
that of freedom of expression and the
ideological component in general that
may be highly relevant to such attitudes.
The choice of euthanasia of suicide on the
part of a terminally ill person is his or her
own option. People opposed to freedom
of expression may also be likely to be opposed to euthanasia and perhaps even
more opposed to a terminally ill person
opting for suicide. Attitudes toward euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons may be influenced by such factors as
one’s commitment to freedom of expression for others and political views, since
such attitudes involve decisions about
freedom of choice (Williams et al., 1976).

The purpose of the present research is
to examine patterns of approval and disapproval of euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons. The sample to be analyzed is a fu)l probability sample of
noninstitutionalized adult Americans.
The analysis of public opinion on the issue
of euthanasia and suicide is highly important since the weight of public opinion will
eventually determine the legislative, medical-ethical, and religious questions about
these issues that will need to be resolved.

The study differs from previous studies
in two respects. First, it examines simultaneously the issues of euthanasia and
suicide for terminally ill persons. Second,
it incorporates the ideological components deemed essential for analysis of such
attitudes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for this study were derived
from the 1977 general social survey conducted by the National Opinion Research
Center as part of the national data pro

gram for social sciences. The survey was
based on a full probability sample of clusters of households in the continental United States with 1,530 respondents. ‘ However, a number of exclusions reduced the
sample size to 1,398. First, respondents
other than black or white were excluded.
Second, a respondent must have answered
questions on both euthanasia and suicide
to be included in the analysis. The regression analysis is based on 1,292 respondents because of listwise deletions.”

IssuES OF EUTHANASIA AND SUICIDE

Two questions requiring yes/no responses tapped attitudes toward euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons.
The first question asked respondents if
they thought that doctors should be allowed by law to end a patient’s life by
some painless means if an incurably ill patient and his family requested it. The second question asked: “Do you think a person has the right to end his or her own life
if this person has an incurable disease?”

INDEPENDENT MEASURES

A number of independent measures
were used based on their prior usage in examining euthanasia attitudes. These variables can be categorized into broad categories of sociodemographic, socioeconomic, religious, and ideological dimensions. Sociodemographic dimensions included age, race, sex, and place of
residence. The indicators of socioeconomic status were education and
family income. Three indicators of religious behavior were religious affiliation
(Catholic/non-Catholic), attendance at

religious services (ranging from never to

‘For details of-sampling design, see the National
Opinion Research Center codebook for the 1977 survey. The respondents were English-speaking persons 18 years of age or over living in noninstitutional settings within the continental United States.

Listwise deletion means that an observation is

_excluded if the data on any of the variables in the

equation are missing.

several times a week), and commitment to
religious beliefs (strong/not strong).°

Two ideological dimensions were also
included, based on the premise that attitudes toward euthanasia and suicide constituted part of one’s political ideology
and were related to attitudes toward
freedom of expression. Political ideology
was a self-labeling item, and respondents
categorized themselves as liberals, moderates or conservatives. Freedom of expression was a summed scale of attitudes toward freedom of speech for atheists,
militants, and communists. Respondents
who would permit freedom for all three
were considered permitting total freedom
of expression, and those who disapproved
of freedom for all three were considered
permitting no freedom of expression.
Those who approved of freedom of speech
for one or two but not all three constituted
the middle category.

Aside from the above variables, regional variations were also considered.


3The variable of religious commitment or commitment to religious beliefs was based on the question “Would you call yourself a strong (religious
preference named) or a not very strong (religious
preference named)?”’ Those who indicated no religious preference were categorized with the “not very
Strong” group. ~

Descriptive labels for these variables and
regroupings appear in Tables 1 through 3.

RESULTS

Table 1 reports regional variations in
the percentage approval of euthanasia and
suicide. There were wide geographic variations in attitudes toward euthanasia and
suicide. A low of 53 per cent of respondents in the West North Central region
and a high of 79 per cent of respondents in
the Pacific region approved of euthanasia.
The range for approval of suicide was
from a low of 29.4 per cent in the West
South Central region to a high of 56.5 per
cent in the Pacific region. Geographic regions with proportionately higher urban
populations were more likely to approve
of both euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons.

In examining the variations in these attitudes on the basis of selected indicators,
we found that as age increased approval of
euthanasia as well as suicide declined.
There were wide variations between
males and females and between whites
and blacks on the issue of euthanasia as
well as of suicide. Females and blacks
were least likely to approve of euthanasia
and suicide. Differences on the basis of

place of residence were not significant for
euthanasia although they were significant
for suicide. It was evident that bettereducated persons were more likely to approve of both euthanasia and suicide.
However, on the basis of family income,
approval by the upper-income category
was somewhat lower than that by the middie-income category.

There were no significant differences in
attitudes on the basis of religious
affiliation, but considerable differences on
the bases of attendance at religious services and of religious commitment (see
Table 3). Those who attended religious
services more frequently and those who
felt strongly commited to their religious

beliefs showed a Jower degree of approval
of both euthanasia and suicide. Although
political identification was not an indicator of attitudes toward euthanasia, it was
an indicator of attitudes toward suicide.
The index of freedom of expression was a
very clear indicator of attitudes toward euthanasia and suicide. Generally, those
who approved of freedom of expression
were likely to approve of euthanasia and
suicide.

The extent to which one approved of
suicide for persons with an incurable disease was also likely to be predictive of
one’s attitude toward euthanasia. As
noted in Table 3, those who approved of
suicide also approved of euthanasia 87 out.

did approve of euthanasia.

In order to understand the relative contributions of these variables, we performed two analyses. The results reported
in Table 4 indicated that age, sex, place of
residence, religious affiliation, socioeconomic indicators (education and income), and political identification had no
direct effects on attitudes toward euthanasia except for their contributions through
other variables. The variables of direct

predictive significance were race, attendance at religious services, religious commitment, and freedom of expression. The
results indicated that blacks were less
likely to approve of euthanasia as were
those who showed a stronger degree of
commitment to their religious beliefs and
those who attended religious services with
a greater frequency. It was also indicated
that those who opposed freedom of expression for atheists, militants, and communists were also likely to oppose euthanasia. Addition of suicide approval as a

variable in the model increased the predictive efficiency as well as criterion variance
explanation considerably.

These factors were also important in
determining the attitudes toward suicide
for terminally ill persons. The variables
found important for direct predictive purposes were race, place of residence, attendance at religious services, religious commitment, political views, and the freedom
of expression index. The criterion variance was primarily explained by attendance at religious services and the
freedom of expression index. The indicators of socioeconomic status did not make
significant direct contributions toward understanding attitudes toward suicide for
terminally ill persons.

Although the variables of age and education were not found to have direct predictive significance, they have indirect
effects through the freedom of expression
index. In each instance, the correlations
were 0,35 in absolute value, suggesting that

expression ideology. Thus, it is likely that
if the freedom-of-expression index is deleted from the model, the effects of age
and education will become prominent.
However, similar observations cannot be
made about sex since its correlations with
variables which have direct effects were
generally less than 0.09. The effects of age
were also likely to be mediated through
the variable of attendance at religious
services since the zero-order correlation
between age and attendance was 0.18,
i.e., older respondents attended religious
services more frequently. The effects of
family income would become relevant in
the same way as the effects of education.
However, the correlation of income with
freedom of expression was only 0.26 in absolute value.

tional sample. The results indicated that
race, religious behavior, and attitudes toward freedom of expression were important predictors in both instances. It also
found that there were significant regional
variations, and the general pattern appeared to be that those regions which were
less urbanized were less likely to approve
of euthanasia and suicide. It is important
to note that approval of euthanasia as well
as of suicide are part of one’s general
orientation toward freedom of expres<sion, and those who approve of freedom

others but disapproved of abortion for
themselves (or their wives) for economic
reasons (Singh, 1978). Assuming that to
some extent a similar response might hold
in these instances, the attitudes toward euthanasia and suicide, then, cannot be used
as a guide for projecting demands for euthanasia and suicide for terminally ill persons.

It should be also noted that with an increasing tolerance of freedom of expression, which is a direct by-product of education, approval of euthanasia as well as of
suicide is likely to increase. Moral and legal dilemmas, then, would have to be resolved, given that the public sentiment already favors euthanasia. Many bioethical
questions would have to be confronted in
order to arrive at laws and regulations
governing administration of euthanistic
methods. At the same time, many sociobiological issues would have to be
clarified in terms of the roles of physicians,
patients, and family members in euthanistic procedures.
