Effects of Sociodemographic Variables on
Adult Mortality in the United States:
Comparisons by Sex, Age, and Cause of Death

ABSTRACT: The effects of sociodemographic variables on mortality for U.S. adults are estimated,
using data from the National Health Interview Survey matched with National Death Index
data. Dependent variables of the proportional hazards models include all-cause mortality and
mortality due to circulatory disease, lung cancer, breast cancer, other cancer, other medical
causes, and nonmedical causes. Results indicate that all of the sociodemographic variables (education, income, employment status, marital status, race) have independent effects on all-cause
mortality, with similar-effect sizes for males and females, and weaker effects in the older group
(ages 65+) than the younger (ages 25-64). For the separate causes of death, the effects of most

sociodemographic variables vary by sex.

Demographic and economic differentials in mortality in the United States have
been documented by numerous studies
throughout the century, with Kitagawa

and Hauser’s (1973) analysis of matched.

census/death record data being one of the
benchmark studies. That study reported
education and income differentials on allcause mortality (ACM) and education differentials on separate causes of death as
of 1960. Subsequent multivariate studies
of U.S. population data during the past
twenty years have shown that education,
income, employment status, marital status, and race/ethnicity sometimes have independent effects on the risk of ACM
(Bucher and Ragland, 1995; Mott and
Haurin, 1985; Otten et al., 1990; Rogers,
1995; Smith and Waitzman, 1994; Sorlie
et al., 1995). A few studies have looked at
the extent to which the effects of sociodemographic variables (education, most
often) on ACM or heart disease mortality
vary by age-sex subgroups. Most find a
weaker effect of sociodemographic vari
ables in the elderly population compared
with the younger population, although results have been inconsistent (Jefferys,
1996). Some studies have reported sex
differences in the effects of education, depending on the time period studied (Christenson and Johnson, 1995; Feldman et al.,
1989; Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973).

Less is known, even on a descriptive
level, about the effects of various sociodemographic variables on separate causes
of death and the degree to which these effects vary by age-sex subgroup. The effects of sociodemographic variables may
be large for some causes of death and
nonexistent for others, and the observed
patterns of effects can shed light on the
linkages between sociodemographic variables and ACM.

The present study uses a relatively new
national data set to estimate the independent effects of socioeconomic and demographic variables on a few major causes of
death and the extent to which these effects
vary by age-sex group. The sociodemo
136

graphic independent variables include education, income, employment status, marital status, and race. The dependent variables are the hazard rates of death from six
broad causes.

Education, the main sociodemographic
variable in Kitagawa and Hauser’s (1973)
benchmark study, reflects several economic and noneconomic factors, some of
which include income potential, working
conditions, social-psychological resources,
fnowledge of risk factors and the health

re system, and health behaviors (Ross
and Wu, 1995). Past research has been inConsistent about the effect of education on
Fortality and how the effect varies by sex.
While education is the preferred measure
€f socioeconomic status (SES) in this data
set, I also look at income and employment
‘sfatus (working vs. not working) as deter4Rinants or correlates of mortality. Like
€ducation, income and employment status

ve shown significant effects on a variety
of health conditions as well as on mortal‘fy in past studies. The effects of these
SES variables are compared across the
Sfferent causes of death, and across age‘SEX groups.

rough multiple proximate determinants,
Bas been difficult to resolve (Marmot et
a., 1984; Preston and Taubman, 1994) and
cannot be addressed in this study. SES,
however, can be considered a “fundamental cause” reflecting access to key social
resources, which can establish a long-term
link between SES and mortality despite
changing proximate determinants (Link
and Phelan, 1995; Williams and Collins,
1995).

The risk of mortality is generally lower
for married people than for unmarried,
perhaps due to better health habits, greater

social support, and sometimes higher income. Selection may also be part of the
explanation, if persons already in poor
health are less likely to get married or are
more likely to get divorced. Most research
indicates a larger beneficial effect of marriage for males than for females on allcause mortality (Rogers, 1995) and a
smaller effect for older people than for
younger (Sorlie et al., 1995). The present
study explores these patterns for a few
different causes of death.

The question of whether race/ethnicity
has “independent” effects on mortality
risk, and whether race/ethnicity effects can
be explained by other sociodemographic
variables, especially SES, has been examined in the past with mixed results (Christenson and Johnson, 1995; Lillard and
Waite, 1995; Mott and Haurin, 1985; Otten et al., 1990; Rogers, 1992; Sorlie et al.,
1995). The present study adds to this body
of research by testing for the net effects of
black/white race on a few causes of death,
by age and sex. Like SES, race/ethnicity
may have generalized effects and may also
be considered a fundamental cause of mortality, in as much as discrimination and access to resources are a function of race/
ethnicity, independent of SES.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA

The National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) is an annual household survey of
the civilian noninstitutionalized population
of the United States, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
The National Death Index (NDI) ts a database of all deaths in the United States
since 1979, also maintained by NCHS. I
merged annual NHIS data sets for the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

years 1987-90 with NDI death certificate
data (through 1991), using a linkage
mechanism provided by NCHS (National
Center for Health Statistics, 1994). The resulting data set (referred to as NHIS-NDI)
contains sociodemographic characteristics
of NHIS respondents and, if deceased, their
time and cause of death (underlying and
contributing causes) through the end of
1991. For example, 1987 NHIS respondents are observed through the end of 1991
and may die at any time during that four- to
five-year period (depending on their 1987
interview date). Similarly, 1990 NHIS respondents are observed through the end of
1991 and can die at any time during the
one- to two-year period. The data for this
study are limited to blacks and whites, ages
25 and over, who have nonmissing data on
the covariates (except for income, which I
imputed when missing, using a multiple regression model). I used a 10 per cent random sample of survivors and all of the
deaths (as discussed later), yielding a final
sample size of 39,719 (11,041 deaths and
28,678 survivors).

Dependent variables:—Causes of death
are categorized into six groups: circulatory
disease (including cerebrovascular), lung
cancer, breast cancer, other cancer, other
medical causes (other than the previous
causes), and nonmedical causes (accidents,
homicide, suicide). The categories were
coded using the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
and are based on the underlying cause of
death. The categories, except for lung cancer and breast cancer, are clearly heterogeneous, but sample size (number of deaths)
was a consideration with models being run
by age-sex subgroup.

Independent variables:—Education 1s
measured with three categories: college
graduate (“high”), high-school graduate

 

Social Biology

and/or some college (“medium’’), and less
than high-school (“low”). A preliminary
cross-tabular analysis showed no difference between high-school graduates and
the “some-college” group on any cause of
death or on ACM. This lack of difference
is consistent with other empirical studies
of mortality as well as other outcomes.
Race is measured with two categories—
black and white. Marital status is represented by three categories: never-married;
divorced, separated, or widowed (DSW);
and married. I combined the categories (1)
divorced/separated and (2) widowed for
sample-size reasons and because no difference in effect was found between these
two categories in my analysis or in most
other mortality research.! Income is represented by annual family income measured
on a scale derived from the midpoints of
equally-spaced categories. Employment
Status is measured with two categories:
employed (full-time or part-time) and notemployed. The not-employed category includes unemployed (disproportionately in
the 25-64 age group), not in labor force
(many of whom are disabled in the 25-64
age group, but not as much in the older
group), retired (not identifiable per se in
the NHIS), students, and “other.”

Income and Employment status are
“current” measures, with a time reference

The meaning of the category DSW varies across
age-sex groups. A much higher proportion of the older
group (ages 65+) is widowed relative to the younger
group (ages 25-64), and males are more often widowed
than females (especially in the older group).

2Among males ages 25-64, 54 per cent of the “not
in labor force” group are disabled (defined here as “unable to perform major activity”). Among females ages
25-64, 16 per cent are disabled. In the 65+ age group,
20 per cent of the nonworking males and 17 per cent of
the nonworking females are disabled. Labor-force participation rates vary by sex, although in the 65+ age
group the sex difference is only about 6 percentage
points (87 per cent of males not working, 93 per cent of

’ females).

of twelve months or less before the interview date. Current status measures in this
analysis are more susceptible to the confounding influence of (unmeasured) “current” health status, a precursor of subsequent mortality and a potential cause of
current income/employment. Given this
ambiguity in the direction of relationship
between Income and Employment status
with mortality (i.e., possible two-way cau=sation), I treat the Income and Employ“Ment status variables with less emphasis
chan the other independent variables. Edusation is the preferred SES measure beCause it is measured “earlier in time” and
gs more stable over the lifecourse.

MODEL ESTIMATION

ox proportional hazards models are
Gised to estimate the net effects of soAciodemographic variables on the monthly

Sorder to compare effects of sociodemoGraphic variables across groups. Moreover, some dependent variables are not
measured or not relevant for every agesex group (e.g., too few breast cancer
deaths for males; too few “nonmedical”
deaths for the 65+ age group). I used a 10
per cent random sample of survivors and
all of the deaths for the multivariate
analysis (see Table 1), a sampling strategy which allowed for more efficient data
processing while also yielding unbiased
estimates of odds ratios. Parameter esti

mates (odds ratios) were the same as
when using the full sample, according to
preliminary analysis.

Because NHIS is based on a complex
multistage sample design, I used weighted
sample data, based on NCHS-supplied
weights, to calculate the hazard model parameter estimates (odds ratios). With
these parameter estimates (odds ratios), I
calculated significance levels by using
standard errors from unweighted analysis,
since sample weighting usually causes
(upwardly) biased standard errors. On the
other hand, due to the clustering feature
of the sample design, the standard errors
(unweighted) may be underestimated in
some cases. Significance levels should
therefore be considered approximate. However, weighted and unweighted parameter
estimates are very similar and rarely lead to
different significance levels. Computations
were performed with SAS version 6.08
(Base and PHREG).

A note in terminology. In the multivariate analysis (Table 2), a variable is
considered to have an “effect” if its odds
ratio is significant at the 0.05 Jevel, although I pay attention to large odds ratios
which do not reach the 0.05 level (partly
because odds ratios are being compared
across subgroups/models of different
sample sizes). The multivariate results are
discussed in terms of “beneficial” and
“detrimental” effects of independent variables. Education, or being married, for
example, has a “beneficial effect” if the
odds of mortality are reduced by increasing education (or being married), and
“detrimental” if the odds are increased.

RESULTS

The multivariate results (Table 2) are
discussed for each independent variable

separately, with the discussions broken
down by age group. The 25-64 age group
is referred to as “younger” and the 65+
age group as “older.”

EDUCATION

Ages 25-64.—The effects of education
on ACM are similar for males and females
in this age group. Males with high education (college graduates) are 0.71 times less
likely to die than are males with low education; the equivalent odds ratio for females is 0.65. The odds ratios indicate a
gradient for the education effect on ACM
and on most of the separate causes, that is,
a college degree is typically more beneficial than a high-school/some-college education, and so on. What stands out here are
the sex differences in the effects of education on NONMEDICAL and OTHER MEDICAL
causes of death. The effect of education
(particularly “high” education) on NonMEDICAL 1s much stronger for males, while
the (beneficial) education effect on OTHER
MEDICAL Is much stronger for females. The
beneficial education effect on LUNG CANCER is somewhat stronger for males as
well. As for BREAST CANCER among females, education has a “detrimental effect,’ consistent with other studies. How
ever, there is not much of a gradient. College graduates are not at higher risk than
are high-school graduates.

Ages 65 and over—lIn this age group,
education has weaker effects on ACM and
cause-specific mortality for both males
and females. For males only, high education reduces the risk of LUNG CANCER, basically to the same extent as in the
younger group, iLe., there is no decline

with age in the effects of education on

LUNG CANCER. On other causes of death,
the effects of education are close to zero
for older males. For females, however, education has a beneficial and significant effect on CIRCULATORY (but not for males).
Interestingly, high education has a possible “detrimental effect” on LUNG CANCER
for females (OR=1.43), although this
odds ratio is not statistically significant.

INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT STATUS

On ACM, income has significant beneficial effects for all age-sex groups with
the exception of older females. The effects are stronger in the younger groups
for both sexes. Income effects do not vary
significantly by sex, though the odds ratios for males are slightly larger than for
females.

For the separate causes of death, higher
income is associated with better outcomes
for most causes and age-sex subgroups,
though it is not always statistically significant. The income effects are larger in the
younger group than the older group for all

csurprisingly, the effects are smaller for the
cplder age groups, though there ts a larger
~effect on LUNG CANCER for older men rela‘tive to younger. The latter pattern may reSflect reverse causation whereby men with
"dong-term lung cancer have dropped out of
the labor force, with no such pattern ap‘pearing for females because of their lower
fates of labor force participation and lung
atancer. Within age groups, the employ‘ament status effects are generally similar
“for males and females.

‘Seneral, education and marital-status odds
tios are slightly larger before income and
employment status are added to the equation (which applies to most age-sex groups
and causes of death), suggesting that the
total effects of education and marital status
operate partly through income and employment status in affecting the risk of
mortality.

ACM relative to married, while divorced/
separated/widowed (DSW) has a slight yet
significant effect. The effects of being
never-married on separate causes of death
depend on sex: for males, being nevermarried lowers the risk (relative to married) of CIRCULATORY but raises the risk for
females. The direction of effect for males
is unexpected, though not large (OR =
0.74). I explored this relationship with detailed cross-tab tables as well as with models containing interactions (as was done
with all variables in earlier analysis), and
the effect persists within ten-year age
groups, within race groups, and within education groups. It may reflect a process of
competing risks, whereby never-married
males are more likely to die of other
causes, such as OTHER MEDICAL (OR =
3.00). Finally, like the never-married category, DSW’s effects on separate causes of
death depend on sex. For males only,
DSW has a detrimental effect (relative to
married) on NONMEDICAL. For females
only, DSW has a detrimental effect (relative to married) on LUNG CANCER, and
this effect persists in the older group.
DSW also has detrimental effects on CirCULATORY {females only) and OTHER
MEDICAL (males and females), and an unexpected “beneficial” effect on OTHER
CANCER.among males.

Ages 65 and over——NMarital status has
weaker effects on ACM and on causespecific mortality in the older group.
Among males in this age group, DSW
does have a small but significant detrimental effect on ACM (p<0.05) and a
marginal effect on NONMEDICAL (p< 0.10).
Never-married has a marginally significant detrimental effect on CIRCULATORY
in this subgroup, in contrast to its “beneficial” effect in the younger age group.
For older females, there are no marital

status effects on ACM, but DSW raises
the risk of LUNG CANCER. Surprisingly,
being never-married appears to lower the
risk of OTHER MEDICAL, whereas it raises
the risk in the younger group.

RACE

Ages 25-64.—For ACM, _ blacks
(males and females) are about 1.3 times
more likely to die (1.e., 30 per cent higher
risk) after controlling for the other sociodemographic variables. Thus, race does
have net effects on ACM in this analysis.
For separate causes of death, in the male
model blacks are at significantly higher
risk of OTHER MEDICAL (OR= 1.67) and
OTHER CANCER (OR= 1.33), and at marginally higher risk of CIRCULATORY (OR =
1.21). In the female model, the race effect
is significant for BREAST CANCER (OR=
1.75), LUNG CANCER (OR=1.61), and CirCULATORY (OR=1.41). For both sexes, the
odds ratios for race in the ACM models
and separate-cause models are usually
larger before controlling for the other sociodemographic variables (not shown),
suggesting that the latter variables can explain some but not all of the initial bivariate association between race and mortality.
For BREAST CANCER, adding the controls
slightly increases the risk to black women,
given the positive association between education and breast cancer mortality.

Ages 65 and over—For females, race
has significant net effects on ACM and
CIRCULATORY, but for males there are no
net effects of race. The weak effects of race

~ in the older groups are consistent with the

literature on race cross-over mortality patterns (1.e., white mortality exceeds black
mortality at old ages), the causes of which
have yet to be resolved (Nam, 1995).

I conclude the Results section by briefly
shifting the focus from independent vari
Kallan

Social Biology

ables to dependent variables and noting
that each cause of death tends to have its
own set of sociodemographic determinants, as evidenced by the columns of
Table 2. OTHER CANCER stands out as being
relatively unaffected by sociodemographic
variables compared with other broad
causes of death, and this finding applies
to both males and females. On the other
hand, some causes of death have pronounced sex differences in the determinants, especially in the younger group.
LUNG CANCER in males is strongly affected by education (and employment
status) but not by income, marital status,
or race. For females, LUNG CANCER is affected only by race and marital status
(DSW). NONMEDICAL also shows strong
sex differences in determinants. For males,
it is impacted by almost all of the sociodemographic variables except for race,
with its strongest determinants being education and DSW. For females, income is
the only significant determinant of NonMEDICAL. The other causes of death also
have varying determinants according to
sex, but to a lesser degree.

DISCUSSION

This study estimated the net effects of
sociodemographic variables on all-cause
mortality (ACM) and on a few separate
causes of death, with the effects compared across age and sex subgroups. Each
of the soctodemographic variables show
independent effects on ACM, with effects
being similar for males and females but
weaker in the older (ages 65+) group. For
separate causes of death, the effects of
sociodemographic variables are generally
weaker across the board in the older
group, but there is a complex picture of
sex differences in effects.

For the younger age group (ages
25-64), education affects every cause of
death except for OTHER CANCER. Education’s strongest net effects in this age
group are on NONMEDICAL and LUNG
CANCER (for males), OTHER MEDICAL (for
females), and BREAST CANCER (for females, where the effect is “detrimental’).
The lack of an effect of education on

(OTHER CANCER is consistent with other

cowhich is similar to my results. Marotikainen (1995), using a data set of
coFinnish females, found an effect of educa“<tion on CIRCULATORY but not on “non‘breast cancer.” At least for males, my reSeults suggest that education influences
“Sthose causes of death having the largest

ONONMEDICAL. For younger females the

ANCER may reflect fertility-related fac‘Stors—nulliparity or later age at first
irth—although there was no effect of
arital status on BREAST CANCER.
In the older age group, education coninues to show beneficial effects on CirSCULATORY for females but not males.
AFor older males, education still shows a
strong beneficial effect on LUNG CANCER.
For older females, there is a possible
“detrimental” effect of high education on
LUNG CANCER (OR=1.43), though it is not
statistically significant. If other studies
based on larger samples can replicate
such an effect, it would support the idea
that the highest educated women were
more likely to take up smoking several
decades ago than were lowest education
women (Waldron, 1991).

Adult Mortality

Income and employment status show
significant net effects on ACM and causespecific mortality for most age-sex groups.
The effects are generally stronger in the
younger groups (both sexes) and similar
for males and females.

The results for marital status show that
the never-married and DSW are at higher
risk of ACM and most causes of death
than are the married, especially in the
younger group. There are fairly large sex
differences in the net effects of marital
status, with effects usually being larger
for males, consistent with research cited
earlier. Especially for younger males, the
never-married group are at much higher
risk of OTHER MEDICAL (relative to married). Also for males (but not females),
being DSW has a large detrimental effect
(relative to married) on NONMEDICAL.
This pattern, and the fact that education
also has a greater effect for males than for
females on NONMEDICAL, may reflect
greater risk-taking behavior among less
educated and/or divorced males, though it
is also possible that greater risk behavior
is a precursor of divorce (Smith and
Waitzman, 1994), It is not clear why this
pattern appears for males but not females.
Finally, for females only (both younger
and older), DSW has a detrimental effect
(relative to married) on LUNG CANCER.

In a few cause-specific models, the
never-married appear to have a lower
mortality risk, as in CIRCULATORY for
younger males. Whether this reflects a
competing risk process, a selectivity process, or is significant by chance cannot be
resolved here. Smith and Waitzman
(1994), using the NHANES I data, reported no significant effect of nevermarried relative to married on the risk of CIRCULATORY for younger males, although
the sign was in the detrimental direction.

They did find a detrimental effect of
never-married for younger females, which
is similar to my results. Rogers (1995)
found a detrimental net effect of nevermarried on CIRCULATORY for males but
not females. As for my finding of a net effect of never-married on OTHER MEDICAL
for older females, no other studies are
available for comparison, although the
Smith and Waitzman (1994) study reported
fairly large (but not significant) beneficial
net effects of never-married on ACM and
on CIRCULATORY among older females.
That study also reported a significant “beneficial” effect of never-married (and widowed) on risk of cancer mortality among
low-income men. My results show a similar effect on OTHER CANCER for men of age
group 25-64.

The results show significant net effects
of race on ACM among all age-sex groups
with the exception of older males. Looking at separate causes of death among
younger males, I find race is significant for
three causes and marginally significant
for one. In this age-sex group, the largest
net effect of race is on OTHER MEDICAL
(OR = 1.67), due largely to the higher rate
of infectious disease mortality among
black men, and to a lesser extent due to
their higher rate of diabetes mortality (not
shown). For younger fernales, race is significant for three causes, and marginally significant for one: BREAST CANCER (OR = 1.75),
LUNG CANCER (OR=1.61), CIRCULATORY
(OR=1.41), and OTHER MEDICAL (OR =
1.24, p<0.10). In the older age group, the
race effects are weaker for both sexes and
significant only for females (on ACM and
CIRCULATORY). Thus, in general, the net ef
Kallan

fects of race are weaker in the older age
groups, but similar for males and females
of the same age group.

The extent to which race/ethnicity effects on mortality (and health) can be explained by SES and other variables has
always been an important yet difficult
question. My models reveal a nontrivial
residual race effect, as do some other
multivariate studies. There are several
individual-level and contextual variables
that, if measurable in this study, would
probably reduce the race “effect” to zero.
Wealth, income stability, residential segregation, physical environment and neighborhood quality, access to quality medical care, and discrimination (which cuts
across all of the above) need further
study. Some studies already find that race
differences in ACM disappear when income and demographic variables are controlled (Rogers, 1992). Rogers’ study
used a different research design and data
set, and the data/models were not presented by age or by sex. Further research
in this area is needed to create a body of
findings that can be analyzed as a whole.

While it is likely that SES, race/ethnicity, and marital status have both “generalized” and specific effects on mortality
risk (Marmot et al., 1984), analysis of
this issue is beyond the scope of this
study. The fact that SES and other
sociodemographic variables have been
shown in previous studies to affect allcause mortality, even after controlling for
proximate determinants or medical risk
factors, may be partly due to their generalized effects, in addition to measurement
etror in socioeconomic variables (Preston

 
 

Vol. 44, No. 1-2

and Taubman, 1994). Sociodemographic
variables may affect overall (generalized)
mortality risk via mechanisms such as immunity and stress, knowledge of risk factors,
health behavior (especially smoking), and

diet. Data containing medical and behavioral proximate determinants (such as
smoking) as well as detailed causes of
death (and larger samples) should be used
to explore those issues.
