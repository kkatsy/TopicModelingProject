Human Color Vision Deficiencies
and Atmospheric Twilight

ABSTRACT: Red-green color vision deficiencies in human populations are generally regarded as
visual dysfunctions, the frequencies of which have increased from mutational pressure and relaxation of selection in post-Neolithic periods. However, color vision insensitivities also occur in
other vertebrates and appear to be an ecological adaptation for low light levels encountered
during crepuscular activity. I hypothesize a comparable function for human vision deficiencies
and test this by re-examining global frequencies of deficients in relation to photic characteristics
of the habitat. Data presented here show significant positive correlations with length of atmospheric twilight and increased equatorial distance. While support for the twilight hypothesis
remains equivocal, the latitudinal data imply that the high frequencies of color deficiencies in
North European populations represent relatively stable frequencies from Neolithic periods
when these traits were at an advantage. The data and conclusions are inconsistent with the

current practice of using frequencies of these polymorphisms as cultural chronometers.

Among the various classes of inherited color vision deficiencies in humans,
red and green weaknesses in dichromats
and anomalous trichromats are the most
prevalent, affecting approximately 5 per
cent of the human population. These
deficiencies result from molecular
changes at the loci coding for red and
green visual pigments (Nathans et al.,
1986). There is no consensus as to the
origin of these sex-linked polymorphisms or to the evolutionary forces influencing gene frequencies. The major
model that has emerged from the last
century of studies is ‘‘selection relaxation” (Pickford 1958, 1963; Post 1962a,
b, 1971). A low incidence (2 per cent) of
red-green (R-G) deficiencies in hunting
peoples and higher values (8 per cent) in
agricultural and industrial societies led
Post (1962a) to suggest that natural selection was still operating to remove
color vision defectives in hunting populations, while in agricultural or indus
trial societies there has been a relaxation
of selection resulting in an increase in
gene frequency from mutational pressure. Post infers that the proportion of
deutans (green weakness) in Europe has
increased from 1.5 per cent to 6 per cent
since the Neolithic, and Kalmus (1965),
in a review of inherited color deficiencies, notes that this data “provides the
only clear example of a simple inherited
defect, the frequency of which is significantly increased with the advent of civilization.”

Post’s model has provided a popular
framework for interpreting population
differences in color deficiencies (Bha- .
sin, 1967; Dobson et al., 1967; Ray,
1969; Chattopadhyay, 1970; Post, 1971;
Malhotra et al., 1974; Malhotra, 1978;
Sastry, 1974, Mueller and Weiss, 1979;
Salzano, 1980). Yet various aspects of
the model have been criticized (Thoday,
1965; Adam et al., 1966; Adam, 1973;
Halberstein and Crawford, 1974; Murty

and Vijayalaxmi, 1974; Mukherjee et
al., 1979). Ford (1964) suggests that mutation is not a sufficient condition to generate such high frequencies and that this
may be a balanced polymorphism.
Adam (1973) has pointed out that it is
primarily the deuteroanomalous trait
that has increased in frequency, whereas
Post’s model would predict that other
deficiencies should increase in frequency as well. Furthermore, although
the oldest cultures are predicted to have
the highest frequencies of deficients,
this is not the case (Dobson et al., 1967;
Adam 1969).

The basic premise of Post’s model
rests on the assumption that departures
from full trichromatic sensitivity represent a suboptimal condition of the visual
processing system. While this may be
reasonable, there are sufficient data to
justify further scrutiny of this assumption. Recent studies of the visual system
of the Amazonian squirrel monkey
(Saimiri) and the spider monkey (Ateles) also yield evidence for a polymorphism in color vision including variations comparable to the protoanomalous form (weak red deficiency)
in humans (Jacobs, 1981), suggesting e1ther a comparable suboptimal system or
ecological adaptations. Experimental
observations on human vision indicate
that red-green insensitive individuals
can detect relatively smaller differences
in brightness of colors than normals
(Adam 1969), particularily at reduced
light intensity (Iinuma and Handa,
1976; Hurvich, 1981). ‘Color blind” individuals have distinct forms of these
pigments with characteristic absorption
curves (Rushton et al., 1973). Recent
analysis of DNA fragments of the loci
coding for the visual pigments show that
deficients have asymmetric combinations of the major gene fragments as

Social Biology

well as increased numbers of gene copies relatives to normal observers (Nathans et al., 1986), patterns inconsistent
with mutation rate as a source of these
polymorphisms. Deficients occasionally
show enhanced visual acuity in detecting
objects which appear camouflaged to
normal observers (Judd, 1943; Ford,
1964; Thoday, 1965; Roberts, 1967; Roberts and Tanner, 1967), a trait which
could be particularly relevant to early
hunters for detection of predators and
prey. If so, increased fitness among
color insensitive individuals could in
part account for this widespread polymorphism, The major difficulty with this
adaptive interpretation is that, according to Post (1962a), the highest frequencies occur among agricultural and industrial societies rather than among hunting
peoples.

One factor which has not been previously considered in studies of human
color vision polymorphisms is the potential correlations with photic characteristics of the habitat. During a recent biological field trip, I observed that a
member of our group showed exceptional visual acuity at twilight. Subsequent discussion established that he was
either a deuteranope or a severe deuteranomalous trichromat (green insensitive). This prompted the hypothesis that
color visions deficiencies represent evolutionary adaptations among early populations for hunting and gathering activities during the low light intensities
encountered at twilight. This contrasts
with the current model in which anomalies in human color vision are regarded
as dysfunctions and the by-product of
mutational rate.

If the hypothesis is tenable, frequencies of R-G deficients should be highest
in those cultures where activities were
more often conducted at low light levels.

Comparative data on diel activity patterns are not available in ethnographic
studies to examine this prediction. On
the gross assumption that each indigenous culture uses available twilight to a
similar extent, frequencies of R-G deficients should be correlated with the total amount of twilight in the habitat.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Length of civil twilight and total daylight were tabulated from ephemerides
(Anon, 1945) for latitudes 0-60° at 10°
intervals and at 65°. Total hours of twilight per year increases exponentially
with geographic latitude, from 132 h at
the equator to 144h at 30° and to 341 hat
60°. Data are presented as relative
lengths of twilight per day (civil twilight/
civil twilight + daylight). The term
“daylength” is used to designate the
period of daylight plus civil twilight.
Civil twilight is defined as the period between sunset (or sunrise) and the time
when the true position of the sun is 6° beneath the horizon and coincides with the
period when first magnitude stars are
just visible.

I have compiled published frequencies of R-G deficiencies in males from 45
countries (380 populations) and tested
for relationships with both twilight and
latitude. Attempts were made to locate
and include all published data on frequencies for indigenous peoples (those
who have historically resided in one geographical area). Although R-G deficiencies represent at least six classes including protanopes, deuteranopes, protanomalous, and deuteranomalous
classes, much of the literature reports
only two categories, protan (red deficient) and deutan (green deficient) or
combines all phenotypes into a single
category as a general measure of color
Color Vision Deficiencies 3

deficiencies in the population. I have
employed the latter method in the subsequent review. Grouping of protan and
deutan is reasonable as the frequencies
are positively correlated (r = 0.24,
P<0.02).

These data points represent primarily
Eurasia, Africa, and South America. Indigenous people from North America
and the U.S.S.R., which occupy a wide
latitudinal range, have not been surveyed extensively for visual traits.

RESULTS

Relative length of twilight per day
ranges from 6 per cent in equatorial regions to 25 per cent in northern latitudes
(60°N) (Figure 1). Frequency of R-G
insensitive individuals and the amount
of twilight are highly correlated
(r = 0.55, P<0.001) as described by
the power curve y = 1.55 x°® where y is
the frequency of R-G insensitive individuals and x the relative length of twilight per day (Figure 2). A stronger correlation is obtained with latitude (x),
yielding the linear regression y =
2.46 + 0.089x (r = 0.69, P<0.001).
Partitioning for the two major categories of color deficients yields a similar
latitudinal trend for both groups but
with a stronger association for deutans
(protan, r = 0.20, P<0.05; deutan,
r= 0.51, P< 0.001).

Equatorial peoples (+/-— 20°) from
Central and South America, Africa, and
Asia generally have low values (0 per
cent to 4 per cent); those from midlatitudes (20-40°) including North Africa,
the Middle East, India, Tibet, China,
Korea, and Japan have intermediate
values (3 per cent to 6 per cent); and
those from northern latitudes (40-65°),
mainly from Western Europe, have
higher frequencies (6 per cent to 10 per

cent). Highest values occurred in Finland (Kajanoja, 1972) (14.2 per cent) at
63°N. The limited number of data points
from North America show no evidence
of a frequency cline with the northern
Aleuts exhibiting low frequencies.

There were no consistent clines over
small geographical regions such as in the
United Kingdom, India, and Japan
where large segments of the population
have been surveyed. A weak N/S cline
was described (Adam et al., 1970) for
the Bantus of South Africa, where the
frequencies increased from 1.5 per cent
in the northern provinces (22° S) to 4.3
per cent near the southern tip of the continent (33° S).

DISCUSSION

The above data, which provide
equivocal support for the twilight hypothesis, clearly indicate an African and
Eurasian north/south cline in frequencies of color vision polymorphisms
which span different cultures and continents. Thus, at the equator, where twilight is only a minor component to total
daylight, color vision deficiencies are
generally rare, yet in northern regions,
where twilight represents up to 25 per
cent of daylength, color vision frequencies are common. While long summer
daylengths in northern latitudes may
have offset the requirement for crepus

cular activity of early hunters, short winter days could have resulted in substantial use of twilight for hunting activity
and strong selective pressures for the appropriate visual system.

Such correlations between color deficiencies and twilight do not imply causation since latitude is a complex variable associated with daylength, temperature, snow cover, vegetation and
other biota, to name a few. Yet there is
corollary evidence to suggest that photic
regime may be an important factor in
this correlation. Visual pigments in
other vertebrate species show that maximum absorption curves generally correspond to the most common wavelengths of light found in the habitat
while minimum sensitivity correspond
to segments of the spectrum which are
rare or absent (Lythgoe 1979). Atmospheric spectra during twilight show loss
of green wavelengths (McFarland and
Munz 1975) which is the most common
sensitivity loss in humans color vision
deficiencies. In other vertebrate taxa,
trichromatic vision is largely restricted
to diurnally active forms, while reduced
color discrimination, merging into scotopic vision, is prevalent among crepuscular and nocturnal taxa (McFarland
and Munz, 1975; Charles-Dominique,
1977; Lythgoe, 1979; Jacobs, 1981). For
a species such as Homo sapien, which
exhibits substantial behavioral and ecological diversity, it is realistic to assume
that selective forces on visual acuity
would have operated among early
hunters and gatherers in the same direction as that observed in other vertebrates.

Exceptions are evident to the broad
latitudinal trends of color vision deficiency frequencies, particularly among
small indigenous populations. Aleuts
and Eskimos, at high latitudes, have a

Social Biology

low incidence of deficients while among
equatorial peoples, high frequencies are
present in the Jivaro tribe from Ecuador
(7 per cent) (Sunderland and Rosa,
1976), in one village of the Yanomama
tribe in Venezuela (25 per cent)
(Salzano and Neel, 1976) and in the
Niue Polynesians from an island near
Samoa (10 per cent) (Grosvenor, 1970).
Either the twilight model is fundamentally incorrect or these require ad hoc
explanations such as postulating unusual photic characteristics of the habitat.
For example, the extensive use of marine resources by Aleuts and Eskimos
may favor full trichromatic sensitivity.
The dense canopy in Amazonian forests
would greatly restrict understory illumination possibly producing conditions
comparable to twilight where deficients
would have an advantage. Alternatively, since these exceptions involve
small populations and small sample
sizes, stochastic factors may suffice as an
explanation for these anomalies. Critical tests of these concepts require detailed information on subsistence activities, present and historical, and empirical data on sensitivity to movement
and contrast during the transition from
photopic to scotopic vision. Twilight
produces a distinct bimodal spectral irradiance (McFarland and Munz 1975)
which may be integral to assessment of
visual sensitivity of color deficients.

The high frequencies of color deficients in Europe have been previously
regarded as the consequence of mutation rate and the best example in human
populations of an increase in gene frequency following the Neolithic (Neel
and Post, 1963; Kalmus, 1965; Post,
1971). This thesis is based upon the assumption that color deficient frequencies in modern hunters and gatherers are
representative of Neolithic frequencies.
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

Vol. 34, No. 1-2

Post (1971) estimated a frequency of
1.25 per cent for the deuteranomalous
trait in Neolithic Europe based on data
from modern Ugandan Bantus and Papuan New Guineans; both cultures occur
within 10° of the equator. In view of latitudinal correlations described above,
frequencies of color deficients in equatoria] hunters (e.g., Post, 1963, 1971;
Pickford, 1963) do not offer significant
insight into present or past European
frequencies. Comparisons of populations in similar geographical regions,
race, and photic habitats, yet differing in
the extent of hunting and agriculture,
would allow a more meaningful assessment of Post’s model. In northern latitudes, Lapps provide the closest comparison for industrial Europeans. This
indigenous group has a color deficient
frequency of 6.2 per cent, comparable to
the 8.0 per cent predicted on the latitudinal regression. Comparisons of gatherers and nomadics with urban groups in
Asia yield equivocal support for the
model (Kang et al., 1967; Ray, 1969;
Malhotra et al., 1974; Malhotra, 1978;
Sastry, 1974; Naidu et al., 1978); yet
other studies from the same region describe either no relationship or the inverse to that predicted from Post’s
model (Tiwari, 1965; Bansal, 1967; Ray,
1969; Parikh et al., 1970; Murty and Vijayalaxmi, 1974; Mukerjee et al., 1979).
Thus, when standardized for latitude
and ethnicity, there is no compelling evidence to indicate a change in gene frequency among groups recently removed
from hunting and gathering. These data,
in conjunction with the latitudinal cline,
greatly weaken the suggestion of a postNeolithic increase in frequency and
largely exclude the use of color deficient
frequencies as cultural chronometers.
Rather, the available data indicate that
these human genetic polymorphisms

Color Vision Deficiencies 7

may have an extended paleohistory and
that we are observing the general gene
frequencies from earlier periods when
these characters were subject to positive
and negative selective pressures.

What factors could be operating such
that color deficient frequencies rarely
exceed 10 per cent in human populations? If the twilight hypothesis is correct, it seems plausable that some indigenous populations would concentrate
on crepuscular foraging leading to elevated frequencies of deficients. Colorvision anomalies have been investigated
for possible genetic associations with
syndromes such as bipolar manicdepressive illness, alcoholism, and
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (Adam, 1961; Cruz-Coke and
Varela, 1966; Mendlewicz et al., 1972;
Smith, 1972; Gershon et al., 1980). If
present, these factors could contribute
to reduced fitness and reduced frequencies of color deficient alleles. Yet, it follows that when the advantage to color
deficiency was lost, perhaps at the end of
the Neolithic, frequencies would have
declined leading to the conclusion that
deficients were more frequent in Neolithic Europe than at present.

In contrast, there may have been an
ecological context to counter selection
against deficients which would not implicate post-Neolithic frequency
changes. Major color vision anomalies
are sex-linked and expressed primarily
in males with female frequencies representing the square of the male frequencies (Iinuma and Handa, 1976). Thoday
(1965) suggests that such a genetic linkage could develop if the trait was advantageous in males for hunting but disadvantageous in females during food
gathering. Color insensitive females
who are rearing young may be at a particular disadvantage in their inability to

recognize fruit quality or diurnally active threats on the young. Calculation of
equilibrium frequencies for sex-linked
traits (Wright, 1969) for these conditions indicates that a stable polymorphism is readily achieved. For example,
if female deficients had 5 per cent reduction in fitness and male deficients had
< 1.0 per cent advantage, balanced frequencies (> 0.1 per cent and < 10.0 per
cent) would result. If fitness of male deficients is unity at the equator but increases 0.1 per cent for each 10° of latitude, genotype frequency would increase from 1.0 per cent at the equator
to 5.7 per cent at 60°N. If one considers
higher fitness for male deficients, for example, 10 per cent, a5 per cent equilibrium would be maintained only with a 95
per cent reduction in fitness of female
deficients. Such manipulations of selective coefficients are merely of heuristic
value but serve to indicate that even a
modest reduction in fitness of female
color deficients will generate low and
stable frequencies of color deficiencies
in populations. Additional selective parameters, such as frequency dependence, would further relax the range of
fitness values necessary for equilibrium.

In summary, the correlation between
length of twilight and red-green color in
Social Biology

sensitivity, the enhanced visual sensitivity to small differences in color, the presence of unique spectral sensitivities in
color deficients, the increased numbers
of gene copies coding for the pigment
fragments, and the general relationship
between color-vision deficiencies and
crepuscular activities in other vertebrates constitute plausable support for
the twilight hypothesis. It offers an alternative interpretation to Post’s model
for population differences in color deficiencies. Principally, it allows high predictability of frequencies with few inferences of cultural history, mode of
survival, ethnicity, and mutation rate
and offers a mechanism for the evolution of sex-linkage of the traits.
