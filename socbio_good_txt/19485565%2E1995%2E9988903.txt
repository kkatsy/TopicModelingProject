of the Secondary Sex Ratio

ABSTRACT: The timing of insemination relative to ovulation and the frequency of insemination
appear prominently in analyses of variations in human secondary sex ratios. Explanations
invoking these variables are shown to be inadequate. A new synthetic model of sex determination
is proposed in which the sex of offspring is powerfully determined by the state of the cervical
mucus. The cervical state is then shown to be a function of hormonal factors endogenous to the
female in interaction with the effects of previous inseminations.

Recent findings by anthropologists
indicate that in natural fertility populations human secondary sex ratios
may vary significantly with birth order
in a marital union (J. Martin, 1994a),
with marriage and residential form
(Whiting, 1993; Borgerhoff Mulder,
1994), and with marital status (J. Martin, 1994a; Borgerhoff Mulder, 1994).
Two factors have been hypothesized as
linking these behavioral variables with
sex ratios. Whiting (1993, 1994) suggests that the lower sex ratios produced
by polygynously married women are a
function of when they tend to engage in
coitus. In Whiting’s view, female conceptions are most likely when insemination occurs near the time of ovulation. Polygynously married women
(Whiting, 1993, 1994) have more control over their sexuality and are more
likely to engage in coitus when their libidos are strongest, ostensibly near the
time of ovulation. Borgerhoff Mulder
(1994) points out that this effect is
more likely to be significant when cowives are not co-resident and that the
coital rate as well as the time of insemination may affect the sex ratio.

J. Martin (1994a, 1994b) concurs
with the view that coital rate may affect
secondary sex ratios, suggesting that
the significant negative correlation between birth order in a marital union
and sex ratio at birth among the Havasupai has been a function of (1) the
tendency of coital frequency to decline with the number of (surviving)
children and (2) for sex ratios at birth
to correlate positively with coital rate.
J. Martin (1994a, 1994b), like Borgerhoff Mulder (1994), also reports that
women in irregular unions produce
lower sex ratios and attributes this result to their greater control over their
sexuality and to less frequent unprotected coitus. Underwood (1993) and
Brewis (1993) similarly credit the coital
rate with an effect on secondary sex ratios. They find high secondary ratios
among several Micronesian populations, no decline in sex ratios with birth
order, and independent evidence for
high coital rates maintained against
age and marital duration (Brewis and
Underwood, 1994).

The publication of these works
has stimulated a number of exchanges

(James, 1994a, 1994b; J. Martin,
1994a, 19945; Whiting, 1994; Brewis
and Underwood, 1994) concerning the
effects of time of insemination and coital rate on secondary sex ratios. It is
the view of this writer that none of the
existing formulations concerning these
two variables and their relations with
sex ratios are adequate. The present
paper seeks to remedy this situation
through a critique of the existing formulations and the development of a
synthetic model of sex determination.

TIME OF INSEMINATION
AND COITAL RATES

The idea that the sex of offspring is
somehow related to the cycle day of
conception or insemination goes back
at least to Thury who, in 1864, hypothesized that female conceptions occur
early in the cycle, males later (Bernstein, 1988). In the most recent and
developed formulation of this idea,
that of James (1971, 1980, 1983a,
1983b, 1986, 1987, 1994), the cycle day
of the fruitful insemination is a powerful determinant of the sex of the conception. In James’s model, male conceptions are favored by testosterone
and estrogen while gonadotrophins, in
particular luteinizing hormone (LH),
somehow favor female conceptions.
According to James, production of all
three—testosterone, estrogen, and the
gonadotrophins—increase over the
follicular phase, peaking just prior to
ovulation. However, the more powerful effects of the gonadotrophins overcome those of testosterone and estrogen, so that the probability of a female
conception grows as the time of the
fruitful insemination approaches the
time of ovulation. At or after ovula

tion, gonadotrophin levels and the
probability of a female conception
decline.

How or why these hormonal shifts
affect the sex of offspring remains obscure. Moreover, the data on the relations between cycle day of insemination and sex of offspring are scanty and
inconsistent. The data of France et al.,
(1984) seem consistent with James’s
model in that births due to inseminations two or more days before ovulation are predominantly male while
the sex ratio is more balanced among
births resulting from inseminations
around the day of ovulation. While the
France study is very small (n = 33), the
data from Guerrero’s (1974) larger
study are also consistent with James’s
model. In this study (7 = 875), the sex
ratio at birth declines with cycle day of
insemination, reaching a nadir at ovulation, then climbs again. Perez et al.
(1982) report a similar pattern, and
their data also parallel Guerrero’s in
that the births similarly result from failures in the rhythm method of fertility
control. The other data James cites as
consistent with his model, those of
Harlap (1979), present special problems and are discussed below. Not in
accord with the James model are data
from a WHO (1994) study and a study
by Gray (1991) and those reported by
Spira et al. (1993).

In sum, the cycle day of insemination model does not illuminate how
the cited hormonal factors affect sex of
offspring, and many of the data on cycle day and sex ratios are inconsistent
with the model. Further, James’s cycle
day of insemination model was developed to explain Guerrero’s (1974)
data, which include information on artificial as well as natural inseminations.

Guerrero reports that among artificial
inseminations sex ratios increased
rather than declined as cycle day of insemination approached the day of ovulation. This finding is not consistent
with James’s hormonal model. However, James argues that the procedures
involved in artificial insemination
cause anxiety or tension in the women,
thereby depressing the production of
gonadotrophins and resulting in high
rather than low sex ratios when conceptions are due to inseminations near
the time of ovulation. The problem in
this argument is that in the Guerrero
data the sex ratio among conceptions
due to early (=3 days before ovulation) insemination is about 39 per cent
male, 71 per cent female. If female
births are produced by high levels of
maternal gonadotrophins, these data
suggest that the procedures involved
in artificial insemination increase the
production of gonadotrophins when
they occur before ovulation and suppress their production when the procedures are performed at the time of ovulation. These arguments stretch one’s
credulity.

‘A further shortcoming of the
timing-of-insemination hypothesis is
that it cannot account for the welldocumented propensity for secondary
sex ratios to decline with birth order in
a marital union (Erickson, 1976; Chahnazarian, 1988; J. Martin, 1994a). To
account for a decline in secondary sex
ratios as birth order increases with
James’s timing-of-insemination model
requires that there be some mechanism
which shifts the time of insemination
with birth order. Early on, James
(1971) argued that more frequent coitus raises the probability of insemination early in the fertile period. As early

Martin

 

Social Biology

fruitful inseminations putatively result
in higher sex ratios, more frequent
coitus early in a marriage would raise
sex ratios among early births while the
declining coital rates associated with
subsequent births would lead sex ratios
to decline thereafter.

More recently, James (1994a,
1994b) has shifted his position, citing
data from a contracepting, behaviorally heterogenous, national population
(U. K.) in which sex ratios change little
with birth order, to argue that in no
populations is there a decline of any
significance. As has been pointed out
(Martin, 1994a), one can guarantee
this claim by aggregating subpopulations which differ in their reproductive
behaviors so that their differences cancel each other. However, examination
of behaviorally uniform natural fertility populations reveals large variations
in sex ratios with birth order (J. Martin, 1994a). Further, James (1994a)
continues to maintain that a higher
coital rate raises the probability of insemination early in the fertile period
and that this will raise (slightly) the sex
ratio at birth. While it is true that a
higher coital rate raises the probability
of insemination early in the fertile period, it also raises (equally) the probability of insemination later in the
fertile period. Hence, unless early inseminations can alter the conditions
facing later inseminations, an issue addressed below, coital rates cannot alter
the sex ratio at birth in the manner
envisioned by James.

The idea that coital rates may affect
the secondary sex ratio in noncontracepting populations has been advanced
by others (Brewis, 1993; Underhill,
1994; J. Martin, 1994a). However, it
remains unclear how coital rates could

Vol. 42, No. 3-4

lead secondary sex ratios to vary with
time of insemination. One argument,
cited by J. Martin (1994a, 19945), is
that Y-spermatozoa migrate more rapidly through cervical mucus and because of this, inseminations immediately before, at, and after ovulation
favor male conceptions. Earlier inseminations allow slower X-bearing spermatozoa to reach a site of fertilization
before ovulation. This lowers the Y/X
ratio at those sites and that ratio may
be lowered further if the greater motility of Y-bearing spermatozoa is purchased with a shorter effective life
span. Under these conditions more frequent inseminations infuse the uterus
with fresh supplies of the more motile
Y-bearing spermatozoa, raising the ratio of Y to X spermatozoa.

The difficulties with this scenario include the following: (1) There is no
evidence that Y-bearing spermatozoa
have lower longevity in the uterus. (2)
This model predicts that sex ratios will
rise at and after ovulation, which fits
Guerrero’s (1974) data on artificial insemination but not the data on natural
inseminations. In all the other, natural
insemination studies, sex ratios either
decline as the time of insemination approaches ovulation (Guerrero, 1974;
Perez et al., 1982; France et al., 1984)
or show no change with time of insemination (WHO, 1984; Harlap, 1979;
Gray, 1991; Spira et al., 1993).

This unsatisfactory state of affairs
motivates the following discussion of
the endocrinology of the female cycle
and its interrelation with coital rates
and sperm migration. Following from
the discussion is the proposition that
the sex of offspring is powerfully determined by the interaction of three
variables: (1) the endogenous state of

229

the cervical mucus, (2) coital rate and
its effects on the cervical mucus, and
(3) the implications of (1) and (2) for
sperm migration. It is then shown that
the data all are consistent with this
proposition.

HORMONES, COITAL PATTERNS
AND SEX RATIOS

Cervical mucus consists of a hydrogel of mucin suspended in a plasma
(Schumacher, 1973). Through much of
the menstrual cycle the mucin forms a
dense, three-dimensional network of
macromolecular threads with extensive
cross-linking between them. Spaces
between the macromolecules (the
mesh size) are between 0.1 and 0.5 pm
(Odeblad, 1973). Human sperm heads
are on average 2.5 um in width and 1.5
um in thickness (Moghissi, 1973) and
as a result when the mucus is in this
state it forms an effective barrier to
sperm penetration. However, early in
the follicular phase low levels of the gonadotrophins, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone
(LH), are secreted into the bloodstream by the pituitary. Together these
stimulate a follicle which eventually
ripens and bursts, releasing an ovum
and transforming into a corpus luteum.
While still developing, the follicle converts cholesterol into androgens, including testosterone, and then manufactures estradiol, an estrogen, from
testosterone (Wood, 1994). The estradiol produced by the developing follicle stimulates further follicular development leading to a surge in the
production of estradiol beginning some
six or so days before ovulation. In addition to stimulating further follicular
growth, the growing level of estradiol

230

causes an increase in the production of
cervical mucus, a change in its molecular structure and an increase in its water content (Moghissi, 1973; Wood,
1994). The mucus becomes thin and
watery while the molecules making up
the mucin take on a more linear structure, forming micelles 0.5-5.0 um
apart with a diameter of 0.5 um and
with few cross-links between them. As
the flow of mucus from the cervical
crypts increases, it aligns these micelles
parallel to the long axis of the cervix
and thereby creates passageways from
the vagina to the crypts and the uterus.
As these passageways increase in number and size, first the more progressively motile, then larger and less motile spermatozoa swim through the
mucus filter to reach the uterus directly, or indirectly, after reaching a
crypt (Odeblad, 1973; Moghissi, 1973;
Wood, 1994).

In lower concentrations and in combinations with other hormones, estradiol indirectly inhibits the production
of LH and FSH. But as estradiol production builds, a point is reached at
which it triggers a surge in the production of these gonadotrophins. They in
turn stimulate ovulation and the release of the corpus luteum. The corpus
luteum then begins to produce progesterone which inhibits the production of
cervical mucus and alters its structure.
Over the day or so right after ovulation, the mucus again thickens, becoming again an impenetrable barrier to
spermatozoa (Wood, 1994). However,
even in the late follicular phase and
the day or so after ovulation when
spermatozoa can penetrate the cervical
barrier, few manage to complete the
journey.

Social Biology

On average there are 250-300 million spermatozoa in the ejaculate of a
normal human male. Many, perhaps 35
per cent, of the spermatozoa inseminated into a vagina never even enter
the cervix, instead flowing back out of
the vagina moments after insemination
(Baker and Bellis, 1993). Millions
more die in the hostile environment of
that organ. Of those which begin the
journey through the cervix on average
only 2,000 or so successfully swim into
the uterus. Of these about 200 and as
few as 40-50 eventually reach a site of
fertilization. Hence, if even half of the
250 million spermatozoa in the average
ejaculation begin the journey through
the cervix and but 2,000 reach the
uterus, the implication is that more
than one-hundred million become
stranded and die in the cervix. Over
time the dead spermatozoa, maternally
generated leucocytes, and other detritus of an insemination are flushed from
the cervix by the production of fresh
cervical mucus and its flow toward the
vagina. However, Baker and Bellis
(1993) report that such detritus may
take up to eight days to clear from the
cervix. In consequence, if insemination
occurs more than about once a week,
that is, if there are subsequent inseminations before the detritus of previous
acts is cleared from the cervix, the effects of each coital act will be additive.
More frequent coitus and increasing
coital rates will thus increasingly clutter up the passageways through the
cervix. Less frequent coitus and declining coital rates reduce this effect.

This effect is significant because
studies indicate that when migrating
spermatozoa encounter such debris,
they stop or alter their course (Mog

Vol. 42, No. 3-4

hissi, 1973). Hence, low and declining
coital rates reduce this exogenously derived barrier to sperm penetration;
higher and rising coital rates increase
impedance in subsequent inseminations. Coital rates may thus reinforce
or dampen the effects of the hormonally induced changes in cervical mucus.
If the coital rate declines over the follicular phase, as for instance is likely
when a woman uses the rhythm
method to control her fertility, blockages due to debris from previous coital
acts will decline and the hormonally induced increase in the penetrability of
her mucus as she approaches ovulation
will be more fully realized. Similarly, if
coitus is simply rare, once a week or
less, sperm penetrability will increase
as ovulation is approached. On the
other hand, if the coital rate is higher,
sperm penetrability will be reduced.
As the coital rate is increased, the decrease in sperm penetration will be accentuated because of the additive effect. Hence, while low and declining
coital rates allow and even reinforce
endogenous increases in sperm penetrability over the follicular phase,
higher and increasing coital rates
should flatten or even reverse that
trend.

The patterning of sperm penetrability of the cervical mucus is of importance for sex determination because
there is a growing body of evidence
that X and Y spermatozoa differ in
their ability to penetrate mucus. The
reason for this difference may be that
Y spermatozoa swim more vigorously
or more often and/or, because they are
smaller (Shettles, 1976; Glass, 1977;
Cui and Mathews, 1993), they have
less drag in a plasma medium (Pyrsak,

Determinants of Sex Ratio

231

1994) and can more readily negotiate
smaller and cluttered passageways.
The evidence that Y spermatozoa
move through mucus more readily
comes from a number of sources. Pyrsak (1994) reports that when spermatozoa are layered over an albumin density gradient column, Y spermatozoa
reach the bottom or distal end of the
column more rapidly than do X-bearing spermatozoa. These findings confirm the earlier work of Ericsson and
others (Ericsson et al., 1973; Beernink
et al., 1993; Ericsson, 1994) and answer some of the criticisms of the earlier work. The earlier work has been
criticized on the grounds that Ericsson’s method of discerning Y-bearing
spermatozoa, the fluorochrome quinacrine staining technique, is inaccurate
and that a number of other researchers
have not been able to produce similar
results (R. Martin, 1994). However,
in the research reported by Pyrsak
(1994), X and Y spermatozoa are distinguished using a more accurate DNA
hybridization technique. Further, Pyrsak (1994) points out that when less
than 10 per cent of the spermatozoa in
initial populations are recovered, the
Y/X ratios among the recovered spermatozoa are much higher than the Y/X
ratio in the initial population (66-71
per cent versus 50 per cent male).
However, when more than 10 per cent
are recovered, the Y/X ratio is closer
to that in the original population. The
studies which failed to separate X and
Y spermatozoa recovered higher percentages than those cited, and their
results were to be expected. Ericsson
(1994) similarly emphasizes the importance of recovering a very small proportion of the migrating spermatozoa;
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

232

he reports up to 85 per cent Y spermatozoa when no more than 3 per cent of
the original spermatozoa are recovered. He also cites results from 65 clinics which use this procedure to enrich
sperm for the purposes of sex predetermination. Those clinics report that
70 per cent of 1,034 births were males
(Ericsson, 1994; Beernink et al., 1993).
Ericsson believes that these results are
a function of greater progressive motility among Y spermatozoa (Ericsson
et al., 1993). This view is reinforced by
the findings of Rohde et al. (1972). In
their study Y spermatozoa in seven
separate in vivo experiments migrated
more rapidly through cervical mucus
than did X spermatozoa. Broer et al.
(1976) in an in vitro post-coital study
found that while the ejaculates of the
husbands of the subjects in the study
contained 47 per cent Y spermatozoa,
the percentage Y among spermatozoa
in the upper cervix and the uterus
was 57. Taken with the other studies,
these findings indicate that Y spermatozoa migrate more readily through a
number of media, including cervical
mucus. They also suggest that the Y/X
ratio among spermatozoa which pass
through a mucus filter is a function
of the severity of the filtration. As filtration increases and a smaller proportion of the original population passes
through the filter, the Y percentage
grows.

In extension of this line of reasoning, we might hypothesize that because
cervical mucus becomes more penetrable over the follicular phase, then
thickens again with ovulation and the
emergence of the corpus luteum, when
there is but one insemination per cycle
the ratio of Y/X spermatozoa among
those which reach the uterus should

Social Biology

decline as insemination approaches the
time of ovulation, then rise again after
ovulation and the release of the corpus
luteum. This pattern should hold when
coital rates are very low (<1 per
week) and/or when they decline over
the follicular phase. However, if coital
rates are higher, and especially if they
increase as the time of ovulation approaches, the build up of detritus from
previous inseminations should undermine this trend.

The work of Broer et al. (1976) supports this view. While these researchers found the Y/X ratio among spermatozoa reaching the uterus to be
significantly higher than it was in the
husbands’ ejaculates, they did not find
that sperm penetration or the Y/X ratio varied with the state of the cervical
mucus. This state was assessed through
an assay of mucus spinnbarkeit, a measure of the presence of more of the
longer macromolecular chains and the
greater development of micelles and
more and larger passageways through
the mucus. They suggest that sperm
penetration may be more a function of
the (unvarying) properties of seminal
and cervical plasmas and of the boundary between them than of the fibrosity
of the cervical mucus. This surmise is
inconsistent with all the research on
mucus sperm penetrability (Moghissi,
1973; Wood, 1994). A more likely reason for this finding stems from the fact
that the individuals in their study were
patients participating in a fertility program. Presumably, they were trying to
conceive and had engaged in other coital acts shortly before those which
provided the data. The detritus from
the previous acts would undermine the
effects of improved spinnbarkeit on
sperm penetration. The detritus should
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

Vol. 42, No. 3-4

also have muted any effect of improved
mucus fibrosity on the Y/X ratio
among spermatozoa reaching the upper cervix. The findings supported this
hypothesis. While there was slight decrease in the Y/X ratio with improved
spinnbarkeit, the difference was not
statistically significant.

Data from studies of the relations
between sex ratios at birth and cycle
day of insemination also are consistent
with the proposition that Y/X ratios
are functions of the interaction of hormonally induced changes in cervical
mucus, differences in the motilities of
X and Y spermatozoa, and the patterning of coitus in the follicular phase.
Guerrero’s (1974) data are the most often cited in discussions of the issue of
cycle day of insemination and its implications for sex of offspring. The majority of the 875 naturally inseminated
women in that study were used the
rhythm method to avoid pregnancy.
Women using the rhythm method reduce their coital rate to zero as they
approach what they estimate to be the
time of ovulation, and then begin again
after they believe they are again safe.
Obviously, these subjects calculated
badly or were undone by irregular ovulation, but nevertheless we should presume that their coital rates were dropping as they approached their actual as
well as their estimated times of ovulation. Under these conditions we should
expect what Guerrero found, that the
sex ratio among births declined as the
time of insemination approached ovulation. We should also expect that,
because the mucus thickens after ovulation and the release of the corpus luteum, and because an ovum is waiting
to reward greater sperm speed, sex ratios among births resulting from post
Determinants of Sex Ratio

233

ovulation inseminations should rise.
This hypothesis is also supported by
the Guerrero data. This expectation,
that the patterning of sex ratios among
births resulting from rhythm failures
should be lowest around ovulation, is
also met in the smaller study of Perez
et al. (1982). In the WHO (1984) study
of the effectiveness of the rhythm
method, the same pattern is also evident, although not statistically significant. In the study by France et al.
(1984) couples engaged in coitus once
in each cycle and the resultant patterning of the sex of offspring was also
consistent with expectations.

Data from the GEFCO study (Spira
et al., 1993) come from individuals
who were trying to conceive. Presumably, those individuals were using the
temperature curve charts they shared
with the investigators to time their coital acts, increasing them as they approached the expected shift in basal
body temperature. With this pattern
we should expect detritus to build as
ovulation approaches and to undermine the effects of thinning cervical
mucus. Under these conditions there
should be no trend in Y/X ratios or, by
extension, in sex ratios at birth, and
that is what was found. Gray’s (1991)
study similarly shows no relation between cycle day of insemination and
sex ratios but his report does not provide information about coital patterns.

Harlap’s (1979) analysis is based
on 3,658 births to Orthodox Jewish
women who ostensibly refrain from
coitus during menstruation and then
for seven or more clean days. Normally
a ritual bath is taken on the seventh
night and intercourse follows. Harlap’s
protocol is to treat conception as occurring on the day on which intercourse is
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

resumed; hence her title, ““Gender of
Infants Conceived on Different Days
of the Menstrual Cycle.” Presumably it
is for this reason that she excludes from
her analysis 3,478 additional births to
women who resumed intercourse three
or more days before the estimated time
of ovulation. Inexplicably, however,
she includes in her analysis 2,555 births
to women who resumed intercourse a
day or two before ovulation. Since
none of these women could have conceived before ovulation, she should
have discarded all of these data if her
focus were truly on the effects of the
day of conception on the sex of offspring. If the focus were on the cycle
day of insemination, as it is here and as
most readers have understood her paper, she should have included the additional 3,478 births in her analysis.
When we do include these births and
another 430 deleted births which resulted from post-ovulatory inseminations and analyze the sex of offspring
for inseminations occurring on days
=—3, -2,-1,0, +1, +2, and +3, the
correlation between cycle day of insemination and sex of offspring disappears (X* = 15.92; 13df; p = 0.25, not
significant).

There are other problems in Harlap’s analysis which are important
here. Of greatest significance is the
method of determining the day of insemination relative to ovulation. The
day of ovulation is treated as the expected date of the onset of menstruation minus 14 days. In other words, the
luteal phase is treated as a constant 14
days. The expected date of the onset of
menstruation is not defined explicitly,
but the procedures make it clear that is
a function of the length of the cycle.
Thus, the day of ovulation is always the

Martin

Social Biology

length of the cycle minus 14 days. If the
cycle is 28 days in length, ovulation occurs on day 14. If the cycle is 32 days in
length, ovulation occurs on day 18; if
the cycle lasts but 26 days, ovulation
occurs on day 12. The length of the
cycle was determined by asking the
women on the day after giving birth
what the lengths of their three previous
cycles were, that is, how long were
their cycles 10-12 months previous.
Where there was variance in a woman’s response on cycle length, the midpoint of the range was used as the
length of her (fruitful) cycle.

Obviously, there is a good deal of
room for error in this method. There is
more room for error in the method of
determining the day of responsible insemination which was assumed to occur on the first day of intercourse. That
day is presumed to have occurred normally on the day after five days of
bleeding plus seven “‘clean”’ days and a
ritual bath, or 13 days into the cycle.
Under these conditions and with a 28
day cycle, the first and therefore fruitful intercourse would occur on day 13,
one day before ovulation. With a 30
day cycle, fruitful insemination would
still occur on day 13, but ovulation
would be two days later (on day 16) so
that fruitful insemination would occur
three days before ovulation. Short cycles, like longer periods of abstinence,
would move the day of insemination up
to and past the day of ovulation.

Clearly, this method of determining
the day of fruitful intercourse is also
subject to error. Most notably, the assumptions that intercourse does not
occur before the ritual bath and that
the first coital act is the responsible act
may be wrong. The data indicate that
they are wrong.

When we examine the distribution
of births (Table 1) by the presumed
days of fruitful insemination, we see
that 5,151 out of 7,566 (68 per cent)
presumed days occurred two or more
days before the estimated time of ovulation. Given Harlap’s methods, this
finding means that in 68 per cent of the
cases either the cycle length was 29 or
more days or that periods lasted 4 days
or less. As 3,478 births derive from acts
3 or more days in advance of ovulation,
the implication is that 46 per cent of all
cycles were 30 or more days in length
or that 46 per cent of the periods lasted
3 days or less. In contrast, only 32 per
cent of the cycles were 28 days or less.

This distribution is odd, hardly consistent with a “normal” or populationmean 28 day cycle and a 5 day period.
The probable explanation for this skew
is that while menstruation may generally have lasted five days and ritual
baths generally were taken after seven
clean days, intercourse often occurred
before the bath and the cycles were in
actuality shorter. But, if the preceding
is the case, then Harlap’s estimation of
the timing of the earliest coital acts
must often be in error. If the inseminations misclassified as early are random relative to the sex of the resultant
birth, their proper reclassification
would affect the sex ratios associated
with later inseminations. Examination
of Table 1 makes this point clear.
Births classified as resulting from inseminations three or more days before
ovulation are 52.8 per cent male. If
those births erroneously included in
that group accurately sample it (i.e.,
are 52.8 per cent male) and could be
distributed over the appropriate later
days, they would lower the proportion
male on Day —2 (now 53.3 per cent

Determinants of Sex Ratio

235

male) and raise the proportion male
(51.3) on Days —1 and 0. They would,
in short, smooth the distribution.

This distribution, in which sex of
offspring does not vary with day of
fruitful insemination, should arise
where women resume coitus after menstruation and then engage in it fairly
frequently. As the mucus begins to
thin, Y spermatozoa enjoy some advantage. Because subsequent hormonally induced thinning of the mucus
would be countered by the effects of
the debris from the earlier inseminations, the Y advantage in subsequent
inseminations should not materially
decline. Table 1 which groups the
Guerrero data and the Harlap data
into equivalent intervals illustrates the
differences resulting from the two coital patterns.

The data in Table 1 are consistent
with the following propositions. Hormonally induced decreases in the density of cervical mucus and low and declining coital rates over the follicular
phase result in the sex ratios among
offspring declining as the cycle day of
fruitful insemination approaches ovulation. The nadir is reached on the
days of the mucus peak. After ovulation, thickening mucus and the presence of the ovum again reward the
greater progressive motility of Y spermatozoa. However, when coital rates
are high or are rising so that the debris
from previous coital acts builds up in
the cervix as ovulation is approached,
the effects of hormonally induced thinning of the mucus are undermined as
are any connections between day of insemination and sex of offspring.

The dynamic factor in all of the
above is coital rate. Consideration of
the above also supports the idea that

coital rate should strongly affect overall sex ratios at birth. Very low, constant rates should produce the lowest
sex ratios, lower than rates which decline to ovulation then rise because the
latter regime raises the proportions of
early and late conceptions. High and
rising coital rates should produce the
highest sex ratios because high coital
rates raise the sex ratio associated with
each day in the fertile period while rising rates raise the sex ratio on the days
near and at ovulation.

When insemination bypasses the
cervical filter, as in intrauterine artificial insemination, much of the above
if obviated. In natural inseminations
the cervical filter allows only the most
progressively motile spermatozoa to
reach the uterus but raises the Y/X ratio among those spermatozoa in doing
so. When the cervical filter is bypassed
and ejaculate is delivered to the uterus
through artificial insemination, the
Y/X ratio among the spermatozoa in
the uterus will be equal to the ratio in
the ejaculate but there will be significant differences in their progressive
motilities with the most motile spermatozoa including a high proportion of Y
spermatozoa. While the motions of the
cilia and the uterus aide sperm trans

port, sperm progressive motility is still
important in the uterus. When insemination occurs well before ovulation,
allowing the less progressively motile
spermatozoa to reach the sites of
fertilization before ovulation, greater
progressive motility brings little reward. But when artificial insemination
occurs at or after ovulation the advantages of speed may be realized. We
should then expect the sex ratio among
births which result from artificial insemination to be highest when insemination occurs at or after the time of
ovulation. Guerrero’s data on 443 artificially inseminated births show this
pattern. The percentage male among
306 births from inseminations on
ovulation day and thereafter is 58.5.
Among the 137 births which resulted
from earlier inseminations the percentage is 44.5 (Guerrero, 1974, p. 1057).

CONCLUSIONS

It is well known that when insemination is natural, the state of the cervical mucus is a powerful determinant
of the probability of conception. The
data and relationships discussed here
suggest that the state of the mucus is
also a powerful determinant of the sex
at conception and that the mucus state
is a function of hormonal factors and
the effects of previous inseminations.
Generally, increased production of
the estrogen estradiol increases the
penetrability of mucus over the six or
so days before ovulation. After ovulation, increased production of progesterone by the corpus luteum quickly
reverses this trend. Previous inseminations also reduce the penetrability of
the mucus by cluttering the passageways through it with up to several hun

dred million stranded sex cells, maternally generated leucocytes, and other
debris. Hence, while infrequent coitus
and declining coital rates in the late
follicular phase result in an increase
in mucus penetrability up to ovulation,
then a decrease after ovulation, more
frequent coitus and a rising coital rate
may counteract any hormonally induced improvement in the mucus. Because Y-bearing spermatozoa are advantaged by greater cervical filtration,
the sex ratio at conception therefore
correlates positively with coital rate
and will not vary with time of fruitful
insemination when coital rates are
high. It is only when coital rates are declining or coitus occurs once every
seven or eight days that the sex ratio at
conception (and birth) will vary with
the time of fruitful insemination.

The interaction of coital rate and female hormonal levels thus powerfully
determines the state of the cervical mucus. The mucus state is in turn a major
proximate determinant of the sex ratio
at conception. Other proximate determinants of the sex ratio at conception
are the cited differences in the sizes
and motilities of X and Y spermatozoa
and, not discussed here, the proportions of X and Y spermatozoa in the
inseminate. Theoretically, we might

expect each type to make up 50 per
cent of the spermatozoa in the inseminate. Empirically, however, the mean
proportions Y are shown to be closer
to 46-47 per cent in most studies, and
there is considerable individual variation around the means. After conception there is some evidence that the sex
ratio at birth may also be affected by
variation in the rates of early spontaneous abortions among male and female fetuses (Wood, 1994).

However, it is the state of the cervical mucus and its dependence on maternal hormones and coital rate which
clarify why sex ratios at birth vary with
the time of fruitful insemination in
cases of rhythm failure (Guerrero,
1974; Perez et al., 1982; WHO, 1984)
and when coitus is simply rare (France
et al., 1984), while there is no such relation when coital rates are high or rising (Harlap, 1979; Spira et al., 1983).
And because the mucus state is sensitive to coital rate, the cited conclusions
also clarify why sex ratios correlate
negatively with the birth order or the
number of (surviving) children and
why secondary sex ratios tend to be
lower among the offspring of polygynously married women than they are
among monogamists (Whiting, 1993;
Borgerhoff Mulder, 1994).
