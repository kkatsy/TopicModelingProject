ABSTRACT: The conventional approach to the measurement of mortality conceptualizes mortality
as a function of the age distribution of deaths. Because at contemporary mortality levels the great
bulk of deaths are concentrated at the high ages, measures based on deaths are insensitive to
mortality changes over most of the life span. An alternative is to conceptualize mortality as a
function of the age distribution of death rates. When this is done, large differentials in mortality
by sex and by race emerge from the data, calling attention to serious social issues that have been

masked by conventional mortality indicators.

One of the most significant developments of the past century has been the
widespread and large-scale reduction in
human mortality. It grew out of advances
in the standard of living brought about by
industrialization and modernization, and
during the past thirty years has been accelerated in many countries by modern
public health techniques. The extensive
death records of many nations, some going
back a century or more, provide a wealth
of information about the fall in mortality.
These records, by sex, age, cause-ofdeath, and other characteristics, have accordingly been the subject of numerous
investigations. Nonetheless, the conventional approach to the measurement of
mortality trends and differentials is predicated on a conceptualization of mortality
whose nature has not been fully appreciated.

CONCEPTUALIZING MORTALITY: THE
CONVENTIONAL APPROACH

The primary analytical tool for the
study of mortality is the life table, which
provides the basic measure of survivorship—the expectation of life. The expectation of life is the average number of future

years that will be lived under a given
schedule of mortality rates. The expectation of life at birth (or the average age at
death) is generally used as an index for
comparing life tables and hence for comparing schedules of mortality.

The life table also provides an average
mortality rate. The life table death rate, or
the crude death rate of the life table, is the
number of deaths occurring in the life
table in one year divided by the life table
population. It can be shown mathematically that the life table death rate is the
reciprocal of the expectation of life at birth
(for an extensive discussion of the life table, see Shyrock and Siegel, 1973, Chap.
15).

The life table death rate is conceptually
similar to the two widely used indexes of
mortality that do not derive from the life
table. The simplest of the two is the crude
death rate, the number of deaths in a population divided by the number of persons
in that population. The name “crude” is
well-deserved, because the crude death
rate of a population is greatly influenced
by the population’s age composition. Two
populations with the same death rates at
every age but with different age composi

tions may have quite different crude death
rates.

To deal with the problem of differing
age compositions, standardized death
rates are frequently employed as indexes
of mortality. A directly standardized death
rate, DS, is of the form

DS = , (1)
zz” x

where, P,* is the population in some specified standard population between the ages
of x and x +n, and,M,, the age-specific
death rate, is equal to the observed number of deaths to persons aged x tox +n
divided by the observed population aged x
tox +n. In other words, the standardized
death rate is the crude death rate that
would be found in the standard population
if the standard population experienced the
observed age-specific death rates. The life
table death rate is a special type of standardized death rate where the “standard”
population is the population of the life table.

The three indexes mentioned above, the
crude death rate, the standardized death
rate, and the life table death rate are all
examples of what Kitagawa (1964) calls
“ageregative” indexes. This type of index
aggregates the number of deaths in the
numerator and the number of persons in
the denominator and then takes their ratio. Because the first step is to aggregate
observed (or weighted) numbers of deaths,
aggregative indexes represent mortality as
a function of the age distribution of
deaths. For example, the life table death
rate summarizes mortality as the reciprocal of the mean of the age distribution of
life table deaths.

In general, studies of mortality trends
and patterns have been based on one or
more aggregative indexes, particularly the
expectation of life at birth (e.g., see Preston et al., 1973; United Nations, 1973, p.

Social Biology

108ff; Arriaga and Davis, 1969; United
Nations, 1963; Stolnitz, 1955; and Dublin
et al., 1949). This has been the case even
though drawbacks and limitations of such
indexes have been pointed out by investigators. Yerushalmy (1951) demonstrated
that, in practice, aggregative indexes give
disproportionately heavy weight to the
higher ages. Hermalin (1966) showed that
the implications of changes in the expectation of life varied with the level of life
expectancy. Spiegelman and Marks (1966)
emphasized the importance of choosing an
“appropriate” standard population, and
Kitagawa (1966) and Schoen (1970)
showed that mortality differentials can
vary significantly when measured by different aggregative indexes. Still, the full
implications of basing mortality analysis
on an adjusted age distribution of deaths
have not been made clear.

THE CHANGING AGE DISTRIBUTION OF DEATHS

To examine the consequences of conceptualizing mortality in terms of the age distribution of deaths, let us consider how
that distribution changes as the level of
mortality falls. The study by Coale and
Demeny (1966) on Regional Model Life
Tables is most relevant here as it grew out
of an in-depth investigation of mortality
patterns by level of mortality. Coale
and Demeny found that four distinctive
mortality “families’—labeled “North,”
“South,” “East,” and “West” because they
were somewhat related to patterns found
in those areas of Europe—characterized
all known life tables. In particular, they
found that the characteristic pattern of
mortality persisted even when the level of
mortality changed.

The “West” family of model life tables,
which is based largely on the experience of
Western Europe and overseas European
populations (including the United States),
can illustrate the effects of changes in the
level of mortality on the age distribution of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

Vol. 23, No. 3

deaths (see Table 1). As the expectation of
life at birth rose from 20 to 75, the proportion of life table deaths to persons under
age 5 fell from 0.53 to 0.02, while the
proportion of life table deaths to persons
over 65 rose from 0.08 to 0.83. In model
life table populations with an expectation
of life at birth (or average age at death) of
less than 35 years, most people die before
attaining their expectation of life. With the
wholesale shift of deaths from the lowest
ages to the highest, most persons in life
table populations with a life expectancy of
more than 35 years live longer than their
expectation of life.

The nature of the age distribution of
deaths (the d function) can be examined in
terms of its variance as well as its mean.
The “variance of life” can readily be expressed in terms of life table functions as

Var(d) = e(2A — e), (2)

where A is the average age of those in the
life table population and e is the expectation of life at birth. Table 1 shows that the

at an accelerating rate as deaths become
increasingly concentrated at the high ages
(cf. Ryder, 1975).

The historical decline in mortality in the
West affected the different ages, sexes,
and causes of death to varying degrees.
Advances were made against infectious
and parasitic diseases, not against the degenerative diseases. Females benefited
more than males. Mortality below age 50
fell much more than mortality after age
50. It now appears that the mortality decline in the West has about run its course.
Death rates have actually begun to rise
somewhat in certain areas (cf. Klebba,
1971; Schoen and Collins, 1973). Still, few
people die before the age of 50. The elimination of all deaths from infectious and
parasitic diseases would produce only a
small increase in longevity. At the same
time, death rates remain high at ages over
65; very few persons survive to age 100.

The profound changes in the age distribution of deaths with changes in the
level of mortality suggest that the interpre

rates of a few older age groups. When
mortality levels were still high, appreciable changes in life expectancy could and
did result from reductions in death rates at
the younger ages. With mortality at contemporary Western levels, this is no longer
true. Consider the mortality observed
among Netherlands females in 1964. Some
95 per cent of those born will survive to
age 50. The elimination of all deaths before the age of 50 would only increase the
expectation of life (76.4 years) by 3 years.
A female aged 85, however, could only
expect to live another 5.3 years. This
compression of the great bulk of deaths
into a narrow range of ages means that the
expectation of life at birth has become increasingly insensitive to changes in
mortality at many ages. The magnitude of
this development can be assessed when
mortality improvement as measured by
the expectation of life at birth is compared
with mortality improvement as measured
by a different kind of index.

CONCEPTUALIZING MORTALITY: AN
ALTERNATIVE APPROACH

An alternative type of mortality index,
which Kitagawa (1964) calls an “average
of relatives” index, affords a different conceptualization. An average of relatives
index compares two populations by taking
the ratio of corresponding terms in their
schedules of age-specific death rates and
then averaging those ratios. Because the
first step is to take the ratio of death rates,
an average of relatives index summarizes
mortality as a function of the age pattern
of death rates.

The Coale-Demeny-study (1966) reveals
a striking consistency in the age pattern of
death rates. Figure 1 shows that regardless
of mortality level, the characteristic “J”
pattern of the age curve of death rates
persists. This stability enhances the value
of the age distribution of death rates as a

Schoen

basis for measuring improvements in mortality.

As is the case with aggregate indexes, a
number of different average of relatives
indexes can be constructed. The exponential character of much of the age curve of
death rates (i.e., the fact that it approximates a straight line over the large part of
its range when the vertical axis is
logarithmic) suggests a geometric mean.
Following Schoen (1970), the present
paper will therefore use del (also written
V), the geometric mean of the age-specific
death rates, as an average of relatives
index of mortality. Defined mathematically,

del = @ »M,)'19

exp S & In ,Mz) (3)

with death rates from the standard 19 age
groups 0, 1-4, 5~9,... , 80-84, and 85+.

When mortality is conceptualized as a
function of the age curve of death rates
(and summarized by del) rather than as a
function of the age curve of deaths using
the life table death rate, a different pattern
of mortality change is seen in the data.
Table 2 shows how the two measures vary
as life expectancy goes from 20 to 75 years
in the Coale-Demeny model “West” life
table populations. When ¢ is 45 or less, the
two measures are nearly identical. As the
expectation of life increases beyond 45 and
the variance of life decreases, the geometric mean death rate becomes an eversmaller fraction of the life table death rate.
Consequently, as life expectancy increases
beyond 50 years, del reflects larger improvements in mortality than does the life
table death rate. For example, when e increases from 60 to 70 years, the life table
death rate falls 14 per cent, while the
geometric mean death rate falls 50 per
cent.

60 to 70 years. Hence, an increase in e
from 60 to 70 years required 3.5 times as
much change in the age distribution of
death rates as a ten-year increase in e at
low life expectancies. In the same fashion,
an increase in e from 70 to 75 years involved 6.25 times as much change in del as
in the life table death rate, or 6.25 times
the amount of change in the age distribution of death rates than was required to
raise ¢ five years at life expectancies below
45. Substantially more change in the age
distribution of death rates was necessary
to raise e at high levels of e because at
those levels the observed changes in death
rates had much less impact on the age
distribution of deaths and thus had a
greatly reduced effect on e and on the life
table death rate.

IMPLICATIONS OF AN ALTERNATIVE
CONCEPTUALIZATION

The historical decline in mortality can
be examined in terms of both the life table
death rate and the geometric mean death
rate. Preliminary analysis of data for the
United States, England and Wales, Italy,

Japan, and Chile indicated that when
mortality is measured by del, all of those
countries had their most rapid improvement in mortality since 1945. However,
when mortality is measured by the reciprocal of the expectation of life at birth,
available data show that most Western
nations had their fastest rate of mortality
improvement by 1930 (United Nations,
1963), when they had substantially lower
life expectancies.

The pattern of differentials in mortality
as depicted by del is strikingly different
from the pattern given by the life table
death rate. Table 3 presents trends in differential mortality by sex for the five countries previously named and for Jevels of
the Coale-Demeny “West” model life tables. The ratio of male to female life table
death rates indicates that while the sex
differential may have been increasing
slowly over time, it is still quite small. In
contrast, the geometric mean death rate
shows a tremendous increase in the sex
differential over the past thirty years. For
the United States in 1970, the male del
was 79 per cent greater than the female
del, and for England and Wales and Italy

* Figures for 1930 and 1940 are three-year averages and refer to blacks and whites

males in the 1960-70 period). The geometric mean death rate not only shows that a
differential of over 60 per cent exists in
1970, but that, for both males and
females, the 1970 differential is larger than
the 1920 differential.

To explain these discrepancies, it is best
to examine some of the observed death
rates themselves. Table 5 gives the
schedules of age-specific death rates for
United States nonwhite and white females
in 1920 and 1950. Except at the high ages,

the nonwhite rate at every age is considerably larger than the white rate, and (with
one exception) the ratio increased between
1920 and 1950 at all ages under 75. The
great influence that the high ages exert on
the life table death rate produces both the
smaller differentials and the reduction in
the nonwhite/white gap over time. In this
instance, the emphasis placed by the life
table death rate on the high ages is particularly unfortunate because there is good
reason to believe that nonwhite death

rates at the high ages are substantially understated and actually exceed white rates
at least through the low 80’s (Bayo, 1972;
Hambright, 1968).

The expectation of life at birth, and its
reciprocal the life table death rate, convey
important information on the mortality
patterns of a population. However, at contemporary levels of mortality, e (the
arithmetic mean of the distribution of
deaths) is largely determined by the few
age groups which contain the great bulk of
deaths. Recent improvements in life expectancy in the West have been small and
are expected to be even smaller in the future. Thus, it is appropriate to shift attention from comparisons based on the length

of life to comparisons based on the pattern
of death, and from a conceptualization of
mortality in terms of the age pattern of
deaths to a conceptualization of mortality
in terms of the age pattern of death rates.
When del, the geometric mean of the distribution of death rates is applied to mortality data, the mortality trends and differentials which appear bring to light substantive concerns and social issues that
have so far been largely neglected.
