Racial and Cultural Differences in

Sensitivity to Flickering Light

Genetics, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado.

The assessment of racial differences in
perceptual phenomena has been largely
limited to traits for which a genetic mechanism has been demonstrated or to those for
which a substantial cultural component
might be expected (Spuhler and Lindzey,
1967). However, this approach has rarely
been employed as a first step in the study
of the genetic determinants of individual
differences in behavioral traits. The strength
of this approach rests on the assumption
“that as a consequence of the manifold
genetic differences among human populations there will be average differences for
any kind of trait that has at least in part
a genetic basis” (Mayr, 1963). Studies
based on a similar rationale, utilizing inbred
and selected strains of mice, have contributed significantly to the understanding of
genetic determinants of the behavior of
that species (McClearn, 1970).

Since race and culture are inextricably
confounded in human populations, Spuhler
and Lindzey (1967) have suggested that
the study of racial differences in behavioral
traits might most profitably be pursued
through the study of basic processes. Here,
cultural differences might be expected to be
less seriously confounded. The robustness
of the findings of population differences for

perceptual traits previously investigated——
taste sensitivity to PTC, and incidence of
color blindness—suggests that the study of
racial differences in other basic perceptual
processes might prove a valuable tool in
determining the possibility of genetic involvement. The basic processes studied in
the area of perception and psychophysics,
where reports of individual differences are
often relegated to footnote comments, provide the behavioral geneticist with a wide
variety of accurately measurable phenotypes for investigation.

In this area, critical-flicker-frequency
(CFF), as measured by the frequency at
which a flickering light appears to fuse, has
been studied as the prototypic measure of
the eye’s capacity for temporal resolution
for over two hundred years (Landis, 1953).
Recent evidence suggests that the temporal
resolution of the visual system is frequency
dependent, and more than a single process
may be involved (deLange, 1952, 1954;
Kelly, 19616, 1969). The major changes in
methodology which led to these discoveries
were (a) the use of frequency as an independent variable, and (0) the measurement
of sensitivity as the reciprocal of the modulation amplitude, m, of the stimulus field
which is required for flicker to be per

ceived. Classical CFF is therefore the
special case of sensitivity obtained with
100% modulation amplitude.

Employing these methods at a variety of
frequencies, individual differences were
noted in the sensitivity curves, obtained by
plotting m1 as a function of frequency,
by both deLange (1958) and Kelly (1962).
In addition, the individual differences demonstrated by Kelly were relatively stable
within individuals and varied considerably
among individuals. These latter conditions
suggest the possibility of genetic involvement in the determination of sensitivity to
flickering light. This possibility is further
supported by Murawski’s (1960) findings
that CFF obtained from four pairs of identical twins showed closer agreement than
those of unrelated individuals.

The objectives of this research were twofold: (a) to determine the extent of individual differences in the ability to detect
flicker in a sinusoidally modulated stimulus
at each of five frequencies and for CFF,
and (&) to determine whether population
differences might account for a significant
proportion of the observed variability.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects were twelve males and twelve
females from each of four racial groups
(Caucasian, Chinese, Japanese and PartHawaiian), students enrolled in introductory psychology at the University of
Hawaii. Each subject reported the racial
background of each of his grandparents. In
addition, each was asked to report whether
the dominant culture in his home was
Chinese, Hawaiian, Japanese, American, or
a combination of any two.

The optical design of the stimulus generator was based on that reported by Kelly
(1961a) and produced a 25° circular “edgeless field,” with a luminance of approximately two millilamberts at its center,
through the mixture of two beams of white

light from a single source. The beams were
polarized at right angles to each other, and
one was sinusoidally modulated through
the introduction of a rotating polarizing
filter. By rotation of an analyzer placed in
the final compound beam, the relative proportion of light contributed by each beam
could be varied continuously while maintaining constant average luminance. The
stimulus was projected on a piece of ground
glass and was viewed from the opposite side
through an artificial pupil, 1.55 mm. in
diameter. The temporal characteristics of
the sinusoidally modulated field, showing
luminance as a function of time, are presented in Figure 1.

A single staircase procedure for threshold
determination was used. Each subject was
presented 20 one-second trials at each of
five frequencies: 18, 14, 10, 2, and 30 Hz.,
in that order. Between trials, the stimulus
was constant and of the same time average
luminance as the test stimulus. Subjects
were asked to report whether the stimulus
was constant or flickering during each trial,
and modulation amplitude was varied from
trial to trial. A report of “flicker” led to a
decrease in modulation amplitude on the
following trial while a report of “constant”
Jed to an increase in modulation amplitude.
Forty values of modulation amplitude,
selected to approximate a logarithmic scale,
were used. The threshold value was defined
as that selected value above and below
which 50% of the “flicker” responses on
the last 14 trials occurred. Finally, CFF
was determined by increasing modulation
amplitude to 100% and varying frequency
in 0.5 Hz. steps over the final 14 of 20
trials presented as above. All subjects
except those who wore contact lenses were
tested with uncorrected vision using the
dominant eye.

stimulus intensity and threshold value,

cept the correlations between sensitivity 2
and 30 Hz. and between 2 Hz. and CFF.
In general, the magnitude of the correlations decreases as the difference between
the frequencies increases. These results are
consistent with Kelly’s (1971) hypothesis
that sensitivity at high and low frequencies
is under the control of independent mechanisms.

In order to statistically separate the effects of these processes, principal components factor analysis was applied to these
data followed by orthogonal rotation by the
varimax method. This procedure yielded
three factors, as indicated by the scree test
(Cattell, 1966), representing general sensitivity, sensitivity at high frequencies and
sensitivity at low frequencies, respectively.
Oblique rotation by the promax method
was then carried out. The resulting factor
pattern and primary factor correlations are
given in Table 2. On rotation, Factor 1 be

Scores on these three factors were obtained for each subject and analysis of

1,88; p= 0.025), race (F = 3.26; df=
3,88; p=0.025), and the sex by factor
score interaction (F = 3.97; df = 2,176;
p = 0.021). Males showed higher sensitivity than females, and members of the Caucasian sample showed the highest sensitivity
for each factor with Hawaiian, Japanese,
and Chinese following in that order. The
sex by frequency interaction indicated that
males and females differed significantly for
the low and mid-frequency factor but did
not differ significantly in high frequency
sensitivity. These results may be seen in
Table 3. The significance of the racial differences was tested by regression analysis
(Cohen, 1968) and the Chinese-Caucasian
difference was found to be significant (p <
0.05) for each factor score.

In order to separate the effects of race
and culture, regression analysis was applied
to these data with culture as the independent variable. This analysis indicated that
subjects with the Hawaiian culture represented in their homes showed the highest
sensitivity followed by the American, Japanese, and Chinese cultures, in that order.
For the mid-frequency factor, members of
the Chinese sample differed significantly
from both the Hawaiian and American
samples (¢ = 2.67, df = 92, p < 0.01; and
¢t = 2.01, df = 92, p < 0.05, respectively).
The high frequency variable revealed the
same significant differences (¢ = 3.26, df =
92,p < 0.005; and ¢ = 2.86, df = 92, p<
0.01, respectively). For the low frequency
variable, members of the American sample
differed significantly from both the Hawaiian and Chinese samples (¢ = 2.01, df
= 92, p<0.05, and ¢= 2.40, df= 92,
pb <.0.025, respectively), and the Hawaiian-Chinese difference was highly significant
(t = 3.21, df = 92, p < 0.005).

race, and on culture are presented in Table DISCUSSION

4, The extent to which culture is able to
account for variance, over and above that
accounted for by race, can be estimated by
subtraction of the second value from the
first. Similarly, to estimate the contribution
of race, independent of culture, the third
value is subtracted from the first (Cohen,
1968). These differences and their significance values are also presented in Table 4.
This analysis indicates that culture can account for from 4% to 8% of the variance
over and above that accounted for by race
alone. The variance accounted for by race,
independent of culture, does not differ significantly from zero.

The results of this research suggest that
the search for genetic determinants of individual differences in sensitivity to flickering
light might be pursued most profitably
through the comparison of members of the
Chinese and Caucasian races and their
crosses for each of the three measures of
sensitivity. From the regression analyses,
it might be argued that environmental variables have a significant effect on these dependent measures. However, race and
culture are inextricably confounded, and
this argument implicitly assumes that cultural differences are determined entirely by
environmental variables. In point of fact,
