ABSTRACT: The 1978 Contraceptive Prevalence Survey for Guatemala provides an opportunity to
examine fertility levels and a number of determinants of fertility for three broad segments of the
country: the Department of Guatemala and, in the remainder of the country, the Ladino and Indian
populations. While Ladinos had a much higher rate of contraceptive use than did Indians, the two
groups had similar birth rates. The lack of difference in fertility appears to be due to the pattern of
prolonged breastfeeding among Indians and perhaps to differences in the rate of conception due to

nutrition, coital frequency, or other factors.

The 1978 Contraceptive Prevalence
Survey for Guatemala provides an opportunity to examine fertility levels and a
number of determinants of fertility for
three broad segments of the country: the
Department of Guatemala and, in the remainder of the country, the Ladino and
Indian populations. Past demographic
studies have been based on data for small
villages or localities in the country or on
national census data. The 1978 survey is
the first national survey conducted in
Guatemala that provides data on fertilityrelated behavior. Thus, the survey provides an opportunity to relate what is
known about the dynamics of fertility
from previous studies to the national pattern of fertility variation, contraceptive
use, and related factors as measured by
the survey. For the indigena, or Indian
group, there is very little practice of contraception. Thus, other factors related to
fertility have more importance in this population, particularly nuptiality and prolonged lactation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
RESIDENCE AND ETHNIC GROUP

The survey was divided into two strata:
(1) the Department of Guatemala, containing metropolitan Guatemala City, the
national capital, and also a small rural
population, and (2) the remainder of the
country (excluding the sparsely populated
Department of Peten), termed the ‘’Interior” (see Table 1). Sufficient households
were selected in the Interior to analyze
separately the two major ethnic groups,
the indigena, or Indian group, and the Ladino, or non-Indian group. In most of the
analysis, these three categories are compared: the population of the Department
of Guatemala and Ladinos and Indians in
the Interior. In the remainder of the paper
the terms Indian and Ladino will refer to
members of these groups living outside
the Department of Guatemala.

The term Ladino is perhaps best
defined as ‘‘non-Indian,”’ the term used in

the Guatemala census publications where
the term no indigena is used for the category. Deciding whether an individual is an
Indian or not can be difficult. Indians are
concentrated in certain departments in the
central and western highlands of the country. Physical characteristics are not
definitive. Use of an Indian language,
wearing of Indian clothing, or residence in
a known Indian community are strong indications. Nevertheless, persons who
speak Spanish and wear Western clothing
can be regarded as Indian in their communities. Other factors that may indicate
whether or not an individual is an Indian
are literacy, practice of certain religious
rites, diet, type of footgear, or type of
dwelling (Van den Berghe, 1968). The important criterion, however, is the consensus of the community in which the individual resides, which may not be apparent to
outsiders, such as census-takers or survey
interviewers.

For these reasons Early (1974, 1975)
has argued that the census, which is conducted by centrally based enumerators,
regularly misclassifies Indians as Ladinos,
and therefore, the proportion of the population that is Indian based on census data
is underestimated. This creates a problem
in estimating birth rates because vital registration is performed by local officials,

who can more accurately classify births by
ethnic group. Thus, birth rates for Indians, based on accurately reported births
but underestimated population data, tend
to be biased upward. Early has proposed
corrected estimates of the proportion Indian based on the vital registration data.

Since interviewers in the 1978 survey
were not local residents of the communities in the sample, some Indians may have
been classified as Ladinos. Language and
dress were the major criteria used. (Special bilingual interviewers were used in Indian areas, and the questionnaire was
translated into the five major languages:
Cakchiquel, Kekchi, Mam, Quiche, and
Pocomchi. Of 872 Indians in the survey 89
per cent spoke an Indian language in their
homes.) As a result, 35.5 per cent of the
sample were classified as Indian in the
1978 survey compared with Early’s revised estimate for 1973 of 47 per cent. The
lower 1978 estimate may be due, in part,
to the growth of the Ladino percentage in
the interim through acculturation, but it is
probably due mainly to the more restrictive definition of “‘Indian” used in the 1978
survey. However, this should not be a major problem in making survey fertility estimates since both numerator and denominator would be based on the same
definition.

RESULTS
FERTILITY ESTIMATES FROM THE SURVEY

The survey data have been evaluated
and found to be quite consistent with data
from other sources (Anderson, 1979a).
Survey fertility estimates are somewhat
higher than those derived from vital statistics data, which may be due to underregistration of births. A tendency toward digit
preference in reporting age in the survey
apparently does not affect aggregate fertility measures.

Estimates of birth rates based on vital
statistics data suggest that national birth
rates in Guatemala since 1970 have been
lower than earlier rates but that the most
recent estimates are still quite high, with
no evidence that the crude birth rate

(CBR) has dropped below 40 births per
1,000 population (Table 2). There is no
evident downward trend since 1970.

Estimates from the survey indicate a
CBR in the mid-40’s per 1,000 overall with
arate of 35 per 1,000 in the Department of
Guatemala, 45 for Ladinos, and 48 for Indians. Confidence intervals calculated for
the CBR estimates are quite wide. (These
intervals are based on the assumption of
simple random samples. Actual intervals
are probably somewhat wider because of
the effects of clustering in the design of the
survey.) Based on the confidence intervals
in Table 3, two conclusions can be drawn:
(1) It would be difficult to make inferences
about trends by comparing survey estimates with other sources, and (2) there
does not appear to be a significant difference in the fertility of Indians and Ladinos outside of the Department of
Guatemala.

Note that although the point estimate
of CBR (45 per 1,000) is higher than re-—
cent vital statistics (39 to 41), the interval
comes close to overlapping vital statistics
values. Some evidence suggests that survey estimates of fertility rates may be
somewhat inflated relative to the true
rates. First, the point estimate of CBR is
higher than recent vital statistics estimates. If vital rates were corrected for underreporting of births, the estimates might
be somewhat closer together. Evidence
from the survey suggests that estimates of

CBR based on respondent information
might be inflated somewhat due to nonresponse. Interviews were completed for 91
per cent of households with possible respondents. The 9 per cent nonresponse
rate would bias survey estimates upward
to the extent that nonrespondents had
lower than average fertility.

One woman per household was selected as a respondent, but fertility data
were gathered for all women during the
household screening process. Of 269 possible respondents who were not interviewed, fertility data were obtained for
125 (46 per cent). While this may not be a
representative sample, the data suggest
that nonrespondents had lower fertility
than those interviewed. Standardizing for
age, nonrespondents had an average of
2.3 live births compared with 3.4 for respondents. Thus, nonresponse may have
inflated fertility estimates to some extent.
However, the general pattern of variation
in fertility appears to be accurately represented in the survey.

The similarity between the fertility
rates of the two ethnic groups has been
shown by other sources. Early (1975), for
example, reports a Ladino CBR of 42.7
per 1,000 for 1965 to 1969 and an Indian
CBR of 45.0 per 1,000. These are national
estimates. If the Ladino rates were calculated for outside the Department of
Guatemala only, as in the 1978 survey,
they would probably be somewhat higher.
Glittenberg (1976), in a comparative
study of a Ladino and an Indian town, reported CBR’s of 48.5 and 49.0 per 1,000,
respectively, for the two towns.

Similarly, census data reported by Diaz
(1977, pp. 39,67,68) indicate national
general fertility rates (GFR) for Indians of
249 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age and for Ladinos of 201 per
1,000. This compares with 1978 survey estimates of GFR of 234 per 1,000 for Indians (Table 3) and 201 per 1,000 for La
Fertility in Guatemala 23

dinos plus the Department of Guatemala
(not shown in Table 3).

These findings, then, support the pattern found of little difference between the
two ethnic groups, with perhaps slightly
lower fertility in the Ladino group.

The CBR estimate of 47.8 births per
1,000 population for Indians may seem
relatively high compared with the range of
CBR’s usually reported. However, extremely high birth rates have been reported in studies of small Indian communities in Guatemala. Early (1970), for
example, reported CBR’s of 51 to 61 per
1,000 over a period of years for the Indian
community of Santiago Atitlan. Hinshaw
et al. (1972), reporting on three villages in
the Lake Atitlan Region, report even
higher CBR’s, in some cases over 70 per
1,000. These communities are relatively
small and subject to annual variation in
births, and perhaps to distortion in the
age/sex structure; but the high reported
birth rates suggest that the survey estimates are plausible.

Data on cumulative fertility show similar differences (Table 4). Women over age
40 in the Department of Guatemala reported 5-6 children; those in the Interior,
6-7.

EVIDENCE OF TRENDS IN FERTILITY RATES

Because of the difficulty in interpreting
point estimates of fertility rates, it is
difficult to use the survey estimates to
assess trends in fertility by comparing
them with previous estimates of fertility. It is
possible to get an indication of whether
there have been recent trends in fertility
by comparing fertility in the most recent
year with cumulative fertility estimates
from the same survey. The technique used
compares the observed distribution of
mean numbers of children ever born, by
maternal age, with the distribution that
would occur if fertility rates in the previous year held constant (Potter et al.,

1976). If the ratio of cumulative fertility to
expected cumulative fertility based on recent birth rates is greater than 1, the data
are consistent with a recent decline in fertility. (This conclusion requires the assumption that births in the last year are reported accurately. We feel this
assumption can be made since women
were not asked whether they had given
birth in the last year, but rather the date of
their last live birth. The distribution of
dates does not appear distorted. Period
fertility rates were calculated by selecting
births in the twelve months prior fo interview. )

children born alive are nearly all greater

Factors UNDERLYING FERTILITY

Contraceptive Use.—The rate of contraceptive use by women in marital untons
varies in a pattern consistent with the differences found in fertility (Table 6), from
about 41 per cent in the Department of
Guatemala to 22 per cent in Ladino areas
and 4 per cent in Indian areas. Two findings stand out: (1) The prevalence rate is
quite low for the Indian group, perhaps so

low that this group may be considered subject to natural fertility conditions. (2)
While the fertility levels of Ladinos and
Indians are similar, there is a wide difference in their contraceptive use rates.
Thus, other factors must be at work in
bringing about the lack of difference in fer-.
tility between the two groups.

The estimated Ladino fertility rate (45
per 1,000) may seem too high in light of a
22 per cent contraceptive prevalence rate,
especially when viewed in the context of
various regressions of national CBR’s on
contraceptive use rates (Nortman and
Hofstatter, 1978, p. 90; Potter and Rao,
1973). However, contraceptive prevalence surveys of this type have tended to
report higher levels of contraceptive use at
given CBR’s than other sources. For example, in the Paraguay and El Salvador
surveys, the rural areas had CBR’s of 50
and 51, respectively, with 21 per cent and
26 per cent, respectively, of currently married women using contraception (Anderson, 1979). These estimates are in line
with the Ladino estimates shown here.

There are a number of possible reasons
for the difference found in this relation
ship between contraceptive prevalence
surveys and data from other sources. Previous estimates of the CBR/contraceptive
prevalence relationship were based on
family-planning~program data with some
assumption made for private-sector—
provided contraceptives. Contraceptive
prevalence surveys measure directly contraceptives from all sources and thus may
tend to uncover more use than was previously known to exist. Intervening variables, particularly nuptiality, between
CBR and contraceptive use by married
women could play a role. Rural areas typically have a higher proportion of the female population in marital unions than do
capital cities or the nation as a whole.
These factors could combine to result in
the observed high CBR’s at what seems to
be a relatively high prevalence of contraceptive use. In any case, the overall relationship between contraceptive use and
CBR found in these surveys appears about
as expected.

Nuptiality —The proportion of women
in marital unions is another factor that
tends to support observed fertility differences. Of all women 15 to 49 years old,

50 per cent in the Department of Guatemala are married compared with 70 per
cent of Ladinos and 80 per cent of Indians
in the Interior (Table 7). This is another
factor, then, that causes Indian fertility to
be higher than Ladino fertility.

Mortality —The only measure of mortality obtained in the survey was percentage of children born alive who were still
living. These data show a clear pattern of
increasing mortality going from the Department of Guatemala to the Ladino
group to the Indian group (Table 8). On
the average, 90 per cent were still living in
the Department of Guatemala, 82 per
cent in the Ladino group, and 79 per cent
in the Indian group. While these figures no
doubt reflect true differences, levels of
mortality are probably underreported in
the survey. The Indian data on surviving
children, for example, are consistent with
a life expectancy of 55 years for females
and 52 for males, using the standard Brass
Method (United Nations, 1967, pp. 74,
75). Estimates of life expectancy from the
1973 census, prepared by Diaz, (1977, p.
153) were about 48 years for the Indian
group. Early (1970) estimates that life expectancy was in the low 40’s for residents
of Santiago Atitlan in the 1960’s.

The difference between Ladinos and
Indians in child survival found in the survey is consistent with previous findings.

Compared with 48 years for Indians, Diaz
reports a life expectancy of 54 years of Ladinos. Early (1975) estimates a crude
death rate for Indians of 19.5 per 1,000 in
the late 1960’s compared with 13.1 per
1,000 for Ladinos.

The death of a child can affect fertility
in a population by terminating lactation
and shortening postpartum amenorrhea.
Hinshaw et al. (1972) believe that somewhat lower infant mortality rates were, in
part, responsible for declines in fertility
they observed from extremely high rates
to high rates. Thus, the higher mortality
for Indians might support higher fertility
relative to Ladinos as well.

PossIBLE NUTRITIONAL EFFECTS ON BIRTH
INTERVALS

The possible effect of undernutrition
on fertility is a matter of controversy, with
some studies suggesting there is some effect and other studies suggesting that fertility is little affected by the nutritional status of women. While no data were
collected in the 1978 survey on nutritional
status or birth intervals, it is worth noting
that segments of the Guatemalan population are undernourished. Early (1970)
noted the deficient diet of the Indian town
of Santiago Atitlan. A detailed prospective nutrition study in another Indian
town, Santa Maria Cauque, found the diet

of mothers to be “‘biologically inadequate” (Mata, 1978). Segments of the Ladino group have also been found to have a
deficient diet.

A study in a Ladino area, sponsored by
the Institute of Nutrition of Central
America in Panama (INCAP), suggests
that supplementing mothers’ diets can
cause somewhat shorter birth intervals by
causing shorter periods of amenorrhea
(Delgado et al., 1978). Another study of
data from this Ladino area, by Bongaarts,
and Delgado (1977), corroborates this
finding. Basing nutritional status on anthropometric measurements, they found
that women of low nutritional status had
longer birth intervals than women of
higher nutritional status; the longer intervals were due to longer periods of postpartum amenorrhea. Women in the highnutrition category had an average period
of postpartum amenorrhea of 13.2 months
compared with 14.8 months for those in
the low-nutrition group. This difference of
1.6 months represents about 5-6 per cent
of the average birth interval of 28-35
months. A difference of 5 per cent in
average birth interval would be compatible with a difference in the total fertility
rate (TFR) of, for example, 6.0 to 6.3.
While these data refer only to Ladino
women, they suggest that nutritional status could play some role in the lack of difference in Ladino and Indian fertility.

area, Santiago Atitlan, reported by
Barnett et al., (1971), indicate that birth
intervals increase with mother’s age from
22 months to 36 months. Barnett found
that mean birth intervals did not appear to
be different for the few Ladinos in his
study. Hinshaw et al., (1972) report intervals of 28 to 31 months when the initial
child survives in the Indian population
they studied. Given the differences in
these studies, nutritional effects are not
large enough to be apparent.

Based on these published studies, it
would be difficult to conclude that there is
any difference in birth interval between
the Ladino and Indian groups that might
be based on nutritional status, although |
such differences could well exist. These
birth intervals do not differ much, if at all,
from those found in Punjab, India, of 30 to
34 months reported by Potter et al. (1965)
and a mean of 33.8 for Bangladesh reported by Chen et al. (1974).

Studies from Bangladesh have found
no differences, or insignificant differences, in postpartum amenorrhea by
nutritional status (Huffman et al., 1978;
Chowdhury, 1978). The effect of nutrition
on the pattern of fertility variation in
Guatemala is thus not likely to be great,
but it may have some bearing on the lack
of difference between Indians and Ladinos.

SPONTANEOUS AND INDUCED ABORTION

The incidence of induced abortion is
poorly reported in interview surveys. In
the 1978 Guatemala Contraceptive Prevalence Survey, respondents were asked a
single question about whether they had
ever had a spontaneous or induced abortion (““Many women have pregnancies and
the result in a miscarriage (perdida) or
abortion (aborto). Have you had a miscarriage or abortion?’’); and if so, they were
asked how many.

Only 5.4 per cent of all reported pregnancies were reported as spontaneous or

 

Social Biology

induced abortions (Table 9). This is a low
percentage relative to results of prospective studies, which show that from 10 per
cent to 29 per cent of all pregnancies end
in spontaneous abortion (Chen et al.,
1974; Potter et al., 1965; French and Bierman, 1962; Shapiro et al., 1962; Warburton and Fraser, 1964; Erhardt, 1963), and
suggests that the overall level of abortion
is severly underreported in this survey.
The percentage of pregnancies ending in
abortion is somewhat higher in the Department of Guatemala, which may be
consistent with greater use of induced
abortion, but the level of abortion is still

quite low, and underreporting is no doubt
high.

Some anthropologic reports have suggested that there is very little induced
abortion in the Indian group (Hinshaw et
al., 1973; Bunzel, 1952). However, in interviews with a nonprobability sample of
71 women in an Indian village, Nick (1975,
pp. 26-29) found that attempts to bring on
the “effect of the moon” were fairly common. Sixty-four per cent of her respondents knew of someone who had attempted to induce abortion and 8 per cent
admitted attempting it themselves. However, the methods used, such as drinking
herbal preparations or the juice of sour
lemons, deliberately falling down, and
binding the abdomen, appear to have
been rarely effective. In contrast to survey
results, Glittenberg (1976, p. 94) found
somewhat higher pregnancy loss (which
includes stillbirths) in an Indian town (14
per cent ofall pregnancies) compared with
a Ladino town (10 per cent).

A higher incidence of stillbirth was reported for Indians in the survey, perhaps
related to higher overall mortality (Table
9). Incidence of abortion and stillbirth was
examined by language group to see if
there were differences that could be related to translation difficulties. It was
found that abortion, as a percentage of all
pregnancies, ranged from 0.8 per cent for
speakers of Quiche to 5.5 per cent for
speakers of Cakchiquel. The proportion
of stillbirths ranged from 0.3 per cent for
Spanish-speaking Indians to 8.6 per cent
for Cakchiquel speakers. Interestingly,
Hinsaw et al. (1972) also noted a higherthan-expected stillbirth rate for three villages in the Lake Atitlan region, two of
which were Cakchiquel-speaking. It may
be that for linguistic reasons early infant
deaths are being classified as stillbirths in
this case.

Regarding effects on fertility, then,

Fertility in Guatemala 29

there is no evidence from the survey or
elsewhere to suggest that abortion 1s an
important determinant of fertility rates,
although given difficulties in measuring
this variable, it could be important for
some segments of the population.

BREASTFEEDING PRACTICE AND
POSTPARTUM AMENORRHEA

Because of the low rates of contraceptive use, particularly among Indians, lactation could have a strong impact on fertility. The proportion of women currently
breastfeeding by duration since last live
birth was adjusted using a model breastfeeding schedule, a method described by
Lestaeghe and Page (1980) (Table 10).
The results show a pattern of prolonged
breastfeeding for women in Guatemala,
particularly among Indians. Even in the
Department of Guatemala, over half the
women were breastfeeding at twelve
months after delivery; for Indians the percentage was 86 per cent and for Ladino
women, 76 per cent.

Although no direct questions were
asked regarding postpartum amenorrhea
(PPA), Lestaeghe and Page (1980) have
proposed a method of estimating median
PPA from median length of breastfeeding. Application of this method results in
median PPA of about 12 months for the
total sample: 4 months for the Department of Guatemala, 9 months for Ladinos, and 15 months for Indians. Thus,
the effect of breastfeeding on fertility is
likely to be substantial. The 6-month difference between Ladinos and Indians
would represent 20 per cent of a birth interval of 30 months. Similar results were
found in the two towns studied by Glittenberg (1976, p. 89), with an average length
of breastfeeding of 16 months for Ladinos
and 19 months for Indians. Mean postpartum amenorrhea was 9 and 12 months, respectively.

NATURAL FERTILITY COMPARISONS

Because of the low rate of contraceptive use, fertility of the Indians might be
expected to resemble natural fertility.
Natural fertility occurs when no control is
exerted on fertility depending on the number of children already born. Stated conversely, controlled fertility occurs when
steps are taken to curtail childbearing after a certain family size is reached. Under
conditions of natural fertility, factors can
exist, such as breastfeeding, which have a
negative impact on fertility as long as
these factors are independent of family
size. According to Henry (1961, pp.
81-91), under natural fertility conditions
certain characteristic age patterns of fertility should be observed, although the level
of fertility may vary because of these nondeliberate factors. |

The Ladino population, with a moderate level of contraceptive use, has an increasing rate of use with age, but the Indian group, with a very low level of use,
has no age pattern. Thus, one might ex
pect the fertility of the Indian group to resemble a natural fertility schedule more
closely than does the fertility of the Ladino group. ©

To make this comparison, we must
confine our attention to marital fertility.
Of 210 Indian births occurring in the year
previous to the survey, four (1.9 per cent)
were to women not currently in a legal
marriage or consensual union; all four
were women in the separated/widowed/
divorced categories. Fourteen of 250 (5:6
per cent) Ladino’ births were to women
not currently in union, and only one was to
a woman who reported that she was never
married. It is possible that many of these
out-of-wedlock births could have occurred to women separated at the time of
interview but married when the birth occurred. In calculating age-specific marital
fertility rates, these births have been excluded.

Age-specific marital fertility schedules
for Ladinos and Indians are compared
with a theoretical “‘natural’’ schedule in
Table 11. The marital fertility rates are

higher for Ladinos than Indians in three of
the age groups shown. Ratios with natural
fertility schedules indicate that the Ladino
rates declined with age relative to natural
fertility, the pattern that would be expected, given deliberate control. The ratios of Indian to natural fertility rates indicate no distinct pattern with respect to
age, although the older age groups’ ratios
tend to be lower than those of the younger
groups. In the third panel of the table,
older-age-group fertility rates are compared with younger-age-group rates
within each schedule. Fertility rates for
older women are low relative to rates for
younger women for both Ladinos and Indians when compared with the natural fertility patterns.

The factor “‘m’’ has been proposed by
Coale and Trussell (1974) as a measure of
the departure of a fertility schedule from
the age pattern of natural fertility suggestive of deliberate fertility control. The
measure will equal zero under conditions
of natural fertility and increase with increasing control over fertility; it is not related to the level of fertility, only to the
age pattern. Values of m for Ladinos and
Indians fluctuate fairly widely by age
group. Average values are about the same

for the two groups. An average m of 0.18
is consistent with those of numerous other
pre-fertility-decline populations reviewed
by Knodel (1977), such as nineteenthcentury Norway (m=0.21), eighteenthcentury Sweden (m=0.20), and seventeenth- to nineteenth-century Japanese villages'(m=0.18).

With regard to a natural fertility age
pattern, the data do not suggest that Ladinos have departed from such a pattern
to a greater extent than Indians. To put it
another way, despite their lack of contraceptive use, the fertility of older Indian
women is low relative to that expected under natural fertility conditions. It could be
that older women deliberately prolong
lactation, or the effects of nutrition and
health may increase with age. In any case,
the departure of the older age groups from
anatural fertility pattern appears to be ata
level consistent with other pre-fertilitydecline populations.

THE PROXIMATE DETERMINANTS OF
FERTILITY

The apparent lack of difference in fertility rates for Ladinos and Indians can be
analyzed in terms of the underlying factors
with use of a method proposed by Bon 

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

32 Anderson et al

gaarts (1978). In this method, total fertility rate (TFR) is determined by five factors: an index of proportion married (C,,),
an index of noncontraception (C,), an index of abortion (C,), an index of lactational infecundability (C,), and a total fecundity rate (TF), the number of births
expected if none of the previous four factors act to constrain fertility. The first four
factors can range from 0 to 1.0; the total
fecundity rate has been found to range
from 13.5 to 17.0. The relationship of
these factors is as follows: TFR = C,, x C,
x C, x C; X TF. The total fecundity rate is
not known directly, but the total fertility
rate is, and the other four factors can be
estimated from data already discussed.
Total fecundity can then be estimated with
the equation shown.

When the total fecundity rate is calculated using this method and based on
TFR’s estimated for the survey, the Ladino total fecundity rate is 17.2, outside
the range reported by Bongaarts
(13.5-17.0). For this reason and because
survey fertility estimates seem slightly
high relative to vital statistics, TFR’s have
been adjusted to a level compatible with a
national CBR of 41 per 1,000. This adjustment brings the calculated total fecundity
rate into the observed range, but it does
not affect the relative impacts of the various factors.

 

Social Biology

Values for the factors are shown in
Table 12. The small number of out-ofwedlock births have been included in the
numerators of the marital fertility rates. It
is necessary to include them because TFR
is based on all births. Since the model does
not allow for out-of-wedlock births (a
much more complex model would be required), these have been included as marital births. The factor C,, the index of abortion, is equal to unity, indicating no
abortion. As discussed earlier, this survey
does not provide evidence of abortion,
and anthropological reports do not suggest that effective induced abortion is
common among Indians. To the extent
that it does exist among Ladinos or Indians, C,, should be less than 1.0, and the
fecundity rates would be higher than
shown.

The index of lactational infecundability
is based on estimated median PPA, rather
than on the mean. The use of the estimated median may somewhat underestimate the actual mean duration of PPA,
but the Ladino/Indian difference is probably accurately represented.

The decomposition shows the extent to
which proportion married and lack of contraceptive use contribute toward higher
fertility among Indians, and lactational infecundability and fecundity contribute toward lower fertility. Because of the way

the total fecundity rate, TF, is calculated,

it is dependent on the other values in the

equation and would tend to absorb
measurement errors in these factors. The
values of TF calculated based on the adjusted TFR’s indicate fecundity at minimum observed levels for Indians and in
the middle of the observed range for Ladinos. If TFR is actually somewhat higher
(as found in the survey), the values of TF
would increase somewhat, but the differential would remain.

Based on these estimated components,
the impact of the two factors exerting a
downward effect on Indian fertility can be
placed in terms of TFR. If Indians had the
same level of lactational infecundability as
Ladinos, their TFR would increase by 1.4
live births. If Indians adopted the breastfeeding pattern of the women in the Department of Guatemala, who had a median lactation period of 12.3 months and
an estimated infecund period of four
months, their TFR would increase by 2.9
live births. Thus, the prolonged lactation
of the Indian group appears to be a powerful factor which in part counteracts their
high proportions in marital union and low
levels of contraceptive use. If Indians had
the estimated total fecundity rate of Ladinos (15.6), and their own rates for the
other factors, their TFR’s would increase
by about 0.9. This suggests, then, that fecundity differences, as implied by the
model, are less important than lactational
differences. However, a difference of 0.9
represents about 15 per cent of a TFR of
6.1; this is too large a difference to be accounted for by the kinds of nutritional effects discussed earlier, which probably can
be responsible for no more than about a 5
per cent difference.

One factor not measured in the Bongaarts model is coital frequency, which
may be important in this case because
many of the Guatemalan males are migratory laborers. It has been suggested that

Fertility in Guatemala 33

nationally this migration would affect Indians more than Ladinos, since Indians
would be less likely to own sufficient farm
land to earn a living (Early, 1979, personal
communication). However, Glittenberg’s
comparative study showed that seasonal
migration was more prevalent among Ladinos; 54 per cent of Ladino households in
her study had at least one migrant worker,
compared with 23 per cent of Indian
homes (Glittenberg, 1976, p. 20). These
levels indicate how widespread the practice is. A lower coital frequency would affect the conception rate and, in the model,
would be reflected by a lower total fecundity.

Data from the survey on percentage of
women currently pregnant suggest that
the difference in the total fecundity factor
is genuine (whether this difference is
caused by nutrition, coital frequency, or
some other factor). Overall, 12 per cent of
Indian women and 11 per cent of Ladino
women reported themselves to be pregnant. When attention is limited to women
currently in union who have never used
contraception, are not currently breastfeeding, and have had at least one live
birth, and when duration since the last live
birth is controlled for, a lower percentage
of Indian women were pregnant (Table
13). The Indian/Ladino ratio of this standardized percentage pregnant is 0.84, compared with a ratio of 0.87 for total fecundity rate (TF). This finding provides, then,
an independent test of the difference in TF.
A difference of the magnitude found is
consistent with the difference in percentage pregnant, when other related factors
are controlled for. This difference supports the conclusion that the difference in
TF is not due to errors in the measurement,
of the other factors, and the relationships
found in the model can be taken seriously.

Finally, the comparative study by Glittenberg (1976) of a Ladino and an Indian
town found that for most fertility determi

nants, differences were in the same direction as in the 1978 survey. Fertility levels
were nearly equal in the two towns. Age at
marriage and a low rate of contraceptive
use (3.6 per cent for Indians and 15.8 per
cent for Ladinos) favored higher fertility
in the Indian town. These factors were

compensated by longer birth intervals for
Indians related to significantly longer
breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea.

Regarding the survey data, then, it can be
concluded that the similarity of Indian and
Ladino birth rates is plausible in view of their
different rates of contraceptive use and differences in breastfeeding practices.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Overall fertility levels from the 1978
Contraceptive Prevalence Survey for
Guatemala were consistent with what was
known previously from census data and
studies of small villages and localities. The
survey data offer some new insights into
the national pattern of fertility variation.
Crude birth rates were found to be in the
30’s per 1,000 population for the Department of Guatemala and in the 40’s per
1,000 population in the remainder of the
country.

Despite similar birth rates for the two
groups, Ladinos had a much higher rate of
contraceptive use than did Indians. The
lack of difference in fertility appears to be
due to the pattern of prolonged breastfeeding among Indians, and perhaps to differences in the rate of conception due to nutrition, coital frequency, or other factors.
