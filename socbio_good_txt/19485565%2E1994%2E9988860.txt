ABSTRACT: Weaning at an appropriate age with appropriate foods is vital for the growth and
health of infants. Weaning beliefs and practices were studied in two representative rural villages
in Bangladesh by interviews with 180 mothers with infants between 4 and 12 months of age.
Maternal parity and family size were not found to be related to weaning age. Family income and
maternal education were consistently related to appropriate weaning. Bivariate controlled analysis showed that a mismatch between mothers’ responses and actual weaning behavior toward
infants 4-6 months old could be attributed to family poverty.

Weaning is the process of gradual
termination of an infant’s diet from
breast milk to a family diet. The process of weaning should be of major
concern in communities where income
is low, knowledge about infant nutrition is poor, and environmental conditions are deleterious (Reddy, 1987).
Malnutrition in infants in these countries make them susceptible to infection and increased mortality (Jelliffe,
1986). Nutritional deficiency occurring
in childhood may have adverse lifelong mental and physical consequences. Malnutrition is widespread in
most developing countries, and the
condition is particularly serious in children less than three years of age. In
many areas prolonged breast feeding
is common, and nutritional problems
generally arise after the first year of life
due to delayed supplementation and
inadequate weaning foods (Mitznerk
et al., 1984).

The weaning period generally begins around the fourth month (WHO/
UNICEF, 1979; Jelliffe and Jelliffe,
1978). The age at which weaning is begun has been found to increase with de
78

creasing family income and vice versa
(Geervani, 1983). Many mothers believe that as long as there is enough
breast milk, the child may not need
any other food. Thus, the main defect
in the current feeding practice is delayed supplementation and/or abrupt
change in the food type. Attitude and
knowledge are strongly influenced by
socioeconomic status. In the same religious or cultural group, different
weaning practices may be used commensurate with different income and
educational levels (Geervani, 1983).
Although economic status, maternal
education and parity, family size, and
sociocultural norms have been associated with appropriate weaning practices, their relative importance has
rarely been assessed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This retrospective study was carried
out in February and March of 1989 in
two villages, Digarkanda and Bhatibarea, in the district of Mymensingh in
Bangladesh. The study sites were selected purposively as representative of

rural society of Bangladesh which has
been observed to be relatively homogeneous. All mothers, 180 in all, having children aged 4 to 12 months were
studied. A structured questionnaire
was developed and verified by a pretest
before its use.

All the eligible mothers in the selected villages were interviewed by
making door-to-door visits. The mothers were interviewed about their socioeconomic and demographic conditions
and on the weaning status of their
babies.

Data were analyzed to ascertain the
role of socioeconomic and demographic factors on the practice of weaning of these rural mothers in Bangladesh. Stratification was done to
control the interacting variables. Chisquare tests were done when considered appropriate for obtaining a conclusion.

RESULTS

Of the 180 mothers, 80 had children
less than 6 months of age. Only 16 out
of the 80 (20 per cent) had put their
babies on a weaning diet. In total, 74
mothers (40 per cent) had weaned or
were in the process of weaning their
babies by 12 months of age (Table 1).
In contrast to actual practice, a higher
number of mothers (19 mothers, 24
per cent) having infants of less than 6
months of age thought that weaning
should be done at least by the sixth
month of an infant’s age, and 85 per
cent of them thought that weaning
should be completed by 12 months of
age (Table 2).

Of mothers having infants less than
6 months of age who did not wean their
babies, 73 per cent thought that their

infants had not reached the proper
age for weaning. Of these mothers, 19
per cent thought that weaning at this
age would harm their infants physically. In contrast to the conventional
belief, only 8 per cent of the mothers
blamed their poverty for not weaning
their babies (Table 3).

Maternal education, family size,
mother’s parity, and monthly family income were analyzed to see their roles
as determinants of weaning at an appropriate age. Although an influence
of maternal education was observed, a
more consistent relationship was obtained between weaning at an appropriate age and monthly family income
(Table 4 and 5) (p< 0.001). Further

analyses of these two variables were
done by stratification. Among the families with the highest monthly income,
parity or family size as usual did not
show any consistent pattern (data not
shown). The effect of maternal education, however, became more consistent now in these families. On the
other hand, the effect of maternal education was lost when the respondents
belonged to the lowest income group
(Table 6). Moreover, the effect of family income was strong even when the
respondents were illiterate (Table 7).

DISCUSSION

Although the sites for this study
were selected purposively, the study
individuals selected were similar to the
population of other areas of Bangladesh in terms of the rates of literacy
and age-wise weaning (Haque et al.,
1987). Similar economic patterns and
average family size have also been observed throughout Bangladesh in general (BBS, 1986).

Since appropriate weaning in terms
of the age of weaning and the type of
weaning food is so important, studies
abound on this topic, especially in developing countries. The most probable
factors that could possibly influence
this practice may be the economic sta

tus, level of family education, maternal
parity and family size, and the socioreligious culture (Greevani, 1983). These
factors may influence weaning positively or negatively, directly and/or indirectly in conjunction with other cofactors. Higher parity, which may be a
surrogate of a larger family size, could
have a negative impact not only due to
financial constraints, but also due to
the less time that a mother has to spend
on each of her children. On the other
hand, with a higher parity a mother is
supposed to develop more skill in child
rearing. In effect, the role of these variables, however, have seldom been substantiated.

Social customs are intricately interwoven with the economic status and
the level of family education. In this
study, only 19 per cent of the respondents who did not wean their infants
despite their appropriate age indicated
a cultural taboo as a cause. This finding
shows that in at least 80 per cent of the
cases factors like level of education and
family income could be the most important determinants of an appropriate
weaning (Greevani, 1983). Level of
education, which has a confounding
relationship with economic status,
sometimes is seen as the most important influencing factor in this regard
(Greevani, 1983; Kabirullah et al.,
1987). However, when appropriately
controlled, the role of economic status
seems to be more important than maternal education as has been shown in
this study (Tables 4 through 7). It may,
however, be possible that while income
has stronger association with the age of
weaning, maternal education may provide greater flexibility in the selection
of the type of weaning food when the
family economic status is better.

*Religious education.

The appetite of a child has also been
noted to influence the age and food of
weaning (Greevani, 1983), but appetite in fact is often only a reflection of
malnutrition resulting from poverty
and low maternal education. Working

status of mothers has been observed to
hasten the age of weaning. All in all,
family income and maternal education
seem to be the main determinants of
the age and food of weaning, respectively, either directly or indirectly.

A unique and interesting observation in this study has been the
mismatch between the actuality of
weaning practices and the responses
obtained in the case of the nonweaning
of infants at 4 to 6 months of their age.
Although 73 per cent of the mothers
suggested that infants 4 to 6 months old
are not old enough for weaning, and
only 8 per cent of the respondents

blamed poverty as the reason for not
weaning at this age, bivariate controlled analysis in this study brought
out the fact that poverty in fact is the
most compelling reason for nonweaning at an appropriate age. This fact indicates the responses of the study subjects may mislead a researcher if taken
at face value.
