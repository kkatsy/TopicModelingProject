-CABSTRACT: This paper studies the relationship between three aspects of female status (educaEtion, work experience, and age at marriage) and the use of contraception and fertility in Banglaodesh. Education is found to be the variable most strongly correlated with use of contraception

Aand is also one of the significant variables explaining fertility behavior. The most important

“factor explaining fertility behavior is age at marriage. The higher the age at marriage, the lower

othe fertility, when all other factors are held constant. Work experience has very little or no effect

coon current use of contraception and fertility.

data collected by the Bangladesh Fertility Survey (BFS) of 1975.

ELABORATION OF
HYPOTHESES

Education has consistently been
shown to be inversely related to fertility,
and it is often said that higher education
leads to greater use of contraception
and, consequently, to lower fertility
(Coale, 1965; Berelson, 1976). Education is a very complex variable. It is being used as a proxy measure of the opportunity cost of housewife’s time
(Mincer, 1963), a measure of the formation of taste and preferences (Easterlin,
1969) or one’s socioeconomic status
(Leibenstein, 1974), and also as a proxy
measure of modernization (Inkeles,
1974). Leaving aside these complexities,
one may point out several indirect ways
in which education may affect fertility
behavior. These are as follows: Education not only provides opportunities for
personal advancement, awareness of so

cial mobility, and higher nonfamilial aspirations but also a new outlook, freedom from tradition, willingness to
analyze institutions, values and patterns
of behavior, and growth of rationalism.
It may also reduce desired family size by
raising desired living standards and provides a greater range of general information, better understanding of the reproductive process, and access to modern
and effective means of birth control.
Moreover, it is expected that an educated mother will take better pre- and
post-natal care, and this will increase the
chances of survival of infants. Higher
chances of survival of infants may lead
to reduction in desired family size.!
Thus, education is likely to be positively
associated with use of contraception and
negatively with fertility.

Greater female participation in the
labor force has often been suggested as a
means of reducing fertility. This suggestion is based on the assumption that employment outside the home provides alternative satisfactions for women which
may compete with her raising children
(Berelson, 1969; Blake, 1965; Collver,
1966; Collver, 1962; Jaffe, 1959; Kasarda, 1971; Kirk, 1965). If work outside
the home competes with child rearing,
working women would be expected to
practice contraception more frequently
and to have fewer children than nonworking women. Moreover, married
women who wish to continue working
outside the home must practice contraception more effectively.

The current theory regarding female
labor force participation and fertility
postulates that female labor force par

mortality among the poor and less educated induces them to have more children in order to ensure survival of at least a few into adulthood.

ticipation will not result in lower fertility
per se unless there is greater incompatibility between the roles of mother and
worker (United Nations, 1975). If the
degree of role incompatibility is the pivotal factor in determining the differences in fertility levels between working
and nonworking women, such differentials among rural women should be
smaller than among urban women. In
rural areas, women are mainly engaged
in farm work which does not necessarily
take a married woman far from her
home. Moreover, in rural areas,
mother-substitutes who can help look
after children and other domestic chores
are more likely to be available. Conversely, work in the modernized sector
of the economy in urban areas means
separation of work from home, and substitute parents are rare. Role conflict is
thus more likely among women working
in urban areas, particularly in big industrial centers and metropolitan areas.
However, it is not clear whether women
have fewer children because they work,
or work because they have fewer children. Moreover, it has been argued that
it is not labor force participation per se
which affects fertility but a series of
other variables associated with labor
force participation, such as age at marriage, longer period of schooling, etc.
Lower fertility among working women
is also sometimes attributed to subfecundity which is usually found to be
higher among working women (Freedman et al., 1959). Some of these problems are overcome here by confining the
study to fecund married women for rural and urban areas separately and by introducing more control variables while
examining the net effect of female participation in the labor force on the practice of contraception and fertility behavior.

Age at marriage is considered to be
one of the most important variables affecting fertility behavior, particularly in
a noncontraceptive society. Marriage is
an event that marks the beginning of the
period of potential childbearing. Late
age at marriage may affect cumulative
marital fertility by shortening the duration of marriage within the reproductive
span. Moreover, delayed marriage may

be considered as a deliberate attempt on
= the part of a woman to restrict her fertil“ity, among other reasons. Therefore,
Sshe is likely to practice contraception

Amarriage may not lead to lower comcopleted family size if women desire a
large family, and women married at the
cohigher ages try to compensate for their

Ssspacing. But this is not likely to happen.
"S Rele (1962) observed that the effort to

z It should be noted here that delayed

married at an early age and still have
§ fewer children by practicing contracepA tion more effectively. Moreover, age at
marriage may not have any significant
bearing on fertility in societies like those
of the Caribbean where there is vast acceptance for children being born outside
legal wedlock. Therefore, the negative
association between age at marriage and
family size is likely to be more pronounced in a situation where very little
effort is being made to control fertility
within marriage and children are born
within legally constituted wedlock.
Bangladesh is a noncontraceptive soci

ety’, and almost all children are born
within legal marriage. We would, therefore, expect to find age at marriage is
positively associated with use of contraception and negatively with fertility.

In this paper, we shall try to determine the independent effects of these
three variables on fertility and use of
contraception for rural and urban areas
separately. The reasons for looking at
the above relationships for rural and urban areas separately are to bring homogeneity to the study and to avoid the
confounding effects of residence on
tastes or lifestyles. Moreover, critical
examination of the work-fertility hypothesis requires its testing in an urban
setting where role incompatibility between mother and worker is likely to be
more acutely felt.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data employed in this study are from
the Bangladesh Fertility Survey (BFS)
of 1975. The BFS was based on a national probability sample of evermarried women under the age of 50
years. The data were collected by a
house-to-house survey using a structured interview schedule. The survey
yielded 6,515 completed interviews with
eligible respondents. Of these women,
5,025 were from rural and 1,490 were
from urban areas. A three-stage sample
design was adopted for the rural and urban strata. The first two stages were area
selections and the ultimate stage was
household selection. In the first two

2According to latest available data, only 9.6 per
cent of currently married women who are at risk of
pregnancy were practicing contraception in 1975
(See Government of People’s Republic of Bangladesh. Ministry of Health and Population Control,
1975 Bangladesh Fertility Survey Report, Dacca,
1978).

stages the selection was done with probability proportional to size, and in the
last stage selection was done with probability inversely proportional to the number of households. This made the sample theoretically self-weighting within
each stratum, urban and rural. Weighting is necessary only for the national and
regional estimates (see for details, 1975
Bangladesh Fertility Survey Report).

THE Stupy POPULATION

The present study is limited to
“women who were married only once,
currently living with their husbands and
reported to be fecund”’? which is a subsample of the Bangladesh Fertility Survey (BFS). Although, 4,794 such
women (3,677 rural and 1,117 urban)
form the core group‘ for analysis in the
present study, the actual analysis will be
based on a number fewer than these
cases because of nonresponse to one or
more pertinent interview questions used
in this study. The core group for analysis
constitutes 74 per cent of the total sample and 73 per cent and 75 per cent of rural and urban samples and also accounts
for 94 per cent of those women who are
married only once and currently living
with their husbands.

There are specific reasons for confining the study to only “‘once married,

3Fecund women are those who said “No” when
asked, ‘“‘Do you think you or your husband have
any physical difficulty so that you may not have a
child?” This measure of fecundity is based on the
women’s perception of fecundability and may not
necessarily be indicative of the true level of infecundity in the society.

4Women who have voluntarily sterilized themselves to restrict fertility were included in our core
group for analysis. There were sixty such cases.
Even when these women are excluded from the
analysis, the findings reported here remains unchanged in terms of both pattern and magnitude.

fecund women who are currently living
with their husbands.” These reasons are
as follows: (i) fertility pattern and use of
contraception are most conveniently
studied for currently married who are
living with their husbands; (ii) any study
of fertility differentials caused by social
factors must be confined to fecund
women.

INDEPENDENT VARIABLES

The three independent variables
used in this analysis were defined as follows:

1. Education.—Level of education
was determined in terms of the highest
grade passed. The determining question
was, ‘“What was the highest level of education you have passed?” It is categorized as follows: (i) no formal education;
(ii) 1-5 grade; (iii) 6-9 grade; (iv) secondary and above.

2. Work Experience.—Working
women in this study are those who have
been occupied in activity aside from doing household work for cash or kind.
Nonworking women are those who
never participated in gainful activities
outside domestic chores. The determining questions were: (i) ““Are you doing
any work (for cash or kind) at the
present time?” (ii) “Did you do any such
work at any time before you were first
married?’”’ Answers to the above two
questions are combined to determine
the work status of a woman in this study.
It is categorized into (i) ever worked
(i.e., worked at some point in life) and
(ii) never worked.

3. Age at Marriage.—Data on each
marriage was obtained by asking, “In
what month and year were you married?” If the date of current marriage
was not known, the age at marriage was
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

Vol. 31, No. 1-2

sought by asking, “How old were you
then?” It should be pointed out that the
stated age at marriage may not necessarily coincide with the date of consummation of marriage in Bangladesh. The reported average interval between
marriage contract and consummation of
marriage was only 0.4 years.° Age at
marriage is classified into five categories: (i) under 15, (ii) 15-17, (iii) 18-19,
(iv) 20-21, and (v) above 21 years.

DEPENDENT VARIABLES

Number of children ever born alive
and the use of contraception are the two
dependent variables used in this study.
The total number of children ever born
was obtained by summing the number of
live births reported in the pregnancy history. Pregnancy history data were collected by a sequential approach which
required detailed probing for events in
each segment of a woman’s reproductive life—from marriage to first live
birth, first live birth to second and so on,
to the last open interval. The figures on
total number of children ever born are
usually understated because of recall
lapse. This is likely to vary with level of
education, age, and other factors. We
have no means of estimating the level of
understatement or its differential impact. However, the sequential approach
adapted here to build pregnancy history
will enable women to reconstruct their
pregnancy histories more accurately
since it helps to minimize memory lapse
and misplacement of events in the time
scale of their reproductive life. Contraceptive status was measured in terms of

age at consummation of marriage are 12.7 and 13.1

current use® and ever use.’ Information
on current use of contraception is reported to be somewhat underestimated
in both rural and urban setting of
Bangladesh (Green, 1969; Stoeckel and
Mogbul, 1969). We have no means of
estimating to what extent this holds true
in the present survey.

RESULTS

The relationship between use of contraception and three independent variables is shown in Table 1. For the entire
sample, education and age at marriage
stand out as the most important factors,
followed by work experience, affecting
the use of contraception, whether measured by current use or ever use. The
contraception increases with each increase in educational level, rising from 8
per cent for women with no education to
42 per cent at the highest level.

The similar pattern of positive relationship also exists between age at marriage and use of contraception. The use
of contraception is at least 22 percentage
points higher among women who were
married at the age of 22 and above compared to those who contracted their
marriage at very early ages of less than
15 years.

The expected negative relationship
between women’s work experience and
use of contraception is confirmed by

6Current users are those who reported themselves as currently practicing some method of contraception and could mention the name of method
now being practiced. The question asked to determine the status of current use of contraception
was, ‘‘Are you or your husband currently using a
method to keep you from getting pregnant? If yes,
mention the method.”

7Ever users include those who are currently
practicing some method of contraception and also
those who used some method at some previous
stage of their marriage.

data. But differences in the current use
of contraception between women of
varying work experiences are not very
large. For example, the current use of
contraception is only 2 percentage
points higher among ever-worked
women compared to those who have
never worked. However, this small vari
ation becomes larger when we employ
“ever-use”’ as our measure of contraception status.

The results presented above represent the overall relationship between
each of the independent variables and
use of contraception for the sample as a
whole. However, what is true for the

Vol. 31, No. 1-2

group as a whole may not be true for its
constituent parts. It can be seen from
the data presented in Table 1 that at
each level of education and age at marriage the use of contraception is higher
in urban than in rural areas. Moreover,
the use of contraception (measured either as current use or ever use) increases
monotonically with each increase in
level of education and age at marriage
on one hand and use of contraception on
the other in urban areas. But a similar
picture is lacking in rural areas where we
find women with secondary education
use contraception less than do women
who finished sixth to ninth grade. Similarly, the use of contraception is somewhat lower among women who are married at the highest ages (i.e., 22 years
and above) compared to those who are
in the immediate preceding highest age
at marriage category (i.e., 20-21 years).
These results may be attributed, along
with others, to sample fluctuation associated with small number of cases in the
highest education and age at marriage
categories in rural areas.

It may be further observed from Table 1 that the distribution of cases
among categories of independent variables is more spread out in urban than in
tural areas. This factor of relatively
wider variation of cases among levels of
independent variables and also the effect of urbanization may account for the
stronger relationship between the independent variables and the use of contraception in urban than in rural areas.
However, this difference may also arise
out of variations in the socioeconomic
and demographic backgrounds of the
respondents in rural and urban areas.
This problem will be taken care of when
we find out the net effect of an independent variable on the use of contraception within each residential group.

65

We have so far examined the relationship between each of the three independent variables and the use of contraception separately. In order to examine
the net effect of independent variables
on the use of contraception, we have
used Maximum Likelihood Logit Technique because the dependent variable is
dichotomous. Logit is a type of regression with a transformed dependent variable.’ Its functional form is as follows:

P
1-P

log. = Bo + Bir... + Bren

where P is the probability of contraception use (or the event occurring), Bo to
B, are the coefficients, and X; to X,, are
independent variables. Under this approach, the dependent variable for each
observation in our study takes the value
of one if the respondent is currently
practicing contraception, while a value
of 0 is assigned to those individual
women who are not currently practicing
contraception. The results based exclusively on binary explanatory variables
are presented in Table 2. From these
results, we will be able to ascertain the
net effect of each of the independent
variables on current use of contraception. As expected, propensity to use
contraception is positively associated
with level of education, work experience, and age at marriage for the entire
sample. Women with the highest education (secondary and above) are more
likely to use contraception than are
women who have no formal education.
Similarly, women with 6-9 grade and
primary (1-5) level education are more

value of the regression coefficient rises
from 0.692 to 1.684 as one moves from
lowest to the highest education category.

The women who have ever worked
are also more likely to use contraception
than those who have never worked. The
probability of using contraception increases by at least 0.208 among the

Women who are married at higher

who married at the youngest ages (i.e.,
less than 15 years). The propensity to

the independent variables are in the expected direction, the differences in use
of contraception are not all statistically
significant. For example, the propensity
to use contraception among women
gainfully employed outside the home
does not differ significantly from those
who have never worked. Similarly, propensity to use contraception between
women married at the lowest age (i.e.,
< 15 years) and all other women is not
found to be statistically significant. The
only significant differences in the propensity to use contraception is found between women with no formal education
and all other women. The above pattern
of relationship also holds for rural and
urban areas with the exception that in
rural areas the propensity to use contraception among women with the highest
education is not significantly higher than
those with no formal education. Again,
this may be attributed to a very small
number of cases (see Table 1) in the
highest education category in rural area.
The propensity to use contraception
among women with primary level education (1-5 grade) is not significantly
higher than that of those with no formal
education in urban areas. But this is not
true in rural areas. It may also be observed from Table 2 that the propensity
to use contraception among women who
have ever worked outside the home is
not significantly higher than that of
those who have never worked irrespective of residential background. Moreover, the negative relationship observed
between work status and use of contraception in urban areas is contrary to our
expectation. We would expect to find
this relationship more positive and
stronger in urban than in rural areas,
given the higher incompatibility between the role of worker and mother in
the former than in the latter area.

From the above findings, it clearly
emerges that education is the most important variable affecting the use of contraception. Education explains about 2
per cent of the variance in use of contraception over and above that which can
be explained by all other variables together for the entire sample. For rural
and urban areas, these figures are 1.3
per cent and 3 per cent respectively.

We have also examined the number
of children ever born in relation to education, work experience, and age at
marriage. The data are presented in Table 3. The results resemble those obtained for use of contraception. Education emerges as the most important
variable, followed by age at marriage
and work experience. The mean number of children ever born decreases as
level of education rises. For the total
sample, those who have had no formal
education average two more children
than those who are high school graduates and above. A similar difference is
observed in both rural and urban areas.

In contrast, the fertility of ever
worked womenis little higher than those
with no work experience. The difference between women who are married
at the youngest ages (i.e., < 15 years)
and those at the highest ages is at least
one child for each subgroup in the study
population. However, if this comparison is made between the youngest (i.e.,
<15 years) and those at the next to
highest age-at-marriage groups (i.e.,
20-21 years), the difference works out
to be at least two children. In other
words, the fertility of women who are
married at 20-21 years is higher than
that of those married at the highest ages,
i.e., 22 years and above. However,
these irregularities were removed when
adjustment is made for the effect of

In order to examine the net effect of
the independent variables on the dependent variable (i.e., number of children
ever born), we have used Dummy Variable Regression. Here, each dummy
variable represents a single subclass of a
factor. An individual is assigned a value
of unity if she belongs to the subclass
and zero if she does not. Each subclass
of the variable is considered as a sepa

rate regressor (Fieldstein, 1966). The
use of dummy variable regression does
not involve making any assumptions
about the linearity of the effect (Suits,
1957). The relationship between the dependent variable (fertility) and the independent variables (education, work experience, age at marriage, etc.) is
analyzed by ordinary least squares. The
net effect of each of the independent
variables is shown in Table 4. The
results of this analysis somewhat alter

the earlier conclusion based on bivariate
relationship that education is the most
important factor affecting fertility, followed by age at marriage and work experience. We now find that the age at
marriage is the most important factor
explaining fertility, followed by education and work experience when adjustment is made for the effect of other variables. These results also differ from
those obtained for use of contraception.
With regard to use of contraception, education was found to be the single most
important explaining factor.

Age at marriage explains at least 2
per cent of variance in fertility over and
above that which can be explained by all
other variables together for rural areas,
urban areas, and for the total sample.
For the sample as a whole, we find that
the probability of having a child declines
with the increase in the level of age at
marriage. Fertility at each level of age at
marriage is significantly different from
fertility for women who are married at
very early ages (i.e., less than 15 years).
The effect of age at marriage on fertility
becomes apparent, even if marriage is
contracted before ages 20-21 years. This
pattern holds for both rural and urban
areas.

For the sample as a whole we find
that the probability of having children
declines with increase in the level of female education particularly from 6~9
grade onward. The fertility of women
with primary level education (1-15
grade) does not differ significantly from
that of women with no education. However, the fertility of women with no formal education is significantly higher
than that of women with 6-9 grade education and of those with secondary level
and above. This pattern also holds at
least for the urban area. The picture
changes somewhat in rural areas where

we find that fertility declines gradually
as the level of education increases from
zero to below secondary level (6-9
grade) and thereafter it increases
slightly. In other words, the women with
secondary and higher level of education
are likely to have more children than
those with below secondary level education (i.e., 6-9 grade). However, the fertility at each level of education is not
significantly different from fertility for
women with no formal education in the
rural area. This finding may arise out of
very little variation among education
categories in rural areas.’

The working women for the sample
as a whole and for the urban area tend to
have lower fertility than those who have
not worked. However, this difference in
fertility between working and nonworking women is not Statistically significant.
This pattern changes in the rural area
and when the fertility of working
women is slightly higher, although not
significantly, than that of the nonworking women. This may be due to compatibility of the roles of being mother and
worker in rural area.

DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION

The purpose of this paper has been to
study the relationship between certain
aspects of female status (i.e., education,
work experience, and age at marriage)
and the use of contraception and fertility. Of the three variables studied, education is found to be the one most
strongly correlated with the use of contraception. It is also one of the signi
*More than 76 per cent of the cases are concentrated in the ‘‘no formal” education category.
Those who have attained 6-9 grade and secondary
and above constitute 3 per cent and less than 1 per
cent of the total rural sample respectively.

ficant variables explaining fertility behavior. The effect of education on the
use of contraception and fertility is
found within each subgroup of the study
population, particularly in the urban
area and for the sample as a whole. Education of girls up to grade 6-9 can go a
long way toward achieving a major
breakthrough in the use of contraception and in lowering fertility. However,
our data do not show whether contraception and fertility among women with
higher education are affected by specific
knowledge, increased rationalization,

or the greater opportunities afforded by
acquired skills, or whether education is
merely a proxy measure of socioeconomic status.

Age at marriage is found to be the
most important factor explaining fertility behavior. The higher the age at marriage, the lower the fertility, when all
other factors are held constant. This depressing effect of age at marriage on fertility holds for every subgroup of the
study population. Raising age at marriage beyond 17 years can bring about a
substantial reduction in fertility for a

noncontraceptive society like Bangladesh. However, it is not known from our
data whether the higher age at marriage
leads to lower fertility either through
mere shortening of reproductive span or
through greater motivation of these
women to regulate their fertility. Higher
age at marriage may itself indicate a
strong desire on the part of the women
to control fertility which in turn may be
affected by their higher education and

women, is lacking. (iii) The working

According to the latest available data (1974
population census), only 30 per cent of women in
the labor force were in the nonagricultural sector
in 1974. Of these who were in the nonagricultural
sector, nearly 79 per cent were accounted for by
the tertiary and service sectors.

their parental and their husbands’ education and income (Chaudhury, 1978).
This poor socioeconomic background
may be positively associated with fertility which may have attenuated the depressing effect of work on fertility.

The overall finding that work experience has little or no effect on fertility
does not necessarily contradict previous
findings elsewhere. Few studies have
provided the careful control for age,
parity, education, age at marriage,
standard of living, etc., which we have
used. Thus, some of the reported effects
of female work experience may simply
reflect the co-variation of work experience with these variables.

Poticy IMPLICATIONS

The study points to the need to improve women’s status, particularly education, and also to raise age at marriage
to obtain wider diffusion of contraception and successful reduction in fertility.
Age at marriage can be raised through
providing education and employment
opportunities to women, and this finding is also borne out by data (Chaudhury
and Nilufer, 1981) obtained from
Bangladesh.

To improve the educational status of
women, there is need to open more
girls’ schools and to change social attitudes on female education. In a traditional Muslim society like Bangladesh,
co-education is not socially acceptable,
particularly in rural areas. But there is a
tremendous lack of girls’ schools in
Bangladesh.!! Mere expansion in girls’
schools does not necessarily lead to

Tn 1974-75, there were only 243 girls’ primary
schools in a country of 64,000 villages. The number
of girls’ secondary schools was only 1,106 in 197475 (Dacca University, 1977).

more female education unless social attitudes are also changed. Parents prefer
to seek higher education for sons rather
than daughters, mainly because boys are
considered a greater economic asset to
the family than are girls.!2 In addition,
there is a need for a persistent drive
against those social customs, beliefs,
and traditions which belittle the value of
women as compared to men. Efforts
must be made to change attitudes that
women are inferior to men” and that
“motherhood” is the most desirable role
for a woman.

Advocates of family planning argue
that reductions in fertility would permit
women to pursue higher education and
gainful employment in order to attain
higher social status. But it can be equally
forcibly argued that women who have
attained higher status will want to practice contraception. Consequently, the
raising of women’s status appears crucial in the attempt to create an environment in which women will want to practice contraception in order to reduce
fertility.

However, the effect on fertility and
practice of contraception of introducing
compulsory secondary education will be
slow in a society where a majority of the
people are illiterate. According to the
1974 Census of Bangladesh only 14.1

‘2AM the male respondents in a recent village
study considered sons as an economic asset and
none had such expectation for the girls. In the
above study it was also found that the fathers
wanted their boys and girls to be high school graduates and primary school graduates respectively
(Chaudhury and Latif, 1976).

Bt was found in a study in Bangladesh that 70
per cent of rural and 80 per cent of urban men, respectively, considered women as inferior to men
(Rounagq, 1975).

 

Social Biology

per cent of males and 2.9 per cent of females aged 15 and above were reported
to have completed 6-10 years of education (Rabbani et al., 1976). Though the
journey may be iong and arduous, it
must be started immediately. In the
meantime, along with efforts to provide
compulsory formal education at least up
to secondary level, some kind of nonformal education should also be introduced. Employment opportunities outside the home may provide an effective
forum of nonformal education, and this
may lead to control of fertility through
wider use of contraception, particularly
among illiterate women. This is also
borne out by data of the present study"
and those of other studies in Bangladesh
(Chaudhury, 1978). For illiterates, alternative satisfactions to children are
very limited. Participation in the labor
force not only provides such alternative
satisfactions but also provides further
opportunities for acquiring new skills
and techniques which may broaden
their outlook and this may lead to wider
use of contraception and reduction in
fertility among illiterate women. For
higher-education women, employment
outside the home is one of the several alternative satisfactions to children.

For an effective lowering of fertility,
the female age at marriage must be
raised above 17 years. However, there
are difficulties in implementing a
minimum-age marriage law in a society
like Bangladesh where social, religious,
and economic pressures on girls to
marry at an early age remain very

strong. In this society, a girl unmarried
past a certain age may be considered an
embarrassment or disgrace to the family
and it is also an economic burden on the
parents to maintain an unmarried gir)
who is economically unproductive. In
this situation concurrent measures of
obvious benefit to the girls and their
families, such as providing education
and employment opportunities, have to
be taken for the effective implementation of a minimum-age marriage law.
