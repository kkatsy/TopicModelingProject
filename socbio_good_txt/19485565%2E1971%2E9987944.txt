Assessing Mortality and Morbidity
Disadvantages of the Black Population

of the United States

Gordon F. Sutton

Department of Sociology
University of Massachusetts
Amherst, Massachusetts

A description of mortality and morbidity differentials by race in the context of
social and economic inequalities is hard to
come by. This is true because the kinds of
statistics that might be most useful for this
purpose are not usually available. Changes
in the character of mortality and morbidity
over the last hundred years may have had
some important influence regarding why
this is so.

A review of mortality trends since 1800,
from data for areas such as New York City
which have such historical series, is instructive. Such a series displays a pronounced
raggedness over the nineteenth century
which is replaced by a smoother figure
associated with a monotonic reduction in
mortality in the twentieth century. In this
later period, pronounced variability in mortality rates is less striking across time and
more striking in the group differences in
risk of death.

As this shift in the pattern of variability
has occurred, the frame of reference for
examining mortality has required new criteria of social valuation which would permit distinctions as to which differences, or
changes in differences, are important and

 

 

which are not (Taeuber, 1968, p. 132).
The mortality literature has been slow to
respond to this need.

Suppose we are concerned with comparing two populations for current mortality
experience. If the comparison is made with
an eye to a purely demographic concern
for survivorship, then deaths may be related to populations at risk and adjusted
for differences in age, sex composition, or
other selected characteristics thought to
obscure the comparison. However, if the
mortality experience for comprehensive
survivorship is of less interest than the
impact of mortality on subject populations
in relation to its effect upon the long-run
social and economic wellbeing of the population, then the standard procedures are
less useful. Trends in the age-adjusted
mortality differentials by race are less
telling than those which describe changing
costs of mortality in the lifeways of the
populations; mortality in the economically
active components of the population, for
instance, may be a more useful target than
mortality at ages which account for most
deaths. The significance of this proposition
is suggested in Figure 1. As is seen in the

graph of the frequency of deaths by age,
these vital events are heavily concentrated
outside the working ages, but differently
for whites and nonwhites.

In this paper, I should like to explore
mortality and morbidity in the black population by comparison with the nonblack
(actually, white) population. But I propose to carry forth this examination in the
context of a concern for the manifest social
and economic inequalities in the society
which are such that black men and women
are at a clear disadvantage (Drake, 1966;
Duncan, 1967; U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1970). Thus, the problem of the measurement of mortality is complicated to the
extent to which it is necessary to weight
some deaths more than others. Other
complications arise in the need to focus
upon white-black differences in mortality
which comprise major components in the
mortality experience of significance in the
framework of social and economic inequalities of blacks; by the same token, some
large relative black-white differences must
be accorded less emphasis. The corre
sponding analysis in the case of morbidity
statistics is impeded by other obstacles.
Data on morbidity are less often available
for the population by race than data on
mortality. Moreover, those data which are
available are not readily interpreted, especially in any attempt to combine both
mortality and morbidity into a single index
(U.S. Public Health Service, 1966; Moriyama, 1968).

SOCIAL DIFFERENTIALS
IN MORTALITY

The analysis of morbidity and mortality
has historically focused heavily upon biomedical conditions in the interests of
searching out relevant determinants. Today, however, the social and economic conditions which prevail in the instances of
illness and death are of growing significance
in the United States. The reason is found
in the perceived relatively low level of
mortality which has been attained here.
The seemingly irresistable and immutable
processes of aging which are the deserves
of all who survive to later life stand on

one side while on the other the genetic
defects and accidents contributing to the
losses among the very young as well as the
middle-aged now loom large (Moriyama,
1968, p. 577). So there remain fields of
battle for medicine.

But more striking now are the differential patterns of morbidity and death which
afflict the population not through medical
ignorance but rather through our ignorance
of the differences in the way the social
order impinges on different human groupings. Medicine and social welfare concerns
join hands here in calling for further explication of these differences.

Differential mortality is hardly a new
field of study. Many works in the literature
for hundreds of years attest to this. However, the progress of understanding differences from a social and economic
standpoint appears less well-advanced. And
more importantly, the condition of certain
population aggregates remains particularly
obscure because the study of differentials
themselves do not necessarily depict the
social and cultural conditions which may
accompany the lifeways of specific subpopulations. As examples of subpopulations,
one may consider persons in poverty and
persons who are black, Mexican-American,
or American Indian in the United States.

Evidence to the support of the argument
of slow progress in developing social and
economic insights is found in the paucity
of adequate statistical material for such
disadvantaged subpopulations on a national
basis. For the Spanish-descent population,
as an example, no national data were available until 1969. For all such groups, uncertainty attends the adequacy of data
which are available. Both census and vital
data are plagued with under-reporting or
misreporting of characteristics and events
for such groups (Demeny and Gingrich,
1967; Farley, 1968; Kitagawa, 1968). The
comparability of data among such groups,

Mortality and Morbidity of Blacks

371

and even within groups across time, is
hazardous. Measures of mortality of American Indians have again only recently been
subject to question as the 1960 census
appears to have generated an unusual
affinity of persons to this population when
compared with earlier censuses (U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1963,
p. 1-15). Census undercounts among socalled hard-to-enumerate areas have been
of concern to demographers for some years
and have recently become notorious as the
more militant black population has looked
for evidence of racialism in a new and vital
perspective.

As we address the problems of disease,
disability, and loss of life among those in
poverty, another barrier to understanding
arises in the absence of a widely agreed
upon and analytically adequate definition
of poverty. As interest in poverty developed in the early part of the last decade,
an economic definition of poverty was conceived which could be rationalized by determining income levels corresponding to
costs of a marginal diet and by describing
the relationship between food costs and
other expenses (Orshansky, 1965). This
definition does not, however, deal with the
institutional population. More importantly,
perhaps, it does not throw light on the
relationship between illness and poverty as
to the direction of causation. For these
reasons, findings which show higher risks
of death or higher morbidity rates among
the poor are difficult to interpret. Does
poverty provide the milieu for reduced life
chances, or is poverty a state frequently
attained in the short run by the failure of
disabled persons, say in the year prior to
death, to sustain gainful employment, and
thus nonpoverty status (Kitagawa, 1969,
p. 14)?

In many respects, the relationship between health and poverty is poorly understood. Although it might be conjectured
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:32 08 December 2015

372

that a strong negative relationship exists
between the extent of poverty and the
extent of health and wellbeing, statistical
evidence on this point is not consistently
in support of this contention (Lefcowitz,
1970; U.S. National Center for Health
Statistics, 1970; U.S. Public Health Service, 1967, 1969a, 19695). At the same
time, there are specific relationships in
which poverty status shows more evidence
of morbidity and higher risks of mortality.
Certain ethnic and racial groups show
similar evidence of ill health which in part
is associated with socioeconomic status and
attendant health differentials, but which is
also in part associated with biological and
social conditions which affect the members
of these ethnic groups (Fuchs, 1965;
Goldstein, 1963; Kadushin, 1964). Studies
of poverty and race on other than health
matters have shown, for example, relationships with socioeconomic background on
the one hand, and discrimination on another, as partly independent antecedents in
affecting current status (Duncan, 1969).

MORTALITY AND
DISADVANTAGED STATUS

That differentials exist as to the force of
mortality according to social status has
long been recognized (Antonovsky, 1967).
For much of this time, up until quite
recently, these differentials were accepted
as inevitable, as inevitable as poverty
itself. Although comprehensive studies of
occupational differentials date back at least
to the turn of this century (U.S. Public
Health Service, 1962, p. 52-55), the apparent focus of concern in such studies has
been more often with occupational hazards
rather than with those associated with
class and status differences.

Unusual difficulties attend the analysis
of mortality by socioeconomic status. Since
death tends to occur in disproportion

 

Sutton

Social Biology

among those who have retired from the
labor force and since information provided
on death records comes from persons other
than the decedent, simple inquiries as to
occupation are not thought to yield data
of adequate quality for routine presentation and analysis (Lunde and Grove, 1966,
p. 569). Obstacles attending occupational
coding have led to its elimination in the
preparation of machine-readable records,
further obstructing the analysis of such
data. These and other obstacles which
relate to the interpretation of data on occupation in mortality studies have been
described by Guralnick (U.S. Public
Health Service, 1962, p. 51~52).

Mortality records in the past have not
contained information on educational attainment or on family income. These data,
particularly data about schooling, are
thought to have important advantages regarding problems of interpretation of occupational data. However, recent additions
to the standard certificate of death have
not included inquiries concerning educational attainment of the decedent (Lunde
and Grove, 1966, p. 571).

By far the most significant study in
recent years designed to overcome many
of these problems has been conducted by
Kitagawa and Hauser (1962). This study
is based upon a sample of records of
deaths in 1960 matched against corresponding 1960 census records, thus bringing
a wealth of information concerning population characteristics from persons who were
still alive at the time of the census (Kitagawa and Hauser, 1962). It is from this
study of some 62,400 decedents whose
death records were successfully matched
with 25% sample census records (since it
is the sample census which contained the
needed social and economic characteristics)
that much of the following discussion of
mortality dealing with race and with social
and economic status is based.

RACE AND MORTALITY

We are concerned with the relationship
between measures of health and with poverty and associated conditions of disadvantage. Two racial groups—there are more
but data are not readily available—clearly
exhibit disadvantaged status in the aggregate and can be examined as to their
mortality experience. These are the blacks
and the American Indians. Moreover, it is
also instructive to examine data by color
for the United States, since 9 in 10 in the
nonwhite population are black and since
there is a richer collection of statistics
available for white-nonwhite comparison
than there is for the comparison of Negro
and white. But since some nonwhites fare
better as a group than whites—for example, the Japanese and Chinese in view

ing population distributions by family
income—this category does not identify
the clearly disadvantaged groups as sharply
as do specific racial categories.

Table 1 presents death rates by sex, age,
and color for selected decades since the
turn of the century. Persistent differentials
in survivorship favoring whites are seen to
prevail over this period, except at ages 75
and over. Farley’s discussion (1970) of
trends in mortality and health conditions
among blacks in the twentieth century
points up two significant phenomena. First,
the improvements in life chances and in
income in the black population are dramatic in a relatively short period of time,
from the decade of the Depression up to
1955. Second, there has been little improvement in mortality since 1955, although a

significant drop in infant mortality is present (Farley, 1970, p. 58~75).

Death rates by race over three decades
are presented in Table 2. Although black
rates show markedly higher mortality risks
than those of the white population, the
rates for American Indians are lower.

Age-specific rates and numbers of associated deaths are shown in Table 3. As
might be expected, the crude rates are importantly affected by differences in their
respective age distributions. Thus, the
death rates for American Indians which
fall below those of the white population, as
well as the only marginally larger death
rates among blacks, tend to hide important
differences found when age-specific comparisons are made. These statistics are not
corrected for errors associated with data
collection, either those in death registration
or those in census enumeration.

The 1960 death record-census record
match study provides age-adjusted data
which, for nonwhites standing in for blacks,
are modified to reflect, alternatively, census
undercounts and age misstatements in
death record and census record discrepancies (Kitagawa, 1968). Comparing the uses
of the two resultant series of mortality
rates, Kitagawa has expressed preference
for those which are corrected for underenumeration. Census undercounts, she convincingly argues, are of much greater
consequence than apparent age misstatement, at least for ages under, say, 75
(Kitagawa, 1968, p. 8). Given the emphasis here on mortality experiences in the
younger and middle age ranges, that choice
is of direct utility in the present review.

Age-adjusted mortality among  nonwhites exceeds that among whites with
corrections for underenumeration (but not
age misstatement) by 20% for males and
34% for females.! Age-specific differentials
are large at most ages, but are most pronounced in the 25-64 age range, then
sharply falling and reversing after age 75.
As Kitagawa notes, the differentials are
greatest at the ages in which the force of
mortality is lowest, so that the reduced
and inverted differentials at the older ages
succeed, in net effect, in reducing the impact over all ages (Kitagawa, 1968, Table
3). The consequences of changing the basis
of comparison is seen in Table 4.

In the analysis of social and economic
factors affecting mortality, mortality experience at the working ages (i.e., at ages
associated with low mortality risks) is of
considerable importance. Mortality among

Mortality, morbidity, and poverty are
apparently linked in such a way that it is
possible to suggest, and not be far wrong,
that ill-health and high mortality risks are
inversely related to measures of individual
or family income and affluence. In attempting to understand this nexus, it is
especially important to give only secondary
attention to mortality in exactly those ages
which account most heavily for the attrition of successive generations of man. This
is because of the nature of the relationship
of sustenance and survival, and hence of
the relationship of economic and social

security to one’s ties to the labor force and
to gainful employment.

Thus, high mortality rates among the
elderly might reduce somewhat the burden
of survival upon families in and near conditions of poverty. Central questions within
this framework become: (1) What are the
chances of survival through the working
years of those who attain maturity where
concern is with the returns to the black
segment of society following the investment
in the raising of the child? (2) Viewing
the experiences of the newborn and those
in subsequent ages prior to the ages of
labor force entry, what is the capacity of
the population to sustain the effective
force of population replacement at the
working ages?

The lesser interest in the differentials
among the aged is also encouraged by difficulties encountered in interpreting data
for Negroes at the older ages. Age misreporting is certainly an important factor but
it is not, according to Kitagawa (personal
communication), possible to clearly establish whether the reversal in differentials at
the very older ages is attributable to problems with the data or whether some other
process is at work. On the other hand,
Thornton and Nam (1968) have made a
case for differential selection of a Darwinist
order which accounts for the relatively
high survival potential of many nonwhites
at the older ages?

No official life tables exist for the black
population. Separate tables have been prepared for whites and nonwhites, however
(U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, 1964). Using these tables, another
way of looking at differences by color in
mortality for the working ages is to compare survivorship values. This was done by
determining the relative loss in the life

white population in 1960, 32% of the
survivors to age 20 do not survive to age
65, whereas the corresponding figure for
nonwhites is 45%.

MORTALITY AMONG BLACKS

Kitagawa (1968) has also reported that
blacks had the highest mortality among
racial groups for which national data are
published—whites, American Indian, Japanese, Chinese, and other races. Her comparisons among races do not reflect
corrections for under-enumeration since
such calculations are not available by race.
The black mortality indexes for population
5 years old and over are 28% higher than
whites for males and 47% higher than
whites for females (Kitagawa, 1968, p. 13).
For American Indians, by contrast, the
levels are 24% and 37% above those
for white males and females, respectively.

Narrowing to our main interest in those
in the age range of 35 to 64 years, Kitagawa provides the following age-adjusted
differentials (per cent by which each index
exceeds that for whites of the corresponding sex):

Male Female
Negro 66 145

INFANT AND CHILDHOOD
MORTALITY AND RACE

Race differentials have been presented
by Kitagawa (1968) which bear on mortality of the population under 5 years of
age and on infant mortality (see Table 5).
We know that in the 1950’s, a leveling-off
in the long-term decline in infant mortality
occurred in the United States. That the
leveling occurred before infant mortality
rates were reduced to the levels found in a
number of other countries has caused students of this phenomenon to refuse to
consider the then existing levels as approaching an irreducible minimum (Mori

yama, 1968, p. 573~575). Shapiro, Schlesinger, and Nesbitt (1968, p. 10) have also
reported that since 1950, this reduction in
the rate of decline of this mortality measure was much more pronounced for
nonwhites:

Between 1953 and 1951 substantial de
creases in mortality in the first day of life

were scored by the white group; among nonwhite infants the decrease in the rate of loss
under 1 day stopped in 1943. More recently

—since 1952—the rate of increase in mor
tality at this age has been greater for the

nonwhite than the white infants.

A shift in the timing of loss of life and
wastage from the prenatal to the postnatal
period is one possible explanation. A contention that these changes might be attributable to problems in the reliability of
data for nonwhites is not thought to be
warranted because similar patterns have
been reported for nonwhites in areas known
to have long approached adequate levels
of reporting as to completeness and accuracy (Shapiro, Schlesinger, and Nesbitt,
1968, p. IL).

Geographic variations in infant mortality rates permit the generalization that
an area with a comparatively low rate
among white infants will have a low rate
among nonwhite infants; similarly this
relationship between color groups holds for
rates in the higher ranges. Infant mortality
rates among white population have been
higher in urban than in rural areas since

the early 1950’s. In contrast, nonwhite
rates, at least since the late 1940’s have
been higher in rural areas. But the more
notable relationship between color groups
in the context of geographic variability
“is that infant mortality is far greater
everywhere among nonwhite children”
(Shapiro, Schlesinger, and Nesbitt, 1968,
p. 35).

MORBIDITY AND RACE

Considerable difficulty is encountered in
contrasting populations as to morbidity
experience given the diversity of diseases,
injuries, and other pathological states which
afflict man. A simplifying assumption in
dealing with morbidity is taken when the
focus of the analysis is on the social and
economic consequences of such ill health
and disability rather than on morbidity
itself. Several appropriate measures of the
consequences of morbidity have been developed for the population of the United
States at the National Center for Health
Statistics.

Table 6 presents standardized morbidity
ratios for three such measures by color
and income for population under age 65
(U.S. Public Health Service, 1967, p. 3
and 8). These ratios relate actual morbidity to that expected when the effects of
sex, age, and farm-nonfarm residence are
removed. Thus, for acute conditions, the
white population in families with less than

* Standardized morbidity ratio is the ratio of actual to
expected events adjusted for age, sex, and farm-nonfarm
residence.

$3,000 has a standardized morbidity ratio
(SMR) of 103, indicating a level some
3% higher than the total population controlling for the effects of sex, age, and
farm-nonfarm residence; the corresponding SMR for nonwhites is 79, indicating
a level substantially lower than the norm
for the prevalence of acute conditions.
As can be seen in the table, nonwhites
have the advantage over whites as to acute
conditions, family income (using a twoway break at the $3,000 line) making
little difference in either color group. By
contrast, SMR’s for hospital days and
bed days are importantly affected by differences in family income, although color
differences are comparatively minor.
Chronic illness which limits a person’s
major activity—for persons aged 45 to 64
years—afflicts some 12% of the total population as can be seen in Table 7 (US.
Public Health Service, 1967, p. 6). However, such affliction is much more common
among those in the lower income classes
than those with moderate or high income.

tion of the middle-aged ‘poor’ population
suffer serious physical limitations in their
ability to work” (U.S. Public Health Services, 1967, p. 6). Given this observation,
the data in the three left-hand columns
of Table 8 provide a pattern regarding
activity restriction that is similar to that
found for hospital days and bed days:
color differences are relatively minor when
compared with those associated with income
differences. Table 8 shows, in addition, for
both activity restriction measures and for
bed days, for both white and nonwhite, a
monotonic decline with increasing income
over the more detailed income categories
(U.S. Public Health Service, 1967, p. 2325).

Using a somewhat different approach,
Bauer (US. Public Health Service, 1969a)
has described the population by color and
income according to numbers of disability
days per person. These data, which unfortunately include persons 65 years of
age and over, show results similar to those
of Guralnick (U.S. Public Health Service,
1967) that color differences are on the
whole not dramatic (Table 9). Moreover,
even when the relatively large color differences in work loss of females in the “less
than $3,000” family income class are
considered in the context of the work
year—say of 50 five-day weeks—the impact seems small. A work loss of 6.3 days
for white and 7.8 days for nonwhite is a
difference of some 24%; but this difference

differences in health characteristics were
related more to socioeconomic factors of
the two population groups than to color.”

DISCUSSION

The problem addressed by Sullivan
(U.S. Public Health Service, 1966) in his
study of the integration of mortality and
morbidity experience into a health index
takes on a somewhat different aspect when
consideration of social and economic welfare are introduced to constrain the definition of the problem. For example, the
classic approach to the dependency ratio,
expressing the proportion of the population
in the “dependent” ages to that in the
working ages is, in cross-section in time,
concerned with the implications of demographic processes for population survival
and for productive potential in the population.

A somewhat more attractive approach,
suggested by Dublin and Lotka (1946)
and more recently elaborated upon by
Miller (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1966,
p. 135) and by Spiegelman (1968, p. 382385) considers the “money value of a man.”
In this approach, both cross-section income

ing lifetime can be considered, but, in addition, changes in the earnings experiences
of birth cohorts in the working ages over
intercensal periods can be assessed.

Suppose we adopt such an approach.
By carrying forth the contrast of earnings
of the population aged 25 to 34 at the
time of the census with the population
aged 35-44 at the next, we might attempt
to deal with the losses to earnings associated with morbidity experience and mortality, thereby explicating the consequences
of health differentials in terms which make
understandable movements toward social
welfare objectives. Health measures are not
unambiguous; some means of translating
these for the appraisal which can distinguish between one kind of health benefit
and another must be accomplished if any
intelligible discussion of progressive health
trends is to occur.

ed). A quick perusal of this table provides,
convincing evidence that the effect of
mortality upon disabled persons has important consequences for data on morbidity since disabilities arising from serious
acute and chronic conditions are associated with loss of life which is sufficiently
large to affect the quality of reporting of
such morbid conditions.’ It has been shown
by Sirken (U.S. Public Health Service,
1965) that the loss of morbidity experience from survey data in groups with high
mortality risks—the aged, or, here, the
disabled Social Security beneficiaries—is
substantial.

Data from a 1966 survey of noninstitutionalized disabled adults is in part represented in Table 11 (Brehm, 1970, Table
2). It can be seen that the mortality experience of disabled persons shown in Table
10 roughly corresponds to the cell “disability beneficiaries” of which there were
nearly one million in 1966. Although disability definitions will vary (those with
major activity limitations aged 17 to 64
in 1968 was just under 10 million
{U.S. Public Health Service, 1970, Table
9]) it is reasonable for us to assume that
a much more sizeable population is sub

ject to mortality risks which are higher
than normal for corresponding sex and
age classes. Moreover, it should be clear
that Disability Insurance beneficiaries are
probably—in the context of our concern
for black and low-income groups—somewhat better-off than are many disabled
persons not covered by disability insurance. Those disabled persons who are receiving public assistance payments—1.268
million in 1966—may well even more severely feel the force of mortality than the
OASDHI beneficiaries. Thus, the interrelation of mortality and morbidity brings
us to propose that a crucial problem which
must be addressed is the integration of
these interdependent phenomena.

EFFECTS OF DEATH AND DISABILITY
UPON DEPENDENTS

An additional problem in the appraisal
of the survival conditions and the wellbeing of the black population in the United
States is found in attempting to ascertain
the effect of mortality and morbidity upon
family organization. The social costs of
such experiences, as in the case of direct
economic costs, are better appraised in a
family context where the realities of the
burden of disabled family members as well
as the social consequences of the economic
loss are found in the death or disability of
the breadwinner.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

A review of recent data concerning
morbidity and mortality differences between the white and black population is
presented to reflect upon the contribution
of these data to the relative well-being of
the black population. Crude death rates
and even age-adjusted mortality rates
obscure important mortality differences
between blacks and whites. These differences are found particularly at those ages
which are of most significance in considering the problem of the social welfare of
the population. The black-white differentials are greatest where they have the
greatest impact. Morbidity data do not
demonstrate such effects; however, it is
apparent that mortality and morbidity experiences are closely interdependent and

Sutton

Social Biology

that an integration of these effects, which
has not yet been successfully carried out,
would be of considerable utility.

Data currently published which are illustrated here do not lend themselves to
simple interpretation of black-white differences related to welfare implications. The
size of the mortality differential by race
in the working ages is more appropriate
to the concerns of the social welfare of
blacks as a population in the aggregate
than differentials taken more broadly as to
general mortality. Even so, once we have
established the relative level, the question
remains: What is the calculus of wellbeing such that it is possible to sort out
significant gains in the analysis of trends
in the well-being of blacks in the United
States?
