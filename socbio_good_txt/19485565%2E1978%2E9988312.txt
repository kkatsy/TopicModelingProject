ABSTRACT: Studies of adult same-sex twins which rely upon volunteer subjects typically consist of
about two-thirds female and two-thirds monozygotic (MZ) pairs. Because of this recruitment bias,
the male and dizygotic (DZ) twins in such studies will be less representative of their respective
populations and will show smaller between-pair variance on many traits than will the comparison
samples of female and MZ twins. This reduction in between-pair variance results in underestimation of the true intraclass correlation in the populations of DZ twins and in overestimation of the
true heritability of the trait under study. The only adequate solution to this problem may be to
provide sufficient extrinsic incentive (e.g., money payments) to overcome the strong recruitment

bias documented in this paper.

Studies of adult same-sex twins which
rely upon volunteer subjects will consist of
about two-thirds female and two-thirds
monozygotic (MZ) pairs. This “rule of
two-thirds” is illustrated in the eleven
studies summarized in Table 1, studies
done between 1928 and 1977 in Germany,
Canada, the Netherlands, Britain, and the
United States.! The only samples of volunteer twins known to us but not listed in
Table 1 are ones in which it seems apparent that male and/or dizygotic (DZ) pairs
were selectively recruited in an attempt to
equalize the groups.

Among same-sexed twin pairs who
survive the first year of life about 50 per
cent are male and SO per cent are female.
From 46 to 51 per cent of twins of each sex
will be MZ (Slater and Cowie, 1971, p.
346). Therefore, in the adult population,
one should expect to find about equal

1 In addition, Nichols and Bilbro (1966) recruited
123 same-sex pairs who agreed to provide blood
samples for zygosity diagnosis. The sex ratios are not
reported, but 82 (67 per cent) of the 123 pairs were
MZ twins.

numbers of male and female MZ and DZ
pairs. However, because of the two-thirds
rule, without selective recruiting one will
obtain MZ-F, DZ-F, MZ-M, DZ-M pairs
in the approximate proportions 4:2:2:1 instead of 1:1:1:1. If selective recruiting is
employed, one must approach four times
as many potential DZ-M pairs as MZ-F
pairs in order to obtain groups of equal
size.

We assume that there is always some
resistance to participation as a research
subject, based on such considerations as
the time, effort, and inconvenience involved plus idiosyncratic factors such as
shyness, concern about invasion of privacy, and the like. To be successfully recruited, a subject must have sufficient incentive to overcome his/her individual resistance. Incentive to participate may be
intrinsic, based on an interest in the topic
of investigation, a desire to aid scientific
research or a general enthusiasm for new
experience, or extrinsic, as generated by
the offer of money payments or by insistent recruiting pressure.

marized recently by Rosenthal and Rosnow (1975) make it plain that the volunteer subject differs in numerous respects
from the non-volunteer. One effect in respect to twin research is that volunteer DZ
samples must be expected to be more
homogeneous, to show less total variance, than the MZ samples with whom
they are to be compared. If the within-pair
DZ variance is relatively fixed, the
between-pair variance will decrease in
proportion to total variance for the DZ
sample. Therefore, such restriction in the
range of total variation will selectively diminish intraclass correlations computed to
represent the within-pair similarity of the
DZ twins and thus will artificially inflate
estimates of broad heritability based on
MZ:DZ comparisons. We shall illustrate
this reduction in total variance for DZ
twins in a variety of traits in the next
section. First, however, it is appropriate
to outline the salient facts about the volunteer subject and the problems of recruitment bias which have been established in
research with singletons.

As Rosenthal and Rosnow (1975) have
documented, females are more likely than
males to volunteer as experimental subjects unless the research promises to be
stressful. No explanation for this sex difference seems to be available. Volunteers
also tend to be more intelligent, better
educated, and to have higher social class
status than nonvolunteers. The interests
and values which conduce toward taking
tests and other activities of research participation are more common among
women than men and more frequent
among intelligent, middle-class, bettereducated persons. MZ twins as a group
are more interested in twinship as a phenomenon and more likely to do things in
concert than are DZ twins. Rosenthal and
Rosnow list as one of their “conclusions
warranting maximum confidence” the
obvious and well-documented proposition

 

Volunteer Bias in Twin Research 3

that “Persons more interested in the topic
under investigation are more likely to volunteer” (1975, p. 197). When the persons
are twins and the topic has to do with
twins, MZ pairs might be said to be nearly
twice as interested, on the average, as are
DZ pairs.

The proportion of females to males and
of MZ to DZ twins can be moved above
and below the average of about two-thirds
by manipulating the demands made on the
subjects and the incentives offered to
them. In one mailing to most of the samesex twins in Minnesota who were highschool Seniors at the time, of the twins
who returned a simple one-page questionnaire 63 per cent were female and 60 per
cent MZ. Those who also completed a
lengthy personality inventory were 72 per
cent female and 70 per cent MZ (Lykken
and Tellegen, unpublished data; see Table
1, No. 5). Increasing task demand without
commensurate increase in incentive yields
greater attrition among the less interested
males and DZ pairs and thus greater recruitment bias. Young adult twins in the
Minneapolis-St. Paul area were recruited
for much more extensive laboratory studies. To compensate for greater task demand, incentive was increased by telephone follow-up and by monetary reward;
as a result, the proportion of male pairs
and of DZ pairs were both increased as
shown in Table 1, No. 6 (Lykken and
Tellegen, unpublished data). Extrinsic incentive can be said to be at a minimum
when subjects volunteer without solicitation. A story about the Minnesota Twin
Study in a national tabloid produced unsolicited letters from 83 twin pairs of
whom 87 per cent were female and 96 per
cent MZ.

The foregoing considerations suggest, in
consequence of the rule of two-thirds, that
in volunteer twin samples MZ pairs, particularly MZ females, should be more representative of their respective populations,

4 Lykken et al.

than DZ pairs. Therefore, DZ pairs, especially DZ males, should show less total
variability than do MZ pairs (or than do
random pairs of unrelated subjects) on any
traits possibly related to the tendency to
volunteer as research subjects. We have
administered Tellegen’s Differential Personality Questionnaire (DPQ) to 337
same-sex twin-pair volunteers, including
152 MZ female, 72 DZ female, 79 MZ
male, and 34 DZ male pairs. The DPQ
consists of 300 items yielding scores on 11
relatively independent scales each of
which has high internal consistency and
high test-retest reliability in normal subjects (Tellegen, unpublished).

The DPQ scale means and total variances for our volunteer MZ and DZ
groups are compared in Table 2. The DPQ
Social closeness, Social potency and Impulsiveness scales represent three nearly
orthogonal dimensions which are often
subsumed under the conventional Extraversion concept. The Stress reaction
scale measures the Neuroticism variable
with high reliability but, at the same time,
with considerable breadth of item content.
Table 2 also contains data on five anthropometric variables, fingerprint ridge
count, height, weight, ponderal index,
and birth weight. Any trait that is related
to the tendency to volunteer might show a
difference between the MZ and DZ
means. In the following paragraphs we
will offer tentative interpretations of some
of the differences found; but we emphasize
that our present concern is to illustrate
recruitment bias rather than to reach substantive conclusions about the particular
variables studied here.

To begin with, DZ females score reliably higher on the Danger seeking scale
than do the MZ females. But it would bea
mistake to conclude that fraternal twins

2 The ponderal index, obtained by dividing height
by the cube root of weight, is a measure of leaness.

 

 

Social Biology

therefore are more venturesome than
identicals. All that these data show is that
these DZ volunteers, who represent about
40 per cent of the DZ female pairs invited
to participate, were more venturesome
than the MZ volunteers, who represent
about 80 per cent of those invited. Since
we can assume that the MZ twins had
more intrinsic interest in participating, it
seems likely that the more timid of the DZ
females were selectively omitted from our
volunteer sample.

In regard to height, Wilson (1974) found
no significant differences in height between four-year-old MZ and DZ pairs recruited in infancy (so that no recruitment
bias in our sense could have been operating). If these trends persist into adulthood,
then the fact that, for both sexes, our adult
DZ volunteers are about one inch taller
than the MZ twins may indicate a tendency for the shorter DZ twins to avoid
participation.

One way to test these speculations, of
course, would be to provide to all subjects
a monetary incentive sufficient to outweigh the intrinsic incentive differential
which favors MZ’s over DZ’s and females
over males. We would then expect to find
about equal means and variances for MZ’s
and DZ’s on most of the variables listed in
Table 2. We think the MZ females might
still be higher on Social closeness, however, due not to an excess of high scores
but to a paucity of low scores in the MZ
sample. The total variance on Social
closeness for the DZ females is equal to
that for the norm group and significantly
higher than the MZ total variance, which
suggests that the DZ volunteers are not
selected on this trait and that MZ females
truly include fewer “loners” than are
found among female DZ’s or singletons.

Among males, MZ and especially DZ
volunteers score significantly higher than
the norm group on Social closeness, and
the DZ variance is reliably less than that

for the MZ sample. Again we might conclude that having an MZ twin seems to
preclude really low Social closeness
scores. But it appears that for male DZ’s a
real sampling bias seems to operate with
respect to this trait, with 81 per cent of our
volunteers scoring above the norm group
mean. This sample is the most selected of
all, representing only about 20 per cent of
all the DZ male pairs whose participation
was solicited. With such weak intrinsic
motivation it appears that either member
of a male DZ pair having a “loner” disposition serves to exclude that pair from
appearing in the sample.

Another curious sex difference has to do
with Impulsiveness on which only 25 per
cent of the DZ males scored above the
norm group mean. In the case of DZ females, the more impulsive individuals
were more likely to participate; but for the
males, perhaps because their intrinsic
motivation is so low to begin with, it appears that the more impulsive individuals
were selected against. It is as if among DZ
females the more impulsive said, “Let’s do
it!”, while among DZ males the more impulsive threw away the invitation.

The most striking feature of Table 2 is
the tendency for the MZ and DZ volunteers to differ in total variance, often
without a corresponding difference in
mean score. Thus, the MZ and DZ females do not differ significantly in mean
weight or in ponderal index, and yet the
DZ variance is only about 60 per cent of
the MZ total variance, a highly reliable
difference. Inspection of the distributions
shows that both extremes are missing from
the DZ sample, that DZ pairs in which
one or both members are either very heavy
(either large or obese) or very light (either
small or thin) do not volunteer. This was
less true for DZ males, possibly because
they are less self-conscious about their
physical appearance than are young adult
females. MZ females are more interested

Social Biology

in participation in a twin study, sufficiently so to overcome their shyness;
and also, the fact that the co-twin will
tend to be equally deviant in size may
diminish self-consciousness. In respect to
personality variables, it is the male DZ’s
who are most selected, their total variance
being smaller than for MZ males for 10 of
the 11 DPQ scales and _ significantly
smaller for 4. Since it would be hard to
see how fingerprint ridge count might
influence the tendency to volunteer, it is
reassuring to note that the DZ samples are
not significantly more homogeneous on
this variable than are the MZ groups.

It is well established that volunteers
tend to be more intelligent than nonvolunteers (Rosenthal and Rosnow, 1975). We
have scores for about one-fourth of our
twin sample on the Millhill Vocabulary
Test and on the Raven Progressive Matrices. Reflecting the rule of two-thirds, the
group of male DZ’s was too small to provide reliable data. For the females, the DZ
total variance was smaller than the MZ
variance on both intelligence measures,
and reliably smaller for the Raven Matrices. This reduced DZ variance is due toa
relative absence of low scores; the upper
quartiles of the MZ and DZ distributions
are about equal. The MZ intraclass correlations were 0.72 and 0.82 for the Raven
and Millhill, respectively. The DZ correlations were 0.14 and 0.40 giving estimates of broad heritability of 1.16 (Raven)
and 0.82 (Millhill). Had the DZ total variances equaled those found for the MZ volunteers, the DZ correlations would have
increased from 0.14 to 0.42 and from 0.40
to 0.49. The heritability estimates then
would be 0.60 (Raven) and 0.66 (Millhill).

The fact that selection bias resulting
from the rule of two-thirds tends to reduce
the total variance of DZ twin samples ona
wide variety of trait measures is important, as this example shows, because estimates of broad heritability from twin data

Vol. 25, No. 1

are based upon a comparison of intraclass
correlations which, in turn, assumes that
the total variances are the same for both
types of twin. While it is possible that
selection bias may influence within-pair
variance, e.g., that DZ pairs who differ
widely on certain traits may therefore be
less likely to volunteer, to demonstrate
such an effect would require testing volunteers and then recruiting all those who
failed to volunteer in the first phase, using
sufficient monetary inducement, and
comparing the two sets of scores. Our present data can make a strong case only for
selection bias affecting between-pair variance. Since the intraclass correlation
equals the difference of the between- and
the within-pair mean squares, divided by
their sum, reduction in between-pair variance will result in underestimation of the
true intraclass correlation for the reference
DZ population and in overestimation of
the heritability of the trait in question.
The intraclass correlations computed

Volunteer Bias in Twin Research a

for the variables of Table 2 are shown in
Table 3. For both MZ and DZ samples,
“corrected” correlations are also listed. We
obtained these values by assuming that the
true total variance for both twin types
equals the variance of the appropriate
norm group for each trait. This assumption 1s probably invalid for some variables, but it permits a correction which at
least does not selectively favor either twin
type. A “corrected” between-pair mean
square is obtained by subtracting the
within-pair mean square from twice the
norm group variance, and a new estimate
of the intraclass correlation is then computed. With respect to the anthropometric
variables, one would expect the DZ correlation to be somewhat larger than half the
MZ value. Excluding birth weight, 5 of
the 8 DZ correlations are too low in this
sense, whereas 6 of the 8 fall in line with
expectation after correction for MZ:DZ
differences in total variance. Birth weight
is a special case, since within-pair similar

ity for both types of twins is primarily
determined by their similar gestation
length which in turn results from those
“environmental” factors which normally
cause both twins to be delivered in the
same period of labor.

Turning next to the 11 personality variables, 8 of the DZ correlations are significantly smaller than the corresponding
MZ correlations for males. While some of
these traits may well have a considerable
component of genetic variance, Well being, which has a substantial mood or state
component, and Authoritarianism, which
is a social attitude variable, might be expected to show comparatively small differences. After correction for attenuation
of DZ total variance, only 4 of the 11 traits
show a significant MZ:DZ difference for
the males. The same correction reduces
the number of significant MZ:DZ differences for females from 9 to 4. Peculiarities
remain in the data of Table 3 even after
correction for attenuation in total variance
of the DZ volunteer samples. For example, for the male twins, the intraclass correlations for DZ’s are negative on Aggression and about zero on Impulsiveness, as
compared with MZ correlations of 0.54
and 0.57. A plausible explanation is that a
mechanism of complementariness is operating here. Assuming some genetic variance
in both traits, the naturally less aggressive
brother in a DZ pair learns to be less aggressive than his genes might have dic
Social Biology

tated through his association with his
brother who, in turn, may cultivate his
natural aggressiveness more than he
would have in the absence of his less aggressive twin. Our purpose, however, is
not to rationalize these data in all respects,
but rather to demonstrate the very substantial changes in the data which result
from the sampling bias which attenuates
the variance of a wide variety of traits in
samples of DZ twin volunteers.

Although we believe that our method of
estimating “corrected” intraclass correlations may be useful for exploratory data
analysis, we do not advocate it as more
than a provisional solution to the problem
of recruitment bias. A better solution
would seem to be to provide sufficient extrinsic incentive (e.g., money payments) in
studies of twin volunteers so as to override
the inevitable differences in intrinsic
motivation which lead to the common
finding that two of every three volunteer
pairs are female and two of every three are
MZ. The simple test of the adequacy of
such extrinsic motivation is whether,
when recruiting from populations of equal
size, one obtains MZ-M, DZ-M, MZ-F,
and DZ-F volunteers in about equal proportions.
