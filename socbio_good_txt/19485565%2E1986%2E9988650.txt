Comment on “Toward a Reformulation of the
Neonatal Mortality Rate’? by Dudley L. Poston and

The article recently published in Social Biology (Vol. 32[1-2]:1-12) by Poston and Rogers illustrates empirically
that neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates, as currently defined, are inadequate proxies for endogenous and exogeneous mortality respectively. I
would like to press this point even further on a theoretical level. Owing to major advances in neonatal intensive care
technology and to increased knowledge
of the etiology of pre-term birth and low
birth weight (two frequent precursors of
infant, and especially neonatal, death),
the reason given by Poston and Rogers
for the endogeneous/exogeneous distinction itself, that ‘‘deaths arising from
jendogeneous} causes are those over
which ‘even the best health services
have comparatively little control’
(Thompson and Lewis, 1965, p. 356)”
(p. 1) must be reexamined. It has been
demonstrated, for instance, that birth at

tertiary centers (hospitals with neonatal
intensive care units) can avert infant
deaths among 1,000 to 1,500 gram infants and, to a less pronounced degree,
even among infants weighing only 750 to
1,000 grams at birth (Gortmaker et al.,
1985).

Furthermore, several suspected
causes of prematurity and low birth
weight such as maternal gentourinary
tract infections, hypertension, malnutrition, smoking, and alcohol and narcotic
abuse could be either eradicated, controlled, or at least monitored during the
prenatal period (and before) with appropriate clinical, educational, and social intervention.

As definitions currently stand, the effects of these types of factors, while not
genetic or in some other sense inherent,
unavoidable, or unalterable by appropriate health service delivery are considered implicitly to be ‘‘endogeneous”

causes of infant death. Some of the very
same factors, such as infection or colonization by microorganisms, when occurring after birth, are called “‘exogeneous’? causes of death. Whether
occurring to the mother, and through
her to the fetus before birth, or occurring directly to the baby after birth,
many causes of infant death are environmental and theoretically modifiable.

The crucial question may not be should
we define neonatal death as death occurring by day 18 or by day 28, but
should we not just reformulate but also
reconceptualize the definition of neonatal mortality; and then, how do we muster our knowledge and resources to
avert the many infant deaths over
which, in some sense, we could exercise
control?

Comments on the Conceptual Treatment of Neonatal

Mortality: Reply to Geronimus

We agree with many of Geronimus’
comments (1986) and welcome the opportunity to clarify our stance and to further the general conceptual treatment of
neonatal mortality. While our initial focus was empirical (Poston and Rogers,
1985) and Geronimus’ comment (1986)
is theoretical, we would like to extend
these ideas to a more practical level.

Because the focus of our paper was to
determine the accuracy of neonatal and
postneonatal mortality rates as proxies
of endogenous and exogenous causes of
death, we maintained the endogenous/
exogenous distinction. Our results suggest that endogenous and exogenous
mortality rates are more accurate and
impart more information than neonatal
