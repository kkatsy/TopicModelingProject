Intermarriage among Ethnic Groups

in the United States

Paul C. Glick

Bureau of the Census
Washington, D.C.

Information from the 1960 census throws
light on the extent of intermarriage among
persons of different ethnic groups. Here the
term “ethnic groups” is used to refer to
racial and national origin groups. An analysis of the census data tends to confirm the
impression that marriages generally occur
among persons of the same ethnic group.
However, there are important exceptions to
this general rule, and the magnitude of the
exceptions varies considerably. In the context of this situation where “‘like tends to
marry like,” this paper will show how much
ethnic group intermarriage occurs under
varying circumstances and will present
some interpretive comments which are suggested by the data.!

RACE OF HUSBAND AND WIFE

The first census tabulations of race of
husband by race of wife were made from
the 1960 census. That was the first decennial
census in which persons were offered the
opportunity to record their own race on
a self-enumeration form. This procedure

1 A somewhat different treatment of census data
on intermarriage among racial and national origin
groups is presented in Carter and Glick, 1970, p.
112-143. Other references to the voluminous literature on intermarriage include Heer, 1966; Bernard,
1966; and several hundred references in Aldous and
Hill, 1967.

 

greatly increased the likelihood of obtaining appropriate racial classifications as
compared with earlier censuses when the
enumerator was instructed to enter information about race by observation of the
household respondent. However, for the unknown proportion of persons whose race
was not recorded by self-enumeration, an
interviewer obtained the information on
race by observation during a visit to the
household.

According to the 1960 census, only
163,800 married couples, or fourth-tenths
of one per cent of the 40,491,000 married
couples in the United States, comprised a
husband and wife of different races. These
racially mixed marriages were distributed
as shown in Table 1.

Nearly one-third of the racial mixtures
consist of Negroes married to whites. Of
the 55,000 white men married to wives of
“other races,” 22,000 were married to
Japanese wives. Similarly, of the 5,000
Negro men married to wives of “other
races,” 2,000 were married to Japanese
wives. Almost all of the intermarriage involving husbands and wives of two different
“other races” related to persons of American
Indian, Oriental, or Polynesian origin.”

2 Persons of “other races” are subdivided by the
Bureau of the Census into several categories which

A very small proportion (less than one
per cent) of the white persons or Negroes
who entered their first marriage during the
1950’s married persons of a different race.
By sharp contrast, 38% of the Japanese
wives, 33% of the Filipino wives, and 24%
of the American Indian wives who first
married in the 1950’s were married to
husbands of a different race, usually white
men. Corresponding figures for men who
out-married were smaller for the Japanese
(9%) and American Indians (19%), but
reached 42% for Filipinos. About 18% of
the Chinese men and 14% of the Chinese
women who first married in the 1950’s did
not have a Chinese spouse. A large majority
of the Japanese and Filipino population of
the United States live in California or
Hawaii, and nearly half of the Chinese
live in California.

The substantial proportions of Japanese
and Filipino women who married men of a
different race during the 1950’s can probably
be accounted for to a large extent by marriages they contracted with military men

are not biologically distinct groups, but which have

d significance primarily in relation to earlier
settlement and immigration policies of the United
States. These categories include American Indian,
Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, and “‘All Other’? (Hawalian, Eskimo, Aleut, etc.).

from the United States. By way of comparison among married women in 1960 who had
entered marriage before 1940, only 8% of
the Japanese and 16% of the Filipinos had
married men of a different race.

Persons with racial intermarriages had
some noteworthy patterns of distribution
in regard to region of residence and educational level. These patterns were observed
among couples who had entered marriages
during the 1950’s involving a Negro married
to a white person, both married only once
at the time of the 1960 census. The numbers of such persons were small: 6,082
white husbands married to Negro wives and
7,534 Negro husbands married to white
wives (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1966,
Table 12). Although these numbers are
small, the corresponding figures at later
census dates will very likely be much larger.
Meanwhile, information from the 1970 census will update the 1960 data presented here
on the manner in which such marriages are
distributed.

Although the proportion Negro in the
total population in 1960 was more than three
times as large in the South as in the North
and West, the number of southern Negrowhite couples (reported as married for the
first time in the 1950’s) constituted only
0.16% of all southern couples (reported as
married in the 1950’s), very slightly larger
than the corresponding proportion in the
North and West (0.14%). Three out of
five of the couples with mixed marriages
in the South involved a white husband with
a Negro wife, whereas three out of five of
those in the North and West involved a
Negro husband with a white wife. Evidently, most of the interracial unions in the
South in 1960 were either based on common-law marriages or on marriages contracted outside the South, because marriages between Negroes and white persons
were not legal in the South at that time.

Persons who had intermarried also tended
to differ in respect to educational level from

294 Glick

those with unmixed marriages (U.S. Bureau
of the Census, 1966, Table 12). The selective process in Negro-white intermarriage
most often involved Negroes with more
education than those who had married another Negro and white persons with less
education than those who had married
another white person. In the context of
racial attitudes that still prevail among a
large proportion of the population in the
United States, this selective process in
marriage has been interpreted in terms of an
exchange theory, wherein the Negro tends
to offer a premium (more education) to
marry a white person.®

CURRENT FERTILITY RATES BY RACENATIVITY OF HUSBAND AND WIFE

Information from the 1960 census on the
fertility rates of women in racially mixed
and unmixed marriages is available only
in terms of the number of young children
who were living with their parents. These
rates are based on data from a 5% sample

This and other theories of mate selection are
discussed in Rodman, 1965, p. 43-72.

Social Biology

of women in 1960, Because of the small
number of racially mixed marriages, no
attempt was made to tabulate fertility
data for women in such marriages during
the 1960’s from the Current Population
Survey, which is based on a sample of less
than one-tenth of one per cent. Also, because Negro women are much more likely
than white women to have living children
who reside with someone else, these “fertility rates” tend to be understated for
Negroes by approximately 10% (USS.
Bureau of the Census, 1968, p. 5). The rates
shown in Table 2 have not been adjusted
for this deficiency. Such an adjustment
would have generally increased the whiteNegro differentials.

Data shown here for white women are
limited to native whites; the number of
foreign-born white women married to husbands of races other than white was too
small to show for any of the five-year age
groups. Foreign-born white women below
age 30 who were married to white men
tended to have lower fertility than comparable native white women, but at some

of the older ages within the reproductive
range the reverse was found.

White women had the lowest fertility in
almost all combinations of age of wife and
race of husband. This finding was most
consistent among women near the beginning
and end of the reproductive age range, where
fertility rates are usually low among groups
with low fertility for all ages combined.

Negro women married to Negro men had
especially high fertility rates before the
age of 25 years, whereas women of “other
races” married to men of “other races”
had relatively high fertility rates at older
ages. Among the factors underlying these
differentials are a pattern of early mating
among Negroes and a rather high average
age at marriage among persons of “other
races,”

Fertility rates among women in mixed
marriages tended to be lowest for whiteand-Negro mixtures; these rates were about
10% above the fertility rate for unmixed
white couples and 20% below the fertility
rate for unmixed Negro couples. In all
combinations of racial groups which included one spouse of “other races,” the
fertility rates ranged from moderately high
to very high. The highest fertility rate of
all was that for Women of “other races”
married to white men; this rate was 10%
above that for women of “other races”
married to men of “other races” and half
again as high as that for white women
married to white men. The high fertility
rate in 1960 for women of “other races”’ in
their early thirties who were married to
white men very likely reflects a tendency
toward large families among Japanese and
Filipino women who married white men
abroad after World War II.

The high ratios of children to women
among Negroes in their late thirties and
early forties may reflect, at least to a minor
extent, misreporting of grandchildren as
own children of the woman, especially

Ethnic Group Intermarriage 295

where a young mother has left her children
under the care of their grandmother while
she works at another location. The likelihood that such misreporting is minor is
supported by the fact that middle-aged
family heads in 1960 who were reported as
having grandchildren as household members
(rather than misreported as own children
in the household) constituted more than
twice as large a proportion among nonwhite
than white families (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1963, Table 18).

NATIONAL ORIGIN OF HUSBAND
AND WIFE

Most of the persons of first- or secondgeneration “foreign stock” in the United
States are white. About two-thirds of them
in 1960 had one of the following seven
countries as their national origin, as determined on the basis of their own or their
father’s country of birth (or mother’s
country of birth if father was native):
United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Germany, Poland, U.S.S.R., and Italy.

Tn 1960, of the 40,491,000 married couples
in the United States, 10,973,000 of the
husbands and 10,320,000 of the wives were
of foreign stock. Among those of foreign
stock about three out of eight married a
native person of native parentage, a similar
proportion married a person of foreign
stock with the same national origin, and
the remaining one-fourth married a person
of foreign stock with a different national
origin.

These facts provide evidence that the
amount of marriage outside one’s own national origin is rather extensive; yet a part
of those of first- or second-generation foreign
stock who married native persons of native
parentage undoubtedly had actually married persons of “third-generation or earlier
foreign stock”’ with the same national origin.
However, information on national origin
was not collected in the 1960 census for
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:54 08 December 2015

such an early generation. Moreover, since
the national origin of second-generation
Americans with both parents foreign born
was arbitrarily based on the country of
birth of the father, some of the out-marriages
made on this basis would have been counted
as in-marriages if national origin had been
based on the country of birth of the mother
or on the country of birth of either parent.

Sharp changes in the extent of out-marriage had occurred between the first and
second generation in America. Only 38% of
the first-generation husbands had out-married as compared with 61% of the secondgeneration husbands. An extreme group
was the Italians, of whom only one out of
five had out-married in the first generation,

Social Biology

whereas the corresponding figure for the
second generation exceeded one-half of all
marriages.

Persons of foreign stock with the United
Kingdom or Ireland as their national origin
were actually more likely to marry a person
with a different origin than one with their
own origin, as may be seen in Table 3. Outmarriage among these persons was heaviest
with persons from English-speaking countries or with Germans. Two-thirds or more
of the husbands or wives of foreign stock
with the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada,
or Germany as their national origin had
married a spouse with one of the same four
countries as their national origin.

one per cent) are for couples with national
origins that are generally quite different
for the husband and wife, in the sense that
immigrants from the countries involved
have substantial cultural differences especially with respect to language and religion. For example, combinations of spouses
with Ireland and U.S.S.R. as their origin
are very infrequent, presumably in large
part because a substantial majority of
Irishmen of first- or second-generation in
the United States are English-speaking
Catholics, whereas a substantial majority
of Americans with the U.S.S.R. as their
national origin are Jewish. About onetenth of those with Poland as their national
origin had married persons with the U.S.S.R.
as their origin; presumably most of these
couples were of Jewish cultural heritage.

The larger proportion of Italian women
matried to Italian men than of Italian
men married to Italian women undoubtedly reflects the relative shortage (about
50,000) of Italian women as compared with
Italian men among married persons of
foreign stock, On the other hand, the relative excess of Canadian and Polish women
has Jed to a smaller proportion of women
of these stocks who were married to men of
the same stock.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The evidence presented here from census
data on married couples demonstrates that
the measured amount of interracial marriage in the United States in 1960 was extremely small—only about four married
couples out of every one thousand—but
was very substantial among such narrowly
defined racial groups as Filipino men,
nearly half of whom had married women
who were not Filipinos. Negro-white married couples were selective of white persons

with a lower educational level than that of 
persons in white-white marriages; these
couples also were selective of Negroes with a
higher educational level than that of per

sons in Negro-Negro marriages. The fertility rates for women in Negro-white marriages were above that for women in whitewhite marriages and lower than that for
women in Negro-Negro marriages.

Married couples with at Jeast one spouse
of foreign stock (first- or second-generation
American) comprised more than one-third
of all couples in the United States in 1960.
A majority of these couples with a spouse
of foreign stock involved out-marriage in
the sense that they included one spouse
born of native parents or of a different
foreign stock. Out-marriage was most likely
to have occurred among persons from
countries where the same language prevails
or from which a large proportion of those
migrating to this country had the same
cultural heritage in other respects including
religion. Half again as much out-marriage
by national origin occurred among those in
the second generation as among those in
the first generation in the United States.
Differences in the numbers of men and
women who have migrated to this country
from a given foreign country have also affected the amount of out-migration by national origin.

The census data for married couples on
which these findings are based have a
number of technical] limitations which have
already been pointed out. Still another
limitation is the possibly larger proportion
of mixed than unmixed marriages that end
in divorce over a given length of time.‘ In
general, however, these limitations minimize rather than exaggerate the actual
amount of intermarriage that occurs. Until
statistics from marriage records by ethnic
characteristics become available on a nationwide basis, census data remain the only
source of national statistics on intermarriage
among ethnic groups.

4 Evidence that divorce was not as high among
Negro-white marriages as among unmixed marriages according to 1944-67 data for Iowa is reported in Thomas P. Monahan, 1970.
