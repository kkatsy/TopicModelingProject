Stability of Unions and Fertility

in Barbados

On the basis of her classic study of the
Jamaican family structure, Blake (1955)
declared that the fertility of the island
would be significantly higher than it is
now—probably over 30% higher—if all
lower-class Jamaican sexual unions were
relatively stable. This viewpoint was also
supported by another study by Stycos and
Back (1964). The main rationale behind
this observation is that the multiple unions
which are common among lower-class families of the Caribbean islands give rise to
considerable periods of time when the
woman is not sexually active and hence not
likely to become pregnant.

In the Caribbean in general, and more
specifically in the English-speaking islands,
there is a substantial amount of movement
from one sex partner to another and also a
very high percentage of reproduction outside of legal unions. Roberts and Braithwaite (1962, p. 218) observed that “a
woman may within the period during which
she is involved in a particular type of union
be associated successively with several different partners.” Goode (1960) concluded
that there is little moral, social, and legal
stigma attached to this pattern of union
formation and reproduction.

Change of partners, however, is not a

form of promiscuous sexual relationship in
the Caribbean. A woman is usually associated with only one partner during a specified period of time; and since the change
of partners is generally initiated by the

male, the woman is without a sexual partner

for the length of time it takes her to begin
a new relationship. This is the reason why
Roberts and Braithwaite (1962, p. 234)
argue that the “number of partners with
whom a woman has been associated in the
course of her reproductive life must weigh heavily in determining relative indices of
stability.” Blake’s study (1955; see also
Blake, 1961), as we have stated earlier,
argues that the instability caused by the
change of partners reduces the number of
pregnancies a woman may be expected to
have because of the time lapse between
partners when the woman is not sexually
active.

Another point of view suggests that multiple unions may nonetheless encourage
high fertility levels. Stycos and Back
(1964) suggest that there is a tendency for
children to be desired in each union. Blake
(1955, p. 31) suggests two rationales for a
possible association between multiple unions
and high fertility. First, women believe that
children in themselves add more stability

144.

to a union than is achieved by the merely
companionate relationship; and _ second,
women want these additional children because the men want them and if they (the
women) do not comply, the men will go
elsewhere. However, she argues that in
actual fact the desire to have children in
each new union may not tend to increase
fertility, because the Jamaican lower class
women do not use contraceptives and hence
the desire to have or not to have children
is not a determinant of fertility once the
woman is in a sexual union.

The present study which is based on
interviews of 461 women of reproductive
ages of the lower socioeconomic class in
Barbados consists of a different type of
sample from that of Blake. As has been
discussed elsewhere (Ebanks, 1968, 1969,
1970), most of the women in the present
sample have at one time or another used
contraceptives. The desire for children of
the women in this sample could thus possibly be crucial in determining their fertility.

This study is an attempt to evaluate the
role of instability of unions in the fertility
behavior of the Barbadian women in the
present sample. The number of partners
with whom a woman has been associated in
her life has been used as an index of instability of the union. The rationale behind
this is that the higher the number of partners the higher the instability of unions.

THE SAMPLE

For the present study, the data were obtained from a sample of 461 Barbadian
women of lower socioeconomic status.
These women form a small subgroup of the
cases interviewed by the Population Council
Research Project (PCRP) which was in
operation between May, 1965, and December, 1967. This project was Jaunched by the
Bio-medical Division of the Population
Council of New York in order to study the
relationship between cervical cancer and
intrauterine contraceptive devices.

A systematic sample of 500 women who
were visiting the family planning clinics at
regular intervals for checkups was drawn.
A backup sample of another 100 clients was
also drawn. This was done by using an electronic computer with the aim that these
two samples would yield 500 completed
questionnaires equally divided between
IUD users and nonusers. Only 461 are included in this study because of failure to
locate and interview the other sample units.
The cases were interviewed either at the
clinic or at home by trained interviewers.

The survey also was intended as a reliability-validity check on the data obtained
by the records of the PCRP. Of the women
in our sample, 406 had used one or more
methods of contraceptive. The fertility history as well as many other socioeconomic
data were obtained for each woman using
an interviewer-applied questionnaire.

DATA

In our sample, 24.30% of all women had
been associated with one sex partner,
29.50% with two partners, 22.99% with
three, 14.10% with four, and the remaining
9.11% with five or more partners. On the
average, a woman was observed to have
sexual relations with 2.6 partners (s=
1.35).

Changes in union status frequently occur
without a change of partner. The typical
pattern is one of a “visiting” sexual relationship becoming a common-law union and
eventually leading to marriage with the
Same partner, thus yielding three union
types but only one partner. Numerous other
patterns exist, however, involving more
than one partner. We hypothesize that there
is a relationship between type of union and
number of partners. It is clear from Table 1
that nearly 65% of the married women had
sexual relations with two partners or Jess.
The percentages for common-law and visiting unions are 49.6% and 40.4%, respectively. We observe that the mean number

of sex partners is the least for married
women, while it is the highest for women
in “visiting” relationships. We find a very
significant association between the current
union and the number of sex partners.
Although it seems somewhat misleading
to predict the number of partners on the
basis of current union status which itself

has passed through other types of union,
the above observation does indicate that the
increase in the number of partners is not a
function of increasing age; otherwise the
women in married unions, who are generally
older, should have had a greater number of
partners. Table 2 also supports this observation. The average number of sex partners

seems to be increasing slightly up to the
age group 30-34 and then declines. The
trend is therefore not a linearly increasing
one. The inverse association between age
and the number of partners does not seem
to be significant. One might argue that
older women did not recall and report the
number of partners as accurately as did the
younger women.

We have discussed earlier that women
may desire to bear children in each new
union in order to make the union more
stable (Blake, 1955, 1961; Stycos and
Back, 1964). It is evident from Table 3

of women who had only one sex partner. At
the time of the last pregnancy, we find that
there were only 26.41% of the women who
had had sexual relations with just one partner; 28.57% of the women had had sexual
relations with two partners; 26.41% with
three partners; and 18.61%, with four or
more partners. It is clear that the percentage of women with one partner shows a
sharp decline with the increase of the number of pregnancies. The percentage of
women with two partners increases up to
the second pregnancy, but again shows a
decline. The percentages of women with

pregnancies, 74% had been associated with
one partner, 14.44% with two partners,
7.78% with three partners, and only 3.78%

one partner, 36% with two partners,
11.68% with three partners, and 7.06%

three and four or more partners show a
slow but continuous increasing trend. Overall, we find the average number of sex partners has increased with increasing childbirth.

The age at first sex experience and the
number of sex partners show an inverse
relationship (Gamma = —0.366). Table 4
shows that among women who had their first
sex experience at or below age 16 years,
16.92% had been associated with one partner, 27.07% with two partners, 26.32%

seems somewhat different for the women
who had their first sex experience at or
beyond 17 years. Among them 34.36% had
been associated with one partner, 29.50%
with two partners, 22.99% with three,
14.10% with four, and 9.11% with five or
more partners. The average number of sex
partners for the former group of women
was 2.86, while it was 2.21 for the latter
group.

We observed that the fertility of women
with a fewer number of sex partners was
lower than that of women with a greater
number of partners. Although we do not see
a clear positive association between the
number of partners and fertility, when the
average number of live births per mother
was standardized by using the age distribution of all mothers, we find a slightly increasing trend in fertility with the increase
in number of sex partners (see Table 5).
Thus, our sample does not seem to support

the hypothesis that fertility is lowered by
unstable unions.

The possible under-reporting of live
births during the late ages merits our attention. The women in the age group 45-49
years show an appreciably lower fertility
than the women in the age group 40-44
years. This may have occurred because
older women do not report as accurately
the number of children ever born as do the
younger women. This is likely due to
memory lapse on the part of the older
women in accurately revealing their fertility
performances (United Nations, 1967,
p. 31). However, this does not seem to be
the reason why the number of live births
per woman should be higher for unstable
unions. Actually, one might argue that the
women in the unstable unions might be less
able to recall all live births and might
report their fertility performance more inaccurately than the women who have not

been associated with many partners. If
births were reported more accurately, a difference in the fertility performances of
women in stable and unstable unions might
become more distinct than it is at present.

Some related aspects of the period of
exposure to pregnancy have also been
studied and may shed some light on this

phenomenon. We can see from Table 6 that
the mean age at first sex experience for
women with three or more partners is significantly lower than that for women with
two partners or less. The inverse relationship between age at entry into union and
fertility performance might explain the
above phenomenon. That is to say, women

with a fewer number of partners might be
experiencing lower fertility because of
higher age at first sex experience. One
striking feature which is evident from
Table 6 is that the mean age at termination
of first pregnancy for the women with
fewer partners is significantly higher than
that for the women with a greater number
of partners, It is important to note that the
latter group started cohabitation at a relatively early age and terminated the first
pregnancy at a relatively higher age. It
means that the exposure to pregnancy
before the first conception for the women
with fewer partners is lower than for the
others. This might lead one to suspect the
role of instability of unions in discouraging
the fertility level before first conception.
However, the role of adolescent sterility for
women who entered into a union at as early
an age as 16 years or below must be taken
into account (Fortes, 1954, p. 297-299;
Talwar, 1965).

So as to avoid the misunderstanding that
earlier age at first sex experience for the
women with greater number of partners
would have given rise to greater period of
exposure to the risk of pregnancy, we calculated the mean length of reproductive life
span as well as the mean duration of exposure to pregnancy for both the groups of
women. This was done by calculating the
mean age at termination of last pregnancy
(even though most of the women have not
completed their reproductive life span).
Although it was found that the mean length
of reproductive life span and mean duration

of exposure to pregnancy for the women
with three or more partners were greater
than the others, the mean interval between
pregnancies in a relatively more stable
union is similar to that in a relatively less
stable union.

SUMMARY

In this study an attempt was made to
evaluate the role of unstable unions (measured in terms of the number of sex partners with whom a woman has been associated during her reproductive life) in the
fertility performance of a sample of 461
women of the lower socioeconomic class of
the island of Barbados. It was observed
that there was no appreciable difference between the fertility performance of the
women who had sex relations with either a
lesser or a greater number of partners. The
conventional hypothesis that the considerable periods of nonexposed time to pregnancy caused by multiple unions encourages
low fertility was not supported.

In contrast to the conventional hypothesis, the age-adjusted fertility rate tended
to increase with the increase in the number
of sex partners. Two possible reasons for
such an observation are suggested: (1) the
women in the unstable unions started sex
relations at an early age; and (2) most of
the women in the sample had used contraceptives at one time or the other and, therefore, the desire to have children in each
new union may have been operative in increasing fertility in unstable unions.
