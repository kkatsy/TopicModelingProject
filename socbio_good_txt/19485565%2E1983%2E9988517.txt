ABSTRACT: Various studies on marriage patterns in India have indicated that the incidence of
consanguineous marriages varies according to linguistic groups. This study was carried out in
an area of culture contact of several different linguistic groups. A study of five endogamous
tribal groups showed that the degree of consanguinity and type of consanguineous marriages
were closely related to the linguistic area to which each population belonged. The Raj Gonds,
Kolams, and Pradhans had a high inbreeding coefficient similar to that of rura] populations of
Andhra Pradesh; the Andhs showed a lower coefficient similar to that of Maharashtra, their
area of origin; and the Mathuras, a nomadic North Indian group, showed a very low inbreeding
coefficient, which is characteristic of North India.

Various studies on marriage patterns
in India have indicated that the incidence of consanguineous marriages varies according to the linguistic group to
which the people belong. The frequency
of such marriages is lowest in North India, the zone of Indo-European languages, and increases as one goes south
into the zone of the Dravidian group of
languages (Sanghvi, 1966).

The northern part of Andhra Pradesh forms a region of culture contact
between Central and South India. A
study of mating patterns was carried out

black soil. Three of the tribal groups—
the Raj Gonds, Kolams, and
Pradhans—have been associated over a
long period in Utnoor taluka. The Raj
Gonds are the largest group in this area
and are believed to have established
kingdoms in the Central Provinces at
Mandla and Betul (Madhya Pradesh)
and Chanda (Maharashtra) during the
fourteenth century. They were finally
defeated by the Marattas in the eighteenth century (Russel and Hiralal, 1916,
Vol. II). The ruins of stone first seen at
Chanda, Betul, Mandla, and Utnoor

on five endogamous tribal groups living
in Utnoor taluka, Adilabad District,
Andhra Pradesh State. Since accurate
historical data are not available about
the origin and distribution of these tribal
groups, the study of marriage distance
patterns in these groups may throw
some light on genetic migration over at
least a period of two generations.

The area of study is geologically contiguous with the major portion of Maharashtra State, consisting of fertile

are settled agriculturists who grow sorghum as their staple crop and cotton asa
cash crop.

The Kolams are both food gatherers
and shifting agriculturists who cultivate
hill slopes and therefore tend to settle in
comparatively isolated villages in hilly
and forested areas. Although they are
economically more backward than the
Raj Gonds, they have cultural and lin

guistic affinities with them. The Raj
Gonds speak Gondi, and the Kolams
speak Kolami, both being dialects of the
Dravidian group of languages (Emeneau, 1955).

The Pradhans are closely associated
with the Raj Gonds as their bards and
geneologists. They are bilingual, speaking Marathi among themselves, and also
speaking Gondi fluently, reciting poems
in Gondi. They are treated as an un
= touchable caste in Maharashtra (Hivale,
a | 1946). Although the Raj Gonds do not

S they consider the Pradhans inferior and

o The other two groups, the Andhs and

rz a small group having migrated from the
& Nanded, Parbhani, and Yeotmal disS tricts of Maharashtra State to settle in

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data were collected according to
a multi-stage sampling technique. Each
of the five groups was treated separately
so as to constitute a universe within
which villages were the first-stage units
and adult individuals within the villages
were the second-stage units. The total
number of married couples surveyed
were 397, 283, 114, 99, and 93 in the Raj

Gonds, Kolams, Pradhans, Andhs, and
Mathuras respectively. The type and
time of marriage as well as place of birth
of the spouses was collected. The marriage distance was calculated in kilometers by recording the road distance between the place of birth of spouses. The
average inbreeding coefficient a was
defined (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer,
1971) as 2 P;F; where P; is the proportion
of each type of consanguinous marriage
and F; to the inbreeding coefficient, i.e.,
the probability that two genes in the offspring are identical by descent from one
common ancestor.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The highest average inbreeding coefficients were found in the Pradhans, KoJams, and Raj Gonds, being 0.032,
0.028, and 0.021 respectively. The coefficients were lower in the two immigrant
populations, the Andhs from Maharashtra and the Mathuras from North
India, being 0.0145 and 0.0047 (Table
1). The inbreeding coefficients of the
three local tribal populations of Andhra
Pradesh were comparable to those of
the rural populations of the northeastem part of Andhra Pradesh to which
this area of study belongs.

The consanguinous marriages were
predominantly of the first-cousin type
(cross-cousins) with a negligible number
of uncle-niece or other related marriages. In all these tribal populations,
except the Mathuras, the cross-cousin
type of first-cousin marriage is the most
prevalent. This type of marriage is a
general feature of the kinship systems of
most South Indian populations as well as
of tribal populations of Central India
and Northeastern India. The major
tribes of Central India, such as the Bhils
and Gonds as well as the Northeastern

tribes, such as the Nagas (except Angamas), Galongs, Daflas, and Miris, practice cross-cousin marriages. Besides a
preference for consanguinous marriages, low occupational mobility in
these groups may also account for the
very high frequency of consanguinous
marriages in these four groups. Although the Mathuras migrated from
North India where consanguinous marriages are taboo, the practice of firstcousin marriage on a small scale may be
due to restricted choice in a small population which has taken up settled cultivation and left its original nomadic activity, hence becoming isolated from the
rest of its group.

Since age at marriage was difficult to
obtain accurately in these populations,
whose members are not literate, the
time of marriage was determined by
whether it occurred before or after menarche (first menstruation) which is an
important event that can be easily remembered. The frequency of marriages
before menarche was highest in the Andhs, Raj Gonds, and Pradans, being 88
per cent, 79 per cent and 71 per cent respectively (Table 2). It was much lower
in the Kolams and Mathuras, being 52
per cent and 25 per cent respectively.

ring before menarche in the Andhs, Raj
Gonds, and Pradhans may be due to the
influence of local Hindu customs. It was
less frequent in a primitive shifting agricultural group like the Kolams and in a
nomadic group like the Mathuras who
are relatively less influenced by local
Hindu customs.

The mean marriage distance in all
five groups was small, indicating reStricted mobility and genetic migration
(Table 3). It was highest in the Andhs,
being 54 kilometers, and much lower in
the Mathuras, Pradhans, Kolams and
Raj Gonds, being 27 km., 26 km., 23
km., and 19 km. respectively. However,
the median values (Table 3) were different from the mean values in all five
groups, indicating a non-Gaussian distribution. The higher mean marriage
distance in the Andhs indicates that migration had occurred between the main
parent group living in the Vidharbha
area of Maharashtra and the smaller
group in Utnoor taluka which had split
from the main group (Fig. 1). The older

generation of Andhs who had migrated
over large distances contributed to this
higher average value, whereas the
present younger generation preferred
marriages at short distances (40 per cent
of marriages occurring within the same
village). The maximum genetic migration was up to a distance of 320 km. in
this group. The other four groups had
smaller average marriage distances, migration occurring at a maximum distance of between 100-150 km. The low
mean marriage distance in the Mathuras
indicated that this group, which was
originally nomadic has now adopted a
settled occupation which has isolated it
from the rest of their people in North India.

The marriage distance distribution
was calculated (Table 3) for all five
groups and indicated that the Kolams
and Pradhans are more mobile than are
the Mathuras and Raj Gonds (Figs. 2
and 3). The probable reason is that the
Kolams have a tendency to change their
villages permanently (diffusional migra

Pradhans being bards, visit various Raj
Gond villages but return to their residence after their work is completed

mobility due to a more settled agricultural occupation. The Andhs have a

of these populations. The average marriage distance is low in all five populations, indicating restricted mobility due
to the fact that their occupation is settled
agriculture. However, out of these five
groups, the Andhs show a greater range
of marriage distance indicating that until
