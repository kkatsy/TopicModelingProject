Multiple Causes of Death
and the Epidemiological Transition
in American Samoa

ABSTRACT: Multiple-cause mortality data were used to examine changing patterns of mortality
between 1950 and 1979 in American Samoa. This period coincided with a transition from
infectious to chronic diseases as the primary causes of death. The available data indicate that as
mortality rates from infections declined, the first chronic disease to increase in frequency was
cancer. The absence of a lag period suggests that increased cancer mortality may be a
consequence of life extension in the presence of modernization. In contrast, mortality rates from
cardiovascular diseases tended to increase only after a lag period. As mortality from infections
declined, ischemic heart disease replaced infections as the leading cause of death, in either a
total-mentions or an underlying-cause model of mortality. The transition to degenerative
disease mortality in American Samoa was neither as rapid nor as simple as a tabulation by
underlying cause of death indicates. Patterns of change were interrelated.

When societies modernize economically and socially (Tipps, 1973), they undergo a shift in cause-of-death patterns
(Notestein, 1953; Preston, 1976; Tietlebaum, 1975), frequently referred to as
an epidemiological transition (Omran,
1971). The final stage of such transitions
typically includes a decline in deaths attributed to infections and an increase in
deaths attributed to degenerative diseases. The theory of the epidemiologic
transition helped explain part of the
trends and differentials in mortality in
developed and developing populations.
However, the specific morbidity patterns associated with such change in the
structure of underlying causes of death
have yet to be identified.

Recent analyses using multiple
causes of death (Israel et al., 1986; Manton and Stallard, 1984) provide methods

that not only more clearly reflect morbidity patterns, but may also improve
our understanding of the transition to
degenerative-diseases mortality (Manton et al., 1976; Nam, 1986). In this context, “multiple causes of death” refers
to all conditions recorded on death certificates, whether or not they are designated as the underlying cause of death.
Each decedent is assigned only a single
underlying cause of death, but may have
multiple conditions listed on the death
certificate. These conditions provide the
data for the analyses of multiple causes
of death.

The objective of this work was to
specify more clearly the pattern of
change associated with the final transition to a predominance of chronic disease mortality in one South Pacific island society by using two different

models of mortality: underlying cause of
death (UCD) and multiple causes of
death, expressed as total mentions (TM)
of a specific condition. The guiding hypothesis was that during the transition to
degenerative disease mortality, reductions in infectious and pandemic diseases are associated with specific
changes in mortality from chronic
causes. It was hypothesized that interactions between disease processes exist
which lead to certain degenerative diseases, such as cancer, increasing in frequency before others, such as cerebrovascular disease, which may display a
lag period (Walker, 1975). The multiple
cause-of-death approach permits examination of the total contribution of each
disease to mortality throughout the period of transition. Examination of total
mentions of specific conditions on death
certificates may suggest new associations between causes of death and modernization unsuspected in analyses of
underlying causes.

American Samoa is well suited to this
study. Although American Samoans retain many aspects of their traditional
culture, they have experienced rapid sociocultural change since World War II
(Baker and Hanna, 1986; Crews, 1985,
1988, ms). A comprehensive mortality
registration system has been maintained
in American Samoa since early in the
twentieth century (Crews, 1985, 1988,
1988, ms; Levin and Wright, 1980; Park,
1972). These records have been used to
document improvements in life expectancy and declines in mortality rates from
1950 to 1980 among American Samoans
(Baker and Crews, 1986; Crews, 1985,
1986, 1988, ms). Such changes are frequently reported when a population enters the final stages of epidemiological
transition (Omran, 1971, 1977). Ameri

can Samoa provides an unique opportunity to examine the pattern of change in
multiple-cause mortality associated with
a shift to degenerative diseases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
STUDY SAMPLE

American Samoa is a group of five
high volcanic islands lying in the South
Pacific about 15 degrees below the equator and just east of the International
Dateline, which runs between the Samoan and the Fijian Islands. Tutuila,
the main island upon which over 90 per
cent of the population of American Samoa resided in 1974 (Levin and Wright,
1980), comprises a total land area of less
than 76 square miles. In 1974, 67 per
cent of adult males and 37 per cent of
adult females were employed and earning weekly wages (Levin and Wright
1980). The remainder were generally
engaged in traditional subsistence and
household activities.

Since 1962, the L.B.J. Tropical Medical Center, located in the Pago Pago or
central area of American Samoa, has
been a major provider of health care in
the islands. The Medical Center houses
the Vital Statistics Office, where birth
and death records are archived, and the
Public Health Department, which maintains nurses in clinics throughout the islands. The public health nurses are usually familiar with all health problems
that occur in households of villages for
which they provide care (Bindon, 1985).
Births and deaths are reported to either
the outlying public health clinics or the
Health Center. It is generally accepted
that American Samoan death records
are relatively complete (Crews, 1988;
Park, 1972).

Previous ANALYSES

Previous analyses reported that longevity increased and mortality declined
in American Samoa between 1950 and
1980 (Baker and Crews, 1986; Crews,
1985, 1986, 1988, ms; Crews and Mackeen, 1982). Among Samoan men, life
expectancy at birth increased 10 years,
17 per cent; among women, it increased
18 years, 32 per cent. Proportionately,
the largest improvements in life expectancy occurred at older ages. At age 65,
men gained 4 and women gained 10
years, increases of 33 and 125 per cent.
During this same period the crude mortality rate declined 64 per cent from 12.0
to 4.3 per 1,000 (Baker and Crews,
1986; Crews, 1985).

TECHNIQUES OF ANALYSIS

During fieldwork in American Samoa as part of the Samoan Studies Project (Baker and Crews, 1986; Baker and
Hanna, 1986), 4,502 death certificates
officially registered between 1950 and
1981 were microfilmed at the Vital Statistics Office. Data reported on these
certificates were coded for underlying
cause of death (UCD) following protocols outlined in the 9th revision of the
International Classification of Diseases
(ICD-9; WHO, 1977). At that time a
maximum of three multiple causes were
coded. The second and third causes
were determined consecutively, using
the same ICD—9 protocols.

Several methods for the analysis of
multiple causes of death have been proposed. The most frequently used, because of its simplicity, is total mentions
(TM) (Guralnick, 1966; Krueger,
1966a, 6; Manton and Stallard, 1984;
Nam, 1986; Wrigley and Nam, 1986).
All items reported in either Parts I or II
of the cause-of-death section of the

Social Biology

death certificate are assumed to be of
equal epidemiological concern. However, since for standard mortality classification an UCD is assigned, this information is retained for comparisons
between the UCD and TM.

For this analysis, seven conditions
were selected for inclusion based on previous research using UCD which
showed variable patterns of change.
These included increases, decreases,
and relative stability in UCD mortality
rates from diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and infections (Baker
and Crews, 1986; Crews, 1985, 1988,
ms; Crews and MacKeen, 1982). The
seven selected conditions included infections, cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), divided into
ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), hypertension,
and generalized arteriosclerosis (Table
1).

To determine TM, the frequency
with which each condition of interest appeared on the set of death certificates
was totaled. Sex-specific mortality rates
were calculated using either TM or
UCD assignments as the numerator and

the population at risk of dying in the denominator. Ratios of TM to UCD assignments were also calculated and each
of the seven conditions was ranked by its
proportional contribution to mortality
as either TM or UCD. To help control
for stochastic variability which occurs in
populations as small as that of American
Samoa (18,937 in 1950, and 32,297 in
1980), and to allow a sufficient number
of vital events in relatively rare disease
categories, mortality rates and ratios
were determined by five-year periods.
In previous analyses, mortality rates
were determined using different time intervals and methods; thus rates reported
here may differ somewhat from those
reported elsewhere (Baker and Crews,
1986; Crews, 1985, 1988, ms; Crews and
MacKeen, 1982).

RESULTS

The proportion of death certificates
with more than one recorded cause increased with time in American Samoa
(Table 2). This finding was true for both
sexes and continued from 1950 through
1974, after which the proportion of certificates with more than one or two

Multiple Causes of Death

201

causes declined to about the same level
as was observed in 1965-69. In 1950-54,
74 per cent of male deaths and 77 per
cent of female deaths listed only a single
cause of death. By 1975-79, only 48 per
cent of male and 47 per cent of female
deaths listed only a single cause. The
most substantial increase was in death
certificates listing three or more causes.
For both sexes this fraction increased
nine-fold, from 3 to 27 per cent, between 1950-54 and 1970-74, but declined into 1975-79. Certificates containing two causes increased two-fold
for men, from 20 to 40 per cent, and 48
per cent for women during the study
period.

MorTALiTy RATES

In 1950-54, the total mortality rate
was the same for men and women, 88/
10,000 (Table 3). From 1955-59
through 1975-79, rates declined for
both sexes. However, total mortality declined more rapidly among Samoan
women (64 per cent) than it did among
Samoan men (37 per cent).

In 1950-54, although UCD and TM
mortality rates for the seven conditions
examined were about the same for men

and women (Table 3), for all six chronic
diseases, mortality rates for women exceeded those for men. Conversely, men
showed higher mortality rates from residual causes and for TM infections. TM
mortality rates exceeded the UCD rates
in 1950-54 for all causes except hypertension in both men and women and diabetes and arteriosclerosis in women. In
almost every five-year interval, over 50
per cent of mortality was assigned to the
residual category.

By both the TM and UCD definitions, mortality rates from infections decreased more rapidly between 1950-54
and 1975-79 than did total mortality
rates (Table 3). Among men, the UCD
rate declined 88 per cent; among
women, 89 per cent. TM mortality rates
declined somewhat less, 81 and 83 per
cent. Declines in TM and UCD rates
from infections were steeper between
1950-54 and 1960-64 than in the later
period, when rates were already at relatively low levels (Figure 1a). When mortality rates from infections were at their
lowest level, in 1975-79, TM rates exceeded UCD rates by 100 per cent in
men and 79 per cent in women. In general, mortality rates from the remaining
six causes tended to increase among
men, except for arteriosclerosis. Among
women, greater variability was observed, with cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease showing increases in either TM or UCD
mortality rates at some points and decreases at others.

Among American Samoans, TM and
UCD mortality rates corresponded
most closely for cancer and diabetes
(Table 3). In 1950-54, the cancer UCD
mortality rate was 83 per cent of the TM
rate for men; for women it was 96 per
cent. In 1975-79 the corresponding values were 92 per cent and 97 per cent.

Multiple Causes of Death

 

203

Among men, TM mortality rates from
cancer increased most between 1955-59
and 1960-64 (54 per cent); among
women, between 1950-54 and 1955~59
(42 per cent). During these same periods UCD mortality rates from infections
showed their largest declines, 10.0 and
10.9 per 10,000, respectively. In men,
both TM and UCD cancer mortality
rates declined after 1960-64 (Figure
1b), and both increased after 1970-74.
In general, differences between TM and
UCD rates were larger for men than for
women, although TM rates never exceeded UCD rates by more than 1/
10,000.

Mortality from diabetes increased for
both sexes. Unexpectedly, TM and
UCD rates for diabetes increased apace
and were usually almost equal. In most
samples, diabetes is mentioned more
frequently on death certificates than it is
assigned as the UCD (Manton and Stallard, 1984). TM and UCD mortality
rates from diabetes gradually increased
until 1960-64. In 1965-69, mortality
rates from diabetes abruptly increased,
among men as UCD 214 per cent and as
T™ 9314 per cent; among women as
UCD 217 per cent and as TM 333 per
cent. These increases were not correlated with change in any other rates, and
by 1975-79 diabetes mortality rates had
declined somewhat.

Among men, both TM and UCD
mortality rates from vascular diseases
generally increased; among women this
was not true (Table 3). For men the
UCD mortality rate for IHD increased
by 126 per cent from 1950-54 to 197074, but then declined into 1975-79, increasing through the study period by 88
per cent. Correspondingly, the TM rate
increased by 154 per cent during the
same period, almost twice as much as
the UCD rate, and plateaued rather

than declining between 1970-74 and
1975-79 (Figure 1c). This finding suggests that among Samoan men IHD was
becoming an important contributor to
death more rapidly than UCD data

might suggest. TM and UCD mortality’

rates from IHD among women declined
from 1950 to 1960-64. For women both
rates began to rise in 1965-69, but only
the TM rate had returned to its 1950-54
level in 1975-79. In 1950-54, both TM
and UCD mortality rates from IHD
were higher among Samoan women
than men—41 and 22 per cent. By
1975-79 the TM and UCD mortality
rates froom IHD among women were

only 39 and 44 per cent of the men’s
rates.

While mortality rates from infections
were declining most rapidly, from 195054 to 1960-64, TM and UCD mortality
rates from IHD in men and women also
declined (Figure 1a@ and ic). After 196064, while mortality rates from infections
continued to decline, among Samoan
men mortality rates for IHD began to
rise and were above their 1950-54 levels
by 1965-69. They continued to rise into
the mid—1970’s as infections declined,
but UCD mortality rates from IHD declined in 1975-79 while TM rates plateaued at their 1970-74 level (Figure
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:42 08 December 2015

Vol. 35, No. 3—4

1c). For women, both TM and UCD
mortality rates from IHD began to rise
at the same time, but only the TM rates
had regained their former levels by
1970-74, after which both TM and
UCD rates declined somewhat. These
results suggest a lag period between the
decline in mortality from infections and
the increase in mortality from IHD.
Among men, at the time that IHD rates
started to increase, mortality rates from
cancer showed a decline, about 196064; later, when mortality rates from
IHD declined slightly, cancer increased,
in 1975-79 (Figures 1b and 1c).

Both TM and UCD mortality rates
for cerebrovascular disease (stroke) increased steadily among men from 195054 to 1970-74 and among women from
1955-59 to 1970-74 (Table 3). In 1975—
79, these rates declined substantially in
both sexes (Figure 1d). TM and UCD
mortality rates from stroke were higher
among women than among men in
1950-54 by 30 and 57 per cent. Among
men the UCD rate increased slightly
more from 1950-54 to 1970-~74, 343 per
cent, than did the TM rate, 295 per cent.
However, in 1975-79 the TM rate retained a larger portion of its increase,
215 percent, than did the UCD rate, 186
per cent. As mortality from infections
declined among men, stroke mortality
increased steadily without any sign of a
lag period (Figures 1a and 1d).

Among women, mortality rates from
stroke declined slightly, TM by 35 per
cent and UCD by 32 per cent, during the
early period of decline in infectiousdisease mortality (Table 3). By 1960-64
the TM rate had increased to its earlier
level; by 1965-69 both rates were above
their 1950—54 levels. This increase continued until 1975-79 when both IHD
and stroke mortality rates decreased
precipitously. Thus, in 1975-79 UCD

Multiple Causes of Death

 

205

rates from stroke were at about their
1950—54 level, while TM rates were 27
per cent greater in 1975-79, and 57 per
cent higher than the UCD rate. The
UCD rate suggests that in 1975-79 cerebrovascular disease was only a slightly
more frequent cause of death among Samoan women than it had been in 195054. Among men the stroke TM rate was
58 per cent higher than the UCD rate in
1975-79, suggesting a greater contributory influence of stroke on death in Samoan men than women. A lag period,
such as was observed for IHD, was not a
component of mortality change in cerebrovascular disease for men, but may
have been for women (Figure 1d).

In both sexes, as both TM and UCD,
the influence of arteriosclerosis on mortality declined, while that of hypertension increased (Table 3). The highest
TM and UCD mortality rates from arteriosclerosis were observed in 1950-54,
when rates were slightly higher among
women. In 1975-79, TM and UCD
rates among men were 15 per cent and
among women 22 per cent of their 195054 levels. In 1950-54 arteriosclerosis
contributed more to mortality than did
diabetes, stroke, or hypertension. By
1975-79, as both TM and UCD, arteriosclerosis was the least important contributor to mortality of all conditions examined.

Hypertension, whose TM and UCD
mortality rates ranked above only diabetes in 1950-54, became an important
contributor to mortality in 1975-79. In
1950-54, among men, hypertension was
assigned as UCD whenever mentioned.
Thereafter, TM and UCD rates increased steadily to 1965-69, then UCD
rates began to decline while the TM rate
continued to increase. In 1975-79, the
UCD mortality rate from hypertension
was 125 per cent higher than it was in

1950-54. Meanwhile, the TM rate had
increased nine-fold. In comparison,
among women, the UCD mortality rate
from hypertension was the same in
1950-54 and 1975-79, but the TM rate
had increased by 123 per cent. For
women, a lag, before a rapid increase in
hypertension as a condition reported on
death certificates, is suggested.

RELATIVE RANKINGS OF CAUSES
OF DEATH

Fach cause of death, except the residual, was ranked by its relative contribution to total mortality in each five-year
period, using both TM and UCD criteria (Table 4). For both sexes and both
TM and UCD, infections remained the
leading cause of death until 1965-69.
When infections ceased to be the leading cause of death, the new leading
cause of death was consistently ischemic
heart disease (THD).

For women, infections were still the
leading UCD in 1975-79. It was only in
the last interval that even TM rates indicated that IHD was replacing infections
as the leading cause of death among
women. By contrast, infections remained the leading TM among men
through 1970-74, after which they were
the second leading TM cause. Infections
declined to the third and fourth leading
UCD for men in 1970-74 and 1975-79,
respectively.

Except in 1970-74, cancer was the
second leading UCD among men from
1950-54 to 1975-79. Cancer was also
the second most prevalent TM until
1960-64, after which it became the third
from 1965-69, and then the fourth leading cause from 1970-74 to 1975-79. For
Samoan women, cancer was the second
or third major UCD from 1950-54 to
1975-79. However, as TM cancer was

 

Social Biology

ranked fourth from 1970-74 on, when
both IHD and cerebrovascular disease
were ranked higher. Arteriosclerosis,
hypertension, and diabetes ranked lowest, fifth through seventh, as contributors to mortality by both TM and UCD
during most of the thirty years examined.

In 1975-79 IHD, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and infections ranked as
the first through fourth UCD for men
(Table 4). However, as TM, the relative
rankings were IHD, infections, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer. As TM, infections were more important determinants of total mortality levels late in the
epidemiologic transition than an analysis based solely on UCD reveals. TM
also suggest that, even though infections
remained the leading UCD among
women in 1975—79, both THD and
stroke were important contributors to
overall mortality levels (Table 4).

TOTAL MENTIONS TO UNDERLYING
CAUSE OF DEATH RATIOS

Ratios of TM of each condition to
UCD assignments were determined
(Table 5). These ratios indicate the propensity for a mortality factor to be assigned as the UCD when it is reported
on a death certificate.

In 1950—54, among Samoan men, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease,
and IHD were the conditions most
likely to be assigned as UCD when they
appeared on death certificates, while
cancer and diabetes were the least
likely. The TM/UCD ratio for cerebrovascular disease shows that this condition was mentioned 14 per cent more often than it appeared as an UCD. The
cancer TM/UCD ratio in 1950-54 indicates that cancer was reported 2.18
times on death certificates for each time
it was assigned as UCD; this was an

anomalous period, since in all others the
ratio was below 1.25. In 1950-54,
among Samoan women, cancer and
IHD were the most likely conditions to
be assigned as the UCD when present,
while diabetes and arteriosclerosis were
the least likely. When reported on the
death certificate in 1975-79, for both
men and women, cancer and diabetes
were the conditions most likely to be assigned as UCD, while hypertension and

infections were the least likely. These
ratios were generally higher for women.

One hypothesis guiding this research
was that infectious diseases would continue to be important factors in mortality after their contribution to UCD mortality rates declined. This hypothesis
was apparently correct for American Samoa. For men, the TM/UCD ratio for
infections increased from 1.23 to 2.00
between 1950-54 and 1975-79; among

women, it increased from 1.17 to 1.77,
indicating that TM for infections were
only 17 to 23 per cent more frequent
than UCD in 1950-54. By 1975-79,
among men, infections were reported
twice as frequently as they were assigned as UCD. Among women, the
1970-74 ratio was almost two (1.94), although in 1975~79 infections were only
77 per cent more frequent as TM. For
both sexes the decline in UCD assignments relative to TM was relatively constant over time. Thus, although mortality from infections apparently declined
as American Samoa entered the final
stages of the epidemiological transition,
infections continued to be important
contributors to TM mortality.

TM/UCD ratios indicate that when
cancer appears on a death certificate it is
likely to be assigned as UCD. No explanation for the high 1950~54 ratio among
men is apparent. Although cancer TM/
UCD ratios fluctuated over time they
were consistently among the lowest in
any five-year interval.

TM/UCD ratios for diabetes ranged
from 1.0 to 2.0. The ratio of 2.0 in 1950—
54 was due to only a single TM and the
addition of a single UCD to avoid division by zero. TM/UCD ratios for diabetes between 1950-54 and 1960-64
should probably be ignored since they
are based on at most two total mentions.
Conversely, the 1965-69 through 1975~
79 TM/UCD ratios indicate that for
both sexes diabetes was usually assigned
as UCD when it appeared on a death
certificate. Ratios were generally lower
for men and became more so with time.
In other populations diabetes TM/UCD
ratios are reported to be about four or
five (Manton and Stallard, 1984). The
high prevalence of diabetes in Samoans
and an awareness by medical personnel
of its health impact may explain why it is

Multiple Causes of Death

209

assigned as the UCD so frequently in
American Samoa.

In general, each of the four vascular
diseases examined were more likely to
be assigned as the UCD when present
on the death certificates in earlier years
(1950-64) than in later years (1965-79).
The 1950-54 ratios for both IHD and
cerebrovascular disease were among the
lowest for both sexes, suggesting that
when these causes were rarer they were
more likely to be assigned as UCD. As
time passed and these two causes were
more frequently mentioned on death
certificates, they also became less likely
to be assigned as UCD. This change led
to higher TM/UCD ratios in men from
1965-69 onward and among women after 1960-64. The same process probably
occurred for arteriosclerosis and hypertension, such that as they were more frequently mentioned they were assigned
less often as UCD.

DISCUSSION

The purpose of this investigation was
to examine relationships between declining mortality from infections and increasing mortality from degenerative
causes in American Samoa using two
different definitions of mortality: total
mentions (TM) and underlying causes
of death (UCD). TM express the total
contribution of a condition to mortality,
thereby allowing all available information regarding morbid conditions
present and recorded at the time of
death to be included in the analysis of
mortality patterns (Manton and Stallard, 1984; Nam, 1986). Rates and ratios
based on TM highlight conditions important in mortality, which may occur
frequently on death certificates but are
seldom assigned as UCD. TM/UCD ratios illustrate the proportion of the total

210

contribution of a condition to mortality
which UCD does not represent in mortality analysis.

Between 1950-54 and 1975-79, for
seven conditions, chosen for analysis because they either appeared frequently
on death certificates or were of interest
as chronic disease processes, mortality
rates generally declined. Declines were
usually larger for women than men. One
undesirable outcome of this categorization of mortality was that half of all conditions were assigned to a residual class.
Analyses not shown here indicate that
during earlier time intervals diseases affecting mothers and infants and during
later intervals trauma, particularly
among men, may have accounted for a
significant proportion of causes assigned
to the residual category. Furthermore, it
is well known that during periods of
lower diagnostic capabilities degenerative diseases, particularly cardiovascular
diseases, are assigned to other and illdefined conditions and senility (Preston,
1976). Assignments to such ill-defined
conditions may have led to lower mortality from chronic conditions in this
study than actually occurred. However,
this should not strongly affect the comparisons between TM and UCD presented here.

Between 1950-54 and 1975-79 the
frequency of reporting of multiple
causes on death certificates increased in
American Samoa. Whether this increase was related to changes in medical
procedures leading to greater diagnostic
accuracy or simply a trend toward more
complicated reporting of conditions
present at death is unclear from the
available data. The availability of multiple cause data for decedents in American Samoa increased most between
1960-64 and 1965-69. This change was
not reflected by any large change in ei

ther TM or UCD mortality rates. Furthermore, only among men did the TM/
UCD ratios change substantially during
this period, increasing for each cause of
death category, from 4 per cent for infections to 329 per cent for arterioscleroSis.

TM and UCD mortality rates from
infections decreased between 1950-54
and 1975-79. Interestingly, for both
sexes, TM and UCD rates showed similar declines. This similarity in patterns
of change did not hold for the other six
conditions examined, all of which increased in men, but only three of which
increased in women. From 1950-54 to
1960-64, when mortality rates from infections were showing their largest declines, mortality rates from cancer were
increasing. During this same period
deaths from IHD declined, while mortality rates from cerebrovascular diseases increased in men and decreased
slightly in women. Later, as mortality
from IHD increased, mortality from
cancer decreased, particularly among
Samoan men, and stroke mortality increased.

These results suggest that cancer may
be the first noninfectious disease to increase as a cause of death during late
stages of the epidemiological transition.
The absence of a lag period further suggests that increased mortality from neoplastic disease may not be a concomitant
of changing lifestyles or precursors of
disease associated with modernization,
but may instead be an inherent attribute
of human physiology expressed as life
expectancies increase in a population.
This result may be a reflection of the fact
that cancers are probably less related to
changing life styles and more related to
constitutional factors (Doll and Armstrong, 1981; Doll and Peto, 1981).

On the other hand, it is likely that the

Vol. 35, No. 34

vascular diseases, which generally do
show a lag period before a subsequent
increase, are more related to life-style
changes and require an induction period
before they increase in frequency as
causes of death. In this regard, the pattern of change in TM and UCD rates for
hypertension are of interest. For both
sexes, the TM mortality rate generally
increased, for men, 900 per cent between 1950-54 and 1970-74; for
women, 500 per cent between 1955-59
and 1970-74, while the UCD rate
showed little change. The tendency toward a steady increase in mortality rates
from hypertension in men suggests a
strong relationship with development.
However, the decline in this mortality
factor among women from 1950-54 to
1960-64 also suggests a sex differential
in this relationship. These results indicate that at least one precursor of IHD
and stroke was increasing with time
among Samoan decedents. Because of
very high mortality rates in 1950-54, a
similar argument cannot be made regarding arteriosclerosis.

Infections remained a major contributor to mortality even after they were no
longer the leading UCD. Among men,
infections were the third and fourth
leading UCD in 1970~74 and 1975-79,
but they remained the first and second
leading contributors to TM mortality.
Conversely, in 1975-79 when infections
were the leading UCD among women
they were second to IHD in TM. IHD
always replaced infections as the leading
TM or UCD, even though cancer may
have previously ranked second. Only
hypertension generally retained its relative ranking throughout the study.

For both sexes, arteriosclerosis and
hypertension were the least likely conditions to be assigned as UCD when
present. Infections became less likely to

Multiple Causes of Death

211

be assigned as an UCD with time, suggesting that part of the transition to degenerative diseases may reflect a difference in which condition is coded as
UCD when both an infection and a degenerative disease are present. THD and
stroke were also less likely to be assigned as UCD in later years. This finding may indicate that during periods
when degenerative diseases are less
common they are more likely to be assigned as UCD. However, as these diseases appear more frequently, other
conditions present at death are increasingly likely to be coded as UCD, perhaps because more than a single chronic
condition is present at the time of death.

In conclusion, the epidemiological
transition in American Samoa was neither as rapid nor as simple as a tabulation by UCD might suggest. Patterns of
disease change were interrelated and
specific degenerative diseases increased
in prevalence prior to the final fall in
mortality from infections, while others
showed a lag period of ten to twenty
years before increasing.
