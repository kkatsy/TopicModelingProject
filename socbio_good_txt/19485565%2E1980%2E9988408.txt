Erratum: Letter to the Editor by Ernest B. Hook on ‘‘Human Germinal
Mutations: Monitoring for Environmental Effects,’’ Vol. 26, No. 2, 1979

Because I did not see the galleys before
publication, several typographical errors
in the paper, “Human Germinal Mutations: Monitoring for Environmental Effects” (Social Biology 26:104-116, 1979)
were uncorrected before publication. The
most serious of these resulted in a printed
livebirth prevalence rate for the XO genotype of 1x 10~°; it should have read 1x10-4.

The rate for 47,+13 was given as
1x0.5x10-4; it should have read 10.5<10-* (that is between 0.5X10-* and
1x10-*). (In fact, recent data suggest
1X10- is in fact the best estimate.) Other
minor efrors are misspellings of authors’
names; “‘M. Neil’’ should be M. Nei, and
“A. A. Stein” is Z. A. Stein.
