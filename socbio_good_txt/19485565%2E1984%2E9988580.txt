A Note on the Determinants of Breastfeeding
Durations in an African Country

ABSTRACT: This paper utilizes data from the 1977-78 Kenya Fertility Survey, one component
of the World Fertility Survey, to analyze the determinants of breastfeeding durations for
women 15 to 50 years old who had their last-but-one live birth between 3 and 15 years prior to
the interview. Comparisons are made with the findings from the World Fertility Surveys in
eight other developing countries in Asia and Latin America. Findings indicate that literacy,
urban residence, secondary school education, and modern employment reduce the duration of
breastfeeding in Kenya. In addition, the subgroups of women who appear to be curtailing
breastfeeding are growing in proportional size or are composed of women who may be innovators or leaders. A continuation of this pattern into the future may increase levels of infant morbidity and mortality and, in the absence of increased modern contraceptive practice, may in
crease the societal level of fertility.

The popularity of breastfeeding has
been increasing in the United States and
in many developed countries, a reversal
of a trend away from breastfeeding
which began during the 1930’s, especially among upper- and middle-class
women (Hendershot, 1981; Hirschman
and Hendershot, 1979). On the other
hand, recent evidence from the developing world suggests that the duration of
breastfeeding may be declining among
the more ‘“‘modern’’ subgroups of
women—those who are more educated,
live in urban areas, and work in the
modern sector (Kent, 1981; Akin et al.,
1981; Romaniuk, 1980). Nutritionists
and health officials view with alarm the
possibility of an increase in bottle feeding in the developing world where infant
formulas may be over-diluted or diluted
with impure water by mothers unaware
of basic nutrition and sanitation concepts. In addition to providing the nec
essary nutritional needs for infants, 
breast milk transmits certain valuable

antibodies from mother to child, an important factor in developing countries
where health conditions are generally
poor (Baer, 1981). Therefore, a curtailment of breastfeeding in a developing
society might well result in poorer nutrition and in an increase in infant morbidity and mortality.
Development planners and demographers also view with alarm the prospect of a decrease in breastfeeding durations in the Third World because of the
increase in the aggregate levels of fertility which might result. Medical research
has demonstrated that the period of infertility after childbirth is prolonged biologically by the practice of breastfeeding
(Tyson and Perez, 1978). A reduction in
this period of lactational amenorrhea
brought about by the reduction of the
duration of breastfeeding has the potential for increasing the societal level of
fertility considerably. This is particularly true in developing societies where
modern contraceptive practice is un
279

likely to be substituted for the natural
fertility inhibiting effect of breastfeeding. In fact, Romaniuk (1980) has
shown that the increase in fertility at the
early stages of modernization documented in several African countries can
be attributed in part to a decrease in
breastfeeding durations.

A curtailment of breastfeeding durations in developing societies, therefore,
has only negative implications. It would
almost certainly result in poorer health
and nutrition and in an increase in infant
mortality. In addition, in the absence of
widespread modern contraceptive practice, it would also result in an increase in
the societal level of fertility. Whether
the developing world will follow the pattern of the developed world—that is,
whether breastfeeding will decline first
and perhaps increase again at a later
point—remains to be seen. Almost no
reliable trend data exist for the developing world and little is known about the
determinants of breastfeeding in developing societies.

This research will examine the determinants of breastfeeding duration in
Kenya, a developing East African soctety, in order to identify whether certain
subgroups of women appear to be curtailing breastfeeding, to infer future
trends based on the behavior of subgroups which either appear to be growing in proportional size or are composed
of innovators or leaders, and to suggest
the implications of these inferred trends
for Kenyan society. In addition, this
study compares the breastfeeding patterns in Kenya with the patterns in eight
other countries in Asia or Latin America. The countries used for comparison
are Bangladesh, Indonesia, Jordan, and
Sri Lanka in Asia, and Colombia, Guyana, Panama, and Peru in Latin America.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for this study are taken from
the Kenya Fertility Survey (KFS), one
component of the World Fertility Survey Program. Throughout this paper the
sample of Kenyan women is compared
with similar samples of women in eight
other countries which participated in the
World Fertility Survey.! A total of 8,100
women between the ages of 15 and 50
were interviewed in the KFS between
August, 1977, and June, 1978. The data
used here are restricted to the last but
one live birth occurring to ever-married
women. Thus, the sample of women is
restricted to those who were evermarried and had had at least two births.
In order to minimize the effects of truncation and recall biases, the universe of
women under study was further restricted to include only those women
who had had their last-but-one live birth
between 3 and 15 years preceding the interview. Such women comprise approximately 44 per cent of the women who
had had a last-but-one live birth in
Kenya (compared with a range of between 28 and 49 per cent for the eight
other countries used for comparison).

RESULTS

In Kenya, as in the other eight countries, the results are affected by the biases associated with the retrospective
nature of the data. Heaping of the reported durations of breastfeeding occurs in Kenya. In the absence of such

'Data for the eight other countries are from the
World Fertility Surveys for each country. The samples are restricted for analytical purposes in a manner identical to the restrictions used here. Findings
for the eight countries used as comparisons are
from Jain and Bongaarts, 1981, p. 3. Tables 1
through 4 of this paper replicate their analyses of
the eight countries for Kenya.

heaping about 16 per cent of women
should report the durations of breastfeeding in multiples of six months (Jain
and Bongaarts, 1981). In Kenya 31 per
cent did so, an indication of heaping that
is somewhat less pronounced than in the
eight other countries. Approximately 34
per cent of the women in Panama and
Colombia reported breastfeeding durations in multiples of six months; about
45 per cent did so in Guyana, Peru, and
Jordan; about 50 per cent did so in Sri
Lanka and Indonesia, and about 86 per
cent did so in Bangladesh.

The composition of women differs
greatly from country to country. Kenyan women are the least urbanized of
the women (about 16.6 per cent live in
urban areas) and Kenyan women are
the next to least likely to have attended
school beyond the primary grades (4.2
per cent in Kenya compared with 4.0 per
cent in Bangladesh). Kenyan women
are also less likely to have worked since
marriage than women in most of the
other countries (superceded only
slightly by Bangladesh and Jordan). The
pattern presented here is consistent with

281

the limitations placed on women’s roles
in Kenya where women largely derive
their status and sustenance through
their husbands and male children (Mott
and Mott, 1980).

DETERMINANTS OF BREASTFEEDING

It is not surprising that the death of
the infant curtails the period of breastfeeding as Table 1 shows. Durations of
breastfeeding are considerably shorter
where the infant died under one year of
age than where the child died later or
was still alive at the interview. In Kenya,
however, children who died after the
first year of life were breastfed longer
than those who were still alive at the interview. The pattern is the same in Peru,
Colombia, and Panama. If this pattern is
genuine, that is, if it does not simply
reflect reporting errors, it may indicate
that children who were breastfed for
very long durations were not given
enough supplements to provide adequate nutrition leading to higher mortality than for those breastfed for shorter
durations but who were given more ade

quate breastfeeding supplements and
substitutes. Some confirmation for this
thesis comes from the Rural Kenya Nutrition Survey conducted in 1977 which
indicated that children who were
breastfed late into their second year of
life scored lower on a health index based
on height, weight, and age than did children who had ceased to nurse by this
time (Kenya Central Bureau of Statistics, 1979). There is not enough evidence, however, to establish the direc
tion of causality. It is also possible that

infants who were sickly from other
causes were breastfed longer in the
hopes of improving their health.
Though there is a pronounced preference for male children in Kenya, this
preference does not lead to differential
durations of breastfeeding by sex of
child, as Table 1 shows. This also was
the case in the eight other countries.
About 10 per cent of Kenyan women
used contraception in the last closed interval (Table 1). They were the next to
least likely to have done so. In the other
countries the reported use of contraception during this interval ranged from 6
per cent in Bangladesh to 40 per cent in
Panama. Kenyan women who were using efficient contraception during this
interval breastfed for shorter durations
than women using no contraception or
women using inefficient methods. Previous research has shown, however, that
efficient users of contraception in Kenya
are a highly selected out-group of
women who differ from the general population in many regards (Mott, 1981). It
is not clear whether reported breastfeeding durations are actually related to
the use of contraception or to the other
unique characteristics of this group of
women. Women in Kenya who do not
use modern contraception may consciously breastfeed their children longer

in order to widen the intervals between
their births; or, more likely, women who
use modern contraception may breastfeed for shorter durations because they
are more likely to be urban, be highly
educated, and have modern occupations, factors which may also lead to

‘shorter breastfeeding durations in the

developing world. , .

. In Kenya parity and age explain less
than 1 per cent of the variation in durations of breastfeeding for both the total
study sample and the subsample of
women who did not use contraception
during the interval as Table 2 shows.
The direction and magnitude of the effects of age and parity on the duration of
breastfeeding varied considerably in the
eight other countries and were also able
to explain little of the variation. They
explained less than | per cent in Indonesia and Sri Lanka and explained the
most (almost 8 per cent) in Panama.

The effects of age and parity on the
duration of breastfeeding are also measured in a Multiple Classification Analysis (Table 3) in which mother’s education, place of residence, work status or
work place since marriage, and husband’s occupation are also controlled.
Data are presented for both the total
study sample and for the subsample of
women who did not use contraception
during the interval. Table 3 presents the
departures from the mean duration of
breastfeeding which are due to the various categories of the variables under
study both controlled for the other vartables in the analysis (adjusted deviations) and uncontrolled (unadjusted deviations). In Kenya, as in the other eight
countries, the adjusted deviations from
the grand means are small for each category of age and parity. The conclusion
suggested is that breastfeeding is not
used deliberately to limit family size.

all since marriage in Kenya, Jess than 15
per cent of the sample, are already a
selected-out unique group of women
much like those who report using modern contraception. As such, each group
of “working women”’ breastfeeds for
shorter durations than the general population of nonworking women. In addition, women who work at home (especially if some subsistence crops are
grown at home) may curtail their breastfeeding because they have better access
to breastfeeding supplements and other
food sources for their children.

The unadjusted deviations from the
grand means presented in Table 3 indicate that the higher the status of the husband’s occupation, the shorter the duration of breastfeeding in Kenya. This

_ effect, however, is probably due to the
wife’s educational level and her place of
residence (and perhaps other factors)
because it disappears completely when
the controls are introduced into the

variables. The child’s death before the
age of one, seven or more years of
schooling for the mother, living in an urban area, male sex of the child, and having worked since marriage are all assigned values of one and in each case the
alternative is assigned a value of zero.
A little over 12 per cent of the variation in the durations of breastfeeding in
Kenya is explained by these seven variables. This may be compared with a
range of about 4 to 5 per cent which was
explained in Guyana and Bangladesh to
31 per cent explained in Indonesia. In
Kenya, as in the other countries, an infant death significantly curtails the duration of breastfeeding. Similarly, in
Kenya and the other countries education and urban residence have a significant negative effect on the duration of
breastfeeding independent of the effects
of the other variables. In Kenya, as in
the eight other countries, the sex of the
child and the age and parity of the
mother have no consistent effect on the
duration of breastfeeding. Finally, having worked since marriage has a significant negative effect (independent of

the other variables) on the duration of
breastfeeding in Kenya, though it did

not in most of the countries studied.

A FurTHER ANALYSIS
OF THE KENYAN DATA

In Kenya, as in many of the other
World Fertility Survey countries, the
core questionnaire was supplemented
by country-specific questions which cannot be used in cross-national comparisons, but which can be very useful in further explaining the behavior of a group
of women in a particular national setting. Variables of particular interest for
Kenya are, for instance, tribal or ethnic
group membership, Muslim religion,
and type of union (polygamous or monogamous). One would hypothesize
that there would be variations in the durations of breastfeeding across the various ethnic groups determined by variations in cultural norms about
breastfeeding. One would expect Muslim women and polygamous women to
adhere more strongly to traditional values and to breastfeed for longer durations.

286

In order to examine the effect of
these country-specific variables in conjunction with the others in Kenya, a
multiple regression model was run with
duration of breastfeeding, measured
continuously in months, as the dependent variable. In the model (Table 5)
tribal membership is examined. Each
major tribe is included as a dummy variable. A woman is coded one if she belongs to the particular tribe in question
and zero if she belongs to another.

The other independent variables in
the model include two continuous variables, mother’s age at the beginning of
the last closed interval, coded as the actual age, and parity, coded as the number of children born to the respondent.
The remaining variables are dichotomous. Male child, Muslim religion, polygamous union, urban residence, being
literate, having worked since marriage,
and use of contraception during the interval were all coded one and in each

case the alternative was coded zero. In
addition, two variables indicating the
reason why a woman reported that she
stopped breastfeeding were included. If
a woman indicated that she stopped
breastfeeding because the child died or
because she became pregnant, she was
coded one on the particular variable and
in each case any other reason for curtailing breastfeeding was coded zero. Finally, the education variable was dichotomized into two separate dummy
variables, a technique that has proved
useful in previous research on Kenya
(Mott, 1981 and 1982). In the first variable, if a woman had attended primary
schoo] only she was coded one; all other
alternatives were coded zero. In the second variable, if a woman had attended
at least some secondary school, she was
coded one; and if she had less than some
secondary school education, she was coded zero.

The model suggests that the most
“modern” subgroups of Kenya women
breastfeed for shorter duration than do
their more traditional counterparts.
Secondary school attendance (though
not just primary school attendance), literacy, urban residence, and having
worked since marriage shorten the duration of breastfeeding. On the other
hand, being Muslim, being in a polygamous union, and having attended only
some primary school lengthen the duration of breastfeeding.

Membership in each ethnic group except the Kikuyu tribe and the Meru tribe
significantly lengthens the duration of
breastfeeding. Previous research utilizing this data set also found the Kikuyu
and Meru to be unique in their higher
propensity to use contraception (Mott,
1981).

Stopping breastfeeding because of
the death of the child significantly

shortens the duration of breastfeeding,
while stopping breastfeeding because of
a subsequent pregnancy significantly
lengthens the duration. The use of family planning during the interval has no
impact on the duration of breastfeeding.

In order to test whether the variables
measuring the reasons why a woman
curtailed breastfeeding or the variable
measuring her use of contraception during the interval greatly interact with the
other sociodemographic variables, the
model was also run with these three variables excluded. For the sake of economy this model has not been presented
in this paper, but the results suggest that
very little interaction occurs. The coefficients for the other sociodemographic
variables are altered only slightly, and
the patternsremain unchanged. In addition, there is no zero order correlation
between any of these three variables and
any other variable in the model greater
than 0.14.

CONCLUSION

Several indexes of modernization
suggest that Kenyan women are among
the most traditional of the women studied here. Kenyan women are among the
least likely to have attended secondary
school, to have worked since marriage,
and to have used modern contraception.
In addition, a larger proportion of Kenyan women reside in rural areas than do
any of the other women studied. In spite
of this, Kenyan women fall midway between the other groups of women in
their average duration of breastfeeding
(13.5 months in a range that extends
from 23.6 months to 8.3 months). Literacy, urban residence, secondary school
education, and modern employment
have a strong impact on the curtailment
of breastfeeding in Kenya. In addition,

the most traditional groups of Kenyan
women, those who are Muslim or who
are in polygamous unions, breastfeed
for the longest durations.

These findings do provide cause for
alarm, since the subgroups of women
who appear to be curtailing breastfeeding are growing in proportional size
or are composed of women who may
well be innovators and leaders. The
Kenya Fertility Survey suggests that the
subgroup of women with some secondary school education is growing considerably. For instance, about 19 per cent
of 15 to 19 year olds reported having had
some secondary school education compared with only about 3 percent of 35 to
39 year olds (Mott and Mott, 1980).
Similarly we can expect the urban subgroup of women to grow as the pace of
rural to urban migration accelerates. Finally, we might regard Kikuyu women
as innovators in many respects. In addition to having shorter breastfeeding durations, they are the least likely to be in
polygamous unions (Kenya Central Bureau of Statistics, 1980) or to want more
children (Mott and Mott, 1980), and
they are the most likely to be using contraception (Mott, 1981). One encouraging aspect of all this is that women who

are innovators in One area appear to be
innovators in others. The subgroups of
women who are curtailing their breastfeeding are the same groups of women
who are contraceptive innovators.
There is no evidence, however, that
these women use contraception to compensate for shorter breastfeeding durations. It seems more likely that a common cause, which for lack of more
information we can call ‘“‘modernity,”
lies at the root of both breastfeeding curtailment and contraceptive practice.
One can only hope that increased use of
contraception by these subgroups of
modern women will hold the lid on increased population growth. Similarly,
one hopes that women who breastfeed
for shorter durations also are the ones
who are more aware of health and nutrition concepts and thus are better able to
care for their children in the absence of
breastfeeding.
