Economic and Social Correlates of Infant
Mortality: A Cross-sectional and

Longitudinal Analysis of 63

Selected Countries

Although the demographic transition
theory cannot be considered a detailed and
refined “law of population growth,” the
basic postulates of the theory still provide
a useful framework for the analysis of the
interrelations between demographic processes and economic and social development. Infdnt mortality phenomena have
been analyzed from two different perspectives, both of which are largely based on
the general framework of the demographic
transition model. Attention has been given
either to the identification of the demographic, economic, and social determinants
of the levels and trends of infant mortality
or to the investigation of the demographic,
economic, and social consequences of the
levels and trends of infant mortality.

Previous studies have found, in general,
an inverse relationship between the levels
of economic and social development and
the levels of infant mortality. However, a
close examination of the findings reveals
that the observed interrelations are inconclusive. First, the extent of cross-national
interrelations among the variables documented in the previous studies has varied
Significantly according to the time periods

 

upon which the data are based (Ekanem,
1972). Secondly, Friedlander and Silver
(1967) reported that the degree of crossnational relationships found among the developed countries is different from that observed among the developing countries.

A more serious problem is that most of
the previous studies have been limited to
cross-sectional analyses, with the assumption that cross-sectionally observed relationships are applicable to the projection
of longitudinal relationships. However, as
Janowitz (1973) indicated, the validity of
such an assumption has not been fully examined in the previous studies.

The primary purpose of this study is to
analyze the cross-sectional and longitudinal
interrelations between infant mortality and
economic, social, and public health variables. Special attention is given to overcoming some of the conceptual and methodological problems included in the previous studies. This study is concerned with
63 selected countries. Three different sets
of data which refer to three different points
in time, 1958, 1963, and 1968, have been
collected for each country.

In the first part of this paper, we investi

gate the extent to which variations in the
levels of economic and social development
are correlated with the levels of infant
mortality. In the second part, by treating
changes in infant mortality as a dependent
variable, we attempt to examine the effects
of economic and social development on infant mortality.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Two considerations have been made in
selecting indicators of economic, social,
and public health conditions for each country. First, we adopted the guidelines on
“Gnternational definition and measurement
of standards and levels of living” by the
United Nations (1961). Secondly, among
those indicators suggested by the United
Nations, we selected six variables in view
of the availability of the data. These selected indicators are per capita national
income, per capita energy consumption,
daily newspaper circulation per thousand
population, population per physician, and
proportion of a nation’s population in
places with one hundred thousand or more
inhabitants.

In the cross-sectional relationship, a
higher per capita national income should
be associated with lower infant mortality
rates. A higher economic level of living includes a greater regularity in food supplies
and a better, more varied diet for mothers
and consequently the newborn infants.
Also, with higher per capita income, better
medical care and environmental sanitation
can be afforded. Insofar as the temporal
relationships are concerned, we assume
that the rapidity in the changes of infant
mortality rates is directly related to the
rapidity in the changes of per capita national income.

Per capita energy consumption was selected as an indicator of the level of industrialization. As Weller and Sly (1969)
pointed out, the replacement of animate

Social Biology

by inanimate sources of energy is one of
the most explicit characteristics of modernization. The changes in the sources of
energy for the economic production processes bring about the regularized mass
production of consumer goods and services,
including the goods and services essential
for infant care. Also, efficient distribution
of such goods and services is possible only
under the condition where the supply of
energy is sufficient. Obviously, increasing
regularity in the production and distribution of child-care goods and services would
reduce infant mortality rates.

An alternative channel of influence of
the level of per capita energy consumption
on infant mortality may be through its
effect on fertility. Freedman (1963) noted
that an increase in energy consumption is
generally conducive to a decrease in the
reliance on human labor, including child
labor, as a source of energy and also to a
shift from dependence on relatively selfcontained familial or kinship units to dependence on larger economic production
units. These changes in social structure
have played a significant role in lowering
fertility. It can be argued that a decline in
fertility causes a decline in infant mortality. With a given amount of resources
available for a family, parents with a
smaller number of children can provide
more attention, better nutrition, and better
health care per child (Heer, 1966, p. 440).

Although the independent channels of
interrelations discussed above are possible,
it should also be noted that the two variables, per capita national income and per
capita energy consumption, are highly intercorrelated both conceptually and empirically. For example, the zero-order correlation between the two variables in 1968
is 0.920 for the 63 countries considered in
this study. Due to this high intercorrelation, a composite indicator of ‘“economicindustrial development” is computed from
the two variables. The computation proceDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

dure of the indicator is presented in a later
section of this paper.

Daily newspaper circulation per thousand population is used as a measure of the
level of literacy. It is expected that the
provision of health care measures for infants is closely related to their parents’
educational attainments. We hypothesize
an inverse association between daily newspaper circulation per thousand population
and infant mortality rates. Previous studies
(Adelman, 1963; Heer, 1966; Ekanem,
1972) have found a negative correlation
between educational level (measured by
daily newspaper circulation per thousand
population, literacy rate, or a combination
of both) and infant mortality rates.

The availability of health care services
has a direct effect on the level of infant
mortality. Population per physician is
used as an indicator of the availability of
health care services. One may argue that
population per physician is not a comprehensive index of various aspects related to
health care delivery. With a given population-physician ratio, the actual availability of medical care services may vary according to the political economy involved
in the medical service system. However,
detailed information about the scope of
each government’s share in health care
services is not available. Adelman (1963,
p. 328) found an inverse association between availability of medical services, measured by the number of physicians per
thousand inhabitants, and death rates. In
this study a direct association is expected,
since we used population per physician
rather than physician per thousand population.

As Davis (1955, 1965) suggests, an increase in the proportion of population in
metropolitan areas is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the development
of a society. The urbanization process
brings about changes from traditional to
modern ways of life (Wirth, 1938), in
Correlates of Infant Mortality 317

cluding innovations in child-care methods.
Also, medical facilities and services are
more readily available in urban areas than
in remote rural places. Therefore, an inverse relationship between the level of
urbanization and the level of infant mortality is hypothesized. The level of urbanization is measured by the per cent of a
nation’s population in places of a hundred
thousand or more inhabitants. However,
some previous studies (United Nations,
1953, p. 62; Glass, 1964; United Nations,
1973, pp. 132-136) have found higher
mortality rates in urban than in rural areas
in some countries.

Although it may be true that mortality
rates were higher in urban than in rural
areas in most of the Western countries during the nineteenth century and the first
part of this century, that is no longer the
case. For instance, a recent study by
MacMahon et al. (1972) reported that in
the United States infant mortality rates in
metropolitan areas are generally lower than
those in nonmetropolitan areas. Arriaga
(1967) pointed out that in many developing countries at the present time urban
mortality rates tend to be lower than rural
mortality rates, if the differences between
urban and rural areas in the completeness
of the vital statistics are adjusted. Furthermore, the patterns of the urban-rural differentials in mortality observed from the
demographic history of the Western countries may not be applicable to the current
experience of developing countries (Arriaga, 1967).

The measure of infant mortality used
in the present study is the conventional
infant mortality rate—the number of infants under age one who die during a year
per thousand live births in that year. The
infant mortality rate is considered one of
the most sensitive indices of the level of
economic and social development of a society (Hauser, 1959; Stockwell, 1960).
However, many studies (Stolnitz, 1956;
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

318 Sh

Coale and Hoover, 1958; United Nations,
1963, pp. 10-11; Bogue, 1969, pp. 567—
569) noted that reduction of mortality in
many developing countries in recent years
did not require pronounced economic development. It has been argued that such
declines in mortality came about largely
through application of antibiotics and inSecticides, improvements in sanitary systems, and development of public health
services. Therefore, in this study we hope
to specify the relative contributions of
economic, social, and public health factors
to the reduction of infant mortality.

SOURCES OF DATA

The data on infant mortality rates were
obtained from the United Nations’ Demographic Yearbook series. The United Nations’ Statistical Yearbook series was the
primary source of the data on per capita
national income, per capita energy consumption, newspaper circulation per thousand population, and population per physician. The data on the per cent of a nation’s
population in places of one hundred thousand or more were obtained from a tabulation of the world urbanization data by
Davis (1969). For some countries, the
data on per capita national income were
drawn from the United Nations’ Yearbook
of National Accounts series. UNESCO’s
Statistical Yearbook series also supplemented the United Nation’s Statistical
Yearbook series for the data on daily newspaper circulation per thousand population
for some countries.

As pointed out earlier, data on each
variable were obtained for three points in
time, 1958, 1963, and 1968, for each country. One exception is the data for the urbanization variable which we were unable
to obtain for 1963. In order to minimize
the possible yearly fluctuations, the threeyear averages around each point in time
were computed whenever the required data
were available.

in Social Biology

There may be significant cross-national
differences in the accuracy of the data collected for this study. Furthermore, the
quality of the data of a variable for a
given country may be different from that
of the other variables for the same country.
Since the direct and specific information
about the accuracy of the data of each
variable for each country, which is necessary for any adjustments of the data, is
not available, no adjustment of the data
was made in this study.

used in classifying countries into two
groups. The European countries, Australia,
Canada, New Zealand, United States,
Puerto Rico, Israel, and Japan are considered as the developed countries, whereas
the remaining countries are categorized as
developing countries.

Previous studies (Friedlander and Silver, 1969, pp. 33-34; Ekanem, 1972,
p. 384) noted that grouping developed and
developing nations together tended to distort the relationships between economic
and social variables and demographic variables. Therefore, we have conducted a
series of statistical analyses of each of the
three groupings of countries: all countries
(63), developing countries (34), and developed countries (29). In order to examine the extent of the lagged effect of economic and social development on infant
mortality, a series of regression equations
between rates of changes in infant mortality during the 1963-68 period and rates of
changes in economic and social indicators
during the preceding five-year period,
1958-63, was obtained. Since the data on
the urbanization variable for 1963 are not
available, most cross-sectional comparisons
are made between 1958 and 1968.

A multiple regression model is used to
indicate the nature and degree of interrelations between the dependent and independent variables. We have computed the
standardized partial regression coefficients
(beta weights) to compare the relative importance of each of the independent variables in the multiple regression equation.

As mentioned earlier, a composite indicator of “economic-industria] development”

1 This arbitrary grouping of countries might be
inappropriate, since some European countries such
as Greece, Malta, Portugal, and Spain have significantly lower levels of economic and _ social
development in comparison with other countries
in the developed category. However, on the basis
of the fact that these countries have significantly
higher levels of economic and social development
than developing countries, we have decided to
include these countries in the developed category.

Correlates of Infant Mortality 319

was derived from per capita income and
per capita energy consumption. The factor
analysis technique was used to obtain this
indicator. The factor scores of each country were computed from three different
categories of countries, 63 countries as a
whole, 34 developing countries, and 29
developed countries.

RESULTS

CROSS-SECTIONAL INTERRELATIONS

Tables 2 and 3 provide the results of the
multiple regression analysis of the crosssectional interrelations. For the 63 countries as a whole, all the zero-order correlations between infant mortality and each of
the independent variables are in the predicted direction and statistically significant
at the 5 per cent level for all three points
in time, 1958, 1963, and 1968.2 An interesting finding from the zero-order correlation coefficients is that the degree of association between infant mortality and each
of the independent variables remains about
the same over time. Thus, it can be suggested that there exists a certain extent of
stability over time in the degree of association between the levels of infant mortality and the levels of economic, social, and
public health development on a crossnational setting.®

For both the developing and developed
categories, the daily newspaper circulation
per thousand population shows the highest
zero-order correlation with the level of

2 The zero-order correlation coefficients for 1963
are not presented here.

3Qne may argue that such observed stability
of correlation is largely due to the fact that the
coefficients have been computed at three different
points in time (only five years apart), suggesting
that the degree and direction of relationship between any given two variables would not change
significantly during such a short time period. However, in view of the substantial variations of
changes in the independent variables as well as
dependent variables, unless there had been systematic relationships between the changing patterns of infant mortality and the changing patterns
of each of the independent variables, the observed
stability of correlations would not have appeared.

Vol. 22, No. 4

both the daily newspaper circulation per
thousand population and the economicindustrial development indicator have statistically significant correlations with infant mortality at all three points in time.

The coefficients of determination (R*)
in Tables 2 and 3 indicate the extent to
which the independent variables jointly
explain the variance in the dependent variable. For the developed countries, more
than 60 per cent of the variance in infant
mortality rates is explained by the independent variables in both 1958 and 1968.
However, for the developing countries, the
independent variables account for less
than 20 per cent of the variance.

What are the reasons for the observed
difference between the developed and developing countries in the extent of variance in the levels of infant mortality explained by the independent variables?
Two possible reasons can be suggested:
(1) The extent of interrelations between
socioeconomic development and infant mortality may vary according to their stages
of development. (2) The quality of the
data on both infant mortality and economic, social, and public health indicators
of the developing countries is so poor that
the actual interrelations cannot be observed from an analysis of such data.

An examination of the signs of the beta
weights reveals some deviations from the
hypothesized directions of the interrelations between each of the independent
variables and the dependent variable. For
the developed countries, the beta coefficients for economic-industrial development,
daily newspaper circulation, and population per physician are in the hypothesized
direction, whereas the coefficient for urbanization is not. For the developing countries,
both the population-physician ratio and
urbanization deviate from the predicted
direction. The observed positive association between urbanization and infant mor
Correlates of Infant Mortality 321

tality in both categories of countries may
imply an adverse effect of ‘“overurbanization” on the level of health conditions.

With regard to the relative importance
of each of the independent variables, for
both the developed and developing countries, the daily newspaper circulation variable consistently shows the largest beta
weight among the four independent variables. In fact, only the beta coefficient for
the daily newspaper circulation variable is
Statistically significant. This consistently
high correlation between the daily newspaper circulation per thousand population
and the level of infant mortality may indicate that, as we have hypothesized, the
provision of health care measures for infants is closely related to their parents’
educational attainment. Previous studies
(Adelman, 1963, p. 327; Ekanem, 1972,
p. 394) also have found that the level of
educational attainment of a population has
an important effect on the level of infant
mortality on the cross-national level.

It is useful to offer one further explanation on the significantly greater contribution of the daily newspaper circulation
variable than the other independent variables on infant mortality rates. With a
given level of economic-industrial development, there may be significant variations
among the countries in the actual process
of converting such economic resources into
health care measures for infants. The daily
newspaper circulation per thousand population may be a variable that reflects these
variations among the countries in the conversion process. Thus, it is possible that
this variable encompasses a wider range of
factors which may influence the level of
infant mortality.

An explanation can also be suggested
about the observed insignificant contribution by the population-physician ratio to
the explained variance of infant mortality.
As indicated earlier, the population-physiDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:35 08 December 2015

availability of medical care services for a
population, since it may vary according to
the political economy involved in the
health care delivery system. Also, infant
health may be more directly influenced by

with changes in infant mortality rates. For
developing countries, none of the independent variables show a significant correlation.

knowledge of hygiene, rather than by the
availability of physicians.

LONGITUDINAL INTERRELATIONS

Our hypothesis on the longitudinal interrelations is that the rapidity of infant mortality declines is closely associated with
the rapidity of economic, social, and public
health development. As shown in Table 4,
all of the longitudinal zero-order correlations for the 1958-68 period are in the hypothesized direction. For developed countries, changes in the economic-industrial
development indicator, newspaper circulation, and the population-physician ratio
have statistically significant correlations

60 per cent of the variance in infant mortality changes between 1958 and 1968 for
the developed countries. Interestingly,
change in the indicator of economic-industrial development has the largest beta weight
(—0.847) and explains about 47 per cent of
the variance in infant mortality change,
while the other variables together add only
13 per cent to the explained variance. For
the developing countries, the four independent variables together account for only
15 per cent of the variance. However, even
for the developing countries, the beta
weight for the economic-industrial development indicator is greater than those for the
other independent variables.

As indicated in the discussion of the
cross-sectional interrelations, the daily

newspaper circulation per thousand population has the largest beta weight. Therefore, the relative importance of each independent variable in explaining variations
in the levels of infant mortality is different from its relative importance in the
trends of infant mortality. In a recent
study, Janowitz (1973, p. 480) noted that
the variables that have a major impact in
explaining variations in fertility crosssectionally do not necessarily play a major
role in explaining trends over time. In particular, per capita income, which is relatively insignificant in explaining crosssectional variations, has a significant effect
on the trends. It is interesting to observe
that, although different dependent variables are used (crude birth rate in the
study by Janowitz and infant mortality
rate in the present study), a similar pattern of inconsistency between the crosssectionally important variables and the longitudinally important variables can be
observed from both studies.

The reasons for the differences between
the cross-sectional and longitudinal interrelations with regard to the relative importance of the effects of each of the independent variables on the dependent variable
are not clear. One possible reason may be
that some factors tend to have instantaneous effects on infant mortality rates,
whereas the effects of other factors may
require a certain time lag. In order to examine the extent of lagged effects on the
trends of economic, social, and public
health development on the trends of infant
mortality, we have analyzed the interrelations between rates of changes in the independent variables between 1958 and 1963
and rates of changes in infant mortality
during the 1963-68 period (the lagged
effect model). Also, the results from the
lagged effect model are compared with
those based on the instantaneous effect
model which deals with the interrelations

Table 5 indicates that for the developed
countries the lagged effect model accounts
for about 33 per cent of the variance in
changes of infant mortality between 1963
and 1968, while the instantaneous effect
model explains only about 19 per cent of
the variance. Thus, for this category, the
lagged model seems to be more effective
than the instantaneous model. For the developing countries, the instantaneous effect
model accounts for about 14 per cent of
the variance, while the lagged effect model
explains about 17 per cent of the variance.
Although the lagged effect model is again
more effective, the distinction is less clear
than for the developed countries. For both
developing and developed countries, the

lagged effect model produces a greater beta
weight for the change in the indicator of
economic-industrial development than does
the instantaneous model. On the other
hand, the beta weight for the change in
the newspaper circulation rate from the
lagged effect model tends to be smaller.
These systematic differences between the
instantaneous and lagged models may imply that the influence of each of the independent variables on infant mortality operates in its own time dimension. More
specifically, economic-industrial development usually precedes social development
and thus the observed time sequence of
their effects on infant mortality may occur.
Furthermore, our findings here seem to
confirm the inferences derived by Sly and
Chi (1972) from their longitudinal analysis of mortality change in the United
States. An analysis of more comprehensive
longitudinal data may provide further information about the sequence of the effects
of different variables on mortality. Unfortunately, such comprehensive longitudinal
data are not available at a cross-national
level, particularly for developing countries.

SUMMARY

Using the demographic transition theory
as a basic conceptual framework, this study
has examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between infant mortality and several widely used measures of
economic, social, and public health development for 63 selected countries of the
world. The results of our analysis indicate
that there is a significant difference in the
relative importance of each independent
variable in explaining the cross-sectional
and longitudinal variations in infant mortality. The indicator of social development

Social Biology

is the most important variable accounting
for the cross-national differences, whereas
economic-industrial development is most
important in explaining changes in infant
mortality over time. Furthermore, the
effects of economic-industrial development
tend to be lagged rather than instantaneous, while the opposite is true for social
development. There are also consistent differences between developing and developed
categories of countries in the amount of the
variance explained and the nature of some
of the interrelations.

The findings of this study seem to provide important guidelines for future studies
on the interrelations between the demographic processes and socioeconomic development. First, the dynamics of the longitudinal interrelations cannot be inferred
from the cross-sectionally observed relationships. Second, it is essential to analyze
the cross-national data according to the
level of development, at minimum a separate analysis of the developing and developed categories, Finally, introducing more
direct and refined measures of economic,
social, and public health development in
a model would shed further light on the
interrelations. In this paper, a five-year lag
model was used mainly because of the limited availability of the longitudinal data
for different countries. In future studies,
special attention should be given to conceptual and empirical justifications about
the appropriate time lag of the effects of
economic and social development on infant
mortality.
