Further Possible Causes of Assortative Mating:
The Norm for Perceived Husband Superiority

Epstein and Guttman (1987), in replying to James (1987), state that “If
James means to limit his use of the adjective “‘superior”’ to scales of age, stature, IQ, education, and social class, perhaps he might present a more
convincing argument by empirically
substantiating it.”’ They go on to say “we
found no mention of actual differences—only correlations—between
spouses on these variables.”

My own work in a Cambridge urban
area (Mascie-Taylor, 1977; MascieTaylor and Gibson, 1979; MascieTaylor, 1987) does lend some support to
the notion of mean differences between
spouses for a number of IQ and personality variables. For the total sample of
193 husband/wife pairs, the mean IQ’s
(using the Wechsler WAIS test) of husbands and wives were not significantly
different. However, paired t-test comparisons of spouses’ IQ scores revealed
that husbands scored significantly
higher than their wives on both verbal
and nonverbal IQ components as well as
total IQ score. This finding was replicated in both blue- and white-collar
groups. These differences might reflect
husband superiority. Husbands in this
Cambridge sample also had significantly

 

 

more years of education than their
wives. Since IQ and years of education
are highly correlated, this result is not
unexpected.

Previous researchers have found a
sex difference when using the WAIS test
(Harrison et al., 1976) but no such bias
was found in this sample.

Finally, wives scored significantly
higher on the neuroticism scale of the
Eysenck Personality Inventory, but
there were no differences in extraversion/introversion or inconsistency
scales.

Is there not a case for determining the
role of sex differences in mate selection?
