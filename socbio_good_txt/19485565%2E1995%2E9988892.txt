ABSTRACT: A comparison of women’s and men’s performance in swimming, running, and
skating is made based on available world record data. The ratio of women’s to men’s record times
is analyzed as a time series, and the asymptotic value of this ratio is discussed in the context of
a model. “Rate of improvement curves” are defined over time and by event in a given sport and
are compared across gender. The relationship of record time to event distance is estimated and
also analyzed across event and gender boundaries. We make three conclusions: 1. The rate of
improvement for women has been extraordinary and is larger for longer distance vents. 2. Lawlike relations emerge for record times and event lengths. These relations have interesting physical
interpretations when examined for various sports. 3. The male physiology is more suited to
anaerobic strength events while, given increased access and participation, women can be ex
pected to be more on a par with men in some long-distance aerobic events.

As a social phenomenon, organized
competitive sports centered on competition between male athletes until the
last half of this century. The increased
number of events in which both men
and women participate allows for a
comparative analysis across gender
boundaries, which ts the subject of this
research. We examine the relative performance of men and women in events
of varying distance for swimming, running, and speed skating, and relate the
results to the underlying physiology of
the human body.

Many researchers have studied the
athletic performance of men; considerably fewer have studied women. This
statement also holds true for studies in
comparative physiology (see Keller,
1974, Ryder et al., 1976, Glick, 1978,
Mognoni et al., 1982, and Chatterjee

and Chatterjee, 1982, for mathematical and statistical studies of men’s
performance). Hill (1925), McMahon
(1984), and Alexander (1988, 1992)
give useful background on sports phys
‘1ology and the mechanics of loco
motion. Broad studies in comparative
physiology and the political and social
implications of gender differences are
found in Dyer (1982), Hubbard (1990),
and Wells (1991). One basic fact that
emerges from the latter studies is that
women have less muscle mass (and
overall smaller skeletons) than men.
These differences are due both to physiology and to the fact that muscle development and athletic training among
women is not strongly reinforced as a
desirable social and aesthetic value.
Social factors are treated by Bleir
(1984) as “part of the research design

rather than as noise to be filtered out.”
Our performance data span a time period where men’s participation is relatively stable and women’s participation
is initially sparse but then increases in
the recent past. This design bias, which
influences the availability and constrains the interpretation of performance data, is discussed where appropriate.

Our data come from two main
sources, The World Almanac and The
Guinness Book of World Records.
Since women’s participation has been
uneven, we lack data before 1970 for
swimming and skating. The situation is
somewhat better for running, where
we have performance results for at

of data is the primary example of the
design bias mentioned earlier, and thus
we have been duly cautious in drawing
conclusions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
ANALYSIS OF SPORT PERFORMANCE

For each event studied, the world
record data form a time series, where
for each year a data point 7, exists (the
record time during that year). Since
records are not set every year, we fill
in the intervening years with the most
recent record, so that the series decreases monotonically. Several models
are described that are used to fit various aspects of these series.

We begin with an exponential model
(Chatterjee and Chatterjee, 1982):

To =a+fe~* (1)

where T¢ is the record time for the i
event in the ¢'® year for gender G, and

Brief Reports

 

125

a, B, and y are constants. Here a is the
ultimate future performance time, y is
the decay rate, and f is the base value
above a from which the value decays.
For each event, we have data for n
years, so that¢ = 1,2, ..., ”. Since our
interest is in comparing men and
women, we actually model the ratio of
women’s to men’s times:

Ri= Tir / Tie (2)

The parameters a, f, and y retain their
original meanings under this transformation.

Another important aspect of the
data is the compound rate 7,, at which
the data values for event i decrease
over its observed history. This “rate of
improvement” 7; is estimated as the
slope of log(R;,) with t, fort = 1,2,...,
n. We construct rate of improvement
curves (RIC) that graph the relationship of r; with distance D; of the it?
event in each of three sports. The relative rates of improvement for women
and men are then examined.

Finally, we study the relationship
between current and world record
times and the distance of the events
across sports. This cross-sectional analysis gives us a measure for the effect of
the medium (water, air, ice) in which
the events of equal distance take place.
Our model is a simple linear regression:

E(T2)=a°+b° D; (3)

where E is the expected value of TY,
the current world records for gender G
in the it event. Within the observed
range of the data for swimming, running, and skating, the linear fit is more
than adequate. |

women’s to men’s time for each event
has decreased over time, and most
events show no sign of stability, as
evidenced by the lack of estimable
asymptotes.

The estimates used for constructing
the rate of improvement curves are
given in Table 2. In Figure 2, we plot
the rates of improvement against event
distance for swimming, running, and
skating. With the exception of skating,
which shows uneven behavior, the rate
of improvement increases for men and
women with increasing event distance.
The rate of improvement is consistently higher for women than for men
at all distances. Finally, for all events,
women’s RIC is slightly steeper than
the men’s curve.

CROSS-SECTIONAL RESULTS

Table 3 and Figure 3 examine the
current women’s and men’s world
record times for all swimming, running, and skating events against event
distance. The figure plot is formed by
joining successive points with a piecewise line segment. It is noteworthy that
the points fall virtually on six straight
lines, grouped in pairs for each of the
three sports, having different slopes
(measured in seconds per meter) and
intercepts. This finding strongly illustrates the effect that the medium in
which an event takes place has on the
velocity with which races are run. The
figure suggests an almost law-like relationship between the expected recordbreaking times and the distances for a
given year. In swimming, for example,

*The regression estimates of current world record times
against various distances for free style swimming, running (excluding the marathon events), and skating events are given along
with their estimated standard errors (in parentheses). The regression results for running without the 10,000 meters event is
similar. Standard errors are in parentheses.

for an increase of one meter in distance, the current expected times for
men and women will increase by
0.5963 and 0.6396 respectively. For all
three sports, we note that the women’s
slope is greater than the men’s.

We have also examined a limited
number of cases to determine how
these cross-sectional relationships between record times and distance of
events hold up over time. These cases
suggest that the relationship is sound at
any arbitrary point in an event’s history. For example, the regression results for 1981 swimming are given by:

E (T¥yog1) = 11.7762 + 0.6036D;
E (T¥\o81) = 10.0710 + 0.6396D

The estimated relationships are similar
to those observed for the current world

records. Women’s slope is greater than
men’s in 1981 by about 0.0360, which
is to be compared to a difference of
0.0433 for the current world record
data.

A useful exercise is to use the estimated slopes of the regression lines to
predict the time for an ultra long distance event. The calculations and other
details are given in Table 4 using the
marathon as an example.

From the above analysis, it appears
that for a marathon event, the: predicted average velocities of 0.1832 m/s
(men) and 0.1642 m/s (women) may
not be attained in the near future. The
historical yearly average velocity increase for the Boston marathon, for
example, are 0.33% (men) and 1.92%
(women), considerably below those
expected from the regression results.
Based on short distances alone, we
cannot accurately predict the results
for extreme long distance events.

DISCUSSION

We have seen in the previous section
the details of the data analysis. Here
we examine possible causes for these
results, In this section, results of our
time series and cross-sectional analysis
are consolidated and related to the underlying physiology of the human body
and to the social contexts in which
competitive sports take place. Many of
the results are a direct consequence of
the historical exclusion of women from —
athletic competition and the related
lack of training opportunities for those
women who do participate. In the recent past, this situation has been somewhat remedied, but the data still show
the effects of the bias.

*Since marathon times are so course-dependent, averages of the best marathon times for Boston and N.Y. are used to calculate

deviation from the prediction.

For short distance locomotion, the
ratio of women’s to men’s time is
greater than 1.10, closer to 1 for long
distances, with the greatest gains being made in swimming, skating, and
running, respectively. The increased
buoyancy due to women’s overall
higher fat content likely offsets their
smaller muscle mass and thus reduces
the ratio in swimming. The difference

 

in absolute times for all sports is smallest for shorter distances and increases
with longer distance.

The rate of improvement curves for
women are consistently higher than
those of men for all distances in swimming and running. This reflects the fact
that women have entered only recently
into most of the events studied. The
early history of an event is marked

 
Vol. 42, No. 1-2

both by rapid improvement in performance times and by large fluctuations
in the coefficient of variation of the
times (Chatterjee and Laudato, 1994),
As events mature (through broader
participation and increased knowledge
of training and event strategy) the
improvement and variation both decrease. Women’s events currently exhibit behavior seen in men’s events in
“the past.
& The record times follow an almost
Slaw-like linear relation with distance,
Ethe relationship being reasonably con®stant over the years. The men’s slopes
A (s/m) are smaller than women’s and are
Smedium dependent, with the largest
~-slopes for swimming, followed by skating and running. Since the estimates
=from which the slopes were determined
sare heavily weighted by short distance
‘events, these numbers simply reflect
‘Smen’s superiority in short distance
“= (anaerobic) events only. This superiorBity is mostly due to the larger muscle
“mass that men possess, but as with the
‘Eratios we note that women approach
men closely in the swimming events
zwhere muscle mass is offset by buoyancy. We have no data to test whether
‘the relationship holds at intermediate
distances (between 10,000 meters and
=the marathon), though the marathon
Aresults discussed in Section II.3 lead us
to believe that the linearity may disappear as event distance increases.

For most events, optimal levels of
performance have not been reached;
this is particularly true of women for
aerobic distances. Consequently the
asymptote (the ultimate ratio) is not
estimable for most events, though such
an estimate for many men’s events may
be obtained for the absolute time for
an individual event. This is again a

Brief Reports

131

consequence ot the smaller pool of participants in women’s events and the relatively short history of the competitions.

Finally, we have studied elsewhere
(Chatterjee and Laudato, 1994) the
distribution of the arrival of new records. The average number of records
per year is greater for long distance
events and is higher for women than
for men at all distances. There are several possible factors that influence
these results. Short distance events
represent the ultimate velocity attainable for humans and thus barring significant advances in training techniques, it is relatively rare that arunner
will surpass current times. Women set
more records partly because the pool
of participants is increasing in size and
event specialization. As their participation levels stabilize, the record distribution should become similar to
men’s.

CONCLUSIONS AND
IMPLICATIONS

The performance data studied here
is influenced by the size of the participant pools, the length of time an event
has existed and the gender of the competitors. Men exceed women in absolute time, but women show greater improvement across events. This fact is
related to the time history of the
events. The absolute time results stem
primarily from physiological differences between women and men, but
also because of the preponderance
throughout most of this century of
male-only sporting events. Because
women’s events are not yet mature, the
pool of women athletes is smaller.
Society still places greater value on

professional men’s sports and hence
fewer fiscal and training resources are
allocated to the improvement of women’s competition. Pure athletics is the
primary arena wherein these values are
shifting, as evident in the greater rate
of improvement for women.

There are many sports that we have
not analyzed and several other factors
we have not considered in the analyses
we do perform. The frequency of
records, for example, is determined
partly by economic considerations.
Setting a record involves greater physical stress on the athlete than just running a good race and winning without
producing a new record. Since athletes
earn money (through prizes and endorsements) based on winning races, it
is in their interest to increase the number of years they are viable competitors by minimizing the strain on their
bodies (Ryder et al., 1976). Of the

Social Biology

events we have not studied, ultra long
distance swimming and walking are
two where women have exceeded men
in some cases. The current holder of
the English Channel swim is 2 woman,
as is the record holder of longest minimally interrupted distance walked. If
such events were internationally recognized and sponsored, it is possible that
women would be comparable in overall
performance to men. While it is unreasonable to expect a women record
holder for lifting free weights, such
records in ultra long distance locomotion events are not only possible, but
have occurred and will likely continue
to occur.
