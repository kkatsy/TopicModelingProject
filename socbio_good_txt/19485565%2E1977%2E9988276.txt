ABSTRACT: Utilizing the 1974 Retrospective Survey data and registration data by Cholera Research for 1967-68 and by the Population Growth Experiment for 1962-63, this study attempts to
measure infant and child mortality levels in Bangladesh and to determine their structure. The
child mortality technique is used to convert proportions dead among children ever born to women
in the childbearing ages into conventional life table measures of mortality. Shortcomings of
present methods of measuring infant and child mortality in developing populations are discussed.

This paper attempts to measure infant
and child mortality levels in Bangladesh to
determine their structure by utilizing the
1974 Retrospective Survey data, registration data by Cholera Research, and Population Growth Experiment data. Among
the major problems encountered in the
exercise are the adjustment of the current
raw mortality data and the estimation of
infant and child mortality from independent source material.

The estimates of infant mortality and
childhood mortality are seriously hampered by the lack of reliable and adequate
information on infant and child deaths.
The existing source of information (Cholera Research Project, Comilla Kotwali
Project) are insufficient and can at best
give an indication only of the level of rural
infant mortality.

The tendency of surveys to miss a substantial proportion of infant deaths
imposes a further limitation on the degree
to which the infant mortality rate can be
reasonably estimated from the available
sources. The present study will therefore
be concerned with two main problems: (1)
the adjustment of raw data on the basis of
detected errors as revealed by analytical

methods and/or by the fitting of models;
and (2) the estimation of infant mortality
from independent source meterial, i.e., retrospective information on the number of
children ever born and the number surviving.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Cholera Research estimates of infant mortality for the periods 1966-67 and
1967-68 were 110 and 125 per thousand
live births. These figures seem to be serious underestimates compared to the Population Growth Experiment (PGE) estimate
for 1962-63 of 147 per thousand live
births, especially considering the fact the
latter estimate is based on national data
and therefore reflects a more or less true
level of infant mortality.

It is evident that infant mortality rates
are higher in rural areas than in urban
areas, although the magnitude of the differences is small. Males have a higher
death rate than females, as reflected in the
sex ratios at death. Neonatal mortality accounts for nearly one-half of the infant
deaths. Although there is tendency for the
proportion of infant deaths to rise during
the second half of the period under review,

exact times of rise and fall differ slightly
from one area to another or from one study
to another. The irregular pattern of proportions dead may be largely due to either
age misstatements or underregistration of
deaths.

It was assumed, however, that a large
proportion of the observed discrepancies
between the age composition of the infant
deaths was due to errors arising from age
misreporting. In the following section an
attempt was made to adjust the recorded
infant deaths by age by an analytical
model developed by Bourgeois-Pichat
(1952).

RESULTS

APPLICATION OF BOURGEOIS-PICHAT MODEL
TO INFANT MORTALITY BY MONTH OF AGE
According to Bourgeois-Pichat’s model,
P,,, the probability of death from birth to
age m days can be expressed (except apparently in the first month of age) in terms of
the following function

P, =a +b log} (» + 4),

where a measures endogenous mortality

Infant and Child Mortality 159

and b log? (” + 1), exogenous mortality.
The application of the method to both
Cholera Research and PGE data is presented in Table 1.

It can be seen from this table that the
curve of the adjusted infant mortality
rates falls very sharply during the first four
weeks and then falls more gradually
toward the end of the period. According to
the model, the proportion of infant deaths
at ages O and 1 should be 45.9 and 9.7
respectively. There is therefore a general
tendency toward understatements of age
of the one-month-olds, resulting in the
inflation of the proportion of deaths at age
0 months. However, if the omission of
deaths is strongly associated with age,
then the distortion of the mortality schedule may be partly attributed to omission
errors. This fact is difficult to demonstrate
with the available data, but it is commonly known that a fairly sizeable number of deaths of infants who die immediately after birth are missed.

While it is difficult to draw any meaningful inferences from the data presented
in Table 1, it is evident from available
information that there was underreporting

of infant deaths. In addition, since
Bourgeois-Pichat’s model can not detect
omission errors, as noted by Chandrasekar
(1959), it is very doubtful that it could
provide useful adjustment factors for correcting the distorted infant mortality rates.
Further, the model tends to conceal some,
if not all, of the basic characteristics of the
infant mortality pattern, e.g., an increase
in the proportions dead at ages between
six and eight months.

Several studies in the developing countries have also shown that the shape of the
infant mortality curve beyond age six
months is heavily influenced by malnutrition and infectious diseases (Gordon et al.,
1967). The Bourgeois-Pichat model offers
very little assistance as far as adjustment
for underreporting of infant mortality is
concerned. It must, however, be noted
that it could be a useful tool for distinguishing between endogenous and exogenous mortality.

ESTIMATION OF INFANT MORTALITY FROM
CHILD SURVIVORSHIP DATA

Demographic data in many developing
countries are still limited to that available
from a single census or survey. In such
surveys or censuses, the questions ask for
retrospective information from women
about the number of children ever born
and also about the number of these children who had died by the time of the
survey. From this information, proportions of dead or surviving children by age
of women can be easily calculated. Brass
(1968) felt that these proportions reflect in
a crude way the level of childhood
mortality. He developed a method by
which these proportions of dead or surviving children could be translated into
conventional life table functions. More
specifically, the technique is used to estimate the proportion of children ever born
who have died by ages 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, etc.,
from the proportions reported as dead

Kabir

Social Biology

among children ever born to women
15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, etc.

In the estimation of childhood mortality
by Brass’s technique, it is assumed that
age-specific fertility and mortality (especially infant and child mortality) have
remained approximately stable in the
recent past. It is further assumed that the
experience of surviving women can be
taken as representing that of all women
exposed to the risk of births and deaths of
children. The underlying ideas on which
the method is based can be explained in
the following way.

The proportions of children ever born
who have died are denoted by the term
D,, so that if standard age groups are
used, D, refers to the proportion dead in
the age group of women 15-19; D, the
proportion in the age group 20-24; and so
on. With the terms used thus defined, the
first step in converting D.. values into life
table measures is to examine the relationship between D, and q(t). The D, values for any age group of women will depend on two factors—the age distribution
of all the children ever born to those women, assuming that they all survived, and
the mortality to which these children have
been subjected.

The age distribution of the children ever
born is, of course, a direct reflection of the
age-specific fertility rates. However, the
explanation of the relationship between
D, and q(t) is rather complex for age
groups of women in the childbearing period. Nonetheless, its essence remains the
same; that is, for each D, some time
interval (t,.) will equate the values of q(t,)
and D,. For women aged 20-24, t, appears surprisingly small, approximately
two years, thatis, D, is roughly equivalent
to go. This finding reflects the effect of the
sharp fall in mortality during the first year
of life and the very gradual rise after age 5.

For a fixed location of the fertility
curve, alterations in the shape of fertility

Vol. 24, No. 2

will also affect ¢,. On examination, it was
found that for each group the calculated t,
values were approximately equal to a
whole number. More precisely, a rough
approximation was found between each of
D, and g;, Dz and ge, D3; and q3, D4 and
ga, and so on. These approximations were
closest for locations of the fertility distribution that revealed neither very late
nor very early starts to childbearing. In
the case of early fertility, the children ever
born to a particular age group of women
will be on the average older; for instance,
D, will be somewhat larger than g_. The
reverse situation will hold for late fertility.
But the amount of change in the relation
of g(t,) to D, as the fertility locations varied was found to be small. As a result, only
small adjustments were necessary to convert each D, value into q (t,), the probability of dying by the appropriate exact age
(in years).

Brass developed a set of multiplying
factors to convert the proportion dying
into the life table functions. The choice of
multiplying factors depends on four parameters: (1) the ratio of total children ever
born per women in the age group 15-19 to
that for the age group 20-24 (P,/P.); (2)
the ratio of children ever born per women
in the age group 20-24 to that for the age
group 25-29 (P,/P 4); (3) the mean age of
the fertility distribution (m); (4) the median
age of the fertility distribution (m’).

If more than one of these measures is
available from the population in question,
then the factors obtained by use of the
different measures will agree if the fertility
distribution of the population is exactly
the same as model. The first two indices
(P /P. and P,/P ;) indicate the shape of the
fertility curve toward the beginning of the
reproductive period and thus are particu-~
larly relevant to the younger women. The
last two indices (m and m’) are measures of
the age around which most children are
born and are therefore more important for

Infant and Child Mortality

161

the older women. Extensive investigations
have shown that the multiplying factors
give satisfactory estimates of child mortality despite differences between true and
model fertility and mortality patterns.

With regard to fertility, the small range
of multiplying factors, even with quite different values of P,/P, and other indices,
suggests that the factors are insensitive to
the detailed shape of the fertility function,
and this feeling has been confirmed by the
application of the method to a wide range
of populations. The only case in which
sizeable differences occur is in the 15~19
age group of women, which is because of
the great variability of the fertility patterns possible at the younger ages (even for
a given P,/P, value). Thus, the estimates
of g, are subject to considerable error.

Although the mortality model used was
a fixed one, it is important to realize that
exactly the same results would have been
obtained from any other life table in which
the level of mortality differed but the pattern remained the same. More specifically,
this comment applies to any life table in
which the g, values are some constant
times the corresponding qg, values in the
standard. Thus, using a single fixed mortality model is less rigid than it at first
appears, and only variations in the age
pattern of mortality will affect the accuracy of the estimates. To examine this
latter effect, numerous comparisons have
been made both with observed mortality
schedules and with other model life tables
showing a variety of patterns of mortality,
for example, the four mortality patterns of
the Coale-Demeny model life tables
(Coale-Demeny, 1966). The results have
shown that although estimates where the
age pattern of mortality differs from that
of the model will not be completely accurate, errors are small and unimportant
when compared with those arising from
other sources.

The assumptions made are that fertility
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:36 08 December 2015

162

and mortality have not changed recently
and that the experience of surviving
women is not markedly different from that
of those who have died. Changes in fertility are unlikely to have an effect in the
estimation. However, shifts in the age pattern of fertility might have an effect in the
estimation.

Table 2 reveals that errors in reporting
the proportions dead are fully reflected in
“qq values obtained by Brass’s technique.
Both a priori reasoning and general experience suggest that such errors, consisting chiefly in failures to report past events,
do commonly affect such data (Brass,
1968). If dead children and children still
alive were underreported by the same percentage, the proportion reported dead
would not be affected. However, it is more
common to fail to report the births and
deaths of the children who have died,
particularly if the event took place long
before the time of the survey.

It follows that reports of older women
might be particularly subject to bias, an
expectation that appears to be confirmed
by the figures of Table 2, which show
proportions dead reported by older women
that are somewhat higher than the proportions reported by younger women in
the same locations. It should be noted
that, whatever their reliability, older
women’s reports are heavily influenced by
the mortality conditions that prevailed

Kabir

Social Biology

long before the time of the survey. And as
noted above, the implausibly low infant
mortality rates shown in Table 1 are
indicative of incompleteness of reporting
on infant deaths. A comparison between
the computed /, values and those estimated from /, and /, (Table 3, Cols. 10
and 11) would seem at first sight to
indicate an improvement in mortality over
time and a slow decline in child mortality.

One would have expected that with the
substantial improvements in the health
services and medical facilities that have
occurred since World War IJ, the mortality rate should have been declining. It
appears therefore that the /, and /, values
have been inflated by the omission of dead
children. This omission could be more frequent among the older than the younger
women. The /, values, as implied by observed 1, and!, values, were calculated on
the basis of the comparable /, and/, values
in the Coale-Demeny West model life
tables (Coale and Demeny, 1966). The low
expectation of life at birth as implied by
the 1, values in the Coale-Demeny West
model life tables suggests that mortality
level did not improve significantly over the
period 1961-74.

Nevertheless, with the exception of Iq,
which is highly unreliable for several reasons (Brass et al., 1968), 2qo, 3¢9 and 5q9
give reasonable and plausible indications
of at least the lower limits of recent levels

of infant and child mortality. Furthermore, general experience has shown that
2qo is the most reliable of the estimated
probabilities of dying (Brass et al. 1968).

Accepting the estimated 2¢ 9 as fairly
plausible and also assuming that the
relationship between it and the iq, in the
model life tables is the same as that prevailing in the actual population, we estimated a new set of infant mortality rates
which is given in Table 4. The basis was
the Coale-Demeny West model life tables.
Estimates from the North model life tables
are also presented. The estimates from the
North family models show low infant

consideration. This finding is due to the
fact that the estimated /, values are probably not only biased by omission errors but
also by chance fluctuation largely due to
the small number of cases. In general,
however, the highest infant death rates are
found in the Chittagong and Khulna regions with relatively lower rates prevailing
in the other regions, except the urban area

which enjoys the lowest infant death rate.
The rural infant death rates are generally
higher than that of the urban area.
Table 5 shows both recorded and estimated child mortality rates defined as the
proportion dying between ages 1 and 4.
The estimates derived from both the West
and North models are higher than the
recorded 49, values, and in view of the
general underreporting of deaths by both
the survey and the registration system, the
West models appear to be inappropriate
for the determination of the levels of child
mortality for the population in question.
In all the regions, the child mortality rates
(based on the 1974 Retrospective Survey
data) are remarkably lower than the corresponding North models estimates. It is
quite possible that mortality rates of the
magnitude recorded in the North family
model life tables would indeed operate in
areas where the high infant mortality rate
is sustained through the second year of
life, and even beyond, as a result of malnutrition and infectious diseases. It can be
seen from the estimated infant and child
mortalities that Bangladesh’s mortality
pattern is characterized by high child
mortality relative to infant mortality, a
feature which has also been observed in a
number of other developing countries.
The regional child mortality differentials follow the same pattern as revealed
by the infant mortality rates and, in general, rural areas are experiencing the
highest child mortality levels, while relatively moderate rates operate in the other
regions. The survival rates are higher
among females than among males.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The child mortality technique is used to
convert proportions dead among children
ever born to women in the childbearing
ages into conventional life table measures
of mortality. This conversion is made by

the use of a table of multiplying factors
specifically devised for the purpose and by
taking into account the location of the fertility distribution in the population. The
most reliable estimates are those derived
from the reports of the younger women,
usually qo, ¢g3 and qs. Therefore, it is
primarily a method for estimating early
childhood mortality, and it follows that its
major drawback is that it does not provide
reliable estimates of adult mortality.

The method was designed originally for
populations where demographic data are
limited to those available from a single
census or survey. It has been very widely
used in such populations and has given
very reasonable results of child mortality.
Its application has also been extended to
populations where data is available from
two or more censuses.

Recently, various shortcomings of the
method have been noted, particularly in

Infant and Child Mortality

165

its application to the population where infant and child mortality are declining since
Brass (1968) developed the technique on
the assumption of constant mortality and
fertility in the recent past. There is evidence that mortality has been declining
sharply in many countries of the developing world for which estimates are most
needed. Finally, the multipliers with
which Brass mortality estimates are
usually made are based on a special model
life table developed for African populations. The question is whether these multipliers are appropriate in applications to,
for instance, Asian populations and, for
that matter, to any other population. To
what extent, indeed, do Asian or African
populations share a particular pattern of
mortality? How much difference does the
choice of model life table make? In order
