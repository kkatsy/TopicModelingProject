ABSTRACT: In the present investigation, it is observed that there are at least six endogamous
Mala populations namely, the Tangala, the Maladasari, the Pakanati, the Rampala, the Murikinati, and the Bommanati inhabiting the two taluks of Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh.
From the projected distribution of these populations, it is evident that the populations show a
regionality in their distribution, without any overlapping even when two different populations
inhabit the same village. It can also be inferred that the six Mala populations satisfy Wright’s
island model of breeding structure. These populations show low mean marriage distances.
Within each there is some degree of breeding isolation by distance, and there is an approach to

the neighborhood or, more aptly, the stepping stone model.

The present study aimed to obtain information about the nature of distribution of the population of the Malas, a
scheduled caste! population of Andhra
Pradesh, and the isolates contained in
them in different eco-cultural zones and
to ascertain endogamy and isolation by
marriage distance.

The Malas, one of the largest and
continuously distributed populations of
India, are found in almost every village
of Andhra Pradesh and the neighboring
states. The Malas, formerly “‘untouchables,’ occupy the lowest status in the
Hindu hierarchy. Generally, they live
outside the main village. They are poor
and depend on agricultural labor for
others. Very few cultivate their own
land.

1Socio-economically backward (untouchable)
castes were named as scheduled castes by the Government in 1938. (Issacs, 1965).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Samples have been drawn from two
taluks, Chittoor and Madanapalle of
Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh (Figure 1). From these two taluks, 10 per
cent of villages listed alphabetically and
numbered serially in the 1977 Census
Hand Book of Chittoor District were selected by systematic random sampling
assuming that these selected villages
cover 10 per cent of the Mala population
and form a representative sample of
each taluk. The first village was picked
by random sampling using the tippet
random numbers for each taluk separately. Afterwards, using this selected
one as the first village, we included
every tenth village in the list for this investigation.

A house-to-house census of the Malas inhabiting the selected villages was
followed by a systematic collection of
the demographic data through the construction of bilateral geneaological trees
or, more appropriately, pedigrees. The
information collected concerned the

available subjects belonging to the Mala
population in the area of study. Along
with the collection of data, the social
and geographical boundaries of the distribution of the population and marriage
distance of the couples were also gathered from the informants and also analyzed from the demographic data.

From the census data and other anthropological information thus collected, it is obvious that there are at least
six Mala populations in the area of
study. They are Tangala (TG), Maladasari (MD), Pakanati (PN), Rampala
(RP), Murikinati (MN) and Bommanati
(BN). Their distribution, sizes, and relative densities are shown in Figure 1 and
Table 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The demographic data and data on
marriages were analyzed to identify and
locate the endogamous populations belonging to the Mala caste in the area of
study. The actual occurrence of the particular endogamous divisions of the Malas in this area and their projected distribution as can be inferred from these
data are plotted in Figure 1.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE POPULATION

It is to be noted that the Mala populations identified and located in the two taluks do not exhaust the list of the Mala
populations of Andhra Pradesh. However, the nature of distribution, isolation, and spread of the populations in
the study area may be assumed to reflect
the general pattern of the demographic
structure and composite organization of
the Mala community. The available information about the centers of concentration and dispersion of the populations in relation to ecological and
cultural surroundings may also indicate
to some extent the general nature of the
dispersion of the Mala population ever
in other areas.

In the Chittoor taluk, three Mala
populations, namely, the Pakanati
(PN), the Maladasari (MD) and the
Tangala (TG), have been found to inhabit the ten villages surveyed. From
the nature of distribution of the populations in the villages of Chittoor taluk, it
can be surmised that the Mala community in this taluk is constituted solely or
principally by these three subdivisions.
Again, most of the taluk is inhabited by
the Tangala. The Tangala population,
which forms the major sample of the
present investigation, appears to be the
predominant group in terms of the area
of distribution, density, and size of population in the sample area, barring the
Maladasari.

In Madanapalle taluk, there are four
Mala populations, namely the Pakanati
(PN), the Bommanati (BN), the Murikinati (MN), and the Rampala (RP).
Here the Rampala form the major sample, but the sample is smaller than that
of the Tangala of the Chittoor taluk. It
can also be surmised from the nature of

 
Vol. 31, No. 1-2

data on distribution that these four populations represented in the sample villages are the only ones, or at least the
major ones, inhabiting the taluk, as far
as the Mala community is concerned.
From the distribution, it appears that
the Rampala is the predominant population in this taluk in terms of the area of
distribution and size. It is worthwhile to
mention that some of the villages had no
Mala population during the time of inwn vestigation. These villages lie towards
& the southern parts of Madanapalle taluk
‘pand are at relatively high altitude with
‘Esparse agriculture. It can be surmised
S from subjects that there are no Mala
A populations distributed toward the
oo
eS southern part of Madanapalle taluk.
+ From the nature of the distribution
“and the projection that is reasonably
Smade on the basis of demographic data
Sobtained from the villages (Figure 1),
Zeertain general observations can be
made about the nature of the distribu«tion. The populations show a regionality
pin their distribution. There is hardly any
Zoverlapping of populations even when
Ztwo different populations may someStimes inhabit the same villages and are
thus called sympatric. The Tangala, the
~gpredominant population of Chittoor taSluk, is located more toward south and
Seast, the Maladasari toward central
west, and the Pakanati to the northwestAer fringe of the taluk. The three (RP,
MN, and BN) of the four populations of
Madanapelle taluk appear to be limited
to the western region and do not extend
to the east. It is significant to note that a
small settlement of the Pakanati has
been met within a village on the eastern
border of Madanapelle taluk. It is posble to expect on the basis of the demographic data on their distribution and
location that the Pakanati population

Malas of Chittoor District 111

may be dispersed throughout the central
part of the Chittoor district and the limits of their distribution are represented
by the bordering villages of these two taluks. It is possible to support this hypothesis on the basis of the available
data on ethnic populations in this area.

It has been suggested by Thurston
(1909) that the term Pakanati is derived
from “Pakanadu” which literally means
“the land toward the east.” There is at
least one more population, the Pakanati
Reddy, which forms a major agricultural population of the same district.
Whether the term “Pakanati” has been
borrowed by the particular Mala population from the majority of Reddy or
Kapu, a peasant population from the
same area, or whether this Mala population has been known by that name from
earlier times, it can be logically surmised
that the Pakanati Malas are a population
who form the local inhabitants of Chittoor district. It is possible that the Pakanati Malas may have an even wider
distribution in the Chittoor district than
the Tangala or the Rampala which appear to be predominant in the area of
sampling.

ENDOGAMY

A total of 885 marriages have been
studied from the six endogamous populations (Table 2). All the marriages except 2 out of 551 among the Tangala and
1 out of 139 among the Rampala have
been contracted between individuals belonging to the respective divisions of the
Mala community. All of the three exogamous marriages have taken place
among the men of the respective Mala
population and women belonging to the
other castes such as the Kurava and
Chakali community (the washerman
caste). They indicate a small amount of

populations. The admixture is rather
negligible from the point of view of identifying the populations as endogamous
units. Such small exceptions to endogamy can obviously be expected to occur
in all populations and does not provide
sufficient evidence against considering
the Mala populations as breeding isolates. It is reasonable to expect a similarly small degree of admixture among
the other four populations if larger data
on marriages could be available for
them.

It may be noted that the exogamous
marriages have not occurred between
any pair of the populations under study
in the sample data and thus it can be assumed that the six Mala populations in

habiting the two taluks satisfy Wright’s
island model (Wright, 1969). There is no
preference for the other populations belonging to the social castes in the cases in
which social barriers of mating have
been broken.

Another factor which contributes to
the breeding and genetic isolation
within each of these populations is a
high incidence of matings between
closely related individuals. The frequency of consanguineous marriages for
six Mala populations range from 26.76
to 38.75 per cent. This considerably
higher frequency is due to their occupation as cultivators in the rural fields and
the fact that they are the least urbanized
and least educated population in this
area. Their poor economy and preferVol. 31, No. 1-2

ence for mates within kin groups are also
some of the reasons for this higher incidence of consanguinity.

ISOLATION BY MARRIAGE DISTANCE

Although the six Mala populations
identified during the investigation have
been treated as breeding isolates following the island model of Sewall Wright
(1969), the wide area of continuous distribution of these populations calls for
