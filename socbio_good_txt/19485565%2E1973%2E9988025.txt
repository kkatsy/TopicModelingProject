Effect of Changing Parental Age
Patterns on Chromosomal Aberrations

and Mutations

Ei Matsunaga

Department of Human Genetics
National Institute of Genetics
Mishima, Japan

Among a number of possible genetic consequences of family planning (Matsunaga,
1966), the effect of changing parental age
patterns upon recurring mutations, both
chromosomal and genic, is the one which
we can appreciate as of obvious “eugenic”
relevance. Here, the argument is based on
deduction from two empirical facts. First,
demographic data in most industrialized
countries show that there has been over
several decades, as a result of family
planning practiced by more and more
people, a gradual concentration of childbearing at younger ages than in former
times. This can be seen at once from the
decreasing proportion of older mothers, say
over 40 years of age, in vital statistics data.
Second, there are strong positive associations of parental ages with the production
of certain chromosomal aberrations and
gene mutations. Whatever biological mechanisms are involved in such associations
(for discussions, see Penrose, 1955; Vogel,
1961), the genetic consequence of younger
parenthood is beneficial because it lessens
the additional genetic burden that would
have arisen if the parents had borne children at advancing ages.

The purpose of this paper is to make a

$2

 

quantitative assessment of the extent to
which the changing parental age patterns
may bring about a benefit in terms of the
public health of a population as a whole.
Such an attempt has been made in several
countries (Matsunaga, 1966; Penrose,
1967; Vogel, 1967), but the major concern
of the authors was with the effect upon
the incidence of Down’s syndrome. Demographic data here used are taken from
Japan, partly because they are readily
accessible to the present author, but mainly
because they show distinctly the so-called
demographic transition which has taken
place during a relatively short period in
that country. As a more or less similar
tendency is seen in certain other countries,
Japan’s experience is an example which
may perhaps apply to many other countries where the practice of family planning
now prevails. It is assumed that the relative incidence by parental age of the
chromosomal aberrations and dominant
mutations under consideration have remained constant during the past decades
and that the mutation rates are the same
in Japanese as in European populations.
The few comparative studies so far conducted in Japan to estimate the rates of

Vol. 20, No. 1 Parental Age and Chromosomal Aberrations

chromosomal and genic mutations did not
reveal any racial differences in this regard
(Matsunaga, 1962; Tonomura et al., 1966;
Kikuchi et al., 1969).

SECULAR CHANGES IN PARENTAL AGE
PATTERNS

Table 1 gives distributions of parental
ages in Japan for selected years, for
maternal age since 1925, and for paternal
age since 1952 (when it was introduced
into the vital statistics records). The proportion of mothers aged 19 or less decreased from 6.0% in 1925 to 1.2% in
1968, and mothers aged 35 or more decreased from 20.5% to only 4.8% during
the same period. A similar change is seen
in paternal age pattern; during 1952 to
1968 the proportion of fathers aged 24 or
less decreased from 10.1% to 7.1%, and of
fathers aged 40 or more from 14.1% to
only 2.8%. The decline in the proportion
of older parents is particularly remarkable,
resulting in a decrease in the mean parental
ages of more than one year.

However, the most sensitive indicator
for the above change is found in the variance of parental ages. The variance for
maternal age decreased from 45.5 in 1925
to 17.8 in 1968 and that for paternal age,
from 45.4 in 1952 to 21.2 in 1968, Accordingly, the coefficients of variation
diminished considerably in both cases.

All these changes clearly indicate that
there has been in Japan during the past
five decades a trend, which began slowly
but later accelerated (with the impetus of
the Eugenic Protection Law issued in
1948), toward concentration of childbearing at mother’s age of 25-29 and at
father’s age around 30.

increase with maternal age is rather slow
until the mother reaches the age of 35
years, and then it rises almost exponentially as the mother approaches the menopause. The pattern of association has been
found to be the same in 11 countries
(Penrose and Smith, 1966), suggesting
that the underlying mechanism is purely
biological, irrespective of ethnic and cultural factors. Similar dependency upon
maternal age has been noted for Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY), triple-X female
(Penrose, 1964; Court Brown, Law, and
Smith, 1969), 13-trisomy and 18-trisomy
syndromes, but not for XYY and Turner’s
syndrome (XO) (Lenz, 1970). The same
situation seems to pertain to chromosomally
abnormal abortuses. The 45,X anomaly
and polyploidy are not age dependent,
while certain autosomal trisomies are commoner in abortions from older women
(Carr, 1967). There is, however, one notable exception, trisomy 16, which is not
associated with increased maternal age
(Polani, 1966).

Table 2 illustrates the relative incidence
for Down’s syndrome and sex chromosome
trisomies. Of all cases with clinical signs
of Down’s syndrome, the overwhelming
majority (93%) are 21-trisomy, for which
the rise of relative incidence with advancing
maternal age is even steeper, about 5%
are translocation type (D/G and G/G,
each with almost equal frequency), and
about 2% are chromosomal mosaicism
(Tonomura et al., 1966). As to translocation
Down’s syndrome, its occurrence has generally been believed to be independent of
maternal age, but a recent examination of
Japanese data on 102 such cases has revealed that the relative incidence for spotadic D/G translocation apparently declines
with increasing maternal age, while the reverse is true for sporadic G/G translocation
(Matsunaga and Tonomura, 1972). Pool

ing the two classes, the effect of maternal
age virtually disappears.

Applying the relative incidence figures
for each quinquennial maternal age given
in Table 2 to the data for maternal age
distributions in Table 1, it is possible to
estimate the relative decrease in the frequencies of Down’s syndrome (as a whole)
and sex chromosome trisomies, owing to
the changing parental age patterns. For
example, the relative incidence of Down’s
syndrome for the year of 1925 may be
calculated as follows: 0.40 * 6.0 + 0.61
xX 27.2 + 0.55 & 26.6 + 0.82 & 19.7 +
2.33 & 14.1 + 5.20 * 5.7 + 10.11 X
0.7 = 119.346. Corresponding figures for
the other years are obtained in the same
way and are given in Table 3 relative to

the figure for 1925. It may be deduced that
the incidence of these abnormalities must
have decreased by 30-40% in Japan during
the past forty years.

Recently, it has been reported that paternal age has an effect upon one specific
type of Turner’s syndrome, i.e., 45,XO/
46,XXqi (Lenz, 1970). Judging from the
limited data available, the pattern of the
reported association seems to be similar
to that found with respect te dominant
mutations to be mentioned later. The same

85

author also reported a positive association
of maternal age with one specific type of
chromosome deletion, 18p- (Lenz, 1970).
Since these two types of structural abnormalities are much rarer than the trisomic
conditions, they are less important in practical consideration.

Finally, one would ask if there is any
specific type of chromosomal aberration
which occurs in negative association with
parental ages. So far no such conditions
have been found, with the exception of
Down’s syndrome due to D/G translocation (Matsunaga and Tonomura, 1972). It
is possible that this type of Down’s syndrome is proportionately increased with the
changing maternal age pattern relative to
the 21-trisomy type.

PARENTAL AGE AND GENE MUTATIONS

In order to measure parental age effects
on mutation rates, it is prerequisite to
identify the individuals carrying a new mutation. This is possible for dominant and
sex-linked conditions, but not for autosomal
recessive conditions. There is some evidence
that paternal age, but not maternal age,
has a profound influence on the mutation
rates for certain dominant conditions, i.e.,
chondrodystrophy, acrocephalosyndactyly
(Apert’s syndrome) (Penrose, 1961), fibrodysplasia ossificans (Lenz, 1970), and
arachnodactyly (Marfan’s syndrome) (Penrose, 1961; Murdoch, Walker, and McKusick, 1972). An effect of paternal age
on hemophilia A has been suggested (Herrmann, 1966), but is not established (Barrai
et al., 1968). Based on the available data
(Vogel, 1961; Lenz, 1970), the pattern
of association with paternal age seems to be
strikingly similar and nonlinear for at least
three of the four conditions mentioned
above. Taking the overall incidence as
unity, the relative risk is approximately 0.5
for fathers aged 29 and less, then rises to
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

86 Matsunaga

about 1.0 for fathers aged 30-39, and about
3 for fathers aged 40 and more. Applying
these figures to the data for paternal age
distribution given in Table 1, the relative
decrease in the incidence of new mutations
at those loci may be estimated to be more
than 20% in Japan during the 17 years
since 1952 (Table 3). It is to be noted
that the corresponding reduction during
the same period in the incidence of the
trisomic conditions is of the same magnitude, i.e., 18-27%.

ASSESSMENT OF THE FRACTION OF THE
MUTATIONAL LOAD AFFECTED BY
PARENTAL AGES

It is now pertinent to inquire to what
extent our mutational load may be lessened,
as a whole, owing to the changing parental
age patterns.

It has been generally accepted that chromosomal anomalies are observed in about
10 per 1,000 newborn infants, of which
about 3.5 are of trisomic conditions that
are known to occur with increasing maternal age (United Nations, 1966). However,
recent surveys conducted in Ontario (Sergovich et al., 1969), New Haven (Lubs and
Ruddle, 1970), Boston (Gerald and Walzer, 1970), and Edinburgh (Ratcliffe et al.,
1970) have all shown lower incidences of
the trisomics (Table 4), the average being

Social Biology

about 1.8 per 1,000 births. While the figures vary considerably from place to place
owing to sampling fluctuations as well as
to different maternal age distribution, they
suggest that there may be about 2,000 trisomics per million newborns. If there occurred a change in the maternal age patterns
to the extent that results in a 30-40%
decrease in the incidence of trisomics as
shown in Table 3, this would mean a decrease by about 600-800 trisomics per
million newborns (in the course of about
40 years).

Further, it is known that 20-25% of
spontaneous abortions carry a detectable
chromosomal abnormality, of which about
40% are of autosomal trisomies (World
Health Organization, 1966; Dhadial, Machin, and Tait, 1970). If their dependency
upon maternal age follows the same pattern
as shown in Table 2, and if we assume the
frequency of spontaneous abortions to be
about 10%, then the number of miscarrlages saved, under the same conditions
set out above, would be approximately
1,000,000 & 0.1 & 0.2 ~ 0.25 & 0.4 X
0.3 ~ 0.4 = 2,400 ~ 4,000.

Turning to the effect on gene mutations,
Table 5 gives the estimated mutation rates
for three dominant abnormalities on which
paternal age effect was demonstrated; as

to fibrodysplasia ossificans, the mutation
rate is yet unknown. Adding the respective
figure for each of the three conditions, the
total mutation rate is about 54 per million
gametes, or sperm in this special case, per
generation, which corresponds to the same
number of mutant individuals per million
newborns. Again, if there occurred a change
in the paternal age pattern to the extent
that results in a 20% decrease in the incidence of these mutants as shown in Table
3, this would mean a decrease by 11 affected infants per million newborns (in the
course of about 17 years). It is to be noted
that this figure is the lowest estimate, since

there may be more loci whose mutability is
affected by parental ages.

CONCLUSION

The changing parental age patterns
caused by family planning have a profound
effect in terms of prevention of some genetic
abnormalities and spontaneous abortions
due to chromosomal and gene mutations.
Using Japanese data, it was shown that the
incidence of these abnormalities must have
decreased by 30-40% in the course of 40
years, or by about 20% during the past
17 years. Since they include relatively common disorders like Down’s syndrome, a
reduction of incidence of this amount by
family planning would represent a major
saving in medical care and in suffering.
While such effect appears only at the demographically transitional phase of the
population, it lasts as long as the change
in the parental age patterns continues.
