ABSTRACT: Unmeasured variation has long been a concern in analyses of the waiting time to
conception. Recent work by Heckman and Walker (1991) and Trussell and Rodriguez (1990) has
underscored the fact that statistical considerations alone cannot discriminate among likely
models describing the distribution. Here, we specify a single theoretically important source of
heterogeneity, namely variability in intrauterine mortality, and assess its effects on the waiting
times to a conception which results in a live birth. We find that the effects of variation in fetal
loss are confined to the tail of the distribution. Unless variation in fetal loss is extremely large
or a substantial proportion of observed waiting times are initiated at late ages, variation in fetal
loss does not appear to explain much variation in conception waits. We conclude that heterogeneity in fetal loss does not explain the variation in fecundability that has been observed for first
birth intervals. This conclusion supports the hypothesis that at early ages (below age 35) variation
in the waiting time to a fertile conception may largely reflect the proportion of nonsusceptible
couples in the population. The analyses suggest that for the purposes of testing theoretically
motivated models, future efforts should be directed toward examining reproductive experience
after age 35 and toward incorporating information on characteristics of the fertile period as it
becomes known.

the literature. In studies of fecundability, the probability that a woman in a

time (usually defined as a month), such
unmeasured variation has long been a
source of concern. Typically, empirical
estimates of fecundability are made indirectly from data on waiting times to
first conception. These empirical investigations have consistently shown that

time. How to model these changes has
been a continuing area of analysis. The
question, for example, of whether the
decline in the observed rates represents a decline in fecundability over the
reproductive lifespan (but with fecundability homogeneous among women at
any given age) or whether the decline
reflects initial population heterogeneity (with the risk of conception constant over time) has been the subject of
some attention. Data on waiting times
to conception alone cannot answer this
question. As Sheps and Menken (1973)
argued, “‘data on conception months
will not distinguish between two interesting and likely situations: (a) heterogeneous fecundability constant for

each woman, and (b) decreasing fecundability for each woman, or for an
appreciable portion of women.’

A recent paper by Heckman and
Walker (1990) underscores this concern. They reanalyzed data on waiting
times to first conception of Hutterite
women and concluded (p. 287): ‘“‘Many

work) which can help us choose among
models, or at least guide us in our exploration.

Indeed, it is one of the virtues of
models that they allow us to spell out
the implications of our theoretical expectations. First, we expect fecundability to vary across the reproductive
life span (and in general, to decline after reaching a peak in the mid- to latetwenties) on both physiological and behavioral grounds (Wood, 1989). Thus,
the finding that the Hutterite data are
consistent with the hypothesis that the
fecundability of each woman is constant may be of use in addressing the
importance of variation on conception
waits, or perhaps more specifically,
its importance at early reproductive
ages, but is theoretically untenable. A
second conclusion of Heckman and
Walker was that the data could not distinguish between a model? consistent
with the hypothesis that each woman
has constant fecundability and other
models consistent with population homogeneity and declines in fecundability for each woman over time. This second conclusion may guide us in our
assessment of the size of the effects of
population heterogeneity, but again,
because we know that there is variation
in both the physiological and behavioral components of fecundability both
among women and across the reproductive life span, we must reject a
model on theoretical grounds which assumes population homogeneity.* Finally, our theoretical models of the

biological and behavioral determinants
of fecundability allow us to specify and
explore likely sources of “unobserved
variation.” We need not confine our
modeling decisions to statistical considerations of goodness-of-fit. In this
situation, it is easy enough to agree
with Trussell and Rodriguez (1990, p.
112) that we need to “proceed inductively, by placing models at the intersection between data and theory, with
each informing the other through empirical results.”’

In our analyses in this paper we
specify a single theoretically important
source of heterogeneity in fecundability, namely variability in intrauterine
mortality, and assess its effects on waiting times to a fertile conception. We
explore the effects of heterogeneity in
intrauterine mortality on the distribution of waiting times to next fertile conception, isolating the effect of variation
in fetal loss from other sources of heterogeneity. We also incorporate our
theoretical expectations regarding agerelated changes in the components of
fecundability.

Our intention is to examine models
of fecundability which incorporate a
single source of heterogeneity in order
to assess the effects of that heterogeneity. Our interests lie in bracketing
the size of the effects of variation in fetal loss and in identifying where (if at
all) those effects might be important. If
the effects are negligible, then at least
for some purposes, we can use the
more parsimonious “homogeneous”
models for purposes of estimation.

In a population with homogeneous
fecundability, the mean waiting time to
conception is the inverse of fecundability. The heterogeneous case is more
complex. When couple-to-couple vari

ation (or month-to-month variation for
the same couple) is random (in the
sense that fecundability is always
drawn from the same density function), this same relationship holds, but
the waiting time to conception is the
inverse of the mean fecundability instead of a constant value of fecundability (Sheps, 1964). When, however,
there exist systematic and persistent
differences in fecundability among
couples, the entire distribution of waiting times is altered. The distribution
becomes more right-skewed, and the
mean waiting time to conception may
be increased substantially (Sheps,
1964).

When data on waiting times to conception have been analyzed under the
assumption that couple-to-couple heterogeneity is present and can be modeled using a beta distribution, large effects of heterogeneity on the mean
waiting time to conception have been
found compared with the homogeneous case (Table 1, adapted from
Leridon, 1977).5 In general, heterogeneous fecundability increases the mean
wait by 20 to 90 per cent. The studies,
however, do not estimate total fecundability because of the inability to detect
conceptions terminated by early fetal
loss.© There is, therefore, an unavoidable confounding of heterogeneity in
fetal Joss among women with heterogeneity in fecundability per se.

Several investigators have also suggested that there is substantial hetero

geneity in the risk of fetal loss (Leridon, 1976; Bracher and Santow, 1988;
Wilcox and Gladen, 1982). Sensitivity
analyses of the responsiveness of effective fecundability (the monthly probability of a conception that results in a
live birth) to variation in the level of
fetal loss suggest that it has a strong influence. Compared with a reference
population in which fetal loss is 300 per
21,000 conceptions, effective fecundcability in a “low” loss population (150
er 1,000) is about 40 per cent higher,
Ewhile i in a “high” loss population (600
Sper 1,000) effective fecundability is
about 60 per cent lower (Wood and
Weinstein, 1988). This sensitivity of efYfective fecundability to levels of fetal

Fecundability varies over the reproductive life span for many reasons.

Marital coital rates decline with the age
of both wife and husband, and with
marital duration (James, 1979; Kahn
and Udry, 1986; Kinsey et al., 1948,
1953; Udry and Morris, 1978).”? The
probability that a woman is simultaneously postmenarcheal and premenopausal is highly age-dependent (Treloar, 1974). Ovarian cycles change in
both length and quality with age. At
very early and late reproductive ages,
cycles tend to be longer and more variable in length, and they are often anovulatory (Treloar et al., 1967). During the first few years following menarche, they also tend to be characterized by short or insufficient luteal
phases (Lenten et al., 1984a,b). Aspects of ovarian function may simultaneously affect the probability of conception and the probability of fetal
loss, making their effects on birth intervals difficult to unravel. For example, luteal sufficiency is a primary requirement for maintaining a pregnancy
during its earliest stages, so this factor
should influence the level of early fetal
loss. It is also an important determinant of total fecundability because of
its effects on cycle length. Overall,
there 1s now general agreement that effective fecundability varies systematically with the age of the female partner, rising rapidly to a peak during the
early 20’s then declining slowly to the
age of menopause (Bendel and Hua,
1978; Others).

7Unlike previous investigators, Jasso (1985,
1986) found that coital frequency increased with
wife’s age. Kahn and Udry (1986) have argued that
her results stem from the inclusion of possible miscoded data and outliers and the omission of a significant interaction effect.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

EFFECTS OF HETEROGENEITY IN
INTRAUTERINE MORTALITY ON THE
DISTRIBUTION OF WAITING TIMES TO
NEXT FERTILE CONCEPTION

We begin by isolating the effects of
variation in the risk of fetal loss on the
waiting time to a fertile conception,
i.e., a conception that results in a live
birth. We contrast two cases: (1) one in
which there is systematic variation in
couple-to-couple probabilities of fetal
loss at each age, with (2) a case in
which the probability of fetal loss is homogeneous among couples at each age.
In both cases the probability of fetal
loss varies across ages, as do the remainder of the physiological characteristics and coital frequency.

In view of the empirical difficulties
outlined above, our analyses are based
on a mathematical model of the determinants of fecundability. This model
allows us to control for heterogeneity
in factors affecting fecundability but
unrelated to fetal loss. We use life table
estimates of waiting time to a fertile
conception to assess the effects of heterogeneity in the risk of fetal loss. The
motivation for using life tables is first,
that the distribution of waiting times to
conception is extremely right-skewed,
regardless of whether fecundability is
homogeneous or heterogeneous. Thus,
the mean—the measure presented in
most analyses—is not likely to be a
good measure of central tendency. Second, the risk of conception varies with
age. Consequently, the mean waiting
time to conception based on fecundability at any one age does not incorporate the effects of declines in fecundability at later ages during the same
conception wait. Because mean wait

ing times in the heterogeneous case are
high at older ages and typically increase with age, the additional effects
of expected declines in fecundability
could have substantial effects.

We consider two scenarios—one in
which the variance in fetal loss is constant with maternal age, and the other
in which the variance is itself a positive
function of the mean risk of loss and
therefore increases with maternal age
(ignoring adolescent pregnancies).
Based on current evidence, it is uncertain which of these two scenarios is biologically more realistic.

Within each scenario we analyze
four cases, ranging from low to high
variance as shown in Table 1. For midreproductive age women, the estimates
of the variance made by Leridon
(1976) from French data, and by Santow and Bracher (1988) from Australian data, fall near the middle of this
range. We consider it likely, therefore,
that our sensitivity analyses bracket the
“true” variance in the risk of loss.2 We
also compare effective fecundability

8Each scenario is the same as the one used in our
earlier work which focused on mean fecundability
(Wood and Weinstein, 1990). These earlier analyses
had two problems which are addressed here (we also
address the more general question of the effects of
heterogeneity on the distribution of waiting times in
this paper). First, as discussed above, for a skewed
distribution, the mean may not be a good measure
of central tendency. Thus, while our exploratory
analyses showed that heterogeneity in fetal loss increases the ratios of expected waiting times, the
waiting times themselves are all within six months as
late as age 35 and do not increase sharply until age
45. Second, the assumption that subsequent agespecific fecundability remains constant that was
made in calculating the expected waiting times provides estimates that are too low, because effective
fecundability declines after age 25. In order to assess
the additional effects of age-related declines in fecundability, we turn to life-table techniques that allow us to estimate the distributions of waiting times
for both the heterogeneous and homogeneous cases
and compare them directly.

by several studies (Alberman, 1987;
Harlap et al., 1980; Wilcox et al.,
1981), the mean or expected probability of loss is allowed to vary by maternal age. The mean risk of fetal loss at
each maternal age follows the curve
shown in Figure 1, which we have estimated from data on nine populations
in which induced abortion Is not a competing risk (Wood and Weinstein,
1988). The level of this curve corresponding to maternal age 23 has been
adjusted upwards to 0.3, consistent
with recent estimates based on assays
of urinary chorionic gonadatropin
(Wilcox et al., 1988), and the rest of
the curve is then allowed to vary in parallel with the curve in Figure 1. Because an elevation in mean risk of loss
among adolescents is not a universal
finding of population-based studies
(Santow and Bracher, 1988), we restrict attention to maternal ages 20 and
above.

In order to model the effects of heterogeneity at each age in the risk of
fetal loss, we assume that the probability of loss follows a beta distribution
among women at each maternal age.
This distribution, which was used for
similar purposes by Leridon (1976),
Wilcox and Gladen (1982), and Santow
and Bracher (1988), was chosen because it is flexible and because it constrains the value of p to lie between

separately by maternal age. Given that the proportion of spontaneous abortions attributable to chromosomal aberrations is thought to increase with maternal age (Hassold et al., 1984), and that they
generally terminate pregnancies early, tf may actually decrease with age. If t does increase with age,
the result might be to offset partially the known increased risk of loss. More generally, in this paper we
confine our attention to the effects of variability in
the risk of fetal loss. The effects of variability in ¢
among couples or across ages (as noted above) are
not incorporated.

case, it is the variance of the beta distribution which we allow to vary at
each age and whose impact on the waiting time we assess. We constrain the
mean to be the same as the mean at
each age in the homogeneous case.
To estimate waiting times in the heterogeneous case, we need to extend
Equation (1) because that equation is
based on the assumption that fecundability is homogeneous at each age. We
do this by modeling variation in the

Equation (1) to compute effective fecundability separately for each percentile of the beta distribution, as if couples corresponding to that percentile
were homogeneous. We then apply
life-table methods to compute the
overall distribution of waiting times to
conception by using monthly probabilities of conception for each percentile
and aggregating at the end of each
month. For each percentile, effective
fecundability is assumed to be constant
during each year of maternal age, but
changes at the end of each twelvemonth period according to the predicted distribution at each maternal
age.

In both the heterogeneous and homogeneous cases, the remaining components of the model, those not pertaining to fetal loss, follow the age
patterns that have been observed in
normal, healthy Western women (see
Wood and Weinstein, 1988; Wood,
1989). None of the components unrelated to fetal loss is allowed to vary
from its expected value apart from the
2 predicted changes with maternal age.

In summary, for the homogeneous
case, all values are fixed at their expected levels for each maternal age.
No heterogeneity in the risk of fetal

RESULTS

As shown in Table 2, the introduction of variation in the risk of fetal
loss has little effect on the number of
months to conception required for
each quartile of the distribution up to
age 40.!2 Even for intervals beginning
as late as age 45, the difference between the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases in the median time re

quired for women to conceive is at
most one month.

Under the constant variance scenario, at all levels of variance at intrauterine mortality, the times to conception at all ages for each quartile differ
little from the case in which there is no
variation in fetal loss (i.e., the case in
which fecundability is homogeneous).
At most ages, the times to conception
for each quartile in the heterogeneous
cases differ from the homogeneous
case by less than one month. In only
one instance (age 45, constant variance = 0.02) does the time differ by as
much as two months.

Even under the scenario in which
the variance changes with age, large
differences in months to conception for
each quartile are not observed until
age 45. Only above age 45 do waiting
times for conception differ from the
homogeneous case by more than one
month. !3

Percentages conceiving by the end
of one, three, and five years for the
cases of heterogeneous mortality differ
only slightly from the homogeneous
case (data not shown). Under the constant variance scenario, there are only
very small differences in the percentages conceiving by the end of any year

13At high variances, the beta distribution of fetal
loss itself becomes U-shaped, with the highest densities near zero and one (Johnson and Kotz, 1970).
This result suggests that the functional form of the
variance in fetal loss may itself vary with age or with
the level of fetal loss. Given the absence of empirical
evidence on this point, an accurate choice for such
a function is not possible. For these analyses, the
U-shaped curves at the oldest ages under the changing variance scenario result in an estimate which is
a lower bound on the effects of very high variation.
They also account for declines in waiting times at
ages 50 and above at the higher levels of variance.
Because mean fecundability is quite low at the highest ages (0.11 at age 45, 0.02 at age 50, and 0.0002
at age 55) the overall effects on waiting times to conception are quite small.

heterogeneity in intrauterine mortality
has little effect on the percentages conceiving compared with the homogeneous case up to age 35. At age 45, the
percentage conceiving within one year
ranges from just above 75 per cent in
the homogeneous case down to 61 per

cent in the highest variance heterogeneous case, a difference of 14 per cent.
This spread increases with additional
exposure. At the end of five years, the
percentage conceiving in the homogeneous case is close to 99 per cent while
it is 77 per cent in the heterogeneous

case; but in all cases, at least threequarters of the women have conceived
by the end of five years.

These findings suggest that below
age 35, it would be difficult indeed to
discriminate between homogeneous
and heterogeneous fetal loss from empirical data by examining its effects on
the cumulative probability of conceiving at an interval of one year or later.
At older ages, it would be possible to
distinguish heterogeneous risks of fetal
loss from the homogeneous case only if
the variance is large and increases with
age.

We examine the differences at durations up to two years in Table 3, presenting the percentages who have not
had a fertile conception by six-month
intervals. For women beginning conception waits below age 35, only small
differences—less than about two percentage points—are evident between
the homogeneous and heterogeneous
cases. At the end of six months, the
largest difference in the proportions
conceiving is 2.09 per cent or about 14
per cent of the proportion who would
have conceived if fecundability were
homogeneous (observed in the constant variance equal to 0.02 scenario at
age 30). By month 12, the differences
are all below 2 per cent (again, the
largest, 1.91 per cent is observed at age
30, under a constant variance equal to
0.02). By month 18, all differences are
below 1 per cent, and by month 24,
none is larger than one-half of 1 per
cent. While these later differences, at
least in some instances represent large
proportions relative to the homogeneous case,!4 the fact that the absolute

14Under the scenario in which fetal loss is heterogeneous with a constant variance of 0.02, for ex

differences are so small implies that it
would be virtually impossible to detect
them empirically from any but the very
largest of surveys.

An important result is that prior to
age 35, under any scenario, nearly all
women have conceived by the end of
24 months according to our model;
0.51 per cent is the highest percentage
not conceiving by the end of the period. Thus, in the absence of pathological sterility (or some other infecundable condition), virtually all women
who begin conception waits prior to
age 35 conceive within two years.

For conception waits beginning after age 35, absolute differences between the percentages conceiving in
the homogeneous and heterogeneous
cases increase, but the relative differences correspondingly decrease. As
noted earlier, at ages 40 and below, 90
per cent of all conception waits are
closed within three years, and even for
waits beginning between ages 40 and
45, virtually all end in conceptions
within five years.

Because the cumulative proportions
conceiving may tend to obscure differences at discrete intervals, we also examine the full distribution of waiting
times. How is the distribution of waiting times affected by heterogeneity in
fetal loss? These distributions are displayed in Figures 2 through 5 for ages
20, 30, 40 and 50, respectively.15 The
distributions of the lowest and highest
variance cases for each heterogeneous
scenario are plotted along with the dis
ample, we expect that at age 30 only 0.51 per cent
of women will not have conceived by the end of 24
months, while 0.01 per cent under the homogeneous
scenario would not have conceived.

In each figure, the constant variation scenario
is shown in the top frame, the changing variance scenario is shown in the lower frame.

EFFECTS OF HETEROGENEITY IN

FECUNDABILITY ON THE DISTRIBUTION
OF WAITING TIMES TO CONCEPTION

The first analyses suggest that at
early reproductive ages—up to age 35
—an important potential source of
heterogeneity in fecundability has little

effect on the distribution of waiting
times to conception. This result leads
to a more general question: How large
are the effects of heterogeneity from
all sources taken together on waiting
times to conception? Several investigators have modeled the effects of heterogeneity under the assumption that apparent or effective fecundability itself,
not fetal loss, follows a beta distribution among couples. Results from several of these studies are summarized in
Table 4. As seen from the last column
of Table 4, the ratio of expected waiting times when fecundability is heterogeneous to that when it is homogeneous ranges from 1.20 to 1.91. The
ratio of the variance of the waiting
times ranges from just over 2.5 to
nearly 12.!7 These ratios seem to imply
large effects of heterogeneity on the
waiting times. But what do the survival
curves and waiting time distributions
look like for these estimates?!8

We calculated the distribution of
waiting times for sources shown in
Table 4 using the mean and variance as
given by Leridon (1977). In order to
capture the effects of age-related
changes in fecundability across the reproductive lifespan, we treat all conception waits as beginning at age 20,19
and correct for age-specific changes in

17Note that the ratio of expected waiting times
here compares populations with the same mean initial fecundability. In the previous analyses we introduce heterogeneity in fetal loss (keeping the
mean value of fetal loss the same for the heterogeneous and homogeneous populations) and compare
the waiting times resulting from their implied fecundabilities.

18We must use the beta distribution for comparative purposes. It is the one that has been most commonly used. The results of Heckman and Walker
(1990) suggest that the choice of function does not
greatly affect the results.

19The mean age at marriage for the Hutterite
(Majumdar and Sheps, 1970) sample is about 19.95.

across ages corresponds to the per cent

For the heterogeneous case, we assume that fecundability*® is described
by a beta distribution at each maternal
age with a mean at age 20 equal to the
mean show in Table 4 (and corrected at
subsequent ages as discussed above),
and with a constant variance over
the subsequent period equal to the
variance shown in Table 4. Again, we
estimate effective fecundability separately for each percentile. The distribution of waiting times is computed using life-tables calculated separately for
each percentile of the population (per
month) and aggregated at the end of
each month. As in the case in which the
risk of fetal loss followed a beta function, we assume that the risk of a fertile
conception during each year of mater

recognizable, apparent, and effective fecundability
(see Table 4). We have excluded the estimates for
the Henry data because his estimates are based on
the first months following marriage. Also excluded
are the estimates from Berquo et al. (1968) which
may have included sterile couples.

nal age is constant, but changes at the
end of each 12-month period according
to the predicted distribution at each
maternal age. These analyses differ
from the previous set because in this
case, it is fecundability itself, not the
risk of fetal loss which has a beta distribution.

We first examine the survival curve
based on the Hutterite data (Majumdar and Sheps, 1970) shown in the top
panel of Figure 6.2! In both the homo

per cent of the women have conceived
within 3 months, 75 per cent within 9
months, and over 95 per cent within
18 months. After Month 16, in both
the homogeneous and heterogeneous
cases, less than 1 per cent of all conceptions occur in any given month
(lower panel of Figure 6).

The differences between the heter~bgeneous and homogeneous cases are
Sexamined in Figure 7. The top panel

0.14 to 0.25—a reasonable range for

the data used by Heckman and Walker (1990), they
therefore necessarily exclude women in a nonsusceptible state owing to pathological sterility.

22Because we are modeling populations with
equal initial mean fecundability, the proportions
conceiving (apart from our error tolerance in estimating the beta distribution) during the first month
are the same in the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases.

first birth intervals. The top panel
shows that the differences in the survival function increase rapidly during
the first year, then decline slowly. After about four years (50 months), none
of the differences exceeds 2 per cent.
The maximum difference in each case
is below 8 per cent and occurs within
the first year and a half following the
start of the conception wait. Differences in the monthly proportions conceiving are quite small, with the exception of only a few months, less than
one-half of 1 percentage point separates the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. These differences are
most apparent in the first few months
following onset of exposure.

DISCUSSION

We focused on how heterogeneity in
fetal loss affects the distribution of
waiting times to conception. Based on
our earlier work, we had anticipated
that variation in fetal loss would have
a large effect for two reasons. First,
because we had found that effective
fecundability was highly sensitive to
the level of fetal loss (Wood and Weinstein, 1988); and second, because heterogeneity in fetal loss has a large
effect on the variance in effective fecundability (Wood and Weinstein,
1990).

The results of our first analyses show
that the effects of variation in fetal loss
on the distribution of waiting times to
conception are primarily confined to
the tail (indeed to the extreme tail) of
the distribution. Unless variation in fetal loss is extremely large or a substantial proportion of observed waiting
times are initiated at late ages, variation in fetal loss within any age group

does not appear to explain much variation in conception waits. Our modeling shows that the effects of heterogeneity in fetal loss on waiting times to
conception are greatest at the older reproductive ages (age 35 and above)
when fecundability is lowest. Because
most empirical studies of fecundability
have been based on first intervals, consequently on intervals beginning at
younger ages, we conclude that hetereogeneity in fetal loss does not explain
athe variation in fecundability that has
Seen observed for first intervals.
3 Other factors that may have an imChortant effect on the variation in fe<tundability are the length of the fertile
“period and the probability of concep“tion during the fertile period, given
‘that sexual intercourse has occurred.
There has been some past disagree‘Ament regarding estimates for these factors (Bongaarts, 1983; Royston, 1982).
«Ongoing work by Allen Wilcox and his
passociates may provide some guidance
or modeling these components of fe-cundability in the near future.
> So far, though, our results suggest
phat at early ages variation in effective
fecundability may largely reflect the
proportion of nonsusceptible couples
‘Sn the population.?3 This conclusion is
in agreement with the results of HeckCman and Walker’s (1991) empiricallybased modeling exercise.

Other evidence supports this interpretation as well. We expect fecundability to be approximately constant
between ages 20 and 30 (Wood and
Weinstein, 1988). If the population

is not a factor. Therefore, these couples are likely to
be sterile or possibly not reporting the use of contraception.

were homogeneous with respect to fecundability at each age, only small
changes in the distribution of waiting
times would be caused by the changes
in fecundability across ages. Similarly
if fecundability varies across age, but is
homogeneous at any given age, only
small differences are found in comparison with the case in which it both varies across age and within the population. Our second set of simulations
illustrates this point. When fecundability at early ages is homogeneous across
women but declines over time, the distribution of waiting times to first conception differs by at most a little over 1
percentage point at any month from
the case in which fecundability is heterogeneous among women. Indeed, after the first year, the differences in the
proportions conceiving in any single
month is less than one-half of 1 per
cent. We have seen that in the absence
of sterility, the cumulative proportion
who have not conceived by Month 25 is
just 0.01 in the heterogeneous case.?4
In all, if we exclude sterility, heterogeneity in fecundability from any (other)
source at those early ages has little effect on the distribution of waiting times
to conception.

The results from our analyses of fetal loss do suggest, however, that it is a
possible source of variation which may
help to explain “low” estimates of fecundability (in the range of 0.07 to
0.10) which have been based on
higher-order birth intervals (Goldman
et al., 1987; Guz and Hobcraft, 1991;
Trussell et al., 1985). This explanation
may operate through two mechanisms:

24The sample survivor function for the Hutterite
data used by Heckman and Walker shows that 4 per
cent of the women had not conceived by Month 25,

first, through its direct effect at older
ages; and, second, because birth intervals at later ages may represent an
increasingly selected group. For example, in settings in which effective contraception is widely practiced, the actual women reproducing at older ages
might include a large fraction of
women who have not yet attained their
desired family size because of recurrent pregnancy loss. Thus, the effective
heterogeneity in fecundability, i.e., the
variation among women who are still
exposed to the risk of a fertile conception, may be even less than we have
assumed.25 But even at older ages, in
the absence of sterility, our results
clearly show that high proportions of
women would conceive within one
year, and except at the very oldest
ages, virtually all would conceive
within five years.

There is a built-in difficulty about
testing our models empirically. If heterogeneity in fetal loss contributes importantly to variation in fecundability,
we would be unlikely to be able to see
it unless we examined higher-than-first
order birth intervals or intervals initiated at late ages in very large samples.
Our illustrative analyses further suggest that at early ages, in the absence of
sterility, the overall effects of heterogeneity in fecundability are small.
Again, large samples—at least an order of magnitude larger than we customarily have—would be required to
discriminate among theoretical mod
25While this selectivity might reduce the heterogeneity in fetal loss, it would simultaneously increase the risk of fetal loss among women who were
still reproducing, so that the overall effect of fetal
loss at these ages may still be substantial. Our estimates of fetal loss by age are based on “natural fertility” populations in which such selectivity is presumably minimal.

els. For descriptive purposes, any number of functional forms adequately capture the distribution of waiting times.
What is the broader context of these
results? Heckman and Walker (1991)
have shown that ‘‘a fundamental nonidentification problem lies at the heart
of the conventional indirect method for
estimating the population distribution
of fecundability” (p. 283). Using standard goodness-of-fit tests, many functional forms adequately describe data
on waiting times to first conception.
The finding that a variety of functions can be shown to be consistent
with empirical distributions should not
discourage efforts directed toward
modeling the behavioral and physiological processes underlying fecundability. How one interprets the Heckman-Walker (1991) results ultimately
depends upon the paradigm directing
and guiding the organization of one’s
research. We believe that empirically
and theoretically driven modeling efforts can provide complementary contributions. Our own approach has been
guided by theory. We have attempted
to inform our modeling efforts by using
current information on the biological
and behavioral components of human
reproduction. Our models are realizations or “translations” of our theories
regarding how these components are
related. Consistency with the data
from empirical distributions cannot
prove that the theoretical model is correct (although lack of consistency
would force us to reconsider the theory). The present work suggests that
for purposes of testing theoretically
motivated models—models that attempt to discriminate among the underlying structural processes that determine fecundability—our efforts

should be directed toward examining
reproductive experience after age 35,
and toward incorporating information
on characteristics of the fertile period
as it becomes available.
