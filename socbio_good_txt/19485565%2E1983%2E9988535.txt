ABSTRACT: In this admixed population with no significant confounding of race and environment, there is an increase of blood pressure with Negro ancestry. There appears to be a direct
effect of race on blood pressure in addition to an indirect effect through height.

A significant association between
race and blood pressure has been shown
by several studies in different populations. According to this relationship,
higher levels of arteria) pressure are
found among individuals of Negro ancestry (Lennard and Glock, 1955; Johnson and Remington, 1961; Langford et
al., 1968; MacLean et al., 1974; Barbosa, 1976). However, as the confounding of racial admixture with some environmental factors affecting blood
pressure cannot be excluded, the causality of a primary effect of race is questionable.

In this paper we test whether racial
effect is casual or merely due to confounding with other factors in a Brazilian admixed population where the environment differences among racial
groups are nonsignificant.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Measurements of height and of systolic and diastolic blood pressures were
taken in a standard manner by one person (Nance et al., 1965). These variables
were adjusted for age and sex effects by
regression on a polynomial function
f(a,s) which includes sex, age, age’,

age®, sex X age, sex X age? and sex X
age®. The stability of variance of the adjusted variables with increasing values
of f(a,s) was examined, taking

Y= 5 as) —
9j

where j denotes one of the several sub
equal classes of f(a,s) within which the

variable x - f(a,s) has mean ps; and vari
ance Gj.

Race as a proportion of Negroid admixture was taken independently for
each individual from a phenotypic scale
calibrated against several genetic systems (Krieger et al., 1965). The variable
“race” was created by regressing the
first principal component of height and
systolic and diastolic blood pressures on
Negroid admixture, the latter estimated
from phenotypes and polymorphisms.
Similarly, an environmental index
(called “estimated environment” in Figure 1) was created by regressing the
principal component on a linear function f(z) of parental literacy, type of
habitation, and geographical coordinates of the place of family origin. This
generates ten correlation coefficients
between race, environmental index,

height, and systolic and diastolic blood
pressures for casual analysis according
to the methods of Rao et al. (1977 and
1980).

For maximum likelihood estimation
of path coefficients and likelihood ratio
tests of hypotheses, let r,, be an observed correlation coefficient between
the variables x and y (indices and effects) based on N pairs of observations,
and let p,, be the corresponding popula
tion value. The observed Z-transform

 

has mean

 

and variance - covariance matrix & incorporates correlations between correlations (Elston, 1975). Since Z transforms follow a multivariate normal
distribution (Rao, 1979), the loglikelihood is

InL = —(x? + In{S|)/2 + constant

where X?, a quadratic form in terms of
Zy and Z yy, asymptotically follows a X*
distribution with m-k degrees of freedom (m is the number of observed correlations and k is the number of parameters estimated) and |=| is the
determinant of the matrix =.

Estimates of path coefficients are obtained by maximizing InL; likelihood ratio tests of hypotheses are carried out in
terms of the residual X?, since In|Z| does
not vary much across hypotheses. When
k+w parameters are estimated under
the general model, goodness-of-fit of
the model is tested by the residual X2
value with m-k-w degrees of freedom
and denoted here as

2
Xk+w?

Barbosa et al.

 

Social Biology

Let the residual X2 value be
2

Xk

when w of the k+w parameters are fixed
under a null hypothesis. The likelihood
ratio test of such a null hypothesis is provided by

xox xbew

which follows asymptotically a X? distribution with w degrees of freedom.
Any casual system, in addition to a
nonsignificant X* test of goodness-of-fit,
has to satisfy the conditions imposed by
the equations of complete determination, that is

0<D p+ 2ED pypapy<!

where the p’s are path coefficients, j is an
effect or an index, and i and k are
causes. Once a casual model is fitted,
certain predictions may be expressed in
terms of the relative direct effect of
cause i on effect /, defined by

DE (i, j) = Py/ Py

where p,; is the direct path from cause i
to effect j, and p,; is the total expected
correlation between i andj.

RESULTS

The simple correlation with Negroid
admixture was 0.08 for height and for
systolic pressure and 0.04 for diastolic
pressure. These correlations are small
but statistically significant, with
n=5,570 observations.

Expressed as standard partial regression coefficients, the associations are
consistent (Table 1). A displacement of
one standard deviation in race as mesured changes height and systolic pres

The ten observed correlations are
presented in Table 2, of which those of

members are correlated for both genetic
and environmental reasons, correlations were estimated between family
means weighted by the number of observations (father, mother, and children).

We fitted several models to the ten
correlations of Table 2, and Figure 1
presents one of the representative ones.
Here we postulate two common causes
for systolic and diastolic blood pressures
(measured variables): a “‘true environment” (unobserved) of which the estimated environment is an index, and
‘blood pressure” (unobserved) derived
partly from race and height. The complete model involves ten unknown parameters, and therefore we cannot test

However, the direct effect of both race

and height
(xi = 6.00, P < 0.02)

on blood pressure are significant. The
parsimonious hypothesis that excludes

correlation between race and environment and the effect of environment on
systolic blood pressure fits very well

(xz = 3.38, P > 0.18).

Estimates of the relative direct effect of
race on blood pressure under acceptable
hypotheses are impressively high, in
agreement with the outcome of hypothesis testing. In Figure 1, the two nonsignificant paths are shown by broken
lines (with estimates under the general
hypothesis), and the other path coefficients were obtained under the parsimonious hypothesis.

DISCUSSION

We have found evidence supporting
that blood pressure increases with Negroid ancestry, after allowance for measured environmental factors. This is sug

gestive of a genetic basis especially since
the environmental components which
predispose to elevate blood pressure do
not appear to be confounded with race
in the studied population. However, the
possibility that some unmeasured environmental cause is associated with race
cannot be entirely excluded on this evidence.

Our analyses provide evidence that
both race and height directly effect
blood pressure. This is in a good agreement with previous findings of an increase of blood pressure with height independent of obesity (Feinleib and
Garrison, 1979; Ward et al. 1979) and
with the suggestion that height is enhanced by African ancestry (Krieger,
1970).

Other studies indicate a consistent racial difference for adults in North America and the Caribbean, regardless of salt
intake (Johnson and Remington, 1961).
The racial difference is less (and for
some samples nonsignificant) in childhood, but urinary kallikrein concentration is reduced in black children (Zinner
et al. 1976). This may be a percursor of
subsequent blood pressure elevation.

Attempts to define psychologic and
sociocultural factors of hypertension
have been plagued with measurement

Social Biology

problems (Scotch and Geiger, 1963).
Race relations were easier in Northeastern Brazil than in the United States, and
racial admixture has progressed further
(Smith, 1951). A stress hytpothesis appears neither plausible nor testable in
this population, but would be difficult to
exclude.

Despite the suggestive evidence of a
genetic basis, the hypothesis of a common gene with large effect on blood
pressure is excluded by segregation
analysis. Contrary to Platt (1963) there
is no detectable megaphenic polymorphism for blood pressure (Morton et al.,
1980; Krieger et al. 1980).

Lacking clear evidence of a specific
mechanism underlying the racial difference, more sophisticated studies of family resemblance in this hybrid population, including estimates of racial
mixture and biological as well as adoptive relationships could in principle discriminate between genetic and cultural
inheritance (Rao et al., 1974).
