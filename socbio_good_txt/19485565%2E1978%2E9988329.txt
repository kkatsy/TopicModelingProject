Decomposition of the Change in the Total
Fertility Rate in the Republic of Korea,

1966-1970

ABSTRACT: Own-children fertility estimates derived from the Korean censuses of 1966 and 1970
indicate that the total fertility rate fell by more than half a child in the intercensal period, from an
estimated 4,837 to 4,257 per thousand. A compositional analysis shows that about one-fourth of
the fall can be attributed to changes in population composition by urban-rural residence, education, marital status, and parity, and about three-fourths to changes in age-specific birth rates
cross-classified by these same characteristics. The own-children method is used to generate the
finely specified birth rates necessary for this analysis, and a decomposition technique used
previously by one of the authors is extended to incorporate the unusually large number of

compositional variables.

The Korean total fertility rate fell sharply during the 1960’s, from an estimated
5,955 in 1960(Cho, 1974) to 4,257 in 1970.
Conforming to a pattern common in developing nations where a fertility transition has clearly begun (Kirk, 1971), this
rapid and sustained fertility decline was
both preceded and accompanied by rapid
mortality decline and economic development. Sustained mortality decline began
in the mid-1950’s, with life expectancy rising from 52 years in 1955-60 to 64 years in
1971 (Cho, 1973). Per capita income, at
current prices and exchange rates, increased at an average rate of 5.0 per cent
between 1960 and 1970, rising from U.S.
$146 (a comparatively low level for fertility decline to commence) to $241 (United
Nations, 1972a, p. 596). The average annual growth rate of industrial output accelerated from 6.3 per cent in the first half
of the decade to 11.0 per cent in the second
half (United Nations 1972b; Adelman,
1969).

The composition of the population by

socioeconomic characteristics also evolved
rapidly over the 1960's, and it is on the
fertility impact of this evolution that the
present paper focuses. The aim is to decompose the change in the total fertility
rate between 1966 and 1970 into two sets
of contributions, one from changes in
population composition by urban-rural residence, education, marital status, and
parity, and the second from changes in
age-specific fertility cross-classified by
these same characteristics. The finely specified birth rates necessary for this analysis
are computed by a recent extension of the
own-children method (Retherford and
Cho, in press) as applied to the Korean
censuses of 1966 and 1970.

The decomposition method used here is
an extension of a technique used in an
earlier study which sought to measure the
contributions of three factors—changing
age composition, marital status composition, and age-specific marital fertility—to
decline in the Korean crude birth rate between 1960 and 1970 (Retherford and

116 Retherford
Cho, 1973). The present analysis differs
from the earlier one in that the time period
is shorter, the number of compositional
variables is larger, and the total fertility
rate (TFR) is used instead of the crude
birth rate (CBR). The present analysis
employs a straightforward extension of the
decomposition method used in the earlier
study.

The time frame of analysis is restricted
to the period 1966-70 for reasons of data
availability. Despite its short duration,
however, this period witnessed remarkably rapid shifts in population composition
and a substantial fall in the TFR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Basic data sources are the Korean censuses of 1 October 1966 and 1 October
1970, conducted by the Bureau of Statistics. Analysis is based on a 1 per cent
sample from the 1966 census and a 10 per
cent sample from the 1970 census. The
own-children method of fertility estimation (Cho, 1971la and 19716; Retherford
and Cho, in press) is applied to these data
sets to estimate age-specific birth rates and
TFR’s, specific for urban-rural residence,
education, marital status, and parity for
1966 (1 October 1965 to 1 October 1966)
and 1970 (1 October 1969 to 1 October
1970) (see Table 1.)

The own-children method of fertility estimation is a reverse-survival method. In
essence, children by own age and mother’s
age enumerated in the census are reversesurvived to estimate births by mother’s
age in prior years, and women by age are
reverse-survived to estimate the agespecific population at risk. Age-specific
birth rates and birth probabilities are obtained as suitably adjusted quotients of
these two basic quantities. In the case of
Korea, lunar ages were translated into
standard completed years of age by the

and Ogawa Social Biology
Bureau of Statistics before the estimation
procedure was applied.

Reverse-survival computations require
life tables. To obtain fertility estimates for
1966, based on enumerated children less
than a year old and women in the 1966
census, we used 1966 life tables by sex
computed by the Korean Bureau of Statistics (Korea, Economic Planning Board,
1966). Separate life tables were available
and used for urban, rural, and all Korea.
Rural mortality was slightly higher than
urban mortality in 1966. For 1970, published life tables by urban-rural residence
were not available, so we used CoaleDemeny (1966) model life tables. Based on
residence-specific child mortality estimates
computed by the Brass method (Brass,
1968) applied to the two censuses, we
chose, in consultation with the Bureau of
Statistics, West level 20.4 for urban areas,
West level 19.5 for rural areas, and West
level 19.9 for all Korea.

Application of the own-children method
requires adjustment factors for census underenumeration of children less than a
year old and women of childbearing age.
For 1970 we utilized the following adjustment factors, obtained from the 1970
census and postenumeration survey, to inflate own children and women by age (age
groups specified in parentheses): 1.107 (0),
1.096 (15-19), 1.099 (20-24), 1.062 (2529), 1.040 (30-34), 1.029 (35-39), 1.032
(40-44), and 1.026 (45-49). At the suggestion of the Bureau of Statistics, we used
the 1970 factors also for 1966, as the 1966
postenumeration survey is thought to contain inaccuracies. Underenumeration adjustments involved no distinctions by
rural-urban residence, education, marital
status, or parity, as the necessary data
were not available.

Our TFR estimates of 4,837 for 1966
and 4,257 for 1970 differ somewhat from
previous estimates. Cho’s (1974) estimates,

based on 10 per cent census samples for
1966 and 1970, were 4,757 for 1966 and
4,124 for 1970. The discrepancies are
small and are explained principally by our
use of computer matching instead of hand
matching of own children to mothers
within households (Ho, 1976), and our use
of a 1 per cent instead of a 10 per cent
sample for 1966.

TFR estimates from the 1968 and 1971
fertility surveys conducted by the Korean
Institute for Family Planning (KIFP) are
4,746 for 1966 and 4,443 for 1970 (Korean
Institute for Family Planning, 1973). The
agreement between the KIFP estimate for
1966 and Cho’s and our estimates for 1966
is fairly close and appears to justify our
decision to use 1970 inflation factors to
adjust the 1966 census. But for reasons not
entirely clear, the estimates do not agree so
well for 1970. A possible source of discrepancy is the considerably smaller size of
the KIFP samples compared with the census samples. If sampling variability accounts for the 1970 discrepancy, the census estimates would seem more reliable.
On the other hand, the KIFP fertility survey data may be of higher quality owing to
better training of and more control over
enumerators. In the absence of conclusive
evidence, we simply note the disagreement
among the 1970 TFR estimates and base
our analysis on the own-children estimates, since the KIFP samples are in any
case too small to yield the finely specified
birth rates required for the decomposition
analysis described in this paper.

Decompositions of the change in the
TFR between 1966 and 1970 are calculated using an elaboration of a method
developed by Kitagawa (1955). Kitagawa’s method decomposes a change in the
crude birth rate into a sum of age-specific
components, one set of which is due to
changes in age structure and a second set

_ due to changes in age-specific birth rates.

Retherford and Cho (1973) expanded the

Retherford and Ogawa

Social Biology

method to incorporate the impact of
changes in marital status composition. .
Here we utilize the TFR instead of the
CBR, and we further expand the method
to include any number of variables, the
principal limitation being sample size. (If
the CBR is used, the decompositions are
altered somewhat and include an additional set of components from changes in
age composition. These are very small,
however, because age composition
changed little over the four-year period
under consideration.)

Consider a change in 7FR = 5 2,F,,
where F, is the age-specific birth rate for
the 5-year age group beginning at age x.
Suppose we write F, as a weighted sum of
age-residence-specific birth rates, where
each weight £,, is the proportion of the age
group x tox + 5 with residence (urban o
rural). Then

TFR = 5 2yy Ror For (1)
and

ATFR = 5 Zany For Aker
+ 5 Zar Rep AF zy, (2)

where the symbol A denotes change and
where F,,, and k,, are average values over

‘the period, obtained by summing the be
ginning and end values and dividing by
two. We thus obtain a sum of two principal contributions to A7TFR, the first of
which can be interpreted as stemming
from changes in residence composition by
age and the second from changes in ageresidence-specific birth rates. Each. of
these two principal contributions can in
turn be broken down by age if so desired.

The above decomposition method can
be. extended to more variables by decomposing AF,, in the same way as ATFR.
Suppose we introduce variables in the
order (after age) of residence (r), education
(e), marital status (m), and parity (p). Residence consists of two sectors (urban and
rural); education, of three (none, primary,

and more); marital status, of two (married
and not married); and parity, of ten (O9+). We assume that all births occur
within marriage, an acceptable assumption in view of Korea’s low rate of illegitimacy. The final decomposition is then

cation groups. The fourth term denotes
the contribution from changes in parity
composition within residence-educationmarital status groups. The fifth term denotes the contribution from changes in
age-residence-education-marital _— statusparity-specific birth rates.

The order in which variables are introduced into the decomposition in Equation
(3) clearly influences the results. The order
of residence, education, marital status,
parity, and marital fertility reflects for
most persons a logical time sequence of
life-cycle events, and we shall retain it
throughout most of the analysis. This or- |
dering, however, may not bring out fully
the explanatory power of certain variables. Later in the paper, therefore, we
shall examine alternative orderings, as
well as the effect of deleting certain variables from the analysis.

The distinction between compositional
and fertility contributions in Equation (3)
is not entirely unambiguous. Part of the
reason is mathematical. Compositional
contributions depend not only on Ak values but also on F values, which are affected by change in F. Fertility contributions likewise depend not only on AF values but also on & values, which are affected by changes ink values. Distinctions
among the several compositional contributions are not entirely unambiguous either.

An alternative decomposition procedure
not beset with this difficulty examines the
effect of varying one compositional or fertility variable at a time while holding all
others constant at their initia] values. This
alternative procedure begins with the formula

TFR = 5 Ler (Rrr (Xe Rere
(Lim Rrrem (2p Reremp F xrremp )))). (4)

To get the contribution to A7JFR from
changes in educational composition, for
example, one first computes a value 7FR*
based on values of kyr, Reremy and F yremp
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:37 08 December 2015

for 1966 and values of &,,-- for 1970. The
quantity (TFR* — TFR*®), taken as a

percentage of TFRO%® — TFR%®, is then

the contribution of change in educational
composition to the overall change in the
TFR. Contributions from changes in residence composition, marital status composition, parity composition, and fertility are
similarly obtained.

Unfortunately, this alternative decomposition is not strictly additive. It contains
a residual term obtained by subtracting
the sum of the earlier terms from 100 per
cent. The presence of this residual term
means that numerical contributions in this
decomposition generally differ from those
in the decomposition based on Equation
(3). Nevertheless, the relative importance
of the several contributions is the same in
both decompositions as illustrated in
Table 2. Decompositions based on Equation (3) are preferred because they do not
contain residual terms.

Retherford and Ogawa

Social Biology

Movement of persons from one compositional category to another, say rural to
urban, itself influences category-specific
fertility, because, in general, movers do
not assume instantaneously the fertility
behavior of their new category of membership.

A final caution in interpreting the decompositions is that the fertility contribution to change in the TFR cannot be interpreted as a family planning program contribution. This fact becomes clear when
one considers that addition of more compositional variables into the analysis (say,
occupation and income) might substantially alter the size of the fertility contribution. Moreover, over time, the fertility
implications of membership in a given
compositional category may change owing
to changes in social context. For example,
the bearing of a primary school education
on occupational mobility, which in turn
bears on fertility, changes considerably as

There is a second, more sociological reason why the distinction between compositional and fertility contributions is not entirely unambiguous, and it pertains to decompositions obtained by either method.

economic success become higher. The

partly on changing reproductive motivations born of an evolving social context,
not just on changing availability and cost
of birth control.

RESULTS

The Korean TFR declined from an estimated 4,837 to 4,257 per thousand between 1966 and 1970 (see Table 1). Table
3 decomposes this change into components, following the procedure specified by
Equation (3) in the previous section.

The first-order decomposition in Table
3 includes only urban-rural residence as a
compositional variable. Changes in residence composition contributed 25.2 per
cent of the decrease in the TFR, and
changes in age-specific fertility within residence categories contributed 74.8 per
cent. The 16.9 per cent decline in the rural
TFR (from 5,793 to 4,814, as shown in
Table 1) dominated the 74.8 per cent fertility contribution. The urban TFR actually
increased by 8.6 per cent (from 3,298 to
3,581).

may have judged the period an especially
propitious time to add to their families.
Such a hypothesis is in line with the experience of Western countries, where
short-term economic fluctuations have
often induced short-term fertility fluctuations in the same direction, superimposed
on the secular fertility decline. The comparatively high fertility of newly arrived
rural-urban migrants no doubt also contributed to increase urban fertility.

The second-order decomposition in
Table 3 indicates education as well as residence as compositional variables, with
education introduced after residence. The
introduction of education splits the 74.8
per cent fertility contribution in the firstorder decomposition into two parts, one
due to changes in educational composition
within residence categories (21.8 per cent),
and a second due to changes in age-specific
fertility within residence-education categories (52.9 per cent). In the second-order
decomposition, then, about half the decline in the TFR stems from compositional
changes in residence and education.

The increase in urban fertility is unexpected and demands at least a tentative
explanation. We may hypothesize that the

beneficiaries of the extraordinarily rapid
economic gains of the late 1960’s. Younger

time, however, the panels of k,, and Rere
values show a dramatic rise in age-specific
proportions urban and age-specific proportions having elementary or more education, groups characterized by relatively
low proportions married as shown by the
Rrrem Values. Remarkably, the proportion
of the female population aged 15-49 residing in urban areas jumped from 38.6 to
46.6 per cent in the scant four years between the two censuses, and the proportion with no education dropped from 28.9
to 19.4 per cent. The shift of population
into residence-education categories with
relatively low proportions married was
large enough to offset the rise in proportions married within residence-education
categories, so that country-wide proportions married generally fell at the peak
reproductive ages, though not at the late
reproductive ages, as shown by the last
column of &srem values in Table 4. These
points are elaborated later by examining
what happens when the residence and
education variables are dropped from the
decomposition.

The fourth-order decomposition in
Table 3 includes parity as well as residence, education, and marital status as
compositional variables. The introduction
of parity splits the 65.3 per cent fertility
contribution in the third-order decomposition into two parts, one due to changes in
parity composition within residence-education-marital status categories (—10.3 per
cent), and a second due to changes in agespecific fertility within residence-education-marital status-parity categories (75.6
per cent). Changes in parity composition,
like those in marital status composition,
tended to increase the TFR. This result
was difficult to predict. At a given age, the
relationship between fertility and parity is
generally U-shaped, with relatively high
fertility at very low and very high parities.
A compositional shift toward lower

parities could either raise or lower overall
fertility, depending on the magnitude of
the shift. It is noteworthy, finally, that
compositional contributions of education,
marital status, and parity in Table 3 approximately cancel each other. The fertil

ity contributions in the first-order and
fourth-order decompositions are almost
identical. |

Let us now examine in more detail the
impact on the TFR of changes in marital
status composition. To simplify computations, we omit consideration of changes in
parity composition, contributions from
which are merged into a redefined and less
finely specified fertility contribution. This
merger has no effect on the magnitudes of
the residence, education, and marital

_status contributions which form the focus

of our attention.

In Table 5 each decomposition contains
marital status as a compositional variable,
in alternative combination with the residence and education variables. Note,
however, that the order of introduction of
variables is still the same as in Table 3.
Decomposition (a) shows that with residence and education composition uncontrolled, the marital status contribution of
5.6 per cent tended to decrease the TFR,

in line with earlier studies. But when education is introduced in decomposition (b),
the marital status contribution reverses
sign, changing from 5.6 to —10.3 per cent.
If residence is substituted for education as
a control, in decomposition (c), the marital
status contribution changes. from 5.6 to
—2.9 per cent. Again there is a reversal of
sign, but the magnitude of the shift is
smaller. These findings suggest that education has a somewhat larger impact on
proportions married than does residence,
in agreement with earlier studies (Kim et
al., 1974). Decomposition (d) is taken from
Table 3 for comparison. |
Table 6 sheds further light on the relative importance of the residence and education variables. As mentioned earlier,
Table 3 shows that with education introduced after residence, contributions to the
decline in the TFR were 25.2 per cent for
residence and 21.8 per cent for education.
Table 6 shows that when the variables are
reversed and residence is introduced after

education, the contributions are 42.6 per
cent for education and only 4.6 per cent
for residence. The value of 42.6 per cent
also appears in Table 5.

According to Table 6, changes in education composition would appear largely to
explain away the effects of changes in residence composition on the country-wide
TFR shown in Table 3. But the reasons
why this is so are not immediately obvious. The lesser importance of changes in
residence composition is principally due
to the unusual circumstance discussed earlier, that the decline in rural fertility was
partly offset by a rise in urban fertility. It
is not true that within the same education
category the TFR behaved similarly in
urban and rural areas. In fact, such comparisons reveal striking differences. Table
7 shows the per cent contribution of
changes in marital structure and marital
fertility to change in the TFR within each
residence-education group, derived by
Equation (1) with marital status substituted for residence. Within the two education categories of primary school and more
than primary school, urban and rural
TFR’s actually moved in opposite directions. And within all three education categories the relative importance of marital
status and fertility contributions differed
markedly between urban and rural areas.

 

in Korea 125

Changes in age-specific proportions
married tended to increase the TFR for
each education group within the urban
category and also for the more educated
group within the rural category. In these
four groups, age-specific proportions married rose, with very few exceptions, as
shown by the & ,,.», values in Table 4. For
those with no education or only a primary
education in the rural category, however,
changes in age-specific proportions married worked to reduce the TFR, though
not by very much. Proportions married
generally fell at the peak reproductive ages
and rose at the late reproductive ages.

For those with primary or more education in the urban category, Table 7 shows
that not only changes in marital structure
but also changes in marital fertility
worked to increase the TFR, reflecting in- |
creases in age-specific marital fertility at
the peak reproductive ages shown in
Table 1 and supporting our earlier hypothesis that younger couples in the urban
educated classes were in an especially
favorable position to add to their families
during this period. For those with no education in the urban category and those
with more than primary education in the
rural category, however, changes in marital fertility tended to decrease the TFR,
thereby offsetting increases in proportions

married. The large offsetting contributions of —157.9 per cent and 257.9 per
cent from marital structure changes and
marital fertility changes in the urban-none
category occur because nearly offsetting
unpercentaged contributions from changes
in proportions married and changes in
marital fertility are percentaged on a very
small net decline in the TFR.

Table 7 suggests that the rise in urban
fertility may have stemmed less from the
higher fertility of newly arrived ruralurban migrants than from the especially
favorable economic situation of young
couples in the urban educated classes during this period. If the higher fertility of
migrants were the dominant factor, one
would not expect the increase in urban
fertility to be more pronounced the higher
the level of education, given that migrants
were generally less educated than the
urban average. More information about
the fertility of migrants is needed, however, before a definitive statement can be
made on this point.

CONCLUSION

Between 1966 and 1970 the Korean
total fertility rate fell by more than half a
child, from an estimated 4,837 to 4,257
per thousand. Rapid change also occurred
in population composition by urban-rural
residence, education, marital status, and
parity. Compositional changes by resi

dence and education were especially significant, the proportion of the female population aged 15-49 residing in urban areas
jumping from 38.6 to 46.6 per cent and the
proportion with no education dropping
from 28.9 to 19.4 per cent.

Decomposition of the decline in the
TFR over this period shows that about
one-fourth of it can be attributed to
changes in population composition by residence, education, marital status, and
parity, and about three-fourths to changes
in age-specific birth rates cross-classified
by these same characteristics. Changes in
composition by residence and education
largely explain the contribution of changes
in marital composition to the decline in the
TFR. With residence and education controlled, changes in marital composition
actually tended to increase the TFR.
Changes in education composition in turn
largely explain the contribution of changes
in residence composition to the decline in
the TFR. Education emerges as the compositional variable with the greatest explanatory power.
