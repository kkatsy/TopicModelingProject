Assortative Mating in Monozygotic Twins

ABSTRACT: This study investigated assortative mating in a series of monozygotic twins in terms
of anthropometric variables. Initially the twins were analyzed independent of each other, and
the results showed fairly clear homogamy among female MZ twins and their spouses, after
correcting for age. Further, when stature was partialled out, several anthropometric measures
remained significantly correlated. The results for male MZ twins and their spouses were not
nearly so clear-cut. A second analysis treated the co-twins together, and once again, the female
MZ sets tended to show assortative mate choice for stature while the male MZ twins/spouses
were not significantly correlated. A follow-up analysis investigated whether husbands of the
female twins were correlated to each other, and negative results were found for all of the 46
anthropometric variables. An apparent contradiction was resolved in the case of stature by
regressing spouse stature against that of the co-twins. It was found that although each of the
twins was assortatively mating, one member of the twin set consistently married a taller
husband, but the difference was not constant. This had the effect of producing divergent

regression lines.

Interest in mating preferences and
the intrigue of bisexual reproduction
have not waned in the years since
Darwin published his monumental work
on sexual selection (Darwin, 1871). Accordingly, human mate choice continually garners a full share of research attention. Results generally show that
phenotypic similarity is mutually attractive, that is, people customarily practice
homogamy or positive assortative mating for many, but not all, traits. Indeed,
assortative mating is probably the most
common departure from random mating found in Western societies (Buss,
1985). Theories of mating preferences
have attempted to keep pace with the
wealth of findings derived from research
efforts of psychologists, sociologists, geneticists, and human biologists (Epstein
and Guttman, 1984; Ho, 1986; Thelen,
1988).

Perhaps one of the more intriguing
theories in recent years 1s that of Thies
sen and Gregg (1980). They follow
something of a sociobiological approach
in proposing that choosing one’s mate
based upon similarity for certain traits

‘might enhance the reproductive strategy

of maximizing genetic representation in
the next generation. This theory, which
is Obviously evolutionarily based, attempts to link assortative mating with
natural selection, and if correct, would
have profound implications. Of course,
assortative mating by itself does not alter gene frequencies, although it can
over time have the major effect of increasing the total genetic variance
within a population (Crow and Felsenstein, 1968).

In another vein, Price and Vandenberg (1980) have discussed four ways of
accounting for the observed similarities
between couples, namely: (a) similarity
due to an initial assortment at the time
of marriage/mating, (b) convergence in
phenotype over the years of cohabita

tion, (c) attrition from the sample
through divorce of those who were least
similar, and (d) a confounding with agerelated variables, that is, a tendency for
aging humans in general to share certain
changes in common, such as weight gain
or stature reduction. Clearly, these factors must be reckoned with before any
theory of assortative mating can be
properly tested.

In this paper we have sought to determine the degree to which identical twins
and their prospective spouses practiced
assortative marriage. Also, we were interested in the question of whether the
spouses of each twin pair closely resembled one another. The spouses might be
expected to be quite similar if, (a) the
twins' were controlling the mate selection process, and (b) the twins made
similar choices of mates, in line with
their other shared behaviors and common lifestyles. The latter of these two
considerations would more likely apply
to the female MZ twins than to the male
twins, based on informal discussions we
had with the twins concerning their patterns of preferences and decision making.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This study was part of a long-term examination of adult monozygotic twins,
their husbands or wives, and their children undertaken by the Medical Genetics Department, Indiana University
Medical School, Indianapolis. Zygosity
of the twins was determined by the similarity method and utilized more than 20
heritable blood and salivary markers
(Nance et al., 1974). Each of the sets of
twins were reared together.

Our data consist of 46 anthropometric variables measured on 16 male and
32 female twin pairs and their spouses.

Assortative Mating

129

The measurements were taken between
1974 and 1976 by a single anthropometrist; namely, Dona Thompson-Jacob.
She was trained by one of us (PLJ), and
her techniques followed those of Hertzberg et al. (1963) and Weiner and
Lourie (1969). The primary method of
analysis was linear correlation, and all
data were processed on a CDC 855 computer using the SPSS packaged programs.

The families generally resided in the
Indianapolis area, although some lived
in surrounding communities and a few
came from bordering states, most often
Illinois. Regarding racial background,
all of the twin families indicated only
Caucasian ancestry with these exceptions. Two of the female twin pairs reported having American Indian grandparents while one male twin pair had a
Mexican ancestor in an unknown past
generation. In these cases of mixed ancestry as well as in the great majority of
the remaining twin families, northern
European countries (particularly Germany, England, and Ireland) were reported to be the prevalent sources of ancestors.

RESULTS |

Table 1 presents data on assortative
mating for the Indianapolis twin panel
for three variables: age, stature, and
weight. Comparative studies on assortative mating are also included. For this
part of the analysis, co-twins were
treated independent of one another, but
because of missing data the sample sizes
are reduced to 25 males and 52 females
rather than twice the number of twin
pairs reported above. Table 1 indicates
that the Indianapolis twin/spouse sets
are clearly mating assortatively for age.
Indeed, for the female twins and their

spouses over 70 per cent of the variance
was accounted for by the respective age
distributions, while in male twins and
their spouses the variance explained was
almost 94 per cent. These results are
quite similar to the comparative studies.
Based on the strong age correlation, we
decided to control, through partial correlation, for any effect years of cohabitation might have had on bringing about
phenotypic convergence. However, this
correction did not affect the results.

In Table 1 it can be seen that female
twins and spouses were assortatively
mating for stature irrespective of age.
Since age correlates very highly with
years of marriage (Price and Vandenberg, 1980) we can say that stature correspondence between twins and their
spouses was probably present at the
time of marriage and that this similarity
did not increase with years of marriage.

This finding is consistent with several
studies (Price and Vandenberg, 1980;
Pennoch-Roman, 1984; Harrison, et al.,
1976) all of which failed to find evidence
for phenotypic convergence in physical
characteristics. A contrary finding, acohabitation effect on spousal stature, was
reported by Garn et al. (1979).

It is important to point out that the
degree of age-controlled stature correlation between female twins and spouses
is greater than any of the published studies with the exception of an American
sample reported in Spuhler (1968)
which had an r-value of 0.63. Hence,
there is firm support for the notion that
at least female twins and their spouses
were assortatively mating at a higher
level than nontwins. On the other hand,
male twins and their spouses not only
did not reach a significant level of correlation for their stature but placed near to

the bottom in the list of comparative series.

With respect to body weight, we
found that female twins and spouses
closely approximated a 5 per cent level
of significance following adjustment for
age, but this relationship dropped to a
nonsignificant level once stature was
partialled out. The Indianapolis femaletwin/spouse data for weight does fall in
line with most of the comparative studies. Consistent with previous results,
male twins and spouses did not show any
indication of assortative mating for
weight.

Additional evidence of assortative
mating is shown in Table 2. Once again,
age and stature were partialled out from
these variables. First of all, in looking at
the male-twin/spouse results (on the
right-hand side of the table), we found
significant correlations for only two vari
ables, namely, ankle breadth and bizygomatic breadth. Given that nearly 50
measurements were investigated, these
results could simply reflect chance occurrence although they are also found
within the long list of significant variables present in female-twin/spouses.
The results of the female-twin/spouse
analysis clearly point toward a more
broadly based anthropometric homogamy. At the bottom of the table are
those variables that showed assortative
mating before removing their partial
correlation with stature. None of these
were significantly correlated with age.
This finding may not be too surprising in
that other than weight, most of these
variables are not very plastic, and thus
they are not subject to convergence as a
result of sharing a common environment. However, all of the variables at
the bottom of this table were signi

ficantly correlated with stature and
hence could be coincidental with respect
to assortative mating. That is, they
might not be directly involved in mate
selection but are significant only because of their strong association with
stature.

Conversely, since more than strictly
linear measurements are involved, it is
possible that assortative mating was
based on a general physical phenotype.
Indeed, that is what the stature controlled variables in the main portion of
Table 2 seem to suggest. Most of these
are breadth dimensions of the extremities and facial area, and therefore they
are not expected to co-vary with stature.
Of interest, all of these measures except
ear breadth remain significantly correlated after also correcting for body
weight. It would appear that these female twins and their spouses are assortatively mating for selected physical characteristics or appearances in addition to
general body size.

Up to now we have analyzed the
twins independently. Our next question
considered whether both members of
the twin pair were participating in assortative mating along a similar direction and to a similar degree. To examine
this we first needed a way to assign the
twin members to separate groups. We
opted to use birth order on the basis of
an earlier study (Jamison et al., 1989)
that showed the first-born of the twinpair generally to be a larger adult than
the second-born co-twin. By grouping
on the basis of birth order, we would
help to preserve any body size differences that might enter into the assortative mating process. Results of this analysis can be seen in Table 3.

Again referring to the lower half of
this table, we see that male-twin/spouse
correlations for stature were not signi

ficant. However, the female-twin/
spouse correlations were significant in
the first-born-twin/spouse group and
closely approached statistical significance in the second-born group. Thus,
we can say that assortative mating for
stature seems to follow similar lines for
both members of the female twin pairs.

The next obvious question to ask is
whether mates of co-twins closely resemble one another. We looked at this
matter only in the female twins and their
spouses; hence, we were asking whether
the husbands of co-twins were phenotypically similar. Our results showed no
significant correlations between the husbands for any of the 46 anthropometric
variables. This result was rather puzzling, particularly in light of our finding
that co-twins were each assortatively
mating for stature; yet the stature correlation between their husbands was only
r= —0.013 P = 0.96, N = 22).

An explanation for this apparent contradiction might be found when looking
more closely at the relationship between
the husband’s heights. Figure 1 shows
the regression of spouse stature on twin
stature analyzed by first- and secondborn twin groups. As can be seen, there
is indeed an assortative distribution
whereby stature increase in the twins
corresponds to stature increase in their

husbands, as reported in Table 3. Yet,
importantly, the first-born twin tended
to marry a husband somewhat taller
than the husband of her co-twin, but the
amount of difference was not constant,
i.e., the difference increased with in
creasing twin stature, resulting in divergent lines. If the difference had been
systematic, the regression lines would
be parallel, but perhaps separated
slightly due to the slightly taller firstborn twin. This divergence of the regres

sion lines, extending from shorter to
taller couples, seems to explain the lack
of correlation in stature between the
husbands of the twins. Particularly at
the upper end of the stature range, the
first-born twin tended to marry a taller
husband as compared with her co-twin’s
husband.

DISCUSSION

The findings of this study strongly
suggest that certain anthropometric similarities between female MZ twins and
their husbands were present at the time
of marriage, rather than being the result
of phenotypic convergence, sample attrition, or age-related changes that
might have taken place over the years of
living together. It was our clear impression from observing the twins and making inquiries of them during the study
that in the case of female twins in particular, there was a strong tendency to
share behaviors, such as dress and hairstyles. They regularly described how
similar their day-to-day preferences and
decisions were. Quite often the female
identical twins not only resided within
the same city but even within the same
neighborhood. These remarkably similar behaviors have continued in some
cases for more than thirty years of adult
life.

Hence, our initial expectation was
that mate selection would follow along
the same pattern at least for the female
twins. We were not considering choice
of a marriage partner to be one-sided,
but we did feel that the close relationship that had developed between the female twins would exert some strong influence on the mutual acceptability of
prospective mates. Whatever the
strength of this influence, it did not
result in their choosing husbands who

were highly correlated as judged by anthropometrics. Yet we can say that assortative mating was practiced not only
for stature, but also for a fairly large set
of other measurements, mostly extremity and facial breadths, that were found
to be independent of the correspondence for stature.

Assortative mating based upon stature seems to be understood in Western
cultures in terms of the so-called “male
taller norm” (Gillis and Avis, 1980; McManus and Mascie-Taylor, 1984). This
means that across the stature range social expectations are that husbands will
exceed the heights of their wives. However, the validity of the “male taller
norm’”’ has been questioned on the
grounds that a decisive study has yet to
be performed (Epstein and Guttman,
1987). The study by McManus and
Mascie-Taylor (1984) has shown that
when reaching the higher end of the stature distribution there is a lessening of
the positive assortative pattern, and at
the extreme heights for wives there is
some evidence for negative assortative
mating. As pointed out by these authors, this finding might be the result of
the limited availability of appropriate
mates at the extreme heights.

When it comes to explaining the involvement of anthropometrics other
than stature in assortative mating, very
little is known or understood. There
could be an expression of cultural norms
for preferred physical characteristics or
attraction at a more personal level may
be operating (Buss, 1985). Physical resemblance to oneself has been proposed
to underlie this attraction (Chambers et
al., 1983). However, returning to the
theory mentioned at the outset, could it
also be that assortative mating is linked
with natural selection? Not many researchers have looked into this matter,

Vol. 37, No. 1-2

but in the case of the Ann Arbor study
(Spuhler, 1968) there was limited support for the idea that assortative mating
and fertility are linked. Indeed, Lewontin, et al. (1968) are of the opinion that
there is very little selection in the form
of differential fertility operating at the
present time on humans. Hence, assortative mating in the absence of a measurable fertility differential, if intense
enough and of long enough duration,
could lead to a redistribution of genes
toward homozygous genotypes, as well
as an increase in population variance,
but would not likely alter gene frequencies.

Finally, in this paper we have not ascribed directionality to the assortative
mating process. In other words, we assumed that mate selection is a mutual
decision among prospective partners.
On the other hand, identical twins could

well depart from this expectation, and as
our results suggest, female MZ twins
may in fact be controlling the decision.
No less an authority than Darwin concluded that, ‘“antipathies and preferences” in mate choice are more commonly found in the female than in the
male (Darwin, 1981, p. 273). Since the
male twins did not show any assortative
mating in anthropometrics, it can be
asked whether this finding should be
considered an expression of their independence in actions and therefore attributable to modes of behavior not explored in this study. Accordingly, future
research involving mate choice and anthropometry might do well to integrate a
behavioral component into the design in
order to assess directly the decisionmaking process which led to the measured phenotypic’ correspondence, or
lack thereof, between spouses.
