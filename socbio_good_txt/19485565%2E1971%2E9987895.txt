Congenital Hip Disease: Implications for

Genetic Counseling

Charles M. Woolf

Department of Zoology
Arizona State University
Tempe, Arizona

Although a genetic component has been
established for congenital hip disease, symbolized by CHD, it is clear that certain nongenetic factors are of etiologic importance
(Record and Edwards, 1958; Carter and
Wilkinson, 1964; Rabin et al., 1965; Woolf,
Koehn, and Coleman, 1968). Etiologic heterogeneity implies that some cases are more
genetically determined than others.

An investigation was designed to compare
the frequency of CHD in the close relatives
of different types of propositi with CHD in
order to test for etiologic heterogeneity
and to gain more insight into the genetics of
CHD. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of this study.

The data were obtained from a study carried out in Utah (Woolf et al., 1968) using
propositi obtained from medical records
made available by physicians in Salt Lake
City, Utah. Each propositus had undergone
therapeutic treatment for hip dysplasia or
dislocation (or both). Field workers visited
the homes of 290 propositi belonging to different sibships and obtained information of
epidemiologic interest. The frequency ° of
CHD was obtained in the following relatives
of the propositi: sibs, parents, grandparents,
aunts, uncles, and first cousins. The 290
propositi are classified in Table 1 as to sex,

10

 

type of disorder (unilateral or bilateral), and
whether the birth was breech or nonbreech.

FREQUENCY OF CHD IN RELATIVES
OF THE PROPOSITI

The frequencies of CHD in the various
relatives of the propositi are given in Table
2. It has been suggested (Carter and Wilkinson, 1964; Rabin et al., 1965; Woolf et al.,
1968) that a major genetic component consists of polygenes resulting in quasi-continuous variation. For this type of inheritance, the disorder occurs, or has an increased probability of occurring, if the
number of genes is above a threshold. The
coefficient of relationship (r) between propositi and parents, propositi and sibs, and
propositi and children, is in each case onehalf. When a polygenic mode of inheritance
is present, the frequency of the disorder
should be similar in parents, sibs, and children of the propositi. No data are available
in the literature on the frequency of CHD in
the children of propositi since all major
studies have used children as propositi.

The data of the present study for sibs and
parents would, by themselves, tend to negate a polygenic mode of inheritance. A
higher frequency of CHD occurred in the
sibs (4.12%, n = 897) than parents (1.55%,

the former is probably polygenic, while the
latter is probably due to a dominant gene.
When dominant inheritance is present, the
frequency of affected individuals decreases
by one-half as one proceeds from first-degree
to second-degree to third-degree relatives.

The observed data would be compatible
with dominant inheritance, assuming reduced penetrance, only if gross underreporting occurred for parents and seconddegree relatives. The frequency data in the
various groups of relatives do not by themselves lead to any firm conclusion concerning the nature of the genetic component for
CHD; it is plausible that polygenic and
dominant types occur.

EFFECT OF FAMILY HISTORY
ON THE RISK OF CHD

A feature of polygenic inheritance, as contrasted with recessive inheritance, is the influence of a family history of the trait on the
risk of the trait in the sibs of the propositi.
If the parents are normal, the expected frequency of an autosomal recessive trait in the
sibs of the propositi is 25% regardless of the
presence or absence of the trait in any other
relative. Assuming polygenic inheritance
and complete heritability, propositi will
vary as to the number of genes they possess
above the threshold number; their normal
parents will vary as to the number of genes
they possess below the threshold number.
The higher the number of genes possessed
by the parents, the higher the probability
that their child will have the trait. Propositi with affected close relatives likely
have more of the genes than propositi with
no affected relatives. Furthermore, the
higher the number of genes possessed by the
propositi, the higher the probability they
will have an affected sib.

A positive family history of CHD would
also increase the frequency of CHD in the
sibs of the propositi if the disorder was determined in some cases by a dominant gene

Social Biology

showing reduced penetrance and in other
cases by exogenous factors. A positive
family history of CHD would tend to distinguish propositi with the dominant gene
from the exogenous types; the responsible
gene would then be expected to occur in
one-half of their sibs.

The overall data suggest that a familyhistory effect does exist for CHD (see Table
3). The frequency of affected sibs in the absence of a family history is 3.28% (n=
579); it is increased to 5.66% (n = 318) if
there is a positive family history of CHD.
The frequency of affected sibs is 5.84% (n =
291) if the parents were reported to be normal but some other relative had the disorder. The difference in frequency values in
the sibs of the male propositi with and without a family history of CHD is statistically
significant in support of the existence of a
family-history effect (11.54% [x = 52] vs.
2.56% [n = 117]). Although possessing the
sign specified by the family-history effect,
the difference in the frequency of CHD in
the sibs of the two types of female propositi
is not significant (4.51% [n = 266] vs.
3.46% [n = 462]).

The data for the male propositi, but not
those for the female propositi, support the
concept that an affected sib increases the
frequency of CHD in the other relatives (see
Table 3). The frequency of CHD in the
other relatives (parents, second- and thirddegree relatives) of the propositi is 2.41%
(x = 166) when a sib is affected; it is decreased to 0.82% in these relatives of the
male propositi when a sib is not affected.
This difference is statistically significant.
The respective values for the relatives of the
female propositi are 0.59% (# = 846) and
0.66% (n = 6,962).

One possible explanation for the observation that a family history effect is more profound for male propositi than female propositi is that CHD is more genetically
determined in males than females, i.e., for a
given genotype, exogenous factors have a

greater influence in females than males in
determining whether CHD will occur.

EFFECT OF SEX ON THE RISK oF CHD

Sex-modified polygenic inheritance is
characterized by the more frequent hereditary transmission of the trait by the sex
showing the lower population incidence of
the trait (Carter, 1961). In the general pop
ulation of Utah, as in other Caucasian populations, the sex ratio of CHD is about 5 to
1 in favor of females (Woolf and Turner,
1969). This marked sexual difference makes
CHD a candidate for this type of inheritance. If a male with CHD possesses more
of these genes, on the average, than afemale,
there would be an increased probability that
the threshold is exceeded in his close relaDownloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:54 08 December 2015

tives. The frequency of CHD would also be
higher in the close relatives of male propositi
than female propositi if the disorder were
more genetically determined in males than
females.

Although no differences are statistically
significant, the close relatives of the male
propositi do show an increased frequency of
CHD. The male propositi have a higher frequency of affected sibs than the female propositi (5.33% [n = 169] vs. 3.85% [n =
728]). A higher frequency is also present in
the other relatives (parents, second- and
third-degree relatives) of the male propositi
than the corresponding relatives of the female propositi (0.88% [nz = 1,924] vs. 0.64%
[n = 8,629}).

HERITABILITY OF CHD

Etiologic heterogeneity for CHD implies
that genetic and nongenetic variation exists
between affected and nonaffected individuals. Falconer (1965) developed a method for
estimating heritability values for anomalies
showing polygenic inheritance which employs the incidence of the disorder in the
general population and the frequency in
various groups of relatives. In the absence
of nonadditive genetic variance, heritability
(h?) is defined as the proportion of the total
variance due to genetic differences between
affected and nonaffected individuals.

Using incidence values of 0.02% and
0.10% for males and females, respectively,
for the state of Utah (Woolf and Turner,
1969), Falconer’s method applied to sibs
(for which the frequency values are the most
reliable) yields heritability values of about
82% and 58% for males and females, respectively. This method gives heritability
values that are biased upwards if dominance
or interaction between genes at different loci
is present or if there are common family
environmental factors of etiologic importance; however, even though the reliability
of each estimate is in doubt, the difference
between the two estimates does suggest that

Social Biology

exogenous factors are more important for
females than males.

EFFECT OF BREECH MALPOSITION
ON THE RISK OF CHD

Some cases of CHD might be classified
as inborn errors of metabolism (Andren and
Borglin, 1960, 1961¢, 19618; Wilkinson,
1963). A developing fetus receives estrone
and progesterone across the placenta. The
fetal adrenal glands also produce progesterone, and the fetal ovaries produce estrone.
These hormones produce minor degrees of
joint laxity by their direct action on fetal
ligaments. These hormones also stimulate
the fetal uterus to produce a relaxin which
accounts further for the greater degree of
joint laxity in females. An enzyme system
present in the normal fetal liver converts
estrone and progesterone to inactive products which enter the maternal circulation
and are excreted. A failure of this enzyme
system may result in generalized ligamentous laxity which could initiate the chain of
events leading to CHD.

Experimental work with rabbits has implicated the etiologic interaction of breech
malposition and stress of hormones. Wilkinson (1963) splinted the hind limbs of young
rabbits in breech malposition and stressed
them with injections of estrone and progesterone. The females, but not the males, developed generalized joint laxity and atraumatic dislocation of the hip, resembling
human congenital dislocation of the hip.
Control rabbits, which were bound but not
injected, showed neither joint laxity nor
atraumatic dislocation. These results suggest that breech malposition in man may
increase the likelihood of a hip disorder in
those individuals with generalized joint
laxity.

Quasi-continuous variation for CHD
would imply that a fetus with only a small
number of the responsible genes (mildly predisposed to CHD) might demonstrate the
disorder if stressed with breech malposition

Vol. 18, No. 1

while a fetus with a large number might develop the disorder even with a normal cephalic position. According to this type of
inheritance, propositi who were nonbreech
cases should possess, on the average, more
of the genes than propositi who were breech
cases. Furthermore, the extreme stress of
malposition may be the exogenous factor
which induces CHD in a fetus lacking a given genotype responsible for the disorder in a
certain proportion of nonbreech cases.

The data (see Table 3) are compatible
with the hypothesis that close relatives of
breech cases have a lower frequency of CHD
than the close relatives of nonbreech cases,
in support of the existence of a breech-malposition effect. However, again, the effect is
more noticeable for male propositi than female propositi. The chi-square values for
males border each side of the significance
line while those for the females are substantially below the line. All differences have the
sign specified by the breech-malposition effect. The frequencies of CHD in the sibs of
the propositi who were nonbreech and
breech cases, are 4.33% (n = 832) and
1.54% (n= 65), respectively. The frequency of CHD in the other relatives (parents, second- and third-degree relatives) of
the propositi who were nonbreech and
breech cases are 0.73% (n = 9,340) and
0.33% (x = 1,213), respectively.

MATERNAL EFFECT

Instability of the pelvis, similar to generalized pelvic instability observed in infants with congenital hip disease, is not
uncommon in pregnant women (Andren and
Borglin, 1960). If the pelvic ligaments of
some pregnant women are overly relaxed,
the fetus may have an increased probability
of being delivered in the breech position.
Furthermore, a hormone upset in the mother during pregnancy may expose the developing fetus to an excess of estrone and progesterone. If CHD has a maternal effect

 

Congenital Hip Disease 15

component, then the offspring of the brothers and sisters of the mothers of the propositi might vary as to the frequency of the

‘disorder, with a higher frequency occurring

in the sisters’ offspring. This difference is
not observed. The frequency of CHD in the
sisters’ children is 0.75% (n = 1,466); the
frequency in the brothers’ children is 0.76%
(n = 1,452). It is concluded from these data
that no evidence exists for a maternal effect
for CHD.

EFFECT OF THE SEASON OF BIRTH
ON THE RISK OF CHD

A previous study based on 476 CHD
cases demonstrated that in Utah a significantly increased number of cases are born
during the autumn and early winter months
(September through January). A season of
birth effect for CHD has been well identified
in the literature (Record and Edwards,
1958; Bailar and Gurian, 1965). Some exogenous factor such as temperature or cyclic
maternal hormones may increase the probability of occurrence of CHD during the
autumn and early winter months. The Utah
data were used to test the hypothesis that
cases born during the September-January
period of the year are less genetically determined than those born during the FebruaryAugust period.

Although the chi-square values are not
significant, it is perhaps noteworthy that all
the differences have the sign specified by the
season of birth effect (see Table 3). Using
the magnitudes of the frequency values and
differences as criteria, it is again noteworthy
that the effect is more profound for the relatives of the male propositi than the relatives of the female propositi. The frequency
of CHD in the sibs of the propositi born during the February-August and SeptemberJanuary periods are 4.88% (nm = 480) and
3.42% (n = 476) respectively. The corresponding frequency values for the other relatives are 0.76% (n = 4,940) and 0.66%
(n = 5,578).

FREQUENCY OF CHD IN SIBS BORN
SUBSEQUENT TO THE PROPOSITI

In the present study, the overall frequency of CHD in the sibs of propositi is
4.12%. This value would not be appropriate
for genetic counseling if there is a tendency
for parents to terminate the sibship after
the birth of a child with CHD. Any such
tendency results in empiric-risk values that
are biased downwards; for example, if all
sibships were terminated after the birth of
an affected child, the empiric risk value
would be zero.

A total of 418 sibs were born subsequent
to the propositi; 25 of these had CHD,
giving an empiric risk value of 5.98%. The
frequency of a given anomaly will be greater
in subsequent sibs than total sibs of the propositi when there is a tendency to restrict
reproduction following the birth of the propositus and also if the risk of the anomaly
increases with advancing parental age. Both
effects may exist for CHD. Record and Edwards (1958) and Woolf et al., (1968) observed that CHD cases tend to be first-born
children regardless of maternal age, but
there is also a tendency for an increased incidence in children born to mothers over 35
years of age. Hence, both a birth-order effect
and a maternal age effect may exist for
CHD.

Genetic counseling for CHD should consider the effect of nongenetic factors. For
example, an examination of the frequency
values in Table 3 leads to the conclusion
that in Utah the risk of CHD in subsequent

Social Biology

sibs is highest if the propositus was a male
with a family history of CHD who was a
nonbreech case born during the FebruaryAugust period of the year. It is lowest if the
propositus was a female without a family
history of CHD who was a breech case born
during the September-January period of
the year.

CONCLUSIONS

Etiologic heterogeneity exists for congenital hip disease. Both genetic and nongenetic factors influence the probability
that this anomaly will occur. With existing
data, a definitive statement cannot be made
as to the nature of the genetic component;
polygenic and dominant types may occur.

It is proposed that the risk of congenital
hip disease in the sibs of a propositus with
this disorder is influenced by the sex of the
propositus, family history of the disorder,
whether the propositus was a breech or nonbreech case, and in Utah the season of birth
of the propositus.

Exogenous factors play a more important
role in females than males in determining
whether congenital hip disease will occur;
hence, this disorder is more genetically determined in males than females. Nongenetic
factors should be considered when genetic
counseling is done for congenital hip disease.
