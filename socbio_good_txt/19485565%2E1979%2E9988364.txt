The authors, commenting on our earlier
paper, begin by indicating that the use of
grade point data as a proxy for intelligence
is “laudable.” For them, it then becomes
“rather tenuous,” and finally “simply not
warranted.” In view of the very narrow
band of differences reported in IQ by
Zajonc and Markus (not exceeding the
standard error of measurement) we believe
this to be an acceptable alternative test of
the Zajonc notion. We recognize that IQ
and GPA are not the same; however, we
believe the GPA to be a better measure of
outcome because it is a better performance
indicator.

It is true that our article does not discuss
the Zajonc-Markus model in detail, but
the fact that the confluence model has
been generally published and read reduces
the need for a recounting of that which is
so generally well known in the area of
family size and birth order.

Much is made of the intellectual level
which develops within the environment of
the siblings and parents, and Howell and
Malone quote Zajonc and Markus that

“family size must have a depressing effect
on intellectual level... .” Why must it?
Older children may teach younger siblings
and be culturally enriching rather than
depriving. This case may be made as well
as the former.

We did not treat spacing because (1)
Zajonc did not in his earlier work and (2)
preliminary analysis indicated it made no
sense theoretically or empirically. We
tested the first model in our paper. The
criticism of Table 2 is handled in Table 3,
where GPA is separated out for family size
and birth order.

While social class does not account for
as much of the difference in GPA as we
expected, we do not allow that the
“Zajonc and Markus theory seems to work
well ignoring social class.” One can’t ignore the social class bias in the IQ tests.

Social class was arrived at using the
McGuire S.E.I. table which uses as the
determining variables occupation, education, income, and religion, weighted by 4,
4, 3, and 1 respectively. We should have
spelled that out in our article.

Our short article did not treat the topic inasmuch as they differed from those of
in the detail it deserves, but we felt it Zajonc and Markus. Howell and Malone
important to report our preliminary results certainly have not yet dissuaded us.
