Sequential Aspects of Spontaneous
Abortion: Maternal Age, Parity, and
Pregnancy Compensation Artifact

Alfred F. Naylor

 

National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke

National Institutes of Health
Bethesda, Maryland

At least three hypotheses predict that
spontaneous abortion risk differs during
reproductive history. It has been hypothesized that (1) genuine maternal-age effects
change individual risks, (2) genuine birthorder effects change individual risks, and
that (3) variant individual risks, which are
really independent of both age and parity,
produce an artifactual association of risk
with age in populations of women.

The availability of large numbers of reproductive histories recorded on magnetic
tape by the Collaborative Study on Cerebral Palsy offers an opportunity to weigh
these hypotheses. The original intent of the
present project was to follow the lead of
James (1963) in trying to pit the age and
artifact hypotheses against each other.
However, examination of the results suggests that parity effects are especially important.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The information was gathered between
mid-1959 and mid-1966 by thirteen hospitals, mostly east of the Mississippi. Random
samples of essentially all women registering
in the obstetric clinics of the collaborating

institutions entered the study. Generally,
the women came from poorer urban areas.
Therefore, several ethnic groups, especially
Negroes, are heavily represented. General
characteristics of the study population and
methods of sampling have been fully described by Niswander and Gordon (1972).
The prior reproductive history was, by
protocol, to be taken during the first visit
to a clinic for prenatal care, although emergencies could cause postponements. The
duration of the study permitted repeat
pregnancies. However, our data are taken
from the interviews at first. registrations
only. At this time, women had prior reproductive histories of varying lengths as summarized in Table 1.1 Fetal deaths occurring
before 20 weeks gestation are scored as
spontaneous abortions.

The histories used are anamnestic and

1The eligibility requirements for the various
tables are responsible for the apparently variant
counts in women from table to table. Any registrant on whom information was available was
included in Table 1. Any registrant giving information about at least one prior pregnancy was
eligible for Table 2. A woman must have had at
least one prior abortion and also at least one prior
live birth to be included in Table 3. A woman had
to be included in Table 3 and have had at least
3 prior pregnancies for inclusion in Table 4.

not completed; also, each was ascertained
through a pregnancy which succeeds the
history as used. The Collaborative Study
pregnancies through which these reproductive histories were ascertained are themselves biased against being spontaneous
abortions. Registration usually occurred
late in gestation, and early abortions were
frequently missed. Early registrants who
aborted at home could be lost if they did
not voluntarily report back to the clinic.
It is disappointing not to be able to use
prenatally recorded pregnancies along with
anamnestic data. The need to omit these
later pregnancies tends to reduce the range
of maternal ages. However, with respect to
reliability of the data, a test showed that
the women’s recall was about 93 per cent
accurate and unbiased.

In the present paper, the data will be
analyzed so as to yield broad comparative
evaluations of the maternal age, parity, and
artifact hypotheses. Detailed conditional
risks will be dealt with in another paper.

AGE TRENDS

The first question is whether the data
give evidence of age trends, real or artifactual. Table 2 displays by ethnic categories
the reported outcome of last pregnancy
prior to registering in the Collaborative
Study. The choice of penultimate-only
pregnancy had the effects of shortening
recall period, of weighting women equally,
and of using data from later ages (which
are sparse here).

The practice of transforming binomial

proportions before regression analysis has
been well established by Fisher and Yates
(1957). The choice of transformation is not
critical (Naylor, 1964), and in this paper
logits are used. When the logit transforms
of abortion risks are regressed on maternal
age, the linear component is positive and
significant at the 1 per cent level in every
ethnic group. In all categories except
Negro, the fit to such a simple model, as
judged by chi-square for deviations, is quite
adequate. Fit in the Negro case is disturbed
by the high rate among 13-year-olds and
the low rate among 37-year-olds. High
abortion risk in extremely young women is
not surprising. Aside from that, the 37year-old Negro sample is the only one in
all of Table 2 to depart markedly from
the trend of increased risk at higher age.

BIRTH ORDER DEFECTS

In his original paper, James (1963)
used a small number of reproductive histories obtained through the Kinsey Institute. The women had been interviewed
after age 36, and the histories were complete. As with James’ data, primary analysis here employs Slater’s (1962) rank order statistic on a group of histories, which
in this case are not complete but are more
numerous than James’.

If in a history of NV pregnancies, the mth
one is an abortion and there are no age or
parity effects, then we expect S = (m —
1)/(N —1) to have a discontinuous rectangular distribution with a mean of 0.5
and variance of (N -++ 1)/12(N — 1). With

a large number of histories, the weighted
mean of S (using the reciprocal of each
variance as a weight) would have a nearly
normal distribution with expectation of 0.5
and variance equal to the reciprocal of the
sum of the weights. In longer histories,
more than one abortion may occur. The
procedure to follow for » abortions is to
take the arithmetic mean of the 7 birth orders and to compute the variance (squared
standard error) on the basis that each such
mean is drawn from a finite population of
size N (Hald, 1952). The formula for

the variance is (WN +-1)(N —n)/12n(N
— 1).

Application of these formulas to the Collaborative Study yields the results in Table 3. In every ethnic category the observed
mean value of Slater’s statistic exceeds its
expected value of 0.5; every standardized
deviation has a negligibly small probability
when tested against the normal distribution. The conclusion is that spontaneous
abortions tend to come late in a reproductive history. One other indication that random rank distribution cannot be assumed

is in the heterogeneity chi-square which is
significant except for Puerto Ricans.
Another weaker way to approach the sequential problem is by the use of the wellknown runs test (Siegel, 1956). As with
Slater’s statistic, variance-weighted means

is a deficiency of runs of spontaneous abortions, which means that live births and
spontaneous abortions come in strings or
clumps. Jn predominantly short sequences,
the clumps must be at the beginning or
end. Because of the results in Table 3, the
strings of spontaneous abortions are obviously biased toward the end of reproductive
histories. Within the histories as recalled
by women registrants, the late-in-sequence
tendency could be due to aging, parity
effects, or memory bias.

Histories of two prior pregnancies were
taken to determine the importance of memory bias. The women were young (since
they recalled the first two pregnancies at

memory bias produced the apparent effect,
then displacement of a single recalled abortion toward higher parity should increase
with length of history. This is not true in
Table 5. For sequences of size 4, early occurrence (XO O00 and OX OO ) percentages total 42.6 for whites and 31.1 for
Negroes as compared to 39.3 and 34.7 for
XO histories. A test reported later also
discloses no bias.

A direct memory test also discloses no
bias. As noted earlier, study registration of
different pregnancies for the same woman
was possible. At each registration, past
reproductive history, as recalled, was recorded. Consistency of recall was therefore

from 110 to 104 from first to second recall,
there is no evidence of bias toward recall
at higher parity with lapse of time.

For the two-pregnancy histories, parity
is a reasonable explanation of the effect
while maternal age is not. The cases in
Table 5 are not habitual aborters so that no
form of an artifact hypothesis is applicable.

Another type of bias seems possible: that
one kind of history spans a shorter time
from the beginning of the very first pregnancy to registration in the Collaborative
Study. The pregnancy spacing is the key.
It has been estimated for the two kinds of
histories, which are diagrammed in Fig88.2 per cent. The tabulations are too cumbersome
to present, but the inconsistent reports are bal
anced so that the average recalled parity of a
spontaneous abortion stays constant.

ure 1, The estimated durations are the
same to within a fraction of a week; total
duration therefore cannot be biasing.

One other attempt to explain the apparent parity effect might be based on
length of gestation at registration in the
Collaborative Study. Women with the OX
kind of history might be thought to register earlier so that at least those who abort
during the study pregnancy are less likely
to be lost. Table 7 shows XO and OX

frequency breakdowns by registration at
less than 20 weeks and 20 or more weeks
gestation (when known). Among white
women there is no hint of such bias, and
the sampling variability easily explains the
difference among Negroes.

PREGNANCY COMPENSATION

If it were true that all apparent maternal
age or parity effects were due to continued
reproduction of women with high abortion
risk, then (1) there should be no increased
risk of abortion with matemal age or parity
in women with no prior abortions, and (2)
women pregnant at later ages, or parities,
should be disproportionately those with
previous abortions.

Social Biology

To investigate the first question, data
(not shown here) were tabulated for the
recalled outcome at parity 2 and parity 3
in women with no history of abortion. Unfortunately, this sample includes few
women over 35 and is not entirely satisfactory for investigating maternal age effect.
However, in both whites and Negroes a significant regression of abortion frequency
(after logit transformation) was present at
both parities. This regression had a significant parabolic component in whites, but
not in Negroes. The high abortion rate in
whites at very young ages might reflect
induced abortions. Table 2 suggests that
this is also true for Negroes, except that
the ages involved are even younger.

Of course, the proportion of women with
at least one previous spontaneous abortion
increases with maternal age and parity.
Such an increase would be seen for any
event which might occur even at random
in a reproductive history, for example, the
proportion of women who have been in a
car accident. However, the converse situation does provide a test of the artifact hypothesis. If the hypothesis is correct, then
women with at least one abortion should,
for a constant gravidity, be older on the
average than women with no abortions.
Relevant data are shown in Table 8.
Women who had 2 or 3 pregnancies prior
to the one registered in the Collaborative
Study are tabulated by age (dichotomy at
30 years) at last prior pregnancy and by
histories antecedent to the last prior pregnancy.

Surprisingly, the white data show a definite trend contrary to expectation under
the pregnancy compensation hypothesis.
Though not significant in the “O” (liveborn) versus “XX” (abortion) contrast, the
lowering trend in maternal age with prior
abortion experience is significant for the
longer histories. Equally surprising is the
apparent positive finding in the Negro data.

The latter is surprising because maternal
age artifact would seem largely dependent
on effective contraception in the population.

MULTIPLE REGRESSION ON AGE
AND PARITY

Since evidence is absent that pregnancy
compensation occurred in the white Collaborative Study population, further analysis
of age and parity effects is possible; similar
methods were used on the Negro data, but
conclusions will be less secure.

First, the data shown in Table 2 were
retabulated with breakdowns by parity as
well as maternal agt. Because fetal deaths
occurring in women of early-teen age are
too likely to be unacknowledged induced

abortions, only data for maternal ages 19
or higher were used.

Multivariate logit analyses were performed to evaluate the predictive values of
parity, maternal age, their cross-product,
and their squares. Parity squared was the
only nonsignificant term (1 per cent level
or lower), and the model without it entailed nonsignificant deviations from regression. When the constant multiplying
maternal age is not estimated (Model I,
Table 9), the linear age term is positive.
This fact is noted so that it is understood
that the more complete Model II describes
a risk accelerated by maternal age at lower
parities. The parity term is positive in both
models. However, the negative parity by
maternal age interaction suggests that the
elderly primigravidas were at high risk in
this white sample.

The Negro data show the parity effect;
but these women are generally younger
than the whites so that real age effect may
be largely inoperative. The result is also
lower predictability for Negroes as judged
by the percentage of total chi-square accounted for by logit regression constants.

STATISTICAL STUDIES OF
ABORTION RISK

Similar evidence for both parity and maternal age effects on abortion risk occurs
in the study by Warburton and Fraser
(1964). The Montreal data made parental
age seem more important than the Collaborative Study data do. However, the women
in the older study were ascertained through
a live birth which could have been in the
middle of the reproductive history so that
data for pregnancies at later age were relatively more common, The parity effect was
evident even though full weight was given
to parental age by estimating effects of
both mother’s and father’s ages. Despite
differences in ethnic and socioeconomic
bases, the data of Warburton and Fraser

(1964) lead to nearly the same conclusions
as the Cerebral Palsy data.

The failure of James (1963) to find the
parity effect for which he was directly testing is puzzling. His data are not adequately
detailed in his paper so that the reason for
conflicting conclusion is left open. It could
be sample size (smaller for James), analytic
difference (inverse variance weighting not
used by James), or population base (James’
women were older, post-reproductive, and
not obviously ascertained through pregnancy outcome). James does probe for positive evidence of age artifact. He reasons
that if habitual aborters do attempt to compensate, they should have more pregnancies
in completed family histories, such as he
used. He then defines a habitual aborter as
a woman with 30 per cent or more abortion
experience. In his sample, such “abortionprone” women have a higher mean number
of pregnancies than “abortion-resistant”
women.

However, a woman with only one pregnancy would have a 100 per cent abortion
rate, while a woman with two pregnancies
would require a 50 per cent abortion rate
to be “abortion-prone.” A three-pregnancy
woman must abort only 33 per cent of the
time to be “abortion-prone.” The mean
number of pregnancies are 2.79 for the

“abortion-prone,” and 2.42 for the “abortion-resistant” in James’ sample. This difference is clearly a byproduct of the definition of ‘“abortion-proneness.”

Roberts (1964) examines data found in
the literature for family size effect in terms
of the double binomial distribution which
was also fitted by James. The theory of
this distribution involves the assumption
of two groups—a high-risk abortion-prone
class of womeh and a low-risk abortionresistant class. However, it seems unreasonable to suppose that women are divisible
into two well defined high-risk and low-risk
Classes. I would take the Warburton and
Fraser (1964) position that there are many
gradations among women in abortion risk.
In fact, James (1963) found that the negative binomial distribution which makes
this latter assumption usually gave a serviceable fit to such data. If negative binomials gave good fits to the data used by
Roberts, the practical constancy of overall
risk with respect to family size would be a
strong argument against James’ artifact
hypothesis.

Shapiro et al. (1962) make an observation confirming a nonartifactual age effect.
They report that among primigravidas in
the Health Insurance Plan of New York
fetal death risk (mostly in first 19 weeks

of pregnancy) is highest for those 35 and
older.

BIOLOGICAL CAUSES OF ABORTION

Warburton and Fraser (1964) reached
very similar conclusions to Shapiro et al.
(1962), and their review of the literature

_ 4s still quite pertinent. The great likelihood

that fetal chromosomal anomalies cause
spontaneous abortions and the problems of
judging their importance have been stated
by an international committee (WHO,
1966). Trisomies appear to be factors and
do depend on maternal age. In more recent
papers, Bowen and Lee (1969), suspect
triploidy to be implicated, while Carr
(1971) does not. Doepfner (1962) and
Niendorf (1964) have suggested that polyspermy is a factor.

Although maternal chromosomal aberrations, which would cause constant high
risk, may be of some importance (Wingate,
1965), the consanguinity study of Slatis
et al. (1958) indicates that segregation of
deleterious recessive alleles is not contributory.

That diabetic women are abortion prone
has been known for some time (Dekaban
and Baird, 1955), and it is believed (Eastman and Hellman, 1961) that the effect
increases with maternal age.

The birth-order effect detected here
would result if women can become sensitized to paternal antigens or have some
other change inflicted as a result of sexual
intercourse and/or carriage of fetuses. On
the other hand, in a study of liveborn children from the Collaborative Study, we
(Warburton and Naylor, 1971) tentatively
reached the conclusion that beneficial hypertrophy might be a consequence of sensitization to paternal antigens. An attempt
is being made to amass data on this latter
point.

Basing his remarks largely on rodent
studies, Simmons (1969) reviews the ana

tomical and _ serological considerations
which attend regarding the fetus as an
allograft subject to immunologic attack by
the mother. Rowley et al. (1963) in a
thorough-going study of 34 high-risk aborters were unable to find any correlate with
risk; however, the newer histocompatibility tests were not available then.

ABO blood type appears to be a factor
in fetal death (Golovachev and Bokarius,
1971; Peritz, 1971). The data of Peritz, in
particular, imply mother-fetus interaction.
However, if sensitization is important, then
female B and male A matings should be at
the same high risk as female O and male A
matings; but they do not seem to be.

Naib et al. (1970) found elevated abortion risk in women with genital herpetic
infection. Aurelian et al. (1971) recently
isolated herpesvirus from cervical tumor
cells; cervical infection is apparently the
result of sexual activity, since cervical cancer is rare among nuns. The important
parity effect demonstrated here could be
due to blood type incompatibility, transplantation incompatibility, or persistent
viral infection.

SUMMARY

Reproductive histories of women registered in the Collaborative Study on Cerebral Palsy were studied. The data clearly
showed that among women with histories
mixing spontaneous abortions and live
births, risk of abortion was greater at
higher parity. Although the women sampled
tended to be young, an increase of risk with
age was demonstrated in the white sample.
These effects were not due to sample
biases. Negro age effects were possibly confounded with pregnancy compensation artifact which can mimic aging influence in
unselected samples.
