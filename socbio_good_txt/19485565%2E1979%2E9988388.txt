ABSTRACT: This paper focuses on a set of substantive and methodological problems in the study of
family-size preferences. Substantively, we ask whether traditional social-demographic variables explain proportionately more or less variance in family-size preferences during the mid-1970’s than
during the period following World War II. Additionally, we inquire whether individual variables,
such as race, religion, education, and community size, perform differently in recent years than they
did in the postwar period. Methodologically, we question whether analogous trends emerge from
including diverse indicators of family-size preferences. Using Multiple Classification Analysis, we
find no diminution over the time period in the proportion of variance explained by the socialdemographic predictors considered. In fact, these variables appear to increase in predictive power
over time. However, some variables have clearly changed in marginal importance since World War
II. Religious affiliation and community size have declined, and race has increased. Educational
level has maintained a major position throughout. Finally, the differentials in reproductive preferences are very congruent regardiess of the dependent variable used—family-size ideals, prefer
ences, intentions, or ideals for the average American family.

Over the past thirty-five years demographers have tried to show that social and
demographic variables are powerful predictors of family-size preferences. On the
whole, this effort has been disappointing.
Although religious, racial, educational,
occupational, and residential divisions
have produced some differences in familysize desires, the amount of variance explained has typically been small and 1s believed to be diminishing. As long age as
1962, Ronald Freedman remarked on the
declining role of the “‘traditional’’ differentials in family-size preferences (Freedman, 1962). It is now commonplace to assume that social and demographic
predictors of reproductive variation have
continued to lose importance (Westoff
and Westoff, 1971). Indeed, one of the
most frequent justifications for new approaches to studying fertility is that the
traditional variables have lost most of

their explanatory power (e.g., Turchi,
1975). For example, stimulated by microeconomic theory concerning fertility,
demographers have increasingly evoked
as predictors various measures of income
and other economic indicators (Freedman, 1963; Mincer, 1963; Easterlin, 1969;
Cain and Weininger, 1973).

However, no systematic trend analysis
of predictors of family-size desires, using
modern multivariate techniques, exists.
Hence, it is unclear whether the explanatory power of social and demographic variables actually has diminished over time.
Do traditional predictors in fact explain
less variance in reproductive preferences
today than they did, say, during the post—
World War II period? Which predictors
are the most promising? Do their effects
on family-size preferences remain constant over time? The preseni paper is designed to address these questions. It is

stimulated by the conviction that we need
to reassess, quantitatively, which types of
fertility predictors are important today as
against the past—in this case, the period
following World War II. It is our suspicion
that the study of population is accumulating a great deal of “‘theory”’ about some
predictors that may have little explanatory
power, while at the same time it is neglecting others whose track record may be
more impressive. In this report we have
confined ourselves to a consideration of
trends in the importance of selected predictors over time. An analysis of trends in
the nature of these relationships will be
forthcoming.

We have utilized a series of Gallup surveys on ideal family size between 1945 and
1977—17 surveys in all—to analyze possible changes in the socioeconomic predictors of family-size preferences. This series
on family-size preferences is the longest
available for national samples of the U.S.
population of both sexes and voting age.
Additionally, we wished to validate our
findings by analyzing other measures of
family-size preferences from five national
fertility surveys conducted in the United
States between 1955 and 1973. These surveys are described in the following section. All of the data sets have been analyzed using AID (Automatic Interaction
Detector) and MCA (Multiple Classification Analysis).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The rational Gallup surveys used here
all contained the same question on family
size preferences: ‘“‘What do you consider
the ideal size of a family—a husband,
wife, and how many children?”’ Most of
the studies also included comparable data
on selected predictor variables—trace, religion, education, occupation, family income, and community size in addition to
age and sex. Hence, taking account of

Family-size Preferences

303

some possibly confounding demographic
factors such as age and sex, we can study
major social and demographic differentials in family-size preferences over
time. We can also examine the importance
of income in view of the theoretical interest in this variable. Occupation of the
chief wage earner as a predictor was
dropped from the regressions because a
high proportion of older respondents were
retired (and no occupational data were
available for them), and the marginal importance of occupation was very slight for
all of the surveys. The marginal importance of marital status was also so slight
that it was not worth including in the regressions. Because some of the surveys,
dating from the 1940’s and 1950’s, did not
include one or more predictor variables,
we have also presented a time series based
on those data that were available from the
earlier period through 1977.

The five fertility surveys were stratified
national samples of women in the reproductive ages (15-49). The 1955 and 1960
Growth of American Families studies and
the 1965 National Fertility Study were
based on surveys of currently married women. The 1970 National Fertility Study included ever-married women and the 1973
National Survey of Family Growth was
based on single and ever-married women.
In order to insure comparability among
the fertility surveys, we analyzed only currently married women.

The fertility surveys contained a variety
of questions concerning the dependent
variable, family-size preference. These
questions will be discussed in detail in a later section. The predictor variables were
similar to those in the Gallup surveys, except that the fertility studies allow us to
use husband’s income rather than family
income. The latter is believed by some to
confound income effects (Mincer, 1963;
Easterlin, 1969; Cain and Weininger,
1973).

The research questions we have posed
are answered most efficiently through the
use of multiple-regression techniques. We
have employed Multiple Classifcation
Analysis (MCA), an elaboration of
“dummy variable” multiple-regression
analysis (Andrews et al., 1973), which allows for categorical variables as well as numerical values. The method makes no assumptions about linearity and can
demonstrate possible nonlinearities as a
normal feature of its operation. However,
since MCA assumes a high degree of additivity, it is not appropriate to analyze
data in which there are major interactions
unless it 1s possible to construct interaction variables. In order to detect interactions and other anomalies, we first analyzed all of the surveys with AID
(Automatic Interaction Detector) (Sonquist et al., 1973; Sonquist, 1970). The
AID analyses, plus MCA tabulations,
showed some of the Gallup studies to be
interactive and some clearly additive. For
each of the interactive surveys, the anomalies were taken into account through interaction terms. In all, ten Gallup studies
emerged that were either additive or
nearly so.

In the presentations that follow, the R?
(adjusted for degrees of freedom) is given
for all of the studies, including those
where interaction terms have been used.
The remaining analyses assess the importance of particular predictors. Unfortunately, the importance is difficult to evaluate when a variable in question is part of
an interaction term. Indeed, if a true interaction exists, then the variables interacting do not have separate identities,
and their effects should not be assessed independently. Consequently, for assessing
unique effects, we used the ten Gallup
polls where the additivity assumption was
justified and, hence, no complex interaction terms were required. The same procedure was used to analyze the fertility
studies. Only one was deemed interactive.

Social Biology

We are concerned here with the proportion of the variance in family-size preferences (R?) we can “‘explain’”’ by socialdemographic variables and how this
changes over time. However, a change in
R? may occur for a number of reasons. For
example, there may be a shift in the variance of the dependent variable. A great
deal of dispersion in the dependent variable will, other things being equal, increase
the probability that a given set of predictors will be able to explain a high proportion of this variance, whereas a diminution
in the dispersion of this variable may require a very fine explanatory net in order
to generate much power. Conversely, a
change in the variability of the predictors
can alter their ability to explain variance.
By the same token, a change in the intercorrelation among predictors may also
change the proportionate level of explanation. Finally, an overall change in R? can
come about because the importance of individual predictors (the zero-order correlation with the dependent variable) shifts
over time. In the course of the discussion
that follows, we shall see that R? has
differed because particular variables have
changed in unique importance.

RESULTS
THE GALLUP SURVEYS

Compared with the early post-WorldWar-II period, what proportion of the variance in family-size preferences can be explained thirty years later by traditional social-demographic variables—age, sex,
race, religion, education, and community
size? What is the independent contribution of each of these predictors to explained variance? Has their marginal importance changed over time? And, finally,
what is gained in explanatory power by
adding an economic variable such as family income?

plained variance for 17 Gallup surveys according to three models. The first model
includes all of the basic background variables. Models 2 and 3 are shown for additive surveys only, and where the designated predictors were available. In Model
2 the number of predictors was cut to the
five having temporal priority in the life cycle—age, sex, race, current religious
affiliation, and education. Model 3 includes those variables for which we have
predictors as far back in time as 1943.
Turning first to the changing importance of traditional background factors as
predictors of family-size preferences, in
Model 1 we see that proportionately more
variance was explained during the 1970’s
than in 1952 or during the 1960’s. At no
date do these variables explain much of
the variance. There is a high of 12 per cent
in 1974 and 1977, but the recent record is
better than in the early years of this series
when they accounted for no more than 6 to
8 per cent. Approximately the same proportion of variance can be explained over
the years by reducing the number of predictors to five—age, sex, race, religious
affiliation, and education (Model 2).

Again, with this model, more variance is
explained by these predictors during the
1970’s than previously. It is possible to
carry Model 3 back to 1945, and in this series we can clearly see the trend toward
greater explanatory power over time—
from 4 per cent in 1945 to 10 per cent in
1975. Although we have not computed Fratios because they are inappropriate for
national stratified samples (see Glenn,
1977, p. 42), it is unlikely that this regular
progression of increasing R? is due to
chance factors, particularly since a number of early studies have low R?’s and a
number of later ones have higher R?’s.
The increasing ability over time of
background variables to explain familysize preferences is unlikely to be due toa
change in variance in the dependent variable, family-size preferences. As may be
seen from Table 1, the variance in ideal
family size did not follow a steadily increasing course. It generally decreased
from the 1940’s to the early 1960’s, then
increased until the early 1970’s, and has
declined since then. As for changing variance in the predictors, MCA predictors
are categories (dummy variables) and

therefore have no variance in the statistical sense. We have also made the categories for each variable as comparable as
possible throughout. Hence, changes in
predictor variation are not, in this type of
analysis, responsible for changes in R’.
The problem of intercorrelation among
predictors is obviated, to a great extent,
by the fact that we use the marginal or
unique importance of independent variables throughout. Finally, changes in firstorder relations between predictors and
family-size preferences will be discussed
when the results for individual predictors
are presented.

Our results so far contradict the impression that the social-demographic variables explain less variance now than in the
past. We believe that this impression may
stem from the changing importance over
time of particular variables, a supposition
that can be tested by examining the
marginal effects of the predictors.

We assess the unique or marginal effect
of a predictor by running two regressions,
one run with and one run without the vari
able in question. The percentage change
in R? (adjusted for degrees of freedom)
shows the additional explanatory effect
achieved by adding a particular predictor.
We have added the predictors into the regression according to their temporal priority in the life cycle. We start with ascribed
characteristics such as age, sex, and race,
then add characteristics acquired early in
life, such as religious affiliation and educational level, and finally current characteristics such as community size and family
income.

A notable finding in this analysis is that
the effects of certain predictors have
changed substantially over time (Table 2).

Race. Among the ascribed characteristics, race (essentially a white/black dichotomy) has most radically changed its
marginal importance over the time period
we are considering. Prior to 1970, adding
race to age and sex in the regression 1ncreased explained variance (R?) by an
average of 8 per cent. Since 1970, race
adds over 200 per cent to explained variance (compare the first and second rows of
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

Vol. 26, No. 4

Table 2). The marked increase in the importance of race (net of other variables) as
a predictor is not simply due to the fact
that the Gallup samples have become racially more heterogeneous over time
(Glenn, 1977). Rather, it results from a
real change in the zero-order relationship
between race and family-size preferences.
Moreover, this relation does not ‘‘wash
out” when other predictors are added to
the analysis. In sum, family-size preferences of blacks and whites now differ more
than they did previously, both before and
after we have controlled for the effects of
other predictors. Looking at these data
alone, we would have to conclude that
race is a relatively promising predictor of
family-size preferences. To understand
how it operates on such preferences is of
course another matter, but to attempt
such understanding appears to be increasingly worth the effort.

Religious Affiliation. Throughout the
regressions, respondents were classified as
Catholics, Protestants, Jews, without a religious affiliation, or “other.” The “‘other”’
category is relatively small, rising from 1
per cent in 1963 to only 5 per cent in 1977.
A comparison of the second and third
rows in Table 2 demonstrates the marginal
effect of religious affiliation before and after 1970. Clearly, the unique effect of religion has declined markedly over time.
Prior to 1970, adding religion to age, sex,
and race increased the variance explained
by 104 per cent. Since 1970, the marginal
effect has declined to 35 per cent. This
trend is also present in the first-order relation of religion and family-size preferences.

Educational Level. The marginal importance of education as a predictor has
generally increased throughout the period
(Table 2). The addition of education to
age, sex, race, and religion typically raises
the variance explained after 1970 by 42 per
cent, whereas the comparable figure prior

Family-size Preferences

307

to 1970 is 29 per cent (compare the third
and fourth rows of Table 2). This result
reflects a marked rise in the zero-order relationship between schooling and familysize preferences, a relationship that is not
vitiated by the association of other predictors with education. Education, like race,
is thus a basic background predictor that
in recent years has attained uniquely important status in explaining family-size
preferences.

Community Size. The fairly large effect
community size once had on reproductive
preferences had been dissipated by the
early 1970's. Table 2 shows that this variable increased R? by 27 per cent prior to
1970 (compare the fourth and fifth rows).
Since then, this increase has diminished to
2 per cent. This closing of the rural-urban
differential (our variable distinguishes
rurality from urban communities of various sizes) in family-size preferences
reflected in the first-order relationship, together with the diminished religious
differentials, may explain the widespread
perception of an overall drop in the pre
- dictive power of sociodemographic varia
bles.

Family Income. The rationale for adding income last is that, to a large extent,
income is determined by some of the other
predictors already entered in the regression—particularly race and education.
The marginal effect of this variable is typically very low regardless of the timeperiod considered, although the zeroorder correlation rivals that of religion
(compare the fifth and sixth rows, Table
2). In other words, when temporally prior
variables such as education are taken into
account, the marginal importance of family income as a predictor of family-size
preferences is very small. We find little
support for the notion that family income
is. an important predictor in this type of
analysis.

To sum up our results so far, it seems

clear that the entire group of social and demographic predictors of family-size preferences has not lost explanatory power
over time. Actually, the group has gained
power since our first observations after
World War II, a fact that cannot be explained by the changing variance in the dependent variable. Thus, considering major social and cultural cleavages in the
society, people’s family-size preferences
have become more different over time, on
the average, rather than more similar.
However, now people differ along
different dimensions from those of the
past. We find that the marginal effects of
individual predictors have changed over
the years. Family-size preferences appear
to have become more similar across religious and rural-urban groups while becoming more different across educational
and racial groups. Family-size preferences
among income groups appear to be mainly
a function of other variables, since inclu
sion of this predictor adds very little explanatory power.

These results suggest strongly that
more attention is required to understand
the fertility differentials of the present,
rather than assuming them away because
the major cleavages of the past—religion
and rural-urban differences—are no
longer so sharp. For example, is the racial
split simply another expression of educational variability? Or are there cultural
and social components to black fertility
that may transcend, or even short-circuit,
educational attainment? Given the poor
showing of income as a predictor, must we
conclude that economic theories that relate resources to family-size desires are
poorly specified? Is it possible that
economic considerations come into play
only after the effects of other incentives
have been operative? Is it also possible
that such incentives may even cancel out
the effects of economic rationality?

INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION:
THE 1955, 1960, 1965, 1970, AND 1973
FERTILITY SURVEYS

Would findings similar to those from
the Gallup series result from using
different indicators of reproductive preference (family-size expectations or intentions instead of ideals) and differently

- composed samples (women in the repro
ductive years instead of adults of all ages
and both sexes)? As a test, we have performed a congruent analysis on the 1955
and 1960 Growth of American Families
Studies (GAF, 1955 and 1960); the 1965
and 1970 National Fertility Studies (NFS,
1965 and 1970); and the 1973 National
Survey of Family Growth (NSFG, 1973).
In all of the surveys, women were asked
about their family-size expectations or intentions. And, except in 1970, women
were asked a standard question on their
views of the ideal family size for the
average American family. It will be remembered that the Gallup question did
not refer to the average American family.

The questions on expectations/
intentions have been tabulated only for
women without known fecundity impairments. Obviously, the response to questions on expectations or intentions may be
biased by the knowledge of subfecundity
or sterility. Since there were many more
voluntary sterilizations in 1970 and 1973
than in 1955, we did not wish to bias any
possible real differences among the survey
responses because of these changes. The
question on ideal family size for the
average American family was tabulated
for both fecund women and all women.
Except for income and occupation, most
predictor variables were similar to those in
the Gallup surveys. In the fertility surveys
we were able to use husband’s income
rather than family income as suggested by
economists (Freedman, 1963; Mincer,
1963; Easterlin, 1969). Additionally, we

Family-size Preferences 309

have data on the occupations of the husbands in the fertility studies.

As with the Gallup series, we generally
find an increase rather than a decrease in
the proportional variance explained by
the background predictors at the later
dates (Table 3). This occurs despite a decline in the variance of the dependent variable since 1960. Thus, neither data set
substantiates a recent contraction in the
proportion of variance explicable by social-demographic predictors. Congruent
with the Gallup series, virtually all of the
explained variance is due to four basic predictors—race, age, religion, and education. As between Models 1 and 2, it is evident that, in recent years especially, very
little was added by husband’s income,
community size, and husband’s occupation (Table 4). This is true for the fertility
studies regardless of whether expectations
or ideals are considered. We may now
assess the contribution of individual predictors. Because of the sampling of the
black population in the earlier surveys,
strict comparability among the surveys
cannot be assured. For this reason, we do
not consider the marginal importance of
race.

Religious Affiliation. In conformity
with a temporal decline in the zero-order
importance of religion to family-size preferences, when religious affiliation is added
to age and race (Table 4), its declining
marginal importance in later years as
against 1960 is evident. With regard to expectations or intentions, in the 1960 data,
the amount of explained variance more
than triples when religious affiliation is
added to age and race, whereas a similar
addition in 1973 produces an increase of
37 per cent. The tabulations on ideal family size for the average American family in
the fertility surveys show a similar trend.
Thus, both the Gallup data and the fertility studies agree on the generally declining
marginal importance of religious

affiliation, and this finding holds in the fertility studies for both expectations and
ideals.

Education. The unique effect of education does not increase over time in the fertility surveys (Table 4); in fact, it decreases, reflecting a slight decline in the
zero-order relation. However, regardless
of the dependent variable used, the unique role of education relative to the unique role of other variables rises appreciably. For example, regarding family-size
expectations for 1960, the addition of religion caused a 341 per cent increase in R?,
whereas adding education resulted in an
additional 49 per cent increase. For 1973,
the respective figures were 37 per cent and
28 per cent. It may be that the trend results
for education in these data, as compared
with the Gallup surveys, are biased by the
fact that earlier fertility studies were
weighted in favor of more highly-educated
women.

Community Size. Congruent with the
Gallup surveys, the single-order and the
marginal effect of community size in the
fertility surveys has declined greatly. For
example, the percentage increase by virtue of adding community size to age, race,
religion, education, and husband’s occupation in 1960 was 8 per cent, whereas in
1973 it was 1 per cent. For ideals, in the
same period of time, the percentages decreased from 17 to 4 and from 23 to 6, depending on whether fecund currently married women or just currently married
women were considered.

Husband’s Occupation. Correlatively,
the role of husband’s occupation in the
fertility surveys has also declined over
time. Along with community size,
husband’s occupation has thus become a
marginally unimportant variable during
recent years.

Husbana’s Income. Finally, turning to
husband’s income, the results are congruent with those for family income on the

Family-size Preferences

311

Gallup surveys. The marginal effect of
husband’s income in the fertility surveys is
slight or nonexistent (Table 4), despite a
fairly constant zero-order relation with
family-size preferences. It does appear
that there is a slight increase in importance
in recent years, but the 1973 data still only
show a 2 per cent increase in R? from adding husband’s income to the other variables. We do not find this result surprising
since it appears that regardless of the
economic-status measure used, very little
explanation is achieved (see Curtin, 1976;
Beaujot et al., 1978).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

This paper focuses on a set of substantive and methodological problems in the
study of family-size preferences. Substantively, we ask whether traditional socialdemographic variables predict more or
less variability in family-size preferences
during the mid-1970’s than in the period
following World War II. Additionally, we
inquire whether individual variables such
as race, religion, education, and community size perform differently in recent
years than in the post-war period. We also
question whether analogous trends
emerge from using diverse indicators of
family-size preferences—personal familysize ideals, expectations, and intentions,
and ideals for the average American family.

Employing Multiple Classification
Analysis, we use two types of data sets.
Initially, we concentrate on 17 Gallup surveys spanning the period 1945 to 1977.
Each contained a question on family-size
ideals, and all included virtually identical
data on predictor variables—age, sex,
race, religious affiliation, educational
level, family income, and community size.
Then, we turn to the 1955 and 1960
Growth of American Families studies, the

and the 1973 National Survey on Family
Growth—all covering married women in
the reproductive ages. These studies, in
addition to including information on predictor variables that is analogous to the
Gallup data, contained questions on reproductive preferences that differed from
the one in Gallup on ideal family size. The
questions in the fertility surveys related to
personal expectations and intentions, plus
a question on the ideal family size for the
average American family.

Substantively, our analysis suggests
that there is no diminution over the time
period in the proportion of variance to be
explained by the social-demographic predictors considered. In fact, these variables
appear to increase in predictive power
over time. However, we must also emphasize that at no time do the variables explain more than a relatively smal: percentage of the variance in family-size
preferences—a high of 12 per cent in the
Gallup series in 1974 and 1977, and 16 per
cent (for family-size intentions) in the
1973 National Survey of Family Growth.
Clearly, if one wishes to think in terms of
explained variance, one needs to search
for additional predictors. In fact, when we
turn to the marginal importance of our

 

Social Biology

predictors, we see that most of the variance explained is due to age, race, religious affiliation, and education. Income—
husband’s or family—makes little or no
contribution once causally prior predictors are taken into account. Some predictors have clearly changed in importance
over time. Religious affiliation and community size have declined in importance,
and race (at least in the Gallup surveys)
has increased. Educational level has maintained a major position throughout.

Finally, a methodological finding: The
differentials in reproductive preferences
studied are highly congruent between the
two kinds of data sets—the Gallup surveys
and the national fertility studies. In effect,
the Gallup series on ideal family size produces a picture concerning socialdemographic differentials that is very
similar to the one depicted by expected/
intended (as well as ideal) family size in
the fertility surveys. Moreover, a comparison of the computations for ideal and
expected/intended family size in the fertility studies also indicates internal congruence. We believe it is significant that
diverse questions on reproductive preferences from disparate studies will produce
findings that are so similar.
