Reexamination of Interpregnancy Intervals and
Subsequent Birth Outcomes: Evidence from
U.S. Linked Birth/Infant Death Records

ABSTRACT: This study examines the net effects of the interpregnancy interval (time period from
one birth to the next pregnancy) on the risks of preterm birth, intrauterine growth retardation,
and infant mortality, for blacks and whites separately, using data from 1991 U.S. Linked
Birth—Infant Death files. Results show that short (less than 7 months) and long (61+ months) intervals between pregnancies raise the risk of preterm birth and intrauterine growth retardation
for both race groups, though the increase in risk is generally less than 30 per cent. Short intervals
also raise (slightly) the risk of infant mortality after controlling for birthweight and gestational

age.

A short interval between pregnancies
(interpregnancy interval, or IPI) is associated with an increased risk of low birthweight of the subsequent (index) birth in
several studies that have looked at this
question. Studies that have looked at the
association of short IPI with the components of low birthweight—preterm birth
and/or intrauterine growth retardation—
usually find that a short IPI raises the risk
of intrauterine growth retardation, though
results have been less consistent for
preterm birth (Ferraz 1988; Kallan 1992;
Lang et al. 1990; Lieberman 1989;
Mavalankar 1992; Miller 1991; Rawlings
et al. 1995).! Preterm births, in general

'Preterm is usually defined as less than 37 weeks gestation (although sometimes with the added condition of
less than 2500 grams at birth). TUGR is usually defined as
below the tenth percentile of birthweight for a given gestational age at birth based on a standard distribution (though
sometimes a proxy measure is used: less than 2500 grams
but 37 or more weeks gestation). The previously cited
studies vary in their definitions of PRETERM and IUGR.
Regarding PRETERM, some used “preterm low birthweight” (i.e., less than 37 weeks and less than 2500g) as
the dependent variable, while others (including the present

remain largely unexplained (Kiely and
Susser, 1992), though the rate of preterm
birth among blacks has been increasing,
with a corresponding increase in the
black/white gap in infant mortality (Singh
and Yu, 1995).

The main objective of this paper is
to examine the effects of IPI (both short
and long) on the risks of preterm birth
(PRETERM), intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and infant mortality, for
blacks and whites separately. In the one
previous study of black/white differences
in the effects of IPI, Rawlings et al.
(1995) concluded that “Among the black
women in our study population, intervals
of less than nine months between consecutive pregnancies were strongly associated with a higher prevalence of preterm

one) used “Jess than 37 weeks” without regard to birthweight. No relationship seems to exist between the definition of PRETERM used in these studies and their detection of an IPI effect; but there are numerous differences
across studies with respect to population under study, control of confounding variables, etc., that make comparisons
difficult.

delivery and low birthweight; this association largely accounts for the greater frequency of these outcomes among black
infants” (p.73). The above study was
based on a small sample of U.S. military
personnel and their dependents, a group
whose “demographic differences are
greatly attenuated” and whose members
had free access to quality health care. It
would be useful to examine the effects of
IPI on a few different adverse outcomes,
by race, using a larger, more representative U.S. dataset. I also explore the extent
to which IPI can account statistically for
the black/white gap in birth outcomes,
given the conclusion of Rawlings et al.,
whose stepwise regression analysis did
not directly address that question (nor has
it been addressed in prior research).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The analysis is based on data from the
1991 U.S. Linked Birth—-Infant Death
files from the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS). Overall, 97.7 per cent
of the birth and death records were
successfully linked by NCHS, though
this per cent varies by state. I use the
“denominator-plus file” of the linked
dataset, which is essentially the live-birth
file for 1991 with infant death data attached. I use births for all U.S. states (and
D.C.) for which data were collected on
the variables of interest. Four states did
not collect data on smoking (CA, NY, IN,
SD); one state (WA) did not collect data
on mother’s education. My analysis file is
limited to singleton births of parity two or
higher, born to black and white (non-Hispanic) women ages 18 and over. I further
selected births of gestational age 22 to 44
weeks in order to use Brenner’s definition
of IUGR (Brenner et al., 1976) and be

cause gestational data within this range
are more likely to be of higher quality
(Alexander et al., 1990). The minimum
age was set at 18 to help minimize the
truncation of the education variable’s distribution. After exclusion of cases with
missing data, the analysis file consists of
1,045,393 births (201,907 black; 843,486
white).

In the initial dataset 1.2 per cent of the
cases were of unknown race/ethnicity,
and 0.5 per cent were missing data on
parity. In the further-selected dataset of
non-Hispanic black and white singleton
births of parity two and higher, 16.9 per
cent of blacks and 11.5 per cent of whites
had imputed or missing gestational age
data; these cases were excluded. The percentage of missing data for other variables was low and was similar for blacks
and whites.

PRETERM is defined as gestational
age of less than 37 weeks. Gestational
age is based primarily on the mother’s
report of last normal menstrual period
(LNMP). A clinical estimate is used
when the mother’s report 1s missing (relatively few cases). IUGR is based on
Brenner’s definition and standard distribution: below the 10th percentile of birthweight for a given gestational age. Infant
mortality 1s defined as death within one
year of birth.

While gestational age measurement on
birth-certificate records has improved in
recent years (especially beginning with
1989 data), measurement error no doubt
exists, and its extent may vary by state,
by sociodemographic subgroup, and by
outcome (Alexander et al., 1995; Kirby,
1995). Moreover, clinical estimates do
not always agree with LNMP-based (selfreport) estimates, though the relative validity of the two measures is unknown

(Alexander et al,, 1995). As a sensitivity
test, I re-ran all analyses after excluding
(the relatively few) cases where clinical
estimates of gestation were used (Alexander et al., 1995); there was very little
change in parameter estimates. As mentioned, I excluded very short and very
long gestations to try to maximize the
quality of the gestational age data used in
this analysis.

Interpregnancy interval (IPI) is defined
as the interval between the previous livebirth date and the current pregnancy (conception) date, in months. This figure was
derived by converting the variable BIRTH
INTERVAL from months (as measured
on the birth certificate) to weeks and
subtracting gestational age (in weeks)
from it. I grouped IPI into 8 categories:
<7 months, 7-12, 13-18, 19-24, 2536, 37-48, 49-60, 61+ months. Seven
dummy variables are used in multivariate
analysis, with 25-36 as the reference category. Fetal loss occurring with the IPI
cannot be measured with these data.

Sociodemographic variables, referring
to the mother, consist of black/white race,
age, education, and marital status. Other
independent variables, which I refer to
as the “health/pregnancy variables” (and
treated as a set in multivariate analysis)
include: parity, chronic hypertension,
pregnancy-induced hypertension, weight
gain during pregnancy, smoking during
pregnancy, and adequacy of prenatal care
(a modified Kessner index constructed by
NCHS and based on number and timing
of visits by gestational age).

In the multivariate analysis, I assume
that the sociodemographic variables as a
set are causally and temporally antecedent to the health/pregnancy variables
as a set (within each set, no assumptions
are made about causal ordering of the

Birth Spacing

variables). IPI, however, is the one independent variable whose causal/temporal
placement is ambiguous with respect to
the other two sets of independent variables. My selection of regression models,
and the order in which I run them, reflect
these assumptions and ambiguities.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for
the study population. Blacks are twice as
likely as whites to have short IPI’s (7 or
less months), but are fairly similar to
whites in the frequency of most IPI categories beyond 7 months. The other variables show levels that are consistent with
other research, with the exception of
“previous PRETERM or IUGR birth,”
where rates and race differences are suspiciously low. Due to the questionable reliability of this variable, it is not used in
multivariate analysis.”

A series of logistic regression models
is used to estimate the effects of IPI on
birth outcomes by race. In Tables 2 and 3,
for blacks and whites separately, IPI effects are estimated with no controls

*When the variable was included in multivariate
models, it did not change the results in any way, but the
variable did have a strong “effect” on PRETERM and
IUGR of the index birth. It should also be recognized
that the data do not allow separate analysis of cases
whose previous pregnancy ended in live birth versus
those ending in fetal loss, or inclusion in the mode] of a
variable indicating the prior pregnancy’s live/loss status. Other data suggest that the adverse effects of short
IPI are greater when the prior pregnancy ended in a live
birth, where IPI is defined as the interval between the
last pregnancy’s termination (regardless of live/loss
outcome) and the current pregnancy (Kallan, 1992). It
is possible that the adverse effects of short IPI would be
stronger if the analysis were limited to cases where the
previous pregnancy ended in a live birth.

in this way yields a range of IPI’s “effects” (gross to net), which is useful
given the ambiguous causal ordering of
IPI with respect to the other independent
variables, as discussed earlier.

According to these tables, the effects
of short IPI (less than 7 months) on both
PRETERM and IUGR are generally similar for blacks and whites, especially in
terms of net effects (compare Model 3 of
both tables). Short IPI for blacks shows
an odds ratio (OR) of 1.25 for PRETERM
(relative to 25-36 months), while for
whites the figure is 1.23. For blacks,
short IPI shows an OR of 1.24 for IUGR
(relative to 25-36 months), while for
whites the figure is 1.16. (These race dif
ferences are not significant at p < 0.05,
based on interaction tests in combinedrace models.) For all race groups and
outcomes, as IPI gets longer the risk decreases and then rises at the longer IPI’s,
especially in the case of IUGR. Long IPI
(61+ months) actually has stronger adverse “effects” for whites than for blacks.
For blacks, long IPI shows an OR for
PRETERM of 1.07, while for whites the
OR is 1.26. For blacks, long IPI shows
an OR for IUGR of 1.14, while for
whites the figure is 1.31. (These differences are significant at p < 0.05.) Thus,
the effects of IPI on both outcomes are
generally more U-shaped among whites
than among blacks.

Additional patterns worth noting include the larger gross effects of IPI (short
and long) on both outcomes for whites
relative to blacks (Model 1 of both tables), mainly because IPI has a stronger
association with the sociodemographic
variables among whites. Secondly, IPI
odds ratios are not affected by the exclusion or inclusion of the weight gain variable (for either race group or outcome).

Table 4 shows the effects of IPI on infant mortality after controlling for all previous independent variables as well as for
gestation and birthweight. The models
show a small but significant net effect of
short IPI for both blacks and whites, and
no effect of long IPI. While birthweight

and gestational age do not explain all of
the effect of short IPI on infant mortality
in these models, the effects of short and
long IPI on infant mortality are considerably larger before controlling for birthweight and gestational age (not shown).

To summarize, the net effects of short
IPI on PRETERM, IUGR, and infant
mortality are similar for blacks and
whites in this analysis, while long IPI
shows stronger net effects for whites. The
net effects of IPI (short or long) on all
Outcomes are generally small for both
race groups.

conclusion that short IPI plays a role in
accounting for the poorer birth outcomes

among blacks relative to whites, I ran an
additional series of regression models to
explore this question. My results indicate
that IPI explains little, if any, of the
black/white gap in PRETERM and IUGR
in the general population, which is not
surprising given the results presented thus
far. The methodology is briefly described
below.

I estimated a series of six logistic regression models for PRETERM and six for
IUGR. Because of the ambiguous causal
order of IPI in relation to the other sets
> of independent variables (“sociodemos graphic” and “health/pregnancy” sets), I
8 started with three models which do not
g include IPI at all: one containing only
2 race, yielding baseline bivariate odds ratios;
A a second one which adds the other sociodemographic variables (age, education, marital status) to the first; and a third, which
adds the health/pregnancy variables (but not
IPI) to the previous model. In three additional models, IPI was added to each of the
above three models, giving some idea of the
extent to which IPI explains the race gap in
outcomes over and above the other sets of
variables. I found that adding IPI to each of
the 3 models hardly reduced the race gap

13:47 08 December 2015

y [University of Michigan] at

(odds ratio) in outcomes in any model
(though IPI did significantly improve the
model fits). The race odds ratio for
PRETERM was always more than 2.0.
Moreover, the race odds ratios (main effects) barely changed when the interaction
terms (race X IPI) were added to the equations, reinforcing the conclusion that IPI accounts for little if any of the black/white
gap in PRETERM and IUGR in the general population. It’s worth mentioning
that the largest reductions in the race
odds ratios resulted from the addition of
the sociodemographic variables (the second model described above), though only
about one-half of the race difference in
IUGR, and substantially less than that in
the case of PRETERM, could be accounted for by these sociodemographic
variables.

DISCUSSION

The net effects of IPI on PRETERM,
IUGR, and infant mortality in this analysis are generally similar in size for blacks
and whites, according to this analysis of
vital statistics data for the U.S. general
population. In one previous study of race

differences in the prevalence and effects
of IPI, Rawlings et al. (1995) reported
stronger adverse effects of short IPI on
PRETERM for blacks than for whites in
a select population of military personnel.
(They did not look at the effects of long
IPI, or infant mortality as an outcome).
Short IPI, although displaying fairly
weak net effects in this study, is nevertheless a risk factor that should be taken into
account in preventive health programs.
Most explanations for the effects of short
IPI involve depletion of maternal nutritional resources (Winkvist et al., 1992).
Reducing the prevalence of short IPI,
however, would probably not have much
impact on black/white differentials in
birth outcomes according to this analysis.

Social Biology

Research on the causes of race/ethnic differences in birth outcomes should continue to focus on linkages between socioeconomic, institutional, behavioral, health
care, and medical risk factors.

Long IPI (greater than 60 months) was
also associated with adverse birth outcomes in this analysis, consistent with the
findings of other studies that have looked
at long IPI (Kallan, 1992; Lieberman et
al., 1989; Mavalankar et al., 1992). The
associations may reflect, in part, impaired
fecundity as well as fetal loss intervening
between the previous live birth and the
current index birth. Intervening fetal loss.
might increase the length of the interpregnancy interval as well as raise the
risk of an adverse outcome.
