-© ABSTRACT: Data were taken from the 1994 National Opinion Research Center survey of a repre5 sentative sample of American adults to examine the relation between the intelligence of adults

© aged 40+ and their numbers of children and their numbers of siblings. The correlations were

5p found to be significantly negative at —0.05 and —0.09, respectively, indicating the presence of
S dysgenic fertility. Further analysis showed that dysgenic fertility is present only in females. The
& correlation for females between intelligence and ideal numbers of children was effectively zero,
cc indicating that if women had the numbers of children they consider ideal, dysgenic fertility

~ would be reduced.
g
2 There has been a long standing con
‘9 cern that the intelligence of modern populations may be deteriorating as a result
of the tendency of the more intelligent to
“g have fewer children than the less intelli0 Sgent. This phenomenon has become
‘= known as dysgenic fertility or dysgenics.
> Anxiety about the probable existence of
5 dysgenic fertility was voiced in the nineteenth century by Galton (1869) and in
& the twentieth century by numerous bioF logical and social scientists including
A Fisher (1929), Cattell (1937), and Muller
(1963).

The theory and evidence for the existence of dysgenic fertility have recently
been reviewed by Lynn (1996). There are
four types of evidence pointing to the
presence of dysgenic fertility throughout
the twentieth century in the economically
developed nations. These are, firstly, the
extensive evidence for a negative association between intelligence and numbers of
siblings, suggesting that more intelligent

sity of Mi

individuals have fewer children; secondly, the extensive evidence for a negative association between educational
level, taken as a proxy for intelligence,
and numbers of children; thirdly, the extensive evidence for a negative association between socioeconomic status, taken
as another proxy for intelligence, and
numbers of children; and fourthly, the
less extensive evidence for a negative association between the intelligence of
adults and their numbers of children.

Of these four classes of evidence, the
last must be considered the most direct
and persuasive, because the first three are
less direct, subject to error, and open to
other explanations. However, the last is
also the class of evidence for which comparatively little data exist and for which
such data as do exist are contradictory. Despite the long-standing concern over the
probable existence of dysgenic fertility, it
was not until the 1960’s that direct evidence on the relationship between the in
146

 
 

Vol. 46, No. 1~2

telligence of adults and their numbers of
children began to be published. Most of
these studies were carried out in the
United States. The first were by Higgins et
al., (1962) and Bajema (1963) and found
that the relationship between intelligence
and numbers of children was slightly positive and therefore that fertility was not
dysgenic. However, neither of these studles was based on representative samples of
=the population which is an important re“\quirement for studies of this issue. In the
51980’s and 1990’s four studies based on
omore representative samples of the AmeriAcan population found that fertility was
codysgenic (Vining, 1982, 1995; Van Court
ccand Bean, 1985; Retherford and Sewell,
61988; Hermstein and Murray, 1994).
~ Only the third of these studies prer=sented an estimate of the magnitude of
Sithe deterioration of intelligence arising
‘Sfrom the negative association between inStelligence and fertility. Retherford and
‘SSewell estimated the difference between
“=the parental and child generations in their
osample at 0.81 IQ points. This difference
‘Sis known as the selection differential and
— represents what may be called the ‘
Stional” decline of intelligence, that is, the
‘Sdecline which would be present if envi‘Sronmental influences on intelligence were
‘the same for the parental and child generSations. It may be useful to note that the
Retherford and Sewell sample population
(1) was born about the year 1940; (2)
consisted almost entirely of whites, so
was not representative of the American
population; (3) did not include highschool drop-outs; and (4) was age 35
when the fertility of the sample was
recorded, so that fertility was not yet
complete. For these reasons it was not a
perfect sample for a study of the presence
and magnitude of dysgenic fertility. Nev
 

Brief Reports 147

ertheless, the authors made reasonable
adjustments for these shortcomings of
their sample.

There have been two recent contributions
to the debate on whether dysgenic fertility
is present in the United States. Williams
and Ceci (1997) present data showing that
black-white and socioeconomic-status differences in intelligence have narrowed
over the past few decades. They argue
that if dysgenic fertility had been present,
the differences should have widened.
This argument is not a valid one for the
reasons given by Loehlin (1997). The fallacy in the argument is that environmental effects have acted more powerfully to
raise the IQ’s of lower IQ groups which
has masked the less powerful genetic effects caused by dysgenic fertility. As
Loehlin (1997, p. 1237) correctly observes in a commentary on their paper,
their data “have little or no bearing on the
hypothesis of dysgenesis.”

Loehlin presents data which do have a
bearing on the issue of dysgenic fertility,
that is, the fertility of American women
aged 35-44 in 1992 in relation to their
educational level. The relationship is negative. Loehlin assigns IQ’s to six educational levels and estimates the IQ of the
child generation at 0.80 IQ points lower
than that of their mothers in the case of
whites and 0.75 IQ points lower in the
case of blacks.

It should be noted that dysgenics (the
genotypic deterioration of the population)
is not only caused by a negative association between intelligence and numbers of
children but can also be caused by generation length. If there is a tendency for the
less intelligent to have children at a
younger age than the more intelligent,
then the numbers of less intelligent individuals in the population will increase
148

even in the absence of any association between intelligence and completed fertility.
A useful discussion of this issue and the
formula for calculating the effect of generation length is given by Cavalli-Sforza and
Bodmer (1971, p. 297, Equation 6.5). The
magnitude of dysgenics is determined by
what is known as the “intrinsic rate of increase” of people with low intelligence as
a compared with people of high intelligence.
= This rate of increase is determined by two
factors: (1) the association between intelli5 gence and numbers of children; and (2) the
© association between intelligence and gen4 eration length. The second of these factors
co has been discussed and some evidence for
ccits existence adduced by Hermstein and
co Murray (1994), but apart from this source
+ it has received little empirical attention. It
‘gis nevertheless important to note its exisobtence as a component of dysgenics.
In this paper I present new data on the
a relationship between intelligence and fer© tility for a more representative sample of
+= American adults and for an age at which
© fertility is virtually complete.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data for this study are for the United
States and are drawn from the General So5 cial Survey for 1994 carried out by the Na4 tional Opinion Research Center (NORC). A
description of the sampling and other particulars of the survey are given by Davis
and Smith (1996). The sample consisted of
2,992 English-speaking individuals aged 18
years and older selected as a national probability sample from continental United
States, but excluding individuals resident in
institutions.

The NORC surveys are carried out
each year and obtain a large amount of
information from the respondents. These

Social Biology

surveys consist of a number of core questions which are asked every year, and a
number of additional questions which are
asked in some years but not in others.
The 1994 survey is particularly useful for
our present purpose because the questions include a verbal reasoning intelligence test and ask respondents for their
numbers of children, their ideal numbers
of children, and their numbers of siblings.
From these questions it is possible to examine the relationship between intelligence and numbers of children, and
hence whether fertility was eugenic or
dysgenic. The relationships between intelligence and ideal numbers of children
and numbers of siblings provide additional interesting information.

The verbal reasoning test consists of 8
similarity questions. The first is “In what
way are an orange and a banana alike?”
The questions become progressively more
difficult, and the last one is “In what way
are praise and punishment alike?” The responses are scored as correct, partly correct,
incorrect, and don’t know. In order to derive
a verbal reasoning score, I have awarded 2
points for each correct answer, 1 point for
each partly correct answer, and zero points
for incorrect and don’t-know answers.
Thus, there is a maximum possible score of
16 and a minimum of 0. The numbers of
children recorded in the survey are the
numbers alive at the time of the interview.
This figure is the most useful for our present purposes, because children who die in
childhood are of little or no interest from a
eugenic viewpoint.

RESULTS

For a consideration of the problem of
whether the fertility of a population is eugenic or dysgenic in respect to intelli
 
Vol. 46, No. 1-2

gence, it is important to examine completed fertility. The reason is that the
more intelligent tend to have their children later than the less intelligent. Thus,
among a population in their twenties
there might be an inverse or dysgenic relationship between intelligence and fertility because the more intelligent tend to
delay their childbearing, but this inverse
_felationship might diminish or even reoverse among the same sample in their
thirties or forties. For this reason, the relationship between intelligence and fertilty in samples below the age of 40 cannot
Aprovide a definitive answer to the probjem of whether fertility is dysgenic.
Hence, my first step was to discard the recospondents aged 18-39 and to consider
only those aged 40 and above. The 40ear-olds in the sample were born in
FAI54, and the sample of 40+-year-olds
.2can be considered as approximately the
21930-54 birth cohort. The choice of the
Sage of 40 is arbitrary and is based on the
“yassumption that by this age fertility is virStually complete. This restriction of the
‘sample to those aged 40 and above re[duces the sample size to 1,645.
s The most straightforward way to examine the data to determine whether ferStility is eugenic or dysgenic is to compute
Scorrelations between intelligence and
Gnumbers of children. These correlations
can be calculated for the total sample and
for subsamples of males and females and
blacks and whites. These correlations are
shown in Table 1. Reading down the
lines, we see that the salient points in this
table are as follows. The first line gives
the data for the total population. The correlation between intelligence and number
of children is —0.05 and is therefore dysgenic. The correlation between intelligence and ideal number of children is

 

Brief Reports

149

—0.04. Notice, however, that this correlation is based on substantially fewer re~spondents because only 59 per cent of the
sample gave an answer to this question
which could produce a distorted result.
The correlation between intelligence and
numbers of siblings is also negative at
~—0.09. This finding suggests that fertility
was dysgenic for intelligence in the
parental generation of the sample, as explained in the discussion section of this
paper.

The remainder of Table 1 shows the
correlations for a number of subsamples.
Line 2 gives the correlations for all
males; Line 3, for all females. Notice that
it is female fertility that is dysgenic
(—0.09) while male fertility is neutral
(—0.01). Female ideal fertility is not dysgenic (—0.01), suggesting that if females
had the numbers of children they considered ideal, dysgenic fertility would be reduced.

Lines 4, 5, and 6 give the data for whites
for both sexes combined and for males and
females. As whites make up the great majority of the total sample, the results are
closely similar to those of the total sample.
Lines 7, 8, and 9 give the data for blacks for
both sexes combined and for males and females separately. Among blacks, fertility is
slightly but not significantly eugenic. This
finding is contrary to the results obtained by
Hermstein and Murray (1994) and Vining
(1995), who found fertility more dysgenic
among blacks. However, the number of
blacks in our sample is only 191, and it is
doubtful that any significance can be attached to this result. It may be noted that
the numbers of blacks and whites are fewer
than the number of the total sample. The
explanation is that the total sample contained 46 respondents classified as “other”
than black or white.

We now look at the distribution of inS telligence and the mean numbers of children at different intelligence levels. For
“ this purpose, the sample was divided into
3 eight intelligence bands based on vocabu‘S lary scores 0-2, 3-4, 5-6, etc., and the
= mean numbers of children of males and
= females was calculated for each band.
__ The results are shown in Table 2. The inS terest of this table is that Higgins, et al.
Z (1962) proposed that those with very low
S1Q’s had very few children, which ex‘5 plained why there were negative correla‘>,tions between intelligence and numbers
= of siblings but a positive correlation, in
3 their sample, between intelligence and
< number of children. Individuals with no
= children are not represented in the sibling
A studies. However, we see in Table 2 that
there is no tendency for those with very
low IQ’s to have few children. On the
contrary, those in the low IQ bands have
more children than those in the higher IQ
bands.

We now consider ideal numbers of
children in relation to the same intelligence bands. The data are shown in Table
3. If ideal numbers of children are compared with actual numbers of children in
the different intelligence bands given in

 

No. Child. No. Sibs No. No. Ideal

~I1¢ —09° 507 00

05 —02 101 —14
03 03 32 -17
06 —06 64 -11

Table 2, we see that, among women, the
three lowest IQ bands have more children
than they regard as ideal, while the four
highest intelligence bands have fewer
children than they consider ideal.

We turn now to the magnitude of the
decline of intelligence implied by the
significant negative correlation between
the intelligence of adults aged 40+ and
their numbers of children. If intelligence has some heritability, the result
will be that the “genotypic intelligence”
of the child generation will be lower
than the “genotypic intelligence” of the
parental generation. The term “genotypic intelligence” means the genetic
component of intelligence. To estimate
the magnitude of the decline of genotypic intelligence, we adopt the method
of Retherford and Sewell (1988). First,
we calculate the mean IQ of the sample
and obtain a figure of 9.25, s.d. = 3.22.
Second, we estimate the mean IQ of the
children of the sample by assuming that
children have the same IQ’s as their
parents, which gives a figure of 9.12.
The difference between the two scores
is 0.13 and is the selection differential.
As explained in the introduction, this
figure is the notional decline of intelli

The selection differential can be expressed in conventional IQ terms by calculating it in s.d. units. It amounts to
0.04 s.d. units which is the equivalent of
0.60 [Q points. The genotypic decline is
obtained by multiplying the selection
differential by the heritability of intelligence. If a heritability of 0.80 is assumed, as argued by Lynn (1996), the
genotypic decline is 0.48 IQ points for
this generation. Those preferring alternative figures for heritability can make
their own calculations.

gence, i.e., the decline which would be DISCUSSION
present if environmental influences
were constant for the two generations. The results contain six principal points

of interest. First, they confirm previous
studies summarized in the introduction
that fertility was dysgenic for American
birth cohorts born in the middle decades
of the twentieth century. Second, the present data should be regarded as the most
satisfactory hitherto adduced for an examination of the presence of dysgenic
fertility, in so far as they comprise a sample representative of continental United
States with completed fertility. Third, the
magnitude of the selection differential in
the present study of 0.60 IQ points is
152

similar to the figure of 0.81 obtained by
Retherford and Sewell (1988) and of 0.80
by Loehlin (1997), showing a satisfactory
degree of consistency among the three
studies. Fourth, dysgenic fertility was
found to be present in females but not in
males, confirming the results of Retherford and Sewell and of Vining.

Fifth, the data for ideal numbers of
children considered in relation to actual
cnumbers of children (shown in Table 2)
“throw some light on the reasons for dys
enic fertility. Looking at the females, we
%ee that women in the four lowest IQ
Chands have more children than they conSider ideal. Possibly the explanation lies
on contraceptive failures which are likely
cto be more frequent among the less inteldigent. On the other hand, women in the
‘dour highest IQ bands have fewer chilaren than they consider ideal. Possibly
.ahe explanation for this is that some more
Antelligent women delay their childbearSing until too late to have as many chil‘aren as they desire, either because of the
Dnset of infertility or because they have
Mifficulty in finding satisfactory marriage
artners. We see from Table 1 that if
“women had the number of children they
-onsider ideal, there would be a reduction
an dysgenic fertility (r = —0.01).
= Six, the negative correlations between
AlQ’s and numbers of siblings, shown in
Table 1, confirm the results of numerous
‘other studies summarized in Lynn (1966).
They should be interpreted as measures of
dysgenic fertility in the parental generation of the sample, i.e., in the birth cohort
born around 1900-30. The explanation 1s
that a negative correlation between intelli
 

Brief Reports

Social Biology

gence and numbers of children produces a
negative correlation between intelligence
and numbers of siblings in the child generation, as explained in the classical analyses of this phenomenon by Cattell (1937)
and others. Thus, the data presented in this
paper indicate the existence of dysgenic
fertility for the first two American generations of the twentieth century.

Finally, it should be noted that the
magnitudes of dysgenic fertility estimated from this data set and from those
of Retherford and Sewell (1988) and
Loehlin (1997) do not take account of
generation length. As noted in the introduction, if the less intelligent have a
shorter generation length than the more
intelligent, 1.e., tend to have their children
at younger ages, the effect is dysgenic because the numbers of the less intelligent
increase more rapidly in the population.
Some evidence that this 1s the case is provided by Herrnstein and Murray (1994, p.
351-352) who show that in the National
Longitudinal Study of Youth data set
women in the highest cognitive ability
group had their first child at an average
age of 27.2 years and that age at first
birth declined progressively through five
cognitive groups to an average age of
19.8 among the lowest cognitive ability
group. The data set analyzed in this paper
do not contain information on the ages at
which women had their children, and it is
not possible to estimate the dysgenic impact of this factor. However, it should be
noted that because generation length is
not entered in the analysis, the calculation of the magnitude of dysgenics is almost certainly an underestimate.
