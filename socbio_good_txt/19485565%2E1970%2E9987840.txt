Phenotypic Assortative Mating among the

Peruvian Cashinahua

Among human populations, the selection
of a spouse is conditioned by many factors
involving not only natural but cultural
determinants. The social regulation of marriage, common to all human societies, narrows the range of potential spouses in a way
which interferes with random mating. At the
genotypic level, this nonrandomness is referred to as inbreeding (Li, 1961; Wallace,
1968) and is a function of the frequency of
consanguineous marriages. At the phenotypic level, nonrandom mating is referred to as
assortative mating (Falconer, 1961; Wallace, 1968) and is usually ascribed to the
exercise of ‘“‘choice’’ in spouse selection,
though genetic relationships may be a factor
as well (Crow and Felsenstein, 1968).

Many studies have detected significant
amounts of phenotypic assortative mating
for traits such as education, intelligence,
religion (Burgess and Wallin, 1943; Garrison, Anderson, and Reed, 1968), many of
which have no heritability at all. However,
other authors have detected assortative
mating for physical characteristics, most
notably height and weight (see summary
article by Spuhler, 1968). These associations, measured by the magnitude of the
coefficient of correlations between spouses,

 

have been low positive and led Spuhler to
conclude that “‘the degree of assortative
mating experienced in contemporary European peoples probably has a small influence
on the population distribution of inherited
physical characteristics” (p. 139).

In his comprehensive survey, Spuhler,
however, found only two non-European
populations sampled, the Ramah Navaho
and the Japanese. Neither sample yielded
significant associations for height or weight.
However, neither of these groups represents
small, isolated, primitive populations. In
such small populations, interruptions in
random mating could have a more profound
effect on the distribution of genotypes and
permit greater changes in gene frequency
through the action of selection, drift, or differential migration. For this reason, I have
undertaken an analysis of phenotypic assortative mating among Just such a population, the Cashinahua Indians of the Peruvian rain forest.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The Peruvian Cashinahua are a small
unacculturated tribal isolate who live along
the Curanja River, a tributary of the Purus,
in northeastern Peru, a few miles from the

three neighboring, but endogamous, villages
They have been described demographically
and genetically in previous publications
(Johnston et al., 1968; 1969a; 1969); Jantz
et al., 1969) emanating from our 1966
studies, and repetition is not necessary. It
should be noted, however, that, due to
small population size, village endogamy, and

polygyny, considerable pressure is exerted
upon both men and women to marry. Almost all women are married before puberty;
our census showed no females unmarried
who were over 14 years of age, while only 4
of 12 males between 15 and 19 were single
and none beyond 19.

A single observer measured all inhabitants of the three villages, except for the
infants. Since our demographic data indicated that, in the population, there were 42
females who were or had been the first
wives of 42 male villagers, this made possible
the study of assortative mating within these
pairs. The degree of phenotypic association
between men and their first wives was determined by the product-moment 7, calculated for the following variables:

1. Age, as estimated from detailed ethnographic records, to the nearest year.

Social Biology

2. Stature (in centimeters).

3. Weight (in kilograms). As there were four
females among the 42 who were pregnant,
sample size was reduced to 38 for this
dimension.

4, Bi-epicondylar diameter of the humerus
(in mm.). This variable was selected as one
measurement highly unlikely to show any
assortative mating.

5. Body fat, as estimated from the sum of the
triceps and subscapular skinfolds. Since
measures of body fat are highly skewed,
normalized values obtained by a logarithmic transformation (Edwards, 1955)
were utilized.

In addition, to provide an additional control, the males were paired at random with
females of the sample; stature within these
random pairs was correlated.

Assortative mating may be a consequence
of genetic relationship (Crow and Felsenstein, 1968), as well as the exercise of any
choice in mate selection. The small effective
population size (N, = 61; Johnston et al.,
1969b) and the estimated coefficients of
inbreeding (F = 0.024), when considered in
the light of the high rate (86%) of village
endogamy, made this a possible cause of any
detectable assortative mating. To control
this aspect, I investigated the existence of
any nonrandomness in mating types among
my sample at the haptoglobin lecus. The
distribution of the six possible mating types
was compared to that expected under conditions of random mating.

RESULTS

Table 1 shows the comparisons of observed and expected distributions of mating
types at the haptoglobin locus. It can be
seen that the two distributions do not differ
significantly, as indicated by the x? of 1.226.

Table 2 presents the correlations obtained for the above-mentioned variables.
It can be seen that the highest coefficient is
for the association between the age of aman
and his first wife (r = 0.759). This is not
unexpected and falls within the range reported by Spuhler (1968) for 14 samples,
though considerably below the value of 0.99

which he found among the Ramah Navaho.

A positive correlation, significant at the
0.025 level, exists among the Cashinahua
for the stature of a man and his first wife
(r = 0.346). This becomes more notable
when compared to the random pairs correlation of —0.009.

Weight is positively correlated among the
husbands and wives of my sample at an r of
0.313, quite close to the values obtained for
stature. However, this is not simply a matter of body fat, since the correlation for fat,
as estimated by the sum of triceps and subscapular skinfolds, is not significantly different from zero (0.020).

might, in part, be affected by age. (Nine of
the females in the sample were less than 20
years of age.)

Table 3 presents the age-constant partial
correlations of husband/wife height and
husband/wife weight. Two partial correlations are given for each measurement, since
the results depend upon whether the wife or
the husband is used as the source of the dependent variable. Regardless of which
spouse is used, the within-measurement
partial correlations are similar; correlations
for height are likewise similar to those for
weight. In every case but one, removing the
effect of age reduces the initial values of r

The apparently simple relationship between a husband’s stature or weight and
that of his first wife is complicated by the
fact that both height and weight are positively correlated with age. This is particularly true in the Cashinahua, since marriages
occur at very early ages. Due to the delayed
rates of maturation noted among children of
this group (ms. in preparation) a significant
amount of growth in height and weight occurs after marriage. In view of the high association between husband and wife’s ages,
it seemed more than possible that the high
correlations obtained for stature and weight

to non-significant levels, although they approach the 0.05 level. Thus the 0.346, obtained for stature, is reduced to 0.296 and
0.239. The correlation for weight is reduced
from 0.313 to 0.245 when the husband’s age
is used; however, when the wife’s age is used,
the partial correlation is the same as the
original one, 0.313.

DISCUSSION

The mating systems of small, relatively
isolated populations differ from those of
large communities or nations with high
population densities. In many non-Western
societies such as the Cashinahua, the difference is further magnified by a marked
regulation of marriage along kinship lines.
The ideal marriage among the Cashinahua is

endogamous with respect to village, but
exogamous with respect to moiety. Also, a
man may not marry a woman one generation removed from his.

Although deviations from this “ideal”
do occur, they represent only about 17% of
90 recorded marriages (Johnston et al.,
1969). Even when tolerated, such unions are
looked upon with suspicion, and resulting
pregnancies may frequently be terminated
through the use of abortive drugs.

Social Biology

sortative mating for stature is not present.
The correlation of randomized pairs in the
sample, which would also remove the effects
of age (the total age range was from 12 to
50-++ years old), resulted in a correlation for
stature of —0.009. When compared to the
partial, age-constant correlations of 0.296
and 0.239, this suggests that some positive
assortative mating may exist.

The same holds true for weight. In fact,
if the age of the wife is used in computing

Thus, in such populations, deviations
from panmixia become more numerous and
potentially more important in leading to
evolutionary change. Phenotypic assortative mating, if present, can be a more important factor under these conditions than
in the large, modern groups usually sampled.

The detection of assortative mating for
stature and weight among the Peruvian
Cashinahua is complicated by the relationship of both variables to age. When the
effects of age are removed, of the four resulting partial r’s only the one for weight
remains significant. The others are reduced
to levels which, at best, are of borderline
significance.

This does not mean that positive as
 

the partial correlation, there is no reduction
in the presumably age-independent value of
0.313. This failure of the partial r to reduce
the original one is due to the fact that the
correlation of the weight of the husband and
the age of the wife is quite low (0.215). On
the other hand, the correlation of the age of
the husband and the weight of the wife is
considerably higher (0.454), due to the
greater tendency of females to become fatter
with age (ms. in preparation).

It is difficult from these data to determine
the nature of the age effect. It is possible
that the effect is merely a statistical one,
that is, that the average amount of size increase between adolescence, when marriages
occur, and the cessation of growth is such

Vol. 17, No. 1

that a false correlation between husband and
wife is bound to occur. On the other hand,
it Is possible that some positive assortative
mating exists even among adolescents. That
is, tall males in their teens tend to choose, as
wives, taller females; both husband and
wife will continue to grow.

The absence of any significant association
between the skinfold thicknesses of a man
and his first wife suggests that any whatever
assortative mating for stature exists is more
a function of general body size than the
amount of subcutaneous fat present.

The effects of assortative mating upon
the genetic structure and eventual evolutionary dynamics of the Cashinahua are, for
the above reasons, not completely clear.
Certainly the magnitude of the correlations
are all low and the explained variance is
quite small. On the other hand, if there is
assortative mating even among the very
young, fertility patterns may be affected.
The association between husbands and
wives in stature and weight and the association during adolescence of greater body size,
and early sexual maturation (Shuttleworth,
1939; Tanner, 1962) may mean that earlymaturing couples are tending to marry.
This could result in three or more years
being added to the fertile years of such
couples, thus potentially increasing the
average number of children produced by
them. In populations living in harsh environments with very high rates of infant
and childhood mortality (see Johnston et al.,
1969), this could have significant consequences. On the other hand, since marriages
occur at such early ages, even prepuberally
in the case of females, it is possible that
differential fertility may not be a factor.

Assortative mating for stature may be a
consequence of social status, since marriages
are determined not only by kinship, but also
by economic and political factors as well.
Since such status is usually associated with
larger body size, this may explain the low
positive correlation between spouses. In a
small population, such a relationship would
have a greater effect than in a larger one
causing significant deviations from the expectations where mating is random with
respect to phenotype.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Among 42 husband~first-wife pairs of
Peruvian Cashinahua Indians, phenotypic
assortative mating exists only for stature
and weight, not for body fat or less visible
anthropometric dimensions. When the effects of age on height and weight are removed however, husband/wife correlations
tend to be reduced to non-significant levels,
although some assortative mating seems to
remain. If there is a positive association,
this might permit certain mating combinations (tall tall; heavy X heavy) to utilize
longer periods of fertility in view of the very
early ages of marriages among this group.
This association for body size may reflect
the relationship among social status, body
size, and spouse selection, and their greater
effects in small populations.
