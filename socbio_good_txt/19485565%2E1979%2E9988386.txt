ABSTRACT: Periodic regression analysis was applied to data from Fulton County, Georgia, 196777, to test for a relationship between social status and season of birth in two population groups,
whites and all other races. Results suggest that for both groups seasonal variation in births tends to
increase with lower social status. Proportionately more births to lower status women, especially in
the all-other-races group, occured during August. Due to timing of birth, these children have a
young age at entry into school which has been shown to result in poor early academic performance.

The seasonal cycle of births in the
United States has been described as a bimodal pattern with a minor peak in January-February and a major peak in AugustSeptember (Rosenberg, 1966). However,
there is little information on the timing of
births and social status. In other words, is
the seasonal variation in births related to
social status?

The answer to this question is important because Warren (1978, ms.) has
shown from national survey data that
children born during the major peak
(August-September) have poor early academic performance relative to children
born in other months because of a younger
age at entry into school. Becoming aware
of the potential negative effects of births in
these months would be especially important for members of any social status
group with a pronounced AugustSeptember peak in births.

The study reported here expands infor
mation from previous research (Pasamanick et al., 1960; Zeinik, 1969; Chaudhury, 1972) on an association between
social status and season of birth in three
ways:

1. Season of birth patterns are analyzed
for social status classifications within racial
groups.

2. The time period is a continuous eleven
year period, 1967-77.

3. The statistical technique used (periodic regression analysis) allows for
significance testing of the seasonal pattern
and testing for changes in the pattern over
time (peak or trough shifts).

PREVIOUS RESEARCH

SEASON OF BIRTH AND SOCIAL STATUS:
THE BALTIMORE STUDIES

Using data from Baltimore, Maryland,
1952-56, Pasamanick et al. (1960) examined the relationship between seasonal
variation in births and socioeconomic sta

tus. They determined socioeconomic status of the mother by census tract of residence, with median rent or value of the
dwelling property being the determinant
of the status category. Five status categories were identified for whites; all other
races were treated as a single group. A
monthly percentage index of births was
used, with the average monthly percentage being 8.3 per cent. The authors concluded (p. 253), ‘‘The lower the socloeconomic group, the more closely its
vital statistics tend to conform to the
general pattern of the spring trough. The
higher the socioeconomic group, the less
the departure from the normal expectancy
of 8.3%.”

In attempting to account for the
seasonal differences, Pasamanick and his
colleagues suggested that climate, nutritional practices, and family planning action are affected by socioeconomic status
and may create differing seasonal fertility
patterns. Members of upper socioeconomic groups modify environmental
heat stress by living in air-conditioned
houses, minimize dietary deficiencies by
practicing better nutritional habits than
those of members of lower status groups,
and tend more frequently than members
of lower status groups to use birth control
devices.

Zelnik (1969) tried to replicate the
work of Pasamanick et al. (1960), but his
results did not support much of the earlier
research. Initially, Zelnik used data on
births to Baltimore residents from 19611965 for the highest and lowest socioeconomic categories determined by Pasamanick and his colleagues; his analysis
indicated that births were seasonal for all
social status groups. Zelnik then reanalyzed the birth data from the Pasamanick study (1952-56). Contrary to the
conclusions reached by Pasamanick et al.,
Zelnik’s analysis indicated that the pattern of births for the upper-fifth so

cioeconomic status group was significantly
seasonal. He noted that another weakness
in the analysis by Pasamanick was the
failure to show how the factors (i.e., climate, nutrition, and family planning)
functioned to lead to a uniform pattern of
monthly births for the upper socioeconomic status groups. Zelnik concluded (p. 164):

Although upper socioeconomic status categories can modify the effects of climate to a
greater extent than can lower social status
categories, practice better nutritional
habits, and utilize birth control devices
more frequently and more efficiently,
nothing about these activities need necessarily lead to a uniform monthly distribution of births. In fact, greater control of climate, nutrition, and fertility could just as
easily lead to increasing amounts of
monthly variability. . . .Even more importantly (in terms of uniform distributions of
births), factors such as holidays, timing of
school year, and customary vacation practices may also play a part in the timing of
births.

In an attempt to clarify the discrepancy
between the Pasamanick and Zelnik conclusions, Chaudhury (1972) examined the
relationship between socioeconomic status and season of birth in Baltimore from
1968-69. Using the same definition of status as Pasamanick et al. and Zelnik,
Chaudhury found (p.67), ‘“‘The distribution of births in the highest fifth of whites
shows no significant difference from rectilinearity. The finding of an even distribution of births among the highest socioeconomic fifth of whites is contrary to
the findings of Zelnik (1969).”

MATERIALS AND METHODS

To test the relationship between social
status and season of birth, we used available data from Fulton County, Georgia.
Fulton County data was chosen for the following reasons: (1) The racial composition of Fulton County is such that seasonal
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:38 08 December 2015

fertility patterns for two groups, whites
and all other races, could be analyzed separately for each social status group; and
(2) the data included a sequential elevenyear period, so that the year-to-year consistency of the seasonal patterns could be
tested.

DATA

The data used in this research were
live-birth statistics obtained from the
Fulton County Health Department in
Georgia for the years 1967-77. Geographically, Fulton County, is the central
county in the 1970 Atlanta Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area. The data reported include only live births to women
15-44 years of age who were residents of
Fulton County and who gave birth within
the county’s geographic boundary. The
report thus excludes an estimated annual
6.5 per cent of births to residents of Fulton
County which occur outside the county.

The percentage of births per month—
the dependent variable in this study—was
computed using a two-step, twelve-month
adjustment procedure. First, all monthly
totals were converted to thirty-day
equivalent values. This adjustment removes differences due to varying numbers
of days in the months and leap years. Second, the number of births in each month
(the numerator) was divided by the
summed total number of births (the denominator) which occurred between 5.5
months before and 5.5 months after the
numerator month. This adjustment removes the effect of yearly population
change. The resulting adjusted monthly
percentages of births from July 1967
through June 1977 were used in our analyses.

Social status of the census tract of residence of the mother was the primary independent variable of this study. Social status was defined according to the
classification scheme developed by Smith

Social Status and Season of Birth 277

(1973). Because the Fulton County
Health Department does not tabulate
birth certificate information on educational attainment of the mother, census
tract data provided the only measure of
social status available in the data set.
Smith’s classification scheme had an index
based on two factors (education and
crowding), data for which were obtained
from the 1960 and 1970 U.S. census publications: (1) median school years completed, persons 25 years old and over, and
(2) percentage of housing units with 1.01
or more persons per room.

The relative socioeconomic rank for
each census tract in Fulton County was obtained with these indices used collectively,
and four separate status categories were
defined for 1960 and 1970 (upper, uppermiddle, lower-middle, and lower). Two
census tracts, 27 and 68, were excluded
from the socioeconomic classification.
Tract 27 represented the central business
district, and Tract 68 contained only the
Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. The upper
socioeconomic stratum was defined as that
stratum having census tracts with the lowest rank values (indicating highest education and lowest crowding) and containing
25 per cent of the population. The lowest
status stratum had the highest rank values
(indicating lowest educational and highest
crowding) and also contained 25 per cent
of the population. To improve the social
status group homogeneity, the 1960 stratum rank was compared to the 1970 rank,
and only those census tracts whose social
status had remained stable were included
in our study. The geographic location of
the census tract by social status category is
shown in Figure 1.

Race of mother was included as a controlin this study. The two racial categories
were white and all other races. The racial
composition of Fulton County’s births
changed over the 11 years, with the percentage for all other races increasing from

47 per cent in 1967 to over 66 per cent in
1977 (Table 1). The decline in number of
white births occurred in all four social status groups, and the increase in number by
the all-other-races group was in the upper
and upper-middle status categories.

RESEARCH METHOD

In most of the reported research
describing seasonal variation in live

. births, one of two indexing procedures

was used: (1) a number index, with the

average monthly number of births for a
year equaling 100.0 (Rosenberg, 1966); or
(2) a percentage index with the average
monthly percentage of births equaling 8.3
per cent (Pasamanick et al., 1960; Zelnik,
1969; Chaudhury, 1972). Both methods
characterize the monthly fluctuations in
births as the deviation of the observed
from the expected values (100.0 or 8.3 per
cent). Because the index methods are
computed either for individual years or for
summed groups of years, pattern changes
over replicate years cannot be tested.

In attempting to avoid this methodologic problem, Kutner et al. (1978) applied
periodic regression analysis (PRA) as an
analytic technique to model cyclic demographic phenomena. Kutner used PRA
because the fundamental length of the cycle was known (one year) and the number
of data points in each cycle were equally
spaced and small in number. Also, by using PRA, Kutner made a statistical evaluation of the assumption of a constant amplitude (the heights of peaks or the depths
of troughs in the cycle) and phase angle (a
shortening or lengthening of the fundamental time period of each cycle). Other
approaches to modeling cyclic phenomena include time series ‘“‘moving average”’
techniques, which assume constant amplitude and phase, and Box-Jenkins analysis,
a technique used in economic and business

the fitted line to a level which is essentially
random, thus separating the periodic components from the random variations. The
regression equation used in PRA differs
from the general polynomial regression
equation in that the former includes trigonometric functions of time (harmonic
terms) as well as replicate effects to
measure annual trends (year terms) and
interaction effects. The goodness of fit of
the regression equation can be tested by
analysis of variance. Statistical tests can be
used in detecting significant changes or
trends in the heights of peaks or the depths
of troughs in the cycle (amplitude) andina
shortening or lengthening of the fundamental time period of each cycle (phase)

cate no seasonal trend. However, for the
other three status groups—upper-middle,
lower-middle, and lower—the seasonal
patterns of birth are significant (Table 2,
Row 2: P = 0.001 for each). The seasonal
patterns of birth for the upper-middle and
lower-middle status groups are similar,
with birth having a significant one harmonic term cycle (Table 2, Row 3:
p = 0.001 for each). The lower-status
seasonal pattern includes two significant
harmonic terms (Table 2, Rows 3 and 4:
P = 0.001 for each). The seasonal patterns for the upper-middle, lower-middle,
and lower status groups have essentially
the same trough and peak times, with a
trough from January through June and
peak from July through December (Figure 2). The only difference is in the maximum and minimum points for the groups.
The seasonal pattern for births to the upper-middle status group reaches its maximum in September and minimum in
March. The lower-middle status pattern
has an October maximum and an April
minimum. The lower-status pattern has an
August maximum and an April minimum.
The amplitude and phase angles did not
shift over the eleven-year time period for
any of the status groups.

Three differences are detected when
the lower-status seasonal pattern is com
pared with those for the other status
groups. First, the lower-status pattern has
a November inflection point which is not
found in the other patterns. The inflection
point is indicative of a slight upturn in the
lower-status pattern which causes the January point to be above average (Figure 2).
Second, the amplitude of the trough and
peak for the lower-status groups is greater
than those for the other groups. Third, the
lower-status pattern peaks in August,
whereas those for the upper-middle and
lower-middle status groups peak in September and October, respectively (Figure
2).

These findings suggest that seasonal
variation in births tends to increase with
lower social status. The lower-status
seasonal pattern has greater amplitude
than the patterns for the other status
groups, and the fit of the periodic curve to
the observed data for the lower-status
group ts statistically strong, accounting for
92.3 per cent of the monthly variance, relative to the fit of the regression equations
for the other status groups (lower-middle,
70.6 per cent; upper-middle, 64.6 per cent
and upper, no significant seasonal trend).

significant seasonal variation (Table 3,
Row 2: P = 0.34). Because there were
few births in the lower-middle and lowerstatus groups, the births for these two status groups were combined into one group
referred to as the lower-middle/lower status group. The seasonal patterns for upper-middle and lawer-middle/lower
whites are significant (Table 3, Row 2:
P = 0.01 and P = 0.07, respectively). The
seasonal pattern of births for the uppermiddle and lower-middle/lower groups
are similar with both having a significant
one harmonic term equation (Table 3,
Row 3: P = 0.001 for each).

The seasonal patterns for the uppermiddle and lower-middle/lower groups
differ in the amplitude of the variation and
in the timing of the maximum and minimum points. The upper-middle pattern
peaks in October and is lowest in April,
while the lower-middle/lower pattern is
slightly greater in amplitude and peaks in
November and is lowest in May (Figure
3).
For the all-other-races group, births for
the upper status also show no seasonality
(Table 4, Row 2: P = 0.33). However, for
the other status groups—upper-middle,
lower-middle, and lower—the seasonal
patterns of birth are significant (Table 4,
Row 2: P = 0.001 for each). The seasonal
pattern of births for the upper-middle and
lower-middle groups are similar, with

each having a significant one harmonic

for each). The lower status group’s
seasonal pattern includes two significant
harmonic terms (Table 4, Rows 3 and 4:
P = 0.001 for each).

The seasonal trough and peak times for
the all-other-races category are similar for
the upper-middle, lower-middle, and
lower groups, with a January through
June trough and July through December
peak (Figure 4). However, the maximum
and minimum times differ, and the amplitude of pattern for the lower group is
much greater than that for the middle
groups. The upper-middle pattern peaks
in September and the lower-middle pattern peaks in October; but the pattern for
the lower status group has a major peak in
August and a minor peak in January.

Four important points can be made
from a comparison of the seasonal patterns by race. First, for both whites and all
other races, seasonal variation in births
tends to increase with lower social status.
For both racial classifications, the largest
seasonal amplitude is in the pattern for the
lower status group; upper status births
have no significant seasonal variation.
Second, when comparisons between racial
categories are made, the seasonal amplitude of the all-other-races upper-middle
group is significantly higher than that
of the white upper-middle group

(P = 0.001); and the seasonal amplitude
of the all-other-races lower group is
significantly higher than that of the white
lower-middle/lower group (P = 0.001).
Third, the all-other-races lower group has
the only seasonal variation pattern with
peak birth times in August. The all-otherraces upper-middle group peaks in September, but both white status groups (upper-middle and lower-middle/lower) have
late fall peaks (October and November,
respectively). Fourth, the seasonal patterns found in these analyses for both racial groups and all status classifications
show no significant pattern changes in amplitude or phase angle over the elevenyear time period studied.

DISCUSSION

Our findings show that seasonal variation in births tends to increase with lower
social status. Births to upper status women of both major racial groups in Fulton
County, Georgia, show no consistent seasonal variability, but births to the lowermiddle/lower group of whites and the
lower group in the all-other-races category have definite seasonal patterns.
Further, for the all-other-races lower

group, the major peak in births occurs in
August with a minor peak in January.
Also, the lower-middie and lower groups
for all-other-races have greater seasonal
amplitudes than those for lower-middle/
lower whites. The seasonal trends for the
upper-middle whites and for all-otherraces are Similar unimodal cycles. There is
no indication from this analysis that the
Status and/or racial seasonal pattern
differentials are changing. The patterns
found were consistent over the entire
eleven-year period covered in this study.
We acknowledge two limitations to the
conclusions reached in this study. First,
we analyzed a single urban area in the
southeastern United States and thus our
conclusions may not be generalizable to
the state, region, or nation. Second, 93
per cent of the births occurring to Fulton
County residents each year were included
in our study. Although this count is admittedly incomplete, we believe it is sufficient
to give an accurate representation of the
seasonal patterns by race and social status.
In a comparison of our results with
those from the Baltimore studies, four
points can be made. First, in all three
Baltimore studies and in our analysis the
seasonal pattern for the upper status
births was less distinct than for the lower

status births’. Statistically, results from our
analysis support the findings of Pasamanick et al. (1960) and Chaudhury
(1972), that is, that no significant seasonal
pattern was found for the upper status
births. Our analysis found no significant
seasonal pattern for upper status births in
either social group, whites or all other
races, while the Baltimore studies were
limited to whites.

Second, our methods of analysis were
quite different from those used in the earlier studies. Periodic regression analysis
fits a harmonic term regression equation
to the observed monthly data over the entire time period studied, allowing the
goodness of fit of this regression equation
to be tested. In the three Baltimore
studies, summed yearly data were used to
produce monthly indices, and the statistical difference of the monthly indices was
not tested. Also, since the data in the
Baltimore studies represented a summary
total over a number of years, the consistency of the pattern for each individual
year was not analyzed. Therefore, some of
the differences found in the studies by Pasamanick et al. (1960), Zelnik, (1969) and
Chaudhury (1972) could result from an
undetected year-to-year change in seasonality.

Third, our study included a more detailed analysis of the social status seasonal
patterns for the all-other-races category
than did the Baltimore studies. The racial
composition of births in Fulton County,
shown in Table 1, is such that the number
for the all-other-races category over the
eleven years studied was sufficiently large
for analytical purposes.

Fourth, Pasamanick et al. and Zelnik

‘We have reanalyzed the Baltimore data for
1971-65 which Zelnik kindly provided us. Using
PRA and analysis of variance, we could not find the
seasonal variation that he described for all social status groups. Reanalysis showed no seasonality for
births to upper socioeconomic status groups in Baltimore during this time period.

Social Biology

discussed possible factors (such as climate, nutrition, and holidays) which
might influence or account for seasonal
variation in births. We had no data available to test the effect of these factors on the
seasonality of births in Fulton County, but
we do offer a brief critique of four possible
explanatory factors: climate, reproductive
biology, nutrition, and cultural events.

Climate, a factor often mentioned as
the underlying cause for the seasonality of
births (see Pasamanick et al., 1961; Takahashi, 1964, Chang et al., 1963; Rosenberg, 1966), has not consistently proved to
be an acceptable explanatory factor. One
study (Rosenberg, 1966) found that countries with climates similar to that of the
United States have mirror-image seasonal
patterns of birth. However, another study
(Cowgill, 1966) compared the monthly
variation in births in adjacent portions of
Mexico and the United States and found
different seasonal patterns.

Biological explanations are not sufficient to explain either the fact that
seasonality is found in human reproduction or the differences in seasonality that
occur among human population groups.
In discussing the human female, Parkes
(1968) has stated that he does ‘“‘not know
of any reliable evidence that the overt established menstrual cycle of the female
shows seasonal changes that might suggest
seasonal changes in fertility.”

Frisch (1978) concluded that chronic
malnutrition and severe undernutrition
have a negative influence on reproductive
development in young females, the length
of reproductive life, and the efficiency of
reproduction; but the results of efforts to
relate seasonality of births to nutrition
have been inconclusive (Pasamanick et
al., 1960; Bongaants, 1980).

Cultural holidays and festivals can possibly influence seasonal variation in fertility in two ways: (1) Sexual activity may increase during festive times, because

people are relaxed and carefree, and thus
the probability of conception might increase (Cowgill, 1966; Parkes, 1968;
James, 1971); or (2) socioreligious taboos
May sanction sexual abstinence so the
probability of conceiving will be deterred
(see Johnson et al., 1975; Scaglion, 1978).

Climate, reproductive biology, and nutrition do not appear to have sufficient
analytical support as explanatory factors,
but there is adequate support in certain
countries for sociocultural events being
important in defining appropriate times
for sexual activity. Possibly the most important point of this critique is to suggest
the need for additional thorough research
into the explanation for the seasonality of
births.

CONCLUSION

As an opening question we asked, Is
the seasonal variation in births influenced
by social status? Results from our analysis
suggest that the answer is yes. For both
groups, whites and all other races, season
Social Status and Season of Birth 287

al variation in births tends to increase with
lower social status. For both racial groups,
upper status births have random monthly
variation and no Statistically significant
pattern.

Our findings show that births in the allother-races lower status group peak in
August, while those in the white lowmiddle/lower group peak in November.
On the average, over 40 per cent of the
births each year in the all-other-races
classification occur in the lower status
group, while only 25 per cent of the births
each year to whites occur in the lowmiddle/lower status group (Table 1).

As we indicated earlier, children born
in August-September have been shown to
experience poor early academic performance relative to children born in other
months because of a younger age at entry
into school. All racial and status groups
should be made aware of this negative relationship between timing of birth and
academic performance, but particularly
these groups whose births consistently
peak at that time.
