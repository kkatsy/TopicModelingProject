ABSTRACT: There are few studies of the interrelationships among breastfeeding, child spacing,
and child mortality in traditional societies that incorporate extensive controls for social and
demographic characteristics of the mother and child. In this paper, we investigate the impact
of breastfeeding and the length of the preceding birth interval on early child mortality (defined
as a death in the first two years of life) using data from a traditional society of India. Multivariate
hazards models are used to analyze the data. Most prior analyses related the impact of
breastfeeding duration to the duration of child survivability by taking breastfeeding as a fixed
covariate. The present study has a methodological focus in the sense that breastfeeding information from retrospective survey data is treated as a time-dependent covariate both as a status
variate as well as a duration—with empirical findings compared across the two specifications.
The effects of postpartum amenorrhoea and various other demographic and socioeconomic

‘characteristics of mother and child are also studied. The results suggest that breastfeeding

duration has a strong impact in reducing the relative risk of early child mortality; but it does not

explain the effect of the length of the preceding birth interval on early child mortality.

Both high infant mortality and high
fertility rates are major concerns for
policy makers in developing countries
like India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.
Breastfeeding and birth spacing are
closely interrelated with each to some
extent, affecting the other. The study
of the effects of both breastfeeding and
birth spacing on child mortality has
long been plagued by problems of spuriousness and simultaneity (Millman,
1985; Millman and Palloni, 1984; Palloni and Tienda, 1986).

Most review articles on studies of
the link between breastfeeding and
child health and survival provide convincing evidence of the health benefits
of breastfeeding (Feachem and Koblinski, 1984; Jason et al., 1984; Anderson et al., 1984; WHO, 1989). It also is
now well established that short intervals between births are detrimental to

the health of both the mother and of
the children born at both ends of the
interval. Both pregnancy and lactation
require supplementation of the mother’s normal diet, and a short birth interval does not give sufficient time for
the mother to recuperate from the
birth and to replenish her stores of nutrients used during pregnancy. Repetitive short cycles of pregnancy and lactation lead to progressively higher risks
of low-birth-weight babies who have
lower chances of survival in the early
years. In addition, births spaced too
quickly pose constraints for the mother
in caring for and rearing the children.

The pernicious effects of rapid
childbearing on child-survival chances
have been the subject of research for at
least seventy years. Indeed, 1923 saw
the publication of two of the earliest
known studies in the area (Stevenson,

168
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

Vol. 41, No. 3-4

1923; Hughes, 1923). A complicating
factor is that the interaction between
lactation, child mortality, and fertility
varies not only from country to country
but also from one segment of the population to another within the same
country (Hobcraft et al., 1983, 1984;
Lantz et al., 1992; Miller et al., 1992;
Palloni and Millman, 1986; Retherford
et al., 1989; Rustin, 1983). We do not
have adequate information on this interaction in different situations. Further, the causal relationship among
breastfeeding, birth spacing, and child
mortality becomes complicated in the
presence of a number of other explanatory variables like age of mother, sex
of the child, birth order, and socioeconomic status. Some prior studies are
limited by treating the duration of
breastfeeding as either a categorical or
a current status covariate. This treatment may affect the empirical results
obtained. More research efforts are
needed to isolate the role of breastfeeding from the other confounding
factors as well as to overcome these
methodological limitations.

In the present paper, the relationships of early child mortality, defined
as a death in the first two years of life,

to the pace of childbearing and breast-.

feeding are studied through multivariate hazards modelling in a traditional
Indian Society. Breastfeeding is universal and lengthy in India, especially
in rural areas. Aside from its contraceptive effect, breastfeeding provides
protection against malnutrition and infectious diseases that is very important
for child survival, especially in rural areas where access to modern medical facilities is quite limited. Breastfeeding
provides protection against morbidity
and mortality, especially during the

first year of life (Habicht, et al., 1986;
Cunningham, 1988); even partial
breastfeeding has been found to be
beneficial (Habicht et al., 1988). However, relatively few rigorous studies
of all three variables—birth spacing,
breastfeeding, and child survivability
—simultaneously and in the presence
of controls for other variables have
been done in contemporary India.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS

Data for the research presented
here come from the retrospective survey, “A Study on Effects of SocioEconomic Factors on Fertility among
Scheduled Caste Population in the
Rural Areas of Karimganj District, Assam” conducted during 1988-89 (the
reference date for survey questions
was June 15, 1988) under the auspices
of University Grants Commission
(UGC), New Delhi. |

The survey was confined to only the
scheduled caste population—the backward and economically deprived class
of the Indian population. They are in
the lowest class of Hindu society—a |
caste system of social organization
found in old India and continuing to
the present day. Membership in a caste
is hereditary and is fixed for life. A
couple was defined as eligible for the
present study if both the partners were
alive on the reference date of the survey and the age of the female spouse
was less than 50 years. Information on
the status of the women—menstrupregnant, amenorrheic, or

menopausal—on the reference date
was obtained, and those who had
reached menopause were excluded.

The Karimganj district of Southern
Assam is predominantly a Bengalispeaking area, where a large number
of villages are identified as scheduled
caste villages. If at least 10 per cent of
the village population belongs to the
scheduled castes, the village is considered to be a scheduled caste village by
the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Assam. From the list of scheduled caste villages of the district, a sample of 39 villages was selected by simple
random sampling. Then, all scheduled
caste households were enumerated.
The survey comprises 1,805 scheduled
caste households from the selected
villages.

The objectives of this survey were to
obtain reliable data relating to fertility,
to study the socioeconomic and behavioral factors affecting fertility, and to
estimate biocultural parameters of human reproduction in traditional societies. In addition to other information,
data were collected on age at marriage,
total number of children ever born and
surviving, including details about duration variables—lactation, postpartum
amenorrhea (PPA), timing of birth,
timing of child death, etc.—for all
births occurring within the last seven
years for each married, eligible female
in the household.

Life history events were dated to the
year and month through the use of a
calendar of local events, such as notable ceremonies like Annaprasan (introduction of rice as solid food for the
first time), festivals like Durga Puja,
Holi, Dipavali, Makar Sankranti, severe drought, eclipse, and administrative or political events. The limitations

reliable information on duration of

breastfeeding and life history events
must be acknowledged and interpretations of substantive results of the analyses reported below suitably qualified.
Nonetheless, short of ‘prospective
panel data (which are nonexistent for
traditional Assam populations), this
method is the only manner such information can be obtained. To address the
substantive questions raised in the introduction to this paper, we report
analyses of this unique set of data.

Only those eligible couples who did
not practice any method of family planning to space and limit birth and for
which husband and wife were normal
residents of the village were considered. As the survey was restricted to
the scheduled caste population, a
grouping of subcastes was done for
the present analysis, each group having
its own distinct social organization
and culture. Educational attainment
among these groups of people is very
low, and most of them are still engaged
in traditional occupations like agriculture, fishing, cloth washing, hair cutting, cane works, pot-making, and
basket-making. Only a small number
of persons were employed in government or nontraditional private sector
jobs.

In the present analysis, the impacts
of eight independent variables on the
duration of child survival up to the age
of 24 months are examined. These covariates are (i) mother’s age the birth
of a child, (ii) length of preceding birth
interval, (iii) parity of mother, (iv) sex
of child, (v) mother’s education, (vi)
subcaste, (vii) PPA, and (viii) breastfeeding. A woman’s age at the birth of
a child is known to be an important determinant in analyzing the risk of infant death. To investigate the effect of

age, mothers were categorized according to their age at the birth of a child as:
(1) <25 years, (IJ) 25-35 years, and

(IIT) 35-43 years. The length of the

preceding birth intervals were defined
as (J) <15 months, (J) 15-27
months, and (J/7) = 27 months. Mothers were categorized according to level
of education as (i) those who had no
schooling or elementary schooling
(1-5 years of schooling), and (ii) middle schooling and beyond (6 or more
years of schooling). In countries such
as India, where a preference for male
children exists, it is believed that
breastfeeding patterns depend on the
infant’s sex. Thus, we examine the
roles of both mother’s age and child’s
sex on the interval of interest.

ANALYTICAL METHODS

A major problem in using interval
data (e.g., birth intervals, duration of
child survival, duration of breastfeeding, etc.) from a retrospective survey is
the incompleteness of the maternity
histories of the women, except for the
oldest cohort. The incompleteness
generally creates two types of problems, viz., censoring and selectivity,
which are difficult to tackle both statistically and substantially. Censoring
occurs when intervals are interrupted
by the interview itself. Open intervals
are biased toward long intervals, and
closed intervals are biased toward
short intervals. The problem of censoring can be handled through the application of life table techniques (Namboodiri and Suchindran, 1989) or the
incorporation of the life table approach
into a multivariate procedure (Cox,
1972). The selectivity problem is that
the intervals available for analysis may
be only a selected subset of the uni

verse of interest. While it may at first
seem natural to analyze all the intervals reported by retrospective histories, to do so biases the analysis toward
younger ages at initiation, toward the
experience of older birth cohorts, and
toward the experience of most recent
time periods.

The selection bias in demographic
studies arising from retrospective surveys has been addressed by several
authors (Rodriguez and Hobcraft,
1980; Rindfuss et al., 1982; Vaupel and
Yashin, 1985; Heckman and Walker,
1990; Rogers, 1992). Rindfuss et al.
(1982) suggested a method to overcome selectivity bias while analyzing
interval data from a retrospective survey. Following the guidelines of Rindfuss et al., we have selected a subset of
the available set of retrospective data
for analysis—that which is bounded by
current (at survey date) ages 12.and 43
and which occurred in the six years
ending a year before survey as indicated (shaded area) in the Lexis diagram shown in Figure 1.

For the present study, the duration
of child survival is measured by the interval between date of birth and time
of death if it occurs on or before 24°
months, which is an uncensored observation. No account is taken of multiple
births. Censored observations may
occur in two ways: (i) if a child survives .
at least 24 months prior to reference
date of survey, and (ii) if the interval
between birth and the reference date
of survey is less than 24 months and
the child survives up to the reference
date. In the following models, the
probability of death depends on the
duration of child survival and on a set
of independent variables which describe characteristics of the mother and

the environment in which the baby
lives. All mothers with at least two
births were considered. The independent variables fall into two categories:
fixed characteristics, which take the
same value in every month of observation for a given woman, such as age,
education, etc.; and variable characteristics, such as breastfeeding status
which may take a different value in
each month of observation.

Factors other than simple lactational status that might have an effect
on the time of death of child can be
identified through the application of a
multivariate hazards model, a nonlinear regression technique which builds
on a product limit life table (Cox,

1972). The value of this technique is
that it permits a regression analysis of
censored data and provides an estimate
of the relative magnitudes of the hazards to which different subgroups are
subject.

The hazards function or instantaneous mortality risk function at time ¢
is given by

h(t, z) = A@exp(B,Z) = 1)

where A(t; Z) represents the instantaneous risk of child death at time 4
Z = (21, 22, +++ 5 2) is a set of fixed
covariates, A(t) is an arbitrary nonnegative unspecified baseline hazard
function not dependent on covariates,
and B, is a vector of unknown regres

sion coefficients to be estimated. The
breastfeeding variables were examined
in two separate specifications in order
to ease interpretational difficulties of
time-dependent covariates and to reduce computer costs.

The first model specifies the hazard
for child mortality up to ¢ months as
follows:

A(t; z) = h(Qexp{B.Z + Bsl()} (2)

where /(f) is an indicator variable assuming a value 1 if the mother is
breastfeeding ¢ months after birth of
the child and 0 if she is not breastfeeding. The f, and B; are unknown regression coefficients. Note that the indicator variable J(t) simply examines
whether or not breastfeeding status
(current status) influences:the risk of
death at failure time. Also, by interacting a particular independent variable and /(t) variable, one can examine
the question of whether the effect of
current breastfeeding status on the rate
of death varies among subgroups of the
population defined by the variable.
However, such a categorical specification of breastfeeding does not account
for effects of the duration of breastfeeding if it has stopped prior to the
time point at which the hazard is estimated. To include the duration of

‘breastfeeding, the following specifica
tion of the model was used:
h(t; z) = h(thexp{B,Z + BsBD(} (3)

where BD(t) = minimum (t, duration
of breastfeeding). Note that for mothers who have stopped breastfeeding
before t, BD(t) will be the duration of
breastfeeding, and for those still continuing breastfeeding, BD(t) will be
the time point of consideration. Again,
limitations of these definitions must be

acknowledged. For instance, the retrospective survey data available to us do
not permit distinctions between full
and partial (supplemented) breastfeeding.

The hazard functions in Models I,
II, and III allow estimation of relative
risks of other groups in relation to specific baseline groups by the exponent of
the regression coefficient exp(.). Each
element of the coefficients exp(.) represents the effect of covariates on the
hazards function for a given group as
compared to the reference group.
When covariates are present, the
exp(.) term reduces to unity. Values
greater than unity indicates the relative
risk of giving birth is greater for this
group, compared with the reference
group, whereas values less than unity
indicate a decrease in the risk.

RESULTS

This analysis is based on 4,020 censored and 618 uncensored observations. Results under six different
specifications—by excluding and including some of the variables involved

—of hazards modelling are presented

in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Model estimates
under these different specifications are
exhibited so that empirical results may
be compared and studied for trends
and robustness.

Model I in Table 1 estimates the effects of preceding birth intervals and
different sociocultural and biological
variables excluding breastfeeding and
PPA. The results indicate that preceding birth intervals of length =27
months, parity of mother, sex of child,
mother’s education, and subcaste have
significant effects on early child mortality. |

Model II expands on Model I by introducing PPA into the model. The objective is to see whether the estimates
in Model I will change if this control
factor is included. It is observed that
w:th the introduction of PPA as control
variable, the effect of parity of mother

It appears that estimates of regression coefficients provided by the multivariate hazards model, where both
PPA and breastfeeding are considered
under the same setup, show excellent
and meaningful results (see Table 3).
In Table 3, under Model VI, we find
variations in mortality among children
with the specified birth intervals are
statistically significant. Babies born to
mothers who do not have sufficient re
covery times following a birth before
next pregnancy have lower survival
chances. Children born between 15-27
months and on or after 27 months from
the preceding birth are 25 per cent and
72 per cent less likely respectively, to
die in the first 24 months of their lives
as compared to children born after less
than 15 months from the preceding
birth.

The risk of death for children relative to mother’s age at the birth is
higher for mother’s age less than 25

VI), the effects of parity become insignificant. The relative risk of death of a
male child as compared to female child
is approximately 0.4.

With regards to mother’s education,
the results follow the expected direction. Mother’s education has direct influences on both child care and living
standard, and thus it is a good indicator
of child life circumstances. The results
indicate that education is negatively

related to early child mortality. Children belonging to the illiterate/
nominal education group of mothers
have significantly higher (1.327 times
in Model VI) hazards of death than
those born to educated mothers. Significant variation in the early child
mortality rate also is observed among
different subcaste groups. The relative
rates of early child mortality are low
for children belonging to both Kaibarta
and other subcastes as compared to the
Namasudra subcaste. For every additional month of PPA duration of a
mother, the risk of death of a child is
decreased by 2 to 7.34 per cent under
three different model specifications.
After controlling for sociocultural
and demographic factors, breastfeeding has a strong significant influence on
the risk of child death. The estimated
regression coefficients for breastfeeding show that at any given point, the
risk of early childhood mortality is reduced by 75 (39) per cent under Model
III (V) if the mother is breastfeeding at
that time, compared to the risk among
women not breastfeeding at that time.
Results from the model specifying
breastfeeding duration with selected
sociocultural and demographic factors
appear in Tables 2 (Model IV) and 3
(Model VI). Results from these models
show breastfeeding duration has highly
significant negative effects on the rate

of early child mortality~about a 6.5.

(5.6) per cent reduction under Model
IV (VI) for every additional month of
breastfeeding. Thus, under Model VI,
if a child is breastfed for six months,
the relative risk of dying in the first 24
months of life is 0.71 (exp[—0.0560 x
6]) compared to a child who is never
breastfed. Further, it is estimated and
found that the interactions of breast

DISCUSSION

Breastfeeding practices in traditional Indian Society are consistent
with child rearing practices in most traditional societies in which breastfeeding is seen not only as a way of delaying
the next birth but also as a cheap
source of nutrition for the survival of
the child. In rural areas of India,
women continue to breastfeed their
children exclusively for up to eight
months and in some cases even for
twelve months (Khan, 1990). Nath et
al. (1993) reported that the life table
median duration of breastfeeding of
the Assam survey is 16 months. Demand feeding is the rule, and infants
are fed between eight to fourteen times
during 24 hours of a day in poor seg-.
ments of the population of India
(WHO, 1981). With demand feeding
the rule, it is extremely difficult to collect information on the impact of supplementary feeding on the frequency
or the duration of suckling. In particular, the data analyzed here do not
provide any information to differentiate between full and partial breastfeeding.

One obvious mechanism causing
poor survival chances—which cannot
be fully dealt with in the present study
because of data limitations—is the maternal health depletion syndrome. A
mother with repeated pregnancies and
especially short birth intervals does
not have sufficient time for recovery,
both physically and nutritionally, and
is more likely to have low-birth-weight
babies. There is much evidence that

low-birth-weight babies have poor survival chances, even into early childhood. Thus, the preceding birth interval often shows up as a significant
determinant of early child mortality.
This is the case in the results reported
above—which indicate that there is a
negative relationship between the
length of time between the birth of the
index child and the preceding birth and
early child mortality, so that the longer
the interval, the lower the risk of child
death. In this traditional society, we
find that children born to mothers following birth intervals of less than 15
months have higher risks of death during early childhood—a finding that survives and even grows stronger when
controls for PPA and breastfeeding,

-especially breastfeeding duration, are

introduced into the hazards models.
Children born to the youngest (< 25
years) birth cohort mothers also are
more susceptible to death within first
two years of their lives.

As long as the child is on the breast,
it receives assured nourishment independent of the socioeconomic status
of the family. But when the child is
weaned, its health depends on nourishment apart from breastmilk, and the
availability and quality of such nourishment is influenced by the socioeconomic status of the family. Mother’s
education represents household socioeconomic status in the present study.
As expected, children born to illiterate
or nominally educated women have
higher risks of death. Mother’s education shows up as a strong predictor of
early child mortality. Indian society
also is known for its preference for
sons. The estimated lower risk of male
deaths measures this sex bias against
the female child. Birth order also has

substantial effects on early child mortality before the introduction of breastfeeding as an explanatory variable.

Examination of the relationship between breastfeeding and duration of
child survivability needs special techniques because a child can change from
a breastfeeding status to nonbreastfeeding status during the survivability
interval of a survey. Previous investigations of the impact of breastfeeding
on child mortality have related duration of survivability to breastfeeding as
a categorical variable. However, since
in such specifications, breastfeeding
may be longer than the duration of
child survival, estimates of the effects
of breastfeeding in these studies may
be biased. We deal with this problem
using the only calculable values available in this survey of traditional Indian
society—through a specification of
hazard regression models in which
breastfeeding is constructed in a timedependent setting.

Our results show that breastfeeding,
whether measured as a current status
covariate or as a duration variable,
consistently reduces the risk of early
child mortality—even in the presence
of controls for several other demographic and socioeconomic status
variables. This finding appears to contradict the results of Palloni and Millman’s (1986) study of data from 12
Latin American countries in which
breastfeeding did little to explain child
survivability. But it is consistent with
findings from Miller et al.’s (1992)
study of data from Bangladesh and
the Philippines and Retherford et al.’s
(1989) findings based on Nepal World
Fertility Data. They also concluded
that breastfeeding has important effects in reducing early child mortality

but does not explain the effects of a
short preceding birth interval in increasing the mortality hazard.

The strong explanatory power of
breastfeeding in the present study
probably occurs because of (i) universal and prolonged breastfeeding
practices, and (ii) higher early child
mortality. But it also must be acknowledged that the retrospective data utilized in the present study limit the
extent to which we can deal with prob
