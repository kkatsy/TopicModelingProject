— ABSTRACT: It is often asserted that sexual promiscuity and drug abuse appears to share a
“icommon etiology in poor parental attachment. This study explores this claim empirically among
© 480 college students. Other variables—religiosity, masculinity/femininity, sex, age, and physical
© appearance—that may enhance or reduce the incidence of promiscuity and drug use were
S included in multivariate analyses. Parental attachment was significantly related to both variA ables, and the combination of poor parental attachment and drug use was a strong predictor of
co promiscuity for both males and females. In multivariate analyses, religiosity was the most
S important predictor of promiscuity for males, and attachment was the most important for
Stfemales. The findings are examined guided by the three desiderata commonly accepted as

“relevant to biosocial attachment theory.

Rosenbaum and Kandel (1990)
Sofound that drug use is an important
‘5predictor of early onset of sexual acS tivity and note that because the two
‘Smajor modes of transmission of the
HIV virus are sexual contact and intra5 venous drug use, exploration into the
‘eS etiology of promiscuous sexuality and
illegal drug use is increasingly imporStant (p. 783). Sexual promiscuity and
'p drug use certainly constitute risk facStors for one another (Bainbridge and
‘e Crutchfield, 1983), but both behaviors
omay share common antecedent factors

rather than being causally connected.

Poor parental attachment is a major

candidate for such a factor (Hattfield,

an| at

1

1988; Shedler and Block, 1990; Harri- ~y

son et al., 1989; Gangestad and Simpson, 1990).

Clinicians have long asserted that
promiscuity is linked to a history of
poor parental attachment. Halleck
(1971) sees female promiscuity arising
from inadequate parental nurturance

95

which leads females to seek sex to satisfy their love and attention needs,
which they do with a “desperate
intensity. . . . The price for affection is
usually sexual intercourse” (p. 141).
Thus, early experience may “set” the
facultative reproductive strategy that
individuals follow at a later age (Belsky
et al., 1991; Chisholm, 1993; Cashdan,
1993).

Attachment is viewed by Bowlby
(1979) as a strong affectional bond between caregiver and child that affords
the child a sense of security and lays
down a foundation for future attachment behavior. Attachment theory
“holds that by the age of five to seven
ears children have usually developed
mental images or ‘internal working
models’ of social-emotional relationships based on the quality of their attachments ...” (Chisholm, 1993, p.
6). These “working models” become
etched in the neurophysiology of
the organism, as Kraemer (1992) has

demonstrated. Individuals lacking a
sense of parental attachment will tend
to be anxious and insecure, making
later peer attachments and committed
monogamous romantic attachments
problematic (Kernberg, 1974; Shaver
et al., 1988).

Regardless of its origins, promiscuity is often viewed as a manifestation of
some underlying pathology. Although
in some contexts it may be adaptive
(Buss and Schmitt, 1993), in the larger
and more general context it may minimize fitness, and it runs counter to
normative social expectations (Timmreck, 1990; Udrey, 1988; Hinde and
Stevenson-Hinde, 1990). Frost and
Chapman (1987) found “‘polymorphous sexuality” (the range of sexual
interests, attitudes, fantasies, and behavior) to be related to psychosis
proneness in two separate studies.
However, they were careful to make a
distinction between polymorphous sexuality and “hypersexuality”’ (promiscuity), which they indicate is more characteristic of manic-depression.

Some attachment theorists view sexual promiscuity as offering a series
of temporary balms for anxiety, insecurity, and depression that achieve
much the same effect as do the various
tranquilizers, narcotics, and sedatives
(Hatfield, 1988). Studies of the antecedents of substance abuse often find
it linked to lack of emotional attachments/commitments to others and to
self-rejection (Jessor and Jessor, 1977;
Textor, 1987; Kaplan et al., 1988;
Shedler and Block, 1990). Thus, it has
been suggested that drug abuse and
sexual promiscuity may be etiologically
and functionally analogous in that they
are alternative methods of dulling the

 

 

Social Biology

pains of anxiety and insecurity that are
the sequelae of nonattachment (Shaver
et al., 1988; Collins and Read, 1990).

Liebowitz (1983, p. 57) argues that
promiscuous individuals are “love addicts” driven by the need for phenylethylamine (PEA), an amphetaminelike drug that is endogenously secreted
in response to mating opportunities.
He views the constant craving for new
partners as craving for new highs as tolerance for the old lover (actually, for
PEA) sets in (see also, Ellis, 1991a).
Although there may be resistance to
the idea that promiscuous sexuality
may be chemically and psychologically
equivalent to drug addiction, Peele and
Brodsky (1975, p. 68) find it ‘‘not unreasonable to look for addiction among
lovers when psychologists find the
roots of drug addiction in childhood
dependency needs and stunted family
relations. . . . In this sense, addictive
love is even more directly linked to
what are recognized to be the sources
of addiction than is drug dependency”
(see also Timmreck, 1990).

From a biosocial perspective, Hinde
and Stevenson-Hind (1990, p. 65)
claim that there are three closely
linked desiderata relevant to attachment theory: (1) to maximize an individual’s inclusive fitness, i.e., the
lifetime reproductive success of an
individual and his or her close relatives; (2) to conform to the values of
society; and (3) to achieve psychological well-being. Promiscuity and drug
abuse violate these alleged desiderata.
Evolutionary theorists assert that because of differential parental investment, males and females have evolved
different mating strategies; sexual restrictiveness for females and sexual
 

Vol. 42, No. 1-2

unrestrictiveness for males (Symons,
1979, 1992; Wilson, 1983; Buss, 1989;
Ellis, 1989/1990; Kenrick et al., 1990;
Buss and Schmitt, 1993). Of course,
mating strategies are facultative, not
fixed, and it is clear that both strategies
are open to both sexes.

However, the fitness penalties attached to female unrestrictiveness are
potentially so severe that psychologi
‘2 cal and neurological mechanisms are
& rather strongly biased in the direction
9 of restrictiveness for females, particuE larly in a long-term mate. The fear of
3 cuckoldry leads males to abandon unA restricted women (Trivers, 1972; WilS son, 1983), and among dating couples,
~. partners of restrictive females are more
— committed to them than are partners of
* unrestrictive females (Gangestad and
=, Simpson, 1990). A national probability
5 sample of 815 American males found
S that 67 per cent reported disliking
4 women who made love too early
pin the relationship (Walsh, 1991a, p.
Z 226), and Buss and Schmitt (1993)
z found that men considered promiscu5 ity to be the least desirable attribute
>In a prospective long-term mate (alZ though slightly desirable in a prospec3 tive short-term mate).
g Some evolutionary theorists suggest
= that females with poor attachment ex© periences advance their reproductive
fitness by adopting a strategy of unrestricted sexuality (Gangestad and
Simpson, 1990; Belsky et al., 1991).

These theorists agree that restricted
sexuality, while generally constituting
the “‘optimum”’ strategy for females in
most environmental contexts because
it increases the probability of paternal
investment, is not always psychologically viable for women who have

Parental Attachment 97

learned that close relationships are undependable and ephemeral.! The strategy of unrestricted sexuality allegedly
increases a female’s chances of mating
with a “quality” (high status) male,
thus producing a genetically “quality”
offspring, despite the risk of losing paternal parental investment (see Hinde,
1991, and Maccoby, 1991, for critiques). Needless to say, neither strategy is consciously “‘chosen,”’ but rather .
flow from differential expectations of
stability/instability of interpersonal relationships based on past experience.

Because evolutionary theorists view
males as more strongly selected for
promiscuity than females, a measure
of masculinity/femininity was included
in this study. High scores on the
masculinity scale of the Bem Sex Role
Inventory (Bem, 1977) have been
found to correlate positively with testosterone levels, extraversion, sensation-seeking, and a large number of
sexual partners; high femininity scores
have been found to be negatively related to these variables (Daitzman and
Zuckerman, 1980).

Testosterone 1s the hormonal mediator of sexual arousal in both males
and females. Thus, it is assumed that
high masculinity scores (because masculinity has been linked to testosterone
levels) will be associated with a greater
number of coital partners for both
sexes, independent of attachment. As
Nyborg and Boeggild (1989, p. 29) put
it, testosterone switches women off

1Symons (1992) writes that human beings are selected to strive for specific goals (to be ‘‘adaptation
executors”), not for the general goal of being “‘fitness maximizers”’: “There can be no such thing as a
generalized reproduction-maximizer mechanism
because there is no general, universally effective
way to maximize reproduction” (p. 139). ~

their ‘“‘safety first approach and onto a
more masculine approach” [to sexual
activity]. In fact, although adult males
have 10 to 20 times more unbound
(activating) testosterone than adult
females, elevated testosterone has a
greater influence on female sexuality
(Udry, 1988). Among androgennormal males there are “ceiling effects” beyond which additional testosterone has no activating influence
(Ellis, 1986; Udry, 1988). Thus, high
masculinity scores may have more effect on female than male sexuality.

The reviewed literature on promiscuity has been almost exclusively concerned with female promiscuity, the assumption being that males have a
strong propensity to be promiscuous,
and that what we need to explain in the
male case is what makes them otherwise. A variable which may have an inhibiting affect on sexual behavior with
multiple partners, as well as on drug
abuse, is religiosity. Most major religions consider nonmarital sex to be
immoral (Burkett and Warren, 1986),
and there is perhaps no other behavior
where violation of moral standards is
so enduring and encompassing. Sexual
promiscuity has been found to be significantly negatively related to religiosity, regardless of whether religiosity is
measured attitudinally (Udrey, 1988;
Rosenbaum and Kandel, 1990) or behaviorally in terms of church attendance (Libby et al., 1978). Although
the cited research was conducted with
adolescents, there is no reason to suppose that religiosity would not have a
similar effect on adults.

Because it is usually the male who
initiates sexual activity (Glaser and
Thorpe, 1986; Ellis, 19915), variables
that serve to inhibit sexual activity,

 

Social Biology

such as religiosity or femininity, should
have greater impact on men than on
women. Men ask; women get asked.
Thus, the rate of asking should be related to various measured characteristics, but getting asked should be relatively unrelated to them. An exception
to this may be physical attractiveness.
Using interviewer’s subjective assessments of attractiveness, Udry and Billy
(1987) found no significant effects of
attractiveness on coital behavior. It is
difficult to believe that such an important facilitator of dating behavior
(Feingold, 1990) has no effect on coital
behavior, although the direction of its
effect may be problematic. Attractive
feminine women may be asked more
often, but their attractiveness may
afford them the luxury of being more
discriminating. Buss (1988) found that
women of high mate value (defined
primarily in terms of physical attractiveness) were more discriminating
than women of low mate value. On the
other hand, more masculine women
may go beyond the simple exercise of
veto power and do the asking themselves. Therefore, it was deemed advisable to include a measure of selfreported physical appearance in the
study. We expect that physical appearance will be positively related to number of coital partners for males and
negatively related for females.

In summary, this paper explores the
effect of poor parental attachment on
sexual activity and drug abuse. It is
hypothesized that individuals who
have learned that interpersonal relationships are reliable and stable will
have fewer sex partners and be less involved with drugs than those who have
learned that such relationships are unreliable and transient. Other variables

that may impact these behaviors by
predisposing, facilitating, or inhibiting
them, such as religiosity, masculinity/
femininity, appearance, and age will be
examined.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The sample consists of 480 university undergraduates (211 males and 269
females) enrolled in three classes at
Boise State University. The modal
number of coital partners is 1 for both
males and females, with the median
being 5 for males and 3 for females.
Males had a mean of 10.81 partners
(95% c.i. = + 1.88), and females
had a mean of 5.75 partners (95%
c.i. = + 0.82). Means and standard
deviations of all variables, broken
down by gender, are presented in
Table 2. |

The childhood attachment index
consists of six items in Likert format
designed to tap the amount of love,
caring, respect, value, and happiness
subjects perceived themselves as receiving from their parents as children
and adolescents (Table 1). Possible
‘scores on this index ranged between 5
and 30; actual scores ranged frem 8 to
30. A reliability coefficient of 0.865
was computed from these data.

Drug usage was assessed by asking
subjects the approximate number of
times they had tried illegal drugs. Actual values were coded between zero
and 9 times, with a score of 9 indicating
that the subject had taken drugs 9 or
more times. It is acknowledged that
this strategy resulted in the loss of variation in the higher range, but the analysis was constrained by data coding.
The modal category for both sexes was
zero (44.2 per cent for males and 52.7

more times (34.6 per cent for males
and 25.9 per cent for females). Thus,
21.2 per cent of the males and 21.4 per
cent of the females were drug “‘experimenters.”

Masculinity and femininity are measured by the Bem Sex Role Inventory
(Bem, 1977). The reliability coefficient
computed from the present data for
this scale is 0.888.

Physical appearance was selfassessed. Each subject was asked to
rate satisfaction with eight body parts
(height, weight, chest/bust, buttocks,
face, hair, genitals, and overall body
build) on a scale ranging from 1 to 9.
Scores ranged from 27 to 70. A reliability coefficient of 0.791 was computed from these data.

The religiosity variable was measured using both behavioral and attitudinal referents. Behaviorally, subjects
were asked how often they attend religious services for the purpose of worship: never, a few times a year, once a
month, once a week, or more than
once a week. Subjects were also asked
how important their religion was to

them on a 10-point scale (Udry, 1988).
The two measures were highly correlated (r = 0.71) and were combined
into a single religiosity factor. Scores
on this index ranged from 2 to 14, with
a possible maximum of 15.

RESULTS

Table 2 presents correlations (male
above, female below) between all variables and their means and standard deviations. Correlations between pairs of
variables that differ significantly (Fishers r to Z transformation) between the
sexes are underlined. Table 3 presents
t-tests for differences between male
and female means. for all variables.
Males had significantly more coital
partners, experienced more drug use,
and rated their masculinity and appearance significantly higher than females.
Females were significantly more feminine. There are no significant differences between the sexes on attachment, religiosity, and age.

The number of sexual partners
means reported here underestimates
male national means (12.26) and overestimates female national means (3.22)
based on a NORC representative sample of 1,401 adult Americans (Smith,
1991). This finding is probably due to
the smaller age variability in the
present sample.

Subjects’ evaluations of their parental attachment experiences are negatively and significantly related to sexual
promiscuity (the less the attachment,
the greater the number of sexual partners). The frequency of drug usage is
positively related to number of sexual
partners, particularly for females, although the t-test results show that

 

Parental Attachment

101

males were more likely to have used
drugs.

Religiosity is significantly and rather
strongly negatively related to promiscuity for males, but only weakly so for
females, even though the f-test shows
essentially identical religiosity means
for both genders. Masculinity is significantly and positively, but weakly, related to number of coital partners for
both genders; femininity has a significant negative effect for males, but no
significant effect for females.

Masculinity and femininity are both
negatively and significantly associated
with drug usage among males, a finding
that perhaps suggests a certain amount
of sex-role ambivalence among male
drug users. No relationship between
drug usage and masculinity or femininity is observed for females. .

A negative evaluation of one’s appearance is associated with more sexual partners among females, but no significant relationship is observed among
males. High masculinity among males
is associated with a more positive evaluation of appearance, but high masculinity among females is associated with
a negative evaluation of appearance.
Femininity scores have no effect on appearance evaluation for either sex.
High femininity scores are associated
with high religiosity for both sexes,
particularly for males.

I next regressed all variables on
number of sexual partners. With the
exception of appearance, all variables
entered the equation with significance
levels less than 0.05 (1-tail). The impact of childhood attachment and drug
abuse is diminished given the presence
of other variables in the model, with
age and religiosity being the most powerful predictor variables. The model

“Positive sign = male mean greater; negative sign = female

accounts for an impressive 46.8 per
cent of the variance in number of coital
partners.

The determinants of drug usage
were then addressed via multiple regression. Only religiosity, attachment,
and femininity entered the model, all
of which are negatively related to drug
usage. Age, sex, and masculinity, all
significantly related to drug usage at
the zero-order level, failed to enter
the regression equation. We are able
to say, then, that the less attached, the
less religious, and the less feminine a
person is, the more likely he or she is to
use drugs, with attachment being the
most powerful predictor.

Turning to the gender-specific models regressing all variables on number
of coital partners in Table 5, we note
that, apart from age, religiosity is the
most powerful predictor for males, but
the least powerful for females. Drug
usage is the most powerful predictor
for females, and the least important for
males. Attachment is the most consistent predictor across the two models.
Of greater interest are the variables
that operate in different directions for
males and females. Femininity is negatively related with number of sexual

 

Social Biology

partners for males, but positively related for females. Likewise,’a positive
evaluation of one’s appearance results
in significantly more sexual partners
for males, but significantly fewer for
females.

The male model accounts for considerably more of the variance in number of coital partners than does the
female model. The larger proportion
of variance accounted for in the male
model confirms suspicions that personal attributes have more influence on
initiators of behavior (usually males)
than on those who generally exercise
only veto power (females). Similar
differences in gender-specific models
of sexuality among adolescents were
reported by Udry (1988), i.e., adjusted
R squared values of 0.49 and 0.32 for
males and females, respectively.

DISCUSSION

Empirical support for the hypothesis that sexual promiscuity and drug
abuse may have a common cause in
the failure of parental attachment is
provided by these findings. Subjects
reporting weak parental attachment
were more involved in unrestricted
sexuality and reported more drug usage than subjects reporting stronger
parental attachment. Unrestricted sexual encounters may function as chemical “balms” for the insecurity wrought
by poor attachment experiences in
the same way that drugs may function
(Hatfield, 1988). The affectual process
is a continuous one, with each stage
preparing the individual for the next
one in a straight-line progression
(Hazan and Shaver, 1987). Any break
in this chain leaves the individual
without an adequate foundation from

How can these findings be situated
within the theoretical framework of attachment theory? Within the present
sample, the lack of attachment experience leads to promiscuity for both men
and women. Thus, while this lack has
predictable negative fitness effects for
women, it apparently has positive effects for males. That is, for males, poor

parental attachment apparently enhances the male’s alleged tendency toward promiscuity, and thus his reproductive potential. For females, poor
parental attachment reduces the female’s alleged tendency toward restrictiveness, which reduces the probability of male commitment and paternal
investment.

Interpretation of these data must include the fact that we are cultural animals who direct our behavior toward

goals which often have nothing to
do with the maximization of inclusive
fitness and may actually run counter to
it, even when the goals are sexual ones.
The plasticity of human beings is a
double-edged sword that can lead to
maladaptive as well as adaptive behavior (Symons, 1979, p. 307). The relationship between current behavior and
an adaptation depends on the consistency between the distal environmental features leading to selection of
the adaptation and the more proximate
environmental context in which it
is expressed (Thornhill and Thornhill,
1992). Within early evolutionary environments, male promiscuity may have
exerted pressure for selection, but in
terms of later cultural conditions such
behavior might prove to be counterproductive to fitness. As Shaver et al.
(1988, p. 94) put it, ‘““The function of

attachment between adult lovers may
be primarily to increase the likelihood
of parental health, stability, and investment in offspring.” Long-term evolutionary success may be better achieved
by producing fewer, high quality offspring in a committed relationship than
by maximizing number of offspring in
promiscuous mating (Chisholm, 1993,
p. 3; Buss and Schmitt, 1993, p. 221).

Commitment to child rearing certainly conforms to social values, and
religiosity supports such a value. Commitment to religious values serves as a
brake to unrestrictive sexual behavior
and to drug use. The fact that it inhibits
male sexuality more than female sexuality is not surprising. Religiosity prevents males from pursuing sexual favors, but a female’s religious values
to not preclude her from being pursued. They can, of course, prompt her
Vol. 42, No. 1-2

to refuse sexual overtures. But if she
is asked often enough, especially in
the context of romantic involvement
rather than in the context of impulsive sexual gratification, she will eventually accede (Juhasz and Sonnenshein, 1987).
Masculinity and femininity have diverse effects across the sexes. Mascuaiinity is positively related and feminin=ity is negatively related to number of
“coital partners among males, but only
Smasculinity is associated (positively)
swith number of partners among feAmales. Feminine women may be asked
cofor coitus more often than masculine
\owomen, but masculine women may be
csmore inclined to accept the offers they
receive. Masculine women may also
ratake the assertive approach in sexual
éamatters and initiate the encounter
‘Sthemselves. A recent study found mas=culinity to be more strongly correlated
Swith sexual “game playing” among
S¥emales than among males (Walsh,
©1993).
Drug use remained a significant pre“dictor of number of partners for both
sexes with all other predictor variables
‘in the regression models. However, it
Splays a very minor role for males while
‘Efor females it has about the same effect
Sas attachments. Females with an extensive history of drug use can reasonably be considered more disinhibited
than most other females, but while it
is probably also true that males who
use drugs are more disinhibited than
males who do not, there is no reason to
posit that this disinhibition necessarily
pushes them beyond the already high
level of sex-seeking that characterizes
most males. Being part of a drug subculture, however, places them in the
company of sexually unrestricted fe

males, thus increasing their opportunities for sex.

Other than age, a variable not requiring comment, the remaining significant predictor variable is subjective
evaluation of physical appearance. A
positive evaluation is significantly positively related to number of sexual
partners among males, but significantly
negatively related among females. This
finding is understandable if we consider the evaluation of one’s physical
appearance to be an indicator of overall self-esteem, and if we can agree
with Robertson (1987, p. 250) that sexual intercourse is seen as a conquest for
males and as a surrender for females,
and that a man’s status is enhanced by
his conquest and a woman’s cheapened
by her surrender (also, see Juhasz
and Sonnenshein-Schneider, 1987). A
man who considers his appearance to
be somewhat inadequate may be timid
about approaching females sexually.
Conversely, a lack of success in this
area may lead him to devalue his appearance. This view is supported by
Walsh (19916) who found that male
virgins had significantly lower selfesteem than sexually active males, but
female virgins and nonvirgins did not
differ significantly on self-esteem.

A woman with a high evaluation of
her appearance may feel that she has
the luxury of being discriminating
about with whom she becomes intimate, because she is likely to be the
recipient of more dating offers (Feingold, 1990). She is freer than her physically less desirable sisters from the necessity to compromise with the shortterm mating strategy of males, and
is thus more likely to “obtain a longterm mate of high quality who is willing to commit resources and parental

investment” (Buss and Schmitt, 1993,
p. 219). Thus, “high-value” women are
better able to maximize their reproductive fitness in environments in which
paternal resource investment is advantageous, which is almost any human
environment. A woman who views her
physical appearance negatively may
feel, due to a dearth of opportunity,
that she must conform to the male pattern of sexual behavior if she is to engage in any kind of relationship with a
male. As Symons (1980, p. 180) put it,
“the greater the disparity in sexual at
-‘tractiveness, the greater the necessary

payment.” On the other hand, it may
also be that promiscuous females have
a low evaluation of their appearance
because they are promiscuous, given
the greater social stigma attached to fe

male promiscuity (Zelnick and Kanter,
1980). |

In summary, this study adds to the
literature attesting to the many negative influences of the failure of the
childhood attachment process. The
lack of parental attachment was shown
in this study to be a significant predictor of number of sex partners and drug
usage. These behaviors are viewed as
attempts to assuage the pains of anxiety, insecurity, and loneliness experience by those lacking a history of positive attachment experiences. With the
significant increase in risk for AIDS
and other viral diseases that these two
behaviors bring with them (Smith,
1991), further exploration of the role
of attachment in their etiology would
appear imperative.
